### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.

Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?
Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.
In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.
Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.
So the final answer is 44

Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?
Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14
This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29
If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94
The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn
So the final answer is 6

Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?
Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs
He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats
The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs
So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs
So the final answer is 322

Input: Josh’s mom gives him $20 to go shopping at the mall. He buys a hat for $10 and a pencil for $2. Then he buys four cookies. If each cookie costs $1.25, how much money does Josh have left?
Output: After buying a hat, Josh has $20 - $10 = $<<20-10=10>>10
After buying a pencil, Josh has $10 - $2 = $<<10-2=8>>8
The total cost of cookies is 4 * $1.25 = $<<4*1.25=5>>5
After buying the cookies, Josh has $8 - $5 = $<<8-5=3>>3
So the final answer is 3

Input: George's bowling team is one round away from breaking the league record for most points scored in a season. The old record is an average score per player of 287 per round. Each team has 4 players and there are 10 rounds in the season. Through the first 9 rounds, his team has scored a total of 10,440. How many points less than the current league record per game average is the minimum average they need to score, per player, in the final round to tie the league record?
Output: The old team per round record is 1,148 because 287 x 4 = <<1148=1148>>1,148
The team season record is 11,480 because 10 x 1,248 = 11,480
They need 1,040 points in the final round to tie the record because 11,480 - 10,440 = <<11480-10440=1040>>1,040
They need to average 260 points each because 1,040 / 4 = <<1040/4=260>>260
This is 27 points less than the current record average because 287 - 260 = <<27=27>>27
So the final answer is 27

Input: Max was doing homework in three different subjects. It took him 20 minutes to finish tasks from biology and two times more time to finish history. Geography took him the most time, three times more than history. How much time did Max spend on doing his homework?
Output: Max finished history in 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 minutes.
Finishing geography took the most time, which is 40 * 3 = <<40*3=120>>120 minutes.
In total, for all three subjects, Max needed 20 + 40 + 120 = <<20+40+120=180>>180 minutes.
So the final answer is 180

Input: Sophia ate 1/6 of her pie and she put the rest on the fridge. If the pie left in the fridge weighs 1200 grams, how many grams did Sophia eat?
Output: If Sophia ate 1/6 of the pie, then 6/6 - 1/6 = 5/6 is left in the fridge.
Let x be the pie's original weight.
The current weight of the pie can be described by 5x/6=1200 grams
So, 5x=7200.
And, the original weight is x = <<1440=1440>>1440 grams.
So, Sophia ate 1440 grams original - 1200 grams after= <<1440-1200=240>>240 grams of pie.
So the final answer is 240

Input: Sarah, Mary, and Tuan decided to go to the restaurant for a meal. They decided to split the cost of the meal evenly. If the total price of the meal comes to $67 and they have a coupon for $4, how much does each person need to contribute to the bill?
Output: After using the coupon, the final price comes to 67 - 4 = <<67-4=63>>63 dollars.
With three people, they each need to pay 63 / 3 = <<63/3=21>>21 dollars each.
So the final answer is 21

Input: Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog. If in 6 years, Tom's brother will be 30 years, how old is Tom's dog going to be in six years?
Output: If in six years Tom's brother will be 30 years old, he is currently 30-6 = <<30-6=24>>24 years old.
Since Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog, Tom's dog is 24/4 = <<24/4=6>>6 years old currently.
Tom's dog will be 6+6 = <<6+6=12>>12 years old in six years.
So the final answer is 12

Input: There are 50 children at the party. Three-fifths of them are boys. How many of the children are girls?
Output: 50 x 3/5 = <<50*3/5=30>>30 children are boys.
So, there are 50 - 30 = <<50-30=20>>20 children that are girls.
So the final answer is 20

Input: Gail has some bills in her wallet which amount to $100. She has four $5 bills and three $20 bills, and the rest are $10 bills. How many $10 bills are in her wallet?
Output: Four $5 bills amount to $5 x 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
Three $20 bills amount to $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.
So Gail's $5 and $20 bills amount to $20 + $60 = $80.
Thus, her $10 bills amount to $100 - $80 = $20.
Therefore, she has $20/$10 = <<20/10=2>>2 $10 bills.
So the final answer is 2

Input: A 220-liter barrel has a small leak. It lost 10% of its contents before anyone noticed. How many liters are left in the barrel?
Output: The barrel lost 220 * 10 / 100 = <<220*10/100=22>>22 liters before anyone noticed.
So, 220 – 22 = <<220-22=198>>198 liters are left in the barrel.
So the final answer is 198

Input: Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan. Together they earned $37. How many dollars did Markese earn? Use E to represent how many dollars Evan earned.
Output: E = Evan's earnings
Markese's earnings = E - 5
E + E - 5 = 37
2E = 42
E = <<21=21>>21
Evan made $21 so Markese earned 21 - 5 = <<21-5=16>>16
Markese earned $<<16=16>>16.
So the final answer is 16

Input: Lou Senior took 3 cookies out of the cookie jar and ate them.  Since he didn't get caught by his wife, he went back the next day and took another 3 cookies out of the jar.  But after eating just one of the cookies, he felt guilty about it and put the other two cookies back.  His son, Louie Junior saw that his Dad was eating cookies.  So, Louie Junior took seven cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom for later.  The next morning, Debra, Lou's wife looked into the cookie jar and reacted by accusing her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar.  How many cookies remained in the jar?
Output: Lou Sr 3 cookies from the jar, then another three, but then put two back, for a total of 3+3-2=<<3+3-2=4>>4 cookies removed.
Louie Jr took seven more out of the jar, for a total of 4+7=<<4+7=11>>11 cookies removed.
If Debra thought half were gone, then the number of missing cookies would equal the number of cookies that remain, or 11 missing=11 remaining cookies
So the final answer is 11

Input: John had $200. He gave 3/8 of his money to his mother and 3/10 to his father. How much money did John have left?
Output: John's mother received 3/8 x $200 = $<<3/8*200=75>>75.
His father got 3/10 x $200 = $<<3/10*200=60>>60.
Thus, John gave a total of $75 + $60 = $<<75+60=135>>135.
Therefore, John had $200 - $135 = $<<200-135=65>>65 left.
So the final answer is 65

Input: Tonya has $150.00 on her credit card.  If she leaves any balance on her card at the end of the month, she is charged 20% interest.  If she makes a $50.00 payment on her card, what will be the new balance?
Output: Her card has a $150.00 balance and she makes a $50.00 payment so the new balance is 150-50 = $<<150-50=100.00>>100.00
She didn't pay it off so she is charged 20% interest on her $100.00 balance so the interest is.20*100 = $20.00
Her balance was $100.00 and she was charged $20.00 in interest so her new balance is 100+20 = $<<100+20=120.00>>120.00
So the final answer is 120

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.

Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?
Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.
In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.
Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.
So the final answer is 44

Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?
Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14
This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29
If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94
The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn
So the final answer is 6

Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?
Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs
He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats
The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs
So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs
So the final answer is 322

Input: Josh’s mom gives him $20 to go shopping at the mall. He buys a hat for $10 and a pencil for $2. Then he buys four cookies. If each cookie costs $1.25, how much money does Josh have left?
Output: After buying a hat, Josh has $20 - $10 = $<<20-10=10>>10
After buying a pencil, Josh has $10 - $2 = $<<10-2=8>>8
The total cost of cookies is 4 * $1.25 = $<<4*1.25=5>>5
After buying the cookies, Josh has $8 - $5 = $<<8-5=3>>3
So the final answer is 3

Input: George's bowling team is one round away from breaking the league record for most points scored in a season. The old record is an average score per player of 287 per round. Each team has 4 players and there are 10 rounds in the season. Through the first 9 rounds, his team has scored a total of 10,440. How many points less than the current league record per game average is the minimum average they need to score, per player, in the final round to tie the league record?
Output: The old team per round record is 1,148 because 287 x 4 = <<1148=1148>>1,148
The team season record is 11,480 because 10 x 1,248 = 11,480
They need 1,040 points in the final round to tie the record because 11,480 - 10,440 = <<11480-10440=1040>>1,040
They need to average 260 points each because 1,040 / 4 = <<1040/4=260>>260
This is 27 points less than the current record average because 287 - 260 = <<27=27>>27
So the final answer is 27

Input: Max was doing homework in three different subjects. It took him 20 minutes to finish tasks from biology and two times more time to finish history. Geography took him the most time, three times more than history. How much time did Max spend on doing his homework?
Output: Max finished history in 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 minutes.
Finishing geography took the most time, which is 40 * 3 = <<40*3=120>>120 minutes.
In total, for all three subjects, Max needed 20 + 40 + 120 = <<20+40+120=180>>180 minutes.
So the final answer is 180

Input: Sophia ate 1/6 of her pie and she put the rest on the fridge. If the pie left in the fridge weighs 1200 grams, how many grams did Sophia eat?
Output: If Sophia ate 1/6 of the pie, then 6/6 - 1/6 = 5/6 is left in the fridge.
Let x be the pie's original weight.
The current weight of the pie can be described by 5x/6=1200 grams
So, 5x=7200.
And, the original weight is x = <<1440=1440>>1440 grams.
So, Sophia ate 1440 grams original - 1200 grams after= <<1440-1200=240>>240 grams of pie.
So the final answer is 240

Input: Sarah, Mary, and Tuan decided to go to the restaurant for a meal. They decided to split the cost of the meal evenly. If the total price of the meal comes to $67 and they have a coupon for $4, how much does each person need to contribute to the bill?
Output: After using the coupon, the final price comes to 67 - 4 = <<67-4=63>>63 dollars.
With three people, they each need to pay 63 / 3 = <<63/3=21>>21 dollars each.
So the final answer is 21

Input: Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog. If in 6 years, Tom's brother will be 30 years, how old is Tom's dog going to be in six years?
Output: If in six years Tom's brother will be 30 years old, he is currently 30-6 = <<30-6=24>>24 years old.
Since Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog, Tom's dog is 24/4 = <<24/4=6>>6 years old currently.
Tom's dog will be 6+6 = <<6+6=12>>12 years old in six years.
So the final answer is 12

Input: There are 50 children at the party. Three-fifths of them are boys. How many of the children are girls?
Output: 50 x 3/5 = <<50*3/5=30>>30 children are boys.
So, there are 50 - 30 = <<50-30=20>>20 children that are girls.
So the final answer is 20

Input: Gail has some bills in her wallet which amount to $100. She has four $5 bills and three $20 bills, and the rest are $10 bills. How many $10 bills are in her wallet?
Output: Four $5 bills amount to $5 x 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
Three $20 bills amount to $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.
So Gail's $5 and $20 bills amount to $20 + $60 = $80.
Thus, her $10 bills amount to $100 - $80 = $20.
Therefore, she has $20/$10 = <<20/10=2>>2 $10 bills.
So the final answer is 2

Input: A 220-liter barrel has a small leak. It lost 10% of its contents before anyone noticed. How many liters are left in the barrel?
Output: The barrel lost 220 * 10 / 100 = <<220*10/100=22>>22 liters before anyone noticed.
So, 220 – 22 = <<220-22=198>>198 liters are left in the barrel.
So the final answer is 198

Input: Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan. Together they earned $37. How many dollars did Markese earn? Use E to represent how many dollars Evan earned.
Output: E = Evan's earnings
Markese's earnings = E - 5
E + E - 5 = 37
2E = 42
E = <<21=21>>21
Evan made $21 so Markese earned 21 - 5 = <<21-5=16>>16
Markese earned $<<16=16>>16.
So the final answer is 16

Input: Lou Senior took 3 cookies out of the cookie jar and ate them.  Since he didn't get caught by his wife, he went back the next day and took another 3 cookies out of the jar.  But after eating just one of the cookies, he felt guilty about it and put the other two cookies back.  His son, Louie Junior saw that his Dad was eating cookies.  So, Louie Junior took seven cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom for later.  The next morning, Debra, Lou's wife looked into the cookie jar and reacted by accusing her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar.  How many cookies remained in the jar?
Output: Lou Sr 3 cookies from the jar, then another three, but then put two back, for a total of 3+3-2=<<3+3-2=4>>4 cookies removed.
Louie Jr took seven more out of the jar, for a total of 4+7=<<4+7=11>>11 cookies removed.
If Debra thought half were gone, then the number of missing cookies would equal the number of cookies that remain, or 11 missing=11 remaining cookies
So the final answer is 11

Input: John had $200. He gave 3/8 of his money to his mother and 3/10 to his father. How much money did John have left?
Output: John's mother received 3/8 x $200 = $<<3/8*200=75>>75.
His father got 3/10 x $200 = $<<3/10*200=60>>60.
Thus, John gave a total of $75 + $60 = $<<75+60=135>>135.
Therefore, John had $200 - $135 = $<<200-135=65>>65 left.
So the final answer is 65

Input: Tonya has $150.00 on her credit card.  If she leaves any balance on her card at the end of the month, she is charged 20% interest.  If she makes a $50.00 payment on her card, what will be the new balance?
Output: Her card has a $150.00 balance and she makes a $50.00 payment so the new balance is 150-50 = $<<150-50=100.00>>100.00
She didn't pay it off so she is charged 20% interest on her $100.00 balance so the interest is.20*100 = $20.00
Her balance was $100.00 and she was charged $20.00 in interest so her new balance is 100+20 = $<<100+20=120.00>>120.00
So the final answer is 120

Input: In her first term, Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins. Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval in the same amount of time. If Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses, how many commencement addresses did the three of them give altogether?
Output: Since Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses, twice the number that Governor Hawkins gave, Governor Hawkins gave 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 commencement addresses.
The two of them gave 6+12 = <<6+12=18>>18 commencement addresses in total.
Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval, a total of 12+10 = <<12+10=22>>22 commencement addresses.
The three of them gave 22+18 = <<22+18=40>>40 commencement addresses.
So the final answer is 40

Input:The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change? Choices:  A: ignore B: enforce C: authoritarian D: yell at E: avoid

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.

Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?
Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.
In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.
Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.
So the final answer is 44

Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?
Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14
This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29
If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94
The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn
So the final answer is 6

Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?
Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs
He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats
The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs
So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs
So the final answer is 322

Input: Josh’s mom gives him $20 to go shopping at the mall. He buys a hat for $10 and a pencil for $2. Then he buys four cookies. If each cookie costs $1.25, how much money does Josh have left?
Output: After buying a hat, Josh has $20 - $10 = $<<20-10=10>>10
After buying a pencil, Josh has $10 - $2 = $<<10-2=8>>8
The total cost of cookies is 4 * $1.25 = $<<4*1.25=5>>5
After buying the cookies, Josh has $8 - $5 = $<<8-5=3>>3
So the final answer is 3

Input: George's bowling team is one round away from breaking the league record for most points scored in a season. The old record is an average score per player of 287 per round. Each team has 4 players and there are 10 rounds in the season. Through the first 9 rounds, his team has scored a total of 10,440. How many points less than the current league record per game average is the minimum average they need to score, per player, in the final round to tie the league record?
Output: The old team per round record is 1,148 because 287 x 4 = <<1148=1148>>1,148
The team season record is 11,480 because 10 x 1,248 = 11,480
They need 1,040 points in the final round to tie the record because 11,480 - 10,440 = <<11480-10440=1040>>1,040
They need to average 260 points each because 1,040 / 4 = <<1040/4=260>>260
This is 27 points less than the current record average because 287 - 260 = <<27=27>>27
So the final answer is 27

Input: Max was doing homework in three different subjects. It took him 20 minutes to finish tasks from biology and two times more time to finish history. Geography took him the most time, three times more than history. How much time did Max spend on doing his homework?
Output: Max finished history in 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 minutes.
Finishing geography took the most time, which is 40 * 3 = <<40*3=120>>120 minutes.
In total, for all three subjects, Max needed 20 + 40 + 120 = <<20+40+120=180>>180 minutes.
So the final answer is 180

Input: Sophia ate 1/6 of her pie and she put the rest on the fridge. If the pie left in the fridge weighs 1200 grams, how many grams did Sophia eat?
Output: If Sophia ate 1/6 of the pie, then 6/6 - 1/6 = 5/6 is left in the fridge.
Let x be the pie's original weight.
The current weight of the pie can be described by 5x/6=1200 grams
So, 5x=7200.
And, the original weight is x = <<1440=1440>>1440 grams.
So, Sophia ate 1440 grams original - 1200 grams after= <<1440-1200=240>>240 grams of pie.
So the final answer is 240

Input: Sarah, Mary, and Tuan decided to go to the restaurant for a meal. They decided to split the cost of the meal evenly. If the total price of the meal comes to $67 and they have a coupon for $4, how much does each person need to contribute to the bill?
Output: After using the coupon, the final price comes to 67 - 4 = <<67-4=63>>63 dollars.
With three people, they each need to pay 63 / 3 = <<63/3=21>>21 dollars each.
So the final answer is 21

Input: Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog. If in 6 years, Tom's brother will be 30 years, how old is Tom's dog going to be in six years?
Output: If in six years Tom's brother will be 30 years old, he is currently 30-6 = <<30-6=24>>24 years old.
Since Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog, Tom's dog is 24/4 = <<24/4=6>>6 years old currently.
Tom's dog will be 6+6 = <<6+6=12>>12 years old in six years.
So the final answer is 12

Input: There are 50 children at the party. Three-fifths of them are boys. How many of the children are girls?
Output: 50 x 3/5 = <<50*3/5=30>>30 children are boys.
So, there are 50 - 30 = <<50-30=20>>20 children that are girls.
So the final answer is 20

Input: Gail has some bills in her wallet which amount to $100. She has four $5 bills and three $20 bills, and the rest are $10 bills. How many $10 bills are in her wallet?
Output: Four $5 bills amount to $5 x 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
Three $20 bills amount to $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.
So Gail's $5 and $20 bills amount to $20 + $60 = $80.
Thus, her $10 bills amount to $100 - $80 = $20.
Therefore, she has $20/$10 = <<20/10=2>>2 $10 bills.
So the final answer is 2

Input: A 220-liter barrel has a small leak. It lost 10% of its contents before anyone noticed. How many liters are left in the barrel?
Output: The barrel lost 220 * 10 / 100 = <<220*10/100=22>>22 liters before anyone noticed.
So, 220 – 22 = <<220-22=198>>198 liters are left in the barrel.
So the final answer is 198

Input: Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan. Together they earned $37. How many dollars did Markese earn? Use E to represent how many dollars Evan earned.
Output: E = Evan's earnings
Markese's earnings = E - 5
E + E - 5 = 37
2E = 42
E = <<21=21>>21
Evan made $21 so Markese earned 21 - 5 = <<21-5=16>>16
Markese earned $<<16=16>>16.
So the final answer is 16

Input: Lou Senior took 3 cookies out of the cookie jar and ate them.  Since he didn't get caught by his wife, he went back the next day and took another 3 cookies out of the jar.  But after eating just one of the cookies, he felt guilty about it and put the other two cookies back.  His son, Louie Junior saw that his Dad was eating cookies.  So, Louie Junior took seven cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom for later.  The next morning, Debra, Lou's wife looked into the cookie jar and reacted by accusing her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar.  How many cookies remained in the jar?
Output: Lou Sr 3 cookies from the jar, then another three, but then put two back, for a total of 3+3-2=<<3+3-2=4>>4 cookies removed.
Louie Jr took seven more out of the jar, for a total of 4+7=<<4+7=11>>11 cookies removed.
If Debra thought half were gone, then the number of missing cookies would equal the number of cookies that remain, or 11 missing=11 remaining cookies
So the final answer is 11

Input: John had $200. He gave 3/8 of his money to his mother and 3/10 to his father. How much money did John have left?
Output: John's mother received 3/8 x $200 = $<<3/8*200=75>>75.
His father got 3/10 x $200 = $<<3/10*200=60>>60.
Thus, John gave a total of $75 + $60 = $<<75+60=135>>135.
Therefore, John had $200 - $135 = $<<200-135=65>>65 left.
So the final answer is 65

Input: Tonya has $150.00 on her credit card.  If she leaves any balance on her card at the end of the month, she is charged 20% interest.  If she makes a $50.00 payment on her card, what will be the new balance?
Output: Her card has a $150.00 balance and she makes a $50.00 payment so the new balance is 150-50 = $<<150-50=100.00>>100.00
She didn't pay it off so she is charged 20% interest on her $100.00 balance so the interest is.20*100 = $20.00
Her balance was $100.00 and she was charged $20.00 in interest so her new balance is 100+20 = $<<100+20=120.00>>120.00
So the final answer is 120

Input: In her first term, Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins. Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval in the same amount of time. If Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses, how many commencement addresses did the three of them give altogether?
Output: Since Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses, twice the number that Governor Hawkins gave, Governor Hawkins gave 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 commencement addresses.
The two of them gave 6+12 = <<6+12=18>>18 commencement addresses in total.
Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval, a total of 12+10 = <<12+10=22>>22 commencement addresses.
The three of them gave 22+18 = <<22+18=40>>40 commencement addresses.
So the final answer is 40

Input: If Buzz bought a pizza with 78 slices at a restaurant and then decided to share it with the waiter in the ratio of 5:8, with Buzz's ratio being 5, what's twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate?
Output: The total ratio representing the slices of pizza that Buzz bought is 5+8=<<5+8=13>>13
If he shared the slices of pizza with the waiter, the waiter received a fraction of 8/13 of the total number of slices, which totals 8/13 * 78 = <<8/13*78=48>>48 slices
Twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate is 48-20 = <<48-20=28>>28
So the final answer is 28

Input: Jolene and Phil have four children, each with the same birthday.  They gave birth to their first child exactly 15 years ago.  They gave birth to their second child exactly one year after the birth of their first child.  They gave birth to their third child on the fourth birthday of their second child. Two years after the birth of their third child, they gave birth to their fourth child.  How old, in years, is their fourth child?
Output: Their 1st child was born 15 years ago, and therefore is <<15=15>>15 years old.
Their 2nd child was born 1 year after their 15-year-old child, and therefore is 15-1=<<15-1=14>>14 years old.
Their 3rd child was born 4 years after their 14-year-old child, and therefore is 14-4=10 years old.
Their 4th child was born 2 years after their 10-year-old child, and therefore is 10-2=8 years old.
So the final answer is 8

Input:The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change? Choices:  A: ignore B: enforce C: authoritarian D: yell at E: avoid

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.

Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?
Output: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.
In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.
Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.
So the final answer is 44

Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?
Output: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14
This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29
If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94
The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn
So the final answer is 6

Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?
Output: His kangaroos have a total of 23*2=<<23*2=46>>46 legs
He has 23*3=<<23*3=69>>69 goats
The goats have 69*4=<<69*4=276>>276 legs
So in total his animals have 276+46=<<276+46=322>>322 legs
So the final answer is 322

Input: Josh’s mom gives him $20 to go shopping at the mall. He buys a hat for $10 and a pencil for $2. Then he buys four cookies. If each cookie costs $1.25, how much money does Josh have left?
Output: After buying a hat, Josh has $20 - $10 = $<<20-10=10>>10
After buying a pencil, Josh has $10 - $2 = $<<10-2=8>>8
The total cost of cookies is 4 * $1.25 = $<<4*1.25=5>>5
After buying the cookies, Josh has $8 - $5 = $<<8-5=3>>3
So the final answer is 3

Input: George's bowling team is one round away from breaking the league record for most points scored in a season. The old record is an average score per player of 287 per round. Each team has 4 players and there are 10 rounds in the season. Through the first 9 rounds, his team has scored a total of 10,440. How many points less than the current league record per game average is the minimum average they need to score, per player, in the final round to tie the league record?
Output: The old team per round record is 1,148 because 287 x 4 = <<1148=1148>>1,148
The team season record is 11,480 because 10 x 1,248 = 11,480
They need 1,040 points in the final round to tie the record because 11,480 - 10,440 = <<11480-10440=1040>>1,040
They need to average 260 points each because 1,040 / 4 = <<1040/4=260>>260
This is 27 points less than the current record average because 287 - 260 = <<27=27>>27
So the final answer is 27

Input: Max was doing homework in three different subjects. It took him 20 minutes to finish tasks from biology and two times more time to finish history. Geography took him the most time, three times more than history. How much time did Max spend on doing his homework?
Output: Max finished history in 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 minutes.
Finishing geography took the most time, which is 40 * 3 = <<40*3=120>>120 minutes.
In total, for all three subjects, Max needed 20 + 40 + 120 = <<20+40+120=180>>180 minutes.
So the final answer is 180

Input: Sophia ate 1/6 of her pie and she put the rest on the fridge. If the pie left in the fridge weighs 1200 grams, how many grams did Sophia eat?
Output: If Sophia ate 1/6 of the pie, then 6/6 - 1/6 = 5/6 is left in the fridge.
Let x be the pie's original weight.
The current weight of the pie can be described by 5x/6=1200 grams
So, 5x=7200.
And, the original weight is x = <<1440=1440>>1440 grams.
So, Sophia ate 1440 grams original - 1200 grams after= <<1440-1200=240>>240 grams of pie.
So the final answer is 240

Input: Sarah, Mary, and Tuan decided to go to the restaurant for a meal. They decided to split the cost of the meal evenly. If the total price of the meal comes to $67 and they have a coupon for $4, how much does each person need to contribute to the bill?
Output: After using the coupon, the final price comes to 67 - 4 = <<67-4=63>>63 dollars.
With three people, they each need to pay 63 / 3 = <<63/3=21>>21 dollars each.
So the final answer is 21

Input: Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog. If in 6 years, Tom's brother will be 30 years, how old is Tom's dog going to be in six years?
Output: If in six years Tom's brother will be 30 years old, he is currently 30-6 = <<30-6=24>>24 years old.
Since Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog, Tom's dog is 24/4 = <<24/4=6>>6 years old currently.
Tom's dog will be 6+6 = <<6+6=12>>12 years old in six years.
So the final answer is 12

Input: There are 50 children at the party. Three-fifths of them are boys. How many of the children are girls?
Output: 50 x 3/5 = <<50*3/5=30>>30 children are boys.
So, there are 50 - 30 = <<50-30=20>>20 children that are girls.
So the final answer is 20

Input: Gail has some bills in her wallet which amount to $100. She has four $5 bills and three $20 bills, and the rest are $10 bills. How many $10 bills are in her wallet?
Output: Four $5 bills amount to $5 x 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
Three $20 bills amount to $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.
So Gail's $5 and $20 bills amount to $20 + $60 = $80.
Thus, her $10 bills amount to $100 - $80 = $20.
Therefore, she has $20/$10 = <<20/10=2>>2 $10 bills.
So the final answer is 2

Input: A 220-liter barrel has a small leak. It lost 10% of its contents before anyone noticed. How many liters are left in the barrel?
Output: The barrel lost 220 * 10 / 100 = <<220*10/100=22>>22 liters before anyone noticed.
So, 220 – 22 = <<220-22=198>>198 liters are left in the barrel.
So the final answer is 198

Input: Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan. Together they earned $37. How many dollars did Markese earn? Use E to represent how many dollars Evan earned.
Output: E = Evan's earnings
Markese's earnings = E - 5
E + E - 5 = 37
2E = 42
E = <<21=21>>21
Evan made $21 so Markese earned 21 - 5 = <<21-5=16>>16
Markese earned $<<16=16>>16.
So the final answer is 16

Input: Lou Senior took 3 cookies out of the cookie jar and ate them.  Since he didn't get caught by his wife, he went back the next day and took another 3 cookies out of the jar.  But after eating just one of the cookies, he felt guilty about it and put the other two cookies back.  His son, Louie Junior saw that his Dad was eating cookies.  So, Louie Junior took seven cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom for later.  The next morning, Debra, Lou's wife looked into the cookie jar and reacted by accusing her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar.  How many cookies remained in the jar?
Output: Lou Sr 3 cookies from the jar, then another three, but then put two back, for a total of 3+3-2=<<3+3-2=4>>4 cookies removed.
Louie Jr took seven more out of the jar, for a total of 4+7=<<4+7=11>>11 cookies removed.
If Debra thought half were gone, then the number of missing cookies would equal the number of cookies that remain, or 11 missing=11 remaining cookies
So the final answer is 11

Input: John had $200. He gave 3/8 of his money to his mother and 3/10 to his father. How much money did John have left?
Output: John's mother received 3/8 x $200 = $<<3/8*200=75>>75.
His father got 3/10 x $200 = $<<3/10*200=60>>60.
Thus, John gave a total of $75 + $60 = $<<75+60=135>>135.
Therefore, John had $200 - $135 = $<<200-135=65>>65 left.
So the final answer is 65

Input: Tonya has $150.00 on her credit card.  If she leaves any balance on her card at the end of the month, she is charged 20% interest.  If she makes a $50.00 payment on her card, what will be the new balance?
Output: Her card has a $150.00 balance and she makes a $50.00 payment so the new balance is 150-50 = $<<150-50=100.00>>100.00
She didn't pay it off so she is charged 20% interest on her $100.00 balance so the interest is.20*100 = $20.00
Her balance was $100.00 and she was charged $20.00 in interest so her new balance is 100+20 = $<<100+20=120.00>>120.00
So the final answer is 120

Input: In her first term, Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins. Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval in the same amount of time. If Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses, how many commencement addresses did the three of them give altogether?
Output: Since Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses, twice the number that Governor Hawkins gave, Governor Hawkins gave 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 commencement addresses.
The two of them gave 6+12 = <<6+12=18>>18 commencement addresses in total.
Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval, a total of 12+10 = <<12+10=22>>22 commencement addresses.
The three of them gave 22+18 = <<22+18=40>>40 commencement addresses.
So the final answer is 40

Input: If Buzz bought a pizza with 78 slices at a restaurant and then decided to share it with the waiter in the ratio of 5:8, with Buzz's ratio being 5, what's twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate?
Output: The total ratio representing the slices of pizza that Buzz bought is 5+8=<<5+8=13>>13
If he shared the slices of pizza with the waiter, the waiter received a fraction of 8/13 of the total number of slices, which totals 8/13 * 78 = <<8/13*78=48>>48 slices
Twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate is 48-20 = <<48-20=28>>28
So the final answer is 28

Input: Jolene and Phil have four children, each with the same birthday.  They gave birth to their first child exactly 15 years ago.  They gave birth to their second child exactly one year after the birth of their first child.  They gave birth to their third child on the fourth birthday of their second child. Two years after the birth of their third child, they gave birth to their fourth child.  How old, in years, is their fourth child?
Output: Their 1st child was born 15 years ago, and therefore is <<15=15>>15 years old.
Their 2nd child was born 1 year after their 15-year-old child, and therefore is 15-1=<<15-1=14>>14 years old.
Their 3rd child was born 4 years after their 14-year-old child, and therefore is 14-4=10 years old.
Their 4th child was born 2 years after their 10-year-old child, and therefore is 10-2=8 years old.
So the final answer is 8

Input: Each purple book has 230 pages. Each orange book contains 510 pages. Mirella read 5 purple books and 4 orange books. How many more orange pages did she read than purple pages?
Output: Purple = 5 * 230 = <<5*230=1150>>1150 pages
Orange = 4 * 510 = <<4*510=2040>>2040 pages
2040 - 1150 = <<2040-1150=890>>890
Mirella read 890 more orange pages than purple pages.
So the final answer is 890

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.

Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?
Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.
And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.
So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.
So the final answer is 56

Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?
Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up
So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day
That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym
So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week
So the final answer is 4

Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?
Output: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40
So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank
That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480
So the final answer is 480

Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.
Output: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.
If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.
So the final answer is 30

Input: Every day Tom drinks 5 12-oz cans of soda plus 64 ounces of water. How many ounces of fluid does he drink a week?
Output: He drinks 12 * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 ounces of soda a day
So he drinks 60 + 64 = <<60+64=124>>124 ounces of liquid a day
So in total he drinks 124 * 7 = <<124*7=868>>868 ounces of liquid a week
So the final answer is 868

Input: Stella and Twinkle are filling up a truck with a capacity of 6000 stone blocks at the rate of 250 blocks per hour per person. They work for four hours and are then joined by 6 other people who also work at the same rate. How many hours did filling the truck take?
Output: Stella and Twinkle filled up the truck at the rate of 250 blocks per hour per person, a total of 2*250 = <<250*2=500>>500 blocks per hour for both.
After working for four hours, Stella and Twinkle had filled 4*500 = <<4*500=2000>>2000 blocks into the truck.
The number of blocks they had to put into the truck for it to be full is 6000-2000 = <<6000-2000=4000>>4000
When 6 more people joined Stella and Twinkle, a total of 2+6 = <<2+6=8>>8 people were filling the truck now.
Working at the rate of 250 blocks per person, the eight people filled the truck with 250*8 = <<250*8=2000>>2000 blocks in one hour.
If there were 4000 blocks that still needed to be put into the truck, the 8 people took 4000/2000 = <<4000/2000=2>>2 hours to fill the truck with the blocks.
The total time it took to fill up the tank is 4+2 = <<4+2=6>>6 hours.
So the final answer is 6

Input: Elijah drank 8.5 pints of coffee yesterday. Emilio drank 9.5 pints of water yesterday. How many cups of liquid did the two boys drink yesterday?
Output: Total drunk: 8.5 + 9.5 = <<8.5+9.5=18>>18 pints
18 pints * 2 = <<18*2=36>>36 cups
The two boys drank a total of 36 cups of liquid yesterday.
So the final answer is 36

Input: Doris works at the Widget Factory in the packing department. She puts 3 widgets in each carton, which are 4 inches wide, 4 inches long, and 5 inches tall. She then packs those cartons into a shipping box before sending it to the loading bay. The shipping boxes are 20 inches wide, 20 inches long, and 20 inches high. How many widgets get shipped in each shipping box?
Output: Each carton has an area of 4*4*5 = <<4*4*5=80>>80 square inches.
Each shipping box has an area of 20*20*20 = <<20*20*20=8000>>8000 square inches
The total number of cartons that will fit into each box is 8000/80 = <<8000/80=100>>100
Since there are 3 widgets in each carton, the total number of cartons in each box will be 3*100 = <<3*100=300>>300
So the final answer is 300

Input: Queenie earns $150 a day as a part-time clerk. She earns an additional $5 per hour as overtime pay. How much will Queenie receive for working 5 days with 4 hours overtime?
Output: Queenie will earn $150 x 5 = $<<150*5=750>>750 for working 5 days.
She will receive an additional $5 x 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20 for overtime pay.
Hence, Queenie will receive a total of $750 + $20 = $<<750+20=770>>770.
So the final answer is 770

Input: Jodi starts off walking 1 mile a day for 6 days a week.  On the second week, she walks 2 miles a day, 6 days a week.  On the third week, she walks 3 miles a day, 6 days a week. Finally on the fourth week, she walks 4 miles a day, 6 days a week.  How many miles has she walked in 4 weeks?
Output: The first week she walked 1 mile, 6 days a week for a total of 1*6 = <<1*6=6>>6 miles
The second week she walked 2 miles, 6 days a week for a total of 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 miles
The third week she walked 3 miles, 6 days a week for a total of 3*6 = <<3*6=18>>18 miles
On the fourth week, she walked 4 miles, 6 days a week for a total of 4*6 = <<4*6=24>>24 miles
Over four weeks she has walked 6+12+18+24 = <<6+12+18+24=60>>60 miles
So the final answer is 60

Input: A club is going to get additional members so that they will have 5 more than twice their current number of their members. If the club has 10 members now, how many additional members do they need?
Output: Twice the current number of members now is 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 members
So, the club wants to have 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 members.
Therefore, they need to get 25 - 10 = <<25-10=15>>15 members.
So the final answer is 15

Input: Andrea buys herself a pony for her 30th birthday. She pays $500/month to rent a pasture for it, $10 a day for food, and $60/lesson for two lessons a week. How much does she spend on her pony in a year?
Output: First find the annual cost of food: $10/day * 365 days = $<<10*365=3650>>3650
Then find how much she spends a week on lessons: $60/lesson * 2 lessons = $<<60*2=120>>120
Then multiply that weekly cost by the number of weeks per year to find the annual cost: $120/week * 52 weeks/year = $<<120*52=6240>>6240
Then find the annual cost of the pasture: $500/month * 12 months/year = $<<500*12=6000>>6000
Then add all the costs to find the total cost: $6000 + $6240 + $3650 = $<<6000+6240+3650=15890>>15890
So the final answer is 15890

Input: A pet shop has 2 puppies and some kittens. A puppy costs $20, and a kitten costs $15. If the stock is worth $100, how many kittens does the pet shop have?
Output: The 2 puppies cost 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 dollars
The stock is worth 100 dollars, meaning that the kittens cost 100 - 40 = <<100-40=60>>60 dollars
Since the cost of a kitten is 15 dollars, the pet shop has 60/15 = <<60/15=4>>4 kittens
So the final answer is 4

Input: Noah, who loves his Grammy, calls her every week to talk about his day. If each call lasts 30 minutes and he is charged $0.05 per call minute, how much would he be billed if he makes the calls for a year?
Output: A year has 52 weeks, so if he talks for 30 minutes every week, the total number of call hours is 52*30 = <<52*30=1560>>1560 minutes.
Since he is charged 0.05 cents per call, the total cost is 1560*.05 = <<1560*.05=78>>78 dollars
So the final answer is 78

Input: A merchant bought 15 keyboards and 25 printers for a total of $2050. If a keyboard costs $20, how much does a printer cost?
Output: 15 keyboards at $20 per keyboard cost a total of 15*$20=$<<15*20=300>>300
The total cost of printers and keyboards is $2050 so 25 printers cost $2050-$300=$<<2050-300=1750>>1750
1 printer cost $1750/25=$<<1750/25=70>>70
So the final answer is 70

Input: Gina has two bank accounts. Each account has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account. If Betty's account balance is $3,456, what is the combined balance of both Gina's accounts?
Output: Each of Gina's account has $3456 / 4 accounts = $<<3456/4=864>>864/account
Her combined account balance is therefore $864 + $864 = $<<864+864=1728>>1728
So the final answer is 1728

Input:The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change? Choices:  A: ignore B: enforce C: authoritarian D: yell at E: avoid

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.

Input: Adam bought 3 kilograms of nuts and 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits at a store. One kilogram of nuts costs $12 and one kilogram of dried fruit costs $8. How much did his purchases cost?
Output: For the nuts Adam paid 3 * $12 = $<<3*12=36>>36.
And for dried fruits Adam paid 2.5 * $8 = $<<2.5*8=20>>20.
So in total for his purchases Adam paid $36 + $20 = $<<36+20=56>>56.
So the final answer is 56

Input: Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?
Output: He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up
So he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day
That means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym
So he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week
So the final answer is 4

Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?
Output: The cost to fill a tank went up 200*.2=$<<200*.2=40>>40
So it cost 200+40=$<<200+40=240>>240 to fill the tank
That means he now pays 240*2=$<<240*2=480>>480
So the final answer is 480

Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.
Output: If the total number of goals scored in the league that season against Barca is 300, the two players scored 20/100*300=<<300*20/100=60>>60 goals.
If the players scored an equal number of goals, each scored 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 goals.
So the final answer is 30

Input: Every day Tom drinks 5 12-oz cans of soda plus 64 ounces of water. How many ounces of fluid does he drink a week?
Output: He drinks 12 * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 ounces of soda a day
So he drinks 60 + 64 = <<60+64=124>>124 ounces of liquid a day
So in total he drinks 124 * 7 = <<124*7=868>>868 ounces of liquid a week
So the final answer is 868

Input: Stella and Twinkle are filling up a truck with a capacity of 6000 stone blocks at the rate of 250 blocks per hour per person. They work for four hours and are then joined by 6 other people who also work at the same rate. How many hours did filling the truck take?
Output: Stella and Twinkle filled up the truck at the rate of 250 blocks per hour per person, a total of 2*250 = <<250*2=500>>500 blocks per hour for both.
After working for four hours, Stella and Twinkle had filled 4*500 = <<4*500=2000>>2000 blocks into the truck.
The number of blocks they had to put into the truck for it to be full is 6000-2000 = <<6000-2000=4000>>4000
When 6 more people joined Stella and Twinkle, a total of 2+6 = <<2+6=8>>8 people were filling the truck now.
Working at the rate of 250 blocks per person, the eight people filled the truck with 250*8 = <<250*8=2000>>2000 blocks in one hour.
If there were 4000 blocks that still needed to be put into the truck, the 8 people took 4000/2000 = <<4000/2000=2>>2 hours to fill the truck with the blocks.
The total time it took to fill up the tank is 4+2 = <<4+2=6>>6 hours.
So the final answer is 6

Input: Elijah drank 8.5 pints of coffee yesterday. Emilio drank 9.5 pints of water yesterday. How many cups of liquid did the two boys drink yesterday?
Output: Total drunk: 8.5 + 9.5 = <<8.5+9.5=18>>18 pints
18 pints * 2 = <<18*2=36>>36 cups
The two boys drank a total of 36 cups of liquid yesterday.
So the final answer is 36

Input: Doris works at the Widget Factory in the packing department. She puts 3 widgets in each carton, which are 4 inches wide, 4 inches long, and 5 inches tall. She then packs those cartons into a shipping box before sending it to the loading bay. The shipping boxes are 20 inches wide, 20 inches long, and 20 inches high. How many widgets get shipped in each shipping box?
Output: Each carton has an area of 4*4*5 = <<4*4*5=80>>80 square inches.
Each shipping box has an area of 20*20*20 = <<20*20*20=8000>>8000 square inches
The total number of cartons that will fit into each box is 8000/80 = <<8000/80=100>>100
Since there are 3 widgets in each carton, the total number of cartons in each box will be 3*100 = <<3*100=300>>300
So the final answer is 300

Input: Queenie earns $150 a day as a part-time clerk. She earns an additional $5 per hour as overtime pay. How much will Queenie receive for working 5 days with 4 hours overtime?
Output: Queenie will earn $150 x 5 = $<<150*5=750>>750 for working 5 days.
She will receive an additional $5 x 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20 for overtime pay.
Hence, Queenie will receive a total of $750 + $20 = $<<750+20=770>>770.
So the final answer is 770

Input: Jodi starts off walking 1 mile a day for 6 days a week.  On the second week, she walks 2 miles a day, 6 days a week.  On the third week, she walks 3 miles a day, 6 days a week. Finally on the fourth week, she walks 4 miles a day, 6 days a week.  How many miles has she walked in 4 weeks?
Output: The first week she walked 1 mile, 6 days a week for a total of 1*6 = <<1*6=6>>6 miles
The second week she walked 2 miles, 6 days a week for a total of 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 miles
The third week she walked 3 miles, 6 days a week for a total of 3*6 = <<3*6=18>>18 miles
On the fourth week, she walked 4 miles, 6 days a week for a total of 4*6 = <<4*6=24>>24 miles
Over four weeks she has walked 6+12+18+24 = <<6+12+18+24=60>>60 miles
So the final answer is 60

Input: A club is going to get additional members so that they will have 5 more than twice their current number of their members. If the club has 10 members now, how many additional members do they need?
Output: Twice the current number of members now is 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 members
So, the club wants to have 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 members.
Therefore, they need to get 25 - 10 = <<25-10=15>>15 members.
So the final answer is 15

Input: Andrea buys herself a pony for her 30th birthday. She pays $500/month to rent a pasture for it, $10 a day for food, and $60/lesson for two lessons a week. How much does she spend on her pony in a year?
Output: First find the annual cost of food: $10/day * 365 days = $<<10*365=3650>>3650
Then find how much she spends a week on lessons: $60/lesson * 2 lessons = $<<60*2=120>>120
Then multiply that weekly cost by the number of weeks per year to find the annual cost: $120/week * 52 weeks/year = $<<120*52=6240>>6240
Then find the annual cost of the pasture: $500/month * 12 months/year = $<<500*12=6000>>6000
Then add all the costs to find the total cost: $6000 + $6240 + $3650 = $<<6000+6240+3650=15890>>15890
So the final answer is 15890

Input: A pet shop has 2 puppies and some kittens. A puppy costs $20, and a kitten costs $15. If the stock is worth $100, how many kittens does the pet shop have?
Output: The 2 puppies cost 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 dollars
The stock is worth 100 dollars, meaning that the kittens cost 100 - 40 = <<100-40=60>>60 dollars
Since the cost of a kitten is 15 dollars, the pet shop has 60/15 = <<60/15=4>>4 kittens
So the final answer is 4

Input: Noah, who loves his Grammy, calls her every week to talk about his day. If each call lasts 30 minutes and he is charged $0.05 per call minute, how much would he be billed if he makes the calls for a year?
Output: A year has 52 weeks, so if he talks for 30 minutes every week, the total number of call hours is 52*30 = <<52*30=1560>>1560 minutes.
Since he is charged 0.05 cents per call, the total cost is 1560*.05 = <<1560*.05=78>>78 dollars
So the final answer is 78

Input:The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change? Choices:  A: ignore B: enforce C: authoritarian D: yell at E: avoid

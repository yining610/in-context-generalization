While that doesn't guarantee emotional distress, that person is probably going to be a little embarrassed.\n\n### Challenge: Explain in words why the response for #1, #2 and #3 are not correct.\n\n### Solution: In the first problem, we are asked to solve the equation 5 < 3(x + y) = 90. As the less-than sign is on the left side of the equal sign, we want to solve for x or y. In order to solve this equation, we can subtract x from both sides. After subtracting it from both sides we get 4<3y. If we add 5 to both sides we get 9>3y. After factoring 3y, we get 9>y. The largest value of y that would satisfy all 9>y would be 1. Since we only have a two-digit number, it must be between 0 and 9. Since the value of y we are looking for has to be less than 5, the answer is 55.\n\nThe second problem is asking us to solve 330(x - 53) = 249. Since this equation has the same order of operations at the bottom and top, you would subtract 53 from both sides of the equation. After subtracting it, we have 277 + 49 = 326. Now add the 277 to both sides of the equation and we have 326 + 277 = 603. Then we factor 603 to get 326 = 2x. After taking the positive of both sides, now we have 327 = 2x. Now, we need to figure out what x represents in the equation. Since we have three digits, we divide both sides by 7. After doing that, we get 48=2x, which can be solved as 2x=24. Since our second part of the equation is (x-53), we still need to subtract 53 from", "answer": "B: emotional distress"}

{"text": "Input: A virus can multiply by replicating, making copies of itself, inside your human cells. They also do damage to human cells by making mistakes such\nas deleting part of a cell\u2019s DNA sequence.\n### Output:What does a virus replicate itself?\nInput: A virus typically replicates in your cells\u2019 cytoplasm as they reproduce. However, replicating occurs differently for various viruses. As a virus replicates,\nit typically can\u2019t take the place of an unaffected cell\u2019s DNA without causing damage that could end your life. It sometimes infects other cells and replicates\nwith them. Other viruses just stay in your body, using your cellular machinery to make copies of themselves. Some people\u2019s cells can\u2019t tell that they\u2019re\ninfected, which allows them to live for a long time.\n### Output(2): What types of cells can a virus infect?  Choices: A \u2013 B cells B \u2013 skin and hair C \u2013 blood cells D \u2013 muscle and bone E \u2013 sperm and egg \n\n### Output(3): What happens after the virus attacks in a person\nInput: Your immune system can fight off viruses by developing antibodies against the offending virus. The antibodies destroy any viruses in your\nbody that the immune system identifies. Once your body makes antibodies, they remain in your system. This is why people can get sick from the same\nvirus more than once.\n\n### Output (4): what can some things we can take to prevent virus getting affected by virus?\n\nInput: Some things you can do to prevent the flu include washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your eyes or nose, and getting an annual flu\nvaccination. Vaccines help your immune system recognize and fight the flu virus by introducing a small amount of the dead flu virus. Your immune\nsystem recognizes the virus and learns to fight it, which then protects you against serious infection. The vaccination helps keep the flu at bay.", "answer": "A: infect"}

{"text": "I think the answer to the problem is option A: Television. As we can infer from the given context that we need to clean the attic of the house, cleaning the attic during this time may cause dust to fall onto the television.\n\n### Input and Output Explanation The given equation is 53(53 - x) = 53(55 - 7) To solve for  x we need to subtract 7 from 55 and then subtract 53 from both sides. Thus, the answer to option 2 is 36 \n\n### Input 3\nThe question given is \"He made sure to clean the, dust of his\" We think that B is correct since it's an incorrect sentence for option A.  \n\n### Input/Output Explanation\nThe given equation is: 19-x = 19 To simplify the equation, we can subtract 19 on both sides: (-x) = -19 Now the equation becomes x = 19 We know that no number minus itself results to a negative, and that x is the unknown variable. Thus, option D would be the correct answer.\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer to all four questions was options B for all, and 3 for the last two.", "answer": "A: television"}

He needs two to three new tires for the golf cart he uses, which costs $390. If he has been tipping his boss 15% of his total salary, what is the minimum amount of money that he would need to tip the boss and still meet the cost of the tires?\nAnswer: 20% of $13.0 is $2.60. 20 of $2.60 is $52\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe answer to the above question was incorrect.\n\nJesse makes $232.0 for every seven working days, therefore his hourly wage is $33.34. His salary per year is $72,800.\n\nAccording to the equation, he pays 2.6% of his annual salary in tipping, which is $1,895.92.\n\nThis is greater than the cost of the tire ($390), which comes out to a negative number, so Jesse will not be able to buy the tires.\n\nCorrect answer: 20%\n\nThe question is correct.\n\nComment: So I took the question and added one to the number before multiplying by the percent value.

A function contains one step and is an implementation of a mathematical expression.\n\nInput: Find the value x such that x = x + 2.\nAnswer: This question is asking you to find the solution to an equaiton, so the answer to this is that x = 3.\n\nInput: A number x is called a factor of another number y if it divides y evenly.\nAnswer: This is a function. A function requires you to know what x is in order to call the function. In this case, we are not told what x is so this is an algorithm.\n\nInput: If a number is divisible by 3 and divisible by 5 is it divisble by 15?\nAnswer: This a function. It does not give you a function of the inputs but of all inputs.\n\nInput: Count the number of 5\u2019s divisible by 2.\nAnswer(s): This is an algorithm. The question asks you to count the number of 5s divisible by 5 and does not give you a single step.\n\nThere are countless functions available to use in this challenge. This challenge is meant to serve as an opportunity to have a refresher on topics you likely covered in math class if not on your own. We will only cover two common functions that have to do with counting.\n\nFor our first example, let\u2019s count the number of 0\u2019s in N=123. There are 2 0\u2019s. To start, count the number of 1\u2019s, 2\u2019s, 3\u2019s, and so on until you arrive at 0. There are 3 0\u2019s total. Therefore, we divide by 3 to get the fraction \u2153. But wait, there are two 0\u2019s in the word N! To account for this, we divide by 2 to obtain the final result of 125/3%.\n\nFor our second example, let\u2019s say that", "answer": "E: law suit"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Explanation\nThe instruction in the box above is a multiple choice question. You are expected to respond to the question by appropriately completing it. The way you choose must be based on the information you have available. Here you will have a choice between the following options: A, B, C, D, and E. As you read the question, think about what information is provided and what is left out. You will see that the key information to remember is the phrase \u201cFor convenience some customers.\u201d This tells you that the information you are missing probably relates to why the company wants things to go straight to the doorstep. If you can figure out this missing information, you will come up with the correct answer.\n\n*A. mail order.*\nBy definition, mail order means that orders are sent through the mail. If, however, customers were ordering things on the Internet, they would probably want their packages delivered straight to their doorsteps. It is the latter form of ordering that the question is talking about. Customers who order things on the Internet want their things delivered to the door. Therefore, answer A.\n\n*B. demand satisfaction.*\nDemand satisfaction is a concept commonly used in economics. Demand satisfaction means that a customer\u2019s wants and needs are met. In this context, however, the phrase \u201cconvenience for customers\u201d is used. If you are a customer, you may want to go to a place where you can get what you need quickly, easily, and conveniently, perhaps by going straight to the front door. Therefore, demand satisfaction probably does not relate to what the company is doing.\n\n*C. pay merchant with money. *\nMoney in this case may mean either currency or debit card or credit card. Money may also refer to either checks or cash. Either way, payment is usually made by money, so this choice is incorrect.\n\n*D. spend money.*\nIf you are a customer, this choice describes you. You are expected to spend money. You would probably spend money either at a store or online. These are the only two places customers can easily spend money. Therefore, this choice is incorrect. Choices A, B, and C are eliminated because money cannot be used to satisfy a demand.\n\n*E. place money on counter.*\nThe idea of placing money on a counter indicates that you are a seller. Sellers are expected to take", "answer": "A: mail orders"}

{"text": "### Explanation:\n\n#### Sample of Correct Answer 1 of 7 Points:\nBased on the given statement, it can be interpreted that the cat should meow. In order to get the correct answer based on the given statement, meow has to be the only suitable answer.\n\n#### Sample of Incorrect Answer 2 of 7 Points\n\nIn the statement \u201cthe cat should meow,\u201d the author refers to the cats. As the statement is about the cats, this type of question should be answered based on the facts whether the cat actually meows or not. To get the correct answer here, we should ask what type of animal usually meow? The answer will be either dog, cow or human since all those animals have the ability to meow.\n\nAs cow or dog can not answer in yes or no, only the humans are able to answer in yes or no. Therefore we can answer C.\n\n#### Sample Incorrect Answer 3 of 7 Points \n\nThe given statement \u201cWhat would you normally expect the cat to say?\u201d can be interpreted that meow will be the only correct answer. Whenever the author asks about what would you normally expect the something to be, meow will be the correct answer.\n\n#### Incorrect Answer 4 of 7 Points Sample \n\nAs the answer to sample 2 is incorrect this means that C is indeed the correct answer to this question. However the previous statement was not sufficient to answer the question.\n\nWe now need to further ask if the cat can meow or not, and if it can meow, then does it meow. If it does meow, then we are back on track, and if the cat does not meow, then C will again be the answer.\n\n#### Other Options 5, 6, 7 points\n\nTo get the correct answer based only on the given statement, we are required to be very precise in the interpretation of the question and the statement.\n\n**Answer 1**\n\n**Error** The cat should meow. \n\n#### Answer 2\n\n**Error** In the statement \u201cthe cat is going to meow\u201d the author refers to the cat. As the question is about the cat, the author should focus on only the cat not the dog or the human animal. This type of question should be answering based on the information of whether the cat", "answer": "C: meow"}

This will be a simple program, that shows your basic understanding of the concepts we have learned so far. For this program you create two objects. One is a Dog, the other a Clock.  \n\nYou will start with the Dog. You\u2019ll use the createInstance method to create a Dog object. You'll call the createInstance method on yourself, where you are the constructor. You can call the constructor in an if and else statement. You can then call toString to print an Hello World! to the console.\n\nYou will call the createInstance method of the Clock object. This will produce an object with a constructor property called createInstance and call it from within the body of the Clock object class constructor.\n\nAs the Dog class constructor, you will call this method and pass it the Dog object constructor. Since the string argument is a variable,  the Clock object will look at this arguments value and try to find a value defined in the constructor. If you don\u2019t define this argument, it will default to a zero and provide you with an empty constructor when the clock calls the createInstance method on the Dog object. You can also call createInstance() on the clock and pass in the Dog object constructor. The clock will now provide you with a default clock time, but you will lose the time the Dog object gave you. You can check to see if you've passed an argument to the Dog object, by checking Dog.constructor.arguments \n\nYou will print the string to the console for the Clock object  and print the values of the Dog object properties like you did earlier. The Dog object will now have an hour, minute, and second set and the clock will also be set with that time. The Dog will have to be set and the clock will have to be set with the initial time of the Dog.\n\nYou will print to the console the value of the hour and the minutes. The clock will print to the console a new time every hour. The Dog will print the hour of the clock. The Dog and the Clock will now run at the same time and as the Dog class. You will now pass in the Dog object as opposed to the Dog object constructor to the clock createInstance method. You will now get the hour and minute from the Dog object and will only", "answer": "E: desk"}

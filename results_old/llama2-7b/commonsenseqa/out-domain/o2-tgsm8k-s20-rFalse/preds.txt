Each function has a name. This name is created using some rules and a naming convention. Here are some of these rules and conventions:<n><n>- Every function must have a name that is unique and not used by another function.<n>- Every function name must start with a letter and a letter may not be followed by a number.<n>- Every function declaration name must be followed by a pair of parentheses, followed by the function's parameters, followed by the return value (or the type of the function's return value).<n><n>Now that those rules have been clarified, here is an example function declaration which will be used later. The function will take in a number (input) and perform a mathematical operation on the number (3), and the function will return a single number (output).<n><n>![A function takes in an amount of data, or an input. It performs some task, or operation, on this data.](/assets/img/posts/30-data-input-and-function-results.png)<n><n>In computer programming languages, a function always returns, or yields, a single value to a caller in every single invocation. This means that if anyone calls the function, they get back the same result.<n><n>A function can be called by its own name. For example, in this function call: foo(10) <n><n>## Requirements Summary<n><n>1. A function takes in some information, performs a calculation, and returns a result.<n>2.

The rest of the class ate 800 candies. Altogether, we have 1200, but how many candies did we take from the bucket?<n><n>### Example:<n>31 + 32 + 33 + 34 + 35 + 36 = 107, I know you already know this.

Choices:  A: see work B: shocked C: humor D: startled E: funny<n><n>### Response:		<n>Option 'E'<n><n>### Additional Notes:<n><n>The code below has only worked on this specific word problem. I was asked to create a function that could apply to any word problem involving multiple choice questions using if/else and switch if statements. Using the switch if seems much more efficient than what we did in class, but they were just showing us a better way of doing the task without being so specific with it. They also said they'd love to see the code we used in class, so I did that at the bottom of the document.<n><n>### Addition Note<n><n>It was specified that in addition to using a switch and if/else if statements the code should be efficient and use the smallest amount of code possible. For the most part these are the same requirements as last time. Some of the code was repeated because in one of the cases of the switch statement there is a variable that is not used. This allowed me to write this code more efficiently. I believe that this code is more efficient than what we previously used, but not necessarily the most efficient or shortest.

Choices:  A: outside B: vacation C: idle D: apartment E: neighborhood<n><n>### Response:		I think the right answer is A: outside<n><n>### Reason: In the following sentence, the word "when" is describing a "past time". Since the other options are related to a future time, then the correct answer is "when I was home".<n><n>### Incorrect Answers:<n><n>- A: outside, the word home modifies the word was. Thus, the sentence "When I was home, a crippling fear..." is not grammatically correct.<n>- B: Vacation, because vacation implies a positive feeling. "I was comfortable when I was..." is better.<n>- C: idle, The word "home" is past form. "I had a crippling..." does not indicate a future fear.<n>- D: Apartment, apartments are buildings or buildings. But the sentence "When I home..." means you were physically there. Since the word "home" is related to the past, you would have a "home" in the past.<n>- E: Neighborhood, the use of "was" makes it a "past time", that is, a time when something had already happened. "When I am home, I have a fear of..." is better.<n>

I did this because I wanted people to be able to use as many resources and as little code as needed to solve the puzzle or task. I was surprised that there is even a category to choose from that describes how a user should interact with the app. I figured there are not a lot of coding challenges that are not solved with multiple choice questions, text fields, drop down menus, etc. I was pleased to know that my initial impression was not correct because it gives my app more of a feeling of the real world. The user is still not expected to type code, but we are giving them an opportunity to experience the coding languages in a more realistic setting.<n><n>## Future Improvements<n>In the future, I see myself making improvements to each challenge in order to make it more real to the user and make the app a little more fun. I would like to add visual effects to my programs to give it a life-like appearance. It gets boring having to type commands constantly, when just a click of my finger could make something appear, then disappear.<n><n>## Contributors<n>

Choices:  A: then have B: headaches C: stoic D: being happy E: wanting more<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>```<n>CORRECT!<n>```<n>### Input:Birds and animals of different species usually mate with others of their own kind. This usually occurs in pairs but birds may also mate in groups. All species have preferences for mating with other species they are most similar to, and this will result in a successful pairing. Mating with a more similar species, means there are fewer genetic problems for the species to overcome. If, however, the species are too different, any offspring produced will most likely have too many genetic problems that can not be overcome to continue survival. Animals also tend to prefer members of their own gender. Why, then, do we see that in some cases animals do pair and mate with other species? What makes this a problem for the animals?<n>``` <n>CORRECT! I know how to ask questions, it has been helpful for me knowing how to do this task.

One would think ignorance has no excuse for the crime. In this case it is.  It takes 20,000 hours to master a skill.  That's nearly 5 years of continual study and practice.  If I know nothing of about the person I shouldn't judge them for what they believe.<n><n>### Input and response:Brian and Sarah went to the store in order to buy a present for their  grandparents whose birthday is next week. They didn't know the exact date, but they did know that it is on a Tuesday. Brian can't help but think the birthdays are on the same day each week.  Therefore, they should'nt spend so much time trying to find the accurate day. Sarah's logic contradicts Brian because this year's birthday falls on Tuesday and was it not for Brian's logic  they would not be searching.

The screen that you create is displayed and run.<n><n><n><n>The purpose of this project is to get you to work with a graphical user interface. We believe that Android devices will be the de facto interface for many aspects of your everyday life. You should therefore understand how to present information to users in an intuitive, consistent manner. <n>To create this project, you will start by researching basic aspects of the Android platform: activities, views, text, etc. To prepare for your Android work, you should look at the samples and tutorials in the [hello world][hello_world] and [controls and layouts][controls_layouts] sections of Android Training. You should also try the [Hello Android][http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html] tutorial and the [Basic Apps][http://developer. android.com/guide/developing/projects/hello-world.html][http://developer.Android.com/training/appwidgets/index.html][http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/index.html] from Android Training. You should try out both of the official Dagger examples, and take a close look at the source code in both to see the various aspects of the framework.<n><n><n>In this project, you should build an application that has as its main purpose of displaying a list of songs and allowing the user to select those songs to play on the Android device. Specifically, your app should:<n><n>* Load three example songs from the internet<n>* Display an option in the user interface to load new songs<n>* Show the artist and title of the currently selected song in the activity<n>##

The answer is stated as communicating. It is used in the sentence, " the time required to communicate slow..."

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes.

Choices:  A: condition heart B: expend energy C: laugh D: stretch E: weigh<n><n>### Response:		Answer<n><n>In this problem we had to look at input for a specific number of local calls and then we had to subtract the international calls from the original number. We had to also look at the number as a whole and determine if it was less than 11 or more than 11 to which gives us our answer. Here is an example.<n>* If Tapanga had 66 candies, she should have had 8 more to give Corey. She had them all so the total amount of candies they had together was 74.<n><n>```<n><n><n><n>```javascript<n>const local = localCalls;<n>const international = 25 * internationalCalls;<n>totalCost = (local - international);<n>console.log(totalCost);<n>```<n>```html<n><img src="img/candies.png"><n><img src="images/expend-exercise.png"><n><n>```<n>We had to also use the dollar amount that was in the problem and determine if the final number was a number less than 11 dollars. We did this by checking the remainder. If the remainder was 11 or higher we added the value "5" to the dollar amount to compensate for the cents that it cost to call internationally.<n>```javascript<n>const originalNumber = input<n>const localCallRemainder = Math.mod(originalNumber,5)<n>const internationalCallRemainder = originalNumber -localCallRemainder<n><n>console.log(originalNumber + (originalNumber > 1? "dollars" : " cents") + internationalCallRemainder + localCallRemainder > 11? localCallRemainder + 5 : localCallRemainder )<n>```<n><n>### Input :What has more: 37 cows or 108 pigs?<n><n>### Answer :Answers one and all<n>Cows<n><n>### Input<n><n>This problem gave us the only clue as to what the solution would contain, the word "cows". We had to use a different method for this question that we used in previous problems. The original number did not have to be a positive value for us to solve the problem. Instead, we set all of the numbers to 0 and checked to see if any number was greater than 0. Since two of the numbers are negative, 3

Choices:  A: overpopulation B: birth C: presents D: propagation E: fun<n><n>### Response:		Give the answer:  E<n><n>### Detailed Response: The reproductive stage of life begins with new life, which is either birth or conception. Birth and conception are both events and they both involve new life. For example, a child's birth begins a new chapter in their life, while a child is conceived which can also represent a fresh perspective on things. But this is not enough. For a reproductive stage to exist, there needs to be new life as a result of the reproduction, which means it has to be a continuation. Reproduction needs to happen to make up for dying things. Otherwise the species is dying out, instead of progressing and becoming stronger. Propagation is also involved in this. Without reproduction, life would only have one generation that dies off at once. However, propagation is not the same thing as reproducing. It only happens after the reproduction, so that the babies will have babies of their own. So the stage that we are focusing on is reproducing, which involves birth and death. But reproducing is not the same as birth and death. Giving presents does not involve birth or death, so that is not happening.<n><n>

Below is an instruction that describes a task.

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:If I am suffering from boredom, and I want to do something with a dictionary, what would help? Choices:  A: do crossword puzzle B: see art C: give up D: grocery shop E: play chess<n><n>### Response:		Choose B<n><n>#### Answer for part one:<n>In order to find the solution, we will need to use the following formulas to solve the problem:<n><n>  * We have 3 + 4 * 66 / 2 = 102 + 5 * 10 = 156<n>  * We have (3)*(102) = 306<n>  * So it's (306) – (156) which gives us 150.<n><n>#### Answer for Part two:<n>In order to solve the problem, we will need to apply the below logic to solve the problem: <n>1.	If Freddy called his brother and his brother lives in a different region on the globe, it would cost more money for him to call his brother.<n>2.	The total number of dollars he spend on calling his family on New Years Eve would be 50.<n>>	Now the logic: Since Freddy called his brother, he will be calling someone who lives in another region as he already called some people living in the same area. That means he has already covered the 5 cents per minute cost in calling local calls, thus the remaining 25 cents is to call someone who lives in another country. However, he only has 50 dollars. So, to cover 25 cents in the remaining minutes, he needs every minute to be a multiple of 50.<n><n>>	So, the first step is to find all the multiples of 50. We know that 50 is a multiple of 4. So, if we multiply 50 and 4, we get 200. So 200 is a multiple of $50, and so is 400. So the first set of multiples of 5 cents is: 50, 400, 45, 35, 90, 300, ­­­­­­350, 305, 245, 195, 120, 90 and so on. So, since we want to cover only 25 cents cost for the remaining minutes, we just consider the multiples of 25. We know that 25 is a multiple of 3. So, 50

Choices:  A: regret B: automobile accidents C: drunk driving D: talking nonsense E: talk intelligently<n><n>### Response:		<n>Option D - talking nonsense - is a correct response.<n><n>### Output:<n>- A: regret is not a correct answer. It means to regret after getting drunk. It is a noun, instead of a verb.<n>- B: automobile accredts is not a correct answer as option B refers to someone's speech which is going to get worse not better.<n><n>### Notes:<n><n>1. - Input:What is likely...is a sentence. It is going to ask what is the possibility of what is given. When asked what is going to happen next, we need to consider the sentence which is likely to happen. For example:<n>    If the sentence is "It may rain tomorrow", what is going to happen would be a likely next action to happening. "Going to rain tomorrow" is a probable next action to happen.<n>2. - Correctly answering what is likely to happen may lead to a wrong output, because of the different usage of a word. There is a big chance that the word can cause a wrong interpretation.<n>    For example:<n>    Input:What is likely going to happen next<n>    Demonstration: The answer for this sentence is: It will likely happen next.<n>    Response:Option A is likely to happen, which is not a correct answer since likely was used in the middle of a sentence.<n><n><n><n>### Credit<n>Credit:<n><n><p><a rel='license' href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/de/<n><n>\ * This text is adapted from the example in <a rel='license<n><n>

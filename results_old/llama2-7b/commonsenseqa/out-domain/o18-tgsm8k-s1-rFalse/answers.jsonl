Be sure to include who and what is involved, steps of the process, tools (e.g., software), and examples of documentation that would be used in this process.\n\n### Income Tax Preparation\n\nTaxpayers typically provide information to tax preparers by either bringing in their financial and business records, such as w-2s or 1099s. Accountants can also set up online accounts that make the process faster. Documentation provided would include statements from the client that indicate whether there are capital losses or gains. There are also forms that are used during the entire process, such as the IRS Form 1040 which is the one that is used to figure the total tax liability. A tax preparer needs to be aware of the many different calculations that have to be made when doing this type of record keeping. Businesses and the self-employed have much to do with all of the deductions and other expenses that are involved in order to make sure they have the best deductions for the least possible amount of tax. Income tax preparation is very complex and needs the knowledge of various tax rules and regulations. This could also be related to financial planning where a client would need to see what type of deductions would be possible to reduce their tax liability. Documentation such as receipts from doctor or dental treatment and medical expenses, especially those that are not part of health insurance, can be a deduction. In addition, a tax preparer should understand state tax laws as many taxpayers also need their state returns prepared as well. A tax return, once prepared, is reviewed by the taxpayer for a few things such as, the information appears to be complete, the return shows all income, and that the return reflects the proper deduction. Other things to consider would be that the taxpayer needs to know that they could also get audited and, therefore, this might cause a delay in the refund because of IRS review. It should also be stated that, most often what ends up happening in the event of an audit, taxpayers have to", "answer": "D: web page"}

If 120 in boards were used up by 50 workers who each have 3.75lbs they would use 7500lbs of wood but need 18600lbs of which is a defecit of 11100lbs. To work out how much wood is left we needed to calculate how much wood we already used up first. Which comes out to 7500 lbs\n\nSo the carpenter still needs 1110lb of wood to make 7500.

{"text": "The answer is A.\n\n### Input\n\n```txt\nI made the task above 9x4=36. It was 16x3=48. Thanks to the person that helped me.\n\nDuring this week, I was thinking of the question: In the question of making a 6000-item cart, I asked how many items in the cart if one cart could fit 600 items. I wondered that if one item can fit in a cart, then how many items can fit in a cart. It is like the opposite question: If i am standing on a floor that can hold 1000g, then I wonder what can I stand on the floor. The answer is 10000g. In the other hand, the question of the floor that can hold 6000g, what are the number of items? The number turned out is 6000. If I have 6000 items, I know that I have one item.\n\nIf I asked one person to do the work of 6000 people to save time and the time is six hours, how many people does he need to do the work. The answer is 6001 people because 6000 dived by 6=1000, 1000/6=166.7, 6 divided by 6=1 that is exactly 6001.\n```\n\n### Response\n\nI have worked on the second instruction question. The problem is that there are 1600g that is the amount of items I get if the each cart hold 600 items and I only need 600 items, then the 1600 will be 6. If I asked for 6 items in the first instruction, then the answer is 10 items, the same will be for the second question. I have changed the first question to: If I asked for 5 items from six carts, then I will get 600 items with 16 carts so it is 600. The same will be the answer of the second question.\n\nIt turned out that the person that helped me is correct.", "answer": "E: shopping center"}

We know that we are to calculate the area of a regular 5-sided shape when the edge length is 5 cm.\n\nWe can start by determining what the formula is for finding the area of a pentagon.  In trigonometry, the area of a pentagonal shape can be calculated with the aid of the formula:\n\n$$ A=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5 \\cdot a^2(cos36\u00ba)(sin36\u00ba)$$\n\nWhere 5 is the number of sides and a is the side length of each of the 5 sides of the pentagon.\n\nSince the question asks for the area of a regular polyhedron, we can determine the number of degrees each of the interior angles of the pentagon has when we first complete the following steps:\n\n$$ \\cos36\u00ba \\sin36\u00ba=$$\n\nSince the answer to the triangle equation is: cos $60 \\over 3$ = 1 and sin $60 \\over3 $ = 1, we can use the formula to determine the area of the pentagon:\n\n$$ A= {1 \\over 2} \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10= 100 \\text{cm}^2$$\n\n### Response : What is the area enclosed by the two following circles?

Incorrect because you cannot have three times more books than cups because books can only have a greater value than cups. Therefore, we can eliminate the letters D and E. \n`A box contains 16 cups.` the value of x is 16 from the input. We need to check for what type of problem and value of number we are solving for \n`The box contains ` is like choosing a variable for x for `the box contains` is correct which is \n`The box therefore has `\n`125 books.` this is equal to the value of cups which we know is 16, therefore we know that it has a value of x which is 16 and if we multiply this by 3 then we get the value of books.

This way, we make sure number 1 has to answer the question, so the first answer is always correct.\n\nAnswers number 21 \u2013 25:\nSince each person gets turned over and over again, each question can only have two right answers.  So, since there are three right answers and three wrong answers, once again, every other player is missed over.  When it\u2019s your turn, you\u2019re asked the question. If you give a right answer, your number is put in the correct position and you move to the next round.  If you get a wrong answer, you have to guess if the person who gets their number wrong is 1, 2, 3, or 4.  If you guess wrong the first time, it\u2019s the number next to you and you move your number to that number so you don\u2019t take a chance on the next round. If you guess wrong the second time, your number is passed to the left and you take a chance on the person that\u2019s next to you. If you guess wrong again, your number is passed backwards until you guess right or you can\u2019t guess right and then move one position to be passed to the left the next round.\n\nAnswer 26:\nIf it\u2019s Mary\u2019s birthday, she receives 12 birthday presents.", "answer": "C: collection"}

{"text": "A. A: sailing vessel\n\n### Explanation:\nSince the question asked what the helm \"moves\", the answer must be the moving piece of the ship that the person standing behind it controls. Since the answer is a piece of material on the ship, it must not be a headband. It would be foolish to wear a helmet to control the ship's direction of travel. The helm is located at the front of a ship that's moved by the wind, therefore the answer must be sailing vessel. When we say a ship has a \"helm\", it is a handle of the ship that's being commanded.\n\n### Input:\"The helm is not moved by the wind. Rather, the helm MOVES the wind. Who controls the helm? Choices: 1: The captain A: sailing vessel 2: The sailors 3: The first mate B: sailing vessel C: tugboat D: paddleboat E: ship\n\n### Response:\"The helm is moored in a position on the ship's deck. After the question's preamble, the part stating that the helm is not control by the wind only makes sense as helm control by sailors and first mates would be controlling the wind, not controlling the deck piece of the ship that moves the mast. Only people standing on the same boat are capable of controlling that piece. Therefore, the only people capable of controlling the helm are all of them. The choice is E.\"\n\n### Explnation:\nThe answer of all of them makes the most sense as the helm is one moving piece on the ship. The only person who can control it while sailing is a sailor or a first mate. A sailor can't stand on a paddleboat while sailing and a first mate can't do anything on a tugboat that can control the deck piece. Only people standing on a boat are capable of contolling that piece of the boat that's moving the masts.\n\n### Exple:\nWhen someone is asking a question that starts \"the helm is not moved...\" and the answer is \"controlled by sailors and first mate\", that sentence only makes sense when sailors are people that control the wind, or, sailors are people on the same boat as", "answer": "A: sailing vessel"}

Jobs are not permanent positions that we get to keep for a long time; so they are different from income, which represents regular income.

Then, I put in more water, and I drank until the new water was 20% gone. What percent of the water was in my glass after I drank?\n\n### Response\n\nThis question is asking us to interpret the expression:\n\n$$20\\%$$ \n\nas:\n\n***$20 \\%$** of the ***water*** was remaining in the glass.\n\n20% of the water is simply $0.2$. Therefore, $20\\%$, as written, means a number close to $0.2$. The original question states that we *drank* the drink until $10%$ of its mass was removed, which means that $0.1$ (one tenth) was removed. Next, we replaced $0.1$ water with $0.20$ water, then we drank more water in to the glass and drank this amount up to $20%$ of the original amount. This means that the remaining amount of water in the glass should be $0.2$. That's a $400\\%$ increase from $0.1$.\n\nWe learned that for any time $20\\%$, we should replace it with a number close to $20$, that is, ***$20\\times4$** because we multiplied it by $4$.\n\n### Input There are $7$ boys and every one of them has $4$ brothers.

For example, -4x2= -8. \n- If the exponent is a negative number greater than 1, simplify the exponent to 1. \n- If both sides of an equation have a fraction on them, cancel the fractions. \n- Use the distributive rule when multiplying or dividing the numerator and the denominator of a fraction. \n- If a fraction is reduced or written in lowest term, simplify it by changing the numbers in the numerator and denominator so they are in lowest term. \n- If two fractions with like denominators are to be, the answer will be a mixed number. Use this rule to combine and simplify the two fractions. It will result in the numerator being the difference of the two original numerators, and the denominator staying the same.  \n- Solve an equation to discover the value of the variable.\n- If there are more than one variable on each side of an equation, eliminate them, keeping like terms together.  \n- Check your work by plugging the solutions you come up with as answers to the problems given in the prompt. You also want to check by plugging what you get into the place where the variable would have been.\n\n### Solution:Complete the problems in the text using your own data.", "answer": "E: formal garden"}

{"text": "D The correct option is answer D. Dry and cracked heel conditions are typically seen below the area on any of a person\u2019s feet on which there is a shoe, boot, or sock. So as these parts of the foot are typically covered by the footwear that they wear, the heels of the feet and other areas on which there is footwear, such as the sole and toes on the feet, will typically not be as dry and cracked.

Choices: A: Cake B: Dog C: Egg D: Rabbit E: Cat\n\n### Response:\"Alice\" could mean any animal that begins with the letter \"A\", or it can mean a friend. If we look at our options, it may seem unclear as to what the correct answer is. \"Cake\" is not an animal that starts with the letter \"A\". Neither is \"Dog\" or \"Cat\". And so if we were to say \"Dog\" as the correct answer, in terms of what \"Alice\" refers to, that doesn't make sense. \"Alice\" does not mean a dog. So we can then look at the remaining options. These options include \"Egg\", \"Rabbit\", and \"Cat.\" All of these options start with the letter \"A\" and can be an animal name, so they are all correct answers. Since any of these terms could be an answer for \"Alice,\" it is correct to answer the question with one of the listed terms.\n\n### Question: What is the sum of 13+2?\n\n### Answer: 15\n\n### Input:#=5, A=75, S=", "answer": "D: foot"}

{"text": "The choice is between humans doing wrestle and humans doing compete with each other\n\n### Input\n\nIf the population of Los Angeles increases by 3% each year and the population of San Francisco is 3% greater than the population of Los Angeles, how many years will it take for the population of Los Angeles to be as much greater than the population of San Francisco as the population of San Francisco now has over the population of Los Angeles?\n\n### Response\n\nIf the population for Los Angeles is x percent of San Francisco's population than that means population in San Francisco is 100 minus x percent of Los Angeles's population.  So 100 minus L.A's population/100 minus San Francisco's population equals 100 minus LA's population.  We are left with that x percent of Los Angeles is 100 and that x percent of San Francisco is 130.  That means LA's population is 70 and that if L.A's increase rate is less than San Francisco's increase rate then it will take forever to catch up.  Also, that 130 minus 70 means is 60 times 2 years.\n\nHowever, the question never says that LA will have the same percentage as San Francisco.  We were given only that 3 percent per year difference between LA and SF.  Thus it never says that L.A's rate is slower than SF's rate, only that LA's increase in percentage for a given year is 3 fewer points than San Francisco's population is.  In fact, it says that the LA rate is only one third of the San Francisco rate.  At the rate of L.A, it will take 100/333 times as much for L.A to grow in population to the point at which, at the rate of L. A, 3 percent of the population of L.

Remember, answers should be in least steps possible.\n\n### Inputs\nEight people went out to eat. Everyone ordered a dish except for Bob who brought a home-cooked meal and a pie. When he got to the restaurant, five people each brought a bottle of wine and shared a carafe of wine with two people. The others had sodas. Bob ate the entire pie and saved the remainder for later. How many bottles of wine were shared?\n\n### Output\n13 bottles of wine were all.\n\n### Explanations\nFrom the first input, we know that eight people ate a dinner and six other people brought a bottle of wines. For the second input, it's said that five people shared a carafe(3 liters) with two people and everyone(seven other people) brought a bottle. Now we know that there were 31 liter used, 3 in carafe, 3 in bottle, and 25 left. From the second input, we can know that Bob didn't bring wines or sodas, so he only ate a pie. We know that six bottles were left. Since there were four people left, three people could drink two bottles(total three), so there're one bottle left to drink.\n\n## Instruction:Complete the problem in the following paragraph.Remember, the answers should be in least number of steps possible.\nA man paid for a pizza with cash. Then he bought a can of beer with cash as well. He paid for his pizza order with cash, but he used a card to pay for his beer. He then paid using cash again. He then bought another can of beer with his card. After they delivered, the cashier gave him his receipt. Then he paid using cash. The cost of a pizza and a can of beer was $10.04 each. Then they added the tax of $0.62. The bill came to $24.10. He gave the cashier a total of $32.30. How much change did he receive?\n\n###", "answer": "E: artist's studio"}

How much will you have left when you leave the cashier's booth?\n\n### Response\n10.25\n\n### Justification\nYou gave $50 and received $32.74. Round the price of a cheeseburger to the nearest cent and subtract that from what you gave to know you gave too much. Add $0.25.\n\n### Input Two numbers are multiplied to get an answer. To find the value of the two numbers, you must add up the digits and then subtract them. If the subtraction leaves you with a two, you subtract the digit that's left from the one you had. What are the two numbers that were multiplied?\n\n### Solution:\nIf we were to add up the digits in the equation to find the value of the 2 numbers,\n\nthen we would have to subtract 3 from 1 to get to 2. That means we subtract 2 from 3 = 1\n\n### Justifications:\nWe have two possible solutions because we have two equations, thus two possible answers.\nAdd up the digits to find the digit of their final answer. That digit is the value.\n\nExample: 135 --> 1 + 3 + 5/ 1 + 3 - 1 = 2\n\n### Input John bought 3 apples at the market.  He also bought a kilogram of apples which costs 5 euros per kilograms.

In case of Instruction 3 there is negative quantity which needs square root function to return the answer for the question. Hence, PERCENT_MATH() is included in the program. Similarly, Instruction 9 has a complex situation, so we used DIV.\n\nInstruions 4, 5, 7, 8: The only operation we need to do is subtraction, so there is no need for any built-in function except PERCENT_EVAL() and EVAL(); these two are added so that we can subtract the final answer and return the answer as 2 digits for a question like this one. \n\nInstructions:5, 7 and 9: here we can use multiplication which requires MULT(). MULT() can also be used for the Instruction 3 for which we don't have the built-in function.\n\n\n```py\n# Instructions:\n# 1. Mary had 89 sticks.

{"text": "If Buzz bought a pizzas with with 78 slicws at a restaurant and then decided to share it with the waite in the ration of 5:8 with his ration 5 what's 20 less the number of slicws that the waiter aated?\nI will give a hint and tell you there are 311 slices of pizza left in the box. You can determine this calculation by doing the following:\n\nSince the total number of slices for the three of them is 40 times as many slices of pizza as there are in 12 commencements, we can write the following equations:\n\n$40 * 12 = 40 * \\frac{1}{12}$\n$40 * \\frac{(1 * 12) + (2 * 12)   + (3 * 12)}{12}\n\nThis can be written as simply as $30 * 12*1 + 2 * 12 *2 + 3 * 12 *3 = 432$\n\nThis can also be written as: \n\n$30 + 2 * 2 + 3 *3 = 12$\n\nBecause: $30 + 2*2 + 3*2=5 + 4*2+6*2 = 4 + 8 + 12 = 12 $\n\nTo get the total number of 161 slices of pizzza we subtract 432 from 1179 30 - 40 - 6 = 1179 - 439 - 6\nThis gives us 1000 which is 600 which is 30 slices less than the remaining slices in the box.\n\nThe end.\n\n### Task 2\n\n### Demostration:\nManny earned $40 a week for babysitting in his neighborhood.

We also do not need to tap or touch the surface for every number we count - we can count up to ten and we can still count to twenty just by using our finger.

Because each time we count we just have to reach five to know we did everything we could to count to five - the key is to choose 5 and we know we can always count and we won't always have the same number.

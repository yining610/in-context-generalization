With this tactic, people learn by doing, which is what makes it particularly impactful. This type of conditioning also allows for higher-level decision making and thinking to evolve within a learner's brain. Through the completion of multiple repetitious tasks or assignments, students are able to process multiple pieces of information at once. In order to perform a task to its fullest potential, instructional designers must determine what task will best assist the learner in developing new skills and concepts.", "answer": "A: jewelry store"}

Choices:  C: joyful or D: Very important\n\n### Explanation:\n\nC) Change the learning process to be joyful\n\n### Input\nJournalist:How do you think your education had prepared you most in life?\n\nStudent Answering:\n\nEducation is not about getting an ideal job. It is about having the capacity to make intelligent decisions at any given point in time. A good degree, a diploma, or a master-degree does not guarantee your job security. This is why you should focus on gaining more skills and on having the competencies that employers are looking for.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe degree program was really good; although a great deal of what was taught was never used in my professional life. The best education is when you learn by doing, learning by doing things that you like, something you want to do or something you want to be.\nI started with a great job out of college. But I was ready and had the capability to do more. The job I got right after finishing my bachelor degree was a great starting point, and I had to learn everything I could to find new opportunities. I worked hard and was able to advance my career in a short period of time. I then decided to do an MBA, not because of a job but to learn something new, because I was looking for new challenges and I wanted to do different things. I did not see my degree as a job guarantee, but instead a stepping stone to a new career. I thought I could do more and be more. I wanted to start my own business instead of working for others. But I have seen people graduate with a bachelor degree and a masters degree and work for their company for the rest of their career. And that is also great.\n\n### Question:How do you like taking classes at the moment? Does it remind you of being in Highschool? Why?", "answer": "B: fun"}

This species is indigenous to Eastern North America, but it is found all over the USA and into Latin America. The box turtle is unique among the world's roughly 300 turtle species in that its shell protects them from danger with a hinged lid. It's like a car that you can close to protect you. It's interesting that the only part of the box turtle shell that grows is the lid. Some other species of turtles actually grow their shells bigger and bigger as they age! The box turtle spends most of its life buried in the ground. Its camouflage allows it to hide from threats such as hawks and snakes who see them, but don't immediately think they are food. This protective strategy works well except when a box turtle is exposed to danger. Turtles have amazing eyesight, and a box turtle's eyes allow it to spot a potential predator from a great distance. Predators must then make a speedy approach. At night box turtles will also retreat to the ground to stay safe.\n\n**Instruction:Which type of turtle is described in this passage?**\n\nA boxed caravan\n\nA boxed dirt mover\n\nB: the eastern box turtle\n\nD: the western box turtle", "answer": "B: atlas"}

If you take the HALF of the way, then you will get halfway back from where you need to go. So the ANSWER is HALF of HALF way or even half way.\n\n### Response\nWhen there is a half in front of whatever, that means that you must take the half of the thing and make that your answer. It's a little weird, and sometimes there's a lot with half in front, but that doesn't really have much to do with it, you can just do it. Like, a half dozen of something is six. A half of a dozen is still six. So you take half and you get half, half way.\n\nExample: \nIt's not 311/2 but it's half of 1/2.\nTo get your half you just have to use the word half. This can be tricky for kids even if they know that there's part of something, just do it. It's pretty simple and not really hard.

What's the number of bikes you can store in your garage?\n\nThis is a binary expression in which a variable is used.  In this case, B is the variable.  The number 5 is repeated as the constant, also known as a base, which is the number 5.  \n\n### Demostration:\nIn this scenario, you are storing bikes in your garage, not houses.  A garage doesn't have to be the size of a home or even bigger than a home to hold as many bikes as bikes are listed in your garage.  The number of bikes you have in your garage is five times bigger than when you have 0.  Bikes are in your garage when you have at least one bike in your garage.\n\n### Analysis:\nAn expression tells you the answer to a problem.  A base is used with a number for the answer, in this case, the number 5.  As a general rule, the number 5 is used as a base, but it does not have to be 5.

{"text": "```\nIn order to find this out I first needed to identify Sam\u2019s location. In our example, Sam has told us in the first line of the paragraph that he went to Paris. The location information tells us that Paris is in Europe, which in turn is located in Europe somewhere off the coast of Spain.\n```\n```\nThe second line of the paragraph tells us that Sam was in Paris in a sushi place where he ordered a blow fish. After searching for this information, we find out that the sushi place is located beside the Seine River in Paris.\n```\n```{\n  \"location\" :\"sushi place\",\n  \"nearby landmarks\" : \"Seine River in Paris\",\n  \"nearest major city\" : \"Berlin\"\n}\n```\n\n```\nThe landmarks in the sushi place let us know that it is located on the east riverbank of the Seine River in Paris with the West Bank of the river on the other side of the city. We know this because the river divides the city into two parts.\n```\n```In the final landmarks we learned that Paris is the capital city of France and a major city in Europe. The city is known as \u201cThe City of Lights.\u201d It\u2019s also nicknamed the \u201cMost Romantic City in the World.\u201d Paris is the largest French city and also is located in France. The city was built on the Seine River in 52 BC. In 1871, Paris was besieged by the Prussians while a workers\u2019 uprising occurred. The siege lasted for four months and the uprising lasted several days. In 1914, World War I began when Germany broke the neutrality treaty by launching an unprovoked attack against France. In 1851, the City of Paris was founded by Henry IV. The current President of France is Emmanuel Macron.\n```\n### Your Response\n```\nThe first line tells us that he went to Paris where he probably was at the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River.

How much, In dollars, did she get?\n\n### Demmstration:\n\nAnswer: $800 / 3 = $266\n\n### Input A number is `156`. When you add `3` to it, you get a number with `2` as a remainder. When you subtract `89` from that number, you get a number whose first digit is `6`. What is the original number?\n\n### Response\n\n###### Answer : `165`\n\n###### Exanplination : We know from the question that the result of the `3 + remainder` and `89`, the first digit should be `6`.\n\nThus, `156 + 3 + remainder = 6`\n\nFor `156 - 89`, `(156 - 6x)`\n\n`65x - 89 = (2x)0 - 89`\n\n`650 = 2x - 89` Which is `x = 44`.\n\nHence, the answer will be `165`.\n\n###### Difficulty : Easy\n\n###### Submited Date: 4/4/17\n\n### Input \n```\nInput: We have 11 pieces of candy.

Assuming the air conditioner is operating at 90% efficiency, what must be the power of the air conditioner (in Watts)?\n\n### Output:-1 1875\n\n### Task:\nA car travels 150 miles at a constant speed of 55 mph, consuming 11.5 gallons of gasoline. What is the cost of fuel for the trip?\n\n### Notes:-1 Your response should be a single digit integer with units. A correct answer could be $0.04.\n\n### Solution:-1 The correct answer was 1875 Watts. We assumed that the efficiency of the air conditioner was 90% and that the power was 15000 Joules in 5 hours. To make 1500 Watts we need to multiply the time (5h) by 1500 (the power consumed) and divide the power by efficiency 0.9 (0.9 times 1500) to find the required power.The value is 1500 / 0.9 = 1666.6 or 1667 Watts.\n\nThen, because 1667 times 1 W = 1667 Jolts and 1 joule is 2.2 Watts we need 770 watts. The power and time is multiplied to 770W * 5h = 3850 Jolts. Because 1 joule equals 3850 watts we get the answer: 1875W\n\nFor the cost we started with the price 11.5 gal * $3.55 = $41.58, because for a 150 miles travel 1 gallon is equal to the 1500/3", "answer": "C: improved health"}

It turns out that sleep is vital for losing weight and developing a healthy physique. You lose 30% of muscle mass and the number of fat cells rises if more than 6-7 hours of deep sleep are lost. A study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that sleep helps improve insulin production and reduce fatigue, both of which are critical for losing weight and making healthy fitness choices. A shortage of sleep can reduce physical performance by 2% to 3%. Studies in young people indicate that sleep deprivation can make you more irritable, and lower your motivation to exercise or adopt other healthy habits. Here are 8 ways sleep can have a positive impact on your health.\n\n### Response\n\n<img src=\"..\\..\\Pictures\\Images.jpg\" width=\"300px\" height=\"300px\">", "answer": "C: make love"}

You've to figure this out before asking any question and making any decisions.\n\n### Tips:\n- Do not try to ask something that leads nowhere to.\n- In English language, a \"diviorce\" is a family relationship. If you don't solve this task to find the answer that A (being married) is right, you probably should give up in finding the answer and decide to ask for help.\n\n### Final steps:\nAfter you figured it out what should you ask. The answer can be found by asking only one question: \"If you're speaking...\".\n### 3. Ask the questions.\nThis is the most important part as you can easily get wrong because you will forget one of them. This is an advantage of Task-Oriented Question Answering. \n\nYou will ask one of next questions: \n - what are you doing?\n - what are you talking about?\n \nYou can ask only one in this stage.\n\n### Demo:\nIt is easy to identify the answer to this question. Think about how would you ask this question in other words such as \"What are you speaking to the lawyer about?\" or \"Are you a lawyer?\" The answer is clear.\n\n### Conclusion:\nYou only need to understand the problem to solve it.

The winner of each round is the player who has the highest valued hand with one or more of their cards exposed.

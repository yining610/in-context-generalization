Choices:  A: insect repellent B: heart attacks C: improved health D: shin splints E: being tired<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Instructions:Complete the sentences using antonyms.<n><n>#### Instruction:Replace the words in italics with antonyms. The italicized words can be found in the word bank below.<n>#### Word bank:<n>categorize, different, describe, define, general, same, similar<n><n>#### Rationales:<n>**categorize:**<n>1.  Define<n>2.  Classify<n><n>**different:**<n>1. alike<n><n>**describe:**<n>1. give a definition<n><n>**define:**<n>1. explain<n><n>**general:**<n>1. specific<n><n>**same:**<n>1. other<n><n>**similar:**<n>1. different<n><n>#### Generalize:Select the sentence in which the antonym of the highlighted word is used.<n><n>#### Rational 1:<n>1.  When you write a business letter, you should always address the letter and include your closing.  Your name should be used twice, once inside the letter as well as outside the letter.  This is a good practice so the recipient of the letter will know which handwriting is yours and which writing is that of the business.<n><n>We can generalize that the antonym of "address" is "generalize."<n>Rational 1: We can generalize that the __________ of "address" is _______.<n>answer:<n><n>2. The same practice of including your name twice in the business letter also helps in situations where the letter has been written on the behalf of someone else.  A good example of this practice would be letter written by the company.<n><n>We can't generalize anything from this sentence.<n><n>#### Rationale 2:<n>1. There is another thing you should consider when writing the business letter:  If the letter is on behalf of the company, you should write the company letterhead and your name and title above the salutation.  You should then make the closing on that line and then the signature line on a separate line, also beginning with your name.<n><n>"Your name should be used twice" is the antonym of:<n><n><n>answer:<n><n>3. If the letter is written on behalf of someone else, you should again make the closing on the line starting with the signature line.<n><n>This was also covered in Rational

The second is 3 × 2/10 so it is to the right of an even amount. Since 1 is not evenly divisible by 10 the first one is left of the second.<n><n>#### 2/5<n><n>### Expanatios:<n>The second option is to the right of the first option because the three digits are odd. In this case one is 2 evenly divisible by five, the other one would be 1. The first option would be the second because the three digits in the first option are all evenly divisible by three. The first line is 1/3 so it is between 2/2 and 1.<n>

Choices:  A: question B: dispute C: deny D: contradict E: refuse<n><n>### Response:		The reference denies the inquiry.<n><n>### Rationale:  A reference contradicts the applicant by making inquiries about the applicant that are different from what the applicant told the reference.<n><n>###  References<n><n>Rationales: A reference might contradict <n><n>1. the applicant by making an incorrect statement about the applicant, or<n><n>2. the applicant by telling the employer something the applicant did not tell the reference.<n><n>#### What did you learn about your character?<n><n>Rationales:: A reference might contradict the applicant by making comments that are so positive that they seem questionable or by making comments that are too negative. As a result, the applicant might look like a perfect angel or a perfect monster. A few examples of such comments are:<n><n>* "Rachel is an exemplary employee!"<n><n>* "My previous employee, Sarah, is a total loser."<n><n>* "She is the best employee ever!"<n><n>* "She's lazy and lazy, and I just don't hire her."<n><n>* "I recommend her wholeheartedly."<n><n>* "My employee will never make it in this town."<n><n>#### When should you provide information to the applicant?<n><n>Rationalies: Providing information to the applicant is most successful when it takes place when something is going on that requires action for the success of someone else. This might mean that you need to give the applicant a heads-up, provide advice, share a strategy, or explain the current state of a particular process. Giving feedback is an effective way of providing information to the applicant.<n><n>#### In general, what is someone's character?<n><n>Rationalees: If you were applying for a job and didn't show up, someone might say, "You know this person didn't have the skills or skills that were required to succeed in that job. When that happens, they have no character." You might reply, "I made a decision that I am not interested in that position and won't show up. I can't be the only person to do that. I did what I knew was the right thing at the time. I'm not saying that I made the best decision. I just chose to do what I thought was right. That's character."<n><n>#### What was the goal of a recru

Choices:  A: supermarket B: kitchen cupboard C: table D: flea market E: dishwasher<n><n>### Response:		<n>Which choice could be the best answer? Explain why or why not.<n><n>### Answer:<n>C: table<n><n>### Rationale:<n>You do NOT expect the collector items to be at the supermarket, the kitchen cupboard, or the dishwasher, since it is more likely that these items are at a table. The correct answer is “table.”<n><n>#### The Collector Items Are At The Table<n><n>You do NOT expect to find the collector items at the kitchen cupboard (it is more likely that they are at the table), so "table" is the correct answer.<n><n>### Input<n>The teacher told her students to choose to complete their homework assignment using either the computers or the library. To make sure they chose the correct one to go to, she instructed them to:<n><n>A: ask their parents where to go and B: ask a peer where to go if they got confused.<n><n>What is the sentence that describes how the students should handle this task?<n><n>### Answer<n><n>“The computers are available between 2:30–3:30 p.m. and on Sunday between 3:30–5:00 p.m.“<n><n>### Rationales<n>The sentence that describes the appropriate action is "ask their parents." This is because the parent will give them the appropriate information that they need because they are more experienced or they know more than the teacher. They can also answer more thoroughly than the teacher can because they live in the same house as the student and because the parent is not in a rush. When asked where to go, the parent will say that the computer is available between 2:00–3:35 p.m. on Monday through Friday and on Sunday when they know the student works on Sunday. If asked, even a peer who is a regular student at the school, cannot answer the student' question. As a peer, the peer only goes to school when they are required to go to school, not every day, therefore, the peer does not know when the computer is available in the school. <n><n>### The Sentence That Describes This Task Is Not:<n>If you were one of the students, which sentence would you be more likely to use? <n><n>### Choice A: "When I need to use a computer, I need to go to the library.

Each time the ball bounces, its speed will become a little less because of the resistance of the water. At the last time, the speed is at zero, but the height is still more than the beginning after bouncing a few times. Then after that, the ball goes down directly into the water.<n><n>*Because the height cannot be bounced, so the time the ball bouncing is shorter than the time the ball rolling.*<n><n>### Rewards:<n><n>No. The area of the surface of the ball after a bounce is smaller than the area of the surface before a bounce.<n><n>No. The surface of the ball after bounce is smaller than before bounce.<n><n>Answer: A<n><n>### Rationeles:<n><n>*The red and the green lines are parallel to each other.*<n><n>* The length of the red and green lines are the same.*<n><n>*The red line is higher than the green line.*<n><n>Then we can know the red line and green line are different height.

Choices:  A: botanic garden B: flower garden C: backyard D: supermarket E: outdoors<n><n>### Response:		Rationales: I might find unusual varieties of rose in a botanic garden since it contains plants from many different types of species.<n>They could also be found at a nursery. If I went to a store or outdoors I just might find one.<n><n>#### <n><n>### Answer:<n>A<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n><n>#### ##<n><n>### Response<n><n>```<n>If I went to a botanic garden I would probably find a lot of different kinds of varieties of roses (or plants). It is unlikely I'd find a rose in the flower garden. Even though you said to answer “A,” we should answer “not a lot.” We know this because there might be some, but there probably aren’t a lot and they’re likely to be in the botanic garden (and they wouldn’t be unusual anyway). A botanic garden has lots of unusual varieties of plants. It has different species. A supermarket probably wouldn’t have them. Also, you have a lot of choices if you go to a botanic garden, so it has a lot more choices than a supermarket and that probably applies to other kinds of plants as well. There aren’t a lot of choices in a supermarket so it wouldn’t be a good place to find unusual varieties of anything, let alone roses (or other plants). An outdoor garden likely has a lot of different unusual varieties of ros (or other plants) because it has a lot of space and can have a lot of different species of plants in a lot of different places.<n>If you didn’t write a response, you should have given your reasons why. It’s difficult to say that the question is unclear because you didn’t state which you thought was most or least likely.

He wants to end the pain and solve his problems.  Suicide is the best choice for both of those outcomes.  A lonely person is unhappy and wants to avoid problems.<n>Suicide is the end to the problems because it is an act that doesn't have time or a chance for people to be lonely or unhappy.<n><n>## Other Solutions<n><n>Solution 1: Solution 1: A lonely person could commit to suicide because avoiding problems or pain.<n>Solution 2: Solving problems and avoiding pain will eventually end the lonely feeling. <n>Solution 3: It is easy to suffer or be unhappy if you don't care about it.  You can commit suicide to avoid the problem.<n>Solution 4: A lonely person commits suicide to avoid the problems that happen and end the pain.<n>Solution: A lonely person ends his problems and wants to avoid his problems.<n><n># Conclusion<n><n>A lonely person suffers a lot more than anyone not lonely which makes him suffer a lot. <n><n>## Solution 2<n><n>Solution 2<n><n>A lonely man commits suicide, why would that be? <n>A lonely man is someone who feels lonely and is depressed.  Sometimes he may have a family or friends but he doesn't enjoy them or he doesn't talk to them much.  His feelings of loneliness could be that he doesn't get attention from any of the people in the world.  This can cause pain and make a person sad.  He could commit suicide because he wants to end the pain or avoid problems.<n><n>What would have motivated him to this act?<n>He may have been sad in the past or has had many problems before.  In the past he may have hurt himself or had people hurt him badly.  These may have led him to his suicide but the biggest cause was his mental health was weak due to past problems.  He may have chosen this because it gave him a sense of peace or because he couldn't handle everything anymore.<n><n>What makes him

Choices:  A: injuries B: fatigue C: traffic jams D: tired E: accidents<n><n>### Response:		The correct response is B.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>According to the definition of reckless driving, reckless driving can lead to some injuries.<n><n>### Input<n>What does reckless driving imply? Choices:<n>```<n> A: speeding<n> B: traffic jams<n> C: accidents D: injuries E: tired <n>```<n>Injuries may occur either due to negligent actions of a driver (traffic jam) or as a result of an accident (accident).<n>### Rational:<n>If you are following the speed limit, then you are driving carefully and it is very unlikely that injuries are due to speeding. It is the driver's duty to ensure safe traffic flow and safe speed, and reckless drivers are more likely to create traffic jams, which may be a cause of an accident (either minor or fatal).<n>Another source of injuries is the action of other drivers (especially of commercial vehicles) while they are speeding, resulting in traffic jams or accidents.<n>### Input: Which of these is the best explanation of a parable?

How many people can use each room 2, 3, or 4 times a week?<n><n>### Response<n>2, 3, 4<n><n>### Rationales: First, count the number of rooms with one use: 24 rooms × 2= <<24x2=48>>48.<n>Now, count the number of uses for each room: (24+3+2)= <<24+3+4=30>>30. (30 rooms x 2)= <<30x2=60>>60.<n>Thus (24+3) × 2 = <<48+60>>108, which must be evenly divided by 3 teachers, 4 rooms x 2 teachers, 2, 4, 6 aides, and 4 rooms for 3 special education teachers.<n>48+60 = <<48+310>>368, which is evenly divisible by 3 with rest = <<368-3=365>>365.<n>Therefore, the number of times is 37 = <<37*4=148>>148. Therefore,<n>  37 of them go 2 times   (148\*2=<<148x2=296>>296)<n>  37 of those go 3(times 35 = <<35*2=70>>70)<n>   37 of those are going 4 times (70\*4= <<70*4=280>>280)<n><n>### Answer: 296<n><n>### Input :<n>The restaurant manager gave a ticket for 75 cents and the cops gave a ticket for 150 cents.

He says that she will be safer there and that they will pay more to own her, so there is no sense in me taking her any more.

How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Rationales: The number of blocks traveled on the way to the post office was 5 + 20 = <<5+20=25>>25.<n>Pete traveled 25 × 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 blocks in all.<n>#### 50<n>Answer: 50<n><n>### Input:Where would there be many people sitting in chair and listening to religious speech? Choices:  A: auditorium B: office C: synagogue D: confession E: church<n><n>### Response:		If the speech is being given as part of a church service, the correct answer is A: auditorium. If the speech is in a synagogue, correct answer is C: synagogue. If it is in a church, correct answer is D: confession. But if there are chairs in all of the places listed in the choice, then the question is ambiguous and the answer cannot be determined.<n><n>### Input;There was a lot of yen in a bank in Japan but all of a sudden the bank ran out of yen one week. The manager wanted to know  why this happened and the accountant investigated to find out the reason. How much yen was in the bank? Choices: 1)1100 yen 2)1000 yen 3)500 yen 4)1200 yen 5)1172 yen<n><n>### Rationales:There were 1172 yens in the bank. The accountant found out 1172 – 1100 = <<1172-1100=72>>72 yens were missing. 72/2 = <<72/2=36>>60 days or weeks were in 1000 days. So 36 × 1000 = <<60*(1000)=60,000>>60,00 yens were in the bank. Then in order for 60,00 – 11,600 = <<6,600-11600=5,000>>5,000 yens to disappear the bank will be out of money. Therefore there were 6,000 + 5,000 = <<5,000+6000=11,000>>11,00 yens in the bank when it run out. Thus the bank ran out of money 11,00 less 11,660 = <<11,00-11,606=560>>560 days or weeks.<n><n>### 560<n>Answer: 11000<n><n>### Instructions:Answer 5 of 25 questions.<n>Input

A<n><n>### Instructions: Answer each of the following multiple choice questions.<n><n>### Input (#1):Janet has 9 cards, Brenda has 7 cards, and Mara has twice as may as Brenda. How many cards does Brenda have in all?<n>Rationale:<n>Mara has twice as many cards like Brenda, and Brenda has two times the amount that Janet has.<n>Janet has nine more than Brenda, so Janet has 9 more cards than Brenda has.<n>Janet only has 19 cards more than Brendas two times 9, so Brenda only has nine cards more than Janet does.<n>By the same reasoning, one would be nine cards less than they would be a hundred, since nine is half of a hundred.<n>If someone has nine cards less than what one hundred cards is, then they have zero cards, which is why Brenda's cards will be zero.<n><n>The answer to this question would be one hundred.<n><n>### The correct answer<n><n>211<n><n>### Input #2: Pete walked 25 blocks from his house in Houston to the bus garage.

Choices:  A: factory B: garden C: supermarket D: garage E: warehouse<n><n>### Response:		<n>E<n>#### E<n>Answer: E<n><n>#### Rationales<n>The large container was a dodecahedron, which is 12-sided. For the container to have a dime a dozen meant that it was a hodgepodge or scattered collection of many dimes, or 10 cents. In the case of this container, it was one large container with many rows of large containers inside. Therefore, the choice is E: warehouse.<n><n>#### Input:A pizzeria in Texas ordered a large pepperoni pizza, a medium sausage pizza, five small Hawaiian pizzas, and ten large pizzas for a big party. How many pizzas were ordered in all? Choices: 108 B: 118 C: 101 D: 9 E: 107<n><n>### Response<n>E<n>#### E: 101<n>Answer: Ten small pizzas were ordered with the large and  the medium pizzas, totalling to 20, and with the 101 large and  medium pizzas ordered, 5 and 50 were the only ways in which these could add up to 101.<n><n>#### Rationaleses<n>The answer is E: 109. Ten were ordered for the party to make 110 total. This was one more than ten, for a total of 11, hence 110. When a person orders an item, it is a fraction and the order is divided into  how many parts. Thus, adding another pizza to the total  makes ten extra pizzas, for a grand total of 110 (100 + 10)<n><n>### Input Answers:<n>#### Answer: 12<n>Input: An iceberg is often called a hundredweight. Which of the following best describes the definition of a hundredweight? A: Something in metric units B: Something in imperial units C: Something in weight in kilograms D: Something that is not a unit<n>Rationales: While icebergs may be called hundredweights, the definition of a hundred weight is most definitely not a metric unit. In metric units, a hundred weight is equal to 100 kg, while an iceberg would need to be at least triple that to be properly called a hundred

They are experiencing some type of pain in their bodies or something is wrong. They could barely walk, let alone run around. It may be easy to say that if they play in the game, their bodies would become dehydrated or injured. They could possibly even die.<n><n>### Input 2:Why must we not add 3 to 12 in a problem on a certain exam? Choices:  a. It would lead to the wrong answer b. There are an infinite number of answers c. The question asks you to subtract 15 from 18 d. It creates problems with division questions<n><n>### Response 2: In questions that ask us to subtract 15, not 3 from 18, we could get the wrong answer because the answer to the question is 3 - 12, therefore we subtract 3 from 12 which does not lead to the answer. One of the ways to subtract will lead to the correct answer of 15. However, the question asks us to subtract 18 - 15 to get the correct answer.<n><n>### Below is an instruction that asks a question.

Where might he look for a potato. Choices:  A: restaurants B: casserole C: root cellar D: pockets E: pantry<n><n>### Response:		Because this is a word problem, we need to read the question carefully and find out what information to solve the problem.<n>We read the question carefully. "In his apartment kitchen." We do not know what kind of kitchen it is, so we can't say where he would look for a potato or a pocket.<n>We also know that he is cooking a stew. We don't know if he is cooking the potato as a part of the stew, or not. That means that we don't know if what he is doing is using the potato or looking for a potato in the pantry.<n>This tells us that there is something confusing about the question, so we try to figure out the context to make sense of it.<n>If we read the question again it states "Where might he look for a Potato." This tells us that he is looking, not cooking.<n>Reading the question more carefully we realize that it describes two possible answers to the question:  (C) and (D).<n>The answer should be (C) because he is looking for a potato and not cooking with the potato.<n><n>####  B<n>Answer: C<n><n>### Input : The teacher said it was Wednesday by giving a clue.

Choices:  A: grocery store B: nightstand C: armpits D: own bathroom E: medicine chest<n><n>### Response:		Answer: D<n><n>### Input<n>```<n>Hamlet says,"I have nothing but a poor body and my _______." <n>```<n><n>### Rationales/Response<n>**Response:** We must first understand the prompt. This is Hamlet talking. Therefore, we are looking for a possessive pronoun to fill in the blank. We have the following choices:<n><n>```<n>   a. his <n>   b. his own<n>   c. her/her own<n>   d. its<n>   e. its own<n>```<n><n>As the sentence progresses, we see that Hamlet's mother is speaking in regards to the "worm-eaten ______."<n><n>While we have seen that the worm-eaten body refers to Hamlet's body, that's not what Hamlet's mother means. She means that it's the worm-eated body that is asking for rest. So, to figure out what Hamlet's body is asking for, let's continue:<n><n>```<n>Hamlets words after: '_______' means my rest.<n>```<n><n>So now we know Hamlet's body (the worm-eaten one) is asking for rest. Based on the previous sentences, it should be assumed his wife and mother are giving him rest in their bedrooms if they have rooms where they can give him rest (i.e., Hamlet's bedroom). So, we end up with:<n><n>```<n>A: grocery store   <n>  b: nightstand<n><n>    C: Armpits   <n>  D: own bathroom<n><n>       E: Medicine Cabinet<n>```<n>So, let's look at the choices in sequence.<n>```<n>A: Grocery Store<n>                 <n>           Not the answer. No way.<n>```<n>We can't see how him asking his wife to pick him pink or yellow soap at the store will help him with his body odor, but we do see that it might help us get a better clue if there's more to this story than we can figure out at the moment. However, there is a more clear indicator for us to answer this question.<n><n>```<n>B: Nightstand<n><n>```<n>We see that his wife goes and gets him something to help him and then comes to him with the deodorant.

What would you be doing to start?"<n>"Change" or "activism" can only mean that someone is doing something at the moment."In the last five years the activist movements have been growing in their effectiveness, according to University of Chicago sociologist Mitchell G. Duneier..."<n>"In recent years social movements have increasingly used Facebook. With about twenty million activist accounts, Facebook now has more users than any other social media site in the United States, and it's likely that most activist organizations are using the site to some extent."<n>"social activism movements such as BLM (Black Lives Matter) are changing the game for modern activism."<n>"As one of few African American women who has achieved this level of influence, she now has the opportunity to help activate young African American girls.

This mode of protest is often called direct action."<n>"The movement was created to focus the strength from the 1940s Social Change, Civil Rights, Social Action, and Movement Activism (Kristal, 1991). The protests also included an element of political participation through lobbying and other legislative activities."<n>"However, the majority of this protesting did not result in the desired change of the law. One of the most prominent examples of such a demonstration was the 'Million Man March' that gathered about 1 million protesters on the steps of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. in 1995."<n><n>The same reasoning can be applied for Answer E: "Change yourself."<n>As mentioned above, the survey mentioned that three-quarters of the Millennials (aged 18-34) would take a social or political action."

Choices:  A: meadow B: cupboard C: shed D: mail box E: cellar<n><n>### Response:		If you have been bitten by a spider in the past, it is best to get rid of every possible shelter for spiders (including cupboard, shed, mail box and cellar).  Because spiders can survive up to 2 days even without eating, you are required to always keep cleaning on every corner of your house. That way, you won't get a big headache if you find a spider on or near the bed, sofa or the shower in the morning.

Closet implies a small space such as a bedroom closet. It could not be the place where the designer clothes were purchased. Additionally, mall would not be a place where expensive clothes were purchased. Lastly, the mall is a collection of stores. The store option, B, is not the correct choice.

If you do get wet, its definitely better than getting soaked to the bone. You lose much less body warmth if you can prevent your clothes from sticking to your skin and losing water to evaporate.<n><n>### IV:<n>Water has a tendency of seeping into and soaking through clothing and footwear. This can often result in people wearing wet clothing.<n><n>### V:<n>If it gets to wet then it gets stuck to you as it's moisture that keeps it from being a fully rigid structure and when it gets to wet it doesn't get stuck to each other and they start rolling up around you.<n><n>### VI:<n>The paper has some strength but its going to be weak to the elements and the elements will be working to destroy the structure of the paper.<n><n>### VII:<n>One could also be saturated with water, as in very very wet. However I can see the difference here. A crumpled paper can be restored, like if it's on you it can be flattened out. A crumple paper doesn't retain as much shape as un-crumpled paper. One dimensional is also wrong I think because its not restricted to one direction. So I can't support this answer.<n>

Choices:  A: being understood B: beer C: playing around D: hug E: visiting friends<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: beer<n><n>### Input<n>The number you are looking for is 1101. If you look at the binary representation of the number 110, notice that the third digit is 1. Now let us calculate the sum of the three binary digits. Notice that the third binary digit is 1, the second one is 0 and the first one is 1. All three of these digits have to be added up. So now, we can think about our number as 111 and our sum is 4 + 1 + 8 = 13. All we have to do is think of all the numbers until 13 (using the binary system). Notice that the number 13 has a 1 in the third position, what about the 2nd number? The number 12 has a zero in the third position, so that is not what we want. The 3rd position is a one, so then we continue with the 123 series. 123 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. We take the 1 from the first number, the 3 from the second number and the 6 from the 3rd number to find that the total of the two numbers is: 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 3 = 19. You have found the solution. The answer is 110!<n><n>### Response<n>A is the correct answer in this case. I would have started by writing down the total number of options as 5. I would have then counted the ones that start off with B (4). I would have counted the remaining options to get to E (10). So there are 4 options that do not start off with beer and 10 options that do start with beer (4 + 6). Since the options do not include any of the letters other than B, then the right answer must include at least one B. There are 10 options including B (10 + 4). So if the total number of options is 10 + 4, then the answer must be E. The options are as follows: B, C, A, E, D,F.<n>

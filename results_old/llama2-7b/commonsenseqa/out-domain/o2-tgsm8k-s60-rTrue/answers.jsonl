{"text": "The reference denies the inquiry.\n\n### Rationale:  A reference contradicts the applicant by making inquiries about the applicant that are different from what the applicant told the reference.\n\n###  References\n\nRationales: A reference might contradict \n\n1. the applicant by making an incorrect statement about the applicant, or\n\n2. the applicant by telling the employer something the applicant did not tell the reference.\n\n#### What did you learn about your character?\n\nRationales:: A reference might contradict the applicant by making comments that are so positive that they seem questionable or by making comments that are too negative. As a result, the applicant might look like a perfect angel or a perfect monster. A few examples of such comments are:\n\n* \"Rachel is an exemplary employee!\"\n\n* \"My previous employee, Sarah, is a total loser.\"\n\n* \"She is the best employee ever!\"\n\n* \"She's lazy and lazy, and I just don't hire her.\"\n\n* \"I recommend her wholeheartedly.\"\n\n* \"My employee will never make it in this town.\"\n\n#### When should you provide information to the applicant?\n\nRationalies: Providing information to the applicant is most successful when it takes place when something is going on that requires action for the success of someone else. This might mean that you need to give the applicant a heads-up, provide advice, share a strategy, or explain the current state of a particular process. Giving feedback is an effective way of providing information to the applicant.\n\n#### In general, what is someone's character?\n\nRationalees: If you were applying for a job and didn't show up, someone might say, \"You know this person didn't have the skills or skills that were required to succeed in that job. When that happens, they have no character.\" You might reply, \"I made a decision that I am not interested in that position and won't show up. I can't be the only person to do that. I did what I knew was the right thing at the time. I'm not saying that I made the best decision. I just chose to do what I thought was right.

How many more pounds of dog food does Zippo need to eat to have eaten all the dog food inside the box?\n\n#### Answer: B (7) The answer is 7 because Zippo ate 10/20 = <<10/20=1>>1 of the 20 pounds of food and left 17#+#=<<17#+#=\"414383\">>414382 pounds of food left in the box.

They can also answer more thoroughly than the teacher can because they live in the same house as the student and because the parent is not in a rush. When asked where to go, the parent will say that the computer is available between 2:00\u20133:35 p.m. on Monday through Friday and on Sunday when they know the student works on Sunday. If asked, even a peer who is a regular student at the school, cannot answer the student' question.

Each time the ball bounces, its speed will become a little less because of the resistance of the water. At the last time, the speed is at zero, but the height is still more than the beginning after bouncing a few times. Then after that, the ball goes down directly into the water.\n\n*Because the height cannot be bounced, so the time the ball bouncing is shorter than the time the ball rolling.*\n\n### Rewards:\n\nNo. The area of the surface of the ball after a bounce is smaller than the area of the surface before a bounce.\n\nNo. The surface of the ball after bounce is smaller than before bounce.\n\nAnswer: A\n\n### Rationeles:\n\n*The red and the green lines are parallel to each other.*\n\n* The length of the red and green lines are the same.*\n\n*The red line is higher than the green line.*\n\nThen we can know the red line and green line are different height.

The '!' denotes a comment, meaning the commands that follow will be commented out. A comment is used to provide extra information. The '!#/bin/sh' is a comment when placed before the '#!' which is called a'shebang'. This is used to tell the shell to use a different executable when executing the script. \n-   Write a script called \"mystery.sh\" that will calculate the sum of the numbers \"1-9\" on the command-line. When run, the script should write the sum of the numbers to the console. The answer should be \"40\". If this were executed on a non-Linux shell, the answer should still be correct.\n-   If we execute the following 'for' loop, the value for the variable $i = 1.

It is unlikely I'd find a rose in the flower garden. Even though you said to answer \u201cA,\u201d we should answer \u201cnot a lot.\u201d We know this because there might be some, but there probably aren\u2019t a lot and they\u2019re likely to be in the botanic garden (and they wouldn\u2019t be unusual anyway). A botanic garden has lots of unusual varieties of plants. It has different species. A supermarket probably wouldn\u2019t have them. Also, you have a lot of choices if you go to a botanic garden, so it has a lot more choices than a supermarket and that probably applies to other kinds of plants as well. There aren\u2019t a lot of choices in a supermarket so it wouldn\u2019t be a good place to find unusual varieties of anything, let alone roses (or other plants). An outdoor garden likely has a lot of different unusual varieties of ros (or other plants) because it has a lot of space and can have a lot of different species of plants in a lot of different places.\nIf you didn\u2019t write a response, you should have given your reasons why.

{"text": "A lonely person could commit suicide to avoid problems or end pain.\n\n### Input\nA lonely person is depressed and wants to end the pain.\n\n## Rationales\nA lonely person ends the pain by killing himself.  He wants to end the pain and solve his problems.  Suicide is the best choice for both of those outcomes.  A lonely person is unhappy and wants to avoid problems.\nSuicide is the end to the problems because it is an act that doesn't have time or a chance for people to be lonely or unhappy.\n\n## Other Solutions\n\nSolution 1: Solution 1: A lonely person could commit to suicide because avoiding problems or pain.\nSolution 2: Solving problems and avoiding pain will eventually end the lonely feeling. \nSolution 3: It is easy to suffer or be unhappy if you don't care about it.  You can commit suicide to avoid the problem.\nSolution 4: A lonely person commits suicide to avoid the problems that happen and end the pain.\nSolution: A lonely person ends his problems and wants to avoid his problems.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nA lonely person suffers a lot more than anyone not lonely which makes him suffer a lot. \n\n## Solution 2\n\nSolution 2\n\nA lonely man commits suicide, why would that be? \nA lonely man is someone who feels lonely and is depressed.  Sometimes he may have a family or friends but he doesn't enjoy them or he doesn't talk to them much.  His feelings of loneliness could be that he doesn't get attention from any of the people in the world.  This can cause pain and make a person sad.  He could commit suicide because he wants to end the pain or avoid problems.\n\nWhat would have motivated him to this act?\nHe may have been sad in the past or has had many problems before.  In the past he may have hurt himself or had people hurt him badly.  These may have led him to his suicide but the biggest cause was his mental health was weak due to past problems.  He may have chosen this because it gave him a sense of peace or because he couldn't handle everything anymore.\n\nWhat makes him", "answer": "D: unhappy"}

{"text": "The correct response is B.\n\n### Rationales:\nAccording to the definition of reckless driving, reckless driving can lead to some injuries.\n\n### Input\nWhat does reckless driving imply? Choices:\n```\n A: speeding\n B: traffic jams\n C: accidents D: injuries E: tired \n```\nInjuries may occur either due to negligent actions of a driver (traffic jam) or as a result of an accident (accident).\n### Rational:\nIf you are following the speed limit, then you are driving carefully and it is very unlikely that injuries are due to speeding. It is the driver's duty to ensure safe traffic flow and safe speed, and reckless drivers are more likely to create traffic jams, which may be a cause of an accident (either minor or fatal).\nAnother source of injuries is the action of other drivers (especially of commercial vehicles) while they are speeding, resulting in traffic jams or accidents.\n### Input: Which of these is the best explanation of a parable? Choices: \nA: story with a special meaning \nB: story with a moral \nC: statement with humor \nD: a type of literature \n\n### Inputs:\nIs a parable a story with a special meaning? \n\nIn general, the meaning should be apparent to the reader. A parable may be a story or just a brief observation or comment, intended to highlight a particular idea.\n\n### Conclusion:\nParables have a special meaning that conveys a moral (or a lesson) or a truth.\nA parable doesn't have to have a plot, with people, and events that the plot is built on.\n\n### A good parable is easy to understand and remember.\nA parable, therefore, should have a simple plot, with a short duration of action (like fable), but not without people and events.\n\n### Examples of parables:\n#### The Good Samaritan\nThe parable of the Good Samaritan.\nA man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who beat him and stripped him.\nThen passing along the road they saw a man out of the town, and they gave him, for his mer", "answer": "A: injuries"}
{"text": "---\n#### C\nPetting zoo\n\n---\n\n### Rationale:\n\n---\n* A ferret tends to be most likely to attach itself to trouser leg when it is sick.\n* This behavior is unusual to a pet owner.\n* Trouser leg is the most dangerous place for a ferret because it is so easy to leave a ferret in there, which may result when a pet's owner becomes tired.\n* If the owner is really tired, it may just ignore the pet's cry for attention and leave the pet in the trouser leg until a few hours later or when the owner notices the pet.\n* Sometimes, the pet owner may just simply forget the pet in the trousers leg.\n* When a ferret is left in the trouser leg, it may starve to death and die painfully because the owner may not open its trouser legs to give it water and sometimes enough food.\n* A pet owner may not get a chance to take the pet out of its trouser leg because its trousers may be on the ground and it may have fallen over while he or she walks.\n* This behavior can be observed in an empty house because the pet could be left outside.\n* When it is left outside, the pet will cry because it is uncomfortable in such condition and will wait for its owner to let it in so that it can sleep.\n* When a pet is left outdoors, it can get away from the cold weather by going inside.\n* When the owner is asleep, she or he will definitely notice that the pet is outside.\n* A pet can survive outside for at least 5 days without any food and two weeks without any water.\n* A ferret should be taken care of and kept in a pet cage in the house.\n* It has to get enough food to be full.\n* It drinks water at the least twice and gets fresh to eat clean water daily.\n* It gets to take a bath daily.\n* It should not be left alone.\n* It should be carried in a carrier box when travelling and not left in the car because it can get suffocated.\n* It should never walk to the bathroom on it own because it may fall in the tub or the toilet and drown.\n* It is not advisable to leave it in an empty", "answer": "D: petting zoo"}

{"text": "Choices:\n  I would take my heifer home, but I've been getting a lot of \"offers\" from wealthy farmers saying that they would have a place for her for a very generous sum of money. I've been thinking about it a lot because I believe that they are trying to bribe me to give up my prized heifer. What do I do? \n\n  My prized heifer is my best friend and she has been the best animal that I have ever had. She has the best qualities and is the strongest one of the bunch, but when the time comes for me to take her home, there is something wrong. She looks sad and I can feel her anxiety, even though I am not going anywhere. Why is she stressed out? \n\n  They say that the heifer is better off where she is at. He says that she will be safer there and that they will pay more to own her, so there is no sense in me taking her any more. I guess that it doesn't matter to me where she goes, as long as she is happy and safe.

So 36 \u00d7 1000 = <<60*(1000)=60,000>>60,00 yens were in the bank. Then in order for 60,00 \u2013 11,600 = <<6,600-11600=5,000>>5,000 yens to disappear the bank will be out of money. Therefore there were 6,000 + 5,000 = <<5,000+6000=11,000>>11,00 yens in the bank when it run out. Thus the bank ran out of money 11,00 less 11,660 = <<11,00-11,606=560>>560 days or weeks.\n\n### 560\nAnswer: 11000\n\n### Instructions:Answer 5 of 25 questions.\nInput", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

{"text": "E\n#### E\nAnswer: E\n\n#### Rationales\nThe large container was a dodecahedron, which is 12-sided. For the container to have a dime a dozen meant that it was a hodgepodge or scattered collection of many dimes, or 10 cents. In the case of this container, it was one large container with many rows of large containers inside. Therefore, the choice is E: warehouse.\n\n#### Input:A pizzeria in Texas ordered a large pepperoni pizza, a medium sausage pizza, five small Hawaiian pizzas, and ten large pizzas for a big party. How many pizzas were ordered in all? Choices: 108 B: 118 C: 101 D: 9 E: 107\n\n### Response\nE\n#### E: 101\nAnswer: Ten small pizzas were ordered with the large and  the medium pizzas, totalling to 20, and with the 101 large and  medium pizzas ordered, 5 and 50 were the only ways in which these could add up to 101.\n\n#### Rationaleses\nThe answer is E: 109. Ten were ordered for the party to make 110 total. This was one more than ten, for a total of 11, hence 110. When a person orders an item, it is a fraction and the order is divided into  how many parts. Thus, adding another pizza to the total  makes ten extra pizzas, for a grand total of 110 (100 + 10)\n\n### Input Answers:\n#### Answer: 12\nInput: An iceberg is often called a hundredweight.

{"text": "Answer: D\n\n### Input\n```\nHamlet says,\"I have nothing but a poor body and my _______.\" \n```\n\n### Rationales/Response\n**Response:** We must first understand the prompt. This is Hamlet talking. Therefore, we are looking for a possessive pronoun to fill in the blank. We have the following choices:\n\n```\n   a. his \n   b. his own\n   c. her/her own\n   d. its\n   e. its own\n```\n\nAs the sentence progresses, we see that Hamlet's mother is speaking in regards to the \"worm-eaten ______.\"\n\nWhile we have seen that the worm-eaten body refers to Hamlet's body, that's not what Hamlet's mother means. She means that it's the worm-eated body that is asking for rest. So, to figure out what Hamlet's body is asking for, let's continue:\n\n```\nHamlets words after: '_______' means my rest.\n```\n\nSo now we know Hamlet's body (the worm-eaten one) is asking for rest. Based on the previous sentences, it should be assumed his wife and mother are giving him rest in their bedrooms if they have rooms where they can give him rest (i.e., Hamlet's bedroom). So, we end up with:\n\n```\nA: grocery store   \n  b: nightstand\n\n    C: Armpits   \n  D: own bathroom\n\n       E: Medicine Cabinet\n```\nSo, let's look at the choices in sequence.\n```\nA: Grocery Store\n                 \n           Not the answer. No way.\n```\nWe can't see how him asking his wife to pick him pink or yellow soap at the store will help him with his body odor, but we do see that it might help us get a better clue if there's more to this story than we can figure out at the moment. However, there is a more clear indicator for us to answer this question.\n\n```\nB: Nightstand\n\n```\nWe see that his wife goes and gets him something to help him and then comes to him with the deodorant.

{"text": "Choice: A: riots Answer: Riots\nThe answer could be chosen because of the following:\n\"start from within, to do something would be a change in yourself. What would you be doing to start?\"\n\"Change\" or \"activism\" can only mean that someone is doing something at the moment.\"In the last five years the activist movements have been growing in their effectiveness, according to University of Chicago sociologist Mitchell G. Duneier...\"\n\"In recent years social movements have increasingly used Facebook. With about twenty million activist accounts, Facebook now has more users than any other social media site in the United States, and it's likely that most activist organizations are using the site to some extent.\"\n\"social activism movements such as BLM (Black Lives Matter) are changing the game for modern activism.\"\n\"As one of few African American women who has achieved this level of influence, she now has the opportunity to help activate young African American girls. She has been a prominent social activist and has encouraged young women to participate in community building.\"\nRationale:\n\"A recent survey finds that three quarters of millennials (those 18 to 34) would take some kind of social or political action if they thought it would make a difference.\"\n\"social activist movements that want to make a social change in the world often resort to protests, as this is what has largely defined this type of activity in the last five decades. This mode of protest is often called direct action.\"\n\"The movement was created to focus the strength from the 1940s Social Change, Civil Rights, Social Action, and Movement Activism (Kristal, 1991). The protests also included an element of political participation through lobbying and other legislative activities.\"\n\"However, the majority of this protesting did not result in the desired change of the law. One of the most prominent examples of such a demonstration was the 'Million Man March' that gathered about 1 million protesters on the steps of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. in 1995.\"\n\nThe same reasoning can be applied for Answer E: \"Change yourself.\"\nAs mentioned above, the survey mentioned that three-quarters of the Millennials (aged 18-34) would take a social or political action.\"", "answer": "C: change yourself"}

I was free, and I wasn't tied down to my education anymore.\nD.My favorite school memory is when my class went on a trip to Washington, D.C.\nE.The only thing I learned in high school was my times tables from seventh grade math.\nF.Learning has to be fun if you want students to learn. If children aren't having fun, they will resist learning and won't be as productive as they can be.\n### Read the passage(s).\nStudents these days seem to be more interested in playing video games or hanging out with their friends than learning. That's why it's not surprising that they are not learning as much as they should be, and are performing poorly on tests. It has gotten so bad that educators are being considered criminals.\nTeachers' evaluations are based on how well their students perform on standardized tests and how well their students attend class and complete their classwork and homework. But teachers cannot help students perform well on tests if they refuse to cooperate, and they can't make students attend a class or complete their classwork because students have the freedom to choose.\nTeaching is a demanding job. It takes a lot of patience and dedication to keep your students interested in what you are teaching them.\nA.Which of the ideas expressed in the passage does not reflect the author's opinion on students?\n\n1. Students these days are not the most well-behaved students.\n2. Students are not taught how to be successful.\n3. Children don't spend enough time learning outside of school.\n4. The author thinks more education is necessary to keep students out of trouble.\n\n\nB.The sentence with the incorrect subject-verb agreement", "answer": "B: fun"}

{"text": "A: beer\n\n### Input\nThe number you are looking for is 1101. If you look at the binary representation of the number 110, notice that the third digit is 1. Now let us calculate the sum of the three binary digits. Notice that the third binary digit is 1, the second one is 0 and the first one is 1. All three of these digits have to be added up. So now, we can think about our number as 111 and our sum is 4 + 1 + 8 = 13. All we have to do is think of all the numbers until 13 (using the binary system). Notice that the number 13 has a 1 in the third position, what about the 2nd number? The number 12 has a zero in the third position, so that is not what we want. The 3rd position is a one, so then we continue with the 123 series. 123 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. We take the 1 from the first number, the 3 from the second number and the 6 from the 3rd number to find that the total of the two numbers is: 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 3 = 19. You have found the solution. The answer is 110!\n\n### Response\nA is the correct answer in this case. I would have started by writing down the total number of options as 5. I would have then counted the ones that start off with B (4). I would have counted the remaining options to get to E (10). So there are 4 options that do not start off with beer and 10 options that do start with beer (4 + 6). Since the options do not include any of the letters other than B, then the right answer must include at least one B. There are 10 options including B (10 + 4). So if the total number of options is 10 + 4, then the answer must be E. The options are as follows: B, C, A, E, D,F.", "answer": "A: being understood"}

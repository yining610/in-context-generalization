A neighborhood and city both have roads that are connected to surrounding places.  A subdivision and suburb are smaller places that are completely surrounded by surrounding areas.  A street may be part of a suburb or city.  So looking at the options the best places to look are a suburb or city since those both have gated off neighborhoods that are completely surrounded.<n><n>### Input::How can she tell if the man will ask her to go in a restaurant with him?

Fallen trees do not support the growing of fungus since there is no nutrient to support its growth. And to get food in a grocery store you need sunlight which would create too many disturbances for the fungi. Fungi grow in damp environments so places that don't have enough light would not help the fungus grow properly. Lastly toenails are covered by skin.

Plastics or polymers are known for its low tensile strength. In other words, a strong force will easily tear apart plastic materials. Even though the plastic is strong enough to support its own weight, it won’t withstand great forces that may come its way.<n><n>#### Massless<n><n>It will be a very difficult building if it is made of materials that have no mass. For instance, if a building is made out of an aether material then it is massless. An aether material is a theoretical type of matter that is supposed to exist in parallel or beyond the time and space we see in the observable universe.

I would not need a large amount of paper at once so I would think that the suitcase and artist's studio are out of the question. I also do not want paper that is too tall or I may encounter trouble folding it so I would also want thin paper. If I go to the cabinets I will be missing out on options because they may already be stocked or may not have what I need at all. The computer printer would be expensive and may not be something that we need.

Choices:  A: cattle ranch B: countryside C: grocery store D: slaughterhouse E: dairy farm<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n><n>### Rationales: A cattle ranch has cowboys working on it. The countryside has a lot of cattle roaming around, but it does not have cowboys. The grocery store has grocery clerks and the dairy farm has milkmen. However, none of them take care of the sick or injured animals. The slaughterhouse is like a meat factory as they slaughter the animals to process as meat products for people to consume. <n><n>### Demostration: A cowboy will not likely let an injured cow stay in the countryside. A farmer probably will not let a cow stay in the city. A shopper will not let a cow in their store. However, a farmer's job is to take care of the animals. Therefore, the cow should be in the slaughterhouse if he was not able to heal.<n><n>### Answer: The heifer is in the right place.<n><n>

Write complete and thoughtful responses. Use proper grammar and spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.  Provide appropriate mathematical computations that are aligned to the multiple choice question or other instructions provided to you. Provide correct and adequate responses to all the parts of the instructions. If the instruction asked you to identify a certain number in a sentence, then you _should_ identify the correct number (in the sentence), even if that number _cannot_ be said to be 3, 2, or 5. This point is often missed.  If you are _asked_ or requested to find a _certain number_, you should only identify or compute or type that particular number (in the given sentence). Do not _guess at all_ or randomly select numbers in the sentence. If an instruction asks you to find certain things such as the _number of months_ or the _total cost_ in a sentence, then your answer should only include that _exact phrase_ (as in the number of months or the total cost).  Avoid randomly guessing just any number that you feel like typing. If you are not asked to type something that _can also be said to be 13, 32, 8,  and 12_, you are NOT requested to type _any one of_ 13, 12, 8 or 32. The assessment is not trying to see how many options you can think of. It is only trying to see how correctly you can identify or type what is asked in the sentence.  There are not any points that will be deducted for failing to type or identify any numbers that are NOT also 13, 25, 8, 12, or 20.<n><n>## Parts of a Task<n><n>> When the instructions start with a multiple choice question, you must respond by identifying (and typing) the correct multiple choice answer in the sentence.<n><n>> When the task continues with either mathematical calculations (such as

I know that, with interest, my money will double every 10 years.  I don't quite know how much money I will need for retirement, I just know that it will be at least twice what I have now.  I'm hoping to earn 6% interest each year.  What would I need to save each month to get my money doubled every 10 years (or, in 10 years, have twice as much as I have now)?  There are 12 months in a year.<n>Rationales:So I have 10 years*360 days/year, I have in total $(<<10*360=3600>>3600) days, so I have $(<<3600*6%*1%=<<600>>600$) in interest a year, so I will have $(<<600*10>>6000$) after 10 years<n><n>However I want to have $(<<10*2>>10000%) doubled, so my $(<<6000%>>)  should actually be $(<<12000%>>12000%)<n><n>I have $6000,  Now I need $12000  so I will have $((6000 * 12000/12)/100 % ) (<<6000*12000>>60%)<n><n>Thus I have<n><n>$(((<<6000>>*21/$100%))%$<<6000*$21/(100%)$))<n><n>That results $(<<600/36%>>) in 1200 which equals $(<<600>>/1944000%*$100%$/100%)<n><n>So to get $\$360000\$ after 10 years, I need $\$2400\$ every month  and if I wanted it in one year I would need $\$24$\$.<n><n>So all I need to do is $

Choices:  A: sheath B: sword closet C: collection D: container called scabbard E: museum<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I bet a lot of them you found were on A, B, or C. As for D you’d have probably seen a lot of the swords in a museum because they are more for decoration. They tend to be very big or very small and they don’t have a hilt on them. Anything with a hilt is E.<n>A sword sheath is where you protect it from dirt and rust. The sword has a hilt, which is the handle that protects those fingers you use to grip the sword.  The shaft of the blade is called the blade, and it has a sharp pointy tip or edge at both ends, and it’s what you use to cut and chop. The hilt can come in various shapes, but they're usually in a handle shape, like a hollow sphere, a cylinder, a leaf, or a cross section of a leaf.<n><n>### Input for the second choice:<n>What are some things we see in modern-day Japan?<n><n>Some things you probably see are martial arts like karate. It’s mainly used for protection and self-defense in everyday situations.<n>If you’re thinking of food then sushi probably comes to mind for most people. It’s another commonly known food from Japan for it’s very unique taste. Nigiri and sashimi are the two main types of it. You may eat sushi from bamboo leaves to avoid a lot of rice from spilling out.<n>In fashion, some people think kimonos can be a sign of nationality, although they don’t define it as “national dress.” It is worn primarily, but not completely, by women. Geiko, who can be men or women, are more commonly associated with kimonos these days.<n><n>#### Bonus:<n><n>One interesting thing I haven’t mentioned yet is the traditional sword called katana. This is the actual traditional sword and it’s made out of very strong tempered steel. They are used for various types of combat, but now they are used for show. However, they must be very sharp and be treated with resin to keep it strong.<n><n>I hope this helps you understand the context better!<n><n>### Input <n>If you're thinking about the future, how would you go back in time?

This choice means living room, since "living room" is an ad and "divider" is also an ad.<n>2.   The phrase is "to store papers", which can be separated by the word "for" between "stores" and "paper". But since the first word ("store") and the last word ("paper") can't be one word because of the limit of characters, the word ("for") must be included in the sentence. <n>3.   "Stores" is a verb with "papers" as the complement.  So "store" goes with the following preposition "for". <n>4.   The sentence requires a preposition since "to store papers" could be a stand-alone sentence.

The customers often don't like that her face is always covered in whipped cream.  So, she is trying to find a way to eat the whipped cream without it dribbling on her face.  She has an idea.  If she puts her face in a paper bag, it acts as a face mask for her facial hair and prevents the whipped cream from dripping onto her face.  She can then blow her uncovered nose to clean off the bag.  How well does this plan work?  Use the information given below.<n><n>Input: When she blows, the bag blows away, because air pressure is exerted on the sides of the bag.<n>Rationales: A bag being blown away is being pushed away, because air pressure wants to use it or escape it<n>So when air pressure gets near the bag it wants to use it and it doesn't want to use the other side of the bag<n><n>### Response<n>Whenever she blows the bag will always blow away, regardless of where she puts it.  That's because she blows away. <n>#### The answer is B.<n>**Because the air doesn't press it, it will remain.**<n>

Using greedy algorithm, write a program to get the maximum sum possible for the input array.<n><n>#### _****([5])****_<n>1. Create a function named sum() with parameter as an array and return the sum of the values in the input array. And then call the function with input array.<n>2. Initially, sum() can be used to find the maximum sum in the given array.<n>3. The above approach will not work because it is possible that some number cannot be added.<n>4. Hence we have to replace the previous function with new one while iterating on current element in the input array.<n>5. Now, in the new function, the while loop is modified with an if condition.<n>6. If the current value is smaller than the previous value, change the while condition to iterate further with the current array value.<n>7. However, if the current value is larger than the previous value, do not iterate further to that value, simply break the while loop to find the sum with that particular value.<n>8. Finally sum() is used to get the maximum sum from the input array.<n>#### 5<n>Answer:<n><n>### Inputs:<n><n>**14630230753277979<n>** 1<n><n>** <n>** 20850073198239646<n>** 1<n>**<n><n><n>### Outputs:<n>    "120479130233544396"<n>#### 120470913025384496<n>Answer:<n><n><n>##

The record store no longer exists, so that option is also unavailable. A record album sounds like something to buy in the record store but it is not quite right as well.  A better option would be the record store. Additionally, the item would not fit on one's wall.  A better option is a bookstore or record store.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>D does not fit because a vinyl would be a different type of record, like a sheet of vinyl for the kitchen.  C does not fit because a record album is something of the past, and does not fit with contemporary trends. E does not fit because a wall would be the last thing a person would buy.

When they have meetings with one another, it's all good because police officers know everything in each other. They tell each other about the past, present and future, all the good stuff we did and all the bad stuff we did.<n><n>The desk drawer has a building of glues, because when the class teacher has a class, sometimes the students have assignments that include art. When the students do art, they often glue many things to a cardboard box and draw pictures. When they make their art and glue things it's important to let the artist put the glue on the box.<n><n>The school building also has a building of glue, because when the teacher takes the students to the desks, the students have papers that they have to copy down and the students also have many things to write about. When they have assignments, the students put glue on their worksheets and draw things. So when the staff takes the teachers and students up the stairs, they put a lot of glue on top of the desktops.<n><n>The class also has a lot of containers of glue. The desks had a lot of containers of art.  The art box was a cardboard box that was covered by paper, so I didn't see if the desks still had some of their art boxes. But when I look at the desks, they have some of those boxes on top of the desk. When the students use the desks, the teacher gives the teacher a box of paper and the students use the desktops as they usually do. The classroom doesn't have the art box, but the school has it. When a student uses a desk, they put some glue on the box to the desk and then write things on their desk. <n><n>### A: Art room<n>When school students use arts and crafts supplies at the art room, it looks like they'll use some of their arts supplies at the art supplies.

To answer the question input each choice and the corresponding rationales.<n><n>> The following table shows the sales of an office supply store.  They sell $11,200 worth of file cases to lawyers each month, $9,000 worth of tape dispensers to engineers, $6,300 worth of folders to secretaries, $1,475 worth of writing paper to students, and $585 worth of white-out to retirees.  Write a ratio that is equivalent to the sum of the ratios of sales in each category.<n>   Rationales: <n>There are two ways to do this. The first is to do division. <n>To find the total sales for each category, simply do the division of the whole sales by all the respective amounts of sales for each category.<n>For file cases, do ($11,20 ÷ 9,000 = 1.25)<n>For tape dispensers, simply divide ($11,2 ÷ 6,300 = 1)<n>For folders (11,20+6,300)/12,600 = 5.75<n>For white out (11,2 ± 585)/12,685) = 1.585<n>For student use (11,2 + 1,475)/12,715 = 9.333<n><n>The second way of doing it is taking the sum of the rations for each category and find the equivalent ratio for that sum. This approach will result in the same answer. For this approach, we simply add up all the rations, multiply them by 100, and do division by 100. <n>The sum will equal $11,2 + $11,2 ≈ $22,4<n>The 100 multiplied by the total sum will equal

Dimes are 10, so $10.00. Dollars are 100, so $1,000.50, but since we want the nearest whole number, we round. A dollar is 100 cents, so $1,500 is $1.00 over. So round the thousandth decimal place. 5 is 5.1, and 5.0 (rounded up) can be expressed as 5.00, so $5.00 is correct. Now try this!<n><n>##### 4.00*100 = $400.00<n>##### 5.50*100  = $550.00<n>

Choices:  A: pleasure B: accident C: get somewhere D: hurt E: falling down<n><n>### Response:		<n>If someone was riding on rough terrain they could get hurt, they could also find themselves in an accident. The only other option that matches this sentence is that they could fall down. If they were riding on road that is straight or less rugged than what they were riding on, they could not find themselves in an accident or hurt or fall down. So the only answer that makes sense is E=falling down<n><n>### Example:<n>If I went and rode a bike through a park or on an open road, there isn't really any way I could find myself in an accident or in an injured state. But if I rode my bike on a road that is rugged or downhill, in that case I could get hurt or accidentally knocked down and get injured even though I have never been injured by riding a bike.

Choices:  A: go to bed B: sleep C: listen to music D: stretch out E: stop worrying<n><n>### Response:		In this context bed, sleep, music, stretch, and stop-worrying mean the same thing, or could be considered synonymous. Therefore, the correct answer is bed.<n><n>### Clarification:<n>The question asks what the passengers did and what a passenger did. The verb of the question is "were" which means the other passengers were doing what the question said, not what the passengers did. There is no "were" verb in the question, but it means the other passengers were going to stop worrying and then listen to music, instead of go to the bathroom or get food because they were too scared. The passengers are scared, not the music. There is an "are"- verb, but it is not used in this context, and we know the passengers were not actually doing what the passengers did.<n><n>### Input A passenger stopped worrying. How? Choice a - got back on the bus.<n>Choice b - ate some food c. got a drink d. listened to music e. tried not to think about the police.<n><n>### Response A passenger got back on the bus, and listened to music. The other two options are not on the list, and the passenger is not worrying about other things. If they stopped worrying about the police, they would have gotten back on the bus or tried not to think about it. The verb in the question was "were scared", which refers to the passengers getting back on the bus, or listening to music. The passenger would not stop worrying, if they already listened to music, and stopped worrying about the passengers. Therefore, the correct answers are c and d.<n><n>### Choice a. A: got on the bus. B: Ate some food. C. got a drink.  <n>D. listened to music. E. tried not to think<n><n>### Clarifications:<n>Getting back on the bus, can be a response to getting off a bus, but it could also be getting back on the bus because the passengers are getting back on the bus to listen to music. Eating food would be when the passenger got off the bus and got food. A passenger would not get back on the same bus, eat food, and listen to music, or try not to think about the passengers. If the passenger listened while going back on the bus, then that would be an option. This would not mean, stop worry

It was putting handcuffs on him. It had nothing to do with a crime. He was not brought in after he committed a crime.`<n>`That's exactly what we wanted to do. What's the most painful way to arrest people without physically arresting them? We got a warrant, we got someone's address, we sent the police to put a lock on their gate. What's more frightening as an arrest? The police showing up to arrest you, which never happens.`<n>`So, our civil arrest was to arrest their liberty. They were not coming up to jail. They were coming up to arrest their freedom and liberty. They couldn't go where they wanted, they couldn't see whatever they wanted. The best way of arresting somebody is not physically arresting them.`<n><n>### Dem<n>https://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2018/02/10/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-controversial-fees-must-fall-movement_a_23349415/<n><n>### Response

Option A, B and D cannot store canned food since they are located in the kitchen or a home for that matter, that being said, all of our options are either part or not part of the kitchen. C is the only option that stores canned food as it is a grocery store. And since it states that it must be above any of the choices, it means it has to be above the kitchen sink which is located in the kitchen, and given this, then option to store canned food above the kitchen sink must be option E which is the store cellar.<n><n>### Input<n>How long did it take you to memorize the words to the entire song?<n><n>### Response<n>In order to answer this question we must first answer the question of how did it take you to learn the entire song, and the answer to that will be answered in steps.<n><n>First, answer the question asking when did you learn it or how to you learn it?<n><n>Well, you learned it in small parts right? Right, that means that you learned it in steps which is equivalent to the question "how?" since you are asking how you learned it and the answer to that question is how? which means in this case small parts. And what did you learn it with? For example, you have memorized a small part of the song and then after memorizing the small part you add another small part to it and then once you achieved that add on a third part to the end of it. Now that you have added on another part to the end then you add another small part from the begining in which you will add it to the end. And how do you know when you are done? Well, as you are doing this you ask yourself if you know at least 1500 words of the song right? 1500 is the size of the song to be in your head. After doing this for a moment or so and then you say that you know the song. And do you feel it? Yes, there is a chance it could be in your head, but maybe there is a small part that you don't know it all of yet or 100% which means you don't know the song completely. After you did 1500 in your head

There are different levels to what one needs in a game from edge to rivalry.  The different levels are<n>- The Edge<n>This level is simply when you do your best and the game will be as good as you make it.  That being said, the more time and effort you put into the game, the more it will mean to you.  It takes up time and has effects on you mind set.<n><n>- Skills<n>- Wanting to win<n>- Friendships<n>- Rivalry<n>All of these different levels will have different effects on you.  The edge will affect you more mentally, while needing to win will really make you think about your situation, desiring rivalry is going to make you look at the game from the perspective of your opponents as well as your own and friendships are what keeps you focused on your goals.<n><n>### Input/Answer:<n>Choose the answer that best explains the scenario.<n><n>Answer: The answer is:<n><n>    A. Friendship<n>   <n>Explanation:<n><n>As the question explains, people want different things out of competition. Most people want to win the games, which means they are competitive. Others may only want to develop skills or just participate in a hobby. Some players play for the fun or the friends only.<n><n>### Coding:<n><n>I first made an if statement that would have the program ask for the players initials (the first word) and their age (the second word) of the players name. I then used switch statements and a case statement. I used the switch and case statements so that no matter how many people are playing in an event, I could have multiple things for every switch statement.<n><n>### Demo:<n><n>- Here is the demo:<n>- This is what the program will ask for to start.<n>- First player has to enter their initials, then their age<n>- Then it will ask for the second players things<n>- Then third<n>- And so on<n><n>- When the program reaches a certain stage, like player 4, the program will start to check who won.  The checker will say it was the person to write the least code.<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>- If we had a program that would make a baseball game without you doing any code, this is what it would be.

Choices:  A: candy store B: butcher shop C: kitchen D: auto repair shop E: post office<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### A<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Input: John decided to take a break from work. He picked the place, and the menu, on a whim. He took his coworkers to the candy store. As expected, everyone has a great time, and they've had so much fun that they stayed another two hours than they planned. In hindsight, John should have chosen the butcher shop.  He forgot to pick up his friend the meat from his butcher shop to make sandwiches at lunch. He was also running out of ideas for a weekly lunch meeting at work.<n><n>#### E<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Input: The post office is a mail center. You could do anything from sending packages, letters, and bills as well as getting the latest news.<n><n>### Answer:<n>####B<n><n>### Rations:<n>Input: A butcher shop does not sell what you are buying. Anything you can buy from the candy store or any other shop that sells candy, you can get from the butcher shop as well.<n><n>### Input-Answer:<n>Input: John took some candy from the candy store to work for the bosses; he made sure the boss had a sweet tooth.<n><n>### Output:<n>There's nothing the candy store can do when they find out the candy was stolen. They'll have to pay for it. The boss is not happy after receiving his favorite candy treat. He calls his HR to fire the thief, only to learn he has no job the next day.<n><n>### Rationals:<n>John knows how to steal. The only person who steals sweets is him. You can do almost anything with stealing.

Your task is to write two statements that demonstrate how to stop the ship. One will be written in Python, the other will be demonstrated graphically. You may use any Python code that we covered in this class. Please include a description for your statement.<n><n>#### I.python.<n>In this program you are going to use a while True loop to generate every single iteration of the program. The loop ends when you say so with a break. In each iteration you are calculating momentum using the following variables: 0 for x-axis, 1 for y-axis, 2 for z-axis, 3 for the change in movement on each axis. In each iteration you will add a force that is proportional to the momentum you calculate. When adding that force, you will use the add operation to add a vector. You will be calculating speed as well, if speed of a new iteration is greater than 1 (meaning over the speed limit) you will start slowing the ship down (adding an opposite force to the previous force) until that force is 0 and speed is less than 1.<n><n>#### II.Graphical<n><n>Input: the ship will stop by increasing speed in a way that it is proportional to how much it is moving.<n><n>#### III.Graphical<n><n>### Comments:<n>#### I.python<n>#### II.<n>#### III.<n>

Choices:  D: music engineers E: industrial engineers<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Input: Talk: If you don't know which type a person's work is about then you can at least expect to learn something.  If you talk to a musician, then you can be certain to learn more about music.<n>Book: It's like looking at a dictionary.  If you read a dictionary from front to back then you would know more words.<n>Playing piano: If you play a piano then you're likely using your piano ability more often, while still using the piano skill.  Also, you can learn to play piano if you never have.<n>Studying engineering:  If you read an engineering book, you're likely to learn new things about engineering.  If you study an engineering book, then you are expected of greater retention of lessons, therefore using the concepts better.<n><n>Output: Types of engineers: It is logical that music engineers and industrial engineers wouldn't ever have to play piano.  Those types of engineers already have and use pianos for their work.  It's unlikely that a music engineer has to use piano, instead, using a computer to record music or sing.<n>Also it's unlikely that music engineer need to play piano, because they have work to do if they're listening to music and practicing songs.<n>Likewise if you're an industrial engineer then it's unlikely that you'd have to play piano too.  That would be pointless because an engineer is hired for his or her knowledge of engineering, not to be a pianist.<n><n>#### Music engineers<n>Industrial engineers<n><n>## Answer:<n>What are 2 types engineers who will never study piano?

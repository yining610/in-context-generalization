A number of subspecies also exist, all of which vary in terms of size, markings and coat thickness. Foxes are opportunistic hunters, eating fruits, nuts, small vertebrates, and carrion wherever they can find it.\n\nFoxes are often believed to be fox-like dogs, but these two animals are completely different. While dogs do have some wild relatives like wolves, foxes are not members of the canine species and, accordingly, are not considered by some to be a true wild animal.

{"text": "### Input::What is the answer to 4 divided by 2? Choices:  Answers: <<12>>12\n\n# Exercise:\n### Task:\nAn employee is using the 50% rule to calculate the employee's total earnings from wages and other compensation received in the workplace. This employee was paid $7,300 in wages plus $2,300 in other compensation. The employee received a 50% reduction in wages and a 25% reduction in other compensation. An additional 3% reduction was granted on a per-hour basis. Add all reductions. Enter your answer as the number of dollars after all reductions as follows: $12.70.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe 50% rule means that half of what they earn becomes taxable income, which can affect other types of benefits. When the federal government calculates taxable income for Social Security, they don't automatically include the cost of living adjustments given to employees, which can significantly impact their final paycheck amount.\nWages\nThe 50/30/20 rule dictates how much of an employee's total earning income can be taxed as \"ordinary income\" while other sources of income are taxable as \"unearned\" income and \"capital gains.\" When this rule applies to wage income, the total amount you owe in taxes is determined by dividing the total amount earned by 100% and then multiplying the resulting number by your tax bracket rate. This rule does not apply in every situation; it only applies if it's your only source of earned income.\nThe wage-earning reduction is based on wages as a percentage of other types of income. Depending on the type of job, wages can be a small percentage of total income. As a result, most employees pay a higher rate of federal income tax than they would if they were paid in cash or another non-wage form like a salary.\nOther Income\nThe employer deducted 25% of wages to equalize the total earning with all other income. The remaining 25% of other income is still taxed as income, which lowers the employee's taxable income to $12,700.", "answer": "A: sitting down"}

We have $1 for the cheese, but $3.25 in total. Therefore we have $.50 to spend for other things. We can use it to buy more cheese or we can use it to buy other things. We can't use all of it because we are getting $.50 cheese for every $.50 spent.

In the case of Alcohol, the person is not himself/herself when drunk, because for him/her speech doesn\u2019t feel like coming through the mouth, but through the mind. The tongue is not free, the person speaks what his mind feels is good enough to express or share with other people.\n\nHowever, when talking non-sense, the person is totally unaware of what he is getting himself into. He speaks anything that comes to mind, not because the person is drunk; he just isn\u2019t thinking rationally.\n\nIn the case of illicit drugs it\u2019s not just any kind of drugs, it\u2019s the same drug that makes the person forget himself/herself, and the person isn\u2019t aware of what\u2019s going on in this case too.

A week later it seems as thought they never finished this step and the rest of the group is in the office with you preparing data for analysis. What do you do?\n\n### Instructions 1:Answer the question below.\n\n### Rationals 1:\nThe employees have a deadline of a month, and they have not delivered on time and are working against the clock. If the group of employees are working against the clock with a very tight deadline then they probably need more direction and help from the leader. They could also maybe need better communication or a change of plans. A leader has to know all of these things and make decisions to make sure they complete the task on time.

Since the object is on the floor there would not be a straight line since the line would have to be at an angle. The shortest angle of travel would go around the object. That is the smallest amount of travel since it must go around every point the person is away from the wall.\n\n### Response \nThere is no shortest distance to the object. There would be a straight line but it would go over the wall and would not be shortest anymore.\n\n### Task\n1. What is the maximum common difference of an arithmetic sequence?(Use 5 as start number and end number, and use no for the last term of the sequence.)\n\n### Rationale\n5 is the largest number that can be used as the number of the sequence in which 5 becomes the end number.\n\n### Maximum Common Difference of an Arithmetic Sequence\nThe maximum common difference of an a arithmetic sequence is the largest common difference of an a+1 arithmetic sequence.\n\nIf one begins with a term of the sequence, the end term will be a+r=<<5+2>>5+2 where r is the first common difference. The first term will always equal the end term.\n\nThe maximum value of first difference is equal to the first term-last term + the first term. This would equal 5 - 5+5 = 15\n\n### Response - Answer: \nThe maximum common difference is 15.\n\n##  Task 3 -- Explanation \n### Instruction 3\n\n### Demnstration 3\n\nInput:The sum of the first five terms of an arithmetic sequence is 24.

Choices: A: take out pennies and put back into the dish B: throw the pennies back in the dish C: return penny dish to the counter D: continue as is, you cannot return pennies to the dish E: leave the pennies in place and wait 5 days.\n\n### Response 2:\nIf the dish with pennies is not divisible by three, take out only one penny at a time or get rid of pennies and get new ones. If a person decides for the alternative option which is to 'put back into the dish' the dish with pebbles cannot be returned to its place, because there is already a dish with pennys inside. The dish cannot be a dish with pebles and pennys at the same time. If we keep pebles and pebles at the same time we would have pebles, pennys and the dish, because one should remain with the pennys and another with pebles the third is the dish. Another alternative would be putting the dish with pebbels into a bag and taking one out with each option, this would probably take longer than the first option. There are only three options to add to the pebbles, one would be adding the one pebble with the option 'one penny'.\n\n### Input\nInput: You are walking east. You meet a man carrying a box and a dog.

For example, a basketball player might be looking for the proper shoe so he would visit a store, buy a pair of shoes.\n\n**city:** Since city is part of athletic equipment, we can consider cities as part of the answer.\n\n**espn:** We can watch the game on ESPN but we wouldn't be the player.\n\n**town:** We might see a town on the broadcast when we watch our sport game on ESPN. However, in this question, we can't exclude this as an answer.\n\n**jerseys:** we wear our jersey when we play the game. We do not visit a store specifically to buy our jersey. We usually purchase our jerseys at our local sporting goods store, but I wouldn't consider this as an answer. Since the question is only asking for the number of sporting good stores, the best answer to pick is a store or city.\n\nIf there a city with hundreds of sporting goods stores, it would be New York.\n\n### Input:[\n\n[\n{\n\"name\": \"juguetes-y-games\"\n},\n{\n\"name\"\": \"juguete-de-navegador\"\n},\n{ \n\"name\":\"tallaje-del-pandilla\"\n},\n{ \"name\": \"jugando-porn\"\n},\n{   \"name\": \"gaming-pcs\"\n},\n]\n]\n\n### Response:[\n\n[\n[\n\"juguete-navegador\",\n\"juguetes-i games\",\n\"tallaje-del\",\n\"gaming-d p", "answer": "B: city"}

I should walk over the 1 inch indentations to keep my walk straight\n####\n### Input:\n### Choices:\n\nWrite a sentence describing and giving context to the below instruction to find the sum \n\n### Response to above questions:\nI notice that the sidewalk has an odd arrangement of 5 indentations that are evenly shaped and 1 inch apart.\nWe have to walk by these 5 indentations.  The sum of three even numbers is always even, meaning the sidewalk must be 3 inch long because an odd+odd sum = even\nOne other thing I notice is theres a car coming from the street. It is on a yellow when I walk over the indentations. \nHowever, when I walk over the three indentations, I get closer to the car before it turns off yellow into red indicating that I'm not exactly 3 inch in from the street and need to find a better estimate.\nThe length of the 3 indentation street section is approximately 2 inches. The red light starts with the 3rd indentations. To get the approximate distance I have to subtract 2 inches from the distance I have from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd indentations, which is 7. The 5th indentation must be less than 1 inch away from the car. That would mean the total estimated distance to the car is 7+5=12 in \n####\n### Choices for Sum :\n\nThe number of indents in a series is odd.\nTherefore the series must have an even sum such as (S+S+S)+C equals S*(S+1)/2.\nIn this case S=<<5>> and C=<<3>>, meaning we have to find S*(S+1)\nS*", "answer": "A: mouth"}

{"text": "55\n\n## Solutions 1\n1. In this question, the author describes a task for which we need to write a response. This response has instruction, demonstration, and the last one is the input. The instructions for this question are written in the sentence \"Demonstration:\". In this demonstration, the expression \"+\", \"-\" and \"*\" are being used as operators. We write the \"demo\" like this, \"55\" for an equation of the form \"a+b=c\". We also use the expression \"Answer:\". So this demonstration represents a math equation. We write the equation in the way that the first three letters are \"Input:\". An equation in English does not necessarily represent a full statement but rather an information that helps us find an answer. Then, we write our answer (\"55\"). So the answer is the answer to the math equation, not necessarily the answer to the question. The other two sentences are there as extra information or an explanation of the demonstration. A summary: (1) there is the question and it contains a \"math equation\" (which is a demonstration) and there will be (2) the answer.\n\n### Notes\n- The first sentence of the question and the first sentence of the demonstration are the same. In this case, the answer to the instruction is \"55\".\n- Since there is no explicit mention that this demonstration is about the arithmetic, I take a wild guess and then test out solutions by inputting the guess. Since I take this guess, I assume the last sentence is an explanation.\n## Solutions 2\n1. The instruction:\n```\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n```\n2.

However, I only have enough red paint to color them six in red.\nIn that case, I will keep the twelve blue hats.\n\n### Test Run\n\n#### Example Input\n\n### Response Example\n\n### Input Example\n\n### Instructions:\nHow many times the 4th term of the AP is 100.\n\n### Detailed Direction:\n\nIf you divide the 4th term by the initial term of the series, then you will get 100. This is because 100 is the 4th term divided by 1. To find the number of times the 4th terms is 100, divide the 4th number 100 by 1. You will get 1. Thus, 1 is the number of times the series is 100 to form the initial term, 1. You can also multiply the number of times by the sum of the numbers in the series. If you multiply by the sum of the series, you get 174.\n\n### Example Output\n\n### Instructor:\nA new caterer opened her business on main street.

{"text": "The input: \"if one sees a fox in a coastal gulf state, where one is\" seems like the description to a riddle or some other kind of word problem.\n\nLet's break it down. First, the if one sees is a predicate expression that tells you that the following is true with respect to fox(x). The truth of that predicate is then determined by some information about the predicate. The predicate is not true if one does not first encounter a fox. However, when the predicate is true, the predicate information must also include an indication that that person is in a coastal, but not mountainous, gulf state. There are two major gulf coast states that are coastal (Alabama and Louisiana), and three that are not coastal (Arkansas, Mississippi, and South Carolina). Thus, we can determine that if one sees a fox one is in one of the coastal gulf states: Alabama, or Louisiana. However, one is not in the mountainous states Arkansas or South Carolina, and one also is not in the non-coastal non-mountainous states Mississippi or Oklahoma.\n\nTherefore, if one sees a fo, one is in a coastal gul, which means one is in Alabama or Louisiana. \n\n### Input:\"Rank the objects in the following list from largest to smallest.

In elementary school I would get my homework done right away and hand it in. In middle school I would turn it in right next to last because of a certain project that was important in middle school. Junior year I only did a little bit of my homework right away and turned it in when  I felt like it was completely finished. When I first started high school I was behind on my grades so during first semester I had to go through a lot of work and stay up late in the morning working on things a few weeks in advance. I stayed up a lot that semester and got behind on my social life. The second semester my teachers were giving homework late and I turned my homework in the week afterwards.\n##### B) What did you learn about writing and math from your experience?\nI feel like I learned to write out assignments on paper and use highlighters instead of a laptop because if I use my laptop I get distracted by other tabs, which ends up taking me longer to finish my homework. I like to use highlighters because they are colorful and easy to read. During writing classes we talked about the format of an essay, if it was from the past it would include a title, thesis, body and conclusion. The math I have learned about writing out my math problems is to do the hardest part and then slowly add in. This has helped me because the first step for me is always to calculate the answer and see the answer I got.\n##### C) Describe any similarities and differences between your high school and class.\nMy high school is a lot different than this class because in my class the teachers are more lenient and they don\u2019t expect you to memorize things when given homework and they expect you to have a conversation with them when you\u2019re struggling.

{"text": "C\n\n### Why:Sickle cell disease usually doesn\u2019t cause symptoms until its later stages. It can cause severe pain during a crisis called a \u201csickle cell crisis.\u201d You have symptoms of sickle cell crisis when sickled red blood cells block small blood vessels throughout your body. This blocking causes pain. You may have swollen, tender hands and feet. But you may have other signs and symptoms in other areas of your body, too.\n\n#### Sickle cell crisis: A sudden and severe episode of pain caused by severe disease complications or red blood cell blockages. Pain may begin in one part of the body and spread. Certain factors may increase your risk of a sickle cell crisis. They include dehydration, high altitude, low oxygen pressure and stress.\n\n#### Why: If it has been a while between crises, then a person may not realize they have sickle cell disease. Sometimes when a crisis occurs the patient will just blame the pain on the last crisis. However, it is important to remember that a sickle cell crisis does not always occur with each other. If the patient is not taking the medication or have not treated their sickle cell disease well then they may have the symptom. They should also tell the doctor what drugs that they use. A person with sickle cell disease may have a crisis that may be related to something that they ate or it could be due to an infection. A doctor will diagnose a person if they have had a crisis in the past and then they will continue treatment after this.\n\n#### Why not: If a person has the disease it may cause a lot of pain in their body. Then they will have an ache for a certain period of time. After this time the person will not have any problem for a certain period of pain. They will feel the pain and then it go away after a certain period of time or they may not even be feeling the pain anymore. They may feel the pain on the side or it could be in the stomach or even the back. After a while, it will go away and then, the person will not feel anything.\n\n#### Why both: The symptom could occur due to high altitude or stress. If you go up there, you will feel tired and it will be hard for you to breathe, then the sickle cell crisis will be occur. Stress can", "answer": "B: sporting event"}

Many people associate a lack of workplace privacy with an improved work environment. When employees work in an office rather than their home, they are less likely to suffer from stress and burnout. 2.Many people associate a lack of space with distractions from the workplace. Workplace privacy should be a concern for every professional because private work spaces can boost productivity and employee satisfaction. 3.The productivity of our firm, which is one of the leading technology businesses, relies on several elements. What role does office privacy play in the workplace? To begin with, employees who work from home usually do so out of necessity, while those who work in an office environment do so by choice. 4.Employee dissatisfaction is frequently linked to a lack of privacy. 5.The average office worker can lose productive time in four places, including the following:  I. The average office worker spends three hours each week searching for and digging through the information. III. The average office worker is distracted by at least ten people every day. IV. Lack of privacy in the office makes it difficult for employees to interact with co-workers and focus on their work. V. Poor office privacy also prevents an office worker from relaxing during breaks and from focusing on work during personal time. 6.The office space is an employee's second-largest work expense. It is important to consider privacy in hiring, office design, and training. 7.One of the most significant benefits of working from home is that you don't have to pay travel fees. 8.According to research, working at home can increase productivity by 8-16%, while increasing job satisfaction by 13-37%. 9.Many office workers believe that workstation design is the same as ergonomics. Workplace privacy is crucial because privacy is a critical component of good ergonomics in the workplace. 10.Office workers' productivity is negatively impacted by factors such as noise and distractions. 11.According to research by the International Data Corporation (IDC), 20-35% of workspace is wasted. 12.Lack of space for work", "answer": "C: do work"}

{"text": "In a hospital, the doctor's office is the one place where people do not sit in the arm chair.\n### Conception:\nIn hospitals people do not take a seat to the doctors\u2019 offices because they use their time seeing the doctor and not resting in the seats. The doctors always have the chairs occupied with patients who are visiting them.\n\n### Response Rationale:\n\n### In Hospital  _D_\n\nA hospital contains many people who are uncomfortable with sitting in the armchairs. Many things happen in hospital settings that might involve someone falling ill or getting injured or under-going any medical procedure thus hospitals have many people visit to the various clinics and doctors\u2019 offices. The doctors always take priority in getting the arm chairs occupied with their patients and leaving other people waiting outside the room. The only time these armchairs are going unoccupied is when the doctor\u2019s room is unoccupied or when a doctor leaves the office. Apartments are usually found in residential areas where there are less number of visitors and so they have the capacity to accommodate many people in their rooms while offices and clinics have people using them actively and rarely leave the place unoccupied for a while allowing people to sit comfortably in the arm chairs.

Thus, if a team scores with a score (a-b), it is given (a-b) points. For example, assuming that a team scored with an 8-0 difference over it's opponent, that team earned (8-0=8 points) and was given no point. Note that the tournament did not end in a draw. The other 8 points earned were not given. However, teams which earned a 1-point loss are eliminated and not continued in the game.\nIn the second round of games, again each team could score 1 or lose 1. During this round, however, a loss of (5-1)=4 points is sufficient. A team does not have to lose the match. The last round of the game produces the finalists.

A populated area is a city that has many shops and people in it (a shopping mall). A city can be found in a shopping mall. To get more actors, there is no need to pay them because most people will be happy to get on stage without money (a theater). Theaters don't usually pay the actors just for acting, because they are not really paid, but get payed from money coming from ticket sales. It is my opinion that the best place to find an actor would be a military base, then a shopping mall, because people usually don't get paid for their part in a theater. Theater people don't normally need a lot of audience people. A new theater could have unpaid actors. Theater people get paid little. Theater people have a job at a military base and take their pay, but have no time for their own job because they are undercover at a theater, on the set; then get off set and make the pay.\n\n### Answer:A: shopping mall\n\n### Input I would've come up with:E:military base\n\n### Demand:\n#### How do you feel about your response?\n\n### My response was pretty good.\n\n### The student has a lot of room for improvement.

The man has to buy from a dedicated home furnishing store such as Ikea, Kitchen Cabinets, or similar. It is not likely that he is going to find flooring at the grocery store, the pharmacy, the hardware store, etc.\n\n### Explanation:\nThere are many stores that sell flooring these day. From large department stores to small, specialized stores and online business, there is a lot of variety. We are looking for a man who needs to buy home flooring. The most common places a man will look to buy home flooring is either the local department stores or the local furniture stores. The man may want to keep things consistent and look at one store only for his shopping so he knows for sure what he is buying. He may also not realize that there are smaller flooring stores in his area and look at department stores because they are located on main roads and hard to miss. The final issue many man have when it comes to buying flooring is that they are often not accustomed to shopping on their own in a variety of places for the lowest price. They may end up buying the first thing they can find and don't have any idea that they are paying too much for the product. However, the man looking for home flooring already knows what he wants so this should be somewhat minor as he does not want to go into the house and find something that is off.

Your target: the biggest, most powerful kingdom.  To steal it, you must enter its castle and steal its treasure.  The castle is surrounded by walls, some of which are topped with guards.  The castle is made up of 10 floors and 100 rooms.  The walls and guards are evenly spread around these 10 floors/rooms, and no two are on the same floor.  There are no doors between rooms on the same floor. It is easy for you to steal every room on a floor except for one.  That room is on the floor closest to the entrance.  This room is on the opposite side of the castle from the one on which your room sits.  The rooms are shaped like dice, as shown.  The room on the opposite side of your room is connected to your room by a hallway.  Your room is on floor 9, so you are closest to the stairs that lead up to the entrance. You are at the bottom floor and must exit to the entrance. You cannot stay on the same floor as the room you must steal, or a guard will get you.  You cannot hide in a guards room if they know you are there, so it's never a good idea to hide.  Your room is not next to the room you are trying to steal, which means you must travel through several rooms to get there, and therefore spend enough time to be caught.

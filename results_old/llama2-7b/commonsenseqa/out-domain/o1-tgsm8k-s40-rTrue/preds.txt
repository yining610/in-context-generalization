A number of subspecies also exist, all of which vary in terms of size, markings and coat thickness. Foxes are opportunistic hunters, eating fruits, nuts, small vertebrates, and carrion wherever they can find it.<n><n>Foxes are often believed to be fox-like dogs, but these two animals are completely different. While dogs do have some wild relatives like wolves, foxes are not members of the canine species and, accordingly, are not considered by some to be a true wild animal. The majority of foxes also have a much smaller body mass, making their overall physical size much less imposing than that of a dog." -  https://www.thoughtco.com/description-of-the-fox-136867<n><n><n>#### Choices D and E are incorrect because:<n>A fox is not searching for a storybook or a henhouse.<n><n><n>### Instructions:Answer the two questions with complete sentences<n><n>### Question 1:<n>In math, is there anything that is true about every number?<n><n>### Question Rationales:<n>Yes, there is always one true answer out of every math problem that was given.

Choices:  A: excitement B: fatigue C: anger D: hurting E: getting tired<n><n>### Response:		I picked D-hurting because that is what happened at 7:00 AM. When the clock hit 7:00, i had to come up with ideas on how to get the exercise out in the morning that i usually get after school. I wanted to stay inside and make my 800 words. But then i started thinking, if i never got any exercise then what kind of life would i have. If i have an unhealty body, then i'm not going to be a great person at all. <n>When the time hit 11:00, i decided to go to the park and workout from 11:06-11:18. Whenever, i run i usually get tired really quick with my body. When i started exercising, i was having to breathe fast just like the dog did in the video. I ran to a tree and did some crunches, stretched, and took a minute to rest my stomache out.  I then finished the rest of my walking.<n><n>### Input<n>How will we ever know enough? There are infinite facts we could learn. Even the smallest amount of knowledge feels incredibly overwhelming when we consider all there is to know. If an endless stream of facts could solve the problem, just like one more drink could solve an alcoholic's problem, what would prevent us from drinking ourselves to death? <n><n><n>### Demostration<n>There are four ways to get the infinite facts that you can possibly learn:<n>1-learn more languages<n>2-do something useful to the community or country<n>3-learn how to build a business and learn how to manage it<n>4- Learn to manage your time effectively.<n><n>### Response<n>The way to know everything is to learn things that you don't need to know. In order to do that, you need to be able to multitask and figure how to manage your time. This means you will need to learn how to organize your time and other things related to how to build a business. In order to learn how to find a solution on how to build a business, we need to know how to manage time. This is possible because we will need to work on learning on how to organize time effectively. If we keep following that procedure, we should eventually know everything there is to know.<n><n>###

When the federal government calculates taxable income for Social Security, they don't automatically include the cost of living adjustments given to employees, which can significantly impact their final paycheck amount.<n>Wages<n>The 50/30/20 rule dictates how much of an employee's total earning income can be taxed as "ordinary income" while other sources of income are taxable as "unearned" income and "capital gains." When this rule applies to wage income, the total amount you owe in taxes is determined by dividing the total amount earned by 100% and then multiplying the resulting number by your tax bracket rate. This rule does not apply in every situation; it only applies if it's your only source of earned income.<n>The wage-earning reduction is based on wages as a percentage of other types of income. Depending on the type of job, wages can be a small percentage of total income. As a result, most employees pay a higher rate of federal income tax than they would if they were paid in cash or another non-wage form like a salary.<n>Other Income<n>The employer deducted 25% of wages to equalize the total earning with all other income. The remaining 25% of other income is still taxed as income, which lowers the employee's taxable income to $12,700.<n>

This is because they both produce their own apples and would not be classified as an imported product. I would also not put C or D because Canada has no state, so that eliminates one and the USA has a lot of states. I would not put E because flowers would not be considered as an apple and therefore would not be classified. This only leaves two choices A and E. I will say the apple is from option E which is the state of Washington.<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>

Therefore we have 1 for every $3.25 of cheese.<n>What that means is $3.25/$1=>>3.25/$3.25=1/1 = 1<n>We have 1 cheese.<n>Since we have 1 for $3.25, what happens to the left over $.50? We have $1 for the cheese, but $3.25 in total. Therefore we have $.50 to spend for other things. We can use it to buy more cheese or we can use it to buy other things. We can't use all of it because we are getting $.50 cheese for every $.50 spent. The cheese is cheaper that way.<n>We have $.50 cheese, and that is for every $3.50 that we have to spend.<n>Our math so far:<n>$3.50/$1=>>3(.50)=1/1 = 3 cheese<n>We have cheese left, but there is still $0.50 cheese that we can spend. Let's say we buy another cheese with that $.50

Choices:  A: regret B: automobile accidents C: drunk driving D: talking nonsense E: talk intelligently<n><n>### Response:		There are two ways a person can be inebriated, either by alcohol or illicit drugs. In the case of Alcohol, the person is not himself/herself when drunk, because for him/her speech doesn’t feel like coming through the mouth, but through the mind. The tongue is not free, the person speaks what his mind feels is good enough to express or share with other people.<n><n>However, when talking non-sense, the person is totally unaware of what he is getting himself into. He speaks anything that comes to mind, not because the person is drunk; he just isn’t thinking rationally.<n><n>In the case of illicit drugs it’s not just any kind of drugs, it’s the same drug that makes the person forget himself/herself, and the person isn’t aware of what’s going on in this case too. The person becomes disoriented as well as non-coordinated at times. These effects are very difficult to control and for a long time. And the mind’s capability will be affected while speaking<n><n>### Input:$7<$9<n>Rationales: $7<$9<n>The expression "$7<$9" is mathematically equivalent to "$9>$7".<n>$7<$9 is true when you think about it in a mathematical way.

We know that dogs like to eat. I'll tell you if I tell you I am a dog that I am sure that you will take my pet for a walk or give me some food. You will do anything possible to save your pet.<n><n>### Output:You need five more pennies to make a nickel. Is that right?<n><n>### Input:-5<45<n>Rationales:-5<45 should be true, because of the fact that in subtraction it's not possible to subtract more from a given number than is possible to subtract, and also that 45 is a multiple of 5.

They are identical statements. The sum of 200 pounds in kilograms equals 90 kilograms. A 50-pound bag of potatoes makes the statement: "34 pounds in kilos plus 50 pounds in kilos equals 54 pounds in kilos". Similarly, the statement "32 kilos plus 70 pounds equals 54 pounds" is a true statement.<n>The weight of a 34-pound potato is equal to the weight of 34 pounds in kilograms. The weight of 32 pounds is equal to the weight in kilograms. Therefore, the statement that "(34 pounds in kilogram plus 50 pounds of potatoes equals 54 pounds of potatoes)" is true.<n>A:The correct answer is (C) because they are exactly the same. For example, (34 pounds in kilo plus 50 pounds equals 50 pounds in pounds) and (34 pounds in a kg = 34 pounds is the same 34 pounds).<n><n>### Input<n>A:What is the missing link among A:17.1249, B:18.1251, C:1.1249?<n>B:C D:B<n><n>C:B&C&A  A:A&C<n>E:B<n><n>D:B: 1.5 - 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.4525<n>C:C: 0.6 + 0.6252<n>B:C: 0 - A<n>A:C: 0<n>E:B-C+A<n><n>answer: D:<n><n>I added<n><n><n>### Input 2<n>I can't find a good answer or solution to the input, anyone have idea if I miss?<n><n>Input: 1+2 is the same as 3/4.<n><n>Answer:<n>Is A because it is not the same with 3/4.

Since the object is on the floor there would not be a straight line since the line would have to be at an angle. The shortest angle of travel would go around the object. That is the smallest amount of travel since it must go around every point the person is away from the wall.<n><n>### Response <n>There is no shortest distance to the object. There would be a straight line but it would go over the wall and would not be shortest anymore.<n><n>### Task<n>1.

Choices:  A: celebrate B: have party C: hear crowd go mad D: create success E: reproduce<n><n>### Response:		<n>What would be considered a failure when attempting procreation is not hearing a crowd go insane and not creating a success. Therefore, we would call the outcome of successful procreation as the option of 'create a success'.<n><n>### Outputs:<n><n>```<n>Success is a success<n>Failure<n>```<n><n>### Input 2:<n>What should be done if the number of pennies in the dish is not divisible by 3? Choices: A: take out pennies and put back into the dish B: throw the pennies back in the dish C: return penny dish to the counter D: continue as is, you cannot return pennies to the dish E: leave the pennies in place and wait 5 days.<n><n>### Response 2:<n>If the dish with pennies is not divisible by three, take out only one penny at a time or get rid of pennies and get new ones. If a person decides for the alternative option which is to 'put back into the dish' the dish with pebbles cannot be returned to its place, because there is already a dish with pennys inside. The dish cannot be a dish with pebles and pennys at the same time. If we keep pebles and pebles at the same time we would have pebles, pennys and the dish, because one should remain with the pennys and another with pebles the third is the dish. Another alternative would be putting the dish with pebbels into a bag and taking one out with each option, this would probably take longer than the first option. There are only three options to add to the pebbles, one would be adding the one pebble with the option 'one penny'.<n><n>### Input<n>Input: You are walking east.

For each choice, choose one of the following as your response to the question: true, false, or cannot say. Write your response to each question in a separate answer. Explain your reasoning as completely as you can.  <n>During each round of the quiz, the computer will randomly  select a new question from Question 1 through Question 5 and will display the question to all users. At this time, a message announcing the round number and question number will appear on all connected terminals; the message will also describe the types of responses  available for each question. The response choice, “Cannot say,” is given as a way to allow you to demonstrate your thought processes as they relate to your reasoning, not as a means of evading a difficult situation.  <n>Note that although the questions and response choices are selected by computer, this quiz will be graded in much the same  way that a test would be graded by an instructor.

Symphony is also a group of musicians with Cello players, thus it is not the answer. Bands don't have cello, and therefore bands cannot be added to A. Likewise the same goes for symphonies. Music store is a place where musicians go to buy their instruments (ex. Flutes, etc.). Therefore it is not the answer either. Lastly, E can be ruled out for the same reasons. Therefore, the possible solutions are A and B<n>

Three fall off.  Now there are X apples."  What is this an example of? Choices:  A: park B: coloring book C: garden center D: math problem E: gravity<n><n>### Response:		<n>In order for the answer to be a coloring book, the problem needs to relate to the action of coloring. X has to have something to do with the color choices in the coloring book. This is an example of a math problem because it involves numbers that are subtracted from one another instead of a color choice. The answer is E. Gravity. Because the book includes a story within mathematics in terms of gravity. An apple that was once on the apple tree but "now" is on the table is used as an example of the gravity of things that are now different to the time they were on the apple tree.<n><n>### Response:"Five less than three tiles in a row.

Choices:  A: buy athletic equipment B: city C: espn D: town E: jerseys<n><n>### Response:		Finding the number of sporting goods store in a region is not the most important task in this scenario. Since this problem is a multiple choice question, we should look for the answer that sounds as closest as possible to the question. I will respond to all response because in the multiple choice scenario, there is only one correct answer and the rest are wrong answers.<n><n>Let's first ask ourselves: **buy athletic equipment**, **city**, **espn**, **town**, **jerseys**<n><n>**buy athletic equipment:** We can visit one of our local sporting good store and purchase whatever merchandise we want. For example, a basketball player might be looking for the proper shoe so he would visit a store, buy a pair of shoes.<n><n>**city:** Since city is part of athletic equipment, we can consider cities as part of the answer.<n><n>**espn:** We can watch the game on ESPN but we wouldn't be the player.<n><n>**town:** We might see a town on the broadcast when we watch our sport game on ESPN. However, in this question, we can't exclude this as an answer.<n><n>**jerseys:** we wear our jersey when we play the game. We do not visit a store specifically to buy our jersey. We usually purchase our jerseys at our local sporting goods store, but I wouldn't consider this as an answer. Since the question is only asking for the number of sporting good stores, the best answer to pick is a store or city.<n><n>If there a city with hundreds of sporting goods stores, it would be New York.<n><n>### Input:[<n><n>[<n>{<n>"name": "juguetes-y-games"<n>},<n>{<n>"name"": "juguete-de-navegador"<n>},<n>{ <n>"name":"tallaje-del-pandilla"<n>},<n>{ "name": "jugando-porn"<n>},<n>{   "name": "gaming-pcs"<n>},<n>]<n>]<n><n>### Response:[<n><n>[<n>[<n>"juguete-navegador",<n>"juguetes-i games",<n>"tallaje-del",<n>"gaming-d p

The sum of three even numbers is always even, meaning the sidewalk must be 3 inch long because an odd+odd sum = even<n>One other thing I notice is theres a car coming from the street.

The red light starts with the 3rd indentations. To get the approximate distance I have to subtract 2 inches from the distance I have from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd indentations, which is 7. The 5th indentation must be less than 1 inch away from the car. That would mean the total estimated distance to the car is 7+5=12 in <n>####<n>### Choices for Sum :<n><n>The number of indents in a series is odd.<n>Therefore the series must have an even sum such as (S+S+S)+C equals S*(S+1)/2.<n>In this case S=<<5>> and C=<<3>>, meaning we have to find S*(S+1)<n>S*

Choices:  A: restaurant B: congress C: envelope D: mail box E: cheese store<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>### Input:"If you took the number of legs off the number of spiders, the spiders wouldn’t have legs. The spiders have two or more legs, so subtracting the number of legs will not help. Now let’s remove another digit and subtract all the letters!"<n><n>### Demonsftration:<n>Let's say a number is n and spiders have n legs.<n><n>If you took the number or legs off the number of legs, it would be left with 0<n><n>Since the spiders have 2 or more, the number of legs is greater than 0. This means that the number of legs will be greater than the number of spiders to subtract, so taking the legs off will not help.<n>By removing another digit and subtracting the letters, you have to get to 0 (or less). For example(This will fail):<n>10002-2<n><n>10022-8<n><n>10222-4<n><n>20022-6<n><n>**Note: We have to get to 2, which is impossible. The way we do this with fractions is by multiplying by the lowest common denominator**<n><n>### Demosntration:<n><n>## Input:"If you take the number of spiders off the number of letters, the spiders could still have any number of legs. The letters have two or more of them, so removing the letters won’t help."<n><n><n>## Demonstration: You can't determine the number of spiders (or legss) without a denominator. For example:<n><n>15 letters-6<n><n>15letters-5<n><n>15 letters+5==6<n><n>In all the cases except the last one, letters and spiders have the same values, and adding one won't matter, since you'll have no way to tell if it should go to the left or the right.<n>In the case where you take away a letter, then the right part of your equality will be less than two, making two, so the inequality will hold, and you will get the number of letters, which is six.<n>Since 2 is smaller than 6, you know that this is how many letters, but you still don't know how many spiders.<n><n>To solve

In this question, the author describes a task for which we need to write a response. This response has instruction, demonstration, and the last one is the input. The instructions for this question are written in the sentence "Demonstration:". In this demonstration, the expression "+", "-" and "*" are being used as operators. We write the "demo" like this, "55" for an equation of the form "a+b=c". We also use the expression "Answer:". So this demonstration represents a math equation. We write the equation in the way that the first three letters are "Input:". An equation in English does not necessarily represent a full statement but rather an information that helps us find an answer. Then, we write our answer ("55"). So the answer is the answer to the math equation, not necessarily the answer to the question. The other two sentences are there as extra information or an explanation of the demonstration. A summary: (1) there is the question and it contains a "math equation" (which is a demonstration) and there will be (2) the answer.<n><n>### Notes<n>- The first sentence of the question and the first sentence of the demonstration are the same. In this case, the answer to the instruction is "55".<n>- Since there is no explicit mention that this demonstration is about the arithmetic, I take a wild guess and then test out solutions by inputting the guess. Since I take this guess, I assume the last sentence is an explanation.<n>## Solutions 2<n>1. The instruction:<n>```<n>Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n>```<n>2. Demonstration: In order to answer the following question, we need to solve the following equation:<n>```<n>55 <n>```<n>3. Solution: Since there is no explicit information that this is an arithmetic question, we can guess one possible solution that is a number. We will write out the solution with the demonstration written out before.<n>```<n>+<n>```<n>```<n><n>60<n>```<n>55<n>```<n>4. The equation includes "55".

This is because 100 is the 4th term divided by 1. To find the number of times the 4th terms is 100, divide the 4th number 100 by 1. You will get 1. Thus, 1 is the number of times the series is 100 to form the initial term, 1. You can also multiply the number of times by the sum of the numbers in the series. If you multiply by the sum of the series, you get 174.<n><n>### Example Output<n><n>### Instructor:<n>A new caterer opened her business on main street.

'See work' is a verb, meaning it can be a sentence on its own. This means that the question is 'What did he see when he touched the exposed wires?'<n><n>Because 'hurt yourself' is a phrase rather than a verb and because it does not have the capacity to stand on its own, it must be replaced by see work.<n><n>

Choices:  A: alabama B: louisiana C: south carolina D: arkansas E: mountains<n><n>### Response:		The input: "if one sees a fox in a coastal gulf state, where one is" seems like the description to a riddle or some other kind of word problem.<n><n>Let's break it down. First, the if one sees is a predicate expression that tells you that the following is true with respect to fox(x). The truth of that predicate is then determined by some information about the predicate. The predicate is not true if one does not first encounter a fox. However, when the predicate is true, the predicate information must also include an indication that that person is in a coastal, but not mountainous, gulf state. There are two major gulf coast states that are coastal (Alabama and Louisiana), and three that are not coastal (Arkansas, Mississippi, and South Carolina). Thus, we can determine that if one sees a fox one is in one of the coastal gulf states: Alabama, or Louisiana. However, one is not in the mountainous states Arkansas or South Carolina, and one also is not in the non-coastal non-mountainous states Mississippi or Oklahoma.<n><n>Therefore, if one sees a fo, one is in a coastal gul, which means one is in Alabama or Louisiana. <n><n>### Input:"Rank the objects in the following list from largest to smallest. (This problem is a classic programming task.)"<n><n>### Response:"The standard practice in terms of computer programming is to start with the first item as the largest. Starting with that, I would assume that the second will be the largest, and so on. That would mean that 1=largest and 7=smallest."<n><n>### Input<n>"Which of these is greater 2,4 or 13?"<n>### Response<n>If 2 is greater than 4, then that would mean the difference between 4 and 2 is 2. If that were that case, then it would mean the answer is either 15 or 14.

In elementary school I would get my homework done right away and hand it in. In middle school I would turn it in right next to last because of a certain project that was important in middle school. Junior year I only did a little bit of my homework right away and turned it in when  I felt like it was completely finished. When I first started high school I was behind on my grades so during first semester I had to go through a lot of work and stay up late in the morning working on things a few weeks in advance. I stayed up a lot that semester and got behind on my social life. The second semester my teachers were giving homework late and I turned my homework in the week afterwards.<n>##### B) What did you learn about writing and math from your experience?<n>I feel like I learned to write out assignments on paper and use highlighters instead of a laptop because if I use my laptop I get distracted by other tabs, which ends up taking me longer to finish my homework. I like to use highlighters because they are colorful and easy to read. During writing classes we talked about the format of an essay, if it was from the past it would include a title, thesis, body and conclusion. The math I have learned about writing out my math problems is to do the hardest part and then slowly add in. This has helped me because the first step for me is always to calculate the answer and see the answer I got.<n>##### C) Describe any similarities and differences between your high school and class.<n>My high school is a lot different than this class because in my class the teachers are more lenient and they don’t expect you to memorize things when given homework and they expect you to have a conversation with them when you’re struggling. In my class they treat high school students like

Choices:  A: dicks sporting goods B: sporting event C: mall D: sears E: sporting goods store<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Why:Sickle cell disease usually doesn’t cause symptoms until its later stages. It can cause severe pain during a crisis called a “sickle cell crisis.” You have symptoms of sickle cell crisis when sickled red blood cells block small blood vessels throughout your body. This blocking causes pain. You may have swollen, tender hands and feet. But you may have other signs and symptoms in other areas of your body, too.<n><n>#### Sickle cell crisis: A sudden and severe episode of pain caused by severe disease complications or red blood cell blockages. Pain may begin in one part of the body and spread. Certain factors may increase your risk of a sickle cell crisis. They include dehydration, high altitude, low oxygen pressure and stress.<n><n>#### Why: If it has been a while between crises, then a person may not realize they have sickle cell disease. Sometimes when a crisis occurs the patient will just blame the pain on the last crisis. However, it is important to remember that a sickle cell crisis does not always occur with each other. If the patient is not taking the medication or have not treated their sickle cell disease well then they may have the symptom. They should also tell the doctor what drugs that they use. A person with sickle cell disease may have a crisis that may be related to something that they ate or it could be due to an infection. A doctor will diagnose a person if they have had a crisis in the past and then they will continue treatment after this.<n><n>#### Why not: If a person has the disease it may cause a lot of pain in their body. Then they will have an ache for a certain period of time. After this time the person will not have any problem for a certain period of pain. They will feel the pain and then it go away after a certain period of time or they may not even be feeling the pain anymore. They may feel the pain on the side or it could be in the stomach or even the back. After a while, it will go away and then, the person will not feel anything.<n><n>#### Why both: The symptom could occur due to high altitude or stress. If you go up there, you will feel tired and it will be hard for you to breathe, then the sickle cell crisis will be occur. Stress can

I'll also go ahead and post my response to the task here.<n><n><n>**Post: 5 (Jeremy):**<n><n>I think the instructions are wrong in several places.  First, the variable should be s, even though it is used (in the 2nd example) as a number (s=55).  I also think that the second example should say 31 rather than 55, again using the correct variable.  I'm also a bit confused, but going to guess the answer to s is Schnauzers.<n><n>![Schlitz](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oXRv8mfk01bK63MzK/giphy.gif)<n>

If the person has blue eyes now, what would be the probability distribution of this blue-eyed person?<n><n>The 50% means that there are only 6,214(50%) people who have blue eyes, in which case we have 50:6,214= <<50:6,144>><n>This means there are 50 blue-eyed friends who have the same probability of chosing themselves with 50:6214<n><n>### Questions:<n>What is the probability of rolling a four or an eight on two six-sided dice?<n><n>### Answers:<n>```R: <n>    if mod(n,c)==0<n>        0<n>else<n>    sum[list(repeat(n) * 2^(mod(n, c)) )]<n>```R<n>```Python<n>if k %=6:<n>    return k<n>else:<n>    return sum([x ^ k/(8**(k // 2)) for x in range(8)])<n>```Python<n><n>```<n>Input: The probability of rolling a four is 2/6, which equals 1/3=<<26/62>>1/3, the probability of rolling an eight is 4/6, which equals to 5/12=<<2>>5/12, since the sum=<<1/3+5/12>>1/12, which equals 12/36, which equals 2/9=<<2/9>>

Choices:  A: teach B: cost money C: do work D: be productive E: help people<n><n>### Response:		The question was not clear or complete.<n><n>### Input<n>1.The total productivity of an organization depends on multiple factors. Many people associate a lack of workplace privacy with an improved work environment. When employees work in an office rather than their home, they are less likely to suffer from stress and burnout. 2.Many people associate a lack of space with distractions from the workplace. Workplace privacy should be a concern for every professional because private work spaces can boost productivity and employee satisfaction. 3.The productivity of our firm, which is one of the leading technology businesses, relies on several elements. What role does office privacy play in the workplace? To begin with, employees who work from home usually do so out of necessity, while those who work in an office environment do so by choice. 4.Employee dissatisfaction is frequently linked to a lack of privacy. 5.The average office worker can lose productive time in four places, including the following:  I. The average office worker spends three hours each week searching for and digging through the information. III. The average office worker is distracted by at least ten people every day. IV. Lack of privacy in the office makes it difficult for employees to interact with co-workers and focus on their work. V. Poor office privacy also prevents an office worker from relaxing during breaks and from focusing on work during personal time. 6.The office space is an employee's second-largest work expense. It is important to consider privacy in hiring, office design, and training. 7.One of the most significant benefits of working from home is that you don't have to pay travel fees. 8.According to research, working at home can increase productivity by 8-16%, while increasing job satisfaction by 13-37%. 9.Many office workers believe that workstation design is the same as ergonomics. Workplace privacy is crucial because privacy is a critical component of good ergonomics in the workplace. 10.Office workers' productivity is negatively impacted by factors such as noise and distractions. 11.According to research by the International Data Corporation (IDC), 20-35% of workspace is wasted. 12.Lack of space for work

Building sites would be poor choices as well; if they're being excavated, then the site can't be used as a building. Finally, there would be no reason to excavate near a cemetary or city unless you were looking to explore its history.<n><n>### Input How did the British Empire gain India in 1856?

Choices:  A: doctor's office B: hospital C: apartment D: study E: furniture store<n><n>### Response:		<n>In a hospital, the doctor's office is the one place where people do not sit in the arm chair.<n>### Conception:<n>In hospitals people do not take a seat to the doctors’ offices because they use their time seeing the doctor and not resting in the seats. The doctors always have the chairs occupied with patients who are visiting them.<n><n>### Response Rationale:<n><n>### In Hospital  _D_<n><n>A hospital contains many people who are uncomfortable with sitting in the armchairs. Many things happen in hospital settings that might involve someone falling ill or getting injured or under-going any medical procedure thus hospitals have many people visit to the various clinics and doctors’ offices. The doctors always take priority in getting the arm chairs occupied with their patients and leaving other people waiting outside the room. The only time these armchairs are going unoccupied is when the doctor’s room is unoccupied or when a doctor leaves the office. Apartments are usually found in residential areas where there are less number of visitors and so they have the capacity to accommodate many people in their rooms while offices and clinics have people using them actively and rarely leave the place unoccupied for a while allowing people to sit comfortably in the arm chairs. Therefore, the answer is a doctor's office.<n><n>### Concepts/Skills:<n>This task focuses on the use of critical and logical thinking which helps a person analyze a situation or task and decide the appropriate next step.<n>### Question:When can you determine whether or not a square is a trapezoid or a parallelogram?<n><n>### Demostration:<n><img src="images/instructions/3.png"/><n><n>### Demosration Rationale:<n><img src="/images/instructions-3"><n><n>### Response<n><n>If a square is a trapezium then<n><n>$\begin{cases}  A +  B +  C +  D < \left(A + C + B + D\right) \\ \text{Or}   $ If  A +  B < \left(C + D\right), then A + B + C + D = < ABCD<n><n>### Thinking Behind the Concept:<n><n>### Question:Describe the

There were 16 participating teams and the first round of games produced 8 teams. During this round, each team could score only 1 point and each team could lose only 1 point. Thus, if a team scores with a score (a-b), it is given (a-b) points. For example, assuming that a team scored with an 8-0 difference over it's opponent, that team earned (8-0=8 points) and was given no point. Note that the tournament did not end in a draw. The other 8 points earned were not given. However, teams which earned a 1-point loss are eliminated and not continued in the game.<n>In the second round of games, again each team could score 1 or lose 1. During this round, however, a loss of (5-1)=4 points is sufficient. A team does not have to lose the match. The last round of the game produces the finalists. In this round, each team can only score no more than 1 point or win up to 3 points over its opponent. If a team is given

A populated area is a city that has many shops and people in it (a shopping mall). A city can be found in a shopping mall. To get more actors, there is no need to pay them because most people will be happy to get on stage without money (a theater). Theaters don't usually pay the actors just for acting, because they are not really paid, but get payed from money coming from ticket sales. It is my opinion that the best place to find an actor would be a military base, then a shopping mall, because people usually don't get paid for their part in a theater. Theater people don't normally need a lot of audience people. A new theater could have unpaid actors. Theater people get paid little. Theater people have a job at a military base and take their pay, but have no time for their own job because they are undercover at a theater, on the set; then get off set and make the pay.<n><n>### Answer:A: shopping mall<n><n>### Input I would've come up with:E:military base<n><n>### Demand:<n>#### How do you feel about your response?<n><n>### My response was pretty good.<n><n>### The student has a lot of room for improvement.

Choices:  A: music shop B: music store C: jug band D: united states E: among nice people<n><n>### Response:		<n>The banjo finds it’s history in the Carribean. The United States.<n>The Carribean had one of the largest populations of slaves from Nigeria and many places around Africa, meaning many African people had influence on music and instruments in the Caribbean. That's probably where the banjo started to become popular. The United States made a type of banjo called the bluegrass. Bluegrass was also called "old-time" music that was played mostly by farmers and their families, as well as jug bands. That's why the bluegrass is called a jug band because it's a type of music played by people making less money. There are more jug bands in America than anywhere else in the world because of the bluegrass that came to America with African slaves. Jug band music is also an American jazz style that originated in the early 1900s.<n><n>#### B<n><n>#### C<n><n>#### D<n><n>#### E<n><n>#### The United States.<n><n>>

Choices:  A: walmart B: loft C: house D: home depot E: kitchen<n><n>### Response:		<n>Choice: A: walmart<n><n>Explain the correctness of your answer: Home Depot and Walmart do not stock home flooring. The man has to buy from a dedicated home furnishing store such as Ikea, Kitchen Cabinets, or similar. It is not likely that he is going to find flooring at the grocery store, the pharmacy, the hardware store, etc.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>There are many stores that sell flooring these day. From large department stores to small, specialized stores and online business, there is a lot of variety. We are looking for a man who needs to buy home flooring. The most common places a man will look to buy home flooring is either the local department stores or the local furniture stores. The man may want to keep things consistent and look at one store only for his shopping so he knows for sure what he is buying. He may also not realize that there are smaller flooring stores in his area and look at department stores because they are located on main roads and hard to miss. The final issue many man have when it comes to buying flooring is that they are often not accustomed to shopping on their own in a variety of places for the lowest price. They may end up buying the first thing they can find and don't have any idea that they are paying too much for the product. However, the man looking for home flooring already knows what he wants so this should be somewhat minor as he does not want to go into the house and find something that is off. These are the most likely places a man would look for home flooring.<n><n>

If I got bored, I would change the station or turn it off. I get pleasure because I am doing something, so, if I don't get pleasure I think it would be from boredom. If I'm watching tv to get fat or sad it means I don't like it and I would turn it off or change station, meaning I don't actually want to be there. If I were there because it is the only thing to do and I don't get any pleasure then it would be a choice  B: entertained.

Choices:  A: inspiration B: much work C: boredom D: graduate E: degree<n><n>### Response:		<n><n><n>The problem with this question is that it uses the word `Doberman` when `Doberman` actually refers to the name of the dog. The word `Doberman puppies` actually refers to the `Dobes`. (Note: The question states they are all puppies, which could refer to any category of dog, so it does not answer the question)<n><n>This question could easily be solved with a table.<n><n>|Dobes|Schnauzers|Graduating|Answer|<n>|---:|---:|---|---|<n>|20|?|90|55|<n>|?|20|90|70|<n>|100|?|98|100|<n>|?|100|100|88|<n>|?|?|98+90+98+90|194|<n><n>When you solve the problem this way, you will notice that the answer to the question is 100 but your answer does not really affect the question.

One way to make new friends is by introducing yourself, as you have done by introducing yourself in the Schnauzer club, which I saw you join on the website, by the way. Another way is to meet people, you can meet more people by having small talk, you can also meet lots of people in the Schnauzers club by mingling and talking to the other members after that. Another way to make new friends quickly is by meeting in groups because you may know someone in the group that can then introduce you to others, if not you may be friends with that person.<n><n>#### 50<n>Answer: Introduce yourself then mingle with the Schnauzertalk group by talking to them at their events<n><n>---<n>© 2022 Trilogy Education Services, LLC, a 2U, Inc. brand.

Or you could choose B, and then explain how he travels to Texas for steak-house food. Or you could choose C, and then explain why the building is not a steak-house. Or you could choose D, but it's probably not the best answer because it's about food.  So your only remaining choice is E.<n><n>#### 50<n>Answer: D<n><n>### Input::You are a master thief, and the greatest thief who has ever lived. You are known as ThiefMaster.  Your target: the biggest, most powerful kingdom.  To steal it, you must enter its castle and steal its treasure.  The castle is surrounded by walls, some of which are topped with guards.  The castle is made up of 10 floors and 100 rooms.  The walls and guards are evenly spread around these 10 floors/rooms, and no two are on the same floor.  There are no doors between rooms on the same floor. It is easy for you to steal every room on a floor except for one.  That room is on the floor closest to the entrance.  This room is on the opposite side of the castle from the one on which your room sits.  The rooms are shaped like dice, as shown.  The room on the opposite side of your room is connected to your room by a hallway.  Your room is on floor 9, so you are closest to the stairs that lead up to the entrance. You are at the bottom floor and must exit to the entrance. You cannot stay on the same floor as the room you must steal, or a guard will get you.  You cannot hide in a guards room if they know you are there, so it's never a good idea to hide.  Your room is not next to the room you are trying to steal, which means you must travel through several rooms to get there, and therefore spend enough time to be caught.  However, you have 1 minute to steal every other room on the castle.  You always have at least 2 minutes to steal the room in which you live. You

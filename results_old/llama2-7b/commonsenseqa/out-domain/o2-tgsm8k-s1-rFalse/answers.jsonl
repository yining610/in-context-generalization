Recently in this company the managers realized that only half of their old phones that come in to the company were actually put back out in to the community for other to use. These old phones contain tons of useful metals that could be sold for a good price. All of the old phones that come into the company have a phone code on it that describes how much metals there are in the phone. This year the company is determined to sell all the phones they get in within these numbers to the highest bidder. It was decided that if the company could sell their phones within the phone codes then this will be considered recycling. The manager of the company decided on giving a price of $5/hour to the person putting the phones in to the program. Since they had some employees that could do the job some employees had to take cuts in hours to fit in the program. The manager did not have enough phones at the end of the day so he had to hire five part time employees to finish out the day. If the phones the part time employees got the manager wanted paid $32/hour. \nThe manager wants to determine how many of the original employees should be kept on after the program while making sure the program still goes forward. Each employee who was not able to keep their original hour amount will get hired as a part time employee.\n\n### Assumptions:\nAssumptions: I would think that a good assumption for this question would be that since the company is working towards recycling more phones because they have a new program", "answer": "B: late for work"}

Provide 3 different path solutions.\n\n### Response 1:\nThere are a few different path solutions to a 10x5 rubik's cube:\n1. You could start with your center layer facing up, top layer to the left, and the right layer upside down(R/ U' R,R'/ U')\n2. You could start with the middle two layers upside down(U U',U' L U)\n3. You could start with all of the layers upside down(UL U' U' L U U' L U' U L)\n\n\n### Response2:\nThere are a lot of different path solutions for a 10 x 10 rubik's cube. For example, you can make one layer upside down(U L), then do the R' R,R' R moves, then do the U' R, R' U' moves, and finally you can do the R' R',  R  moves, and finally you're done. You could also start with the outside layers facing up and then do the U' U, U' U moves, then the R' R' moves, then the R movies. You could also start the middle layer facing up and starting doing U' L, U B R' U moves, or U' L, B R' U, or U' L B R' U. Basically, the more complicated something gets, the more difficult it is to solve.\n\n###Response 3\nAll there are three methods for solving a rubiks\u2019 cube is:\n\n###Method 3\nThere are two ways to solve a 10x3 rubik's cube, both involving the \"cubicle\" algorithm. This is how you solve it when the middle layer faces up and the outermost layer faces down.\nFirst, turn your cube so that the middle layer faces down, and all other layers face up. Then do the steps \"up' 'R' 'R',\" \"U' L' U' L\", \"R' 'L\" and \"U' U' U' L\".

C: The bouncy ball flew into the air into the sky. d) The boat fell so low that the people on it were drowning. D: Ate the food right away.\n\n### A)What's the difference between \"on the surface\" and \"afloat\"?\n\nAn object at the surface is floating. On the surface suggests more movement than afloat, e.g. \"It appeared to be floating on the surface of the water.\"\n\n### B)What does \"airborne\" mean?\n\nSomething airborne is floating - in the air. I think that your example was a typo, but see if it changes anything.\n\n### C)How do you know the cat \"hit\" the water? It might only have glanced off the surface.\n\nThe word _hit_ conveys the meaning of hitting something. But there may never have been any contact.\n\n### D)The child wasn't crying about being hungry - just _crying._\n\"Crying\" suggests no more information.\n\n### E)Explain why \"the bouncy ball flewing into the air\" is incorrect grammar.\n\nFlying into the air is an incorrect formulation. \"The bouncy ball flewed into the air\" would only be correct if _flewed_ were the past tense of the verb _flee_.\n\n### F)Explain why \"drowning people on the boat\" is incorrect.\n\nWhen people are drowning on a boat, they are standing on the boat. Drowning conveys the meaning that someone is not standing on the boat any longer.

(Enter your function.)\n#### Test Result:  A\n#### Test Input\nA:\n    If you were to ask the person\u2019s parents what they would expect from a child who gets all C\u2019s on every one of their report cards, they\u2019d expect a passing grade.  This is because a failing grade is an indictment.  They believe that a child who gets failing grades is not passing their school work.\n\nB:\n    If their school work is all C\u2019s, I would hope that that person believes that they are competent to pass high school.  The test expects a C.  Since the goal is to have a grade that shows a competency in one\u2019s school work.  But a bad grade does not in anyway prove a skill.\n\nC:\n        A better grade than that is an intellectual challenge.\n        To gain knowledge, there is challenge.  If there is not, the grade earned is not a sign of being competent in school work.\n\nD:\n    I believe a person getting a passing grade will only be painful if that person is a perfectionist and fails at being a perfectionist.  The stress this person is under is avoidable and the only real fear they have is to try to live up to a standard they set and can not achieve.\n\nE:\n        What the person gets is the only evidence that they are competent in your field.  A grade of A shows an intellectual challenge where the person can do better but does not necessarily need to.  A grade of B shows a higher level of intellectual challenge with respect to school work.  So the person would be competent in their field if they received a passing grade, since the person is expected to pass their school work.", "answer": "B: passing grade"}

How many shoes does Mary have?\n\n### Response\n\n    The correct answer is A: 12 shoes.\n   Answer:\nIf Mary has only red and blue shoes then she has 8 shoes. Next, if all these shoes are green and red then she's definitely left with 2 shoes. One can come to this conclusion by stating that it is impossible to count all the combinations because there are 17 distinct items and the number of possible combinations(2^17 or 2097152 combinations). One way to get the number of combinations is to write 10^4 which is the largest number less than 2^x. The above two arguments make it obvious that she has 12 shoes at the least.

Only those variables defined with var that are declared volatile are treated this way.  The difference is that variables defined with the let keyword cannot be assigned any new values at all. They can only be assigned values when they are initialized and they are not allowed to be modified again. This feature is called \"constant variables\"; which means they can get only a single value assigned to them.  This property is used for initializing variables as constant values, for example. The scope of variables declared with var is global and they can be accessed or used anywhere in the program. This feature is typically used when you do not need or even want to be sure about the value of the variable.   The scope of variables declared using let is confined to the same block in the program in which they were declared.\n\nAnswer: When a variable is declared as var, it means that the value of that variable is not yet determined, and they can be changed later.  When a variable is declared using let, it means that the variable\u2019s value has been determined at the point when you assigned it, and it can not be changed.", "answer": "B: getting bored"}

{"text": "In the problem 1, you're given a situation or scenario. You're asked to fill in missing values. So, you have to figure out how many large stickers she used, how many small stickers she used and the final number.\n\nIn the problem2, you're given some information: how much Zach saved, how many more money he need to buy the bike, his weekly allowance, his babysitting reward, and his parent will pay him an income. \n\nNow, how does that relate to the original problem? Zach is going to sell these two items to buy his bike. What's the math involved in this situation?\n\n### Response 2:\n\nIn the first problem 1, you are asked how many stickers remain. The problem stated how many large and small stickers she used. \n\nNow you're asked how many large stickers do she have. Large stickers are larger than small stickers.  She added 3 large stickers. So, you're given how many she used and how many remain, therefore, the total number of large stickers she used is 3. \n\nThe same concept applies to total number of small stickers she used = 7. So, when adding the values, 7 + 3 = 10. \n\n10 is your final answer. \n\nFor the second problem, you can see all the details were given and you're expected to calculate. \n\nZach saved $65 until now. He get $10 extra every week to mow the laundry. He'll earn extra $10 for every he babysits. \n\nTo buy a bike cost 100$. He must raise $8 more to buy the bike. \n\nFrom his weekly allowance he would get $10 for helping family/neighbors. \n\nIt will take more hours to mow the laudry. Babysitting will earn extra $7 per hours. \n\nZack still needs 4hrs and 10$ to buy his bike for a total of $64+$10+$7=$81. \n\nAnswer: The question you need to answer for the first problem is how many large stickers Mary used, or how many stickers she", "answer": "E: social bonding"}

How much would Zack have to save up to have $117 to buy a bicycle?\n\n-   First, let's think of the whole problem and what Zack actually wants to do.  We can write out what Zack need to do or complete in  mathematical terms.  This is referred to as what variable is needed to solve the entire problem. That is referred to as x.  Zack need to have the total amount of money to buy a bicycles; if Zack doesn't have enough money, he can't buy a bicycle.\n\n-    Zack has money that is just lying around not doing anything.  How do we refer to the money that Zack isn't using yet?\n\n-    The money has value; what is it?\n\n-    That value is called dollars.  So Zack has x dollars.  Now we need  another variable that will tell us how much Zack has earned for doing jobs.  We will refer to that as y.\n\n-   We will call the amount Zack has earned so far for doing jobs y.\n\n-    The problem asks: \"How much y do Zack have?\"  We will simply subtract his allowance and then add the extra dollars he earns.\n\n-    So we will use the following formula: y = x - a + b, where x is the money Zack has, a is the money Zack will be given, and b is the additional money Zack will earn.\n\n-    To find Zacks total, first we plug in the variable x:\n\n-    x = y - a + b; y = x - a - b\n\n-    Now, we replace x with 89:\n\n-    y = 89 - a - b\n-    Now replace a with an absolute value:", "answer": "B: applaud"}

Write a program to play against a Human player. You only need to be able to play against a single player. Assume that humans play at most once per iteration.\n\nA game starts with each player taking 9 turns. (The Human player plays first.) At the end of each player\u2019s turn, he/she may select either the O (circle in O) or X (circle in X) mark in a 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 grid. If a player draws a mark and leaves any unmarked 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 squares, his turn ends. The winner of a game is the first player to win three turns in a row.\n\n### Write a Program in Python to play the game against a Human.\n\n### Assumptions:\n- You are the computer and you will play all games unless you run out of memory or time, in which case you have to wait for the other player to move.\n- You can play at most once per round.\n- You can make decisions and play the game by typing a command into the commandline. The rest of the code should deal with the user interaction.\n    - You have to accept all other commands as input but print nothing out to the terminal. That means, a message like \"Goodbye\" will not work.\n    - All commands need to be followed by a newline or enter, so the human does not have to type them in all in one line.\n\n### Sample Input Syntax (you just need a human):\n\n```\n.\n.\n.\n> H \n> S\n> X\n> O\n```\n\n### Sample Output\n\n|Turn|.\n|------|\n> H\n> S\n>.\n>.\n> O \n  \n>.\n> T\n> O\n>.\n> H\n\n### Note\n\nDo", "answer": "C: pantry"}

I also think if you choose A it would be hard to get the money from there in a rush because of the time it would take. As for it being hard to get it from a cash drawer it is going to be harder to get it if you want it right away then if for say you needed 100 dollars a month. Also the cash drawer can be opened right away without a key because it can just be opened and has no lock on the drawer, so that is why it is easier to get the money out of.\n\n### Source:\nCourse: ISD 709\nClass: ELA 8", "answer": "B: piggy bank"}

{"text": "The correct answer is C.  Capillaries are tiny vessels found throughout the body tissue.  Any injury involving these structures can lead to bleeding.  \n\nIn a soccer game, players can get cut at times when the other team kicks or trips them, or simply when they come into contact with the ground or another player during the frenetic, fast-moving game.  In addition, the goalie must wear special thick gloves as part of the soccer gear.  Therefore, a goalie is unlikely to need stitches.\n\nIn animals (bees, for example, though they don't apply to this question), a stinger is meant to inject venom or another toxin, but humans do not have stingers and a bee's stinger is too large for a human's dermis.  Thus, a stinger is unlikely to leave a wound requiring stitches.\nMost sports that have been devised for human competitions don't involve fighting, beating down an opponent, kicking or punching, or other activities that could result in injuries requiring stitches.  The only possible exception we can think of would be boxing, but even that sport is regulated, so it's also unlikely to cause injuries so severe that you'd need stitches.", "answer": "A: soccer game"}

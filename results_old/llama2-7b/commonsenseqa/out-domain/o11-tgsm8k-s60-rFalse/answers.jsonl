Write a response to each of the following directives.\n\n### Directive: 1: \nIn the 1960's and mid 1970's, the US government had an active and expensive effort to promote immigration. One argument was that a country's prosperity would be enhanced by allowing highly skilled people to come work in the country. The government of the United States had a law called the H-1B. The law was to allow a large number of new employees to work in the US. Many people complained that the H-1B program was taking low-income jobs away from native-born Americans. \nWrite an essay that explains how to decide whether or not the H1B program was having the anticipated effect.\n\n### Example Essay:\nIn the 1060's and 70's a large number of immigrants flocked to the US, taking away many jobs from native US workers because of the H1B program. The amount of low income families going up because of the jobs lost was very low so it caused more harm for the native US citizens.\n\n### Written Response: \nIn the late 1960s and 1970s, the US government implemented an act called the H-1b program. This act allowed for foreigners to have easy access to jobs in the US and take the job away from the native born citizens. At that time many complained that the H1B program took away many jobs from the native born Americans. At first the H1B program allowed for many to come to the US and get jobs in the US that used to be held by native US citizens. However it created large number of low wage workers.

{"text": "Exercise. If you exercise, you should get energy out of it. This might be easier for a muscle-head, but if you are tired, it is the best thing to do.\n\n### Input\nYou should never waste time if you have 5 hours before your test.\n\n### Response\nI disagree with this statement. If you have 7 hours to study, you can waste time if you feel it is a waste of your time. Time wasting is usually wasteful when you have no time to do what you need to do. I also think that time \"feels\" wasted when you get it done in less than the time. Time in our society is based on the unit and measurement of dollars. \n\nIn terms of the 5-hour test, I see this statement as inaccurate in most cases. Some tests will take less time than 5 hours. Some tests will take more than 5 hours. The time is only an estimate of the expected time for the test. So, you should never waste time if there is no time limit because you can't accurately predict the time it would take you to complete the test. You should waste time because it is your time, and you can do whatever you please to accomplish what you want to get done.\n\n### You make an error in your work. If you catch this error quickly, then it won't be hard to fix.\n\n### Reponse\nBecause you've spent most of the day being busy, the idea of taking the day off is appealing to you.\n\n### Reply: \nI agree with this. Many people find it hard to take a day off because of being busy while doing work. If you are busy working, it is easy to neglect that you have a day off, and you should be resting. You may find that relaxing is harder because you are still busy and have to get work done. You should have days off, or you will get burned out of work.\n\n### Question: \nA: The average distance you drive per day in your car, in miles is x.\nHow could the statement be changed to avoid this?\nB:  One of the two lines contains a word that is repeated twice, once as one of the synonyms.

This means that if we put a specific input into a function, we will then get one specific output - this is called as a mapping.  For example, we can draw a mapping called \"number guessing game\" which tells us what would be our guess after we tell it how many guesses we should have. In the case of this function, for each input we put in, we would get a specific output.\n\n### Functions Example\n\nIn a game of Rock-Scissors-Paper, if a player's Rock beats another player's Paper, then there is a 33.3% chance that the second players Paper beats the first player's Scissors. There is only a 33.8% change that Paper wins the match and there is a 32.9% chance that Scissors wins a draw. In short, we can show the odds of winning as below and they are all functions because we have one output for each input given.\n\nA: Paper is 1,389.1 to 1 compared to Rock\n\nB: Scissors is 302.6 to 3 compared to Paper\n\nC: Rock is 644.2 to 1 compared to Scissors\n\nD: Paper is 7 to 2 compared to Scissors (if one player flips Paper before Scissors)\n\nE: Scissors is a 2 to 3 chance of a draw with (Paper,Scissors,Rock)\n\n### Input  : Which  of the following values is an example of exponentiation?

The idea of a task was to solve for a number in the context of an interesting and complex question and then answer with data that the students can relate to. In some of the examples, the correct response was based on an assumption that went unstated. For instance, there is no explanation in the task of what \"dull\" means. Or why there were no numbers associated with each individual character - like \"3 other people and 3 other individuals\". I think this adds in a layer of complexity - something that I think is a good idea as math is inherently about rigor rather than memorization.\n\n### Assessment\n\n---\n\n### Suggestions for improvement\n\n---\n\nI wanted to make sure that the tasks and how they are answered could be understood without additional materials.

In the 2016 election, the Republican party could only find a man to represent them. That would mean that if a woman ran as a Republican in 2018, she would be the party with no representation on the national ticket. But in 2016 there was a woman on the Republican national ticket. How is that possible?\n\n# 13:\n\nThe United States has two major political parties. One of them is the Republican Party. The other is the Democratic Party. When a person runs for president, one of them will run against that person. One of those parties is the Democratic Party. The other one is the Republican Party. If the Democratic Party wants to nominate its presidential candidate, it has to have a primary. There are three major states that hold primaries. They are Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. In the past few elections, Iowa held its primary earlier in February. New Hampshire and South Carolina have also held their caucuses and primaries earlier in the year. But this year, all three states are scheduling later primaries in order to save money. Why would they want to do that?\n# 14:\n\nA group of people in a certain country had a big problem. Two of the country's leaders had been in control for a long time. They decided to try to elect a new leader. A few people ran for president.

{"text": "Different Types of Flower Arrangement\n\nOne kind of flower arrangement is an overhanging or trailing bunch. This style is great for tall flowers like roses or gladiolus. A trailing arrangement consists of a single stem with flowers spilling over the edge of a bowl or vase.\n\nA second is a round bouquet. The flowers in this style are bunched together around a single or double stems, and then wrapped around a larger container. A very common style of round bouquet is made from roses.\n\nA third is a fan arrangement. Fan arrangements contain flowers spanning from the top to the bottom of the container, forming the shape of a fan. Fan arrangements are great for tall flowers and are often decorated with short-stemmed flowers to bring up the height of the composition.\n\nA fourth is an overgrown container planting. In this style, the flowers are planted in the same container in which they will remain all summer. This style of arrangement is used in outdoor spaces, such as along a sidewalk or at a gate. Containers are great for brightening up a small area of a yard or garden.\n\nA fifth is an oblong arrangement. This style contains flowers positioned in a long way, with flowers arranged evenly in the oblong. This style of arranging flowers includes flowers such as daisies and lilies, which have long, thin stems.\n\n<img src=\"../../.gitbook/assets/2.jpg\" alt=\"2.jpg\" style=\"zoom:75%;\" />\n\nA sixth is a wreath arrangement. In a wreath style, flowers are arranged around a circular wreath, and often contain foliage as well, to give the appearance of a wreath filled with plants.\n\nA seventh is a cascade style. A cascade style of flowers is when flowers are arranged in a tiered style, with long stems trailing down the side and back of the container. This style of arrangement can also include smaller flowers trailing down from large flowers, and is often used in indoor arrangements.\n\nAeighth is a tuber arrangement.

The quotient of 13 and 4 is 1/3. 5 is less than 6. The product of 11 and 5 is 55.\n\nIn this question, explain why each of the statements is true (or false). Be sure to state the rule and how you justify the statement.\n\nAnswer: 1. The quotient is the number you get when you divided two numbers. The value in a fraction is the bottom term of the fraction.\n\n2. Statements 1 and 3 are true because you can always compare a larger number to a smaller number or a smaller number to a larger number.\n\n3. Statements 4 and 2 are true because multiplication is a repeated addition process.\n\n4. Statements 4, 1, 3, and 5 are true because the dividend is the number that is divided, or the numerator, and the divisor is the number that the number is divided by, or the denominator. (2 divided by 3 is 3/2. It is possible to have a quotient larger than 1, but 2 divided by 3 equals 1, and 0 divided by 3 equals.333.)\n\n5.

This means Janet has 26 more cards than Brenda, and Mara has 18 more cards than Janet. Janet has 44 more cards than Brenda and Mara, and together they have 142 cards. But remember, Janet has 2 more cards than Mara. Therefore the cards together are 144. Each person has 44 more than the person before them. Therefore, Brenda has 13. Next, Mara has 39 more cards than Brenta. So she would be 41 more. That means Brenda has 52 and that means Mara has 84 cards, and together they have a total of 136 cards.

Let's say in the example the greater index of [AAAABCCDDDDEEEEEFF] is F.  With an array of 23 elements, the first index is 0, the second is 1, the third is 2, and so on; the last index is 16.  Thus, 16 is the greatest index of the array, because 16 + 1 is 17, which exceeds 23.  Therefore, the greatest index of the example is F, because [FFF] is the last letter.  The second greatest index of the example (after F) is A, because [FFFF] is the fifth letter, which does not exceed 23.\n\nA possible way to arrange the example is\n\n[AAAAC]CEE[CDDCDEEEEEF]\n\nin which [EEEEEEF] becomes the last element.  The first two elements are ordered so that the first index is largest among all elements.

Amy buys milk each day at the groceree where a half gallon has a price of $1.75, while a whole gallon costs at $3.50 a glass. Amy has $78 in cash. How many half gallon glasses of milk can Amy buy on a daily basis? Because half gallon of milk is equal to two pints, Amy can buy $2.95 in half gallon glasses in every day. On a daily basis, Amy can buy $5.90 in pints of milk. Her daily earnings can be determined by multiplying each pints by six. At first, we know that half gallon is equal to two pins. $1.75 for half a gallon means $1.75 per pint. $1.72 multiplied by two equals to $3.44, which means she can buy $3.4", "answer": "A: zoo"}

How many quarts does she need to make soup for this week?\n\n### Answer3: 85\n\n### Explanation:\n\nWhen using the ratio to find out how many quarts you want, you also have to know how much you have.\n\nFor example, if you are making 30 boxes of cookies and you have 20 pounds of ingredients, you'll be able to do 30 boxes.\n\nThe 75 is going to be your quotient and the 35 is your base.\n\nExample of 4:3\nIf you had 12 hours of work and you were done in 4 hours (quotient), then you worked 3 extra hours (base), you had 3 extra hours that didn't count toward your work.\n\nExample: 24:16\n\n24 tells you how many seconds you have, while 16 tells you how many seconds that's taken away/ how many seconds are left.", "answer": "E: card catalogue"}

You get your first car as soon as you turn 16, with some help from your parents. As a teen, a car comes with a learning curve, a lot of responsibility, and a lot of risk. The most prevalent risks for younger motorists are those who are going to be the most significant. According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data from 2010, teenage drivers ages 15 to 18 have a greater risk of car accidents than older motorists, accounting for 202 fatalities every year. In fact, 15-year-olds have the most fatal car accidents per mile driven, while 18-year-olds have 44% of their deaths in an accident, implying that accidents become less frequent as they get older. The fatal crash rate per mile driven is also higher for teenage drivers than other motorists. What is the total amount of money needed to build a house? There are many ways to approach building a house, but one of the most obvious starting points of each structure is the foundation. That is why, according to the Housing Education Foundation, it is very important to understand the total amount of money required for all parts of construction, such as the foundation, and to make sure the house is well built. And just as essential is to know how much it costs to build a house so you can make a budget and stick to it. It will be easier to stay on track if you are aware of the total costs of building a house so you can create a realistic budget. That is why it is the foundation of the house. Your building's foundation is the most important structure, and therefore the most expensive. According to the Home Innovations Research Laboratory, most builders estimate it costs 50% of the total price or more. But because this is the most complex part of the foundation, the cost to build a home varies greatly from state to state and city to city. How long does it take to walk around the earth?

Explain how you know.\n\n### Sales in 2012 are 6 times greater than sales in 1999. 1999 can be found on the y-axis at 2, while 2012 can be found on the x-axis at 5. \n\n## 2: Using the graph as a guide, list one more question that should be answered by the task.\n\n### How large was the price increase for the product from 1999 to 2012? Explain how you found your answer.\n\n### \n\n## 3: What other information would you need, based on this graph? Why? Would it be necessary to contact the company to obtain this information?\n\n### The bar graph does not indicate the number of sales or the price. We can assume from the bar graph, however, that the sales price does increase by 6x during this time period.\n\n## 4: Explain why you chose the answer you chose for the question.\n\n## 5: Write up to three \"How do you know?...because...\" type statements.\n1. (5)How do you know you should take the total price in dollars into consideration?\nBecause the price is increasing 6 times from 1996 to 2010, it may come as a surprise that that there are fewer units in 2010 than in 1996.\n\n2. (5)Do you think it is reasonable to assume that the sales in 2015 will have fewer units sold, but a higher price? Explain.\nYes, because if the company's price increased 6 times between 1996 and 2010 (both units and dollars), it would make sense for their price to increase at least 6 times again from 2010 to 2015.\n\n3.

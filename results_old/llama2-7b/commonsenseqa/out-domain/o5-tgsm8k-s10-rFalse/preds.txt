Choices:  A: drinking B: intimacy C: dancing D: happiness E: enjoyment<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>You can tell by the clues in the question that the first part of the question refers to a birthday party. "If they were celebrating" means that a party is not taking place or has not been planned. The celebration could also take place after a party. "The occasion" refers to either the birthday party or the birthday itself.<n><n>- The first instance of "celebrating" takes place as a noun referring to the birthday party. Subsequent instances of the word are the action of "celebration" as a verb.<n>- There could be confusion about the word "celebration." The context makes it clear the noun refers to the party as is the action of "celeb" as a verb. Therefore, the action of "partying" must be the action of "intimacy": having sex (or at least "making out") in the bedroom that they are renting.<n>- There are two birthdays present in this question: one for the "you" person (having sex with a stripper), and one for the renter (renting a house).<n><n>### Input/Response:<n><n>In this problem, we have two different perspectives: the renter, and his girlfriend.<n><n>- The renter's girlfriend is concerned that the landlord will be worried about their rent.<n>- The landlord is not worried about the rent and is in fact curious as to what the rent might be because this is a first-time renter who has just started a job.<n><n>The best way to respond is to assume that the landlord knows that his rent is late, and that the rent is a mystery. Explain the situation in the easiest possible way. If possible, be sure to point out similarities between your situation and the landlord's circumstances (such as that they've both just started a job).<n><n>### Instructions/Response:<n><n>This is a common idiom in English about money and saving which is often over-used.<n><n>| Instruction            | Response                                                                               |<n>|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|<n>| You will have to pay more in taxes if you drive your car to school. | I am going to have to buy a new car this weekend|<n>| I had to tell him that his

Choices:  A: wooded area B: body of water C: the ocean D: british columbia E: zoo<n><n>### Response:		<n>We cannot know what is right or wrong with the way you think. You need to find ways to discover what works for you.<n><n>### 2) This section is one of the hardest in the whole book, and it's the same for everyone.<n><n>How can I learn to think faster?<n><n>Learning to think faster is all about building a neural system in your brain that's optimized for information.<n><n>We've identified six ways you can optimize this system. If you want to learn information faster, you need to give extra attention to the two most critical.<n><n>1. Learn how to read effectively<n><n>Faster processing occurs when you practice reading effectively. 8th grade reading level or above is required to understand over 60% of the material taught at any university. If you do not know how to read effectively, you'll have a very tough time with college-level work.<n><n>2. Use your eyes to learn<n><n>Visual learners read books and take notes in a book. Auditory learners listen to classes in class. Kinaesthetic learners act out things.<n><n>Tip: Try reading the class and taking notes. That's how I learn to be a better student.<n><n>3. Set aside 30 minutes each day to study<n><n>Setting aside 30 minutes a day helps me study for tests. I find that you can improve your ability to learn information by about 40% in one week if you start early.<n><n>Tip A: For me, I find it's helpful to find a good library and set up the room like I want. I'll bring in a few good books and try to understand them as best as I can.<n><n>4. Write down what you think is important and write on it again later<n><n>I find it super helpful to write down your notes in pen as you're reviewing them again. I've had the most success with pen, as it gives me a better opportunity to actually read my notes as I'm reviewing them.<n><n>5. Get enough sleep<n><n>Getting a good night's sleep is essential to learning.<n><n>Tip B: Make sure you've had at least seven hours of sleep each night. This will help you learn more information. I've found that I often learn more information when I've had more than seven hours of sleep

A few years ago, while doing some work in the kitchen, he slipped and broke his leg. He called an ambulance, got himself to the hospital, and was put under the care of a talented surgeon named Dr. Klaudia and left to rest. The surgery went well. James woke up three days later in the hospital. He could feel some discomfort in his right foot because the surgeon had to insert a metal rod into his shin. The rod would help the leg to heal and restore the right leg’s strength. There were two bags under James’s neck that he couldn’t see and that he was told contained fluids. He was asked to not be removed from his bed for two days because the drugs made him sleepy and he needed to rest. When he woke up after his nap, he was alone again. The doctor entered the room wearing full length medical gear and a full surgical mask. When she saw her patient’s eyes, she quickly told him that it was now safe to get up from the bed and walk around. Then she asked him to open his shirt and look in his left armpit to see if his bandage remained clean, and if he could smell the sage burning. She told him that because of the surgery, his sense of smell had faded. He told her that he never had one to lose. The doctor smiled at him for a moment, then gave him a list of instructions to follow. He asked why he had to do so before she told him that his insurance company was paying for the cost of his surgery, and since he was required to stay under the care of a doctor for seven days afterward, the doctor was willing to reduce the amount by 75 percent. If he were to sign a form, he could then pay the remaining amount and go freely. If he refused, she would do all she could to

Choices:  A: the reward money B: hurt feelings C: being found out D: problems E: trouble<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>* If the question asks us to do something (like what Sean did), we should use should on the question and should on the action. In the case of "constantly worried," we could write "should have worried." It is a good idea to use the question word as the subject of the infinitive since it is already a question phrase. It might help to read the sentence aloud to catch if there are any words missing.<n><n>* If we are asked to report the answer, and the answer can be expressed with a relative clause (a noun group containing a relative pronoun and verb), we need to use that to introduce the relative clause.<n><n>* In general, a that clause can replace a noun phrase or a noun group (like what Sean was lying about).<n><n>* When we have two shoulds (like in "should have done something," or multiple uses of a relative proun, we can remove the relative pronoun. We can rewrite them as that sentences.<n><n>* A relative pronoun can only be used when the infinitive clause has a subject-verb structure (e.g., "He was worried about being found out.").<n><n><n>

The gym charges him $35 per month.  He can only use the gym on weekdays because he needs to go to school during the weekends.  How many dollars does he spend on the gym each month?<n><n><n>### Response <n><n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>Create a program that will simulate the purchase of items.<n><n>### Example 1:<n>First you will calculate the price of an item.  You will start with $0 and increment it by a certain multiple based on the item type. For example, 1 liter of soda costs $1.25, so the price of soda is 10 times its unit price.<n><n>Next you will determine how much of each item is purchased. That depends on available points.  You start out with 0 points, and can use more if you complete certain activities (exercises). The amount of each item is determined by available points.  Note that for some items there is a minimum number of items.  For example, if only at most 3 soda cans are purchased, then the minimum quantity is 1 for soda.<n><n>The first activity to be completed is to type in the type and quantity of each item.  Then start the simulation.  Starting from the very first line, print all the item information and quantity information. For example, if you had purchased 7 cans of soda and 2 cans of coffee, then the output would be soda:7, coffee:2.  You only print one line for each item, so you may have empty lines in between as appropriate.  Then calculate and print each items price as well as the final cost.  Finally, add another activity to print the last exercise points.<n><n>

Then I would subtract 3 for the three days she did not sell any pies. Then the last one was sold at the end of the month and she had only three days without power to bake. So adding those three days together would equal 3. So she had 8 minus 3 equals 5. She had only 5 pies she did not sell on the remaining days of the month. So she baked 39 pies<n><n><n>### Instructions<n>Choose an animal. Then fill in the blank with the right answer:<n>A ____________ may be found in the Arctic region of the world.

For dinner, you want to spend less than $20. You can spend up to $32 on the movie theater ticket. You can also buy a gift card for $15, but you want to have at least $90 left on your gift card. How much can you spend on the movie theater and how much can you spend on dinner<n><n>### Response for input <n><n>Response:  As there are different variables I thought it would be wise not to spend $20 or above on dinner. With this constraint I feel that I cannot afford to spend more than $10 on dinner.  This means that I would have $40 left to spend on a movie ticket and on a gift card.  This is because, I can use the $15 on a gift card and the $25 on $15 gift card to make it $40.  Additionally, I have $30 left to spend on movies.<n><n>### Response : The two variables need to be set up first before making the calculation for the result.<n><n>Input $1,000 in 2 years will gain interest of $257.98.

Choices:  A: jerusalem B: jewish community C: middle east D: city E: mosque<n><n>### Response:		B<n>- I need to take this opportunity to mention the holy mosque in Mecca, which is the holiest site in Islam. This is the temple which every Muslim is obliged to visit. The number of people who visited this temple exceeds a million. Many Muslims visit the temple at least once in their life. The temple is located in the city known as Mecca. Therefore your answer is B.<n><n>- I need to go back to my previous answer. At the end of last season, 300 goals were scored in total. Therefore the number of goals scored by two players accounts for 20 percent of the total number of the goals. The total number of goals scored was equal to 300. Therefore the number of the goals scored by each player is 150.<n><n>- The number of ounces that Tom drinks a day is 12 per can of soda and 64 for water. Therefore, the total number of fluid ounces in the days of a week is 192 divided by 7. Then the number of fluid ounzes in the week is 27.143.<n>- 868 divided by 400 in the end.

With a 23% discount, the new total would be 77% * 116 = 90 67% of 90 = 86.40. 77% is a multiple of 100 which results in a multiple of 23. Which is why the total, given in the responses, is a multiple of 22.<n><n>Question:<n>John would like to buy a sheet of wood that costs $27.49.  He also has a coupon with a 10% off. What is the total with the discount?<n><n>Comment 1:<n>The total cost would be  $15.09<n><n><n>I did this by taking 10% off the original price. So the new original price would be  the original price of the sheet of wood * 0.9 = $ 25.05<n>The new original price has to be less than the new total.<n>So 90% * $25.05 = 225.55. <n>$225.56 is less than 27.50. The total cost for the piece of wood can not be more than 23.83. In this case, for the piece of wood, $23.83 is more than 27.30. This proves the $27.40 is an incorrect cost.<n><n>Comment 2:<n>The total cost is  $48.49<n><n><n>I used the following calculation.<n>The original cost of 27.

Choices:  A: driving B: road C: getting tired D: accidents E: ticket<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>C<n><n>### ANSWER EXPLANATION<n>First, you need to determine your response before performing the actual task.<n>Both Adam and John's purchases weighs 5, since their purchases are equal. So, the cost of their grocery shopping is 5(12+8)-5=23. We can't make a mistake for the answer by looking at the number, 23 only need to check for the answer.<n>The weight of all the equipment weights about 20%, 84 times of 450, 408 kg. We can use a similar idea like the first input. We just need to check the answer by counting.<n>The amount of fuel in both tanks' capacity is now equal, and the amount of fuel they need to buy is now four times of the amount of fuel when the capacity was not doubled, so the amount of fuel that they will buy is now 20% of 400 times two. 800 times two, 1600 kg.<n>We can assume that in each shift there is a player, since the players scored the same number of goals as the number of goals scored in Barca. Let the goal scorer in shift t be $x$th, there is 12 players in a year, since no players can have the same number of goals in the same year and we can not use 13, we can use 12. Let $a_t$th and the amount of goal scored by a player of the tth player that we need to calculate, $b_t$th is the number of goals scored by the other player. Since the number of players does not increase, we can apply to the same trick like the first two. There are $b+a$ players in a year, so the first 12 players will share $2a$ goals to the 13th and 13th players, then the number of goals we need to calculate is $b_t+b_{2t+1}=b_t+a_t$. <n>Assume that every day of Tom drinks 12 fluid ounces, each of 12, so a week, he has 84 ounces of soda and 96 ounces of water, so he has 96+84

Choices:  A: happiness B: relaxation C: create music D: sadness E: loud noises<n><n>### Response:		You can still play different types of piano in different tune, if you are not good in playing violin.<n><n>### Response(Optional):If you are good at playing piano then you can play and sing on the same time!!!!<n><n>### Input You are given a word and the number of characters in that word.<n>The task is to count the number of distinct characters in that word. You must also calculate the percentage of lowercase and uppercase characters. For example, given word “computer”, the number of character in that word is 9. The number of distinct characters in this word is 5 (uppercase c in computer). For counting lowercase and  upper case, the counting of each character should be done.<n><n>### Input An example word “computer” has 2 “R” character so number of unique character in that word is “2”.<n>### Input There is a sentence in a file which has space( ) separating each word into 2 letter words. It has 46 unique character (10 lower and 36 upper).<n>There is total 46 character in that file and that character is unique, means there will be no repetition of any single character in the file. The code works but it is not optimized, because it check for unique again and again, which is not optimized.<n>### Solution- Above solution is not optimized, so instead of checking for unique character again and again, we can use hash map.<n> <n>This method creates an object of map, which contains all the unique character as value ( key) and the count of that character as the value (value). <n>When we try to calculate how many lower case is there and how many upper case are there, the idea behind calculating and optimizing is we iterate through the loop by using for loop and we check count of that character every time against the already existing count and add 1 if its count is already 1 or add that character in the dict if its not (already existing), after that use the dict to count the number of lower and upper case. <n>### Input We can make this method dynamic and can add or remove any characters from the dict, such that any new characters can be added in the dict.<n><n>### Code for below problem<n><n>### Input We should always print the value when incrementing because while printing the value we need to check the unique character but while incrementing

How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?<n>Answer: 4<n><n>Input: James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.  How much does he pay now for fuel?<n>Answer: 480<n><n>Input: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.<n>Answer: 30<n><n>Input: Every day Tom drinks 5 12-oz cans of soda plus 64 ounces of water. How many ounces of fluid does he drink a week?<n>Answer: 868<n><n>### Input:James wanted to stop competing.  What might he have been feeling? Choices:  A: pressure B: death C: trying harder D: quitting E: winning or losing<n><n>### Response:		<n>> In my opinion, A and B are the choices which are a little extreme. However, C and D are the answers. I think A is the choice because James might feel the pressure or dead. Besides, C and D choices are the best choices since he wanted to stop competing and James might feel that try harder or winning or losing sometimes be overwhelming and make the situation harder to control.<n><n>### Input<n><n>> The average number of goals scored by the top 10 teams last season was 185. 73% of these scores were scored by seven of the top teams. These seven teams also scored 5804 goals combined. These teams were Arsenal, Man City, Barcelona, Man United, Real Madrid, Juventus and Zengzhou. If Zengzhou's score was also 185, how many goals did each team score?<n><n>> How many other teams also received an invitation to compete in this tournament? Choices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9<n><n>### Response<n><n>> According to my understanding, it is 9. This is because 73% of the goals was scored by 7 teams, and the top 10 players need to find another 1. To be more specific, if Zengzhou' s score is 185, the number of goals that each team score must include the score of Zengzhou. Then the number of goals is the sum of the goals by the nine teams. Therefore, my answer is 9.<n><n>### Output<n><n>> 897 or 5805 goals<n>

The celebration could also take place after a party. \"The occasion\" refers to either the birthday party or the birthday itself.\n\n- The first instance of \"celebrating\" takes place as a noun referring to the birthday party. Subsequent instances of the word are the action of \"celebration\" as a verb.\n- There could be confusion about the word \"celebration.\" The context makes it clear the noun refers to the party as is the action of \"celeb\" as a verb. Therefore, the action of \"partying\" must be the action of \"intimacy\": having sex (or at least \"making out\") in the bedroom that they are renting.\n- There are two birthdays present in this question: one for the \"you\" person (having sex with a stripper), and one for the renter (renting a house).\n\n### Input/Response:\n\nIn this problem, we have two different perspectives: the renter, and his girlfriend.\n\n- The renter's girlfriend is concerned that the landlord will be worried about their rent.\n- The landlord is not worried about the rent and is in fact curious as to what the rent might be because this is a first-time renter who has just started a job.\n\nThe best way to respond is to assume that the landlord knows that his rent is late, and that the rent is a mystery.

{"text": "We cannot know what is right or wrong with the way you think. You need to find ways to discover what works for you.\n\n### 2) This section is one of the hardest in the whole book, and it's the same for everyone.\n\nHow can I learn to think faster?\n\nLearning to think faster is all about building a neural system in your brain that's optimized for information.\n\nWe've identified six ways you can optimize this system. If you want to learn information faster, you need to give extra attention to the two most critical.\n\n1. Learn how to read effectively\n\nFaster processing occurs when you practice reading effectively. 8th grade reading level or above is required to understand over 60% of the material taught at any university. If you do not know how to read effectively, you'll have a very tough time with college-level work.\n\n2. Use your eyes to learn\n\nVisual learners read books and take notes in a book. Auditory learners listen to classes in class. Kinaesthetic learners act out things.\n\nTip: Try reading the class and taking notes. That's how I learn to be a better student.\n\n3. Set aside 30 minutes each day to study\n\nSetting aside 30 minutes a day helps me study for tests. I find that you can improve your ability to learn information by about 40% in one week if you start early.\n\nTip A: For me, I find it's helpful to find a good library and set up the room like I want. I'll bring in a few good books and try to understand them as best as I can.\n\n4. Write down what you think is important and write on it again later\n\nI find it super helpful to write down your notes in pen as you're reviewing them again. I've had the most success with pen, as it gives me a better opportunity to actually read my notes as I'm reviewing them.\n\n5. Get enough sleep\n\nGetting a good night's sleep is essential to learning.\n\nTip B: Make sure you've had at least seven hours of sleep each night. This will help you learn more information. I've found that I often learn more information when I've had more than seven hours of sleep", "answer": "B: body of water"}

A few years ago, while doing some work in the kitchen, he slipped and broke his leg. He called an ambulance, got himself to the hospital, and was put under the care of a talented surgeon named Dr. Klaudia and left to rest. The surgery went well. James woke up three days later in the hospital. He could feel some discomfort in his right foot because the surgeon had to insert a metal rod into his shin. The rod would help the leg to heal and restore the right leg\u2019s strength. There were two bags under James\u2019s neck that he couldn\u2019t see and that he was told contained fluids. He was asked to not be removed from his bed for two days because the drugs made him sleepy and he needed to rest. When he woke up after his nap, he was alone again. The doctor entered the room wearing full length medical gear and a full surgical mask. When she saw her patient\u2019s eyes, she quickly told him that it was now safe to get up from the bed and walk around. Then she asked him to open his shirt and look in his left armpit to see if his bandage remained clean, and if he could smell the sage burning. She told him that because of the surgery, his sense of smell had faded. He told her that he never had one to lose. The doctor smiled at him for a moment, then gave him a list of instructions to follow. He asked why he had to do so before she told him that his insurance company was paying for the cost of his surgery, and since he was required to stay under the care of a doctor for seven days afterward, the doctor was willing to reduce the amount by 75 percent.

How many dollars does he spend on the gym each month?\n\n\n### Response \n\n\n### Instructions:\n\nCreate a program that will simulate the purchase of items.\n\n### Example 1:\nFirst you will calculate the price of an item.  You will start with $0 and increment it by a certain multiple based on the item type. For example, 1 liter of soda costs $1.25, so the price of soda is 10 times its unit price.\n\nNext you will determine how much of each item is purchased. That depends on available points.  You start out with 0 points, and can use more if you complete certain activities (exercises). The amount of each item is determined by available points.  Note that for some items there is a minimum number of items.  For example, if only at most 3 soda cans are purchased, then the minimum quantity is 1 for soda.\n\nThe first activity to be completed is to type in the type and quantity of each item.  Then start the simulation.  Starting from the very first line, print all the item information and quantity information. For example, if you had purchased 7 cans of soda and 2 cans of coffee, then the output would be soda:7, coffee:2.  You only print one line for each item, so you may have empty lines in between as appropriate.  Then calculate and print each items price as well as the final cost.

How much can you spend on the movie theater and how much can you spend on dinner\n\n### Response for input \n\nResponse:  As there are different variables I thought it would be wise not to spend $20 or above on dinner. With this constraint I feel that I cannot afford to spend more than $10 on dinner.  This means that I would have $40 left to spend on a movie ticket and on a gift card.

He also has a 23% off coupon. What is the total cost of the piece of wood, based on the coupon?|\n| Answer| $86.40|\n\n### Response\n\nA.\n\n### Justification\nSentence:\nThe answer in the response is always a multiple. 23% off means that the cost of the item is now 77% of the original price. With a 23% discount, the new total would be 77% * 116 = 90 67% of 90 = 86.40. 77% is a multiple of 100 which results in a multiple of 23. Which is why the total, given in the responses, is a multiple of 22.\n\nQuestion:\nJohn would like to buy a sheet of wood that costs $27.49.  He also has a coupon with a 10% off. What is the total with the discount?\n\nComment 1:\nThe total cost would be  $15.09\n\n\nI did this by taking 10% off the original price. So the new original price would be  the original price of the sheet of wood * 0.9 = $ 25.05\nThe new original price has to be less than the new total.\nSo 90% * $25.05 = 225.55. \n$225.56 is less than 27.50. The total cost for the piece of wood can not be more than 23.83. In this case, for the piece of wood, $23.83 is more than 27.30. This proves the $27.40 is an incorrect cost.\n\nComment 2:\nThe total cost is  $48.49\n\n\nI used the following calculation.\nThe original cost of 27.", "answer": "B: polished"}

If the car starts with the engine at 1000 RPM (rotations per minute) and is speeding up at the rate of 300 RPM per second, when will does the car reach 70 MPH?\n\n### Response\nWhen does the car reaches 70 MPH is 20 seconds because 300 is 20% of 1500 and the driver has two gears to choose from and the car is shifted and the rpm increases by 20%.\n\n### Input A farmer has a chicken that only lays eggs on the days when the number of the day is divisible by 3. The farmer counts the number of times he has to collect eggs on a certain Monday and Tuesday; how many eggs did he have to collect on those two days?\n\n### Answer 2\n\nFirst, divide 0 by 3 and you get 0. The next day, Tuesday, it is 1 (since 1 divided by 3 is also equal to 0), the farmer will have to collect 33 eggs that day.\n\nThe next day, Wednesday, the farmer counts the number times he collected eggs and divide the count by 3; the farmer got 0 again, this means 0 divided by 3 is equal to 0 again.\nTherefore, on Wednesday, the number of eggs he had to collect is equal to 0. \n\nThe next day is again Thursday and the farmer counts the eggs again and divides it by 3, the count is again 0. \nThe number of eggs that are left uncollected (the ones that are being laid) is 21.\n\nThe next is Friday and the count is again 1. The number of eggs on Friday collected is 2. \n\nThe last two days that the farmer went to collect the eggs are the same day.\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs on Monday and T", "answer": "B: center"}

(Round your answer to the nearest tenth.)\n##### Solution: Water is made up of both solid and liquid\nSolids: 5%\nLiquids: 95%\nAdd 5%+95% = 9999/10000, so the total water is 9999 tenths/1000\nRounding down, 9599 tenths\n##### Explanations: \nThe percentage of water on earth is 97.5%. This indicates that, if water was all there is on earth then 0.5% (97.5%-97%) is the amount of water would be solid. There's also liquid water. Water = liquid + solid, so 97.5% is water. 0.5*97.5 = 172.025 and this", "answer": "B: feel more comfortable"}
{"text": "C\n\n### ANSWER EXPLANATION\nFirst, you need to determine your response before performing the actual task.\nBoth Adam and John's purchases weighs 5, since their purchases are equal. So, the cost of their grocery shopping is 5(12+8)-5=23. We can't make a mistake for the answer by looking at the number, 23 only need to check for the answer.\nThe weight of all the equipment weights about 20%, 84 times of 450, 408 kg. We can use a similar idea like the first input. We just need to check the answer by counting.\nThe amount of fuel in both tanks' capacity is now equal, and the amount of fuel they need to buy is now four times of the amount of fuel when the capacity was not doubled, so the amount of fuel that they will buy is now 20% of 400 times two. 800 times two, 1600 kg.\nWe can assume that in each shift there is a player, since the players scored the same number of goals as the number of goals scored in Barca. Let the goal scorer in shift t be $x$th, there is 12 players in a year, since no players can have the same number of goals in the same year and we can not use 13, we can use 12. Let $a_t$th and the amount of goal scored by a player of the tth player that we need to calculate, $b_t$th is the number of goals scored by the other player. Since the number of players does not increase, we can apply to the same trick like the first two. There are $b+a$ players in a year, so the first 12 players will share $2a$ goals to the 13th and 13th players, then the number of goals we need to calculate is $b_t+b_{2t+1}=b_t+a_t$. \nAssume that every day of Tom drinks 12 fluid ounces, each of 12, so a week, he has 84 ounces of soda and 96 ounces of water, so he has 96+84", "answer": "A: driving"}

The line that takes in the argument is labeled \"input\" in this example.\n\nInput: The user enters the age and height.\n\nThe line that does the input is called \"input\". In this way, if one were to take the number for the age or height, the result would be the same.\n\nThen, there are multiple calculations that you may want to make using a specific number. The following example will create a \"subroutine\". You may also want to add in your calculation as a \"subroutine\" as well.\n\nIn order to do this, use the following example.\n\nCalculation: Take the input and subtract 20.\n\nIn this example, you subtract 20 from any number that your user enter.

You must also calculate the percentage of lowercase and uppercase characters. For example, given word \u201ccomputer\u201d, the number of character in that word is 9. The number of distinct characters in this word is 5 (uppercase c in computer). For counting lowercase and  upper case, the counting of each character should be done.\n\n### Input An example word \u201ccomputer\u201d has 2 \u201cR\u201d character so number of unique character in that word is \u201c2\u201d.\n### Input There is a sentence in a file which has space( ) separating each word into 2 letter words. It has 46 unique character (10 lower and 36 upper).\nThere is total 46 character in that file and that character is unique, means there will be no repetition of any single character in the file. The code works but it is not optimized, because it check for unique again and again, which is not optimized.\n### Solution- Above solution is not optimized, so instead of checking for unique character again and again, we can use hash map.\n \nThis method creates an object of map, which contains all the unique character as value ( key) and the count of that character as the value (value). \nWhen we try to calculate how many lower case is there and how many upper case are there, the idea behind calculating and optimizing is we iterate through the loop by using for loop and we check count of that character every time against the already existing count and add 1 if its count is already 1 or add that character in the dict if its not (already existing), after that use the dict to count the number of lower and upper case. \n### Input We can make this method dynamic and can add or remove any characters from the dict, such that any new characters can be added in the dict.\n\n### Code for below problem\n\n### Input We should always print the value when incrementing because while printing the value we need to check the unique character but while incrementing", "answer": "D: sadness"}

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Rationales: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>#### 44<n>Answer: 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Rationales: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>#### 6<n>Answer: 6<n><n>### Input:Google Maps and other highway and street GPS services have replaced what?

The doctor told him: "If you don't want to have a cast on both of your legs, just ask nicely."<n>"OK," said Jack, "I've changed my mind, please don't cast my left leg."<n>"That's fair," said the doctor, "I think I can manage without that.  Now, if you don't care what happens to your other leg...?"<n><n>### Answer<n><n>"Yes?" responded Jack, confused.<n><n>### Answer 2:<n>* Jack: Doctor, if I make a request for my right leg, and I make a request for something that I want, then I don’t want it for my other leg.<n>* Response: You have a left leg, do you not?<n>* Jack: Yes, but I don’t really care for it.<n><n>### Response<n>He went with the second explanation.<n>* Jack: Oh okay, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean I DON’T CARE for it, yes I do care for it a little bit so I hope I won’t get a cast on it.<n><n>##   The first explanation seemed to be the most convincing.  In the example, it seemed as though Jack asked a question, “Do you doctor not wanna cast [it on] my good leg?”  This was definitely a mistake and would have been corrected to, “Do you think it is better to cast [it on] both of my legs?”<n><n>## Explanation 1<n>Honestly.<n>The only thing the doctor heard in this scenario was, "If I don't want a cast on both my legs.."  He didn't even hear the entire sentence.  All he heard for the first half of this was the word, "want".  In a moment he didn't want a cast to be on both legs but he didn't know to ask if the other leg could be spared!<n><n>## The first explanation that he gave seemed to be the most logical.  He was almost correct about using the second explanation.  With the second explanation, he would say, "So if I could ask for my right leg to be okay, could the other leg be okay?  I don't

He went to market and as soon as he returned he closed his shop. Then he used to spend the rest of the day sitting under the shade of a large fig tree in his garden. His home was surrounded by a high wall.<n>One day when he was at home alone sitting under the tree watching a flock of pigeons he overheard two robbers talking about how they were going to rob his shop that very night and then escape. When it got dark they would come and open the shutters to let in the light and he would be sleeping. Then they would take everything.<n>He was shocked to hear how his life was in danger. “He is rich and he is sitting under the tree all alone he will be an easy target,” said one of the robbers.<n>The man got up and went to his wife and told her everything. He told her that he was not going to close his shop that day and would not allow the robbers to come and kill him.<n>Apart from everything else he was also worried for his wife. What would she do in the time he was gone? His wife knew the risk he was taking and she was afraid.<n>“What can I do?” she asked herself. But then she remembered how she had learnt how to make pigeons. She knew that the pigeons would tell her when they were being held captive as they would make a racket. She thought to herself “I have two children, their lives are more important than my husband’s life.” She made a coop for a chicken and filled it with grains and placed it near the fig tree. Then she let her children out.<n>The very next day, the pigeons started to make a noise as if they were suffering. Then they flew out and the children started to follow. They were shouting the whole way “It is only a couple of blocks away.  It is only a couple of a blocks away.” As they walked more and more pigeons were coming.

I am not aware of religious service for a confession but I can think that a synagogue and an office could be a place where the speech is held, however a synagogue would probably be a place where people listen to the reading of the Torah and that could be read by a man or woman, therefore it would not be a place where many people would listen to speeches. An office could be considered a place where people listen a religious speech where they are talking about work as office is a place that everyone has daily life. Lastly a church is a place where many people can listen to religious speech in many parts in the church.

His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Rationales: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>#### 6<n>Answer: 6<n><n>### Input:Sky diving scared him, once they jumped out of the plane he began losing consciousness while what?

In the comic book he is going to name a character after his mom, if he names the comic character "Lisa," what will the character in the comic book have for a power/ability?<n><n>### Response 2:<n>The comic character will have the super power/ability to be a great listener.<n><n>### How do you know 1 and 2 are correct?<n><n>1: Since the question didn't say "Once they jumped out of plane" it would indicate that he would be jumping out of the plane and then beginning to lose consciousness, it is not stated whether he lost consciousness after he jumped out so it means he was injured before he jumped out of the 2: Choices are A,C,D,E: A says He began falling down. and not that he started to lose consciousness. A also says "he began losing consciousness" Choices A and E must be eliminated. C says "he began losing his consciousness while playing uno" However, The question states that it will begin after he jumps out of the plane. Choice D can't be eliminated because it states that it will do what will "prevent his from falling down." A and E can be eliminated because they have an "s" attached. That could only mean that he won't have consciousness. C can be eliminated because it says "while he was playing uno he began to lose consciousness" this means the question is written from the perspective of him. The question doesn't state we would be looking at the event from his perspective. So Choice D and C must be eliminated. Therefore, choice B must be the only remaining option. 2: Since the question states that his name will be named after his mom, choice B is the only correct option. Choice A says "to be named after dad." B states that he name will be named after "Lisa." If Lisa were a male name, it would be plural. The comic character would be named after Lisa's. Choices A,C are incorrect because it says he is going to name the comic character "lisa" and only male names are in the choices. Choice D say he is going to name

Bella’s dog is a Maltese. Gertrude wants to know which breed Bella’s dog most resembles; therefore, she asks Bella: If the Poodle is the crossbreed of a Spaniel, then which of the following statements is true?  Answer:  I: The Poodle and Maltese are related, because Poodle and Spaniel are both breeds of dogs. II: The Poodle is related to the Maltese, because Maltese is a crossbreed of the Poodle and a Spaniel III: The crossbreed is related to the Mixed Dog, because Mixed Dog is a crossbreed  of Poodle and Spanier  Questions I and II are true, but III is false.  Therefore, Gertrude asks Bella, the Maltese most likely resembles the Poodle, because if the Poodle were a crossbreed of a dog and another dog, then the Poodle most closely resembles the dog that the Poodle was crossbred with.  This is because one crossbred puppy is more like his mother, than his father.  Now, Bella thinks that Gertrude is not familiar with the details, because no one ever mixes up which puppy is which, if a breeder has a litter.<n>### Answer:B<n>### Input: 30 seconds later, Bella notified Gertrude that her dog was  a Mixed Dog.  Bella was wrong.  She asked Gertrude which breed of dog the Mixed Dog most resembles.  Answer:  I.  Maltese II. Spaniel III. Poodle  The Poodle resembles the Spaniel, because Spaniel is Maltese’s breeder. Therefore, the Poodle and the Mixed Dog are similar, because the Mixed Dog is the crossbreed offspring of the Poodle.  That’s why her Poodle and Mixed Dog are both related to Spaniel.<n>### Answer : A<n>### Input:Mrs. Jonson would never make this type of error, because Mrs. Jons

His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.

She's going to take two Advil and have something to drink before she goes. S: Anita has a headache all day but is going to the gym anyway. She will take two Advil and something to drink before going. Why is the correct sentence grammatically correct?<n><n>### Demostration: <n>Input:Anita has had a head ache all day. She feels it is going to make us sick, but she'e going to the gym. She's going take two Advil and some thing to drink before she goes<n>Rationales: The phrase  she'e going to take is modifying the object she, so we can say that she and the Advil are subject in the sentence. You can replace  Anita+Advil by she,  so the clause S is subject.  The word gym is a object in the sentence, and the part before the that are the prepositional phrase. The sentence S:Anita has a headache is  a  subject, which is also a noun.  Since we said before "the gym" was object, we can apply the same reasoning to this, and say that the headache is the noun.<n>#### <n>The reason it is grammatically correct is because  if the sentence is S: Anita has had all day headache, she is the subject, so  "She'" must be a noun. The prepositional phrase before "all day" is head ache, and since it is modifying the main clause "all day", all day is the object here. The subject is she and the prepositional phrase is the object. We have to know that "head ache" is modifying she, so the head ache is subject. Anita is then adverb because her head ache is modifying her other pronoun. This sentence is like S: anita has a head ache so she feels really bad,  "she" is the subject and  "head ache" the object in the sentence.  We can apply the same technique to sentences like S:She has 5 apple. We

Choices:  A: winning B: entertainment C: happiness D: cheating E: relaxation<n><n>### Response:		<n>Mary played a game of Monopoly with her brother.  If she wants to be the winner, she will need to collect all the properties first.  After, if she lands on a property, she needs to pay 2 rental fees.  If she lands on any of her properties she'll win a lot of money.  She landed on every one of her properties but unfortunately, she didn't have enough money to buy all of them after the first time she landed on her money property.  She then realized the rest of the money didn't really matter.  She still won because she was the first person to land on all of her properties.  But if you win a game of monopoly by landing on all your properties, its not only a reward for you, its entertainment for everyone playing with you.  Whenever you play a game with other people, its not only for happiness and relaxation, its entertainment.  That's why people like playing games.<n><n>

F is the answer the people need to be able to know. The most logical answer is B.<n>Rationales:A-No one needs equipment there, that's not the "venue" people go when they can't afford it, you have a large selection and you can't find it anywhere else. The people who went here are rich and the store itself is rich. D and E doesn't make sense either, sears is for people who can afford $200-$250 for equipment which is the entry level of what you have to buy equipment wise on average. E is a store for cheap equipment which most people don't have. Even B isn't the correct answer though, as dicks is a brand. It's a more specific answer though.

Choices:  A: problems B: not noticeable C: deflation D: economic instability E: eat cake<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input:<n>What could fighting inflation<n>cause if it is not successful<n><n>If you ask what could fighting inflation cause, it could be that it results in deflation, which is when your money no longer has the same spending power. This can also cause economic instability, not very noticeable in our day to day lives. If you ask what deflation could also cause, that could be that the public doesn't do anything to buy, but rather they wait until they can buy it for less. This may cause the economy to slow down, and when the public starts to buy again, the prices rise, resulting in an inflationary scenario. This is where fighting inflation may have deflationary side effects. If you ask what are some of the other drawbacks of fighting inflation, a possible answer could be that it may create a vicious cycle. If people who do not save money spend money they don't have and if that inflation occurs, the cost of everything will increase, making it even harder to save money, and thus creating a cycle.<n><n>####<n>Answer:<n><n>### Response<n>Input: If I am a seller and the market demand is high, what is my best choice<n><n>Response: If I am a business owner and the market demand is extremely high, my best course of action is to increase my prices just a little bit in order not to lose out on money. This is my best choice because I want to cash in on the moment while the prices are extremely high and the demand is high. This also depends on my business and how high demand is. For instance, if it is for fresh vegetable stand, if the demand is extreme, then I would increase my prices just a bit in order to make more money, without hurting the profit too much. If I had a small business, then I might not do this since I only make small amounts of money, but I would have to increase prices a high amount and might end up losing out on clients.<n><n>### Input::You are considering buying a house.

He isn't going to spend much money on his hotel.  John is staying in a farm.<n><n>Rationales: John isn't picky about his hotel. He picks the cheapest place to stay.  John might be staying on the farm because he is going out in the farm.

It has more facilities and offer more services. If you are going to travel a lot and do not like staying in a farm, hotel is a great choice. If you are on a short trip and go to a different place most of the time, motel is a good choice.<n><n>Motels are located away from town or other urban areas as much as possible, with a distance of at least one mile. A number of motels are built along major highways of the United States and other English-speaking countries.<n><n>Hotels are located in the city center or near it, and the choice of locations is done in order to attract maximum possible number of customers. Hotels are more expensive than motels, and they offer a range of services to the guests, so the choice of hotel is often limited to those who can afford it.<n><n>### Question:John wanted to buy a phone.

He starts at $8 a pop. When he is out of the product, he raises the price by $2 a pop until he gets his desired profit. A customer buys 4 units and tells the salesman that they won't buy at the higher price. He ends up selling a total of 16 units. How much did the salesman sell his remaining stock for?  $20 / $2.50  $24 / $2.33  $28 / $2.24  $32 / $2.16<n><n>### Response/Output: The correct answer is D: $30<n><n>Answer: The product cost the salesman $8 and he sold each for $10.<n>The total number of units sold is 16.<n>Then, we subtract the original stock (4) from the total stock (16) and that gives us 12 which we multiply by $8 to get $96.<n>This means the salesman made $96 profit.<n>Now, we divide the profit by the cost per unit to get the cost of the remaining stock<n>$( 96 / 10 = 9.6) / 8 = 1.2$.<n>In other words, he made $12 profit per sale, thus making $12*16 = $204.<n>(12*16)/2.5 = $30.<n><n>#### 30<n>Answer: 12

Choices:  A: toy store B: home C: school D: toy shop E: shelf<n><n>### Response:		<n>I would play board games in my room, in the living room, or around my kitchen table with my family. This is because there are very few things to do in the toy shop. We don't have anything to eat in the store and there's no way to bring a board game to the store. I can also be pretty sure my family won't have time to play a board game in the shop. My family only goes to the toy shop to buy toys and we usually don't even go in there just for fun. It would also be pretty hard to play a board game while sitting on the toys display table at the shop because the table is full of toys and we can't sit there. The store floor is also too dirty to be playing games in. Another reason I would not play a board game with my family in the toy store is because my mom would never allow us to take food to the store. So if I were to get any snacks, I would have to sneak them in. We don't live near a school so there's no board game I would want to play somewhere in a school. A board game would be pretty boring for my family while we are eating lunch or walking around the school. Playing a board game with my siblings at their school would just be me and my siblings playing when we would otherwise be having fun and being social with our friends. It's also hard to play board games in an empty classroom.<n><n>Another reason I would not play board games with my family in the store is because food and drinks are not allowed inside, so no snacks or other food that might get ruined by a board game on my lap. <n><n>Another reason why I can't play board games with my parents and siblings at my house is because my house is very busy, there are a lot of people there and things that have to get done. The majority of the times the dining room table (which is perfect for a board game) is either in use by my parents, siblings, or someone making a snack or some sort of meal for us to eat. The other option is that there is often no one else in the house (since I live with my grandparents) or so my parents and brothers are out the door for something.<n><n>Another one might be in the school library or cafeteria as

The value does not go negative, so it's always increasing.<n>If the second number is less than the third, in other words, | << -3+5+9>>20 if the first number is negative, it's still negative (even when we add or subtract). The second number becomes larger than the 3rd and when the last number is a large positive number, it is larger than this and eventually ends up being smaller than the first number. So the sign flips, which creates a negative absolute value and the number line starts to decrease.<n><n>Since positive numbers always increase and negative numbers always decreases, positive minus a positive number is always positive. So, a plus two is always, will always be positive. Positive minus positive always positive. If I start with a positive, I add 3, if I have a number, I have a positive number, to the positive number, I'm always going to be more positive. <n>##### 1<n>Answer: Increasing<n><n>Input: 20<n><n>### Input : What does 20 divided by 12 equal<n><n>### Response : What are we dividing by?<n><n>### Answers:<n>1st Response :<n>20<n><n>12<n><n>5<n><n>#### 5<n>Answer: 5<n><n>2nd Response :<n>20 ÷ ||<<>20÷12>>20 Divided by 12: 5 <n><n>3rd Response :<n>20 divided by 2: 10<n><n>4th Response :<n>20 div 9: 2<n><n>5th Response :<n>10 divided by 15: 0.6<n><n>6th Response :<n><n>20<n><n>7th Response :<n>24<n><n>8th Response :<n>23<n><n>9th Response :<n>2 <n><n>10 Response : 1<n><n>#### 10<n>Answer: 1<n>

John, being a spirit, may be seen without being afraid.<n>2. Spirit is an emotion that is sometimes a mixture of love and fear. It is the only<n>emotion that can be felt in both directions. When people see John, they may have a<n>fearful feeling. They may fear him, which is the same as fear being part of it. They<n>may also fear him for fear or the same reason.

Choices:  A: question B: dispute C: deny D: contradict E: refuse<n><n>### Response:		<n>It would have to fail if the reference either denys or contradicts the applicant. A, B, and C will not work, because any of the other choices will not do anything, but these options contradict an applicant. D, however, will lead to a rejection if the reference questions the application. To confirm the reference, the reference would have to agree with the application, which is the only right answer option.<n><n>#### Answer: D<n><n>### Input :What action does the police need to take in order to question a suspect in an arrest made without a warrant? Choices:  a: call a lawyer b: release on a bond c: question without an attorney present d: release any statements from the suspect<n><n>### Response :<n><n>So the answer is in the question. The police needs to question the suspect with an attorney present. If there is no warrant, the police cannot read the suspect their rights since it would be illegal without a court order. The other choices however, do not require the police to be correct and to not allow the rights of an arrestee. An arrestee cannot sign a bond without an attorney present and can only release statements that are false until an attorney is present.<n><n>#### Answer : C<n><n><n>### Instructions:Answers this multiple choice question.<n>Input: Caitlyn has a collection of 36 stickers, 5 t-shirts in a bag.

We can choose one of the choices, but not all. There are options so we can't choose the correct one.<n><n>* We have to check which answer is unchecked.<n><n>* We can answer multiple choice question if we know the information and can choose the correct answer.<n><n>* If we don't know the information, we can use hints to check our answers.<n><n>* Notice that after we check we can go back to check our answers because we didn't know the information.<n><n>### Extension:<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Given that 777 is between 10,008 and 11,052, there is no need to use the hints. It provides us with answers as opposed to clues. 777 is a multiple of 7x108, and thus is divisible by 7. We can deduce that 777 / 7 = 108 and use the clue "45" and see that 108 + 45 = 153. We see that between 100 and 150. We can then determine that 999 (or 1000 - 1) is between 9,000 and 14,500, which implies that it is divisible by 230. 777 + 999 = 1776, which means that 777 + (999 / 108) = 1777 is between the 11,196 and 11,204. A prime number that is greater or equal to 2. We therefore deduce that 11,179 (230 * 50) is divisible by 50. 1777 * 50 = 93850 (11,178 + 7) and so the answer is that it is between 11,000 and the 11,027

To accomodate this growth, the mayor has decided to add 3 new bus lines to transport more residents to work more places. The buses run in the morning to and from downtown. The buses run to the north, west, and south areas during the day. They run late night (or evening) to get residents home from work.  How many people could this bus line system transport each day?  Enter your answer below as a comma-separated (and comma-free!) list.<n><n>Rationales:<n><n>#### 1<n>Answer: 1<n><n>### Answer:<n>Why do we use and for the plurals of one and two and a for plural three to nine or ten?<n><n>In the English language, the words, one, two and three are called "singular". This means that they can be used to refer to one or two or three of something. The words, "four", "five" and "six" (and seven, eight and nine) are called "ordinal". This means that they show position, such as third, fifth and ninth. The words for these numbers were originally plural nouns, such as "these" or "those", or adjectives. In Old English singular nouns could be shown with an "s", but it often disappeared. For instance, "six" could be written as "sixeth" with the "s" disappearing after a while. As time went on, most modern languages changed the "-eth" ending into the letter "s" on its own for the plural, so today the word "six" is singular in most (but not all) modern languages.<n><n>One of the English words that survived the Middle Ages when so many of the original forms dropped away was "one".

But usually it will have shops as well.  In this case, it has 5 stores not just one.  So answer E<n>B:An urban area should have lots of people.  But a military base has many soldiers.  So answer E.<n>C:New York city should have lots of people, like B.  But this question doesn’t say what the people are doing.  It says stores and movies.  So answer E to the new york city.<n>D:A shopping mall is a type of placE where many stores are located on one floor.  But it is not a place where movies are shown.  But if you go to a movie theater, there will be stores you can go into between the movie scenes.  Not in the middle of the movie, but at the beginning and after.  Also, malls have a food court and that is a nice place to eat.

He was frightened.  He didn't want this.  He was scared of what? Choices:  A: death B: coma C: peace D: forgetfulness E: loss of life<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>- A: This makes sense. The answer is "death" because "he didn't want this" means he didn't want to die and he was losing consciousness. When someone loses consciousness they are dying and could enter a coma.<n>- B: The correct answer is "peace". The answer is "he was scared of what" and he was "frightened". This sounds like he was scared and therefore, he is trying to find peace with himself. The answer is peace and is not the loss of life.<n>- C: This is incorrect because there is no way "he was scared" could mean "coma". The author did not say that and there is no reference to a "scared coma" anywhere in the statement. Therefore, the answer is not C.<n>- D: This is incorrect because "forgetfulness" is only concerned with a "loss of life" not "death". If someone were to forget their life, whether or not they're conscious, they wouldn't be "scared of death". Therefore, the answer is definitely NOT B.<n><n>### Input The cat's owner said, "He is a good cat."<n>How could you conclude that the cat was good? Choices A: He was not a bad cat.

Choices:  A: mountains countryside B: ground C: bridge D: mountain range E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		The water comes from the sea or ocean; because the river is in direct contact with sea water, its salinity is also greater. If you throw a stone into the river, 2 cases may occur. The first case is that the stone does not completely submerge in water, then it will move to the shore. In this case, only the movement of solid and water bodies will affect the water level, the water level will rise and fall. The second case is that the stone sinks completely in the river. The force generated by the falling stone will drive a large amount of water to generate waves and currents in the water body. In order for the splash in the river to be big, it is necessary that the stone completely enters the water body, and then there will be many other factors that affect the waves and currents in it: the depth, slope, and temperature of the water; as well as the speed of flow, the shape of the stones and the structure of the river area. Therefore, it is difficult to judge the water level fluctuations only from the geographical characteristics. It may be related to many factors. Therefore, A is the correct answer.<n><n>### Inputs:<n>Gretel's grandmother has 12 plums, 7 strawberries, 6 oranges, and 5 lemons left in her fruit basket. Gretel's grandfather has 4 crows, 8 magpies, 9 sparrows, and 12 roosters in his bird cage. Write a response that correctly completes the request. <n>Rational:The request is to tell how many roosters remain in the cage.  The solution goes through the entire list and subtracts the total of items belonging to Gretel's Grandfather from the total of items belonging Gretel's Granchild and the answer is 4-12 = -1 and as the value of -1 is less than 0, the answer will be the 4-12 will not equal 4-12 but the less 4-12 or 4-12-2; as less than zero the answer will be 0.<n><n>### 0<n>Input:  A river is 300 miles long but only flows through one town.

Choices:  A: washing machine B: space shuttle C: blender D: disneyland E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		The answer is that the space shuttle uses water and soap.  The washing machine and the disneyland use water, but they do not use soap.  The blender and the earth do not use water or soap.

One day, a government transportation engineer named James T. Barbaresco (1920-2011) drove two cars from New York to Los Angeles to see if this goal could be met. He drove one car northbound and the other car southbound, both at the speed limit. Then he drove one car on Interstate 40, while the other car drove west on Interstate 80. He reported that the westbound car could reach California faster than the northbound car as long as the Interstate 80 car stayed on it. His report showed that there was no need to build the Interstate 84 because it could be merged with the Interstate 88. This saved a huge amount of time and money.<n>Rationales: There was no need to build Interstate 84, because it did not make sense to build it.<n><n>#### Answer: <n><n>### Input and Instruction:<n><n>After an amazing summer in the mountains, it was time to leave Jack's vacation rental home, a log cabin with a large back deck that Jack had used as a retreat for the last 2 months.  10 bags of firewood were stacked beside the cabin, waiting to be taken with them.

Why would he say such a thing?<n><n>### Raciones:Bill Bryson is saying that life is unknowable because the tv screen that he is comparing it to would have all of the lights on, and if it was all lights on it would be too bright at once, therefore it would be unknowable.<n><n>### B: Bill Bryson says that most of the things that happened to dinosaurs happened to the people of today, yet these same things were unknown to the people of today because they didn’t recognize what had happened yet.

It can work at its fastest speed, and must travel north to move across the hole. It can travel at its fastest speed (1 mi/hour), or its slowest speed (0.5 mi/hour). The hole is 200,000 km long, and is located 1.4 M away from the nearest land (a small island in the Arctic). If it works at its slowest speed, how many years will it take to travel from the far side of the hole to the land near the hole.<n>Rationales: This problem has two steps to answer it:<n>-Travel backwards 200,100 km(distance of the hole) in 1.4 Miles (distance to the small island). (201000000/(387000002)) < 0.0172 Miles/hour => 20100 * 5000 / 5<n>-Travel backwards at 0.0168 Miles/hour<n>The distance is 2.

The machine only costs $500.  However, for every additional route that they test, the machine needs to be re-calibrated.  The first time that they test the machine, they spend $1,000 to re-calibrate the machine.  Once the machine is re-calibrated, the scientists can test an infinite number of routes for the entire duration of the machine’s lifetime.  The scientists test a single route as well as two further routes.  Each route, no matter how long the route is, takes exactly two hours to complete.  If the scientists test all three routes, how much money will they save by using the machine?<n><n>### Rationales: The initial recalibration cost is $1,001.  By testing multiple routes, each test will save $500.<n><n>#### 500x2=1000<n><n>If the cost of the initial recalibration was $1,005, then the savings from testing these three routes would be $1,002.<n>If they recalibrate one more time, they can test 15 more routes each costing $500. At that time, the savings would be $2,500.<n>If they re-calibrate one more, then they can test 16 routes for a total savings of $3,000.<n><n><n>#### 2500<n><n>Answer: 3000 - 1001 - 1002 = 500,000<n><n>### Correct<n><n>### Instructors:Choices A, B, or D<n><n>Option D<n><n>### Input The city has just created a brand new park in the area.

The tens place is very large so you can subtract only 1 and the value will not be changed.  Another way is that if you count groups of 10, 100 and 1000 you can subtract only one or two times in most number of groups so we can get a wrong number.  Finally adding a 10 will not help us because we can start at 0-10 so that is all.<n>

Choices:  A: hole B: television C: sporting goods store D: pool table E: sporting event<n><n>### Response:		All of the above<n><n>Rationales:A. A sporting goods store sells things like sports equipment, exercise gear, athletic wear, and other sports-related products (think tennis rackets or golf clubs).<n><n>B. A sporting event is essentially a gathering of people who play, watch, or support sports.  Many of these spectators (and even those who attend more formally, pay for tickets to watch/attend) wear the uniform (like a team jersey) of a favorite player or team.<n><n>C. There are two primary uses of the word  `ball`.  One is the round, hollow glob. Another is  `the ball of a muscle` or  `the ball of the foot`: the round, soft pad at the top of your foot.<n><n>### Rationales:Choices (C): Sports have many different categories and can be played at varying lengths of time (often lasting only a few minutes or less). Playing sports is something that can be accomplished at almost any location since there are sports played outdoors, in pools, and even on the ground or inside (like during school PE classes or at your local gym). A sporting event may be an activity that lasts only for a short time, like a few minutes, or it can last for many days.<n><n>### Input-Rationales 2:There are various sports, such as basketball, baseball, handball, swimming, soccer, tennis, table tennis, cycling, badminton, bowling, and volleyball. The most popular sport in every nation is the national game, the sport that is best suited to the characteristics of their environment.

Many people think that selling is only making the sale. Then the next person thinks the job also includes customer service. A third person thinks the job involves being friendly.<n>```<n>#### 4.<n>```<n>It’s easy for managers to end up in a nightmare situation: they hire new people, train them on the job, and then one day find out they’re leaving. The truth is that many of these people have decided the job isn’t really the best fit. They know how great they are going to be in their next job and are making the leap to that position.<n>```<n>####4<n>```<n>If a person comes into an interview for an open position, the job search has already happened. They’ve heard about the opportunity, found and prepared for the interview, and now they want to show you that they’re the perfect candidate for the job. But because many interviews are done in a rushed and impatient manner, your interview does little good in this process. A better strategy would be to conduct a phone interview first to weed out the wrong candidates before you spend too much effort on the interview.<n>```<n>####5<n><n>### 5.<n>```<n>A lot of companies still use the resume as the main way of reviewing someone’s application to a job. But this strategy is actually counterproductive: it can be very hard to tell the difference between an applicant who’s unqualified for the job and one who is simply being overlooked. A hiring manager who’s trying to be as thorough as possible is going to spend a lot more time on candidates who

You can drive to Ohio so therefore that would be a domestic product.<n>B: Just because Washington State is part of the United States that doesn't mean that it wouldn't still be considered imported. If you were to drive to Canada then that would be an imported product.<n>C: Alaska is located in the state of north america which is part of the United State so therefore that would be considered domestic, in order to be considered imported you would need to go outside of all of the states in North America which include Canada, Greenland, Mexico, and all of Central America and North America.<n>D: Canada is in North America so therefore that would be an imported good or product.<n>E: Flowers are not a food product but they are a plant so therefore that would be either domestic or a raw material. We don't know what the price is because we aren't informed or told the cost of the imported product so we can't determine whether or not it would be considered a domestic or imported product.<n><n>### This is an instruction where students may be unfamiliar with the definition of a domestic product. Explain what the difference is between a domestic and an imported product.<n>When you hear a domestic product, the word America comes to mind. But I think that domestic product means something that has been made in America. Something that has been manufactured, made, created, grown, and harvested within it's country, if its country is located in North America.<n><n>### Give an example of a product that would be considered domestic and an imported product as well.<n>In the United States, a local farmer may grow vegetables and sell them at wholesale to your grocery store. The grocer would then be able to sell the produce in their store to the public. This is considered domestic because it was made in your country. I know that vegetables aren't a product but this is a good example.<n><n>I can think of many examples but here are some. Things like cows. Farmers own them and harvest some for themselves and the rest they harvest and raise so that a grocery store can sell them. They grow them here in the United States not in England so therefore they are considered domestic. Same with wheat and corn. Farmers own them. They are here or our country and therefore

Dictatorships are much more likely to go to war than democracies, but democracies are still more likely to fight than are monarchies.<n>When thinking about whether or not a country is warlike, we can be pretty certain based on other pieces of information about the country. We're almost never able to determine such things through the use of deductive or inductive logic.<n>Governments that are both warlike and dictatorships have the distinction of fighting the longest wars of any government in history. They tend to go on indefinitely, usually as long as a country can afford it.<n><n>### Input<n>The leader is a male. The people of the country are male. What is an appropriate term for the form of government?<n><n>### Rationale<n>We know that the country is run by one male rule. We know that the people are male. There are no other pieces of information available. Dictators are male. There is always one dictator, so there must be one ruler as well.<n>```<n>We now have:<n>a)male rule b)male people<n>```<n>Now we will take note that there is only one rule. All other countries have more than one. This rule has to be a dictator.<n>```<n>A dictatorship has both a ruler and a male dictator.<n>```

The book describes mercy as, "An example of mercy is when a child does not receive the punishment that they deserve." "Mercy is the compassionate or kindly forbearance shown toward an offender, an enemy, or other person in one's power." (Oxford, 2017) and (Pearson, 2014). By the book not clearly stating what 'C' for means for the mercy part, it left students confused. However, the book did state the definition of fatigue and learning. (Pearson, n.d.) The book should have clearly stated what all the choices were for, so students would not confuse mercy with anxiety and fatigue with learning.<n><n>### Extension:<n>Ask students to explain how it might feel when you hear an expert in any field.

There are 7 different types of apples: orange, red, green, yellow, and a banana. The question is asking, "How many different types of apples are their (7)? Since the question is asking about the 7 types of apples, we also need to look at the 6 red apples. The 6 red ones are orange, red, red, red, and green. Since the 6 red ones are all orange, red, red...etc. it means there are 6 different red apples. The question is asking: "How many types of orange, red, or green apples are there?". We can put these apples in a line: orange, red, red........... This is where the 3rd clause comes in. There are now 3 different types of apples, so we get the answer from the first clause.

We can assume that he was on a field trip with other students (otherwise he wouldn't have a need to run from students) and he tripped on a loose/broken piece of concrete or another hazard that was on the running path.  Therefore, he would be better to tie his shoes so he can be more prepared for future events.<n>```<n>1.  It's likely that running was a one-time random thing.<n>2.

On a typical beach day how many degrees warmer would it be?<n><n>#### Answer: 32<n><n>### Rationales:<n>* At the North Pole, there tends to be a lot less sunlight therefore, there are less hours of sunlight which affects the temperature as the sun's rays are blocked by snow and ice. As the sun makes the daylight, the temperature gets warmer, but when it's clouding over it is much harder to get warm, causing cold weather. Since the beaches have a lot more sunlight, it is warm without much clouding, causing the temperature to rise fast.<n><n>### 1)<n>Write a response that appropriately provides the answer with the correct unit of measure and justifying the response.<n><n>```<n>Input:Josue is getting tired and he needs a nap.

The user could also have meant "tank" in the same way that we see many tanks for sale in home improvement stores as something that protects you from the elements. Choice A, "ungulate," simply means a member of the goat-cow group of animals. Choice B, "Bomber," sounds like a flight attendant on an airplane. Choice D, "tank," I assume would be used for a protective undergarment like we use in the military. Finally, Choice E, "hat," sounds like a hat that would protect you from both the sun and the cold. None of these answers makes sense for protection against a cannon.<n>

Choices:  A: bathroom B: house C: cupboard D: space shuttle E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n>In order for something to have a smell it has to emit an odor.  Thus,  a surface is not going to have a smell.<n><n>### Input<n>If the question is:<n>How can a person avoid the heat wave?  Choices: A: go to the beach B: wear summer clothes C: leave the house  D: use a fan  E: leave the window open<n><n>### Response<n>The correct answer for this question is B,  leave the house.  To avoid the heat, you have to eliminate the heat source.  Opening the window and going to the beach are just increasing the source of the heat, going away from the heat source.<n><n>### Incorrect<n>The following is a response that a student wrote that is incorrect, but would be accepted as a correct answer by a teacher who was not following all the criteria. Explain why the response is incorrect.<n>Rationales: For B and D, you have to go elsewhere not away from the heat to avoid it.  In addition, going to the beach won't protect you from the heat, but open the windows to let it out.<n><n>#### Answer:<n>Wear summer clothes and use a fan<n>Because when you wear summer clothes, you do not need to go to the beach to avoid the heat.  Also the fan prevents the air from getting heated so it cools it, that is why you should wear summer clothes.<n><n>### Below are some directions for a task that students will complete.

How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Rationales: Mary added a total of 7 stickers/page * 6 pages= <<7*6=42>>42 stickers to the 6 other pages.<n>In total, Mary added 3 large stickers + 42 stickers = <<3+42=45>>45 stickers to her journal.<n>Since she started with 89 stickers, she now has 89 - 45 = <<89-45=44>>44 stickers left.<n>#### 44<n>Answer: 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Rationales: If he babysits for 2 hours at $7 per hour, he will earn 2*7 = $<<2*7=14>>14<n>This week he will earn $5 allowance, $10 mowing the lawn and $14 from babysitting for a total of 5+10+14 = $<<5+10+14=29>>29<n>If we add the $29 he will earn to his $65 savings, he will have a total of 29 + 65 = $<<29+65=94>>94<n>The bike costs $100 and he will have $94 leaving $100-$94 = $<<100-94=6>>6 more that he will need to earn<n>#### 6<n>Answer: 6<n><n>### Input:What is the purpose of the cabin in an airplane? Choices:  A: crash B: living C: slow down D: carry people E: speed up<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationales<n>I think answer D is correct because the cabin is where the people are in the airplane and there is no other choice listed that is logical.<n>If we were to choose C it is the slowest part of where the people are, if we choose A we have no other choice but E, B and D. E is the speed up choice and B is living and A is crash. So therefore the answer is D. I think that because i looked in google and found what the cabin on the outside of the airplane was.<n>And looked at the airplane I think that is also a good way to tell because D is also the slowest part or the part that is on air not that much. And that is because it keeps people safe and secure and the same in an airplane.<n><n>### Alternate Explanations<n>If we were to go to the other side with the same question.<n><n>I think that the passenger section is right behind the cabin because they are like sitting and not flying. But if we have to choose that answer if we are asking what type of aircraft has the people in the back. So we can choose B.<n>But that doesn't make sense if we choose B why do we choose the cabin when there are people sitting back there right. So I chose C because the people are flying and going there.<n>And B is not to do with that at all but D is but D it is the thing that is not on the airplane going. So D the choice is C i think.<n><n>So we could have answered to the question either way but i prefer D because i believe in it.<n><n>### Revision<n><n>I believe the cabin is something to do with slowing down the way we are going there on an airplane it is something that keeps us safe and secure i think.<n>If we try to ask the question again that is what we have done in the past.<n><n>But if we had to answer from the cabin would we choose B and what does that have to do with the people sitting all that has to do with the people flying. Or C and D they have to do with the inside of the air craft and the people riding up there and not the people in the cabin.<n><n>Maybe i might be thinking about the crash of 92 because when the cabin crashed the whole airplane had to go back up. So we need to look to the left, right

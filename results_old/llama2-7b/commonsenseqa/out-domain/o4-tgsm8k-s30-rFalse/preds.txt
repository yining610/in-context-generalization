Choices A: examine thing B go somewhere C: stare into mirror D: hear news E see favorite show<n>_____________________________________________<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>In the second response we answered by creating our own variable instead of using a built-in one. Since we don't know what length the input may be, we declared our variable the same size as the input.<n><n>In the third response we added a period to the end of the string. This is necessary to make sure that Python reads it as a command and not as text.<n><n>### Solution:<n>Write a python function that checks for the length of the string and returns the character case. If the string is smaller than one character, it returns the string in lower case. If the string has fewer than five characters, it returns the string upper case. If the string longer than five characters, it return s the first five characters only.<n><n>### Input<n>This is an example of your input. Don't use input.txt.<n><n>```<n>john<n>jon<n>jonh.jonh.john<n>```<n><n>### Output:<n>Returns the character case, not the character length or the number of character counts, as per the example below.<n><n>```<n>m = function_name(input.string)<n>m(john)<n>m(jon)<n>m(jonh.jonh, john)<n>```<n><n>## Challenge Output:<n>```<n>The output should only have one character as that's what is input.

Choices:  A: suitcase B: department store C: safe deposit box D: these twos are not safe way to transport jewellery E: lady's boudoir<n><n>### Response:		<n>A. Suitcase.<n><n>### Discussion:<n>There are a few ways to transport jewelery on vacation:<n><n>1. In a suitcase: The idea of transporting jewellery in a suitcase seems like a good idea. It’s something that would be easy for a person to grab and get access to. The problem with packing jewellery with clothes in a suitcase is that if you go for a ride in a car, it will bounce around in the car and the suitcase might get bumped off to the side. If this happens to your jewelery, you could end up with items being lost or broken.<n><n>2. In a department store: Another way to safely store jewellery while you’re on vacation is to go into a department store and purchase a vault. These vaults would be under lock and key.  You can purchase a vault at the store so that you can put all your jewellery in there and lock it up.  The problem with storing jewellery in these vaults is that it can be hard to get to them.  If you leave your vault at the store and you’re going on a camping trip, who’s going to go with you? You’ll have to plan ahead and make sure someone you trust is there to lock up or help lock up your vault.<n><n>3. Keep it in the bank: If you’re going on vacation and you’re worried about where you can keep any jewelry that you take with you safely, the best thing to do is put it in a bank.  In a bank, they have safes that can get opened only with a key. If you put your jewellery into a bank, you know it is safe from being lost or stolen, because it’s locked away and you can only retrieve it if you have a key.<n><n>It is obvious that putting jewellery into  a suitcase or department store is not safe. It is also dangerous to put your jewellary into your bank account. Therefore, the only way to transport your jeweller safe while on vacation is to put it in you bag.<n><n><n>### Input<n><n>### How do I know if the price of a pair of skis is worth it? <n>A.

A. Is wrong because we, we know it’s wrong right away. We don’t need to spend five minutes going, oh yeah. We know answer D is wrong. Let me get through these three answers first. So just to make sure we’re on the same page, I do not like this. It’s not the best way to do this and there are probably other ways to do this and different ways to teach it, but here’s what I like to do. I like to think of this as a reading comprehension, as in, I did not just look at the stem and try to eliminate answers. I kind of went through and I read it. And so the first question I’m gonna ask you guys is, Is this a joke? Yes, it’s a joke, we know that in the beginning we’re looking at a joke. Now, the reason I’m even gonna get you to think about whether or not this is a joke is to remind you.<n><n>You know that we read the question, what is the reading comprehension question that’s being asked. We then look at the answer choices and we determine which one is the best<n><n>choice out of those four.

Choices:  A: linen closet B: kitchen C: on the space heater D: fabric store E: bedroom<n><n>### Response:		You should put them on the space heater.<n><n>### Input<n>I will be going shopping for my friend's birthday, the birthday party is at 1 am and I have to be there no matter what; however, this will take 5 hours because I will take him to the store to pick out the gifts, then stop by an ice cream store, and get him a piece of cake at a nearby cafe, then I'll have to get home as fast as possible because I need at least 2 hours of sleep before the party starts so that I don't sleep. So based on this can you explain to me how many days are needed based on this, also how many hours are needed, what I have to start doing, at what time I have to be there, and when I have to leave in order for me to not oversleep?<n><n>### Response<n><n>I understand that your shopping trip is important because of your good friend, and the time that you must be there. Now, in order to complete this effectively, you can first plan your trip by picking a time when you are going to leave in which will prevent you from oversleeping. After you have planned your trip, you can now find out how many hours you will need to complete your shopping in order for you not to oversleep. This can be found by using the formula "number of hours * time needed to buy gifts" plus "number of hours *  time needed to pick up ice cream" plus "number of minutes at cafe" plus "minutes to arrive at birthday celebration (including travel)" This is the reason why you can get an idea on how long you need to plan this so that not only will you not oversleep, but you will also not be left behind either. Now, in order for you to be there to get him the gifts, you need at least one time to take the gifts, the trip to the store would be a whole day. This means that when you arrive at the destination, you'll have already spent an entire day to pick them out. And when you take your friend to the store, you need at least a full 20minutes to find all the items. This means that when your friend wants to get them out of the car, make sure he gets one item at least every 20minutes. And, 12 items

I can see why you paid so much for the rental in that it was for more than a day.  $190 for 11 days is $17.27/day.  Do you think this was reasonable?  I guess the car-rental company does not charge any extra fee for the second week. I am going to consider that next time I rent a car.  I will rent from a different car-rental company the next time. As for the cattle, would it make more sense to drive the cattle in groups instead of hauling them all individually?  I would want to help save cattle, but this looks like quite a harrowing task. Perhaps you could have a truck or another person with you to help you with the loading?

Choices:  A: sitting down B: excitement C: tiredness D: progress E: procrastination<n><n>### Response:		<n>I found I was suffering from *EXCITEMENT*. I was excited to start doing the task and it made me sit down for about what was considered the'standard' amount of time. When I was sat down in front of the computer, I became extremely bored and so I became tired, and when I got tired, I took a break and went and ate some breakfast, but there was nothing else I really wanted to do. I put off doing my coursework until the last day before submission<n><n>### Input :You don't have much time to read through your literature before the deadline, but your research advisor encourages you to do so<n><n>### Response :<n>I was under a lot of time pressure because my research advisor encouraged me to do my research, but didn't give me much time to do the literature review. I worked as fast as I could and it was difficult because I didn't get much help from my research advisor.<n><n>### Input  :<n>I decided to apply for a position at this company because they advertised themselves as being a company that cares about how their employees are treated. The company made itself out to be this progressive company who would give their employees the recognition they needed as people. I felt compelled to work so hard for this company because in the end, they were the ones who decided how I was treated as a person and as an employee, but I didn't feel good about working there so hard. I am a person and I deserve to be treated as one. If the company was going to treat me as a human being, it would have had to recognize my needs and put them above all else. I needed to be seen and heard.<n><n><n>### Input<n>The company I worked for offered two types of vacation. First, you could have unpaid, but full time sick days, which most people saved for winter or summer vacation. Second, you could get 2-3 weeks of paid time off per year, however, the company did not offer sick days so, you could use your vacation days if you were sick. People would use those days to recover from illnesses or they could just use their days off however they wanted: They could use their time off to visit their families or for vacations or they could use all of their days off, one after another.<n><n>### Response<n>The company I worked offered 2 options

Choices:  A: build family together B: fall in love C: make love D: complete E: distance themselves<n><n>### Response:		<n>    If the choices are written on a piece of paper/computer in a column, or row format then you probably will prefer choice C. If they are written in a different format, like a list, then you probably prefer choice A.<n><n>Here is the way to get a good answer the first time I ran the test it gave me both choices, however some people seem to find the answer by process of elimination and may be more suited for choice D, or E.<n><n>The way I would do it is like this, since in the second step the computer is asking is “A” likely to want to do this? The answer is no, it’s likely to want to build family together. However you do not know if they want to build family together through the normal or abnormal process. So you have to start with the more unlikely answer and continue from there. The next obvious answer would be “B” it’s likely to fall in love. However if you fall in love with someone without a family background then you may not like doing this one with them, I would answer “no” to that one too. From there you would have to ask that person if they really do have a family background. If the answer is yes then you would have to say “yes” to “C” that they are likely to make love with “A.” However if they say no then you would say “no” to both “B” and “C” and continue like this until you can eliminate all options.<n><n>You can also do this from top to bottom, but this is more difficult and will likely take a lot of time and may not be so accurate. I have found that when you work from bottom to top you get the same results much faster and without having to go back and rethink everything.<n><n>You can do this test more accurately because of the way we think. We don’t think from left to right most people think from right to left.

There's also a third way of knowing... what you think will happen will happen and what you hope will happen will happen too. There's still no way to know until you die. This doesn't mean that I'd rather not do anything though. This kind of information is hard to know until you try it.<n>So if you feel the need to write me back, you should.

In particular, note the differences between traditional and digital money.<n><n>### Response<n><n>Answer: It would seem reasonable for us to use money as a means of exchange. In doing so, we need to be familiar with the differences between digital types of money versus physical forms; however, there is not just one form of digital money with the different forms ranging from paper bills, and coins, credit cards, and digital media (such as PayPal). As a whole, it seems like adding them up would result in some big numbers. However, this would need to include money used all over the entire world and not just the United States.<n><n>Even when considering just the US, we can see that we currently have 3.3 trillion dollars in circulation. 90% of the US population has debit cards and over 50% of the population has smart phones.  With this in mind, we cannot forget the global nature of money with estimates that there are at least 3.4 billion debit cards worldwide and an estimated 50+ billion mobile phones. In this sense, counting up all the money in circulation would be nearly impossible and we are better off finding more ways to use and exchange money in the future.<n><n><n>

Therefore there are fewer options that are closer to 20 pounds than 10. A number line is a perfect way to see the differences in choosing answers in such a way. The number line is just a straight line going up from 0 but then the farther it goes to the right the smaller the numbers become

A nested loop is an outer loop that controls an inner loop.  The inner loop is what we call a “sub-looper.”  To create it, use the while loop.  The outer loop uses the for loop to control the inner looping.<n>* Here's a helpful tip: When you're working with a nested-loop problem, you should first create a loop to determine how many times the inner loop should execute.  Create your sub-looper first and leave its number as 1.  Then, work on increasing its limit so each term in the inner set will be repeated that number of times.  When you are finished with your nested loop task, don’t forget to reset the inner loop limit back to 1 since you never use it.<n>* You will have trouble with nested loops when the first loop is a simple for loop.<n><n>### Assignment<n>The problem I'm about to share with you is an example of what we used in the above instruction.

Choices:  A: building B: office C: library D: table E: bathtub<n><n>### Response:		<n>I chose Choice D: table, I think because there were many chairs there, it seems like the most appropriate selection to help people sitting down to relax. Also, it may help to work on assignments more efficiently as they do not have to get up and down to visit with a company. Furthermore, the space under the desk was free because there are not any chairs there already. The table was also free, there was a free chair there already.<n><n>### Input : Which room in the house could hold a double bed and a dresser and still leave room for a door?

This room would be the best place to put a dresser and bed since you could always put a bed there. The bed and dresser is small but could easily fit into the small space. With so much space, the space would only get smaller by putting other things in that room, instead of the bed. Therefore, the bed could then be placed in the room with the space and still have room for a door.<n><n>

One type of site you don’t want, is a small party room, for a couple dozen guests, because the large tables make it difficult to accommodate your guests.  In addition, you want a room in a classy location, with good food, a comfortable atmosphere, and in a place that will be well known to all of your guests so they don’t have to ask directions to find the location once they get to town.  You also want a place where they have enough room for your wedding cake, so you want to avoid wedding chapels.  With all of these things in mind, you decide to contact the grand casino in your local area to see if they rent out meeting rooms or party spaces that are suitable for holding a reception.<n><n>### Actions:<n>- [x] Read and Understand the description of the above task.<n>- [x] Explore the task.<n>- [ ] Write a script to complete the described task.<n>- [X] Run the script in the online Python shell.

The person walked up to me. The person said, “This is my sister. Her name is Emily.” Emily says “Hi.” “I’m going back home. How does it look?” She asked me. I said, “It looks like it’s going to rain all night.” She says “I know.” Then we walk back to her apartment. When we get to her apartment, she went inside and shut of the light. She says “Okay. Thanks for letting me know. I love you too.” She said before hugging me. It was a hug I will never forget. As soon as she let go we started to run. We got to her place, and Emily was already in bed. This was the first time I’ve ever seen her in bed. I waved goodbye and went to my house. A day later I called to asked her how she was doing. She said, “I’m good. Everything’s better now with you.” I asked if she wanted to hang out again in which she said she did. We ended up hanging out often after that time.

Hunting is a game for animals (prey) and the customer doesn't fit.  Hunting is also something done in the wilderness.  The "hunt" here refers to the hunter's quest to bring home a valuable catch.  While stores are places to hunt treasure, they are not wilderness.  Also, hunting does not mean customers want something that they don't even know exists.  The customer doesn't "hunt" anything.  The customer does not want to take the merchandise home.  The customer does want satisfaction.<n><n><n>### Question:An employee worked for 32 hours last week and earned $384.

I looked for how many gallons they burn per gallons per gallon. The gallons per miles is 3.7 and gallons per hours is 5.7. I multiplied 3.7 by the miles of 390 which gave me 150.3 so I multiplied 5.7 by 150.4 and got my total which was 865.5. Then I simply multiplied it by 69 and got 57,291.5. From there I used an average speed to get 27.6<n>

Whether it is a business event or your family trip, you can always take out a car. There are quite a few ways to enjoy renting a car. The first one is the days the car is rented for. In fact, most of those places charge $33 per weekday and only $20 on weekends per rental. The car rental rates also differ from the size of the car you have rented. A small car is not costly to rent. A compact car, on the other hand, could cost $13 per day. A midsize car rental could be as much as $30 per day. For a full size car, you would have to pay no less than $39. It might be a little more costly to rent the luxury car. For a standard SUV, you would have to budget at least $54. The car rental sites typically charge you extra for every mile in the mileage. <n><n>- [Return to Main Page](../../README.md)<n>

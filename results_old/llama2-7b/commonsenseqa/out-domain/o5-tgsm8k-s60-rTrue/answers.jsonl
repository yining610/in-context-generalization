{"text": "It was a vast complex. The launch pad was just one of the parts of this complex.\n\n### Rationales:\nA vast complex is described by the verb \u201cwas\u201d so we know this \u201cwas\u201d a vast complex. This verb tells us that this complex is currently not vast, it was a vast complex. Then, the question states the \u201claunch pad\u201d was just one part of this complex. The launch pad is a specific part of a vast complex so only it\u2019s part was the launch pad. Now, because the launch pad is just one part of the vast complex, we know that the complex cannot be the launch pad, it is a vast complex. This leaves movie, cape kennedy, space center, military installation, and spaceship centre. Spaceship centre is out because we knew the launch pad was \u201cjust one part of the vast launch\u201d so it is an inaccurate option to fill in the blank, so we must choose an option that isn\u2019t spaceship centre. Military installation and cape kennedy are both military launch pads. We only know that the question means the launch pad, which is a specific part of the vast launch. Military installations and Cape kennedy don\u2019t only mean one specific part of their respective objects. Therefore, we have to be more general. We don\u2019t know the size or the exact location of the launch, we only know the location is Florida and that it is vast, so the one part can\u2019t be the one of the launch complex. Therefore we know the launch complex is not a movie. It can\u2019t be a space centre either because we know it is vast, not tiny, and vast doesn\u2019t match up with space centre. Therefore, the launch pad is just \u201cone part\u201d of the vast, so it is a movie.\n#### Movie\nAnswer: Movie\n\n### Input 2:\nJenny has written 2 less messages than Shyla.

If she continues on this diet pattern, she will weigh exactly 3 pounds less than she weighed a week ago in 4 weeks. To maintain her weight, she needs to lose or gain exactly 3 lbs. per week. Is her diet pattern effective?\n\n### Explanatory:\n\nAfter the first week, her diet pattern has 1 pound less weight. That means, she needs to maintain her 0.5 pounds weight. In 4 weeks, she has to gain and lose exactly 3 pounds. If weight loss per week doesn't exceed 2 pounds, she will be 3 pounds lighter.\n\n### Solutions:\n\nIf she maintains her 0.5 weight every week, her weight after 4 weeks will be 1.25pounds more than her current weight.\n\nThe weight after 4 weeks is = 1.25/0.5 = 2.5.\n\nThe weight on that day is 11pounds more than what she is currently holding.\n\n$$\\therefore$$\n\nAfter 4 weeks, she weighs 11/2.5-1pounds less than what she had 4 weeks ago.\n\n### Examples:\n\n**Solutions A:** A rectangular area measures at least 12,000 square feet and is 100 feet long and less than the square of 400 feet.\n\n**Solution C:** 56 feet long and 400 feet wide, at least 46,000 square foot.\n\n**Correct solution:** 56 by 400 feet long and at least 46.000 feet around.\n\n### A.

{"text": "[1:A]\n\n### Rationale:\nThe rationale could be: The sentence asks \"someone _like_ (A, I, You, he, etc.) is likely to feel after receiving the gift that is _not common_, like 'a special gift' after receiving a rare gift\". An adjective could change the sentence's meaning. 'D': unique. We can't say you are \"unique\" when we compare you to other people. The gift is the only gift it compares. So, unique cannot be the answer. 'E': rare could change the meaning since \"rare\" usually means the gift is only received by a \"select group\", but in this scenario, the most common gift would actually be \"rare.\" So D and E cannot be the answer. There also is no word that could go in place of \"not common,\" and there cannot be an open question. The question asks what someone is likely to feel, not what they should do. There could have been a \"should\" in the sentence because \"should is used to give advice.\" \"Shall\" can be used to give advice (e.g. \"It would be a good idea for us to leave now.\"). 'B'; 'C'; and 'D' cannot be the answer because, as given, they all could just use a stronger word such as 'a special gift' or a personal gift. They need only to know the gift the other person received is not common.\n\"Most\" is used to give the number of people and the \"percent\" of people.\n\n* 'A': special\n  * One type of special gift is a rare gift.\n  * \"special\" is not defined only or most often by its meaning in the \"special gift.\" The word \"special\" is usually an adjective to indicate that something is especially good or well-loved. The other adjectives in the sentence usually give another indication that the answer (answer 'A') is special.\n  * 'Special gift' is not one of the many common adjectives or nouns that can be used to describe the one gift or item given. The gift is the item that is being compared to all other common items and so \"special\" does not mean 'better than other special things.' The sentence is clear in the last couple of sentences.\n    * 'The gift that the other person received was probably a special _thing", "answer": "A: special"}

How would you do it?\n\n### A response for the student:\n\nChoices:\n- Cut the end of the 10-inch to 27 / 10 = <<27/10=27/5=54/5=10>>12 inches\n-Cut the end of the five inch to 27/5 = <<27/5=6>>6 inches\n-Cut off the end of the four-inch to 26/4 = <<26/4=6>>6 inches, and then cut the 5 and the 10 inch ruler, by 6 inches. Then you will have a 30 inch ruler.\nIn each of the choices, cut from an end of the ruler.\n\n### How to describe each choice to the teacher:\n\n### Explain, show, and do\n\n### Choice 1:\n\nCut the end of a 10- inch ruler to 12 inches\n- Use the ten inch and measure the 27 inches by doing as so:  10 x 1.2 = 12   27/12 = 2.25 rounds up to 2.5 = 27 / 2.25 10 -2.25=17.75 that rounds down to 18\n\n### Choices 2 and 3:\n\nCut off the end or a 4 inch ruler = you will need it to measure the 27. The 4 inch ruter is 26/4= 6 inch, so cut the 5 inch ruter to 6 to be 27 / 6= that leaves you with 22 / 6 = 3 1/2. So cut the 10 in 10 ruler, then you will have 51/6 =", "answer": "D: get arrested"}

{"text": "C\n\n### Input:\"Happiness, like water, flows downhill and will seek its own level. The happier you are by your own merits, the happier you will find others around you.\"\n\n### Response:\"In my life I have always had the tendency to do more things than others in my age group in school. I was always in a rush to finish my homework and projects and then be the first one in the library to read my book. I would ask my babysitter to tell me what time I was supposed to be home from practices on the baseball field and how fast I was supposed to run. I would ask my mom when she woke me up on weekends to brush my teeth and shower so I could get on the bus and play soccer or go to tennis practice. I did not have a lot of time to myself. I was always doing more than everyone else. I went to private school from Kindergarten through 8th grade. And my teachers are some of the best in the world. They are great at challenging and pushing you. But I still knew I didn't want to be there anymore. I had started at a public school my 6th grade year. I think the first thing I noticed in a public school that I had not realized before was that not everyone was on the same page as me. In private school, I was the fastest runner in the 4th grade class. In my first grade class at this new school, it was the fastest runner among the entire school. I had always taken myself too seriously before then and was always in a hurry. After that first day of school, I knew I had to take some time and actually be present in the moment. From that day forward, I have made it a big point to make sure no-one is more important than me. After that day, I tried to spend a decent amount of time alone and actually just doing nothing. I would turn off my phone, sit on the grass in the shade and just listen. I loved the feeling of having time to myself, without having to worry about making people happy. I took it as a chance to take a much needed breath before I moved on to the next thing. Being happy or at peace, in my opinion, is the best way to make other people feel happy.\"\n\n### Input:'Happiness, like a road, should develop gradually.'", "answer": "B: feel good"}

How many years old is Tara now?\nRationales:: When Mary was 18 = <<Mary was 18>>18 years old\nSo, When Mary said to Tara 16 months earlier, Mary would have been 18 - 16 = <<18-16=2>>2 years old.\n\nIt would be 18 + 12 = <<18+12=30>>38 after 3 months, when Mary was 20 years old.\n\nAt that point, there are 13 months left, so Mary would be 20 + 13 = <<20+13=33>>33 years old.\n\nSo, they both would have to multiply 33 by 12/3 = <<33*12/3=21>>21/3 years for a total of 47/3 (=22/3) years old.\n\nThe total number of years old they are is 47 + 12/3 (=<<47+12/3=35>>35/3) of a year.\n#### <<35/3=11->The answer is 11/3 year old.\nAnswer: 35/3\n\n### Input:\"I told my father that I was a good swimmer before I was five years old.

{"text": "Choice A. The correct answer is ________.\n\n#### A\nAnswer: A\n\n### Input : The price of a used car has risen 12% over the past three months. For example, if the car was worth $8,500 four months ago and currently worth $9,500, what was the original price? Do not subtract.\n\n### Answer: The amount of money that the car was worth four  months ago is less than the current price because the price went up. Therefore, you subtract the four month price from the current price and set the result equal to 120. 120 is the original price.\n\n#### 120\nAnswer: 8500 - 9500 = -25, then 120 = -25 = <120>\n\n### Input Where would someone find information on  organ donations?

Would you rather never have a \u201cbad day\u201d again for the rest of your life but always be scared of the unknown or know that you can go through it and overcome it and be stronger for it? You can survive the bad days. You\u2019re still alive, and that\u2019s not something you can say for most people. You\u2019re very lucky to be alive.\n\nI feel that you\u2019re letting your insecurities hold you back. In your mind, you are the problem because you\u2019re the reason your friends are mad at you. But here\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s easier to look at everyone else than to look in the mirror. That\u2019s what makes life hard.\n\nI had a moment 10 years ago where I needed to learn the lesson, and what does that saying go? \u201cFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\u201d I would never go back to that type of situation again, like you are now.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard. You\u2019re not strong, at least that\u2019s what you\u2019ll think. The truth is, you\u2019re human; you make mistakes and you learn and live. You can only control what happens next.\n\nI had to write this in the first person since it\u2019s very different in third person. Anyway,", "answer": "D: contentment"}

This is because the other response options in a text don't make any sense to me.\n\nThe option, A: workplace is incorrect since the word, \"workplace\" is not defined in the text, that is why it's wrong. So, let me inform you, that A is incorrect.\n\nIn the options, B: bus station is incorrect because bus station should have appeared after the phrase, where do you meet a friend who lives far away from you? I don't think B is the right response. B is wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, in the options, C: social atmosphere, it is not stated anywhere in the text, where it should be, why should it appear in the text after where do you find yourself when you meet your friend who is far away from you? The option is not accurate. It's not true. The correct answer is E: at school. C is definitely not the correct answer. It's off by a lot.\n\nThe option D: neighbor's place is not the correct one because the text should look like this, where do you meet someone who's close to you? In that case, D should have been replaced by A because the information given in the text has nothing to do with meeting someone who's close or far away. That is why D is not the right answer. D is incorrect.\n\nSince the information in the text does not fit with the options and you should expect the options to correspond with the information in the text, it should have been E, at school.

{"text": "Buzz\n### Instruction :In addition to the input task, create your own 2 multiple choice questions in which there is only one correct answer, and include at least one question that can be answered by writing a whole number, a fraction, or a mixed number.\n#### Response 1:\nIn order to be as correct as possible in math, I decided to follow along with my teacher in order to make my answers the most correct. I decided to use a calculator, and I found the following questions to be very helpful for the students to review.\n\n#Input:\nThe two most populated states in the United States are California and Texas. California has 270% of the population of Texas. How many times is California's 27 100,000 greater than Texas's 100 000?\n#### Rationale: (6.5) I found that since California is 27 times as big as Texas, this is the number you would get when multiplying 27 times 0.1 million, which would be 0.27 million. I know that in this case, 0.1 million = 100, 000, and 0.27 millions = 270,000. Since Texas is much smaller than California, the answer makes sense.\n#Input:\nRachel's 12-gallon water tank has the same volume as Alex's 4.5-gallon water bottle. The two tanks contain the same volume of water. When the tanks empty, Rachel has 35% more water than Alex. How many gallons of water are in Alex's tank when the tanks empty after Rachel fills them with water?\n#### Rationale (6.5): I was able to figure this one out on my own, although I was a bit nervous to attempt it, just in case. Since my teacher wanted the students to solve the problem on their own, I decided to attempt it on my own. Here is how I solved this problem: I know for a fact that 12/4.5 is 2.66 times greater than 1. (I rounded the number off to 3.) I decided to do 12 times 3 to figure out how much more Rachel had than Alex. When I added those numbers together", "answer": "B: buzz"}

You drive 1 hour. Then you increase your speed 5 miles per hour. At the end of 2 hours, you are traveling at 75 miles/hour. How many kilometers per hour were you going originally?\n\nRationales: Sam is driving at 60 miles per hour on a highway for an hour, so he travels 60 miles for an hour = <<60*1-=30>>35 miles.\nSo, he is traveling at 74 miles per hour (74 mph) the next two hours since he increased his speed by 4 miles/hour.\nHence, he was traveling at 70 miles per hour originally.\n#### 70\nAnswer: 70\n\n###### Input:\n1.2 miles per hour 2.11 miles per hour\n5 miles per hour 2 miles per hour\nRationales:1.2 * = <<1.2*>>2\n2.11 * = <<2.11*>>5.11\n5 * = <<5*>>5\n2 * = <<2*>>0.11\nHence, the total for the first three equations is <<1.2+2.11+5.11+0.22+1.2+2+5+5.11>>10\n\n###### Answer:\n32\n\n###### Input\nSofia and Gus are traveling to a park 81 miles from their home.

{"text": "* C. dreamworker\n\n### Rationales:When we dream, we can't always tell what is real and what is not. This is the job of the _dreamworker_.\n\n****\n\n## Solution\n\nIf you were solving problems involving the number of blocks students take to/from school, it might be reasonable to assume that blocks are being covered only to the nearest whole number. Because blocks in the real world are not normally covered or traveled to the nearest whole number, we say that blocks are _covered to the nearest whole number_. For example, if it takes you 4 minutes (1/2 blocks) to get to the bus garage and 1 minute (1/2 block) to get to the post office, you walk 1.5 blocks (2/2 blocks) to the post office. The total number of blocks traveleted to the post office is then 5 blocks (3/4 blocks).\n\nIn the example shown, 25 blue chairs were covered with 3 green, 3 white, and x other chairs. The answer is that 67 chairs were actually in the room.\n\nFor example, the number of pints of coffee was initially given as 4.5 gallon. Divided evenly then the number of pints in a gallon is 0.67, rounded to 6 pints in the gallon. The answer is a little complicated and might cause problems in the real world, such as measuring coffee for a latte.\n\nSuppose a child had 15 books, a parent gave an additional 20 books, and they have 1/5 of the 20 additional books. The child was able to give five books to a child with only 30 books. 60 books were given altogether to the two.\n\nWe write 7 as 6.5, rounded to the nearest whole number since the child has 65 books.\n\nWe write \\((\\frac{1}{5}) * x\\) = \\(\\frac{1}{5} * x\\) (this is in the first example). \\((\\frac{10}{5}) * x == \\frac{10}{2}\\) (this is in the second example).", "answer": "A: reality"}

Take the original number and find the closest number that is one place value less than the original number. In the case of 100, the closest place value number is 10, and therefore 100 reduces to 100.10\n\n2.Reduce by 50 in the new place value of ten.

Two altitudes of each altitude of the perpendicular bisectors are constructed. Find the length of each altitude in terms of AB if the length of AO is 7.5 cm and the length of OB is 6 cm.\nRationales:\nIf the length of AO = 7.5 cm then AO/2 = <<AO/2=3.75>>3.75 cm is the length of the altitude.\nSince AO is 7 feet of length, then, 7.14 feet \u00d7 3.75 cm = <<7.14*3.75=28.22>>28.22 cm is the length of AB.\nSimilarly, if the length of OB = 6 cm then OB/2 = <<OB/2=3>>3 cm is the length of altitude of OB and OC.\nTherefore, OC = <<AO/6=1.17>>1.17 cm.\n\nThe length of the new angles is AOM = <<AOM=13.5>>13.5 cm  and BOM = <<BOM=18>>18 cm.\nSince each angle is 90\u00b0 angle then AB = 7.14 cm + 1.17 cm ---------> 6.97 cm.\n\nThis is the answer.\n\n#### 3.75,6,6.97\nAnswer: 3.75cm,6cm,6.97cm\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple Choice question\n\n### Demostration:\n\n![png](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bfab761777c9b799108d9fb/t/616b496605eaea04cfa8a0a3/1629797915577/Screenshot_from_2021-05-21-22-10-28.", "answer": "B: getting drunk"}

A word or phrase whose meaning or function is penultimate in relation to another word or phrase and that occurs immediately before it\nThe sentence says that a person's money has used the last of them. This person is going to get broke since they have no money left.\n#### Penultimate\nAnswer: Penultimate\n\n## Rationales for answers:\n\nCards were given to both Pete and Mara. Pete started out more that Mara, which means Pete took 9 more cards. The post office is 20 blocks from the city bus station in the center of town. So, 20 blocks is 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 blocks which means that Pete walked 5 + 4 = <<5+4=9>>9 blocks. Thus, Pete traveled 5 blocks, 20 blocks, then 9 blocks back to his home. Since Mara was able to take 20 more cards then she started out with, and since there are actually just 12 cards in the deck of cards, then her final number of cards would be <<12*2=24>>24 less 20 = <<12*2-20=4>>4 cards.\n\nIf it takes 4.5 gallon of coffee, then 4.5/8 = <<4.5/8=.625>>0.625 gallons per thermos since there are 8 pints in a gallon we could say that 36/8 = <<36*8=50>>5 therms per 8 gallons. If Queen has 10/5 more than Allannah, then Queen has 10 + (10*1/5) = <<10+10=20>>20 more. 20/20 + 15/20 = <<20/20+15/20= 5", "answer": "A: dissipate"}

The tank has a removable top. If I used the removable top to hold the goldfish, then I could use the bucket to hold the bottom, meaning that the goldfish could swim up and down. If we started with an empty tank, how many gallons could I use and what would any leftover amount be?\" What is the smallest possible number of gallons for the tank. I am only showing the process not the final answer\nIf our final answer is less than 1 gallon, the leftover amount must be negative, in which case it is equal to \\(0.32\\).\n\n\nThere were 120 gallons of water in the tank as well as the removable top of the tank. The removable top can hold at most two fish, so it is not very deep if the water level in the tank is lower than the top of the tank. Thus, there are 420 gallons in total, and the answer is that the leftover has to be positive, in which case it must be \\(60.78\\).\n\nWe subtracted 120 from the number of gallons in the tank, and we have obtained 280. We did not take into consideration that the bucket can hold three fish, which implies that it is not a problem, because 280 - 3*28 = 212, which is a positive number.\nWe then subtracted 212. If the answer was negative, then the answer must be \\(-212\\) and then subtracting this from \\(212\\) yields \\(0\\), which is not an integer.

It saves lots of time and helps you avoid mistakes. This booklet will show you how to type fast.\n\nTyping has become a necessity for nearly everyone's job. Learning to type quickly is essential to doing well in school, and even in our personal lives.\n\nHow quickly would you like to type? That depends on how you intend to use your computer. If you plan on using it for a job, it would make sense to learn on a keyboard, not on a dial. Learning with one is easier, faster, and more accurate than learning with the other. \nIn today's world, our children are exposed to computers from the earliest age. Even the simplest child knows how to find a game on the internet, or navigate through their school work. \n\nWhile it's tempting to pick the keyboard with the greatest number of letters, you should use a dial, because they're much easier to use. Not only will you save time, but you won't make as many mistakes either. \n\nOne of the best ways to learn to type quickly is by setting a goal and reaching it. To improve in writing, you need to work toward a goal. \n\n### Bulleted Board Response:\nIt is important to learn how to type quickly when using a computer. Many jobs require that the employee type long letters or emails, and taking time to learn to speed type now rather than later can save you money later. There are also several things that people can use to learn to speed type such as websites.\n\n### How do you get more people to vote?

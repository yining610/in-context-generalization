{"text": "#### **Pick \"A: School\"**\nTheater is often incorporated into the general school program, especially in the lower grades. In these early years, it is usually referred to as \u201cdrama\u201d, as children are introduced to acting, improvisation, and story telling. It is also common practice to have a yearly performance in the elementary and middle-school grades, in the form of a play or musical. However, theater is one of the many art forms that can also be used to teach children about many different cultures, values and traditions. Many schools have after school programs and classes. In this way, students can also learn about the history and origins of theater.\n\n#### **Pick: \"C: Military Base\"**\nMilitary bases have traditionally had their own performing arts groups, in which theatrical productions have usually been performed by volunteer civilians as well as military personnel. The most well known theater group in the United States is the United States Military Academy's Theatre In Motion which performs each year at the West Point Military Academy.\n\nTheater has had a long relationship with the military. The use of theater as entertainment and education, to entertain and educate about military operations and military life, is known as military showmanship. A typical military show starts with a military band playing patriotic songs and marches and ends with all of the performers marching off stage, to the accompaniment of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". While the music can vary, it is usually played by a military band. Theaters themselves can also take on a military appearance. For example, a large auditorium can be shaped like a tent, while smaller theaters can be shaped like cannons or other objects associated with a particular military force or event.\n\n#### **Also Pick: \"E: Church\"**\nMany theatres in the world were originally built and operated by the church, with the purpose of performing plays in the service and for the edification of the congregation. In the early days, religious plays were an important part of church services, particularly for Catholics, who would have plays performed before each Mass. These plays were often based on religious characters and events, or they were adaptations of Biblical stories.

After trading, he has  16 broken arm rest/new chairs (16 new chairs - (16/16 (broken arm rests) times  66 (total chairs))\n\n#### The Deets...\nLet's start by explaining what we're given in more detail. This will help us break down what is going on and determine what we need to know.\n\n* Dr. Batch has 64 chains, 22% which have broken arm rests.\n* Dr. Banks swaps in 16 chains (from the 64 total) in return for 66 new chairs.\n* The chairs have broken arm rests, so he gets 66 new chains with broken armrests instead. \n* The value of all chairs now = 66 new chiains with broken armrests + (16 new chair - (16/22 (chairs without arm rests) times 66 (chairs))\n\nTherefore, his total number of chairs is = 16 (new chairs) - 22 (number of broken arm rests new chairs) = 66 new chair with broken arm rests + 16 broken arm rests new chair.\n\n### Task\nIn a city there is a group of n homes arranged in a ring with an extra space.

{"text": "> The answer that I choose would be B: accidents. I think this answer is the most accurate and most realistic as there are many reasons why one's car would be towed such as the car is parked on a street during a street fair. If one's car was parked during a street fair, there are usually notices on the ground or posted on the street pole next to the ticket you get to remind one to move their car once the event ends as it is blocking the view of other customers who want to walk down the line and see everything that the shop has to offer. Another reason would be that the car's parking time is expired and was not moved back to the parking space after the time limit. It was probably because the driver forgot or forgot to get the car back to its parking spot before the time limit is reached. I feel this answer is the answer that makes the most sense among the others as all of the others seem too extreme and in this case it wouldn't be fair enough for a car to be towed, unless the car's parker was a chronic forgetter and kept on leaving his/her car parked in the same place, causing the car to be towed numerous times, and the only solution now is to get a new car because you can't even count on your old one now anymore.\n\n### Input:[The shadows get 1543 inches at 7:30.] Which time is that?\n\n### Response:[7:30]\n\n### Inputs:[Sunrise at 6:00.

{"text": "#### D: 04-23-2013\n> There are 8 choices for this question.\n\n## Solution\nIn order to accomplish the tasks, we must create a series of if, while, and for elseif structures.\n\nWith the first task, the question asks us to add our numbers together and subtract the difference and multiply by 5. So, we create a while loop to iterate through the numbers until there are no more subtraction operations. Inside of the while loop we create a variable \"total\", then append to it for each loop iteration. Since we need a break condition once we hit 90, we use \"break\".\n\nAfter running this, I get 80 but the instructions said to subtract the numbers and get 90 as the result, thus, something else is probably wrong with my input.\n\nAfter some thinking the while loop can iterate through the numbers without doing anything else. So, I had to rethink my while loop. \nAfter some time I get 80 in response to the original instruction even though the result should have been 90. I did some research and found that I used variables \"result\" and \"target\" instead of \"sum\" and \"total\" respectively. Once I changed those to match I was able to arrive at my 90 expected result and was told to write a program to show me that sum and target were 1 less than each other.\n\nWith the second task, the instructions are pretty self explaneatory except for the subtraction operation which the statement says is not needed since the operations prior to and after are. So, I first create a variable to store the result and then in the if statement where the comparison between the number of Doebrman puppies and Schnauzers occurs I create a result variable to create. I then set it to a variable value of one less than the answer we expect in order for us to perform the subtraction.\n\nWith the rest of the task, I was required to modify the for statement which I think is necessary since it is not explicitly stated in the instructions. I simply put the statements inside the for statement and not inside of the if statement. I thought if I put it inside of the statement it would create an infinite loop because there would never be a time to check if the value of if statement \"a\" met the statement.\n\nWith my above modification for statement,", "answer": "D: parking garage"}

{"text": "Answer A: Aquarium\n\n#### Why?\nSince the shark is probably a large predator, such as a Tiger Shark, a Great White, Lemon Shark, or maybe even a Hammerhead, he's looking to eat. This likely means that he is the big fish in the pond and the smaller creatures are prey. In other words, the shark is looking to feed and will probably be found in a location where he can find prey.\n\n#### How do you know?\nBy the question's description of the shark, we can clearly see that the shark is aggressive enough to take on the other predators in the aquarium.\n\n### Inputs: I live in the south-east. If  I go west, I'm going towards the west coast. If  I go north, I'm going toward the coast in the north.\n\n### Response\n\nAnswer D:  Pacific Ocean\n\n#### Why? \nBased on the question, we can assume that the direction of travel is only relative to the person and that if someone were to be looking down from the clouds, or even, heaven's no! The stars, they would see a line coming from where the person started, through the destination. This would indicate movement north east. By using this method, the only possible answer is D, since the Pacific Ocean is always moving north east from anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere.\n#### How Do you know? \nBy knowing that the question does not assume a north-south alignment, we could eliminate all of the other possible directions based on the question.\n \n### Input:  The speed of sound is about 787 miles per hour.

Choices:   \n> A: Write a poem about how you feel\n> B: Write a blog\n> C: Give money to a charity\n> D: Protest publicly against a cause\n> E: Call to action to everyone in your network\n\n### A is a good example of action because it requires direct engagement and focus on the problem you are trying to solve. For example you might write a poem about how you personally feel about the current culture surrounding this issue.\n\n### B is also action. It may not require as much personal direct engagement, but it still takes the person behind it to share the thoughts on the issue they feel strongly about. For example this could be done through a blog.\n\n### C is an example of direct monetary action. The donation of money is one of the oldest, most respected forms of action in our society. This action does not require personal engagement, and does not require a public statement through an act of protest. Instead through a direct donation, you are directly supporting a cause.\n\n### D is an example of action. It is the form of action most historically seen as the only effective way of impacting a society through positive action. Protesting is, by definition, active, and takes an effort to be effective.\n\n### E is perhaps the worst choice, in the question it is suggested that an action taken by someone who is already connected to others online, or through a digital network could lead to a more change.

How many pieces of paper were needed for the pencil-users if there had to be at least one-third blue and at least one-fourth green?\n\n### Solution C\n\nSuppose the number of attendees at the conference is `a`, the number of people who took their notes on yellow paper is `b`, and the number who took their notes on green paper is `c`. Then, the number of pieces of paper used is calculated by:\n\n```\n    b * (1 + 3 / 4) + c * (4 / 4) = (a 5) / (a - 1) * (4 / 5) * ((b + c) - 1)\n```\n\nSince `a` is >= 15, this expression reduces to\n\n```\n    (a) * 4 / 5 * (b + c)  = ((a - 1) 4) * 5 * ((b + c)/(b + c - 1)\n\n    (a) 40 / 5 * ((b * 4 + c) 4)\n\n    (5a - 20) 40 * 4 = 200\n\n    (10a - 80) 400\n\n    a * b\n\n    a\n\n```\n\nIf one-third of", "answer": "D: theater"}

If the value of 'percent' is larger than the value of the 'vali', then you'll get a divide-by-zero error, and you will need to cover your bases and either round to the nearest one, give no output, or check the value of the percentage before you divide by 'vali' and make sure it's less than 1 before dividing.

What is this person's height at 1 hour, 10 minutes, and 15 seconds after noon?\n\nAnswer : 370 feet and 37 seconds\n\n### Demosration:\nAns = ( (24 *2) * ( 1.00 * 60 )  +  ( 24 * 1 ) *  ( 1.01 * 60 )   ) - ( 24 * ( 1.3 * 60 ) ) \n= 13.04*100\n= 1304.00\n\n### Explanation :\nAs each second person increases as 1/10 of the total height but it's base time is 1 feet, then each second it will increase as 1/17 feet in each second but their base time is 7 second, thus by 10 sec person will increase as 1*7 that means an increase of 7 feet, thus 10th second of the increase =7.\n\nNext a person is 22 feet long, but every 1.3 seconds it increases, thus after 5 seconds it is 22+5=27. It's 5th second of increment = (22*1*5)/360 seconds = 1/9 or 1/360\n\nThus after 5 min = (15*1/360)/360=15/360th of a seconds\n\nNext 10 minutes = ( 15/ 360)*10 = 15*1/60/360th/360  i.e the person 22-feet would be increased as  15*1/ 360*10=15/6000th of a foot\n\nNow 10 min +15/6", "answer": "A: contagious"}

{"text": "### Instructions: The word \"mint\" has been chosen as the new national currency. It replaces all coins currently in circulation.\n\n### Demo: The mint's production capacity is 1,000,000 pieces. The mint operates as a single unit, and each mint must complete all 1000 before getting a new assignment.  The mint makes a single minting machine. Each mint makes two coin types: silver quarters, and nickels.\n\nSilver quarters have a smaller surface area, and thus take less time to complete (2 seconds per minting machine).  Each silver quarter takes 16 seconds to make, and is assigned 1.16 silver quarters per minting machine.\n\nEach nickel takes 24 seconds to make and is assigned 1 nickel per minting machine.  The remaining silver quarters per mint are assigned by the time it takes for a single minting machine to make the remaining quarters. \n\nAll coins remain in circulation (each minting machine may make 1000 times 24 or 24,000 coins per minting).  After 50 minting hours, half of the minting machines are removed from production, and the minting process starts over where it left off on these removed machines. \n\nThe minting process completes 30 minted coins per hour for each minting machine.  If one mint produces 25,000 quarters and 25,050 nickels at the same time, the remaining quarters are minted after 19 minting hours have elapsed, and the minting machine's stop. \n\nIn 26 minting hours, two minting machines produce their first minting. The remaining minting machines start producing both coins within the same 26 minting hour time scale that the two new minting machines start producing their minted coin.\n\nThere are two options for each mint at any moment: mint either coins, or stop and wait until the next minting cycle starts.  However, if enough coins are minted to replace the production needs previously produced (e.g., the minting machine for 1000 quarters was needed and they finished their minting; so those mintings are not to be done", "answer": "C: music room"}

It was being chased by nine of the firefighters.\n\nA.  How many firefighters can run at you if you outrun three of them?\nB.  How many firetrucks would you have to avoid in order to beat ten dogs?\n\n### B Response\nIn both situations, the answer has to do with the difference in running speed.\n\nif the faster dog chases, the faster he would catch you. If you could maintain the same speed as the other dog you would be running the same as the other dogs.\n\nin this situation if the faster dog ran the other nine firefighters would not catch you. It is the last firefighter that catches the dog. When the fast dog chases you, you would have to travel 12 feet farther.\n\nThis equates to 0.0209 yards. This is the difference in the speeds of the dogs.\n\nSo the faster dog would catch you after 12 feet.\n\nTo compare the firefighters, we compare the change in speeds to the change in yards.\n\nThe first answer is for a slower dog (9.8yards/minute) chasing you for 13 minutes.\n\nI am now going to consider that you ran as fast (fastest is 21.9)\n\nYour dog would be faster than 1 firefighter (21.9y/min-9x9.8y/min= 12y/min) but would be slower than 2 (15.9y/min)\n\nThe total number of firefighters that would have to catch you would be N*0.632/0.1\nThe number of firefighers it takes is 9.36\n\nAs a last question the second answer should", "answer": "C: college"}

What is the minimum number of cars that the company can produce so that the minimum cost you can pay for is $1,003,000 and the maximum cost is $1,030,000?\n\n### Response(Note: please consider the following information: There are 3 other people that ask for a car. Therefore, only 9 cars would be produced over 2000(2k) days. After 1000(1k) days, the price would be at $1,004,000. Also, it would take 9*2k=$18,000 to produce all 9 cars. For a car to be produced in 1k days, it would cost $1,001,000. The price will begin at $1,050,000 and then drop to $700k after 2k days. A different group will ask for car so 9 cars would be the max.

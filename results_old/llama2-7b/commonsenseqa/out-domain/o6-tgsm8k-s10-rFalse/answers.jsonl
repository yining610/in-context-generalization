The cost of extra fuel went up by 25% in November. If the plane flies to 5 different airports, calculate the total cost. The cost of the plane is approximately $30/hour with a 3 hour minimum cost, which equates to $863 for flight.  The plane can travel without extra fuel for 267 Miles from Seattle to Honolulu and for 443 Miles to Sydney.  To calculate the extra fuel required, we need to multiply the shortest distance by 25% and get additional fuel requirements.

In order to do this I needed to know 1) how long he lifts weights each day,  so I used 1/3 (the proportion) and subtracted 1 to find John spent 45 minutes each day lifting weight (since each day consists of a warming up and cardio workout along with lifting weight). I know that means every week he spent 3 * 45 = 135 minutes. In order to get how many hours that is each week, I converted minutes into hours.\n### Input:Kyle and Jenna love babysitting for free and would always respond to an invitation if there was any possibility.  At a birthday party, every kid was available to babysit for at least 1/3 of the event. The party ended late at night for the kids to head to bed.  How many of the kids could sleep over?\n\n### Response\n\nI decided that \u201ck\u201d is the variable name for the amount of kids that can babysit and \u201ct\u201d is the total time for the party.\n\nFirst I decided that k = (t-1)/3 or k is the amount of kid that can babysits for free but that means that t must be a multiple of 3 and the only one that fits is 3. If we use the 3 in the denominator and solve for k, then k =1/t = (3/3)\n\nNext I subtract 1 from the equation then I multiply by the number of kids that came to the party as a denominator to be a multiple of 1 and then I add it to the next time the party ends. From there i solve for the amount of k that would be able to stay for the party.\n```\nK = 1/3 -1\n\nK = 1 (1-3 = -2 and 3 is a multiple)\n\nK = 5", "answer": "C: complications"}

Your program should ask for the data and evaluate the statement in the same order and structure as the statements are given in the problem.\n\nNote the following:\n\n1. If your program asks the user to input a value, the value must be an integer. If it asks for a phrase, the string needs to be enclosed in quotation marks.\n2. You can use any logical operators (AND, OR, NOT). If a statement has more than one question mark, any operator may be used with brackets: (AND, OR, NOT); OR, you may use operators inside a question mark: \"Are you alive?\".\n3. If your program asks for any string, it must be enclosed in double quotation marks (\"). The user must type the complete answer exactly as it is asked in the problem (for example, the exact question followed by the exact answer with brackets around the answer).\n4. The values given to your program must have the same range as in the given problem. For example, if the given problem says \u201cIf x is a string\u201d in the first statement, the string should be one word in lowercase or should not include any special character. If the second statement is \u201cIf x is double digit\u201d, the only integer that would meet this requirement is 0. If 0 is given as the answer the program should say, \u201cThis is right.\u201d.\n5. If the given range for variables in the question covers any type of non zero integer, the program must check for the type of number first. If the number is not a non-zero integer, it will not meet the range. The program should ask the user to check and re-enter only an appropriate answer.\n6. If the question statement has any data not explicitly given in the instruction, the program should ask the user first to input the values and then evaluate the statement.\n\n### Example:\n\nInstruction: Answer the following multiple choice question:\nFive apples or eight pears.

{"text": "### Solution\nIn order to figure out where to put the cloths there are factors to consider.  Where the closet is located is important because you have to take into account what room the cloths are currently in.  If the cloths are currently on the space heater then it is important you consider that space since the space heater is the only heated area to consider in the house.  The other cloths are located in the kitchen and bedrooms.  When determining if the bedrooms will need anything you have to consider that the space heater keeps those warm.  One thing that can be considered is that the closet is warm so the bedroom closets can remain full as well but that option is not ideal since that means that some of the cloths need to remain warm while all other cloths are cold.\n\nThe closet that needs the most cloths is the linen closet since that room is cold and it is warm during the day.  The second closet that needs a lot of cloths is in the bedroom since each person needs a few sheets and there are six people using the room.\n\nWith that in mind if the choices are: A: linen closets B: kitchen C: Bedrooms D: fabric store E Space heater the best choice would be to keep the linen closet warm.

If the players scored the same number of goals and the overall number of goals scored in league games is 350, what's the number of goals scored by each player, to two decimal places?\n\n### Response 2:\nIt's obvious that you can't do a match with more than two people and you always have exactly the half in each team. That being said, the 20 % of the goals are just 50 goals (1/4), those that one player scores more goals than his opponent, we should not subtract 1 goal to the team that one player scores less, because that 1 goal could also be from a different player (these players play their matches as well). We just need to double each one those 50 goals (since now both players score 50 goals) and we got the 20 % solution to match with the rest of the question. If the player scores 28 goals then we should just double 50 (28 x 2). Then we have 50 x 2 = 100, which means that each other of them scores 50 goals. That means one player scores the same number of goals than the one team scores, as well as the other.\n\n### A: If a person wanted to workout, but was too cold, she would decide\nto _____.\n\n### B: If a person wanted her hair to be shiny and\nsmooth, she would brush it with _____.", "answer": "A: relax"}

If there are 10 random draws done from this list what is the probability of picking one item that he likes, and another item that he likes as well?\n\n### Response\nThe probability of picking one thing that he likes is [($15$)/($100$)] X [($100$)/($10$)] or [($15$/100)][($100$/10)] = [($1.5$/10)][($1.0$/1)] = 1.5/100 = 0.015, which is the same as [($1.0$/(10.0$/5))] =  0.2/5 = 0.04.\nThe probability of pick a second item that he likes is the same as the probability of picking a first item that he likes. This is because each pick is a random draw, and the random draws are independent.\nTherefore, the probability of picking both is [($1$/($1.0$ (1.5/5))] or [($1.0/(1.5$/5))] = 1.0/0.3 = 3.335/5 or 0.0666/5 = 0113/5.

So she will invest $8 and make a profit of $2.\n\n### The first method:   She invests $3. She gets a profit of $1 and saves $2. But she makes a profit of $4. So she invests $4. She makes a profit of $2 and saves $2. And, of course she gets a profit of $4, so she invests all her money and she saves $2, she makes a profit of 16$.\n\n### Second Method: So if she gets a profit of 1, she invests $2. So she gets a profit of $.50, a profit of $.75, and a profit of $1.50.\n\n### Deduction: After the first method, you can deduce that she invested $3 as she only saved half. She only invested $1.5.\n\n### How much she invested in her business so she did make a profit by saving:\n\n### First Method: You can say that each time she invested $5, she got a profit of $62.5\n\n### Second method: If she did it in the same way as the first method, she invested $3 and made a profit of $0.75.

These caused only 18 deaths.The other causes of 696 deaths are due to operator error. A driver on a train had an argument with his passenger, causing him to not operate it responsibly. He did not reduce speed, which led his passenger to fall out. The other passenger on the train was also too fast, causing a collision with a baggage train. Another death resulted from a signal that was not on in the railroad. A passenger thought everything is fine until the last minute he was hit by the train. The driver was operating 3 trains during the day, despite rules of 2 trains per railroad operator. Finally, the most deaths are caused by the careless maintenance of the train. A worker did not check properly and forgot to inspect a defective part. 632 deaths due to operator error is 80% of all death by train accidents in 2013.

{"text": "I cant find a level in my own house!! But if I go to the  carpenters shop at a local store they should have one.\n\n### Input\nThe number of goals scored in his first 25 games this season accounts for 16% of goals scored by your favorite player last season. How many goals scored this season does he need to add up to his last season\u2019s goal number?\n\n### Response\nMy Favorite player,  LeBron  James, has 25 games this year and played 75 last  year.. The percent was 16 so, I need 16 points. If I take his current season with him still playing and take a quarter of those points it would be 20 points or 2 points a game, to make up for the rest of the regular season with the same percentage as last year. So I would need to get 16 points per season and each quarter he needed to add 2 points per game. He is averaging a 10 points per game so I should have to increase his average of 2 points per game to make up the 20 points that he will need, during his remaining 12.  His current average is 25 points, so I would need to increase his current average to 14, to meet my needs for the rest of the season at the same percentage as last season. With a little math I know that with a 2 point a game increase he will make up for the remainder of the season and his  percentage of the game will remain the same.\n\n### Question:\nJohns has $21 and wants to buy some snacks.

There were times he spoke very sarcastically and did some actions and comments that were not thought to be well received as he did them. For that, I was surprised my friend, Shane, was invited to the memorial at all.\n\nI wanted to share what went on because of my own interest in what went on. I want to take a lesson away from what happened. That lesson is this: when I go to someone else's service, I will remember Shane's experience. I will keep in mind how much my actions meant to those I interacted with. I will try to ensure my actions are thoughtful and respectful, and I'll be sure to not put humor or jest over things that are more somber or more serious.\n\n### Input (with context):There is a person with 800 calories available to eat the entire day.

Try this:If Johnny lost a key for a moment and wants to find it when he opens the cabinet, he must check each drawer in the first three units.  If an object has not been found after the three units, he must continue to check the remaining drawers in the cabinets until he finds the object.  The key is inside the cabinet until Johnny looks for it.  He must go through a unit in the order of descending numbers, starting from 1.  On the other hand, if Johnny wants to find the key for a moment, open the drawer with the lower numbers if the higher numbers are in the drawers of the first three units.   For example, if the number of the cabinet is 12 and the number of the first drawer is 20, then the object must be found inside the drawer with number 20, because the number of the cabinet does not include 20 because the drawers of the cabinets are arranged in ascending order, and drawers of the cabin must be opened one by one.  Therefore, if the drawer with number (20) has the key, open the drawer of the next lower number. \n\n### Response\na.

If you read the question carefully you will notice that they refer to the object as \"This is a train\" in this and only in this sentence the object is specified with \"This\".\n\n### Justify your answer:\nAs previously stated, this is a train (because the objects that are specified with \"This\" in the question are objects which are a train like this one and none of the other objects are trains like this one) and that leaves only \"this is a jet plane\" as a valid response.

You notice a flock of black sheep in a field, and you assume them to be domestic sheep.\n\n### Response\n\n>  It is safe to assume that all domesticated sheep are black sheep. However, black sheep are not necessarily domesticated. One could find a flock of wild sheep, in which case all the sheep would be black.\n\n### Input-1\n\n### Instructio0n:You are eating dinner with three other people. They are all members of your society, and you would like to invite two of them to join your club. You can only include players who are on a team at the time of the game.\n\nYou can invite up to one team member each other person, so you can't invite them more than that many. There are a total of 4 players, so you can only invite one player from anyone else's team. If you were to invite the players of a team that was not on your team, then you would also end up inviting the other four people as well.\n\n### The most common strategy is to have the same person invite the same person. If you invite A to the club, then A will not invite B and C to the club.  If anyone else invites B to the club, then the next person who invites B will not invite anyone if they do not invite B.\n\n### You can only invite players who are on a different team.

So we use all 30 options and two people can still talk in turns while another two are controlling the scene. Finally, the others will use their mind to talk to each other.

For example, you can choose the most useful option for you when the time comes. The option you choose can have a direct or indirect impact on the situation at hand.

{"text": "C is the hardest to get out of without breaking, as it is typically a hard, see-through plastic.\n\n\n### Output: What is the hardest to access without breaking as a result of doing so?\n\nA is the hardest to break. With a piggy bank, the contents can only be accessed by removing a lid, and often one that does not open with just the use of a finger. Also, the inside of a piggy bank is often soft and easy to mould with one\u2019s hands. If broken open, a piggy bank will not cause great damage to the person breaking it. In addition, a piggy banks\u2019 contents rarely change, meaning that it is not likely to have contents that are particularly dangerous. The cash drawer is the second hardest to get out from. Typically, the drawer must be moved away from the counter, or turned in order to access the cash inside. The money could only be taken by simply opening a door and lifting the drawer up enough to gain access. With a drawer, the contents are highly likely to be valuable to the owner. With a box, the contents are also highly likely to be valuable and the box is also more likely to be heavy and well-built than a piggy bank. Opening the door to a box could potentially injure the owner, depending on how it opens and the way it is positioned. Opening a box can also be very difficult for a child, as many do not know where the lid is placed. Finally, a purse is the hardest to open without breaking. Purse owners will frequently put a lock on the purse, making it likely harder to access the contents inside the purse, while not necessarily harder to take the actual purse itself. The purse could also be locked shut with a button closure. With purse contents that include items like credit cards, money and make-up brushes, they are typically the hardest to open, as they could contain valuable and delicate items. However, the purse itself is often small enough to be broken open by even a small person, such as a child or teenager. The contents could also be damaged very easily if the purse is broken, as they will often fall out. Furthermore, purse content could potentially be very delicate items, such as perfumes or makeup brushes, that can easily be", "answer": "B: piggy bank"}

Examples:\n\n999 -> 0 (in both ways)\n555 -> 0 (in all ways, because all digits add up to an even number)\n757 -> 5 (In both ways. In the first way, 3 + 1 + 7 == 11, remainder 1.

If you think about it, everyone always watch football in stadiums that can move, even though at most they\u2019ve just moved a few inches from one place to another. So they are looking at something that can move, and is moving. They\u2019re just saying it\u2019s only the football stadium that\u2019s moving, and nothing else. Which is not true in our lives. In my experience, the people that are always watching a football stadium never move. It\u2019s all people watching football. People watch football because the stadium isn\u2019t moving. The same thing with a car show. People don\u2019t watch a car show because the cars aren\u2019t moving. They watch car shows because they can actually move around the cars.

At first, only some of its needs were met, namely water and food, before the government increased funding and was able to buy a cement box where the panda can rest. In 2009, the zoo also bought a heated room where the panda can hibernate and save a bit of energy. The following table contains two columns with data about the panda that you can use to answer the questions.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe data you are given is in columns B and C.\nColumns B and C tell you the number of days that the panda was in captivity and at what temperature it was kept, in other words, it is in columns B the year and it is in column C the temperature.\nTo answer the first question we want to know the number of days for every year in the past that the panda was kept below 19 degree Celsius.\nWhat we need to do is, for each year to get the row with the temperature for that year, divide column A by 2.15, then multiply by 365. From there, check column B to find the year, and for the temperature in column C (using your division and multiplication). Finally, make sure to add one to the output because the panda was in a human-created room. After doing that for every year, you can see that the number of days over 19 Celsius is always higher than the number of days under that temperature.\nIf you would like to check my answer in an interactive form, here is a link (click on the \"solution\" button to see my answer.

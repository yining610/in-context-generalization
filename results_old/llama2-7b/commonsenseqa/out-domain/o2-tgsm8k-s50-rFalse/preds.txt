In this case, “the difference in age” refers to Richard and Hurley’s difference in ages (i.e., Richard is 2 years older than Hurley) and “the combined age” refers to the ages of Richard and Hurley. By examining their ages 40 years later, we are analyzing a part of the family. <n><n>The correct answer to this problem is 128 because the sum of the ages is 128 (i.e., 14 + 28 for a combined age of 42).<n><n>### Answer: B<n><n>In our example, by “reading” you are taking information that you have seen, either through an optical telescope (e.g., microscope or telescope) or through an eyepage (which we call “telescopes” in our example).<n><n>The correct answer is “c” because the total number of books read by Pablo is 12 (i.e., if he checks out 150 pages, all these pages count as one book). <n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:No matter the background of the person, they should all be given what in applying for the job? Choices:  A: critical thinking B: congratulated C: equal opportunity D: compliments E: raffle tickets<n><n>### Response:		<n>**Conceptual answer** <n><n>* I agree that regardless of the race, income, gender, sexual orientation, age, physical ability, or religion, that we should offer everyone a fair and equal opportunity to apply for a job. Without an equal opportunity to apply for the job, we can't consider that person an equal opportunity employee and won't get a diverse workforce. Employers need this diversity within the workforce in order to thrive in this constantly changing work climate.<n><n>If a person applying is of African American descent and has a criminal conviction, they should still be considered for the position, because just because that person has a record does not make them an incapable employee. This person could be given a chance with the proper training. With the training from the employer, there is another chance that if the job is given to this person with a record, there would be fewer recidivism.<n><n>On the other hand, if you put one of the individuals into the position without any training and having already committed a crime, that could turn out to be a liability. If this person is hired, then there would be a chance that they would commit another crime and it would affect the whole work environment.<n><n>This would affect everyone who works with this person because they would be taking a risk in hiring this individual and there would be no safety or morale amongst the coworkers. It could possibly put that person in a situation that they could lose their job and could even bring on a lawsuit.<n><n>It is obvious that even if the person has been given the opportunity and accepted onto the job, they should learn how to live a crime-free life and be able to do whatever it takes to make sure that they stay afloat so they can have a decent way of life. If the person doesn’t take this opportunity at the time they should learn the consequences and to put things in perspective and know what they need to do to change their lives, but if they fail and things don’t work out that they would not have been given the opportunity to apply for the position. It would only make the situation worst.<n><n>**Programmatic answer:**<n>To implement fairness for applying to the job, I would use a program that would allow every applicant to submit their information and give them a status. It would have a color status to show whether they made it or were not selected for the job or had some

The wind is blowing at a constant 100 km/h from directly left of the plane perpendicular to the direction of travel. When the wind is blowing from the north, the pilot is following the same procedure (left turn, 90 degree turn, left turn), and is thus making a 30 degree turn toward the north. When the wind is coming from the south, he is following the same procedure, and is thus making a clockwise turn.<n>### Response :<n>If plane is following straight route and wind is blowing at constant 100 Km/h form directly left perpendicular to plane direction of travel and direction of wind is same as plane direction then it means north and plane is turning clockwise, if the wind is blowing south then plane is turning anticlockwise, so if wind is already blowing from north it can cross a turn even if left turn is done.<n><n>

The bank wants to make a $100,000 loan. They believe the borrower can only repay $ 40,000 a year for 20. If the repayment begins in one year, how much money will the bank lose if the borrower can repay the loan in less than 20 years?<n>2.	Given that the total amount of the loan was $ 500 million, how much of the loan is being repaid each year, if every year, only one million dollars is being returned on the principal?<n><n>\Response:<n>Asker: The bank wants to make a  $100, 000 loan.  The loan payment that can be repaid per year is $ 40, 00 per year.  The interest rate per year for borrowing a loan is 6%  In 12 years,  the borrowing will be zero and the loan will never be paid back.   Let us write I(t) = $ 6t, where t is the number of year, which means $6 per year.  The loan will never be paid off over 20 years. <n><n>Borrowing: Given that the total amount of loan is $ 500, 0 million and the loan payment every year is one million dollars repaid on the principle (P).In 10 years,  the loan is still due ( 500,00 million – 100, <n>000 million). So in 10 years,   the borrowed amount is $500,0 000 and the interest rate every year is 6%.  The loan is still due.  In 12 year,  the borrowing amount is gone but the loan is still due that means there is no outgoing amount but the principle is still due.<n><n>Let I(t) =$6t  and P

The company has been getting poorer discounts from its suppliers recently and thinks it could profit more in the future if they cut their inventory levels. To reach that goal, the company should increase its production of all three products, except for product B. What should the company do? The answer is B Cut production of product A and product B<n><n>Output: Cut Production of Product A<n>The company made a $2475 Profit last month but in order to increase efficiency they should cut the production of Product A and Product B, especially the product with the biggest markup.<n><n>### Output Cut Production of Product B<n>Answers D<n>Output If product A and product B are your best selling products and product A has a bigger markup than product B, cutting its production is not a very good idea because cutting product B is the best in terms of increasing your profit.<n>

One day, after class, Jake's teacher invited him out to the playground. The teacher brought a bowl of marshmallows and asked Jake if he could eat only 10 marshmallows without any of his fingers touching the other marshmallows. Jake nodded and the teacher set the marshmallows 7 inches away from his hand. “Jake, before you eat any marshmallows, how much time do you need to come up with a strategy for eating the marshmallos?” the teacher asked. Jake paused for a moment, looked down at the marshmalllows, and then looked up and smiled. “I’ve got it! I’m just going to push all 10 to the side and eat just the first one.”<n>```<n>Jake’s answer was incorrect. If Jake pushed 7 marshmallows away and ate the first one, he was still able to touch another marshmallow. Jake would have been able to eat all 10 marshmalows with his strategy.<n>```<n>Jake was a victim of a common mathematical fallacy known as the paradox of choice. People often think about all of their available options, even when they can't actually use all their options, or even all the options that they are thinking about. Sometimes the best answer is the one that

We can also see that soft drink also made with water since soft drink is a category of drink or drinks that contains carbonated water (soda water) as its main base ingredient. Soft drink can also contain sweetener like sugar while mountain dew is more concentrated than soft drink. Mountain dew is like soft drink because they both contain carbonated water, but mountain dew is more popular because when used mountain dew makes us happy while soft drink is just used to quench our thirst, another option is whirlpool, since is also a water drink and uses water or carbonated water as its main base ingrede nt.<n>Finally, it doesn't matter if we're talking about coffee cup or sweet coffee, both use water or water is one of its ingredient making it important. Since both are drinks and when a person is done with their work or other activity, the most common thing first thing that is done is having a cup of coffee, coffee cup is the name of the cup itself. So when a person drinks it he can feel so relaxed because it will make him/her sleepy.<n><n>### Answer<n><n>### What can be modified<n>* I didn't follow the instructions very well<n><n>### What I can improve in the future

In fact, we often compare ourselves to others and feel we never quite measure up. But the truth is we are the only ones in the world who can really tell ourselves what our strengths are.<n><n>First, we have to be open about what we value. To do this, we have to know what we believe about ourselves. Many people have a lot of self-doubt, which can make focusing on success and what we want to accomplish very difficult. By developing a clear idea of what we value, it is easier to understand the unique contributions we can make to our organization.<n><n>When we have knowledge about what we value, we can then recognize what we contribute. If we truly know our values, we can easily determine what we bring to the workplace.<n><n>It goes without saying that we don’t often take stock of these value-driven qualities because we are too busy rushing to our next meeting or worrying about all the unfinished work on our desk.<n><n>Even though many of us feel inadequate in many areas of performance, there are specific value-driven qual-ities that we all have – skills we may take for granted because they are so important that we almost can’t see our world without them.<n>

Choices:  A: obtaining information B: exchange of ideas C: sharing information D: conversation E: gathhering of information<n><n>### Response:		<n>It seems it was B, exchange of ideas. The session is the sharing of information using a particular means of communication that are face-to-face, either directly or through the use of other media technologies (such as phones and the Internet). We call it the traditional conference because it focuses mainly on the exchange of information between people.<n><n>### Notes: <n>The brainstorming session is a technique for helping to generate as many ideas relating to a specific topic as possible. It is the most effective when every person involved has a similar skill level and experience in the subject matter and in group brainstorming. There may be a person in the group who has a more extensive knowledge on the topic or has access to more data or resources but everyone should have the same experience in brainstorming. Brainstorming is a flexible and easy-to-use tool that provides an uninhibited, spontaneous and positive group environment, where every person can share and contribute their ideas. The leader of the discussion is not allowed to criticise or stop anyone. The leader of the brainstorming is expected to record all ideas, whether they are positive or negative and evaluate every new idea. But there is a good reason to give negative idea a close look. Sometimes it is negative or even contrary to the brainstorming goals. But the most valuable ideas may be the negative or counter-productive. If a negative solution seems like it can help in some way, then it needs to be evaluated.<n><n><n>### Additional notes:<n>You can look at the Brainstorming Wikipedia's page for more information about the topic.<n><n>### Submit your response in the form of a comment below.<n>### Upload files

Choices:  A: stress B: nervousness C: smile D: being bored E: making new friends<n><n>### Response:		D<n>I am going to choose D because I think that being self-centered makes you feel nervous about meeting new people because maybe you have a bad reputation and you just want to do everything right and not make the wrong moves because if you act stressed people might judge you and ask what wrong what did you do and that will just make things worse. You can’t make up new friends because everyone already thinks you’re a jerk so you won’t say hi when someone looks at you and you will just stand there. So I would choose option D.

There are shops around me, however, I did not see the store I planned to enter.  I arrived at a stop lights corner and noticed a man sitting there.  I knew this was a man I often saw walking around.  I have not seen that man in days so, I called to him with the expectation that he would follow me to the store.  He did not follow me, and I realized after taking my second left turn, that he had been dead, laid out at the corner with a sign saying 'will work for food'.  I went inside the store and bought $5 worth of food for him.  After picking up some items, I went to go check on the dead man.  I walked by a bus stop and noticed a girl eating her fruit.  She must have seen me looking at the dead man and she asked what I was looking at.  I explained the problem and she said she would get the dead man some food, but she only had $2 in her coin purse.  She then offered me a $1 for my food and gave me a dollar sign with one dollar in the middle.  I told her I had 2 items to purchase and the total was going to exceed $1. She told me that she would be returning later to take me to a casino.  I was not expecting that, but I decided to take her up on her offer.  I took a $2 bill out of my coin purse and added it to her hand full of change.  She told me they made a nice pair and she held me by the hand and led me to the casino.  We walked in and saw a table with a man dressed up as a gambler.  I asked what we could do and he told me anything.<n><n>### Output:<n>I would like to know whether it was reasonable what the girl did for me.<n><n>### Analysis:<n><n>#### <n>#### Answer:<n><n>Answer:  Not a good idea, because her actions could potentially hurt me.<n><n>#### Reason:<n>Her actions hurt me when I thought the man was alive and

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:How often are secular parties held? Choices:  A: short term B: crowd C: unpredictable D: frequent E: eternal<n><n>### Response:		Frequent<n><n>### Reasoning:The secular parties should be held frequently since it is an unpredictable party. The word eternal seems like an eternal party would be the one to hold the most parties. Since there are parties for eternity, they would be frequent. It's hard to answer why the secular party is held, since they do not seem to hold too many parties. In that case, I would take frequent since it is more logical.<n><n>### Input<n>What is the name of the person standing next to the blonde? Choices: A: Mandy B: Melanie C: Melissa D: Diane E: Denise<n><n>### Response<n>Mandy<n><n>### Reasons:<n>In the picture of the blonde there is someone standing next to her. Who is it? It is named Amy, but I will just answer the question. Since there is Mandy and I can see that it says Mandy standing right next to the blonde, Mandy must be standing next to the blond. There are no one who have this name other than Mandy. As the answer Mandy gives is the one that has the same name as the one standing next to the blont and that is how I pick one.<n><n>### Note:<n>There is something wrong with the answer I gave. The picture of the blonde is not of the Mandy I know. <n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20. If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Answer: 12<n><n>### Input:The skin was cut while chopping onions, where was this skin likely cut? Choices:  A: good health B: finger C: meat D: body E: own family<n><n>### Response:		Choices -  D. Body<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Richard said it was a cut that happened to his own body, so it was cut on his body. Since Hurley is talking about cuts that only affect them, the cut must be on his body. Also, Richard is 16 and Hurley is 52, so the combined ages are at least 78 years. So, when they combined ages of 40 years from the original question, their combined ages must be 78-20 because it’s 40 years from when they’re 14. So the solution is 128 - 20 = 108, and Hurley is 156, so the combined ages must be somewhere 156 + 20 = 78-2 = 76. So the combined ages are 128 and since Richard was 16 (2 added to 150-52= 98-2=76) so the combined ages are 76 and 16, so I know 128=76+98, so I know 76=98+20-16, so since Pablo is 52, if I add 20 to both sides of the equation, I get 52 + 20 =172, so Pablo read 12 books.<n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover.

Choices:  A: home B: hardware store C: home D: hot room E: office<n><n>### Response:		<n>For the first problem, we can use the modulo function to find the difference, in this way `xmody` means that the result is x modulo y.<n>For the second problem, we have to read the question carefully and look for more clues to understand what is being asked for. We know that the answer is 12 because we can read:<n>```<n>Every book has 150 pages<n>Every cent equals 1 page<n>```<n>We can then write the following: <n>```<n>mothers amount = every book<n>candy amount = every page<n>```<n>We know the amount of money is at least the amount of candy, because Pablo cannot spend more than the amount he has saved.<n>Since Pablo will do his math, he will buy the amount of candy for which he has enough money. Since he has enough money for 15*3 candy, his number of pages must be: `150/3 = 50`.<n>Since we know that it is in the `range (1.. 150)` and we have allotted 50 pages, the remaining 27 pages must be from books with a page number `25-50 = 100` and `24-50 = 6 pages`.<n>The remaining amount of candy must be the amount that remains within 15 cents.<n>The total amount of pages must be `50+100+6 = 166` which is divisible by 50 as there are 3 bundles of 50 pages. If one of these bundles has 150 books, the other one would have 100 and since `m` is divisible by 3 and `b` divisible by 5, `m = 3b` for them to divide it evenly.<n>Therefore, `2*3*100+100=12000`<n><n>12 is the only number that satisfies the requirements of the question.<n><n>

Choices:  A: interesting B: fun C: joyful or painful D: very important E: free<n><n>### Response:		<n>```<n>The most important aspect of learning is the learning environment and the content of the learning. If the learning environment is one where we are comfortable expressing our fears, doubts, weaknesses, etc., then we can feel safe to ask questions during class. This can lead to increased understanding of challenging concepts. The main problem with how we are educated in many countries is the standard of learning does not meet the needs of society's needs as it does not always build on student's interests which means the learning is not exciting enough and is the least preferred method of learning. Learning can also be made enjoyable through gamification. We can use games to encourage students to do their assignments, we can also create games to teach concepts as another way of learning. It would be great to have an environment that can change learning for you that supports the different learning types. I think that one can be able to pick one's preference to learning online or offline. One example of the type of learning platform that can do this is Udacity. It allows you to pick offline or online learning from their site. Udacity also allows you to select and learn at your preferred speed. When taking a course, one has to complete units at their learning speed that's why I'd prefer them to give you options for the speed of learning.<n>```<n><n>#### Output:<n>```<n>Output: <n>```<n>### Instruction The text below was written by someone else. Write a response that describes an experience from your own life where you faced this challenge.<n><n>Instead of being an open person who's ready to share and embrace new experiences, my learning is like a cocoon that I keep inside and no one but "Me" knows how large it is. I am not proud of it, I always feel like if I have a great opportunity, I let it get away because, fear of what other people might think. I've always been afraid of failure, I didn't want to end up being the nerd and the loner again in school. I have so many unfulfilled dreams, I hope they get fulfilled soon and I can be a better part of the world. I have made many friends but have always been afraid to show how I really am, I've always been scared they don't like me anymore.<n><n>### Comments and feedback from the other person<n><n>I like

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover.

Choices:  A: republican party B: old people's home C: office D: park E: high school or college<n><n>### Response:		C<n>### Explain:<n>The correct choice is "C" because the words "lived" and "with his children because" in the question, Lindy's kids are elderly. But why do we have to write "he lived with his children because" this is to show that he is not living with his children to be together but to be independent because of where he wanted to go.<n>### Instruction 2:<n>Write a response that appropriately answers the question.<n><n>##### Demonstrations:<n><n>Input: In the book, the heroine's name is "Lily." She likes to go to the park because she likes to listen to the birds sing and watch the water fall over the edge into the creek. When she gets home from the park, she makes cookies in the kitchen to eat. What does she make cookies with? Choices: A: Cappuccino B: Soup C: Honey D: Cheese<n><n>### Answer: <n>### D<n>### Explanation:<n>The correct one is d, because when she mentions about a girl she likes to listen the birds sing and watch water fall. Then it says to make sweet dish, such as cookies. And also the words she said "cookies" is in plural. And the word "cappuccino" is not common in our daily life. I think her main ingredient is sugar, milk, and flour.<n><n>#### Instructions 1:<n>Describe the process given.<n><n>### Process One:<n>An airplane was flying through the sky in a certain route.

After he pulled it the plane was in a better and safer position.<n>### Demonstatrion:<n>Before you start, make sure you draw some imaginary lines. Then make the left stick facing down and right stick facing up and put the top one down a little because you are on autopilot already. Then start the airplane moving right and up. Put the right and up stick down.<n>### Explanations:<n>#### Why the stearing up left stick was made into down<n>B

Choices:  A: utah B: south america C: new hampshire D: japan E: new mexico<n><n>### Response:		D: Japán.<n><n>### Description: <n><n>When Richard is 40, he will be 20 years older than Hurley (by that time Hurley will be 60). Then 100 - 20 = 80 = 10 Years, so that they are 40years older by that time together = (14 + 40) = 14 = 12 years old when he is 128.<n><n>In this question is not said how many pages is the page, only the cent the boy’s mom will pay per page, then he will read 80% and 60% per p. and if he reads the half of the pages the whole page is worth (100%) each, then divide all pages that he will read by two to get all the pages (56pages x 0.5 =28pages).<n><n>So $15 = (\frac22 x 28) =14pages \Rightarrow 14pages x $0.01 = $0.14.<n><n>So after read $0.15 x 40=$40 dollars and the rest $0.14 x 40 = 5.60 dollars, then he has to save $45.60 so the rest is $3. Then each of the two pages he will read will cost $0.14$, so to save $45$ he is going to read 4 pages<n><n><n>In that question we will take the first answer it is said the boy will save money to buy the candy, so he buys all that he needs to have a equal price to the total of the ones they read, so all pages x $\frac22$ will have the same price that the total of money that he is saving = $\frac22$ x $Page$ = Total of that money.<n><n>If he read $Page$ x 15$ =$ Page \times \frac43 (2 pages are equal to one cent) =TotalPrice.

Choices:  A: eyes B: biology laboratory C: shower stall D: old cheese E: decaying matter<n><n>### Response:		Answer: C<n><n>### Feedback:<n> 1. If the choice is B, the description states that fungus can grow on a biology lab. Fungus does not grow anywhere in the biology lab, it grows on things that are decaying, such as food. That is why it needs to be grown for consumption or in a dark space.<n> 1. If your answer were B, you would not receive credit because the description stated that fungus grows on things that are dead.<n> 1. This is an example of the difference between the task and the question, if your answer were C, you would receive credit if you used the answer choices as instructions and did not simply look at them and choose. The best way to solve this challenge is to not think about the question, but the data in the description. You must determine that the description states that the answer is E, and it asks for the place that the growth would be and then you must look at the choices to see if they include what you are looking for. However, you have to go out of your way to find the answer you are looking for by narrowing things down. You cannot make simple assumptions about the question. The answer will not be a simple guess.<n><n>### Input:"The last time I saw Chase he was wearing a plaid shirt. He didn’t have anything else to wear for the occasion.

{"text": "Rationale:This question has choices B and D, the options of which are mandate and optional. To further determine the correct answer as B, one can use the fact that the evacuation became mandated. If the evacuation has become mandatory, it means that people have been ordered to evacuate beforehand. By then, it would mean that the evacuation is no longer optional, which would be an option, but is mandated. Thus, the correct answer is option B, which is mandate, and option D, which is optional. Thus, since both options B and D are the correct answers, the answer to this question would be D, which is mandate.\n\nAnswer: D, Mandate\n\n### Input\n\n### Problem:\nThe evacuation became necessary, so what ate on the TV? Choice:\nA: advice B: mandate C:: soap oper D: elective E:: Optional \n\nResponse: (write your response here)\n\n#### B\nAnswer: B, Mandate\n\nRationale: The question requires the student to choose the necessary option (A) and the optional option (E), which, by definition, means that it can be omitted if the recipient so chooses. The question has the options B and D, which are the mandate and optional, respectively. To see what choice A and E entail, let us look at the synonyms of the words contained in each of the two options. If we look up elective in the dictionary, it is a choice that is subject to the decree of the person or entity to decide. Here, this means that the recipient is the one who chooses the option, so this option can be omitted if the person does not want to evacuate. If we look up mandate in the dictionary, it means an authoritative order or command. Here, this means it is an order that is subject to the recipient\u2019s obedience on the other hand, optional has been defined as the synonym of choice, and there is no difference between it and choice: the recipient is free to choose one option and not the other as long as he follows his own preference. So, the correct answer to this question is choice B, which is \u201cMandate\u201d and choice D, which is \u201cOptional\u201d.\n\n\n#### Answer:\n\nAns:=A choice that is subject to", "answer": "A: advisory"}

The standard deviation is defined as the arithmetic mean of the deviations from the mean. Therefore, the number of standard deviations is equal to the standard deviation / (average value)*2.3. Based upon the data in the question, 2.3 = 45/31*19989/45*2 is approximately equal to 59/31*10^9/45*10^2.\nThe number of standard days above average (as per the data) that it rains in New delhi in any given week would therefore be standard deviation / 3, or 2.3/3 = 0.769 or 76.9%. The number of days above average that New Delhi rains in a given week is therefore 76.9% of the week or roughly 77% of the week.\nBased on the data we have in the question, New Delhi only has a 2.6% chance of getting normal rainfall.", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

The intended purpose of small talk is to maintain interpersonal relationships or build relationships. Small talk is used to establish rapport or get to know people who are new to you. Small talk differs slightly from social talk in terms of the type of conversation that it is.

The average time to offload one cargo is 5-minutes.  A plane arrives every hour, and the plane may have up to 900 pounds of freight ready  to be unloaded. How many pounds of cargo can be unloaded after the hour of flight arrival?\n\n### Rationales:Since the cargo plane needs to be offloaded in an hour, there are only an hour\u2019s (60 minutes) worth of cargo to unload. We need to divide the 900 total pounds by the cargo time of 5 minutes to get the number of airplane cargo (that is ready to be unloaded) an airplane can have. \nDividing by the 5 minutes gives us 180 pounds of cargo per plane, and since we can have 60 total pounds of cargo per airplane in an hour, we can have 20 planes with 500 pounds of cargo (3000 pounds) of good in an hour.\n500/900 = <<500/9*90=180>>180 airplanes (cargoes) in each hour.\n3000/180 = <<3000/9*18=180>> 180 pounds\n#### 180\nAnswer:  180\n\n### Instructor:\n**Your task:** Write a response that begins", "answer": "D: small talk"}

{"text": "> B: drawer\n\n### Why?: \"drawer\" is the closest of the choices. The person who is looking for it might easily forget that they put it in a trunk, which means they'd have to find a trunk. They might not open their trunk very often, so a trunk seems like a longshot. And if you forgot you got something from the washing machine, you'd have another excuse to open it and put it in, but you could probably tell the difference between a shirt and pants if you looked inside of a washing machine drawer. So a drawer seems like the best answer here...\n\n### Rationales: A: trunk - Trunk seems the least likely since the person might not open their truck very often and might not remember opening it to get the clothing.\nB: drawer - \"drawer\" is a plausible answer since \"drawer\" is near most likely answers and is on the same line of thinking.\nC: suitcase - \"suitcase\" doesn't seem relevant to the question, and the question asks where clothing is found, not where is found in the whole apartment. Not relevant, and it's also not on the same line of thought.\nD: bookshelf - \"bookshelf\" could mean it was a book from the library or a library book that hasn't been returned. Not relevant, and still on another line of thought.\nE: washing machine - \"washing machine\" seems like a longshot since \"washing machine drawer\" isn't relevant at all, and it's on a different line of thinking.\n\n### Output:\nDrawers are the best answer. The person might not remember that they got their clothing from the wash, they might forget they have clothes in the trunk, and they might not remember opening the suitcase unless they have been specifically told to look there...", "answer": "A: trunk"}

How long does this take?\nChoice 1: The straight line.\n\nChoice 2: The longest path.\n\nChoice 3: A route that avoids tolls.\n\nChoice 4: A route through town.\n\nI would like to say that the question is incomplete in the sense that it doesn\u2019t include any variables such as distance or speed but I will continue with the answer and see if it will suffice.\nThe shortest route from A to B would have to be (A-B) and (B-A). From this equation we see that the two greatest determinants are the time that A is travelling to B and B is travel to A then the shortest possible route from A to B is the combination of those two times. \nSo, if the trip from A to B is A -> B then B -> A  we can say, the shortest route is: A -> B ->A which in shortest form is B -> A.  In other words if the distance to B would be the same distance as you make your way back from B, you have found the Shortest route.\n\nIn the Straight line route we can say that (A-B)+(B-A)=(A-B)\nBut since we were travelling straight line, we would have to travel back in the same straight line which means that you will be making a loop and since it is B -> A, and A is traveling to B, the journey to the airport would be longer if A is already traveling to B. A -> B is the shortest route from A -> B\nIn the Looongest path route, we would have to go back in the path and make a loop once again which means that the A-B path is B-A and B-A is A-B which also means that going the extra distance to the airport is what it takes to reach it. The shortest route from A-B -> A-B means that the shortest path is to return back in the same path. \n\nIn the route to avoid tolls case, tolls can only be avoided when travelling on long roads.

What's the best way to prevent the pass?\nA. Have the two opposing goalkeeper's run straight towards each other and attempt to tackle the ball as it's passed.\nB.

Have the pass made from near to the midway line, so that the opposition will have a greater distance to pass.\nD.

Have your midfield players back and shield the goalkeeper.\n\n#### \nInput: There are 34 states of the USA\nOutput: True\n\n#### \n\n### Solutions:\nB. Have a single player charge at one of the four defenders.\n\nF. The pass is taken from the midfield.\n\n### Justifications:\nIn a four-on-four scenario, at all times only three members of the four attacking players can be directly involved. Of these four, usually two are concentrating on the heads of the defenders, the other two are concentrating on shoulders. If two players are charged with tackling the same opponent, that player has been effectively stripped of contact support (support in making successful tackles). Therefore, both the pass and the tackling options are limited during the last minute of the match, leading to increased effectiveness.\n\nIf there were only two charging players, they would need to cover a greater distance to reach the intended target. Covering a greater distance decreases their chance of being successful with the tackle, leading to a less effective option.\n\nThis approach is much less costly than using the three midfield players to protect the goalkeeper from a long pass.

It takes a lot of time, dedication and self-discipline to obtain a new title. This is the reason why those who are unhappy with their salary should begin at the bottom of the ladder and work their way up if this is what they desire. They can do this by taking on a shift that they may not like, helping other members of their team, or even getting an additional education. No one is going to hand them a raise, and the one thing they can control is their own efforts.\n\nAs the manager of a fast food restaurant, you have noticed an unexpected surge in customer traffic. A lot of people have come to your restaurant in the past few weeks, and as you have been unable to provide them with what they wanted and how they wanted it, customer complaints have risen.

{"text": "B - go to school band to get bass clarinet\n\n### Rationales:\n\nB: Music stores often offer rental programs for instruments with a lower monthly rental fee as long as you're purchasing the instrument eventually, it is ideal to get the bass clarinet from a music store instead of some other place.\n\n### C - go to Orchestra to get bass clarinet:\n\nC: Orchestras usually host shows that are free for the public. They typically don't require that people be involved in an orchestra to attend and thus people attend their shows for fun with their friends regardless of whether there are any bass clarinets up for sale at their store. It has not been specified that one needs to own a bass clarinet in order to attend one of these shows.\n\n### A - go to orchestra:\n\nA: A is incorrect because they do not necessarily offer rental programs because not everyone is in need of a bass clarinet. People who show up to orchestra shows aren't interested in renting one. If you go to the opera house you may be able to find a bass clarinet being played somewhere, but that is it and you can't really get your own from there.\n\n### D - go to school band:\n\nD: People don't typically carry a bass clarinet with them when visiting a music school to get an instrument but they would do so for the school band where it is most likely to see someone on the bass clarinet playing or selling the instrument.\n\n### E - go home: \n\nE: Most likely, the clarinet is not in the home of the person or they won't know anyone who has one and therefore won't know where to buy one anyways.\n\n### Answer: B - go to the school band.", "answer": "C: music store"}

A: 0 B:13.2 C: 1.8 D: -2 E: 24.67\n\n### RESPONSE:(A)\n\n### Rationales:- The volume of liquid contained by the cup is 10000ml. Each liter of water at room temp has a mass of 0.0001 kg. You can approximate these values as: The cup's volume is V ~ 1000 L. The volume's mass is M ~ 0.1kg.

How many new cars are being purchased in your state now?\nRationales\nIn 2001, 10.2 million Americans were buying new cars every month, as compared to 12.35 million today.  It took 12.3 million/10.2 million = <<12.3/10.2=1.20427>>1.204 times as long to make all the new cars today as it did in 2001.\nSo right now, 10.1 million + 1.2 times 9.1 million= <<11.2/10.1+1/9.1>>1.206*10.1*9.1== >>120.6* *101*>>1206*116 new cars are being purchased every month.\n#### 120\nAnswer: 120\n\nInput: You go to a store and buy only the products you see on sale.  But you end up buying more than your intended purchase because of the sale.  How much more do you end up paying than if the items were priced at their regular price?\nRationales The difference between how much you save and how much you\u2019re spending is equal to the amount you would have saved if the items had been priced at a higher price if you did not have a sale.\nSo if you buy more than what you intended to buy, you spend on average $X which is not $0 (since you spent some amount of money).\nThat means the difference in your average savings from the sale with you buying whatever you intended to will be $X-0= $ >>X-0=XY>>X\nX is the difference between the quantity you wanted to buy and the quantity you actually bought during the sale period.\nSo $X = >>4/3*X=4/3*10>>4/3*1*$10=11.7$,\nwhich", "answer": "B: hear sounds"}

How much did he drive in total?\nRationales:# The answer to the question is the total distance he drove overall. If we add the distances of his trips above, We get 40+45 = <<40+45=85>>85 miles overall.\n\nAnswer: 85\n\nInput: At a party there were 35 guests and 6 servers, who served only 6 guests each, with an average of 15 minutes each. How long was the party?\nRationales 1: We subtract all the servers serving guests, meaning 6 guests x 15 minutes = -90 minutes. Minus 90 means the total is +90.\n2: The answer to the question, if it were true, would be the time it took the servers to serve the 6 guests they were assigned. If it took 15 minutes, the answer would be 6*15 or 90.\n3: If there was no wait at all, the servants could serve 35 guests over 15 minutes each, or an average of 2 minutes per person. This means we had to subtract an additional 35 * 2 = <- 35*2=60>>6 minutes, which negates itself, therefore making 60 minutes.\n# The answer to the question would be the time it was taking the servers to prepare for the guests, and therefore have nothing to do with the guests.

{"text": "Incorrect\n\n### Demostration: A: heart attack\n\n### Rationale: Jogging all day could cause heart attacks because the continuous exercise will increase the heart rate and oxygen consumption. So a jogger may fatigue and may not be able to complete the exercise. But since jogging is done outdoors it may contribute to shortness of breath and dehydration. So the correct answer is c. Exhaustion.\n\n### Response 2: The correct answer is exhaustion.\n\n* A: Heart attacks may occur when there's a blockage in the coronary-arteries as a result of plaques. A plaque builds up within the inner part of the artery making blood flow less. Continuous exercise could cause a plaque to rupture that may cause a blood clot thus resulting to heart attack.\n* B: The soles of your feet will be exposed to the different weather elements so they'd become dry and will cause blisters. And when they'd crack it's really a cause of concern because it could lead to an infection.\n* C: Blisters.\n* D: If the exercise is really that strenuous then a person's breathing might be fast and deep. Too much exhaustion can contribute to the person gasping or even panting. But if a person didn't exert himself too much then shortness of breath will be the least of his worries.\n* E: Causing blisters, exhaustion and heart attack.\n\n### Question:\nWhy is it that A, B and C are not correct answers?\n\n### Answer: A, B, and C are not correct answer because it was mentioned that the jogger is not able to finish the exercise and is exhausted so the correct answer must be exhaustion. Although it doesn't directly mention that blisters will be caused then that is a possibility. Also it causes heart attack and may contribute to shortness breath and dehydrate.\n\n### Another Question:\nWhat would you advise the jogger to avoid so she/he won't be prone to such problems?\n\n### Another Answer:\nThe jogger should avoid blisters by wearing a pair of comfortable and properly fitted socks.

But at night the moon sets with the sunset and so the time at which the moon sets gets later.  How many times as many years does the moon rise as the sun rises?\n\n### Input The time at which the sun sets and the time at which the day begins depends on the time at which the earth rotates, which changes daily at different parts of the earth depending on its position, and the position of the sun, which changes daily at the same time each day of the year. This problem assumes the earth rotates on its axis once a day and takes 24 hours to rotate. If the earth had been on Earth's equator when the sun set, then the time when the sun set would be 0 degrees, 0 minutes, 0 seconds.

{"text": "The adult man would do what?\n\n### Demostration:\nIf we can find some evidence for all of our choices to support our answer, we use the principle of Occams' razor to eliminate the answer that requires the greatest number of modifications to our knowledge.\n\n#### Answer:Choice D, which does not require us to modify our knowledge about what men actually do to get ready for the day, is the best fit.\n\nThe phrase \"men do to get ready for\" in the question indicates that the act would be done by either an adult man or an adult woman. We are aware of what men do when they dress themselves for work, and so the evidence about A does not match our knowledge about what happens. (Adult men do not typically go through a lot of preparation to get dressed if the clothes they are wearing require no alterations. In contrast, evidence about the act of \"self-dressing\" would be consistent with \"showering\".)\n\nWe are also aware that adult men do not routinely wake up to find someone dressed for them. So we can eliminate C from the list of choices.\n\nThe same logic applies to the \"train\" in \"drink beer and _____ train\". If an adult train were to get ready for work, it would be driving itself, not riding in a taxi.\n\nThe term \"train\" is also not generally used to describe a bicycle, unless that bicycle is used to carry goods within a city. Again, this definition does not apply to drinking beer.\n\nIn general terms, \"an adult\" is a woman. We know that adult women like to \"drink beer\" and \"ride trains\" so, therefore, so do men. So an adult man riding a train does not require any information or definition we are not aware of at the moment.\n\n### Input\nHow old was the man killed in the car crash?

A: \"open meadows,\" 2. B: \"arctic tundra,\" 3. C: \"beach,\" 4. D: \"great outdoors,\" 5. E: \"England\" (England was the only country listed)\n\nOption A, \"open meadow\" is not the best choice. First, \"fox hunting\" is a two person activity. It is more fitting for a \"fox hunt\" to occur in an open field. In an Arctic Tundra (B), there can not be a fox hunting, a fox hunt is typically reserved as being confined to a specific area and a tundra is an area that is spacious and often quite cold at night. It would be physically difficult for a person to be up and about in the middle of the Arctic Tundra as it is often very cold and difficult to find a place to shelter for that long without the proper equipment. Beach (C) would be a better choice for the Fox hunt as long as there is shelter available should the fox get too hot, a fox hunting is not reserved strictly to the beaches and foxes can often be found in or near a forest making a beach one of the best locations to find a fox hunting. Great outdoors (D) would not work as there would be no suitable location to hunt a fox as long as the sun was present and all foxes can be found near water. Option E (E) can not be the answer either as there were too many different choices for the location of England that were not just one choice such as E (England).

{"text": "> A: feeling refreshed\n\n### Explanation:\nThe right answer is A, feeling refreshed.\nWhen you take a shower, your body temperature decreases and you may start sweating.\nIn addition, the water that hits your skin provides water to your skin cells.\nDuring exercise, your body sweats out excess water.\nWhen you take the shower for a while after exercise, you get a lot of extra water to keep your body temperature high.  You get rid of excessive sodium, chloride and lactic acid, which can lead to muscle aches and cramps.\nWhen you exercise, lactic acid builds up in your muscles and causes the pain.  Some people think that if you can drink enough water to take care of these compounds, you will feel less tired.  However, scientists have proven that this method does not work as well as normal exercise.\n\nHowever, if you feel restless, you must take a rest.\n\n#### Feeling less tired\nAnswer: feeling refreshed", "answer": "A: feeling refreshed"}

Another one, D, does not fit the information as family reunion sounds like an event while this is where he was going.\nNow, what about choices C and E? \"Family picture book\" is a bit of a stretch, but the sentence says James is taking his niece, so we will stick with C, that he drove to his brother's house.\n#### C\nAnswer: C\n\n### Input - Adam and John like to walk their dogs.  If they walk their dogs together, the total number of miles they walk per week is even if Adam walks at the same pace as John.  If they walk at the same rate per hour, how many miles does Adam walk per day?\n\n### Response - Let's do this in a few more steps.  It might seem tedious, but this will go by quickly, I promise.\n\n- We are told that John walks at some rate.  We don't know what it is, but we can figure it out later. So, let's say he walks at 2 miles per hour.\n\n- The problem then becomes a matter of proportions, or at least, I think it is.  Adam walks some distance per day, and since he can walk at the same rate as John, he must walk at a higher rate.\n\n- Let me take you to the store.  I hope you don't mind.\n\n- The rate at which John walks is 2 miles/hour.\n\n- The \"rate\" at which Adam walks, is what Adam walks per day.\n- But, if Adam walks at a rate at which he can walk as fast as John, then that means that Adam can walk 2 miles per hour as well.\n\n- Since Adam can walk at the same pace as the much better looking John, and John walk's at 2 miles per day, that means that Adam can also walk at 2 miles per HOUR.\n\n- But in our question, you said that if they walk at the same per hour rate (or, if you think about it, the same", "answer": "C: brother's house"}

While you can get away with using `zip` here, it is easier to accomplish that goal using `zip_longest`.\n\nIf you don't want to use `zip_longest` (but why?), you can make the following modification:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item input", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

{"text": "In order to answer this question we must determine which of the choices has no vowels.  For this, we must count the number of vowels and subtraction the number of vowles from the total number of letters in the choice. From here, we take the remainder of the division of the original word by the rest of the answers.\nIn this case we start with the total number of letters. There are 20 letters in choice A.\nNow, let's subtract the number of vowals. In choice A, there are 2 E's, which are the vowels. So, we subtract 2 from the total number of A, 20.\nNext, we divide A by the total answer, which is 20 total letters. So, 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10\nTherefore, the number of choices we cannot eliminate is choice A.\n#### 20+20+10\nAnswer: A\n\n### Input : Answer the questions about the story.

We know that 10 were at the show, 3 were involved in the accident, we can find the maximum by finding the difference. 4=<<difference>>2 so that means 3 were involved in accident.

Choice A is always efficiency (first letter) and choice E is always getting work done (last letter). Choice E works differently from the other two to determine the answer.\n\nChoices that are close to each other will have the word getting or finishing next to them. Then, Choices that are far from each other will have the words efficiency or work in order to determine the answer. You can also see that the first and last letters of a choice are a \"type\" such as:\n* A: A == Efficiency\n* B: L == Getting\n* C: M == Finishing\n\nHence, you can deduce that the three \"types\" are:\n1. Getting (Work)\n2. Efficiency\n3. Finishing (Up)\n\nNow, with every choice, you can find one choice that is going to have the first letter in the \"type\" and the last letter in the other \"type\". This is because there are only 3 types so therefore you should be able to find the \"type\" with one choice (by looking at the first letter) and use that to deduce the answer.\n```\nInput:A bride and\ngroom are taking\ncare of\nproposals, what is\nthe likely ceremony?\nChoices:\nA: efficiency B: getting\nwork done C: marriage D\nfinishing up E: results\n```\n\n#### Answer\n```\nC = marriage\n```\n\n### Input1:The first half of the quarter is complete.

You can even find people with directions.\n\n### Input and Response\n\n### Instructions:\nYour instructor gave you a piece of advice. The advice is \"don't trust this.\" Explain the significance of the advice. What is it advising you not to do? How will that decision hurt you?\nExplain\n\nYour instructor gave me the best advice to think twice before doing anything. This is because they're not just saying they know best, they have experiences, and a knowledge base that helps to make wise choices. This advice is so true, especially when it comes to life decisions.\n\n#### The instruction:  Write a response in which you explain something that is significant to you. Explain its significance to you and what you have done to keep it.\n\n### Your response:\nThe greatest piece of advice is the advice you give yourself. You can trust the decisions you make more. You learn from the time your decisions were wrong, and when they were right. You can use your past failures as valuable feedback that allows you to make better decisions in the future so that you don't go down the wrong path.\n\n### Summary\nMy response to that advice is: I take that advice and think over my decisions. Sometimes I end up just doing what I was originally gonna do, sometimes I redo my decision, but I always think before I make any big decision.\n\n### Rationale:\nSo this advice means that you should think twice before doing anything without taking it into considerations, otherwise you might get hurt.\n\n### Additional context:\nIn my experience I can say that I really did that quite often. I was doing something, maybe had a bad idea, or just did it without even thinking about it. But most of the time it did turn out to hurt me in the long run, or at least make me waste my time.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo conclude I just want to say that there are many more great things and many better things to do, instead of wasting your time on things that will probably leave a scar on your heart.

{"text": "The person would help the speaker by drinking tea.  Tea, being a beverage, keeps people hydrated and gives them a good energy boost. That way, the tea keeps the speaker awake and makes his or her speaking a little bit easier.\n\n### Rationale A: Drinking tea by itself does not help the speaker at all.  The speaker could be able to move his or her mouth and talk without difficulty.  It is more likely that the tea would be used to help the speaker speak coherently.\n\nRationale B: Coherent speech is when one can put their thoughts together and clearly express them in English.  Therefore, completing a sentence would simply mean making sure that what the speaker is saying is grammatically correct and makes sense.  While a good drink such as tea would not do hurt, the speaker would also need to put in effort and effort is not measured by whether the speaker would drink tea.\n\nRationale C: Crossing the road when not able to speak would get the speaker into danger.  This would then cause the speaker to be upset which would then make the speech difficult to make.  It is possible that the speaker would get even more upset if he or she thought that the listener had misunderstood what he or she was trying to say.  The speaker needs to have a clear thought to express what he or she is saying.  It is not likely that he or she would want to cross roads when not able to speak incoherently which would then make it difficult to do so.  The speaker of the English language would also need to use language that the person listening would understand.  Hence, tea is not directly related to this task.\n\nRationale D: Speakers do not simply express their sentences or thoughts.  Their mannerism is also important.  Hence, they need to make sure to use correct verb tenses in order to maintain the listener's attention. If the speaker is upset or angry then their tone of voice might change.  If a person does not understand what a speaker is saying, the speaker would get angry or frustrated.  As a result, the person would be too distracted to speak coherently.  Hence, feeling angry might make the speaker incoherent. This is a possibility but the speaker needs to be able to think clearly and be coherent to speak well and cross the street.

{"text": "#### A\nAnswer: A\n\n### Input\nA:  In the United States, the number of teenagers (13 to 19 years old) that are binge drinking has been slowly declining over the last few years. Of course, a lot of alcohol use during the teenage years is binge drinking, and that is defined as 10 or more drinks within a few hours.\n\nQ:  What percentage of teenagers in the U.S. are binge drinking?\n\nRationales: Let $x$ be the number of teenage binge drinkers where $x$ is the unknown quantity. In other words, what is $x$%?\nLet's try out 10%:\nGiven $x=10\\%$ of total teenagers  is binge drinking.\n10% of 13 to 18 year olds is???\nLet $t$ be the total number of 13 to __ 18 year old teenagers.\n$t=78.8$ million so $x$ is ~????.\nNotice how we tried out binge percentages, in this case $10\\%$.  If there were 10 8-ounce drinks in a 2-liter bottle, what would that be as a percentage?\nWe can get the answer by taking $10\\%$ of the total number of 8-ounce drinking bottles by saying 10% of the 2-liter bottles were 10 eight-ounce drinks.\nThe total was $27$ bottles so $10\\%$ is ~4 bottles.\n\nA couple of other facts from Wikipedia.

{"text": "If clothes have developed a horrible smell that cannot be removed by washing them, put them in the closet, close it, and hope that the smell goes away. If your house is large enough you could also hang it in the closet. If the house is smaller you should put it in a far-out closet so the person don't have to constantly think about that smell. Choice C sounds dumb because they are already soiled.\n#### C\nAnswer: Choice C\n\n### Rationale:\nHanging things in a closet is an option that I have heard but have never done. People do that when they can't be wasted. But if you have a close-able closet then you could just close the closet and not think about that smell until that closet is opened. It sounds logical, and it has to be correct because it will either be incorrect or it has to be correct, because it is a multiple choice.\n\n### Rationales:\nB is not correct because if the clothes have developed a horrid smell and can'\nt be washed, then the dirty smell will linger on them and the person will continue to smell it and remember about that smell.\nD and E are out because they are both incorrect answers according to the rationale, so it could not be either of them.\n\n### Input.

They ranked last in the league in their category and have the most points per minute.\nRationales for A: According to the statement, the New England Patriots have the second lowest points per minute in the NFL. To have ranked last, the New England Patriot would have been the team with the lowest points per minute.\n\nRationales for C: According to the statement the New England Patriots last season ranked 2nd in their section. This means they were 2nd in the league in points per minute, not first.\n\nRational for E: According to the statement they ranked first in their level. Their lowest points per minute, compared to the other teams, means they ranked first in the level. They did not rank last in the league.\n\nRationals for B: This statement did not give any ranking for any team other than the new England Patriots. The New England Patriots may have ranked second in the league, it does not necessarily mean the New York Giants ranked second in the level.\n\nInput: In a 5-point test, the mean score was 32. In a test at a high school with 11 students, the mean score was at least 28.\nRationales For B: To score 32 in a 100-question test, you only need to answer correctly four questions. To average 32, you need to answer at least 13 questions each correctly. In a 120-point test, the higher the score, the better you did.\n\nRational For C: This statement did not tell if the 11 students all took the test or not, instead it stated that the mean score of the 11 students was at least 26. This means if all 11 students took the test their average score would also at least be 26. Based on the original statement, the average of all 11 students is at least 26 and that means the average score of the whole group of 16 students would at least be 24 which is the answer choice D.\n\nInput: Tanya is a math teacher at a high", "answer": "E: mississippi"}

He is going to use Uber but wants to save 50% on it.

If it costs 50% less in volume, how much can he save if he buys a few more units?\nRationales He needs to consume 1/2 of what he normally does to get 50% savings.\nWithout changing units, he needs to consume 2 more units.\n#### 3\nAnswer: \n\nInput: Tom wants to take a road trip with his family during half term and his budget allows him to spend $1500.

How would you reduce the fraction without cross-multiplying in a more elegant way?\nRationales Because the smaller square has side length 1, the area A is:\n\\[ Area A = 1*1 \\]\nThe larger square has side lengths of 1 AND 3, and the area is:\n\\[Area A = 1*3 = 3 \\]\nThe 3 here is the area of the larger square.

He exercises for 3 hours at a 2-hour-per-hour rate.  How many minutes long is his workout each day?\n\n### Response\nAnswer: 80 minutes\n\n### Demongnstration:\nWhen working at a 2 hour per hour rate, he would work for 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours at a time.\nThe gym closes for 1 hour so his workout is actually 4 hours.\nHence there are 240/4 = <<240/4=60>>64 minutes in a gym.\nThe gyms are open for eight hours in each day except if it is a Monday, in which case it is closed for one hour at the start.\nHence the gym is open for seven hours on each of the other 6 days.\nHence there is 1680/7 = <<1680/4=240>>44 minutes in a gymnasium in total.\nThe gym hours and workout times are also given\n\nThe gym may be open for 8 and 7 hours respectively on each of the remaining six days of the week. Hence there are 1680 minutes divided between the 8 hours available in those days. The gym may also be opened at a time when Bruce is not there, in which case it will be open for 240/7 = <<240*7/4=20>>2 minutes. \n\nWe have to find the total amount of time Bruce can spend working out each day. Hence, we have to find the average amount of time that can be spent at the gym in each day. The time available is 1688*2 + (8*240) + 2 = <<1688*3+8*179+2=2065>>2065. Thus, the total number of gym workouts per week is 2065 minutes. The workouts are each two hours long which", "answer": "B: gorge"}

There was a revolutionary period in American history after 1776. People were no longer angry and felt civil, though some people were angry.

Civil actions are often created for civil people. \n\\item I disagreed with the article when it stated that angry people were a deterrent to civil action. Civil action is a civil action.

{"text": "E\n\n### Rationale:Happiness seems the correct choice for this question. If I am abandoned by friends and do not have anyone to help me, I would most likely feel pretty sad. Grief is most likely to be associated with the loss of someone from ones's life. One option could be solo, but this would more likely be associated with someone feeling alone. In order to feel solitude, wouldn't one simply need to be with oneself? Isolation, while a feeling, does not seem likely to be how one would feel if abandoned by everyone. Finally, pleasure seems to be one of the last things that one would feel if they were to be abandoned by everyone.

Choices:  ball game A, football B, basketball C, hockey D, soccer E.\"\n\n### Response:\"The correct answer is A, soccer.\"\n\n### Rationales: According to the question, the sport played inside is ballgame.\nThe ballgame has to be played by two groups of people, and therefore has to be a team sport.\nThere are only three team sports the question does not specify: ballgame, basketball, and soccer.\nSoccer (choices C or E) would be played inside only if it was a wet sport (choices D or B) or played only outside.\nBasketball (choice B) has to be indoors.\nTherefore, the only remaining sport out of all the choices that need indoors playing are choice C (soccer) and choice A (soccer). \n\n### Ratios:\nAll ratios are in the form of \n\n`<Ratio1>/<Ratio2>`.\n\n### Task:\n#### Answer the following multiple choice question:\n\nFind the percent increase in the population of a village from 2008 to 2016.\n\nInput: The population of a village in 2008 was 3700. Last year, the population of the village was 4050.\n\nRationales: 3700 / 4050 = <<3700/4050=0.92>>0.92\n\n#### 0.92\nAnswer: 0.92", "answer": "D: train station"}

So we begin with Option A. If we look at the choices, then there are 3 choices in total: A, B and D. A and B are the same. In order to determine the option that doesn't fit, we do a table, and the choices that have the same prefix and suffix options can always be eliminated. So, A can be eliminated, unless you know it for sure. You can determine more answer options to choose from by looking for word forms that can eliminate themselves, but most importantly, you must look for the grammar in the sentence.\n\n### Solution: Mark didn't want his ignorance to exist/continue in him.

How much weight should he lose per week?\nRational: The weight he needs to lose = <<<<15*4=60>>6>> <<<<15*1=15>>15\nSo the weight he needs to lose per week (lbs) = /*<<<<15*4*1=60>>15>><<15*1*1=150>>152>><<15*4/60=6>>\nSo <<weight he needs to lose = 6 * 15 = 90 >>.\nHe has <<<<<<4/60=0.117>>a week to lose that weight.\n\n## Input: How much money did Cindy make selling her used books? Choices:  a: 68 b: 88 c: 32 d: 48 e: 98.\n\n## Response:\n\n## Answer: d \"48\"\n\n## Rationale:\n\n## Answer Justification:\n\n## The meaning is not clear, because it's impossible to sell 48 by itself.\n\n## I think \"d\" is the right choice by process of elimination.\n\n## I can only sell 68,88 or 98, but I can not sell 48.\n\n## 48 = 88 or 90\n\n## I think 88 or 48 or 90 is better\n\n## I think a good answer would be B, E or F.\n\n## If the person really thinks \"40\" is the right answer, they might be better off trying B, D or E.

{"text": "If you visit the zoo, and a zoo can be a place to view animals, then the answer is A zoo. If you live in New York, then the answer is D, since we can see animals from many places in New York City as well. If you work somewhere and it is also a place where you can view animals, then the correct answer is choice C, but this option does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Since the answer choices are mutually exclusive (ex: either a zoo or your workplace) and they cannot be both simultaneously true, it is a possibility to select the answer where there are animals at your workplace.

The correct answer choice is (D) Safe.\n\nClarfication: The text, though complex, is meant to inform the reader on how a person plans to get rid of some clothes he or she no longer wants. In order to do this, the man will put various items of clothing in the lawn, donate items to a charity, and put others in a safety deposit box. Thus, he does not go to a jewellery store where he could sell items for cash, but rather to a safty deposit box where he could store his items, without having to deal with security or other issues surrounding selling valuable items at a storefront or street-side store.\n\n## Question Text:\t\nThe only baggage that the woman checked was a small drawstring bag. She said that when she finally had a chance to sit down and look through all of the things she was holding onto, she would go through all of it by deciding on a plan. She began by taking items that she was certain she would never need again and putting them in large garbage cans. For things that she did not know if she would ever want again, she would put them into a big, green jumbo sized garbage bag. When she started to go through her clothes, she put the unused ones in a garage sale pile. After everything she could sell had been either donated or sold, she would pack the rest of the stuff into a large plastic bin and then put it into", "answer": "E: airport"}

{"text": "D is the best option.\n\n### Rationale:\nAccording to the text:\n\n> Driving can be fun, dangerous, illegal, or stressful...\n\nFrom the statement:\n\"Driving can be fun\", \"Dangerous\" is included as one of the other possible options, so we see that stressful and dangerous are different. A and B also differ since A does not include dangerous.\nNext, we see:\n\"...so fun is not necessarily dangerous. Accidents from fun driving can take place, but they are not intended. Illegal and stressful driving are designed to cause accidents.\"\n\nFrom the statement that \"Accidents from fun driving can happen\", we can see that accidents happening from fun driving are not \"designated to cause accidents\". Therefore, having fun is not illegal, and does not \"lead to accidents\". B is not possible.\nNext, we state that \"Dangerous driving is illegal. The speed limit is a rule, not a suggestion. Ignoring it causes accidents. Driving dangerously is a matter of purpose. Fun and illegal driving are sometimes illegal and sometimes not\".\n\n> Drivingt can be fun, dangerous. An accident can occur while driving dangerously, but illegal and stressful driving are intended to cause accidents.\n\n> Illegal driving causes accidents, but accidents from illegal driving are not intended. Accidents from fun and illegal driving sometimes occur.\n\nFrom the statements about illegal driving, we see that the text states that \"illegal driving causes accidents\" and that \"Accidents from illegal driving are intended\". The text also mentions that accidents from legal/illegal driving, such as \"fun and illegal driving sometimes occur\" which indicates that fun/illegal driving do not always cause accidents.\nTherefore accidents from illegal driving could cause accidents, and accidents from illegal driving ARE intended to occur. Illegal driving could cause accidents but accidents from illegal/fun/stressful may NOT cause accidents.\nIllegal driving is B, so we can eliminate it from the options.\nFrom the statement, \"Dangerous driving causes accidents, fun driving causes accidents, illegal driving causes accidents\", we see that dangerous and fun driving causes accidents while illegal driving doesn't.\nDangerous and fun drive can both cause accidents without needing to be intended to", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

At first I was making the same mistake over and over, which frustrated me very much. And when I thought about it, it reminded me of the feeling I got when I began to learn French so I started studying in a different way. I chose an application that has a dictionary, a voice for pronouncing words or even an online partner that you can speak to for practice. It is helping a lot for me to get rid of the misinterpretation and confusion. I have also started to focus more on pronouncing correctly instead of translating every word I know. By speaking or at least practicing what I know, I can learn the words I may not know in the beginning of each day or just for myself while I use the dictionary.

Hands are the only part of John's body that holds his tools, and an injured hand would certainly make it difficult to hold tools properly.\n\n### Analysis:This question tests two important data-gathering skills:\n1. Read the question carefully. Identify the main idea, determine the type of question and clarify what must be true in order to provide the correct answer.\n2. Locate words in the question that provide support for answering the question. A well-written question will include words like:\n\u2022 Always (the correct answer will be true in all situations)\n\u2022 Any (no conditions attached; the correct answer must be true for all situations)\n\u2022 Only (the correct answer must be true in only one of the given cases and must be false in all other cases)\n\u2022 No: Answer will be true in all cases except for one, so the correct answer must be false in all the given cases.\n\n### Conclusion:This question is looking to see if you can gather and interpret information to answer a question.

Although there are only 10,000 bees in a hive, one can take out a queen and there will still be thousands of bees which proves that a beehive can exist without a queen. Because the options do not contain any choices that eliminate other choices, it must be an A.\n#### A\nAnswer :A", "answer": "C: castle"}

The number of children on a street is 34 and is an odd number. What is the number of dogs on the street?\nRationales\nThere are 24 houses on the street. The total number of houses in the street = even number and 24 = <<24=16>>16 houses\nIf the street has 34 children and its total number of children is odd then 34\u201316 = <<34-16=18>>18 children\nAlso we know (16 \u00d7 34) = <<16*34=648>>648 as the total number of houses in odd number times total number of children in odd number. So 648 = <<648=162>>162 houses.\nLet x = the number of dogs on street\nx = (162 \u2013 648) / (18 \u2013 24)\nWe can solve for x by solving the equation x = 162/32 \nWe can rewrite as\nx = 162 / 32 = <<162/31>>162/30\n= 50 / (24)\n= 2 / <<(24/24)>>2\n= 1.\nTherefore the number of dogs in the street is 1.\n#### 1\nAnswer: 1\n\n### Instructor:In a room filled with 50 humans, 7 bears, 6 cats, 11 geese and 13 snakes  there are a total of five odd numbers.

{"text": "D\n\n#### D\nAnswer: D\n\n### Response Explanation:\nCody feels headaches, having stoic behavior, wanting more, and being happy. Since headaches is a feeling, choices A, B, and E can be quickly eliminated. That leaves choices D and C.\nA straw is not useful to a person who cannot see because vision is not important to a blind person. Instead, such a person would find being stoic to be most useful because stoic behavior would enable a blind person to deal more effectively with things that they cannot change, while also preventing them from becoming sad about them.\nHeadaches can be very difficult to deal with and can ruin a day. As such, choosing being happy would not be as useful to a blind person, who cannot enjoy seeing things such as clouds in the sky.\nBeing happy is the third-most important feeling (choices D, C, and E), and would most likely make someone feel more content than other choices. For a blind person who is dealing with the loss of her vision, however, she would likely feel very uncomfortable spending time feeling happy. Instead, she would benefit from being stoic.\nWanting more would help someone who is dealing with a situation where they feel like they do not have enough, such as not having enough money. A blind person, however, would not feel that it is useful to find more ways to work because, since they cannot see, they would not be able to effectively use money anyways.\nFor somebody who struggles with the concept of being blind and losing their vision, losing anything else may seem easy. Feeling more content in what they do have, in this case a state of stoicism, would help a blind person feel better, while also making it easier for their headaches to go away. Thus, being stoic would be the most important because it would help both their headaches and mood, as well as making it easier to deal with their blindness. This can be a quick way to tell if you are correct with the answer or not.\nBecause Cody is blind we can know he needs to be stoic because feeling happy will not be helpful and wanting more is not something someone who is blind needs in their life so that leaves us with headaches and being happy which means Cody needs to be stoic so D is the correct answer.\n\n\n### Input/Output Format:", "answer": "D: being happy"}

A. How many ounces of cheese bread does she have? B. How much does each ounce of cheese bread cost if a pound of cheese bread costs $24.00? C. How much does each package of cheese bread cost?\n\n### Rationales: A: Susan ordered 2 packages of cheese bread and each were 4 ounces each. Thus, she has 8 ounces of cheeese bread.\nB: A pound of cheese is $24. Each ounce of cheese is 1/4 part of a pound, thus each is $6.\n\nC: To find out how much it cost for each package, you need to calculate the ratio of the cost of one pound to one ounce of cheese. Because each package is 4 ounces of cheesebread, and 4 ounces is 1/4 of a pound, you need to multiply the ratio of $6 to $24.\n$6:24 = 1/4:\n4 * 6 = 24:\n$6: 24 = 1:\n$6: $1 = 5.\n\nThen, you take that 5 times the cost of the 4 ounce package to determine the cost of the total package. \n\n$12:24 = 5:\n$6:4 = 3:\n$6:14 = 15 : 2.5\n32:5 = 6.4\n\n5 *  4 = 20:\nTherefore, each package is $16:20.", "answer": "E: internet sites"}

At the end of the week, she had $2 left in funds each day. How much does Tapanga spend on a dog?\n\n### Answer 1: Groceries = $10 = <<10=10>> 10 a day\n\nTapanga has to spend $10 at the grocery store every day. If she has $2 a day after groceries, she will have $2*$10 = <<2*10=20$$20>> $20 left for the whole week.\n\n### Second response for Choice 1: Choose A\n\nAnswer 2: $20 = <<20=20>> $2 per meal. In total Tapanga spends $2 for each meal 5.\n\n### Answer Choice 2: B.  The total number of candies Sam made was 256.\nCandies = $2 * 120 = <<2* 120=240$$240>> $240.\n\nThen 256 = $(240 + 12 + 8)$\n\n$$240 + 8 + = <<240+8+12=252$$$252>> 252 candy.

{"text": "C)\n\nInput:Why would a company want to be going public?\nThere are several reasons:\nThe company becomes more efficient when it is publicly traded because the company is now listed as a potential investment for many of its potential clients worldwide.\nBecause it takes more time to do research before funding a private enterprise than a public enterprise listed on the stock market, a private enterprise is often better suited to fundraise from the stock market than a private enterprise.\n### Multiple Choices\n\nChoice A: A company should not reveal certain information to the public. An investor who has a financial interest in the company will often receive confidential financial information before the public investor does. As a result, the company would not be able to provide both the public and private investor with the same market information.\nChoice B: A company should go public to avoid ridicule. Publicly listed companies are required to disclose information about their financial status to the public investors. If a private company were to disclose its financial status to a small group of private investors, the company could be ridiculed for not being transparent about its financial health.\nChoice C: A company should go private instead of public to prevent problems. A public company is required to disclose financial information to the public. As such, a company's finances may remain a private matter if it is a private company. As a result, a public company can avoid scrutiny and problems.\nChoice D: A company does not need more funding to go public. A publicly traded company is required to provide financial information to the public, and this is why they go public in order to get more funding.\nChoice E: A company should go to get more capital from the stock market. A publicly trading company is typically more profitable than a private company, because it can issue shares to the public and attract more public investors.\n\n### Multiple Choice 2\n\nChoice A: It is best to have a market share of 55% of the total potential market, with 50% of the market being the market you compete in.\nChoice B: It is best to try to get as close to the market share of 50% possible.\n\nComment: Incorrect choices, please update it.\n\nComment: Answer will be the same 50% in a", "answer": "D: more funding"}

There were two more bags total than there were people. Each person had one fewer bag than there were bags total. How many bags total?\n\n### Response (with explanation!): There were two more baggages total that the people had, which means Tapanga and one of the other family member had one more bag than the other family members. If we sum the number of bags that Tapanga has and the one extra bag the other family member has, we get 2 more bags than the whole family, which explains why we get a total of 2 additional bags. Using the same logic, we can subtract the number of bags Tapanga has and one of the other two family members have to get the remaining amount of bags. If we know how many bags Tapanga and the other family member have, in total, we will be able to know how many bags total the family has. This means that we can find out how many bags Tapaanga and one of her family members have by subtracting the number of bags the other two family members had.\n\n### Explanation : We can tell how many baggages Tapanga and one other family member have by subtracting the baggages the other two families have. The family total can be found by adding all of the baggages together.\n\n### Test Case\n\n### Instructions \n\n### Output\n\nTapanga and the whole famly are doing their last-mile shopping for the holiday's.

Also, as the choices show, someone selling for drugs would not go to a jewelry store, a pawn store, or a hock store - they would sell it to a fence at a drug house, where drug bargains are made or to another dealer and then the drug is cut with something else. He could go to those stores to buy a watch to sell, though. A charitable cause, on the other hand, means a trusted person who wants the watch, knows what the real value of it is, and can be trusted to keep their word by not reselling it. On eBay, a person who wins must pay the full ticket price for the watch, which would be more money than he would receive at a fence, drug house, or other place to sell the watch for drugs.\n\n### C. He went to the pawn shop.\n\nShe would give it to a charity, because if the watch was a clock only (not a watch) or any item that had some type of sentimental value to her, she would give it away to a trusted person or place to be with her family. If it was a watch she received from someone in her immediate family, she would put it in an \"upstairs\" room and look at it with her grandparents.

This stage of sleep lasts for only a few minutes before the cycle goes back to where it started. \nWhen we reach deeper stages of sleep, such as REM, we do not dream. Also, critical thinking would not immediately make a person feel more alert since it is a mental activity that takes time and effort.

How many students were at the school last year?\nRationales\nWhen the number of students rises 10%, that means that now there are _10% more students_ than last year.\nSince we know there are 10% _more_ students, we know that last year the school had _10% less students_.\nThe numbers of students can be set up with an equation:\nthe equation is set up as x \u2013 10%, which means the school had x \u2013 10% last school year.\nSo to find the x for the set up, we must solve the equation, which gives us 1.1 x = <<x=1.1>>1.1 times the new number of students.\nNow that we know x, it means the school had 1,100 students last year, which is answer E.\n#### 1100\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: The first time you buy a piece of luggage, the store offers you the next suitcase in your purchase.

How many suitcases are needed to get a suitcase without an asterisk?\nRationalesThe statement says if you buy two bags, you get the next as your reward, and if you buy five, you get the next three, and if you buy another five, you get one less than the next.\nSo let the first bag be bag 1, the second bag be bag 2, the third bag be bag 3, the fourth bag be bag 4, and the fifth bage be bag 5.\nWe can represent the amount of bags in each set of bags with the value of the variable X.

{"text": "E is correct:\nAfter becoming inebriated, it is likely that someone will be able to speak intelligently and not make a fool out of themselves. However, they may be uninhibited and share personal information to strangers or share it with their loved ones. It is also possible that they become extremely rude and unpleasant, leading to social isolation in some situations.\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Hints:\n\ud83d\udca1 \n\n#### Speaking Deliberately\nA way to keep people from thinking bad of you on social media or in general is to speak deliberately, with patience and deliberation. You can think of the three types of language: explicit, implicit or nonverbal. You may also want to learn about the different ways that you can talk. By using deliberative language, you can help people understand the intention of your words and keep up your confidence when you encounter difficulties.\n#### Explicit, Implicit, or Nonverbal\nExplicit communication is the primary method of communication used by most people in this world. It involves the use of words, gestures, and sounds. It is also where most of the communication you know takes place. You speak so you can understand each other. This method of communication uses the most common symbols to convey meaning.\nImplicit communication happens when you use more than words, gestures, or sounds. This type of communication occurs when you use body language or facial expressions, for example. People can be good or bad at using implicit communication, but this kind of communication does not always mean they are good people.\nNonverbal communication is the least known form of communication, but it is also the most important. There are many nonverbal ways for you to communicate with other people. You can tell them that you are in danger by doing certain body movements or facial expressions. You can also tell them if you are happy or sad by using specific facial expressions or body movements without using words.\nLearning how to talk in a language you understand is very difficult, and some people even never reach this point. This does not mean you cannot understand someone else's language if you are a native speaker of the language. You need to understand the person's language if you want to be able to communicate with them, and you need to know how to speak to a person in their language.

J: 6,00 * 6,00 = 36,000 (7 = 7) * 7 = 49,000. 6,00 + 6,00 - 36,0 00 49,0 00 - 43 = 19,000, which is closest to 50 so if you were to list the numbers in order they would look like this 50,19,0,00,0,0. This is why answer J is the sum would look like this: 50430 19,0,6,0,00 4900 which is closest to 49,0,0. So answer  H is closest to 43.\n\n### Rationales: J: 600", "answer": "A: holding"}

{"text": "Answer using the correct reasoning.\n\n#### A\nA: No go\nThere are three reasonable answers which are all incorrect: Impossible, Unlikely and impossible. The reason that these three answers are incorrect is because they all describe an inability to do an action (impossible to do something, unlikely to be able to do an action, and an inability to do something).\n#### E\nE: Impossibility\nThe correct answer is option E. This is because 'impossibility' is an adverb and a noun. In addition, the usage of the expression 'easiest possible' suggests that a noun should be used. Since 'easiest possible action' is a phrase this makes it impossible.\n#### D\nD: Inability\nThis answer should be incorrect as well, since it does not make sense to say that someone is unable to do the simplest action. It only makes sense to describe someone as being unable to do something if they are able to do it but do not want to do it.\n#### C\nC: Unlikely\n'Impossible' and 'unlikely' are both synonyms according to Merriam Webster. However, 'impossible' is usually used more often in reference to describing someone's ability to do something. Since 'impossible' can be used to describe whether or not someone can do something and 'unlikely' can be used to simply describe how likely something is, then the correct answer is D.\n\n#### B\nB: Unlikely\nThis choice is also incorrect. 'Unlikely' is often used to describe how likely something will happen or not happen. Unlikely describes how likely something is to not happen.\n### Input:\nThis is a question with three different possible answers.\nCan you find a simple and correct answer for each possible alternative given below?\n\n### Instructions:\nSara, Bono, and Javier ate an omelette for breakfast.

A master of understanding is not a master of their craft, because everyone is likely to understand their craft.\n* Incorrect: It should not be Choice D because the sentence doesn't describe what a \"bargemaster\" is.

{"text": "E\n\n### Explanation:\nThermal energy is a form of energy that arises from the average kinetic energy of particles of matter. It is also referred to as heat. The temperature is in direct correlation to the thermal energy in a system (of matter). Energy in the forms of motion (kinetic energy) and vibration and rotation (internal energy) are in constant motion when the system is in an equilibrium state. A system can move from one state of equilibrium to another through a transformation or a change. When heated, atoms and molecules move faster and faster within a system until the kinetic energy of the particles matches the thermal energy released in the form of light and other radiation in the infrared (IR) band. Radiation, including light, is a form of heat.\n\n#### 5\n\n### Input \nWhat did Jared do?

{"text": "### Rationale: E: Exercise\n\n* Rationale: E: You have to break the calories, the fat down into little tiny parts (aka ATP) to make use of that energy. This is possible because your body is always breaking down substances (sugars and fat) and producing ATP. This is called aerobic energy: ATP-CP cycle or \"Bridge\"\n* Input: The energy of the food that you ate during the day is measured by how much oxygen has been used in the process of breaking down those foods into ATP in your mitochondria (and anywhere else in your body). During exercise your oxygen consumption multiplies many-fold.\n* Output: Oxygen combines with glucose to produce carbon dioxide and water molecules. This is what you feel coming from the exercise.

So, in the second step, you assume that the remaining parents of 42 were approached.\nStep 4: From step 3, you can now determine how many parents bought a $10 raflle ticket (P) and how many didn't buy a ticket (N).\nStep 5: Finally, add the number of parents that wanted to support the school and the number of parents who didn't buy a rafle ticket and subtract the number of the remaining parents who didn't want to support the school.\n\nInput: Step 1 :70 tickets were bought and 42 Parants were left to be approached => 70+42=<<70+42>>\nStep 2 :In the second step, assume that all remaining 42 Parants that weren't approached and they bought tickets.

In this case, a piece is a sixth, so the first fraction is 6/(15*6) = <<6/90>>6/90\nEach fraction represents the ratio of the denominator. However, 15 = 5*3 (denominator to denominator). Therefore, the top number is a 3rd of the bottom number, so in this case, a fraction of 6 is taken.

Since both sides are integers \\implies the largest integer that $x<7$ and the smallest integer that $x>3$. \\implies $x=3$\nSo we are looking for the number of donors who donate $3$.\nTheir number must be even, since every even number is divisible by 2. For example, $2x+1=3,2x-1=3$.\n\nThe next prime is $5$ and $5 \\not \\mid 3 \\implies 5$ is not a multiple of $3$.\n\nTherefore, there are $2$ donors who donated $3$. $5$ donors who donate evenly.\n$11$ donors who don't donate enough to match the given amount.

There are higher interest charges therefore people need to pay more to get things.

{"text": "Choice E: the Zoo\n\n### Rationales:\nWe first identify which of the choices we know is false.\nChoice D is false because there is no \"beaver\" in British Columbia's name.\nChoice B is false because there is a large, freshwater lake in British Columbia's capital, Victoria.\n\nChoice C is false for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe ocean, which is choice C, is generally thought to be a sea. There are different definitions of a \"sea\", but a common one is that it may refer to any large body of water surrounding a small land-area. Therefore, it seems a little unlikely that a beaver would leave its water to go to a landlocked area.\nThere is no \"beaver lake\" in the ocean. There is Lake Victoria, which is a large freshwater lake on Africa's great lakes. \"Beaver Lake in the National Capital Region\", however, can be located in Ottawa, Ontario. There's no British Columbia in sight.\n\nLastly, there is a \"beaver tail\" in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThus, choice E is the only answer left.\n\n**If you look closely at the instructions, you might notice that the number of answers is incorrect. \nThe number of choices you have to choose from is: D(4)-A(1)-B(4)-E(1), so the answer should be option D, British Columbia, not Answer: Answer: B**\n\n### The Rationales:\nOur first task is to notice which option is false. B is false for multiple reasons, chief of which is that Lake Victoria, the freshwater lake that is located in the capital city of British Columbia, Victoria, is quite large with a surface area of 6,883 square miles (17,800 square km).\nSince D is also false, one or both options cannot be true. Therefore, A is the only choice that must be true.\n\nFrom here, we're tasked with finding the remaining truth. There are a couple of ways to choose the answer, but they can be categorized into two major paths:\n\n>1. Choose an answer without knowing its truth or falseness, and then check its truth or falsiness later.\n2.

There may be restaurants at malls, but they would certainly not target the type of clientele which the average businessperson visits a hotel.

The formula for square root for large numbers is (sqrt)(x) = (sqrt)((1/2)(x). This means x = (1/2)sqrt(sqrt) x. Since (1/2)squared = 1, squareroot is just reciprocal of (1/2). So, our formula is sqrt(1/2)((sqrt) x) = (sqrt)(sqrt(x). Now, if we take sqrt(9) = 3, (sqrt)((sqrt x)) = 3, and thus we have 3 = (sqrt)((sqrt)(sqrt x).

Teams A and C are playing each other. Team B and Team D are playing each other, and each team has an equal chance of winning. Which scenario is possible for the game?\n#### Rational: If two teams A and C have the same chance for winning a game, then it is possible that they both lose the game or that they both win the game. If all four teams have an equal chance of winning, then all four teams must win every game they play, including the game in which two teams play each other.

{"text": "In the real world, we buy many things such as food, clothes and accessories, electronics, books, games, and so on. At first, the only way to purchase these items was through money (cash) or by exchange of goods. However, to have a more hassle free and safe way of purchasing these items, many retail outlets started issuing cards for their customers to allow them a more convenient way of shopping. These cards offer convenience to the buyer and also to the seller.

Since there is more than one possible answer choice, you will need to set up an inequality. One formula for comparing quantities expressed as fractions A/B and C/D is A/B > C/D, since if you multiply the top fraction by the bottom fraction, the product must be equal to the bottom numerator (number above the line) multiplied by the bottom denominator (number after the slash). When you use this formula, you can find the answer choice that Kia did not buy by subtracting the top number in the equation with \"A/B > C/E\" from the bottom number with C/D. For example, if you wanted to do \"9/45 > 2/5\", then you would subtract 2/5 from 9/45, get 9-2/9-25, and find 4/25 which yields 16/25, which cannot be read as a fraction.

Can you guess what it is?\n\n### Demostration :If my 6 digit number were 123456 as you describe it is then the total of my digits would be ((12 + 2)*3) + ((12 + 3)*2) + ((12+4)*1) = 27 + 6 + 1 = 34\nThis makes my question which is asking the multiple of the the total? I'll multiply each digit by it's number. This is 1000 * (1000 * 2 * 3 * 1 * 2 * 4) = 1*1000*2*1*1*100**4 = 9000*10^4 = 90**10^4 = (9*1*10^3*10^4) = 9009\n\n### Input:(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8) is a number where the sum of each digit is twice the sum of the other digits. What is this number?\n\n### Rationale:Each digit has it's own sum. Multiply these sums by their number. 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8 = 1*243*504 = 110*4*", "answer": "A: birthday party"}

Ava is telling her mom about the school assignment she is working on. She says her teacher wants her to write the report on the different ways animals eat other animals and their predator and prey. Her teacher is having her do a report on an animal she has chosen from the zoo. Her mother helps her determine the name of the animal and types of food. Write a response that describes a response her mother could make to her.\n\n### Writing:\nWrite a response in which you develop your own point of view on the topic, and use evidence from the text to support your ideas.\n\n### Example:\nAva's family recently took a trip to the zoo. Ava remembers that the animals at the zoo are all looking for food to fill their stomachs.\nAva and her mom both enjoy spending time at the zoo. Ava is learning to write a report on an assignment from school. The teacher wants Ava to learn about prey and predator, so she can write about the natural food the animals eat and what they do to protect themselves.\nAva explains that she wants to write about a pig that loves to eat bamboo. Pigs are omnivorous animals, and so they also eat small vegetables and meat.\nAva's mom explains that the pig is an animal of prey. The pig eats the food that it loves most, which grows abundantly in tropical environments such as the zoo. Ava's mom explains the difference between being prey or predator. In general terms, if an animal has to hunt for its food, it is a predator.\nAva is excited to start her report, and thinks that the pig is a good choice because her teacher wants the children to choose from animals at the zoo.\n#### Ava and her mom discuss the characteristics of an omnivore. Omnivores have broad diets that include both animals and plants. Some animals are prey or meat eaters.\n#### For example: The bears at the zoo are omnivores that eat carrion and fish.

It was a little girl whose hair was a dark black and whose eyes were a dark brown. How much money did the scientists spend to make this little girl?\n\n### Response\n1.5 points\n\n### Demonnstration\nThey were able to clone the girl because they spent a lot of money on the process. The actual cloning process cost between 10,000 and 100,000 dollars. But they also had to pay for the research that went into the cloning and the testing the clones went through. So lets add each. The research was actually pretty cheap. It probably cost them no more than 5,000 dollars and the testing cost them about 10 dollars per hour. Each of the hour we're going to assume the doctor took to test one clone cost 10 dollars. So in this case they cloned the girl because they spent about 125,000 to make the first human clone. Now they knew that creating an actual person from a clone is not cheap but it is actually more expensive to have a new healthy person than the clones. Healthy women are going to be on average 25 to 30 thousand dollars more expensive. So the scientists spent 125, 000 and also they gave the little girl a lot of love and protection.\n\n### Rationales\nFirst they need to calculate the research and then the testing. The research cost about 5,00 dollars the testing about 10,0 dollors so that in total the scientists spent about 15,000 or 20,000. Now you know that a baby costs something like 20, to 30,000 right?

{"text": "John would avoid going to a pet store because he really loves animals and doesn't believe in animal abuse. He also wouldn't go to a parking lot because dogs go to the bathroom there and then their owners clean it up and he does not want to smell any of that. He also doesn't like going to woodland because he doesn't like bugs and he does not like to see the animals in the wild because he thinks that the animals will get shot by the hunters in that place.  Lastly, he wouldn't like to go to any park because he doesn't want to be around kids and people that are rude.\n\n### Rationales:I think that John wants to avoid places that animals are killed. His first choice is pet stores and it makes sense to me because even if he is going there, he would want to be sure that he is not buying animals that were killed or treated badly by pet stores, or if he is going to the pet store to adopt an animal, he doesn't want it to be an animal that was killed by the pet store. I think he would go to a park and not a nature preserve, though, because he wants to go to a place that is easy for him to get to and get away from so he can see the animals there in person but I think if he was to end up going to the nature preserve, he would end up adopting the animals there because he is a very kind and understanding person.\n\n#### 5", "answer": "A: pet store"}

Vet Clinics.\n\n### Answer:\n1.Vet Clinics\n\n### Input from teacher:\nExplain why 'vacation' is not a viable answer.\nTeacher:The term \"vacation\" can be used for both a noun and verb. A vacation is a time taken off from work or school for rest or travel. As a verb \"to vacate\" means \"to leave an office or room because your position, duties are filled or performed by someone else\". In this case though, you can't \"leave an office\" like a normal house. People can't go on vacation where they work. Unless, they're talking about taking off from work/going on maternity leave (i.e. having a baby in the office?).\n\n### Student 1:\nTeacher:To sum it all up: \"vacation\" = a time (noun/verb) off from work/school. To \"vacate\" = to physically leave any place, including \"the office\". It can't be a good answer because what the question is asking for is a place where you can find a pet-care facility, pet food and supplies, and insurance.\n\n### Student answer:\nTeacher response:\nYou can buy pet food at grocery stores which are not considered \"pet care facilities\" therefore, an answer would be a pet store or a veterinary clinic where you can also get pet food in addition to the other services you mentioned. The grocery store option is too broad.\n\n### Teacher 2:\nOkay I have now read that answer. I am not going to accept it, because it doesn't", "answer": "E: shopping center"}

{"text": "B is the correct option. We can assume that D = body is wrong because the question never says that the person is the goal. We can also tell that he/she is wearing some articles of clothing so the answer that would cover those would be C. We wouldn't assume for sure that the answer is A because the arm might be the main protectant, but B could as well because it's part of the body. We can also assume that the road is not the protectant because he would have to roll onto the armor. So we can assume that the body or garment is right.\n\n### Response Rationale:\nFrom the previous point, we see the following response choices:\n\nA = <<106=leg>>leg\nB = <<110=garment>>garment\nC = <<112=torso>>torso\nD = <<135=body>>body\nE = <<139=road>>road\n\nRationales:\n```ruby\n150 = <<9/4=22/6=150>>150\n```\n\nSo,\n\n```ruby\n100 = <<9/3=22/5=100>>125\n```\nAnd the first option is the largest one (legs are the smallest body part),\n\n```ruby\n90 = <<9/2=22/3=90>>69\n```\n\nSo 90 is smaller than 125 and the second option(legs) is larger than the third option(body), so option (2)(garment/clothing) is the answer.\n\n### Input:\"What number is this the 2nd division?

So this is a multiples of 5, and 50 is the 2nd number, 50 + 50 = 100.\"\n\n### ResponseRationale:When we take the number 34, we can break it down until it's simplified.

We get a value of 8.\nChoices B and C: 4 - 3 = 1 (if we ignore the parentheses), but the negative sign next to 7 is causing us to subtract three negative numbers, making -3. This makes a value of -3. If we ignore the negative sign and use the same procedure of using the \"normal\" subtraction rules we see that -3-7=8.\nChoice D: 8-(-3)=11. If you add any three negative numbers, like 3/-4/1, 9/-7/-2, or 6/-8/2 the sum of the integers will always be positive. To show this you must add the signs on the integers in your sum to the sum itself and the sum of the signed integers will always be greater than zero. 2-3= -1, 2-(-3)=4, 6-8=2; these three sets are not similar at all, but they all have the same answer.\n\n### Input\n\n**Molly**\n\n**Rachael**\n\nWhat is the sum of their", "answer": "A: bathroom"}

When you look at Excel, it has different columns, which make it easier to keep in track with my task. Everyone has his or her own different columns for the bridge, and pantyhose. But those columns are all used for the same thing: hold things up. Therefore, I would choose to use columns because they are commonly used for that purpose.\n\n### Input :What are some things that can be used to make the width of an equation larger?\n\n### Response : Choose one (1) item from the list to answer using complete sentences or a bulleted list:\n* AlgeBlocks\n* Comic Sans\n* Larger fonts\n* White board\n* Colored marker\n* Color pencils\n\nI would use Larger fonts because the font I am using to the text is smaller. I have to make it bigger so that the text is easier for people to read. This can make the text to be more clear. The text will not be easy to read.

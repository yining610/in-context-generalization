{"text": "Answer: D\n\n### Feedback:\n  A tax collector (revenue officer) is employed to collect the taxes that are owed. In other words, someone who collects taxes from the public and submits them to the IRS is collecting taxes.\n  As a taxpayer, your tax returns are sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n  Some people think that if they file their income tax return early and don't owe, then the government will give them a refund of whatever is left over after they compute your taxes. Instead, the government sends you a tax bill if you owe money and a refund check if you owe no money.\n  Satisfaction often comes after you've saved some money while getting a tax deduction.\n  You feel bad if your creditors call you and hassle you for money that you owe them. When that happens, you don't have any money to spend on what you want, or you're afraid that you might not have any money left to pay your bills.\n  \n  If a credit card company calls and informs you that they have charged you a late fee, you should pay that late fee as it is a legal debt, you owe it, and you have to pay that invoice. The reason you didn't pay that bill when they first charged it to you is because, for some reason, you didn't have enough money then. Because of that, the credit card company charged you a late fee and a finance charge, also. You're paying one of those charges, you should also pay the other charge. This will help to make sure that you don't become delinquent again.", "answer": "B: satisfaction"}

Then 63+87 = 150\n\n### **B.** Explanation B, 21 x 4 = 84. That equals 140.\n\n### Input\nAlice needs to drive 40 miles to buy dog food.  She wants to divide the trip into 2 equal parts so she can buy the dog food on the way home. Alice knows the car can go 60 miles per tank, and she has 7 tanks of gas. If her car gets 20 miles to the gallon, how many gallons does she buy?\n\n### Response\nAlice buys 12 gallons.\n\n### Explanaiton\n\nThere are 4 tanks, and 7 tanks total.  7 tanks divided by 2 will give us 3.5 tanks.  3.5 tanks minus 4 tanks will be equal to -0.5 tanks. Alice now needs to change the number from negative to positive. If she has 7 tans of gas and she needs 22 to be positive, she needs to divide 7 by 2 to equal 3.5.  \nNow that Alice has 3.5 tans of gas, all she needs to do is divide 3.5 by 2 to equal a gas amount of 1.75 tanks. Now Alice needs to find out in what range her car is getting 20 miles per gallon. She needs 1.75 times 20 and that equals 35.  \nFor the last step, we find out what number equals 35. We need to divide 35 by 1.75 and that equals 19.676 which rounds to 19 miles per gallon.   \nNow", "answer": "A: drill"}

The interest you have to pay depends on\n\n- the time it takes for the item to be paid off,\n- the amount that was purchased, and\n- the interest rate that was agreed for.\n\nThe amount that was purchased is referred to as the principal amount. If you have purchased an item for $1,000 and agreed to pay it off in 12 monthly installments along with a 12% interest rate, then the monthly payment comes to $107.45. The interest part of the payment is referred to as the interest. This is due to the fact that the interest rate for credit is usually higher than the interest rate for savings. So, if you were to deposit $1,00 in your savings account, the interest would only be approximately $10 in twelve months, which is too low to pay your monthly installment for the item you purchased, as the monthly installment comes to almost $110.", "answer": "A: trunk"}

{"text": "Ben didn't kill himself in a ditch, but rather lived under the bridge.\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: How would I write an input like that?\n\nComment: @GusHunt Well, let's say, you have a variable input, which is a string containing all text in bold. Then, inside of your while()/for() loop, you have a for loop, which iterates over each letter in your string. Then every letter you run this code \"Answer: (answer to your question)\". After you're finished you have a string full of answers.\n\nComment: @Satrap I really don't understand, but if we wanted to make the response say \"5\". We could say\n\n```while(i>=0)\n  if(i==A)\n    print(Answer=5)\n  i+=1```\n\nIs it easier to do it that way?\n\nComment: Well, that way is easier. But the first way is more dynamic because you can add any question, that way you have to add the whole code.\n\nComment: I added a little example...\n\nComment: @gusHunt If you want a more precise approach to what is being asked than \"do whatever you want to do\", I'd recommend removing the word \"task\" in the title and then removing \"write a task\" from the body and having someone else answer the question if that person needs a more precise answer than the current wording of the question. That said, I would really like it if this question remained as a general guide, instead of a specific answer, so if the wording is changed it would be great if other people could edit it back to general guidance, thanks.\n\nComment: To my knowledge, this task, as it is currently worded, is asking for any way to get the right answer to each question, with no particular way being better than another except for personal preference.

{"text": "The Right Choice is \"E\"\n\n### A: Very ugly - What happens to every beautiful woman in a model competition? They are beautiful because of some traits which cannot be seen at the naked eye. The ugliness would not stop anyone to compete in modeling competitions. The fact is that people compete in model competitions with good reasons why they should be chosen by judges as the winner.\n\n### B: appear beautiful - In a model competition, the beauty of the models cannot be achieved by only modelling. What are the other skills that are needed for them to be called as beautiful in model competitions? The other skill sets are acting, walking, and modelling. People who become models only because of their appearance (as a human) can be seen in other competitions where they are used to be actors such as movie. If the model competition requires them to act or to walk, the only thing that can make them appear beautiful is modelling. They cannot become the winner in a model competition because of their appearance.\n\n### C: free slaves - People who get job offer from modelling companies, would be considered as beautiful? No. Although there are people who are models who are beautiful, they are not free slaves. They are paid to model. If they are free slaves, there are also good reasons for why they are chosen to be the model. The other skill sets mentioned earlier are also needed to be a chosen as the model by the judges. Even the fact why they are free slaves has an importance for they are the one who will model. Not an act, but the people who model.\n\n### D: Pay bills - A person who cannot pay their bills with or without modelling is considered as ugly. This is how ugliness is considered (by the people who think or believe that ugliness is equal to badness and evilness).\n\n### E: suffering pain - If a person suffers pain when a model is chosen to be the winner, then the winning model deserved the award for they have suffered the pain and they still become the chosen model.\n\n## 5.

In JavaScript, the `String` type holds one piece of data as a string(that is, as a string of text) and the `Array` type holds a collection of items in either an unknown type or a type that the developer specifies. One of the useful Array type utilities is `indexOf()`,which helps to find the location of a given value within the Array.\n2. Another useful Javascript Array utility is `map()` that is used to convert each item in an Array into a new value.\n\n3. In order to use the `indexOf()` and/or `map()` methods, an array needs to be initialized where the first element is the variable we want to manipulate. The index of a variable can be either an index number or reference to the item(object) in the Array.", "answer": "A: botanical garden"}

{"text": "The correct response is \"The reward money\".\n\n#### Rationale\n\nIf the question were about hurt feelings, problems or trouble then Sean would not have been lying. The question is asking about Sean's scaredness.\n\nIf the question was about Sean's worries about being found out, then hurt feelings, problems/trouble and being found out is what he was worried about. The question is asking what specific part of the body Sean was worried about.\n\nIf the person did not read the question carefully, then they would assume that being worried about what part of the body Seen could not lie about.\n\n#### Improper Responses:\n\n### Response 0.1:A\n\n#### Rationale:\n\nIf this response was the answer to this question then that would mean that Sean had lied and hurt someone's feelings. Sean says that he lied. This response would be incorrect, as he did not lie about someone's feelings.\n\n### Response0.2:\n\n#### Rationale :\n\nIf this response were the answer to this question than that means that Sean was lying, but that doesn't make any sense. Sean's body was being found.\n\n### Example: Response:0.3\n#### Rationale : \n\nResponse 0.3 doesn't fit. Even though it seems a good answer, it doesn't really make sense.\n\n### Improper Response: Response: 0.4\n\n#### Rationale  :\n\nResponse 0 wouldn't fit because if that was the correct response, than Sean wouldn't have been worried about the body being found. He probably would've been more worried about someone finding out that he lied and about hurting someone's feelings. \n\n#### Rationale B:\n\nResponse 1 wouldn't really fit either. This is response 0.4.\n\n### Responses 0.5 and 0.6:\n\nThe responses 0.5 and0.6 are not really responses but are distractors.\n\n#### Rationale A:\n\nThe body doesn't have to be there. Just like 0.5 distracts from the actual answer is 0.6 is also a distractor. The body is lying", "answer": "C: being found out"}

{"text": "He was scared due to the smoke detector alarm.\n\nInput:John spent all summer reading great comic books with his friend Rory. He spent 5 days each on the books 'Doctor Strange' and 'Invincible Iron Man'. He read 3 days each on the books \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" and \"Astonishing X-Men'. How many comic books did he not read?\nAnswer: 9\n\n#### Instruction:\nThis problem can be solved using simple addition.\n\nFirst, we subtract the number of days John didn't read any books (9), from the total number of comic books he read (13). By doing this, John would be left with 4 books that he didn't read.\n\n### Input\nWe are told that, if we subtract the number of the days John didn't care about any books (9), then John would be left with four books he didn't read (13 - 9 = 4). The key here is what information is needed to answer the question in this example. This allows John to know how many days he read each book and what books he didn't have.\n\n**Instruction**: The instruction says to solve this problem by subtracting the number of days John spent reading comic books from the total number of days that John read comic books.\n\nThe instruction says to subtract the number of days that John _read_ comic books by the number of days that he read comic books, making this easier to comprehend. This problem is in a format that allows it to be quickly solved.\n\n### Response\nThe way we approach these questions is with an instruction, then an equation to follow up with.

You will see that most names are associated with a job title, an initial code for that job based on the AAPAM (Association of American Professionals and Managers). The code will appear in parentheses after the job title. Some names are associated only with their job titles such as \"Manager.\"\n\n* You will see that for many of the titles (a majority?) there are two to five numbers after the title (for example: \"Account Specialist\" is followed by 3 different salaries). These numbers refer to the person's pay grade. Each person is paid a grade that may be different from the other employees of the same title or job. Each salary is given in U.S. dollars, and all money is in U.S. cash, not cheques. Your job is to find the employee with the lowest salary for each of the ten different jobs listed and write their names in the blanks below.\n\n* Write the employee's full name in the appropriate place. If you find more than one employee with the lowest salaries for a title, choose one from the pair. \n\n### Demostration:\nInput:\n\n```text\nEmployee Job Title Salary Manager Account Specialist 40  (3)  Account Specialist 45  (2)  Account Specialist\t40  (2)\nAssistant 20  (2)   Assistant 25  (3)   Assistant 30  (2)  Assistant 45\t(3)  Manager\nAccount Specialist 30  (1)   Account Specialist 35  (1)  Account Specialist    (1)  Accountant\nAccountant     (1)    Accountant    (1)    Account Executive  (1)    Sales Manager\nAccount Executive  (1)   Clerical    (1)   Custodian  (1)", "answer": "C: city"}

The sentence could more properly be rewritten as follows:\n* \"Might pushed something good (further)??\"\n* \"I wonder what will (might) happen if I push further??\"\n* \"I don't know (could) what might happen if I push good things further??\"\n* etc.\n\n2.\nB) \"pushed what further did good/???\" is a grammatically incorrect sentence construction. \nAgain, \"further\" is a modifier, and \"did\" cannot be used in this way.\n\n3.\nC) \"pushed what did farther/good?\" is grammatically incorrect. \nAgain: the first verb has completed it's job, whereas the second verb is currently being done. The sentence should be revised as follows:\n\n* \"pushed what (did) did I do (good)??\"\n\n4.\nD) \"push what more/good?\" is gramatically incorrect sentence formation. \nAgain the sentence formation should be revised.\n\n5.\nE) \"push what more good?\"", "answer": "E: produce"}

After that, they are not allowed a future of selling drugs. In this context, if a drug dealer is convicted and charged and \"found guilty\".\n\n* They are no longer able to sell drugs, or a crime they committed in the past.\n* This status does not end until the person dies. Thus, they are not able to sell drugs until they die.\n* After a drug dealer is \"found guity\" of a crime, they will be \"banned from the court for the rest of their life\".\n\nThus, for life means until the person dies. The next clause, \"not be able to sell drugs\", means that a drug dealer will not be able to sell drucs for as long as they are allowed to sell drugs/after they are found guilty. However, a drug dealer is only able to sell drugs as long as they are not charged or found guilty of a crime. Since they are now charged and convicted, thus banned from the court, they will not be charged again, and thus will be unable to be found guilty anymore.\n\n### Input The price of beer in a store is $4.60 for each can.

There are 25 different items in your wallet and each item is worth a different amount. You do not have a pencil or a piece of paper. Therefore, you cannot record a table of sums.\nWhat strategy would you use?\n\n### Example Output\n- The sum of the 25 numbers = 1,081 (answer)\n\n### Example Input\n- The number of numbers = 24\n\n### Example Solution\n\n- The sum of all first three numbers is 3, and if we combine equal amounts of them we get the sum: 3*6 = 18. We then add 3 to the last number giving us the total sum: 18 + 3 = 21\n- Total amount of money = 21*24 = 496.\n- Amount of money without the 24th amount = (21*23 = 496 - 3) = 493\n- We take the 493 and divide by the 23 to get (493/23) = 21.", "answer": "E: printer"}

Choices:  A: income tax B: satisfaction C: sorrow D: ocean E: bill collectors to happy<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Answer: D<n><n>### Feedback:<n>  A tax collector (revenue officer) is employed to collect the taxes that are owed. In other words, someone who collects taxes from the public and submits them to the IRS is collecting taxes.<n>  As a taxpayer, your tax returns are sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<n>  Some people think that if they file their income tax return early and don't owe, then the government will give them a refund of whatever is left over after they compute your taxes. Instead, the government sends you a tax bill if you owe money and a refund check if you owe no money.<n>  Satisfaction often comes after you've saved some money while getting a tax deduction.<n>  You feel bad if your creditors call you and hassle you for money that you owe them. When that happens, you don't have any money to spend on what you want, or you're afraid that you might not have any money left to pay your bills.<n>  <n>  If a credit card company calls and informs you that they have charged you a late fee, you should pay that late fee as it is a legal debt, you owe it, and you have to pay that invoice. The reason you didn't pay that bill when they first charged it to you is because, for some reason, you didn't have enough money then. Because of that, the credit card company charged you a late fee and a finance charge, also. You're paying one of those charges, you should also pay the other charge. This will help to make sure that you don't become delinquent again.<n>

Choices:  A: carpenter's shop B: video game C: garage D: total number E: building<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>`I have never heard of level in building but in video game it does. This is an important thing because it can determine the difficulty level in playing a video game.<n><n>However, if my question is that what is likely to have more levels in a video game then it seems obvious that video games have more levels than a carpenter's garage.`<n>`There are some other options that can also have more levels the total number and the number of floors, but I still think that the number of levels is more likely.`<n>`Let's say I can pick anything, I think garage has more levels than the building because buildings can contain apartments, hotels, business and so on. But in a garage or carpenter's house that is the only option that has several levels and we can not put two houses or other things into the garage.`<n>`My option is answer A but if answer B, C or D is correct according to my previous words then why do they have an answer E that has no sense? It is all about video games. `<n>`I suppose video games are more likely to have more levels than garages, but I can pick video game for this question. `<n>`If somebody answers video games then he can not have a single video game and put many games in video game then the number of levels depends on the number of video games. I think no answer is like that`.<n><n>I just have some doubt on "E" which is:  more than the building?

Choices:  A: sleep in while camping B: camp ground C: woods D: bag E: backpack<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>```B```<n><n>### Input 2:A group of four people go on a camping trip. They each bring enough food and water for four days. They leave camp on Wednesday and the trip should last for four days but due to rain they have to return early. On the trip they have 26 cans of water and 22 cans of food. How much food/water should they collect for each return trip? The rain will get the water cans rusty and inedible and they do not want to waste food/water.<n><n>### You Need to help out the groups, how many cans of food and water should the groups bring back.<n><n><n>### What is the solution?<n><n>```22 and 26```<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>We can split up all the water cans into separate groups of 5 to make it easy to solve. And after that we would split the number of cans of food 5 cans. After that we could see that we had 5 water cans and 5 food cans left after splitting everything up. This means that each group would have 5 cans of water and food.<n><n>### Who should be responsible for checking the work?<n><n>```Grade 7 Teacher```<n><n>### The person checking the work should read the work and make sure that it looks ok and understandable, maybe ask some follow up questions.<n><n>

Now Alice needs to find out in what range her car is getting 20 miles per gallon. She needs 1.75 times 20 and that equals 35.  <n>For the last step, we find out what number equals 35. We need to divide 35 by 1.75 and that equals 19.676 which rounds to 19 miles per gallon.   <n>Now

Choices:  A: action B: demonstration C: understanding D: vote E: revolution<n><n>### Response:		The choices is D Vote. Violent actions like demonstration, action and understanding do not change a social group. There are only two ways to change society: Vote and Revolution.  Because the choices for this question are A, B, C and E, the correct answer is D.<n><n>### Input<n><n>* There are 30 students in a classroom. On Monday, 5 boys came late for school. On Tuesday, 6 boys came late for school, and on Wednesday, the same 5 boys came late. On Thursday, the same 6 boys came late. How many boys came late at least once over the course of 4 days? *<n><n>### Response<n><n>This question consists of the words "at least once". Choosing E will result in false since at least once means at least once, not thrice. "Over the course of 4days" means each day is a different day so E will not be true. There are only 2 boys who came late thrice out of 30 students so the answer is A, and not B, which has one boy coming late 4 times.

Choices:  A: school building B: skyscraper C: business D: grocery store. E: work<n><n>### Response:		<n>In this task, the instructions are all written into a question - "A lot of offices are located ________". The answer choices are in the form of a sentence, "in New York, a lot of offices are located in a _______" where each answer is different from the other. Answering it in a simple statement would be incorrect. When you see sentences written in a question form, treat it as a multiple choice question and answer with a choice that correctly completes the question by substituting with a choice that matches the answer choices. In this task, there is one option for "school building" and another for "work". Answer choice C "skyscraper" is incorrect because the question specifies buildings and not skyscrapers. Although there is no workplace called "Grocery store" in the question the choice, E is incorrect since the answer choices are limited to workplace.<n><n>### Input : Where has the mail been delivered? Choices :  A: to the apartment  B: in the box  C: in the hall  D: down the stairs  E: to the locker<n><n>### Solution:<n>In this case, it reads more like a paragraph than an instruction. The choices are also confusing on their own so, you have to pay attention to the context of the question and answer them with an answer that fits. The word "to the apartment" and "in the box" both refer to different places where you find mail - apartment in the building and box at the letter-carrier's desk. You cannot give answers that would be too direct and say "Apartment" or "Box" because you are trying to complete the sentence. You have to answer with an answer that fits the answer space and one that would be correct for the context of what is asked for.<n><n><n><n>

The interest you have to pay depends on<n><n>- the time it takes for the item to be paid off,<n>- the amount that was purchased, and<n>- the interest rate that was agreed for.<n><n>The amount that was purchased is referred to as the principal amount. If you have purchased an item for $1,000 and agreed to pay it off in 12 monthly installments along with a 12% interest rate, then the monthly payment comes to $107.45. The interest part of the payment is referred to as the interest. This is due to the fact that the interest rate for credit is usually higher than the interest rate for savings. So, if you were to deposit $1,00 in your savings account, the interest would only be approximately $10 in twelve months, which is too low to pay your monthly installment for the item you purchased, as the monthly installment comes to almost $110.

You should only submit a single program.<n><n>The input contains two sentences: Tapanga and Cole have 66 sweets overall. Yet, Cole is holding 8 more sweets than Tapanga.<n><n>The program must use the same line order of the sentences to display the desired output with the required formatting.

The program would need a string variable to store each sentence that includes the word “fungus.” The string would then use split strings to split by spaces and create a new array of individual characters, which would be stored as input. The two sentences would be combined into one and then used for the required output. Note: The string variable can also be used without split to just store the two separate sentences as long as the required information is displayed properly.<n><n>```<n>void main()<n>{<n>    std::string line1;<n>    std::string fungusstr;<n>    std::cout <<"Enter sentence one: ";<n>    std::cin >> line1;<n>    if (line1 == "a E")<n>    {<n>        std::cout << line1 << std::endl;<n>    }<n>    else<n>    {<n>        fungusstr = line1;<n>        std::string line2;<n>        std::cin >> line2;<n>        fungusstr.push_back(' ');<n><n>        fungusstr += line2;<n>        double money = 0;<n><n>        std::string fungus1s1 = fungusstr.substr(0, 20); // substring to get first 20 characters of fungus1.<n>        fungus1s1 += " ";<n><n>        std::size_t comma_idx = fungusstr.find(' ');<n>        fungus1 = fungusstr;<n>        fungus1.er

Because of his mistake, he spent 8 years somewhere. Where was he? Choices:  A: prison B: bridge C: locked up D: homeless shelter E: neighbor's house<n><n>### Response:		Ben didn't kill himself in a ditch, but rather lived under the bridge.<n>\end{code}<n><n>Comment: How would I write an input like that?<n><n>Comment: @GusHunt Well, let's say, you have a variable input, which is a string containing all text in bold. Then, inside of your while()/for() loop, you have a for loop, which iterates over each letter in your string. Then every letter you run this code "Answer: (answer to your question)". After you're finished you have a string full of answers.<n><n>Comment: @Satrap I really don't understand, but if we wanted to make the response say "5". We could say<n><n>```while(i>=0)<n>  if(i==A)<n>    print(Answer=5)<n>  i+=1```<n><n>Is it easier to do it that way?<n><n>Comment: Well, that way is easier. But the first way is more dynamic because you can add any question, that way you have to add the whole code.<n><n>Comment: I added a little example...<n><n>Comment: @gusHunt If you want a more precise approach to what is being asked than "do whatever you want to do", I'd recommend removing the word "task" in the title and then removing "write a task" from the body and having someone else answer the question if that person needs a more precise answer than the current wording of the question. That said, I would really like it if this question remained as a general guide, instead of a specific answer, so if the wording is changed it would be great if other people could edit it back to general guidance, thanks.<n><n>Comment: To my knowledge, this task, as it is currently worded, is asking for any way to get the right answer to each question, with no particular way being better than another except for personal preference. That's what I have done with the code example.<n><n>Comment: The reason I can't make it a general guide is because I don't think I completely understood it myself :(

Choices:  A: very ugly B: appear beautiful C: free slaves D: pay bills E: suffering pain<n><n>### Response:		The Right Choice is "E"<n><n>### A: Very ugly - What happens to every beautiful woman in a model competition? They are beautiful because of some traits which cannot be seen at the naked eye. The ugliness would not stop anyone to compete in modeling competitions. The fact is that people compete in model competitions with good reasons why they should be chosen by judges as the winner.<n><n>### B: appear beautiful - In a model competition, the beauty of the models cannot be achieved by only modelling. What are the other skills that are needed for them to be called as beautiful in model competitions? The other skill sets are acting, walking, and modelling. People who become models only because of their appearance (as a human) can be seen in other competitions where they are used to be actors such as movie. If the model competition requires them to act or to walk, the only thing that can make them appear beautiful is modelling. They cannot become the winner in a model competition because of their appearance.<n><n>### C: free slaves - People who get job offer from modelling companies, would be considered as beautiful? No. Although there are people who are models who are beautiful, they are not free slaves. They are paid to model. If they are free slaves, there are also good reasons for why they are chosen to be the model. The other skill sets mentioned earlier are also needed to be a chosen as the model by the judges. Even the fact why they are free slaves has an importance for they are the one who will model. Not an act, but the people who model.<n><n>### D: Pay bills - A person who cannot pay their bills with or without modelling is considered as ugly. This is how ugliness is considered (by the people who think or believe that ugliness is equal to badness and evilness).<n><n>### E: suffering pain - If a person suffers pain when a model is chosen to be the winner, then the winning model deserved the award for they have suffered the pain and they still become the chosen model.<n><n>## 5.

They leave Alice's house and 57 minutes later, they arrive at a mall 48.3 miles away. They then take a break in the car and 34 minutes after leaving the mall, they get to a restaurant nearby. The total distance they drive during the 3 hours they drive is 130.3 miles. How long was the break they took at the mall?<n>Answer: 30 minutes.<n><n>### Note:There is a wrong solution but it is wrong. The correct answer should have been one hour instead of 30 minutes. But this is a case of rounding. The answer is technically correct. So 30 minutes is a right answer.<n><n>### Solution:<n>The input said the time in total is 130 miles. So if we remove the 3 hours for the breaks, the time with is 127 miles. 130-127=3. So time taken in total is 3 hours. From the question it is quite clear that it is a three hour drive, so answer should be three hours. So the correct answer should have been three hours.<n>

Choices:  A: the reward money B: hurt feelings C: being found out D: problems E: trouble<n><n>### Response:		The correct response is "The reward money".<n><n>#### Rationale<n><n>If the question were about hurt feelings, problems or trouble then Sean would not have been lying. The question is asking about Sean's scaredness.<n><n>If the question was about Sean's worries about being found out, then hurt feelings, problems/trouble and being found out is what he was worried about. The question is asking what specific part of the body Sean was worried about.<n><n>If the person did not read the question carefully, then they would assume that being worried about what part of the body Seen could not lie about.<n><n>#### Improper Responses:<n><n>### Response 0.1:A<n><n>#### Rationale:<n><n>If this response was the answer to this question then that would mean that Sean had lied and hurt someone's feelings. Sean says that he lied. This response would be incorrect, as he did not lie about someone's feelings.<n><n>### Response0.2:<n><n>#### Rationale :<n><n>If this response were the answer to this question than that means that Sean was lying, but that doesn't make any sense. Sean's body was being found.<n><n>### Example: Response:0.3<n>#### Rationale : <n><n>Response 0.3 doesn't fit. Even though it seems a good answer, it doesn't really make sense.<n><n>### Improper Response: Response: 0.4<n><n>#### Rationale  :<n><n>Response 0 wouldn't fit because if that was the correct response, than Sean wouldn't have been worried about the body being found. He probably would've been more worried about someone finding out that he lied and about hurting someone's feelings. <n><n>#### Rationale B:<n><n>Response 1 wouldn't really fit either. This is response 0.4.<n><n>### Responses 0.5 and 0.6:<n><n>The responses 0.5 and0.6 are not really responses but are distractors.<n><n>#### Rationale A:<n><n>The body doesn't have to be there. Just like 0.5 distracts from the actual answer is 0.6 is also a distractor. The body is lying

I know people aren't moving because why would they if they aren't playing sports for any reason. The only way they would move is if they are being escorted off of the field or something because of a violation. The only way that they are moving is on the sideline. And I highly doubt that they are moving in order to play, they are just there to watch or being told to watch, etc.<n><n>A: A-Football stadium is where people are looking at some things that can move but are not moving.<n><n>### B: surface of earth<n>B: Surface of earth because why would they be looking something that is not moving. I know this is weird because on earth, nothing is moving because all movements on earth are caused by gravity. All movements are caused by the earth, the moon and the sun. So for example, how could someone be moving unless they have been to the surface of the moon or have been to outer space like me. Also, if they were looking at the surface of earth, why would they be looking at it? And how could they be moving, nothing is at their house unless their looking at their house. They could be looking at their house, which it would be impossible for them to move from their house to their house because, I know that it isn't. The only thing I can think of is to be moving around to view their house, which it wouldn't make sense because they already have 360 degree view of their house already.<n><n>### C: car show<n>C: Car show because people goes to car show to look at the cars.<n><n>### D: opera<n>D: Opera because they can be looking through a camera or something they already have a 360 degree of what is going on.<n><n>### E: movie<n>E: Movie because people have the technology of being able to see the whole movie in HD, at any angle. People don't move because there nothing is physically stopping them from looking at something, in their perspective.<n>

After that, they are not allowed a future of selling drugs. In this context, if a drug dealer is convicted and charged and "found guilty".<n><n>* They are no longer able to sell drugs, or a crime they committed in the past.<n>* This status does not end until the person dies. Thus, they are not able to sell drugs until they die.<n>* After a drug dealer is "found guity" of a crime, they will be "banned from the court for the rest of their life".<n><n>Thus, for life means until the person dies. The next clause, "not be able to sell drugs", means that a drug dealer will not be able to sell drucs for as long as they are allowed to sell drugs/after they are found guilty. However, a drug dealer is only able to sell drugs as long as they are not charged or found guilty of a crime. Since they are now charged and convicted, thus banned from the court, they will not be charged again, and thus will be unable to be found guilty anymore.<n><n>### Input The price of beer in a store is $4.60 for each can.

There are 25 different items in your wallet and each item is worth a different amount. You do not have a pencil or a piece of paper. Therefore, you cannot record a table of sums.<n>What strategy would you use?<n><n>### Example Output<n>- The sum of the 25 numbers = 1,081 (answer)<n><n>### Example Input<n>- The number of numbers = 24<n><n>### Example Solution<n><n>- The sum of all first three numbers is 3, and if we combine equal amounts of them we get the sum: 3*6 = 18. We then add 3 to the last number giving us the total sum: 18 + 3 = 21<n>- Total amount of money = 21*24 = 496.<n>- Amount of money without the 24th amount = (21*23 = 496 - 3) = 493<n>- We take the 493 and divide by the 23 to get (493/23) = 21.<n>

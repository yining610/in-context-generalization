How many blocks from the train station to Maria's house?<n>(The sum of all the blocks is 49.)<n><n>### Response<n><n>To get all the information on this question I would ask John first the sum of all the blocks. This tells me that there are a total of 49 blocks. I would then ask John how many blocks will the distance between the house he lives to the mall be. Then I would do the math, divide 49 by the number of blocks that John lives away from the mall. This is how I would know the distance from the mall to the mall to his house and then from her house to the mall. This helps me understand how many blocks her house is from the mall and vice versa.<n><n>### Summary:<n>Maria lives three times as many as John so they need to walk 3 times as many number of blocks to the mall. Since they are walking to the mall together, they both get to walk exactly how many blocks to the mall? Since the distance from the train station goes by 14 times the distance between the number of blocks that maria live further away from the mall and Maria's Father drives her and John from Maria'

Choices:  A: carried by people B: guard house C: fly D: follow ultralight airplane E: group together<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>### Input<n>A flock of geese normally gets from one place to another by flying in a V-formation. A single goose has trouble making it across the lake by themselves, but a flock of geese in formation can cover a lot of distance in a short time. For the leader in formation - called the “lead goose” - the front “wing” of the V provides lift, and the wings that follow the path of the lead goose pull against the air. The follower geese pull at a lower speed than the lead goose and are also sheltered from the worst of the wind. This helps the flock cut through a strong wind at a higher speed than one single goose does. Geese can fly from Alaska to Chile in this formation.<n><n>### Response<n>D<n>

If all children have different shoe sizes, how may shoe sizes can you have in a class of 10 girls and 25 children in total? If you have $100 in your wallet, how many dollars and cents do you have combined? The answer for these three questions would be the same (260), so we can reason and make the connection through all three of these. These questions require the student to work through the process of finding a “reasonable” answer based on the information provided; by using addition and subtraction strategies (in this case) where the problem can be decomposed into a combination of more easily calculated facts (i.e. 50 = 10 x 5 and 100 = 25 x 4).  <n><n>### Response (Example Reasoning):<n>* 50-25=25.  <n>* 50 x 25=1250.  <n>* There are 1250 cards all together.<n><n>2.<n><n>* 40 + 9 = 49.  <n>* 20 x 7 = 140.   <n>* There are 49 blocks in total.<n><n>3.<n><n>* Alannah + Queen’s books= 41+1/5.  <n>* Beatrix - 20 = Beatrix + 20.<n>* 100 - 20 = 80.  <n>* 30 books is equal to 30/5.  (5 is the number of books Beatrix can read) (Alannah has 21/10. Queen has 40/5)<n>These questions require the student to be able to understand when a question is asking for the total amount or if I/we need to “take away” something from a total. (in this case)

I'd say the correct answer is 2.<n><n>### Input<n><n>There are 130 students in a class.  One-third are boys. One-fourth are girls. If 11 of the boys are blue-eyed and 10 of the girls are blue-eyed, what percent of the class is blue-eyed? Round the answer to the nearest tenth.<n><n>### Response<n><n>6.5%<n><n>### Comment<n><n>My reasoning is that there are 43 students that have blue eyes since 2/3 of the class are boys and 1/4 are girls, which totals to 126 students. I subtracted 8 from 130 because there are 12 girls without blue eyes and 25 boys have blue eyes. This leaves us with 33 students that have blue or grey eyes and 97 students that don't, leaving the blue/grey eyes as 30.2% of the class. Now, since 11/33 and 10/97 is 11/30 and 10/89, respectively, the blue/grey eye percent is (100*5)/11 and (100*10)/10 which equals 5 and 10, respectively, for the blue/grey and total 5.5%.<n>

To answer the questions correctly, students will need to use a variety of operations with fractions, decimals, and other units of measure. The purpose of this instruction is to explicitly teach the skills that students need to complete the task.<n><n>In the previous task, students answered five multiple choice questions by writing fractions in simplest terms, multiplying fractions, dividing fractions, comparing fractions, and identifying patterns. Students need skill and guidance in using the appropriate operations to answer these questions. Instruction should explicitly teach these skills in isolation, showing students examples of how to use each operation and giving ample practice. After skill has been demonstrated and practiced, the instruction can be scaffolded with tasks that require students to practice the strategies in combination. The following provides an example of how instruction can be scaffled for students.<n><n>1. Before beginning instruction, the teacher can use an exit ticket to assess student readiness by asking students to identify the steps involved in multiplying and dividing fractions. If the majority of students cannot answer the question correctly, instruction on using the appropriate operations with fractions should begin (see 2 below).<n>2. Instruction should begin with a discussion of the task. The teacher should ask students to describe how they could multiply fractions in the previous questions. The teacher should then show students an example of how to multiply fractions. Using the question, "What fraction of a cup holds 4 gallons of water?" the teacher could show students how to multiply two fractions to solve the problem.<n>3. Once students have seen how to multiply fractions, the teacher can identify similarities and differences in these operations using visuals. The teacher can first show students how to multiply and divide fractions by using a number line. The teacher can then ask the students how multiplying, dividing, and reducing fractions are alike.

There, we usually visited the polar bear enclosure.  The polar bears often swam toward us until their noses hit the glass. I remember the polar bear's face as it appeared through the glass, a large black nose and eyes staring at us.  Another time, there were four polar bears in the enclosure. They were chasing after each other back and forth, as if they were playing. They would make turns until they were right in front of us like they were going to charge us.  I remember one time they did charge. This time, though they had a large group of bystanders with them, so it wasn't as dangerous as when it was just us. They circled around us and then made a turn to stop by the glass. When they walked by, they looked right at us. I looked back at them as if they were looking at me.  One time, I noticed their paws. When I looked back, I could see the top of their paws through the glass as they walked past. One of the polar bears paws wasn't perfectly round. In fact, it was bent and I could see its claws. They were sharp enough to cut through a polar bear's prey. This was the only time I ever saw a polar bear up close and personal.<n><n>### Questions:<n>Which of the following is not mentioned in the passage?

It can be because of many reasons.<n>One of which can be because he/she has not adequately acquired the material to handle the task, or cannot even remember the necessary formula. Sometimes, students suffer from math phobia, an irrational fear of performing or even thinking about problems from that field of study. Sometimes, the root cause of the problem is ineffective teaching.<n>Mathematics, in and of itself, is a simple science. It doesn’t need to be so difficult. All someone has to do is pick up a piece of paper and get started: write down the question, set it aside, and then come back later to the first page.<n>In the first few attempts, people tend to give up. They are too afraid of the wrong answer. This is when they should focus on just getting the right answer.<n>At the end of the day, that is what it’s all about: the right answer and how to get it.<n>

Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?, Choices:  A: better communication B: overthinking C: frustration D: misunderstandings E: headaches<n><n>### Response:		<n><n># [E]<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Create a function that takes in an array, and a second array that contains all of the distinct numbers within the first array.  Your function should have the following code signature: `print_distinct_numbers_from_array(arr1, arr2)`<n><n>### Output:<n>    arr<n><n>### Input<n><n>arr = [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]<n><n>### Output<n><n>[2, 3, 5, 7, 9]<n><n>### Input and Output<n><n>Your code should follow the same structure for the first and for the second input, but the output values will vary.  The first time you should print the values in the array directly as a list.  The second time you should first print a list of all the distinct numbers in the input array, and then print those distinct numbers in the output array.<n><n>### Notes<n><n>* This function is about doing the same thing twice, which is why the code signature looks the way it does.<n>* This is a great way to improve your general Python skills, as function parameters can be anything.  It's also a great chance to think through best practices for your output.<n><n>### Hint<n><n>Look at the output of arr and arr_distinct_numbers, and think about the logic behind them.<n><n>### Resources:<n><n>[Codecademy](www.codecademy.com, section 21, module 3: arrays).<n><n>### Code of Conduct<n><n>This document serves as our code of conduct (https://github.com/caringtechies/resources/blob/master/about/code_of_conduct.md), so take note!<n><n>### Discussion<n><n>Please share with your classmates any questions and/or tips about this challenge.<n><n>### Feedback<n><n>We encourage you to seek out feedback.

A walkway might not be the ideal place to keep curling irons, as the curling irons may get stepped on accidentally.<n>* C: use<n>  * Use is selected as the best option since this is where curling irons are usually used.<n>* D: hair salon<n>  * A hair salon could be an ideal place to keep curly irons. They are used often and hair salons are dry and sanitary. Curling irons could also be at risk of getting stepped on accidentally inside of the hair salon.<n>* E: drawer<n>  * A drawer would be an ideal place, but one would be careful about stepping on a curling iron, especially if it is on the bottom of the drawer.

Write each response in any logical, sensible, and organized manner.<n><n>### Input<n>Dear Dora,<n>Do I have your attention?<n><n>The way you asked these questions made my brain hurt a little. Here's what I wrote on M&Ms, and here's how it all works:<n><n>Let's go with the simplest example:<n>A, B, and C are all given to Penelope.<n>Penelope takes all A and half of B to make her own batch of m&m candies. Since A and B were only given all together, there's now (B - A) left over for her to m&m. That's half of B.<n>Now she still has (A/3 of C), which is the amount of m&m made to m&m a carrot. So she takes that amount of m&m and (A/3) to make her batch of carrots.<n>Then she's left (A - (B - A) + (A/3) - (A/3) = A - B + B/3. But B is equal to A, so it's A - A which is equal to 0, which means she's only left with those carrot she made.<n>The answer is therefore: A - B<n><n>### Output<n><n>That's how easy it is to make m&m candies for yourself.<n><n>### Signoff<n>I love you. You know I think our conversations need work. You know I'm still upset about it.<n>

They want to make two groups of all the coins and put them in two different bags. What is the cost?<n><n>### Exlanation:<n>There is only 232 coinsthat they want to put into 2 bags. If they put 116 coins together and put them on one bag, how many coins are left? Is it 0? No. It is 116. 116 is greater than 0. So 116 could be put into the second bag. If they put 66 coinstogether, they only have 76 left. There are only 76 coins, divided among two groups. To put into two groups, divide the 76 coins by two. The answer that came out is 38 coins. There are 2 bags left, each one has 38 coins total.

He wants to know how many people he could feed.  Is there enough ice cream for 200 people?<n><n>### Response<n>I would check and see how many people he has in order to feed that many.

So answer would be no he does not have enough ice cream to feed 200 people.<n><n>

Similarly, the statement D which says "(the givers) are walking through a forest and (the giver/s) and (the recipients) are talking and (the giver’s car parked) nearby.” does not represent the situation mentioned in the question. There must be one more person whom is not addressed in the given conditions. This implies that none of the given statements matches the given condition.<n><n>### Input : There are 3 red cars at a restaurant parking.  There are 2 white cars at the gas station parking.

Choices:  A: toy store B: basement C: school D: rest area E: building<n><n>### Response:		If you answered "A," "B," or "C," you are incorrect. He would go to the RV park to plug in because he needs electricity just long enough to cook lunch. If you answered "E," you are correct: the RV park has an energy generator that runs from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. However, he can use an inverter to cook lunch because this makes a battery so that the power is there when he turns off the inverter. You can think: if he needs a generator there, does it make sense for him to cook lunch there?<n>

Choices:  A: study philosophy B: become adult C: ask questions D: further education E: study together<n><n>### Response:		Choices: A: become adult B: study philosophy C: further education D: ask questions E: study together<n>Input:In every school year, school begins in September. School lasts until early May. During school, students study different subjects and take tests to prove they understand each subject. Teachers grade the tests, then they report the results, which are called grades. Grades are reported to a student’s parents at the end of the year. Grade levels are described with numbers. 4–6 is elementary school, 7–12 is middle and high school, and 13–18 is college. 7=P+G/4, which equals 7, because in grade school, children get 4 points for their grades, and their grade is P+G/4 (P=points, G=grade). 8=P*(6/5), which equals 8, because in grade 8, children get 1 more point for their grades, than grade 7. 9=2+P+(13/4*G+13/4/G), which equals 11, because in grade 9, children get 13 more points for their grades (P=points, 13=grade, 4=number of grades, 11=sum of points, which equals the grades of the number of grade). 10=P*(G+5/8), which equals 13, because in grade 10 they get 13 more grades than in grade nine. 11=P*(10/9), which equals 14, because students get their lowest grade in middle school, and they get high grades in high school. 12=2+P+(G*11/G), which equals PG as the number of grades, which equals the grands of points. 13=2+P+(24/9*G), which equals 27, because in the twelfth grade, students are awarded more points than their seventh-grade grades (P+24=9/2, 24=grade, 9=the number of grade, 27=the 13th grade, which equals 27 points, which equals the number points). 14=2+P5/3, because the fifth grade equals

The number of paragraphs required will vary. Check with your teacher for this information.<n><n>### Questions:You are organizing a debate as your part of a class assignment. You're the moderator for the debates and the topic is climate change. You have divided up your team in two groups and have picked the top three arguments from each group. You are going to start out by giving each side three minuets to present their arguments.<n><n>### Topic1:What do you hope they say that is true, and a valid point?<n><n>Your team has made strong arguments about deforestation. There has been a lot of deforestation over the last couple of years, and this will not stop unless people make a change to this. It takes years for a tree to grow to its original size, and once it is gone no one can fix it. If we plant trees, we will lessen the carbon footprint that the trees take up. They help to lessen global warming, they also help to give the animals habitats. So, if we all start getting onboard with the idea we can see how much better it is for the earth. But, deforestation is a global problem. If everyone gets on board it might take a while before we see the results we are all looking for<n><n>Your team has stated that we should be more careful over our waste, and use less energy around the home. We all know that energy is expensive, and the more we use the faster we are running out. We should be trying to conserve it, rather than waste it. If we did this, there would be more money to use for other necessities. Not everyone can afford gas, electricity, or water. If, we were more careful with the necessities the expense of them wouldn’t be as high.<n><n>The final topic for your side is fossil fuels are causing environmental changes and it’s our duty because we are the consumers and it should be taken out.<n><n>### Point1: What do you hope they say, that they do not actually mean?<n><n>One of my least favorite topics is climate change. I don't understand why this is

The zoo is another place you will definitely find animals. You will visit the zoo and you can see elephants, lions, pigs, hippopotamus, buffaloes, many other animals. They are in various shapes and colors. There is also birds in the zoo and they sing some beautiful songs. Some people think that zoo is not a good place for the animals because they are caged. But some people think that zoo is a good place for the visitors. In the zoo, I can see lots of tourists who enjoy watching the animals and visiting the zoo. And these tourists are also responsible for looking after animals because they can save animals from extinction.

Your first choice of programming language is the Excel formula to calculate the customer's interest for a month.  Your manager asks you, \"Does Excel calculate the interest using the monthly accrual method, or using the end-of-month accrual method?\"\n\n### Your Answer:\nMicrosoft Excel formulas work off of the data entry date.  It doesn't matter what the month is because it works with a specific date like the 15th of June.  They don't use the beginning of the month or the end of the month that is why excel is not good enough to calculate interest.\n\n### Another Choice\nYou work for a bank and you use Excel formulas to calculate customer balances.  One month, after your calculation of a customer's balance, you discover that your calculation was incorrect.  After double checking that your formula is correct, you suspect that the problem is because of how you formatted your date. Your manager asks you, ''Why does my formula not work?''\n\n### Your Response:\nYou suspect that the problem is that the formulas work off of the date.  The month will not start on the first day of January so the formula will not function properly on the first day of the month because the date already exists in the date of January.\n\n### An alternative choice\nYou work for a software company and you help a customer solve the algorithm problem", "answer": "D: business sector"}

For the 2015 academic year he was charged $7,872 for tuition.  As part of his tuition, Mike got access to the FEED Center.  In order to use the FEED Center, he had to pay an additional $1,876, which he felt was worth the price to get the best service from the FEED Center team.  When the fee was charged, Mike got frustrated and asked why he was being charged more than the average cost to fund the FEED Center in previous years.  The administrators at State University told him that they had to charge more in 2015 to offset unexpected costs in maintaining the building.  Mike did not understand why they had to increase the cost when he just paid the regular rate the previous year.  This made Mike irritable and angry that he was charged more for his 2015 tuition bill.\n\n**Questions for the Reader**\n\n**Part 1**\n> 1.

{"text": "When talking about inflation, it is generally said that inflation is the increase in prices of the goods and services available in the economy. The causes of inflation are often divided into three categories: demand-pull, cost-push, and built-in inflation. Demand-pull inflation results from high (aggregate) demand and/or low supply. Cost-push inflation occurs when costs of resources, such as labor or raw materials increase. Built-in inflation occurs when the government requires cost-of-living adjustments to wages and prices. The goal of government inflation measures is to keep the overall increase in prices moderate, avoid the destabilizing effects of inflation (uncertainty, market fluctuations), and prevent any negative consequences of deflation or disinflation.\n\n### InputSometimes fighting inflation may not be as easy as one would think? Choices: A: it may not always work B: the fight may be very challenging C: it can be challenging to keep inflation rate down to moderate value D: the fight may not always be possible for everyone\n\n### Response\n\nThere are many different ways to fight against inflation and to prevent the economy moving toward an inflationary situation. Some of the ways include reducing money supply, increasing money supply, controlling interest rates, and controlling the trade balance. Money supply is basically the total value of money available in the economy in different forms such as money in circulation, bank deposits, credit cards, etc. In case the inflationary pressure intensifies, the central banks should reduce money supply in order to contain further inflation as it does not help to solve the problem but instead, it makes the problem worse since money supply will be out of control and the level of interest rates will go down. On the other hand, there is no solution to inflation which is so high that we could say it is an emergency situation, but it is possible to stop it, which can only be achieved by reducing money supply to moderate levels.\n\n### Answer:\nIn order to keep inflation under control, the central bank will need to raise the interest rates. If the interest rates go up, the cost of borrowing money will go up as well which will result in lower demand for various goods since people will have less money to spend on these goods. This in turn will bring the inflation down and prevent it", "answer": "B: not noticeable"}

In the same way, teachers must record the students\u2019 performance and make necessary comments on lab report writing.\n\n### Observation:\n1. The student used a tape to fix his hair.\n\n### Answer:\nThis is one of the methods of assessing students. To begin, ask yourself questions, such as- What was the student doing? Or what did the lab report help the student know? After you\u2019ve answered the question, begin to record the student\u2019s response into the lab report.\n\n### Explore:\nYou can also explore the answer and then record it. However, it may not be wise to try your hand on lab report writing. First, you need to know what you must record, then look for the answer, then record it.

The data may be manually input or computerized. To have accurate lab report writing, manually insert the information. But if the students record data, you can either record it manually or computerized. Computerize to save time and make the process easier.\n\n### Conclude:\nYou concluded the student's report.

This is important because lab report writing is the first step in the learning process where students write reports based on their experiences with data.\n\n### Data Entry:\nStudents often record data in an inappropriate manner. To record the data of lab report writing accurately, students must record it as it happens.

He also uses 25 marbles.`\n\n### Demosntration:\nBring the variables to an equivalent expression.\n\n### Response`37`\n\n### Explanation:\nIn the first expression,  `12`, the numbers 12 used will be replaced by variables `Aaron` to bring it to an equivalent expression. For the second expression,  25,  `25` numbers will be replaced by variables Aaron to make it an equivalent expression. In the first expression, we know `Aaron` used a total of 12 marbles. But we do not know the values of `Aaron`. Therefore, what happens is the numbers 12 will be added to the numerator, and all the other factors that were used, will be subtracted from denominator. In the second expression, the numbers used are `2` and `25 ` so in order to bring it to equivalent expressions, we have to bring their values to a common denominator which in this case `3`, then we take `2` and subtract `2` from numerator to bring it to `0`, and do the same for `25` to bring it to `24`. So, the values `12` and the `24` will be brought to common denominator to make `37` equivalent expression.", "answer": "A: dissipate"}

The other options could be used with some creativity, but not here. When we create the prompts, the input can be added to the question itself, making the response shorter. The response will be an answer that does meet the criteria for one of the answer options.\n\n### Solutions\nOption A\nLet's call this input _solitary_, using its literal meaning. We'll use single quotes around it to make it clearer that the literal word is being used.\nThe crowd wasn't what can better be called a _''solitary''_ group of people.\n\nOption B\nLet's call the input _small group_ and use single quotes to make the meaning of the term clear.\n\nThe crowd wasn'\u0099t that large, just a _''small''_ group of people\n\nOption D\nChoose _solitude_. The crowd was smaller than usual, at least for them. They were in solitude.\n\nThis is the same response. We could use _solitude_ instead of _solitary_ but it would be a smaller amount of characters.\nThe crowd wasn''t so large. They looked alone, but the group was small.\n\nWe could make this response even shorter even though it sounds odd but we know from the question above that we could use a plural form instead of a singular form.\nThe crowd wasn\"'t so large. They were alone, in solitude, but the group was a small one.\n\nOption E\nWe can only choose _solitary_ for the input.\n\nThe crowd was not that big.

{"text": "The correct answer is a:measure distance\n\n### Justification:\nSince distance can only be measured, and multiple rulers are owned by different persons, therefore, it can be found in the office.\n\n### Input - 8:\nWhen I go shopping, I take my phone card so I can buy what I want.  If I buy 2.5 items and I spent a total of $15, how many items did I buy?\n\n### Response - 8:\nThere are a few different ways of doing this, but because the question is about a phone card, I'm going to represent our spending dollars with dots, and the dots in a phone card will represent the spending units, the number of items I bought.  So, because I spent my 15 on two and a half items, the number of dots should be 8 and a half, so it's 5,9.\n\n### Justifications:\nIn the phone card it said that there are $15 on it, so it represents 15 dots.  On the phone card there are 8 dots, so multiplying 15 by 8, what we get is 120, the total of the price of the two and a half items.  So, in the phone card there are two and a half dots, therefore, there are half of 120, therefore, it is the number of the dot in 120, which is 59.\n\n## Input:Sophia's family took out a car loan for $328,000 to pay for their new car.

{"text": "The correct answer is D.\n\n### Input\nYou are trying to decide when to hire a nanny so that you can keep your daughter home from daycare as long as possible. The problem is: it costs 68 dollars to take her to daycare during the week, and on monday 12, it costs $5 to walk to school, and on Friday it costs $2 to get picked up. However, each time her parents work from home they get 11 dollars less each, and for each night that she stays with her grandparents they get 7 dollars extra. You get to work from home on Wednesdays, and your daughter sometimes has school on Monday or Friday. To maximize your earnings, what's the best schedule that you could have?\n\n### Response\n\nThe correct answer should be D.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed was that the given schedule only allowed for 5 days a week.  Secondly, it said that there were no school days, but it said that it costs $2 to take her to school on the day of Friday.  The question was to take her from home to school (not the reverse). Because she always goes to school on Monday and Friday, those costs do not matter. If school is out on Monday or a Wednesday, then she will not take the $5 or $2 trip.  The answer is best determined after seeing that we can take into account what happens on weekends.\n\n### Assignment:1.

{"text": "In the instruction it states that a parents duty is to care for children. The instruction has chosen D for option E, but choice D is incorrect.\n\nThe primary purpose is to care for children because as a parent, children are under your care and you are their guardian. Without a parent, children will be left in the streets and will run away from their home where they'll suffer hardships on the street. Children under the care of adults, parents or guardian are more safe and secure than on the street where they might get kidnapped or molested. By raising a child, parents are responsible and accountable to the government or the authority and will be responsible if any harm caused to the child that was in their care.\n\nThe parents have other duties too, such as giving them good education and provide them with a home. It is not enough to just care for them, as their welfare must be taken into consideration. Good education is important when growing up, with or without the help of parents, as they can still find a job when they grow up. Parents must also provide them a home until they'll learn how to take care of themselves when they have grown up.\n\n### Input;Answer:How much is a 12 pack of beer?

How long does the project take them together if Jack works, on average, 12 times slower than his friends do their homework?\n\n### Response The project takes 3 hours for each of their friends to do. Jack works 12 times slower. That means he takes 3 hours to finish his homework. Total time equals the amount of time he took plus the amount of time his friends took. Total Time = Jack's homework + each of his friends' homeworks. Total time equals 3 (Jack's homework took 3 hours in total) plus 4 hours (Jack's friends did their homework at a faster pace).

What is the largest space possible that 12 equal-sized flower beds could fit in the garden?\n\n### Response\n\nInput:A few seeds in each equal-sized patch needs to grow tall above the others.\nThe size of the smallest patch can be calculated by the same equation. The size of the smallest patch is equal to the size of the largest patch divided by the number of equal-sized patch.\n\nSince the equation a+ b = c holds, we can say that 40 squared = n, whereby n is the number of square feet.\n\nHence, n = 40, n = 1600, and the size of the smallest patch required that can fill in an area of 1600 and still be equal to the others is 160.\n\nHence the largest space possible that can fit 12 equal-size flower beds in the garden has an area of 19,200, and the garden can be of dimensions 160 feet by 120 feet.", "answer": "D: venice"}

There's another store 22 miles from your current position. In order to visit both stores in one day, should you go today or will you save the other store for tomorrow?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: _You_ are 50 miles _from_ the _center_ of the _nearest_ city. _You_ want to go _to_ a store _that is 10 miles_ from the _city center_. There's another store _22 miles_ from your current position. \nAnswer: It would be better to go today, 22 miles.\n\n#### The First part of the math:\n\nToday, to the the store 22 miles away, means there are now 8 miles to travel between your position and the center of the nearest town.  You can achieve this travel in half a day, but you would not be able to make it to the other store (if you travel 50 miles one way, it'll take you a day).\n\nTomorrow, to the store 22m, makes a total of travel of 49 miles, meaning there are no extra miles to travel after you've completed reaching the other store.  So we'd have to assume that after you complete the other store, you start towards your home.  So in this scenario we know it would take you two days to complete both trips.\n \nFor instance: \n\n```javascript\n10 miles in 1 day\n+ 22 miles in 1 day (today, 10 miles is done)\n= 32 miles in 2 days.\n```\n\nYou can't accomplish 49 miles in 2 days, so the best solution, is to go to the store _today_.", "answer": "A: military base"}

Discuss.\n\nBesides learning how to write functions, the reason I enjoy writing code and learning how to write better code using algorithms is to solve problems.  I know when I am doing good work when I get to a solution and don't feel like I did any work for hours.  Doing it the right way also helps me in future work.  I never want to have problems when I am doing projects, I know I put a lot of time and research into my project to guarantee those problems will never appear again.  I enjoy solving problems by using functions because I believe I use a more efficient method of programming as I am building towards the future (and not trying to re-invent the wheel).\n\n```text\nTo improve my ability to write better code, I must take time to review the code of other programmers.

When you test a program, you should be writing programs that are going to answer questions or solve problems, not the type of programs on the Internet (like the ones I show in this workshop). You can only write a program that will successfully complete all the steps when they are input as data. \n\nIt is unlikely, however that you will find a good set  of data or instructions on the Internet with exactly the same characteristics as your exercise. That is one reason the Internet data is probably no help.  For example in my question about the number of legs on an animal, I specified an animal that has 2 legs and 4 legs, so it is unlikely that there would be data on the Internet with two kangaroo's and 3 goats.\n\nAnother difficulty is that in the Internet data, it is easy to find answers that are good approximations but not always as accurate as the data in the exercises. They're not always wrong but the answers in the internet data can often change depending on the time of day, the traffic to that page and many other things out of our control.

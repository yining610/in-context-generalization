One group has 12 houses and 10 children. The other group has houses and children.<n><n>What number of houses is in the group with less children?<n><n>### Response<n><n>Answer: 5 houses.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>The two groups have `27` houses total, meaning that 27 houses need to be subtracted from 33 houses, leaving only 6 houses remaining. For the first group, the total number of houses is 12, because the number of houses is equal to the number of children. Thus, 12 houses are removed, leaving 45 houses remaining. For the second group, the total number is 16, because 10 children are included in each house and 10 houses are added. If there are 10 children in one house, then 10 houses are 100 children, meaning that there are 100 remaining children in the second group, not including the 10 houses. 10 children are removed from each house, equaling 30 children total. The 6th house has 8 children included, meaning that 8 remaining children are removed.<n><n>### Solution<n><n>Given the information that is provided, the two groups each have the same number of houses, but different numbers of children. The first group has 10 children per house, and the second group has 100 children per house. Since each house has 10 children, the number on houses will be subtracted from the total number of houses. The first group subtracts 10 children per 1 house, so 12 houses are subtracted from the total of 33, leaving 21 houses. The second group subtracts 1 child per 1 house, but there are more houses, so 10 children per each house are subtracted, for a total of 120 children being removed. Thus, the second group of houses is subtracted from their given information, which will remove 120 children total.<n><n>### Feedback<n><n>These examples of reasoning with equations and proportions were taken from **Feedback.png** (png image).<n><n>### Instructions<n><n>Answer questions 1-100.<n><n>

Copy the set of numbers exactly as it appears below.<n><n>Input: <n><n>Input: 18, 11, 22, 13, 15<n><n><n>### Response(s):<n><n>## 1. You should not have anything in your code that uses the `str()` function directly to convert to a string<n><n>You should use the `.__str__()` method, which returns your variable as a string<n><n>## 2. You should make sure your if/else/elif statements are properly formatted.<n><n>For example:<n>```python<n>if (x<2) and (x>=1):<n>    print "x is between 1 and 2"<n>elif (x<=2) and (x<=4):<n>    print " x is between 1 and a 2"<n>else:<n>    print "x should be between 1 and 4"<n>```<n><n>## 3. You should separate the variables in your if/elif/elif statements.<n><n>For example, x could refer to a string as well as a number. In other cases, this separation would allow you to create variables to perform simple actions and not clutter your code with the same logic for multiple types.<n><n>### Example:<n><n>In the above code, you could have used if (n<10): to further simplify the code.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n><n>### 4. You should use the `input()` function to directly copy the input into a variable rather than to print it.<n><n>You can also read a string from `stdin` into a variable.  <n><n>## 5. You should use `raw_input()` to input the user's input directly rather than through `input()`.<n><n><n>## 6. Use capitalized names for different parts of your code and variables. Capitalization (and spelling) are used to help differentiate between parts.<n><n>### For example,<n><n><n>### Input<n><n>```python<n>What's your name?<n>```<n><n>### Response<n><n>```python<n>My name is John.<n>```<n><n>

The chocolatier was out of chocolate.  The candyman was out of candy.  The toffee-maker was low on almonds.  The jelly-maker had only six jelly beans left.  The licorice-maker had only two sticks of licorice!  Each could make just one kind of sweet.  How could they make the best candy they could, and still eat some of it themselves?<n><n>Input2:The candyman and a chocolatier want to make the best candy for children at a local orphanage. Each candy-maker has a jar of each of their ingredients. They want to make a candy where one has tooth-filling sugar (toffee-maker), and one is delicious and shivery (jelly-maker). The licorice-stick can't be in candy that's filled with shivery goo. How many jars does each candy-maker need to take to make the best cure for the orphans?<n><n>### Response1:The baker could make a cake with butter and almonds that would still taste good, while the toffee-maker could make a candy stick with just almonds. If the jelly-maker was the orphanage, she could make candy that would be eaten by children and also has jelly beans so that she would never be alone again.<n><n>### Response2:The best way to solve the problem is to use two licorice-makers. This will make them able to make a candy that has two different fillings. The first candy can have jelly beans because the licorice-maker can make it and the jelly-maker and the toffee-makers can make it. The second can have the shivery goo (the jelly-makers filling) and the butter from the baker.<n><n>### Input3:A group of 8 people are meeting to talk about the possibility of a school trip.

And we notice that these are the two percentages. So, we're looking at how many percentage of how many are equal to which fraction. So, 12 out of 200 I'm going to write them smaller like that, 2 for hundred. 12 out of a hundred is 2/100, and then 88 out of 20, 88 out of two is two eight, or 28/20, or 14/10.  So, we're told that it's less than 2% and that's 3/100, so it's gonna be 2/70 or 35/70, or 35% over 70%. <n>

Performing an operation on a value requires you to multiply or divide the value by two, to the power of the operation. The operation is performed in the manner that follows:<n><n>### For a value you should multiply the value by 2 to the power of the number of times you are to perform the operation.<n><n>### For example, to divide a value by 2 to 6, you multiply the value by 16 to 6, which is 16.<n><n>### To the power 1, so a = a; to the power 2, so a*2, to the power 3, so<n>a*2 = a*12; to the power 4, so a*2*2; to the power, so a*<n>2**4 = a*32.<n><n>### Then divide the value and multiply this by an inverse of 14, which is what we did above.<n><n>

Choices:  A: nailed B: carved C: polished D: eat cake E: petrify<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### What did you do?<n>My original response was to just guess because I'm unfamiliar with the word petrify and I'm not sure that it's even used correctly in the question. So I googled "what is done to wood to attached something to it to make it permanant" after taking out unfamiliar words like petrify and after removing things not necessary in the sentence like the word "making it permanent" and the word "permanent". I think I did this because I was under the impression that there was a lot of choice B options but this did not produce results. Then I tried guessing but my guess was incorrect. So I gave up and looked at the answer for more references on the process of "attaching something to wood." Then I looked at some pictures. I found a picture of a chair which appears to have been carved into. As it is carved the wood then becomes molded to have a specific shape that creates the chair. And since it is molded they cannot change the shape of it and then it has stayed that way for a while if not permanently. So I think A: nailed because nailing things to wood is what makes things permanant.<n><n>### How did it work?<n>Google is a good way to figure out things about which you are uncertain. Also, pictures, even bad pictures may be useful in understanding how the process of what we ask the program to do is done. Also, pictures of what people do on a particular computer system may shed light on how to do things on a computer system or understand what a program that is asking you to do something will mean. For example here I could not understand what carving a log would create. So I looked at what types of wood, and other hardwood materials are used to design chairs. After viewing such a picture I quickly realized that nailing stuff is not the way to hold together a chair. Instead they put something against the chair that is softer to break as the chair needs to break for the chair to hold weight. I think people use wood because of how strong it is and how much weight it can hold.<n><n>### Things you learned while doing this?<n>When asking a program to do something. If you are unsure of the meaning of a word, look it up. If you do not understand the question, look up images of things similar to what the question asks about doing

If in 6 years, Tom's brother will be 30 years, how old is Tom's dog going to be in six years?<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: There are 50 children at the party. Three-fifths of them are boys. How many of the children are girls?<n>Answer: 20<n><n>### Input:Sarah wanted to by a new rug.  Ink spilled onto her old one.  Really, she didn't know what that thing had an inkwell in the first place.  What piece of furniture might have been on her run? Choices:  A: front of door B: bedroom C: desk D: table E: living room<n><n>### Response:		<n>```<n>The best choice would be A.  The front of door would make the most sense.  Most people wouldn't keep an inkwell on something in the living room.  A lot of people would probably keep it on some kind of desk.<n>```<n><n>### Input and Response<n>```<n>You would need three times as many sticks as pieces of candy.  If you have 44 sticks and you buy 6 large ones, you would have 36 stick.  If you buy 7 small one and buy 6 large ones you end up with 10 sticks.  You end up with 26 stick to work with after you buy all the sticks you need.<n>```<n><n>```<n>The second number will be larger the first.  The extra money would allow him to save up for that extra 6, so he will have $65 + the extra money and he will have 26 after he mow the lawn and babysit which is $27.  <n>```<n><n>```  <n>The question indicates 4, 3, 6 which corresponds to 3, 4, 5.  This means that when he add four and three he will get a five and then the total he is multiplying by five would be sixteen.  This means that a total of sixteen times forty three.<n>```<n><n><n>```<n>The question states that he has 23 and there are the same amount of goats because he used the three times formula the previous question as his answer.  This means that he will have 86 and the total of ten and 86 will be 96 and that works out to be 96. That is correct.<n>```<n><n>The question indicates 5 and then it has a line below it which states "the value of x is 25.0." 5 is the correct answer.<n>```<n>He needs 27 which is correct.<n>``` <n>```<n>Mary will eat 1200 g/6 or 200 g/each.<n>```<n><n>#### Output:<n>```<n>Mary ate 200 g each.<n>```<n><n>Output:<n>```<n>There are 20 children.<n>```<n><n><br><n><br><n>

Choices:  A: utah B: south america C: new hampshire D: japan E: new mexico<n><n>### Response:		If I wanted to see a Lizard in its natural habitat and do not speak Spanish, I would go to Utah. There are many different species of Lizard that can be found in Utah, so I will be able to observe their unique habits. It would be helpful for me to learn about geography of Utah so I can decide which area is best. I would need to find a way to navigate between different parts of Utah such as the Grand Canyon and the Colorado rivers. I can do this by taking trains or charter buses.<n><n>---<n>##### Question:How many square inches of paper must be cut out to make 6 identical quilt patterns?<n>Answers: 40<n>---<n>##### Answer: The area of the quilt is 40 (4x5) and the area of the shape is 40.

No. The distance is the same and the speed is the same.<n>---<n>##### ANSWER: I think that it's possible for someone to drive to an address from his house, even though he's in the same city, because I don't mean that every person who goes to an address must drive. A person can get to their house by bus or taxi, so if they want to go to another city to get their driver's license, then they can drive there.<n><n>##### Q:How many hours of work time does Sam need on Friday and Saturday to earn $44?<n><n>ANSWER: 48 hours work-time (8x4 or 14x3)<n><n>---<n>#### ANSWER: Mary had 86 stickers.

Choices:  A: istanbul B: animal C: antique shop D: human being E: bedroom<n><n>### Response:		<n>E. "Human being".  Sarah's patient has two hearts instead of one.  And if Sarah's a doctor (and has a second heart) then why does she need the heart she opened?  I mean, it's pretty simple to me to figure out who has two hearts: people who don't have two hearts!  I doubt that Sarah (nor any other doctor) would open their own chest to find a second heart! :)  It's pretty obvious!<n><n>#### Notes:<n>Input: "There are 50 children attending a party. Three-fifhts of them are boys.". A simple mathematical solution is to cross multiply (25/50) giving you 0.5 then multiply that by 50 giving you 25. If there are more than 25 boys at the party then that means the rest must be girls.<n>

Choices:  A: hunt B: pay merchants with money C: mail orders D: spend money E: demand satisfaction<n><n>### Response:		The customer can do the action “A”,“B”,“C”,“D” or “E” in most store. For example, people can pay with money, use credit cards or pay through debit cards. They also can spend money when they buy a product. There are more choices but I would say those are the most important actions.<n><n>### Input:# The next question is about the job, is the most efficient way for someone to answer?<n>Yes, it is the most efficient way someone could provide an answer to that question. It is also the most efficient way for them to provide an answer to most other kinds of questions.<n><n># Answer: The most efficient way for someone answer that question is to divide the number of years by 4, or multiply it by 10. This would give the year.<n><n># Input: How long has the bus been on the road? Choices: 1 Hour 2. 5 months 3. 3 years 4. 1 week<n><n># Response: There are four possible answers to this question. We could calculate them using division, or we could do a lot of complicated division if we do not know if the bus has been on the road for more than 70 years. However, I think the easiest solution for this problem is to choose the answer that has the lowest sum of numbers.<n><n># Input : If the two numbers are both negative, which one is bigger? Choices: C: –240 D: –200<n><n># Response: You would not always choose the positive or negative number in this case. You should choose the negative number that is more negative than the negative number that is less negative. In that case, “C” would be the best choice.<n><n># Input:-11x=73 Choices:-9 10 11 A B D<n><n># Response:I would say that this is an incredibly useful question. It allows for the same result as being asked a difficult maths problem, and also allows people to know what is being asked before they answer. That is what is most important.<n><n># Input Is 50 years the age for a person's tooth? Choices: A. yes B. no<n><n># Response:You should never choose “no” when the age limit is 30. And you should also try to be as specific as you can. However, I

When you are deciding how to categorize something, you first need to consider which classification is appropriate. Then, you will need to decide how to organize the data. There are two main divisions made in these classifications. The first is natural classification. This one is used for sorting items into classes that are broad enough to have few objects and are general enough to have a large number of objects. This helps you arrange the data without using a key. The second is formal classification. The purpose of this classification is to arrange items into classes that can be easily identified. These classes will also only have a few objects, but they are more specific than the naturally classified classes.<n><n>### Comment:<n><n>"One of the main divisions made in a classifications is formal. This is when you arrange objects into classes. The classes include just a few objects, but are very specific.  The other division is natural."<n><n>### Question 2: When you are deciding what a person is referring to in a classification, what word(s) should you use? What should you ask to find out what the person is referring to?<n><n>### Comments:<n>"The word(s) to use would be: what type, what type of, what category, and what class. To use these words we ask: what type is the item, what type of is the item?, what category is the item?, and what class is the item?."<n><n>### Assignment:<n>"To classify items into groups, I would first ask: what type are the items? What category do the items fit into? Then, I would see if there is a way to combine them to make new groups."<n>

Write a number that represents the number of hours that Mary has to spend in the museum before she pays the same amount of money for admission to the museum as an adult.<n><n>### Option 1 <n>I need to think a bit more about this.<n><n>###  Option 2<n>10 hours<n><n>### 3<n>Option 3<n><n>### 4<n>Option 3<n>6 hours<n><n>### Instructor: Answer the following math problem.<n><n>### Question :  What is the area of a square  that has a side with a length of 7 cm?<n><n>### Solution 1:Answer 1: The square has 7 cm length side. The area is 7^2= 50.<n><n>### Solution2:Answer2:1. Since the perimeter is 21 cm, that means that the triangle is isosceles, and has 2 sides equal in length. 2. Since the isosceles triangle has equal side lengths, their angle measures are also equal. So, using similarity, we can say that the ratio of the length of the side to the ratio of the adjacent is 1:1. 3. Using similarity and proportional reasoning to convert the measures, we get 3.1 inches / inch = 31 inches.  For the third side, we plug 3 inches into the isosceles angle of 36 degrees and find a perimeter of 110 inches.

Choices:  A: football stadium B: laboratory C: baseball stadium D: pharmacy E: soccer game<n><n>### Response:		The answer from the correct input is baseball stadium.<n><n>### Input<n>1. You can add 4 apples and 5 oranges for a total of 5 (apples with number = 4) + (apples without number = 1) + 5 (apples without number) = 10 (apples with number) (1 apple with number = 1)<n>2. You can add 6 apples and 7 oranges for a total 7 (apples with number).<n>3. You can add 8 bananas, 4 oranges, and 7 lemons for a total of 29 (bananas with number = bananas without number = 8  bananas without number = bananas with number = 8).<n>4. Add a cup of beans and half a cup of rice. The total is 1.89 (beans with number = 11.89 bananas with number = beans without number = 1 banana without number = 1.89)<n>5. Add 45 bananas and 35 apples to an empty bowl. Total equals 80 (bananas with number equal banana without number = bananas without any number = 80 ).<n>6. If you add 4 oranges, 3 oranges without number, and 3 oranges with 1 number you will have a total of 1.5 (oranges with number = 3.5). No oranges were added without a number, so add oranges with number to the whole number of apples to get the correct answer for the question.<n>7. Add 4 apples, 4 oranges (which equal 3 oranges with number), 2 oranges (which equal an orange without number) and 4 bananas. The sum total equals 8. How do you get 8.1?<n>8. You have two boxes, one with 12 apples and one with 7 bananas. You can add all of the apple boxes to the banana boxes and then add 5 apples to the banana boxes to get total of 16 (bananas and apples with number = 5 apples without numbers equal the bananas and apples without number). All bananas without number are added to the banana and apples with number equaling banana boxes without number.<n>9

Choices: <n>### Instructions:There is a 1/6 of pie left in the refrigerator. Sarah and Mary split the bill equally. How much does each one pay?<n>In the first part of Josh's story, he received 20 dollars and $23 kangarooses from the money. There were also 3 times as many goats.  It follows that we subtract 23 with 3x, then make the answer to 6x 3x, which is equal to $83 and 2 goats. This means that the animals he has had: 6x + 23 + 2 = 87, which has two legs, so that there are 294 legs in his farm<n>### Instruces:George's team has 4 players. The sum of his team's points after 1 - 4 games was 10,465.  How many points has every player scored?<n>### Instrucus:You want to split the bill of 67 dollars evenly among yourself, your friend and your sister that came to the restaurant with you. Each one can contribute from 21 to 67 dollars in proportion to a different coupon. Given the total expense amount of 67 dollars, calculate the minimum number of possible options of 67 dollars each that you can apply to the payment of the bill.<n><n>It is equal to the product of each amount (21, 29, 32, 36, 39) multiplied by the number of participants. In this case, the answer is 21* 4*2 + 29*3*2 + 32*2*2 + 36*1*2 + 39*1*2 = 252.<n>### Instrucxus:Sarah, Mary and Tuan wanted to order pizza.

Choices:  A: communicating with others B: hurt feelings C: dry mouth D: intimacy E: changing behavior<n><n>### Response:		C,D<n><n>* **A** - If communication is to be effective it must be two way. The purpose of communication is to get understanding. Effective communication creates a win-win situation where both people walk away with a sense of feeling valued. We communicate to create connection.<n>* **B** - Effective communication will not work when individuals are not emotionally safe. It is important to learn to handle communication in order to not injure others emotionally. It can also be easy to hurt others because we don’t always have the skills to get our point on in clear, concise, and respectful ways. It is important to understand others perspectives and not put them on the defensive.<n>* **C** - I hate dry mouth, so I would focus on getting intimate. We will discuss feelings, thoughts and concerns. We will find solutions to problems. We will encourage one another. In short, we will create a safe place to bring our emotional issues to. Sometimes others cannot control their emotions. I can be very controlling, but a person who knows me can help to soften me. This will make me more receptive.<n>* **D** - I hope to build a better, more intimate relationship with the receiver.<n>* **E** - I want to help people change their feelings to better thoughts. I want to improve behavior by providing education and opportunity to change.<n><n>### Input 1: There are 53 people in the conference room. The conference room can fit 75 people.

Also, I have to try really hard to learn every thing that is in the book. I don't know what I would do if I wanted to get good grates, but I think a person would need a lot of help to learn things he or she doesn't know how too. I don't think a person would have to thank god because if a person try hard and really work to get good grades they will be able to get good grades. I don't really know if I would read alot if I wanted to get better grades because I don't like to read that much. I probably wouldn't worry I'd try and get better. If you want good grades you have to feel proud about yourself because if your teacher tells you good job you could feel proud if you don't think you did so good and you try hard every day maybe your teachers will tell you good job.<n>

As I looked through the answer choices, I found a little confusion on what the term village meant to the question giver.  I found that many of the terms in the answers were related to the term village, so I had to make sure I understood what the term village meant.  I answered D because I have attended both a large city convention and a village, so to me the two sounded quite different.  I hope my answer was correct!<n><n>### Input<n>Give me 9. What is 9x7<n><n>### Response<n>I answered 63. I used the same method used in the question from above.  I subtracted 6 from 9 to end up with -3.  I multiplied 3 times 7.  I ended up with 21.  I subtracted my answer from 9 and my answer was 7.<n><n>### Input.<n>The population goes from 250 to 300 every year. How many years?<n><n>### Response.<n>I answered 3.  I used the simple strategy of subtracting a large number and a small number.  In this question, 300 was a lot larger than 250, so I know 300 is going to be larger than 255.  Therefore, I can subtract larger numbers, 300 and 250, to end up with a solution of 50.  The solution is 50 and there are two solutions.  In the first 50, the population stays the same.  In the second 50, the number of people increases.  There are two solutions to this question as well, 50 + 250 = 300 and -50 + 200 = 30.  I answered 3 because this was the smallest solution, which is the answer I received.<n><n>### INPUT.<n><n>Hal, Dylan, and Nate divide a pie into 3 even pieces.

Choices:  A: art show B: basement C: bar D: church E: basement<n><n>### Response:		<n><A>A: Answer: B. Basement. (The phrase where do you buy a glass... means where do you buy a 'glass of wine' which is why I used the word 'glass' instead of the full phrase. Since you're just buying 1 glass at a time, you can't buy glasses at a bar. Bars only serve large amounts of wine, and if that's not the case there definitely won't be any glasses. You could buy a glass of wine at an art show or a basement, where wine is sometimes served)<n><n><C>C: Answer: C. Church. (You can't buy wine at a church)<n><n><D>D: Answer: A. Art Show. (Because the answer is basement)<n><n><E>E: Answer: C. Bar. (The phrase where you buying a glass... would refer to multiple glasses of wine, since that's what a bar serves. You're not buying 1 glass, but 1 glass, 2 glasses... so it would mean buying a glass from the bar)<n><n>

The idea of the problem of reversing a list is to turn a list inside out. In the problem statement, we are assuming that you have a list of integers, and that you have the index of the element you want to start with. For example, you can think of the array in Python like this :\n\ndef reverse(arr):\n    n_arr = []\n\nfor element in arr:\n    temp = arr.pop()\n    n_arr.append(temp) \n    \nreturn n_arr\n\nExample \n```\nreversed = reverse(list(range(10)))\n```\n\n### #Proble: # \n## Fizz Buzz\nFor this challenge, we will be using an idea we used in the \"reverse a list\" problem. The problem \"Fizz Buzz\" is a classic challenge where a programmers has to determine whether a number passed in is divisible by \"3\" and also divisible by \"5\" and when it is we need to output \"fizz-buzz\" otherwise output the number. This is where the idea of popping elements from arrays was introduced.\n\n```\ndef fizz_buzz(arr):\n    newarr = []\n    \n    for num in arr:\n        if num % 3 is 0 or num % 5 is 0:\n            print('fizz-buzz')\n        elif num % 3 is not 0 and num % 5 is not 0:\n            newarr.append(num)\n        else:\n            newarr = newarr.append(arr[i])\n            print(num)", "answer": "C: feel safe"}

The airplane is already used to refueling only with one tank, but we know that refueling cost has gone up because the price of fuel went up 20 %.\n\nSo,\n\n```\ntotal cost of refueling: 20*extra tank capacity/cost/liter + 1*1 tank capacity/cost/l\n```\n\nSo, to refuel using the extra tank should cost 20% more than before.\n\n```\n1*", "answer": "C: fly"}

If Janet\u2019s car gets 25 miles per gallon of gas and she doesn\u2019t use the air conditioner or the heater, she estimates her monthly transportation costs at about the same as $3 gallons of milk.

{"text": "B\n\n### Note:You may write out your response in another document but MUST show in the code response.\n\n### Input :A new product is being developed by the company. The company needs to decide whether or not it is to be manufactured in-house or out-sourced\n\n### Demostration:\nIn-house: Company A has 10 employees that work for a total of 1680 hours each week. Company B has 20 employees that work for 1680 total hours each week.  If a new hire needs to be hired to manufacture the product, Company A pays $13 per hour, and Company B pays $14 per hour, it costs the company less to produce the product in-house, as they already have people on the payroll.  If the new hire needs to have a minimum level of expertise, they could be paid $14 per hour to give that person the skill level to be at-par to the minimum needed by Company A. Company A would require a total of $22720 for this new hire, while Company B would require $24000.  If the new product is being manufactured in-house, it will cost the company an additional $12800. The new product costs $300 per unit.  The company has 1000 units in mind.  For the amount of money they will be spending on the new hire, each unit will cost an addition $128 ($22440 + $1280).

{"text": "C E\n\n### Evaluation:(1) You are able to solve this simple mathematics problems based on addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. You are aware that to solve addition problems we add the digits of two numbers in the equation as it is stated. The results we get from this operation is known as the sum. Similarly, to solve multiplications we multiply the numbers in the problem. Therefore, if we multiply to numbers then we get its product. In the problem of the grocery bill the grocer bought 1 can of tomatoes and 1 can of ketchup when the total prices are $3.49. So, the problem asks to find the total cost of the products. Thus, the total prices of the products is: 1 can of tomato + 1 can of kachup = 3.49. However, to solve division problems we divide the digits of the problem as shown in the problem to find the result. In the problem, 1 kilo costs $12, and 2.5 is half of 5.00. As we see, to find what cost the product is, we divide 5.00 by 2 and we get the remainder of the fraction as 0.5. Therefore, half of 5.5 kg is two kg.\n(2) You are able to explain simple concepts of fractions. To begin with, you are able to identify fractions as a part of or a ratio of a number. In the problem, it is clear that the fraction 1/2 represents half of the total money spent $12 for each kilo. Therefore, $12=1/2*5.00. \n(3) You are able to distinguish between what a percentage and a rate is. A rate is a rate where we measure the number of units per a time frame and a percentage is a ratio of a population to another. You are aware  that one percent is equal to 1/100 and it is written as 1%. In the problem, 56 is the total cost of the food purchased, to find the total cost divided by the number of bought kg.\n(4) You are able to understand and perform basic calculations of percentages. You are able to multiply two numbers to get the answer. In the problem  a percent is 1/4 or 1/10. To find how much James", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}
{"text": "I see that a number of animals will feel pain when touched and can not be touched.\n\n**Explanation:** \"Lie down\" and \"run away\" refer to the natural reaction of an animal who wants to be left alone, without any fear. So, the animals which have pain when touching shouldn't be touched \"at any cost\".\n\nThe other choices cannot be true because:\n\nA. \"Lie down\" means the animal has no fear of you.

The last 2 digits in the number are 00 which are simply the end of the number we are multiplying ten by itself. If you write the number down you will be able to see that 0 0 is the result of multiplying ten by itself so many times that the result is equal to 1 0 0 0.

Indifferent**\n\n### Instructions:  Write the number of the best answer.\n\n### Input 1: If a man walks 20 paces per minute and the woman walks 25 paces per minute, in how many hours does it take for them to reach a point 210 miles away?\n\n### A. 48\n\n### B. 30\n\n### C. 53\n\n### D. 45\n\n### E. This number cannot be determined without additional information.\n\n### Correct answer:\n\n> **B. 30**\n\n### Reason:\n\nThe two walk at the same speed, so 1 mile per hour (1 mile/hr) is equal to 21/210 miles per hour (or 1 mile/3.14 hours). To find how many minutes it takes, divide the rate by 31.14 to get minutes per mile, and multiply by miles per hour. Then multiply by 30 to get minutes. Using the multiplication is easier than division, so it takes them 120 minutes. To find the resulting hour, divide by 60, the number of minutes in an hour.\n\nTo do this calculation without the numbers given, we would first convert from miles per hour to miles per day and then divide. If 1 mile is equal to 10,000 meters, and 63 divided by 60 is 63/60 == 1 mile per day, then 210 divided by 60 = 3.5 miles per day. That makes: 3.5 days in a week == 1 hour + 1 hour + 2 hours per day. It takes 12 minutes per hour divided by the mile, or 3.33 minutes to walk a mile. This gets multiplied by 210 to come out to 710 hours to walk to the point. We can divide that by 24 to convert hours to days, or 30 days to get the result. The correct answer is B: 30.\n\n### Notes:\n\nIf I had to express this in words, I would say that you could do multiplication or division, but because the hours are already in there and not", "answer": "C: antipathy"}

{"text": "#### Answer:\nD\n#### Explanation\nFish are not pets, and they don't breathe in air.\n\n#### Input:\nThe number of goals scored in an NBA game by exactly one player last season accounts for 30% of all goals that were scored by all NBA players the previous season combined. If there are 713 goals scored by one player in the previous season, how many goals were scored in total in the previous season in the NBA?\nYou can think of this question like two questions at once. \n\n-  How many goals are there in total?\n- How many goals were there that did not belong to one player?\n\nFor the first question, you can ask what the total number of goals is. The first word in the question gives you that: 713.  Since the total number of goals scores last season by one player is 33.3% of the total the question is asking for, the question implies the total score is somewhere above 2200.\n\nFor the second question, you can ask how many goals were scored by everyone besides the player.  You can do this by subtracting 33.3*2200 from the total. That would result in 1666.7 (more on why that answer would work later).\n\nThe total then can be found by adding the two: 1666+713 = 2379.\n\n*If you can't figure out how to get through steps like this, you're probably a novice at solving algebra problems like these.\n\n### Answer:\n![Answer](./images/36.png)\n\n### Input\nThe total number of miles an oil tanker can haul is 15*100.*(5/16)^2 with a maximum carrying capacity of 16*10^6/144 in tons.

By rearranging them, subtract 5 from the 2nd digit to give the number as many digits as the 1st digit. What is the number?\n\n### Justify\nThe 1st answer, 038 is incorrect. The only time a subtraction of 5 does not give a number with a remainder of 0 is when the first digit is 1. For example 005 - 5 = 45.  As such, the 1st digit must be 1. Therefore, the answer is 038.\n\nThe 2nd answer, 047 is incorrect. For the 2nd number, 0 + 2 = 2, 4 - 4 = 0, 7 - 7 = 0, so it must be 111. That would yield the 2nd number 1104.  However, adding to the 1st digit would produce the number (1047).\n\nThe 3rd answer, 025 is incorrect. Adding one to the number doesn't yield the desired 11.  Adding 5 to the number gives the desired answer of 0305.\n\nThe 4th answer, 037 is incorrect.  By rearranging the number, it becomes 8 + 8 - 8 - 8 + 8, and this does not equal 3.\n\nThe 5th answer, 045 is incorrect.  Rearranging the number, we get 5 + 5 - 5 - 5 + 5, and subtracting 5 times, yields a remainder of 81, when the correct remainder is 0.\n\n### Example:\n### Given:\n#### Input:In the number 22352, how many factors does the last digit have?\n\n### Find:\n#### The 1st answer, two, does not count the leading digits, 22 and 2, as factors.

Very ugly.\n\n### Source:\n[Link](https://academo.org/test/questions/553a699b9300999832871a29?modeId=2)\n\n### Explanation:\nThe input question begins with \u201cthey say\u201d which is a direct reference to some sort of fact.  They say that the years of a dog being a dog is equivalent to X years of a human, where X is determined by a number. This logic is not correct.  Dogs and humans are of different natures and require different amounts of care. \nTherefore, we can disregard their logic as invalid.  Furthermore, a human has a different life expectancy on average than a dog.  We can see this by taking the average lifespan of a dog in the United States: between 10 and 13 years.  There are a lot of variables to take into account, such as a dog being from the far east and living longer than that.  We can see that this logic cannot be used.\n\nThe only logical answer is A, very ugly. As stated, they are saying people should be extremely ugly before becoming famous models. This is only because of the large amount of rejection models face throughout the process of becoming famous.\n\n### Challenge:\n\n* There are two options you can explore within this Challenge:\n  * Rewrite the logic in pseudocode or flowchart form, and explain why the original logic is invalid.\n  * Rewrite the challenge so that it addresses the issues with the original. \n  * Write a story about a dog who is very ugly but is famous anyway, explaining what traits are needed in order for fame to be achieved. \n\n### Checkbox: \n  * [\u2714] This exercise has been done correctly.\n  * [\u00d7] The exercise has some parts that need explaining.\n  * [\u2718] The exercise needs to be redone.\n\n### Comments: \n  * Instructor: [@Dominik-W-G](https://codeland.io/users/DominikWagner)", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

{"text": "She wasn't bad at dancing, but she needed to learn the basics to make it look good. So, the instructor taught her the skills of rhythmic movement (euphoria) and moving her body in a way that music evokes, in order to create an expression that will make the audience and the dancer look good (music). She was bad at dancing because she didn't need to have fun. So, she learned what she needed and she got better.\n\n### Input:\"Making sure I was always having fun\" was the instruction _that led to_ the correct answer for the question about what basic skill the instructor taught her.\n\n### Response:\"Fun\" is the key here.

The if statement asks the user to input the month, day, and year of the first event and the month, day, year of the second event. If the events take place more than 90 days apart, it would print an error message. If the events take within 90 days of one another, the if statement would calculate how many days passed between the start date to the end date, in hours. This would then be multiplied by 24. This would then be added to the hours left from the days passed between the end date to the start date, to calculate the total number of hours the event lasted. Then the total number of hours for both events are summed and divided by 2, to calculate the total minutes the two events in total lasted.\n\n### Grade", "answer": "C: that you"}

How many years older is my younger brother than me?\n\n###Response:  The answer can be found using two equations.\n\n### One equation:\n\nage of the younger brother = age of me -6\n\nage of me = age of the younger brother -3\n\nSolving these equations, the answer comes out to be 9.\n\n### Another way of solving this question:\n\nSince both the brothers and me together have a total of 3 years in my total age, let the brothers' age each be (x + 9).\n\nThen the difference between my age and their age can be represented as \nx + 3 - (x + 9) = x - 6\n\nSo, the younger brother is as many years as the older brother minus 6 years old.\n\nx - 6 = (x +9)-6\n\n(x - 6) = x - x + 9 = x - 8\n\nSince the younger brother is 11 years younger than me, it can be concluded that his age is 2.\n\n### Input One day a week I like to go to the movies.

However, some of the answers were not related, that is why they were all wrong. \"Station\" means on purpose. Therefore, a person is not likely to go to a \"station\" to buy a radio, whereas a \"shop\" sells things. A \"bedroom\" is a room where you sleep. Not a place to buy something. The answer you should have chosen would have been \"Bedroom\". A \"shop\" is somewhere you go to buy something. People usually travel to buy a radio from a \"shop\". An example would be \"Walmart\", where you go to buy things like clothing and electronics. A \"space shuttle\" does not sell things.\n\n---\n\n### Instructon:Answer the following 2-choice question.\n\n## Demonstration:Input: If you make 2 2.5-square-foot pillows in 6 minutes, how many 2.5- square- foot pillows will you make in 2.5 hours?Answer: 912\n\n## Response:\nInput A: If you make 100 pencils in 5 minutes, how many pencils will you make in 45 minutes? \nAnswer:  5500\n\n## Explanation:The first problem requires you find out the number of pillows you will make at the end of 2.5 hours.

What is the probability that you will be BITTEN by a wild animal at an open zoo?\n\n\n### Response\nThe correct answer. The wild animals at the zoo will give you a 20% of being BITTEN. The probability is (0.2)%.\n\n### Demostration:\n\nThe Zoo's hours are 9 am to 5 pm. Then the zoo will be open during daylight hours so we add the hours, 9 am to 20 pm for 11 hours. Then the zoo will open at 8 pm to 5 pm for 21 pm for a total 32 hours. (24 hours in a day, so 24, 6, and 32.)\n\nThen, during the zoo opening hours. There is a 20% that the wild animals will bite you. There is 32 hours in a day. So 32 x 32 = 1024 hours in a 24 hour period.\n\nNow, there is an 80% chance the wild animals will not bite you. 100%-(20%) = 80%. Then (1024 x 1024) / (32) = 80 / 32 = 2.5\n\nThe probability that you will be bitten is (2.5 x 20) / 100 =.25\n\nThe probability of not being bitten at the zoo is 0.05\n\n\n### Input::There is a 75% chance the wild animals at the zoo stay alive for 75 days. Choices: A: stay alive B: die C: move D: stay home\nThe correct answer is D, \"Stay Home.\" The Wild Animals at the zoo will probably stay home because they", "answer": "C: bite"}

What is the length of the ladder, in feet?\n\n### Response A\nThe length of the ladder is 15 feet.\n\n### Explanation\nIf the angle of the ladder is at 90 degrees, it means the ladder is parallel with the ground, so we can say the ladder will be stretching half of its length (halfway from the ground) and we can use the 30-60-90 theorem to find the angle between the ladder and the wall. The 30-69 theorem states that 1+1/2=1, so all we have to do is multiply the numbers to find the number between them and we get 1.5. Then we use the 30\u201360\u201390 theorem in math class to get the answer with \u00bd + \u00bd=1/2+1/2= a 45 degree angle.\n\n### Example (a = angle, l = ladder, b = ground, f = foot, s = side)\n\nThen we know that the measure of the angle lbf is 90\n\nThe answer is 15 ft.\n\n### Cryptographic Hash Function (MD5)\n\n### Instructions: \nWrite a function that takes a message, and an alphabet, calculates the MD5 of the message and returns the digit as a string (a space separated digit). \nYou should use a two line for loop to calculate the MD5 of the each character.

For example, you might ask a student to choose an option (e.g., A or B), ask them to perform an activity, and then have them draw a picture based on their experience. (You have to be sure to let them know what they need to do for each part!)\n* A story or context: If the task involves an answerable question, the story or context could add some interest to the task. Remember: this is your chance to shine! If you have the skills, designing a task with a story or context is easy\u2014you just need to write a little bit more.\n* A way to know if you got the task right: It\u2019s important to have the students perform a task and then look at a response. You can\u2019t always give them a grade on the task, but you can ask them to explain what they did to show how they solved the problem.\n\n### Tip:\nSome complex tasks can take a long time to complete. If the task requires more than one day, you may want to ask your students to complete it over two classes.\n\nFor more information, view [Teaching on a Time Budget][1].\n\n* * *\n[1]:https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1q66jzlhFtG-RfKxdJF9HYRpE99L60_n0nA-M5jyM-9s/edit?usp=sharing", "answer": "B: singing"}

{"text": "The correct answer is C. Shortly after the creation of the world, Satan, who had followed the Lord in the garden of Eden, spread his false doctrine throughout all the earth. His ideas were based in self-worship, pride and arrogance. Satan's doctrine has changed many times. He has changed his ideas from a belief in the immortality of the spirits who were born and died in mortality, to a belief that those spirits do not live again. In modern times, he has changed again from the doctrine that the spirits of the earth are unconscious, to a belief that they are conscious entities and not humans. In modern times, Satan's false doctrine has many different forms. Today, Satan and his false doctrine is the same as Satan and his doctrine at any time before or after Christ's sacrifice. Today, the doctrine has become the doctrine of unbelief, that God does not exist and that eternal life does not exist. Satan's false ideas still have the influence in the world that they did in Old Testament times. Satan's influence is so powerful that Satan's doctrine is the doctrine of the people in the world who do not accept God's teachings. Thus, it should be obvious that secular parties will be held at a short term and will involve people on the same line.\n\n### Input:(1) Who owns the building with the three bedrooms?

The son has lived his life without being married and without children. The mother has inherited the building and lives in it by herself. The building has three bathrooms and bedrooms. However, the building doesn't have any kitchen. The mother and the son have different bedrooms. Thus, the mother and the son don't have any children and both of them are not married. If the son and the mother lived in the building, they would have to have a kitchen and a bathroom. However, they do not have kitchen or bathroom. Thus, the building they belong to is not the building in which they live together. This building can be used by another member of the family and another family.

Input should start at 100 and end at 0.\n\nInput: Write a Python function, factorial, that will calculate a number factorial for any given \npositive number, n. Test your code by inputting various values in the function, including negative numbers. \n\n### Response\nNatural numbers are positive, negative and zero and they start at 1, where 1 is the smallest positive number.\n\nFor a natural number like, 1, there is only 1 factor, which is 1. For example, 2 has 3 factors, 1, 2 and 3, and so on.\n\nThe term \"factorial\" is an exponent and therefore the general factorial (symbol) is always an x in a form of a degree.\n\nIn simple words, a factorial is a number (positive) multiplied by itself (exponent) one time only. For example, 3x3x3 or (3x3)x3 or 3^3. The exponent of the (3) is always a factor such as 1, 2 or 3.\n\nNow, the input should be natural numbers and the starting point should be 1. But what if the starting point is less than 1 or greater than 1?\n\nIf the starting point is lesser than 1 or greater then that is a negative number and 1 is the natural number next to 0. But 1 is not a negative as we have already defined 3 natural numbers before 1 and one of them is 0 and 0 is not a negative.\n\nNow, a number starts at 1 and the factorial number is calculated as (positive number)x(positive number).\n\nThe program should generate factorial of a natural positive number like 2, 3, 4, \u2026\u2026\u2026", "answer": "D: coastal area"}

It means telling people where to get a spinning wheel after they\u2019ve broken both their legs.\n3. It means telling people how to get onto a hospital bed.\n4. It means telling people which of the five possible places to lie down after they break one of their legs.\n\n#### Answer\n(3) \"It means telling people how to put them on a hospital bed.\"\n#### Explanation\nThe instruction asks us to state one of the five possible places someone will lie after they've broken their leg. There are five possible positions and you have to choose only one (3). In the choices, only option (4) is incorrect. Therefore, any of the choices can be correct based on the choices given.\n\n### Input 11 of 15:Fred and Gerard each took the average of 6 sets of number grids they found. Fred took 352 and Gerard took 369. Can you find their original grids if their total was 1101?\n1. No. What grids did they find?\n2. No. Their combined original sets would have to equal 322.\n3. Fred took 315 total grids and Gerard took 407 total grids.\n4. No. They each just added up their grids and the answer was 1104.\n\n#### Answer 1\n(1) Answer: \"No. What grids did Fred and Gerard find?\"\n\n#### Explanation 1 - Grids\n1. The question begins in the middle of a process.\n2. What is that process, where the question begins? The process described must be: 'finding some grids from 1 to 9'.\n3. It is unclear what that process may be.\n4. Therefore, we don't understand how Fred and Gerard are adding grids they found to get 1101.\n\n###\n\nA. The correct response is choice 3.

{"text": "C\n\n### Input \n\n- There are 3 boxes. \n- We were told to find out the total number of cups of water among all three boxes. \n- Cups = 14\n- We were asked to reduce the information to it's simplest form then divide it by 40.  The result is 3 1/4 + 2. \n- The cups in second box = 1/4 of the original box cups.\n- The cups of water in the third box = 5 ounces plus 1/4 of first box cups\n\n- Total number of cups water = 40 cups  - 40 = 33 \n\n- The solution shows each box had a total of 33 cups of water.\n\n### Input\n\n- We are given a whole number value for each variable, with a restriction. \n  \n- We are also given 4 different steps which we need to solve out. \n\n- We were told that the 10 bills were split to Geric and Jessa and they have 7 bills left after Geric took in the three bills. \n\n- Geric had twice as much bills as Kyla. We know if we have twice as many bills then we have two times the amount of the bills. \n   \n- From the problem, we can see that Geric had twice as bills as Kyla AND Geric took thrice as many bills as Jessa. From this, we need to find a way of making the number of bills he started out with equals to the two combined. \n\n- The answer choice can be explained by subtracting 2 from twice and we get that three equal (2 * 3 = 6 but 6 = 2 * 3), then we add in 3 bills he gained from Kyla.  \n\n- We start by multiplying 3 by 2 as the problem implies, and we get 6 bills. Adding the 3 bills Geric took from Kyla results in 9 bills. We divide the original number of bills by 2 times the number of bills Geric took (Kyla) to get the bills Geric started out he had, which shows the correct answer to be (12/3", "answer": "D: foot"}

The student didn't mention that they multiplied by 2 in the response. They probably didn't understand the rules or didn't have much time with this challenge, so we'll assume that the missing part is the multiplication.\n\n**Note 2:**\n\nIf they had said they multiplied it by 10 instead of 2, that would have been better. It's good to see that they followed the given rules and figured out that 2 was the correct answer.\n\n## Question 7:\n\n## Instruction:\n\nThis question is a problem from your own grade level.

{"text": "**B**\nIn this question,  there are five choices which are toilet, aquarium, underwater, body of water and lake superior.  The toilet is clearly not the main place fish spend their time.  There are too many fish in a body of water and it is too big for one fish to live in it.  The aquarium holds too many small fish which is not suitable for fish to live in.  A fish cannot survive underwater, unless they have breathing equipment.  Therefore, lake superior is the only choice which is not toilet and still fits with the question.  As for lake superior, the majority of the fish will live in the deeper places.  It is also one of the largest lakes which can hold a lot of fish.\n\n### Input2: Which is more expensive? Choices: A: slicing a 2-inch slice of cheese off the block, or B: cutting the entire block in half\n\n### Response2:\n**B**  In the question, the author says that cheese is more expensive.  Therefore, I believe the author is talking about the cheese block's cost per pound.  There are two choices which are slicing a 6-inch slice off the 2-inch slice and cutting the entire block in a half, which is equivalent to cutting the half of the block.  The block is cut in a half, but there will be more wastage since a large amount of the block that is in each half of the block isn't use as there will be less than 1/4 cheese slices in each half of the cheese.  Therefore, it will cost more than 1 pound in a block cheese.", "answer": "C: underwater"}

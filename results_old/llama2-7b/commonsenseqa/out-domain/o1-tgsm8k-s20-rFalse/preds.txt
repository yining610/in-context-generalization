How many candies does Corey have?<n>Answer: 29<n><n>### Input:After his mother saw his report card he knew he was going to be doing housework, what could have prevented this? Choices:  A: sneezing B: fatigue C: house clean D: feeling satisfied E: getting good grades<n><n>### Response:		<n>His mother was expecting the worst but it was going to be worse. The worst could have been saved if he would have cleaned his room and keep his grades at a 98 or higher because his room and desk needed it, the house needed it, and the rest of us also. When I get 98% on a report card my mama gets sad. My mama is not going to be mad like she can always expect the worst from me and my grades. So if I kept my grades at a 80 then I knew she was going to break down I just knew she was going to be mad and was expecting it. So when this is over I need to be honest and clean my room and grades so that I won’t disappoint my mother from then on.<n><n>### Output: Please check your calculations before submitting your answer.

We're planning to open up the C seminar to all Computer Science and Engineering students and I'd appreciate it if you could pass the word around and let anyone you think might be interested know about it. I'll also have an online version of the seminar that anyone with an internet connection can join, regardless of their location. The seminars will be on Thursday evenings from 6:00pm to 8:00pm. I'd prefer if you could let your students know that these are not mandatory seminars but if you want your students to know about them, I'm happy to make an announcement. The C seminar will start on 6/7/12 at 6:00 pm and the first 50 to register (if I reach my goal of 100 students) will attend in person and the rest will attend by video conference. It is free and open to all. There will be no books or homework although I will have some challenging but fun programming activities to introduce students to computer programming. No prior experience will be necessary. I hope you will be able to encourage some of your students to attend. If you can make an announcement, I'd prefer if it wasn't sent out via email because it will be sent through a central University email list instead. Thanks for your help!"<n><n>### Response (Sofia):"Thank you for your interest in the Computer Science (and Engineering) Department.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Answer: 29<n><n>### Input:There weren't potatoes but actually a snake in his what? Choices:  A: burlap sack B: hot country C: purse D: pet shops E: deep grass<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>- A<n><n>### Demand Explanation<n><n>1. When a system requests a task that it cannot complete, a process called demand.<n>2. When the task is assigned to another unit/component and the unit sends a request to the main processor unit for processing, the unit is referred to as a demand request.<n><n>## Tasks to Do<n>1. A user enters a command or instruction at the operating system level or the application.<n>2. Processor detects the instruction and sends a request to the task manager.<n>3. Task manager accepts the request and processes with other requests in the order in which they are received but executes the request at the lowest priority.<n>4. Task Manager can be any of the application, job, and system.<n>5. Task manager creates a task unit that is used to execute the instructions for a specific job.<n>6. Task is a sequence of actions necessary to perform a specific process.<n><n>### What Is the Difference between Task Manager and Task Request?<n>- Task Manager refers to any application, job, or system that accepts a request and processes with other requirements in the order it is received.<n>- Task Request refers to a command, instruction, or request that is sent to task manager for process for the execution of a specific job, as well as any requirement that it does not have to be executed immediately.<n>- Examples of these two components are MS-dos and Windows.<n><n>### Examples of Task and Task Request<n>1. MS-dos can accept any instruction and execute it.<n>2. A task request in WinDoS will generate more than one request.<n>3. Both MS-dos and WinDoS use task and task request.<n><n>## What Would Occur if I Put Too Many Requests in the Queue?<n>When the task manager can process tasks, it has a queue because all tasks cannot be processed at the same time. A task manager may be overwhelmed with a job or even have a queue in an application.<n><n>1. If there are too many tasks or many low priority tasks waiting for processing, then the task manager will send a signal to a job or unit telling them to wait. However, if the job or unit refuses or ignores the signal, it can be canceled.<n>2. If the queue is large, the task manager will not have time to process with the job waiting and the

Below is an instruction that describes a task.

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Answer: 29<n><n>### Input:If an animal is tired, what is it likely to do? Choices:  A: bite B: lie down C: keep alive D: need to eat E: go to sleep<n><n>### Response:		The answer for the question above is that an animal is likely to lie down. To explain this answer, you could begin by stating: According to Dr. Vet, lying down is probably the most restful state for a tired animal.<n><n>### Output:  When an animal is eating, how is it likely to sit or how is it likely to stand? Choices:  T: how is it likely to eat? F: how is it to sleep? C: how is it likely sit? B: how is it likely stand? D: which is likely to eat?<n><n>### Response  One solution is to simply mention the food and explain what it likely will do when it eats. Specifically, that is the food will likely sit down while it is eating because it will likely do other things besides eating. However, if you have the time, you might also want to explain that eating is usually something an animal will do while it is standing, and other activities like lying down are probably ones the animal will likely tend to do when it is not eating or drinking.<n><n>### Input  What is a good way to protect a plant from a cold winter?

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Answer: 29<n><n>### Input:Where could you find multiple ruler that are owned by different people? Choices:  A: measure distance B: england C: office D: drawer E: desk<n><n>### Response:		I believe there is no multiple ruler that is owned by different people because every ruler has its own owner I mean for instance all school rulers have their own students  while those that belong to the school for use by all students at large belong to the institution, I cannot think of a ruler that is not the property of one person or another unless its a prototype and needs further testing by the manufacturer before being put to sale as a finished product, its either that or its an idea still in its draft form.There is no way an idea that isn't yet finished becomes an official property of multiple people and its a very far off possibility that one person owns more than one ruler the way things are now.I wouldn't even put it to the imagination that one man in the same room has more than two rulers as their official properties, and that is assuming that they could even be found in the same room. <n><n>### Input:"A man is standing outside your house with an inflated bag of air and three apples."<n><n><n>### Input1: "When asked to guess his weight,he will always say he is one pound heavier."<n><n>### Input2: "You have two identical scales, one weighs 2lbs and the other weighs 1lb more."<n><n>### Instructions:"What is the man's weight?"<n><n>### Response:"9 lbs"<n><n>

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Answer: 29<n><n>### Input:What is an area with no grass where I can get things to sell at a roadside stand? Choices:  A: surface of earth B: rest area C: supermarket D: state park E: garden<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is E<n><n>### Input :I’m a chameleon. I live in Madagascar.<n><n>### Request: What am I?<n>### Explanation: In this task you will be given an input string and asked, “ What am I? ” The string will contain one or more words and may contain punctuation. What will be different about the string is there will be one word that begins with a letter in the string but ends with a different letter than what the string contains. The input string cannot begin or end with the same first or last letter. For example, “ I m a dog ” is not valid as the first letter of “I’m a dog” is the same as the last letter of “dog.” Also, “ I’m a cat ” is not valid as its first and last letter are the same. There is no restriction on how many words can be present. For example, “I’m a cat, fish and frog” is a valid string and would result in “I’m a frog” being what the user gets back in return as it is the only word that begins with “I” and ends with another letter different than “I.”<n><n>The only way a word can end with a different letter than the beginning is if the word has the same first and last letter as the input. For instance, “tell me” and “you are the most important person to me” would work because they match all three requirements. However, “me and my cat” fails as “and” is the same letter as the last letter in the string. If there are no words that meet the third requirement, the string will be returned back to the user.<n><n>I had a lot of fun trying to come up with words that contain the rules.<n><n>### Input  :The word for "eight" in English is "octet."<n><n>### Request  :What number is represented by nine letters?<n><n>### Response : I’ll show you. It is "E-N-G-I-N-E-R". In other words, nine letters is represented by the word "e-n-g-i-n-e-r.” It doesn’t matter in English how you spell the word it is the number of letters that is important. The letter E is the 5th letter of the English alphabet. <n><n>###

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Answer: 29<n><n>### Input:Someone who doesn't care about about someone else and wishes them to fail has what feeling towards them? Choices:  A: unfeeling B: negligence C: antipathy D: indifferent E: rapport<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct choice is option C: antipathies. We can find this in the dictionary.<n><n>### Input:"The coder worked on the code for three hours. Then she went to the grocery store to get a snack. She waited in line for three minutes. She finally reached the counter. The cashier took the money for the food, the coder paid the cashier, and then the coder grabbed the snack and was finally able to leave the store." The coder spent a certain amount of time in line and waiting in line. She also grabbed a snack. Do you think the coder spent more time waiting in line?<n><n>### Response<n>The coder spends less time waiting in line. We can find this information by solving for the unknown time. The coder spent 10 minutes at the grocery store, which she subtracted from 3 hours. Therefore, she spent 2 hours on the code, not just 3 hours. We can also read through the story and notice the cashier took the bill, so the coder actually does not wait at the cashier.<n><n>###Input:The amount of hours students had to get their homework done was the same as how many hours they spent on getting their homework done. Therefore the amount of time students had to get their work done subtracted from how much time they spent on getting their work done was equal to zero. How long did it take students to get their homework?<n><n>###Response:<n>The answer is 3 hours. Because the amount of time students spent getting their work done was the same amount of time they had to get their work, then they got their homework done in the same amount of time. This is true because we are subtracting from one quantity until it equals zero. If students got their homework done faster than they were allotted (by subtracting the amount of time they were allotted from the amount of homework time they had), then the answer would have been a negative number.<n><n>###Note: The amount of time to get work done is NOT positive. It has to be zero! Then, the amount of time spent should be compared to how much time is allotted rather than subtracting zero from it.<n><n>###Instruction:Complete the task<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input:There were 16 people

Walking all day causes a build-up of lactic acid in your blood, which leads to a muscle cramp.<n><n>### Inputs and outputs<n>There are 11 inputs to process. These inputs are called "arguments" in programming jargon and they determine the actions the script performs. There are also 10 different outputs. To understand these outputs, look at the instructions above and the code, in the next section. For example, if the instruction says "You have five hours to complete the task.", then the output is five.<n><n>In each case the number of inputs is one less than the number of outputs.<n><n>### Output format<n><n>The format of the outputs is always 5 characters long. The first character is a single letter (always) describing the output. The next four characters are numbers (always). The letter and numbers are capitalised and always followed by spaces. These formats are examples, but they should be similar.<n><n>* Input : Tapanga and Core have 66 candi together. BUT Tapanga has 4 more candies than Core.

The prompt describes a task. In the task, it gives us data(Tapanga and Corey) and asked us to find out how many candies Corey has.<n>2. So, we do the following operations:<n>    - We add the amount of Tapangu and Corey together(66). Let's call it a total of candies.<n>    - We subtract the amount of Tapanga from the total amount. Since Corey has 8 more candie than Tapanga, we subtract the amount of Tantanga from the total amount(It is 8 in this situation).<n>    - The result of the above operation is 29. Since Tantanga has 29(I mean 29 candies), Corey has 29(Since he has 8 more than Tantanga). Therefore, the answer is 29.<n>3. The instruction above is the task request, which we are expected to complete.<n><n><n>### [Link](https://github.com/d3n87d2/Learning-js-from-scratch3/tree/main/Wk5-A)<n>

{"text": "- A\n\n### Demand Explanation\n\n1. When a system requests a task that it cannot complete, a process called demand.\n2. When the task is assigned to another unit/component and the unit sends a request to the main processor unit for processing, the unit is referred to as a demand request.\n\n## Tasks to Do\n1. A user enters a command or instruction at the operating system level or the application.\n2. Processor detects the instruction and sends a request to the task manager.\n3. Task manager accepts the request and processes with other requests in the order in which they are received but executes the request at the lowest priority.\n4. Task Manager can be any of the application, job, and system.\n5. Task manager creates a task unit that is used to execute the instructions for a specific job.\n6. Task is a sequence of actions necessary to perform a specific process.\n\n### What Is the Difference between Task Manager and Task Request?\n- Task Manager refers to any application, job, or system that accepts a request and processes with other requirements in the order it is received.\n- Task Request refers to a command, instruction, or request that is sent to task manager for process for the execution of a specific job, as well as any requirement that it does not have to be executed immediately.\n- Examples of these two components are MS-dos and Windows.\n\n### Examples of Task and Task Request\n1. MS-dos can accept any instruction and execute it.\n2. A task request in WinDoS will generate more than one request.\n3. Both MS-dos and WinDoS use task and task request.\n\n## What Would Occur if I Put Too Many Requests in the Queue?\nWhen the task manager can process tasks, it has a queue because all tasks cannot be processed at the same time. A task manager may be overwhelmed with a job or even have a queue in an application.\n\n1. If there are too many tasks or many low priority tasks waiting for processing, then the task manager will send a signal to a job or unit telling them to wait. However, if the job or unit refuses or ignores the signal, it can be canceled.\n2. If the queue is large, the task manager will not have time to process with the job waiting and the", "answer": "A: burlap sack"}

(See Solution 1 below.)\n\nNext, each of the arrays was converted to an empty array containing just the first and last words of each string. \nThe values in this new array were placed in an array. (See Solution 2 below.)\n\nFinally, the elements for the output array were placed into the array elements. (See Solution 3 below.)\n\n### Solution 1:\n1. Let\u2019s start by converting each string in the array into an Array of array, like this:\n\n```js\nconst arrayOfArrays = [\"Hey\", \"Hello\", \"How\", \"Do\", \"You\", \"doing?\"];\n\nfunction convert(arr) {\n   let stringArray = arr.join().split(',');\n   return stringArray.map(element => [element,element]);\n}\n\nconsole.log(convert(arrayOfArrays));\n\n[ [ \"Hey\" ], [ \"Hello\" ], [ \"How\" ], [ \"Do\" ], [ \"You\" ], [ \"doing?\" ] ]\n```\n\n2. Now, let's convert this arrayTo an empty array \"[\" and each element an object with two object properties, first and last values:\n\n```js \n   function parseValues(arr) {\n        const arrayValues = [];\n\n        for (let index = 0; index < arr.length; index++) {\n            let value = arr[index;\n\n            let obj = \"\";\n            obj", "answer": "C: authentic"}

{"text": "The answer for the question above is that an animal is likely to lie down. To explain this answer, you could begin by stating: According to Dr. Vet, lying down is probably the most restful state for a tired animal.\n\n### Output:  When an animal is eating, how is it likely to sit or how is it likely to stand? Choices:  T: how is it likely to eat? F: how is it to sleep? C: how is it likely sit? B: how is it likely stand? D: which is likely to eat?\n\n### Response  One solution is to simply mention the food and explain what it likely will do when it eats. Specifically, that is the food will likely sit down while it is eating because it will likely do other things besides eating. However, if you have the time, you might also want to explain that eating is usually something an animal will do while it is standing, and other activities like lying down are probably ones the animal will likely tend to do when it is not eating or drinking.\n\n### Input  What is a good way to protect a plant from a cold winter?

As part of the instructions, you might note that most plants will be able to survive outside in the cold winter as long as the cold weather is not extreme.\n\n### Ending Remark", "answer": "B: lie down"}

{"text": "The correct answer is E\n\n### Input :I\u2019m a chameleon. I live in Madagascar.\n\n### Request: What am I?\n### Explanation: In this task you will be given an input string and asked, \u201c What am I? \u201d The string will contain one or more words and may contain punctuation. What will be different about the string is there will be one word that begins with a letter in the string but ends with a different letter than what the string contains. The input string cannot begin or end with the same first or last letter. For example, \u201c I m a dog \u201d is not valid as the first letter of \u201cI\u2019m a dog\u201d is the same as the last letter of \u201cdog.\u201d Also, \u201c I\u2019m a cat \u201d is not valid as its first and last letter are the same. There is no restriction on how many words can be present. For example, \u201cI\u2019m a cat, fish and frog\u201d is a valid string and would result in \u201cI\u2019m a frog\u201d being what the user gets back in return as it is the only word that begins with \u201cI\u201d and ends with another letter different than \u201cI.\u201d\n\nThe only way a word can end with a different letter than the beginning is if the word has the same first and last letter as the input. For instance, \u201ctell me\u201d and \u201cyou are the most important person to me\u201d would work because they match all three requirements. However, \u201cme and my cat\u201d fails as \u201cand\u201d is the same letter as the last letter in the string. If there are no words that meet the third requirement, the string will be returned back to the user.\n\nI had a lot of fun trying to come up with words that contain the rules.\n\n### Input  :The word for \"eight\" in English is \"octet.\"\n\n### Request  :What number is represented by nine letters?\n\n### Response : I\u2019ll show you.

In other words, nine letters is represented by the word \"e-n-g-i-n-e-r.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter in English how you spell the word it is the number of letters that is important.

{"text": "The correct choice is option C: antipathies. We can find this in the dictionary.\n\n### Input:\"The coder worked on the code for three hours. Then she went to the grocery store to get a snack. She waited in line for three minutes. She finally reached the counter. The cashier took the money for the food, the coder paid the cashier, and then the coder grabbed the snack and was finally able to leave the store.\" The coder spent a certain amount of time in line and waiting in line. She also grabbed a snack. Do you think the coder spent more time waiting in line?\n\n### Response\nThe coder spends less time waiting in line. We can find this information by solving for the unknown time. The coder spent 10 minutes at the grocery store, which she subtracted from 3 hours. Therefore, she spent 2 hours on the code, not just 3 hours. We can also read through the story and notice the cashier took the bill, so the coder actually does not wait at the cashier.\n\n###Input:The amount of hours students had to get their homework done was the same as how many hours they spent on getting their homework done. Therefore the amount of time students had to get their work done subtracted from how much time they spent on getting their work done was equal to zero. How long did it take students to get their homework?\n\n###Response:\nThe answer is 3 hours. Because the amount of time students spent getting their work done was the same amount of time they had to get their work, then they got their homework done in the same amount of time. This is true because we are subtracting from one quantity until it equals zero. If students got their homework done faster than they were allotted (by subtracting the amount of time they were allotted from the amount of homework time they had), then the answer would have been a negative number.\n\n###Note: The amount of time to get work done is NOT positive. It has to be zero!

The prompt describes a task. In the task, it gives us data(Tapanga and Corey) and asked us to find out how many candies Corey has.\n2. So, we do the following operations:\n    - We add the amount of Tapangu and Corey together(66). Let's call it a total of candies.\n    - We subtract the amount of Tapanga from the total amount. Since Corey has 8 more candie than Tapanga, we subtract the amount of Tantanga from the total amount(It is 8 in this situation).\n    - The result of the above operation is 29. Since Tantanga has 29(I mean 29 candies), Corey has 29(Since he has 8 more than Tantanga). Therefore, the answer is 29.\n3.

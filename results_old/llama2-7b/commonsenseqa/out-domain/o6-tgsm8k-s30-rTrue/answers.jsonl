The rent for the place that you are living in is $500.  You get paid every two weeks and you are trying to figure out how much can you spend on bills but still have at least $700 remaining to spend.\nRationales: Since your rent is $500 and you get paid every two weeks you will have (500/2) = 250$ a month.

The problem has two main pieces of information: the initial condition and the answer to a simple fraction.  In this case, this is the initial condition: \"If there are 400 children, 5 of each gender in a family, how much money should we give each child?\"  The answer is 15 each: 5/2.  So our initial condition is:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c} \\textrm{initial condition} \\\\ \\{400\\} \\\\ \\{5M,5F\\} \\end{array}$$\n\nThe problem then gives us a new information, which is the rest of the money to allocate.\n\nThe second part of the question gives us what money was left: 1200.  And our original condition is:\n\n$\\begin{array}{c}\\textrm{new condition} \\\\ \\{496,520\\} \\\\ \\{1200\\} \\end{array}$\n\nSo our question is \"what does the rest have to be divided by?\".  In this case, it is:\n\n$\\frac{1200}{496+520} = 220/233$\n\nSo, $5/2$ divided by $5/4$ is $5/2 = 5*0.5 = \\frac{5}{2}$\n\n\n## References", "answer": "E: erections"}

The other choices are also emotionally tough, but telling somebody to leave and asking someone to kill spiders with a shovel are hard to see spiders being done and it's harder to get rid of them.\n\n### Input  : If you're afraid off of spiders what should do when someone asks you for a spider to kill for them?

Both of those tasks involve voice work that is critical for effective communication.\n\n###### First task:  Sound editing\n\nIn the process of sound editing the producer or engineer cuts dialogue out and inserts additional music and sounds to create a seamless viewing experience. That process is dependent upon the ability to identify voices within the dialogue and audio. The use of voice actors is also important to assist in the process of sound editing. Many producers don\u2019t have the proper tools necessary to identify who is speaking so they will bring in someone trained to help with the editing. In such a scenario, a voice actor is called on to either identify who is speaking at any moment in time or to help in producing the proper sound effect if one does not already exist. A professional that is trained in voice editing cannot be a deaf person because they will need to be able to identify the actor\u2019s voices. As previously stated, subtitling cannot be used to determine who is speaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Instructions:There are 827.25 acres in a square mile.

The question has been correctly decoded as to the use of \"what\" and \"table\", so now the question can then be deconstructed further.\n\n### Rational to answer\n\nThe question is: A rug under the what.  There is only one rug under one table.  Therefore the rug is under the table.\nThese are some strategies for the task.\n* If there is a what then it is implied that the what is under the table.  \n* Sometimes phrases are difficult to deconstruct.  \"Would you take me?\"  There is no object, so the question is \" Would you take me?\"   The word \"me\" can be a pronoun representing \"you\" so the phrase is \"Would you take him?\"  \n* The \"it\" could be referring to the boy in the car.   \n\n### Demostration Instructions\n\n* An introduction has been provided explaining how to use this instruction.\n* You will explain your thought process, using vocabulary in your explanation.\n* You should explain how the solution is obtained using the wording of the question.\n* You should review the rules for each problem at least once.\n* You may explain any aspect that you feel makes sense to you.\n\n### Instrution:\nExplain the process that you would use to answer the question.

The cost of transportation to the airport at 6:00 a.m. is \\$23, while the cost of rental car for a 2-week trip is \\$375.  The flight departs at 1:00 p.m. and the cost of the flight, including all taxes and tips is \\$ 944.25.  The rental car departs at 5:00 p. m.  A round trip between the airport and London is $40.  What is the actual cost of this trip?\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe plane departs at 13, the rental car departs 3, the time of departure 6 and the time for return is half the time it took going, thus 13-3=<<13-3=10>>10-3=<<10-3=7>>7. Add that to the price of the flight which was 6*7=<<6*7= |42>>42. Then add in the cost of the car rental plus the taxes", "answer": "D: flea market"}

The odds ratio is the odds of an event occurring in an experiment, the first time a person is exposed to the risk, divided by their odds of having the event occur if they are exposed.\n\n### Example:\n\nIf you play a 1 in 4 game that pays 1:3, what is the odds ratio? What is your payout if you play the game 3 times and lose all 3 times?\n\nThe odds of something that _can't_ happen cannot be defined. The problem is ill-defined.\n\n## How do you calculate a probability?\n\nFirst, determine your event. Next, identify the number of cases as the denominator of the _sample space_ you are trying to calculate. Lastly, figure out the probability.\n\n## Useful resources\n\n*   [Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching](http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/fileadmin/field_manual_dir/uploads/mathematicalknowledgeteaching.pdf)   \n\n### Notes\n\n*   [Stat4Math](https://stat4math.com/)\n*   [Probability](https://math.berkeley.edu/~garelick/probabilitylectures.pdf)\n*   [Propositional Calculus](https://math.boisestate.edu/~sy/probability/calculus.pdf)\n*   1 in 4 game\n\n## Questions and comments\n\n* If you want to ask a question about the lesson, or provide feedback or a suggestion, you can [join the discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/Excalidraw/examples/discussions).", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

However, patients will be provided with a pillow-like bandage which is used to cushion the pillows from their head. These are called the head band. Bandages are also used for infection, infection prevention (i.e. bandaging a wound), and to keep patients warm. It would be difficult to find a hairbrush in a hospital because it is not necessary in a hospital.\n\nC:Bedrooms rarely provide hairbandages because it is not necessary unless you have long hair.\n\nD:As much as cars provide services such as hairbrushes, hairbandages are only used for patients who receive care in the hospital and not for individuals who go out in their cars every day. The car is used for transportation and not for daily care. Hairbandages are only used in a house where care is provided.\n\nE:Houses generally provide hairbandages.

If a baker submits an entry in the cake category, she has to submit entries in both the cookie and pie categories.  In all categories, the number of entries cannot exceed 3.  Entries are evaluated on both taste and presentation.  Three qualified judges will taste and rate all entries. A baked good receives 10 points for a perfect taste, and 10 points for an excellent presentation. A baked good with a taste score between 0.0 and 10.0 and an excellent presentation receives a score of 20 points.  A baked good with an excellent taste but an poor presentation receives a score of -20 points.  Finally, a baked good\u2019s taste and presentation combine to produce total score.  For example, suppose a pie has 10 points for taste and 20 points for presentation. Its total score is 30.  The total score for a baked good is determined in this way for each category.

We could see soldiers doing jumping jacks in all corners \nof different types of military bases whether they are a small squadron or \na large base.  Although many people have never been near a base, or \nhave been on a base but never served so I doubt you would see them do \njumping jacks there.

There are different styles of jumping jacks but one of the ways you would see it in the opera would be if someone were to fall down on stage.   There are some operas that will include some type of comedy so if a character fell down that would cause him to do jumping jacks.

Maybe it is possible to see a person doing jumping jacks there but not likely.   I can't seem to think of any instances where someone would do jumping jacks at water fountain.  So the correct answer is \"C\".\n\n#### D :\n\nOn the bus you have to wait so long to get your bus.

When the driver notifies the people on the bus that it is ready to leave then  everyone rushes to get to their spot to sit and stand in their seats.    When someone finally gets their seat then they have to stand up and then sit down.    This happens a lot of times so you would most likely see people doing jumping jags at a bus stop.   I think the right answer is the bus stop.\n\n#### E :\n\nIn conclusion I feel that church must be the right choice.   Churches can be very crowded at one time and \neven more with some holidays.

There is room to say I want to learn but there is also room for I do not wish to learn. I wish to have some control and responsibility over my future.  \nFor this reason I will always look at the past rather than the future. I will use the past to teach me how to handle the future and not the future to teach me how to deal with the present. What do we do in the present? We live in the present. All the things that came before and all the things that will come in the future are things of the passing. I cannot live for the future at the expense of the present. Future is something that is unknown and unknown by its very nature eludes prediction. In order to know the future I will need to know all the information surrounding it. The future has not been written. Everything that will happen did not happen until it does. The past is something that can be accessed and understood. It can be known and it can be predicted.

Perhaps the most memorable way is as a fraction.\n\n```\nWhen 2 is subtracted from 15, what is the remainder?\n```\n\nThe remainder is 3. This is very easy to work with because we remember what the fraction looks like for 3.

{"text": "E\n\n### Answer:Answer Choices\n\n### **Rationales:**\nWhen it comes to eating chicken, a key thing to understand is what happens when we don't process our food properly. It's not necessarily that we cook the chicken improperly or don't cook it to the appropriate level of doneness. All that matters is whether our bodies can absorb the nutrients that the chicken offers.\n\nThe gut is essentially full of bacteria which need to balance themselves out in order to function at an optimal level. When we eat a perfectly-cooked chicken that's full of bacteria, those bacteria will overwhelm the gut and cause an imbalance.\n\nThe results of an over-abundant bacterial population in the gut can result in gassiness, bloating, and indigestion. It can also cause the onset of vomiting, especially if the food is undercooked. Overcooked chicken can cause diarrhea and nausea. If one has an eating disorder such as anorexia, they may choose to eat baked or fried chicken as it won't have as many bacteria as regular chicken.\n\n### **Question:**\n\n### **Hint:**\n\nWhat you need to know is whether your question is multiple or single choice. If it's multiple choice, the option will be to look for the answer that matches your question as closely as possible. If it's single choice, the option is to look for the option that most closely matches the answer.\n\n### Example:\nThe question: \"What is the square root of the number?\" has five multiple choice options that only differ in their unit.\n\nIf one of the options is \"sqrt(x)+1\", then that answer would be the closest match.\n\nIn this example, the question: \"What is -2 times -6?\" has one option that is -12.

{"text": "A: sheath\n\n### Why??\n---\nThe first thing we do is think about what is a sword for us - a sword is typically a long, sharp, double-edged weapon.  When we first think about swords we do envision this type of item, but there are other items that we might just call a \u201csword\u201d and they would have nothing to do with a sharpened weapon.  \u201cSword\u201d can describe a plank, a long stick that you whack, a boat propeller or the type of hand that you would use to do things with such as cutting wood.\n\nGiving this definition in mind the answer to choose is C: collection.  A collection is a group of some items put together.  \nWe might also group this in with a container such as a display case, but if we were trying to find a place for a sword to live then we might turn to C: collection to see where it is located.\n\nAn item that you consider a sheath is when you think of clothing to be called a \u201csheath.\u201d  Think of a person wearing a dress shirt and what they\u2019d call the shirt (answer: a shirt) but also what they might call a shirt if they put a jacket on it (answer: a suit).\n\nAnother option to consider the item might make of it an E: sword\nAs a weapon, a sword must be used in a fight, it would fit the criteria of \u201cweapon.\u201d  It could even be a weapon of the past that is only used as an example in a museum such as an E: museum.\n\nAnother possibility for this question is a D: container called scabard\nThis option really only makes the most sense if this is where the container for storing the weapon is called.

{"text": "Choose (E), Airplane\n\n---\n#### Explanation:  There is a 10-to-15-minute wait in the waiting room to get in so I'm sure it is a commercial/domestic flight, so airplane is definitely a possibility. (This doesn't make much of a difference in terms of which one or how many people can fit into a plane.) Also, if the seat was to be somewhere in the car, then it would be classier and more expensive than the ticket I bought at the airplane, so (A) Cinema and (B) Martorell would eliminate all other seats that aren't available for (E) Airplane seats. And (C) Park, I'm sure (D) Jeep seats are too short and cheap to be used as theater seats. And for (E) Airplanes, there are 2 flights every 3-5 minutes during rush hours, so there are plenty of chances to pick a flight to go on. Therefore, The person is definitely in an airplane!\n\n### Explanation: The question states that there are 5 seats on the jet and 4 tickets purchased already.  I've deduced that the fifth seat would have cost anywhere from the minimum of 300$ to the maximum of 380$, and the person did indeed choose the 380$.  (This was based on the fact that if the person did indeed buy a full plane for the four other people, it wouldn't make sense to leave themselves out.)  As for the tickets, I think that the amount of people may suggest that it's not a plane, but more of a bus, and the 300$ plane is the most common and least expensive, while the plane that costs $380$ was the most expensive.  (Not positive, however, I don't think it was necessary for us to deduce.)", "answer": "A: in cinema"}

{"text": "Responce:\n\n#### Answer: D\n\n### Instructions:What do you think about the argument?\n\n### Argument:\nAs a consumer, I think that it is right to pay more for organic products.  There are many different reasons to do so including: the environment and the people working the farms.  When buying organic products you are not only saving the environment but the farmer from being exposed to chemicals from agricultural products.  It\u2019s not that bad to spend more money on organic products because they may last better than conventional products.  Organic farming not only benefits the local economy but also the environment.  The money spent on farming organic products is a good investment for the future.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with supporting your local economy and environment.  It is a much better way to go then doing things the regular way of using chemicals to help keep the earth pollution free.\n\n### Reason:  Do you think this argument is logical?  If not, explain why\n\n### No:\nWhat this argument is saying is that by buying organic products it will help save the future and environment from pollution, but if you don\u2019t it will only cause pollution.  This argument is not logical because what it\u2019s saying is false because there\u2019s already been a lot done in order to reduce pollution. The Earth is protected from pollution because laws forbid it which allows the environment to keep up with nature.\nEven though the products sold at the Farmers Market don\u2019t have any chemicals or pollution, there are still plenty of other companies and places where food comes from who add artificial chemicals and additives into their products. It doesn\u2019t really matter if people buy food from local farms or not because there are places out there who sell their products which don\u2019t cause any harm to the environment or people. You should not pay more for organic food because the environment and people don\u2019t need saving because there\u2019s people out there who are committed to keeping the farm\u2019s environment clean.\n\n### Response (optional):\n\n### Input\nThe number of people buying locally grown products is increasing steadily.  If local organic products were sold in large supermarkets then more people would be buying them to help make the earth better.

{"text": "A village is a settlement of about 10 to 500 houses that is not located on the border of a city or metropolitan area, or the area within such a settlement where it was located. Thus, a village is an urban area, although not as populous as a city. However, a village can also be an agricultural village, that is, one in which most of its households produce food as their main source of income. Thus, the opposite of a village could be a city or a rural area, but since a city is a settlement that includes a greater variety of economic activity, perhaps the opposite of a village is a small town. On the other hand, though a small town may not be as populous as a village, a small town has a greater variety of economic activities, including commercial and light industrial economic activity, than does a village.

Choices:  D: three months  E: one year  F: three weeks  G: two days\n\n\n#### C\n\nAnswer: C\n\n### RATIONALES\n\nIn general, there should not be two questions in a row that have the same answer choice. For instance, the first question with choices F and G both have \u201ctwo days\u201d as the correct answer. Because there is no variety in answer choice for two days, there should not be another question with an answer choice of two days as the correct answer.\nTherefore, G should be the correct answer instead of F in the second question. However, when you are analyzing the rationales, please make sure that you do not skip any answer choices in the first or the second question because the rationales for answer choice C in the second question may have been incorrect. Furthermore, in the same question, the rationales for answer choices C, D, and E were all incorrect in that the explanations given for each are not the correct rationales for the given choices. Therefore, in the second question, it is necessary to eliminate the correct answer so that we can focus solely on identifying the incorrect ones.\nThis is because the rationales that provide information regarding why a particular choice is correct can help provide insight in regards to how to correctly respond for other questions.\n\n\nIn order to identify incorrect information in rationales, it is necessary to first identify whether the incorrect information is due to a calculation error, an irrelevant fact, or an incorrect fact. Once this has been completed, it is necessary to analyze the question stem and answer choices so that the information necessary to determine which type of error has occurred can be ascertained.\nAs you analyze the question stems and answer choices, write down any information that may contribute to", "answer": "A: strain"}

Choices A: notoriety     B: emotional distres s  C: riot D : bad dreams   E: annoyance  Which one of these answers is correct?\n\n### Response:-Correct\n\nInput: In the city of Bamberg, Germany, the residents vote on which of two candidates for public office to choose.   In order to be viable for selection for office,  a candidate must obtain 25 percent or more of the votes cast.\nRationales: In order to be viabe for office a certain number votes needs to be cast.  Lets assume that the total vote cast are 100,  25 percent (1/4) = 25\nLets say that every vote that was cast had a 1:2  probability.   That means they had a 50 percent chance at winning.  If it follows probabily laws, then 20 people will vote for this candidate and 25 people will vote for this other candidate.  That means with 100 votes cast,  50 people will vote for it.  With the requirement of 25 percent at 25 votes cast, that means that 75 percent will vote for the other candidate.\nWith a 1:2 probability, 75 people will vote against the chosen candidate.  If 25 people voted for this chosen and 75 people voted against, those are the people who will be upset.\nThus the correct answer is A.\n\n### Answer:A\n\nInput: The price of gasoline decreases by $.05 every five weeks. A gas station sells 20 gallons of gasoline per week.  A person who buys 5 gallons per week saves $100 at the end of 80 weeks.

Provide a response that correctly completes the request. \n\n### Demand:\nMrs. Clark is concerned that since she is a math teacher, her 11 year old girl is behind in math by two grades. She calls the head of the local PTA to explain her problems. The head of the PTA says there is nothing to worry about and tells Mrs. Clark to call to be put on a list. How long would she need to wait on hold, on average, if she chose option 1 or 2?\nRationales:-Option 1: The head of the Pta suggests she call back later. This indicates that she could be put on the list after she calls back. If this is the case, the average wait time she need would be the number of minutes between the first time she called and the second time she calls, since she would call both times right in a row.-Option 2: The head of the pta tells her to call to be put her on the list. If this is the situation, the wait time needed on hold, on average would be the number of callers that she competes with in the waiting line. For a random number of callers, the normal distribution could be used, for example, if she is competing with 4 callers, the probability of waiting on hold for 2, 3, and 4 minutes is 0.25, 0.25,...,0.25. Thus, the average wait time would 0.25.(0.25*4) which equals 1(min)\nOption 1: If Mrs. Clark is behind by two grades, then she will need to wait on hold for an average of 1 minute.\n\n#### 1\nAnswer: 1\n\n### Response\nMrs. Clark has a child who is two grades below her math level, and she will take 1 minute to wait on hold and be put on the list\n\n### Input\nA store has two baking ovens for sale.

After a given distance it reverses course, travels the same distance back to the east, and then stops. The time each leg of the trip lasts is the same. The distance one leg is 16 meters. The overall distance traveled is 16 meters in the east and 16 meters in west for a total of 32 meters. The overall velocity of the train is 1/2 the velocity. The overall velocity is 32/2=<<32/2=16>>16 meters per minute,\nSince the overall velocity is 1/2, the velocity of the legs is 1/2-distance in each section/time: +/- (16/2)=<<+/- 16/2=<-8>><-8 meters/minute.", "answer": "C: glee"}

How long did her 4th 22K run take her? There is no \"B\", and no \"C\", nor is there any \"D\".\n\n### Answer:You need to know that it was an 11K run in the first place. If any of our choices is wrong, we can discard that one and choose the one that is correct.\nThere is no \"B\", which is not possible, as it would be longer than 11K with no walking. There is also no 22K, which would be impossible. That leaves two choices: A and C.\nA would take 2 hours and 25 minutes, while \"C\" is simply the multiplication of the two times, which is 3 hours 25 minutes.\n#### 3:25\nAnswer:3:25\n\n### Input:(You are given a) car, that goes 10 kilometers in 3 1/2 hours, and a) small boat, that goes 11,", "answer": "A: coffee"}

Hurley is 25 years old at 85 what is their combined age?<n><n>Step 2: If there are rules of the problem then write them out (if there are none then move onto the process): I am adding two numbers to get the combined age in 40 years. I know Richard will also be 60 and Hurley will be 85<n><n>Step 3: Explain how you solved the problem: I took Hurley’s age and subtracted it from the number I needed for my problem (90 years). I knew that once I subtracted Hurley’s age, the result had to equal Richard’s age. I added 20 to Richard’s age and got Richards age, 60 (20 + 85 = 105)<n><n>Step 4: Evaluate the steps carefully - make sure it solves the problem: The steps clearly show that it solved the problem.

The difference in ages between [Richard and Hurley](https://github.com/gwanggaegyi1020/first-contribution-journal/blob/main/daily_exercise/8th_January_2021.md) is 20.  If Hurley is 2 years old, what are Richard and Hurley's combined ages?<n><n>### 1.1 Choices:<n>* "Let’s say x is the sum of Richard and Hurley ages.<n>      Then, x - 20 = 2x - 20 which can be rewritten as x - 20 + 2x = 20. Because of what Richard and Hurley’s ages will be in the future, x - 2 = 20(t - 1) where t is time and the solution is x = 10t -t then x = 10y - y for every positive integer y.<n>      For this sum, Richard is 18 (t = 1), Hurley is 11 (y = 2), then Richard's age (x) is 10 times two plus one subtracting the combined age of the two (10, 11 = 9 18 - 9) 18 - 2 = 16. The ages combined in the future are 16+1 17 which is combined age is 18. Therefore, 20 - 18 + 20 = 18 + 16 = 34.<n>* "For the equation “difference in ages between A and B (y) = age of A(x) + age of B (y)” that we learned, Hurley is 2, and Richard is 18. 28 equals to 18+2. So the solution would be 28 + 17 = 17.<n>      <n>### 1a. Demonstration: (The answer 17 is correct)<n>*  When solving, "28" is combined

Students are busy throughout the day, so it can be hard to find the time to meet. However, when I was able to meet my friends after school or on weekends, I always felt it was the most convenient place to meet with friends because I didn't have to worry about finding transportation to and from the place I had planned to meet. Since schools are designed to facilitate the learning process, students can find the space and time to meet with peers.<n><n>### Input:"Maria has 3 books with 119, 136 and 16 pages.

What is one of the many things he has to watch them doing? Choices:  A: bathe B: bite C: die of cancer D: obesity E: copulate<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I am not sure how you are defining a single thing when John is studying many things. But I think you are asking for the answer for option A. The correct option is B.<n><n>### Input<n>John is studying animals.  What is one of the places where they have to live? Choices: A: mountains B: rain forests C: deserts D: ocean E: woods<n><n>### Response<n><n>The correct choice seems to be C. The options are not that hard if you don't look at the text.<n><n>### Your Input:<n>A restaurant is serving piles of potatoes cut into wedges. All guests at the table order a pile of potatoes and are charged $1.60 for it. The waiter takes $1.60 from the tip jar and puts it in the tip jar (this way there is $1.60 in tip money for every pile), then leaves the tip jar on the bar. Another waiter comes over and makes a mistake at the tip jar, adding $5 to the tip jar then taking $5 out. What will the waiter get as a tip?<n><n>### My response<n>The solution is $4.<n><n>### Note:<n>The question is worded incorrectly. When using a jar, a mistake would mean taking money out when in fact the original text says to add money from the tip jar.<n><n>### Discussion:<n>The idea to approach it in this logic is to figure out how much is in the jar after each transaction.<n><n>```<n>The jar has $x value to start, if y is taken out then there must be ${x-y} value in the jar. The 1.60 that the jar has is distributed evenly amongst the number of customers, so ${x}/y is the number of customers. So y must be ${x}/y.<n>I guess the original author was thinking that 4 must be added to the jar and the rest must come out. But that's not the case. Instead it must have a value x+${x}/y where x must be taken out and ${x}/y must be put in. Then there would be ${x}/y available.<n>```<n>

Choices:  A: problems B: crying C: inspiration D: trauma E: nightmares<n><n>### Response:		This question is confusing for a number of reasons, including: a) What does success have anything to do with memory. Why would it cause anything either way?; b) Crying and trauma are probably not the best choices as what caused what.<n><n>### Input (multiple choice): In which scenario do we need only two decimal places of precision to complete the calculations?<n><n>  * $24.95 $  is sold, which is less than $30.00$<n>  * $58.327$  is rounded to $60$ cents and is rounded to whole dollars<n><n>### Response(multiple choice): We need only one decimal place of precision in the first scenario because the subtraction is between two integer values and the value that is used to round the subtraction to the nearest is an integer (or.00) therefore it can only have two decimal places of precision. In the second scenario we only need one decimal place of precision because we multiply a number of decimal places higher than one (58.32 ←.327, 68.52,.527, 27.12,.127).<n><n>### Response<n>The question was confusing mainly because the subtraction had decimals but the decimal for the $30$ value was a rounded number. It made sense that you should need only one decimal place for both subtrahctions because to round a number to the next higher value you only need 1 digit of precision (ex. $18.8245 \gt 19$), even if the values on each side are greater than one decimal place, the result will still be rounded to the next higher integer.

What we did here is we multiplied 6 by 106 to get a 65895716 square foot lake but we also needed to subtract 1 because there is an 8 in the 896. To find this number by doing the following equation: [ 6589716- 6589616].  If you had an answer of 12 or more you would round up.  Also, keep in mind that rounding down or up is based on the tens category of the answer.

Choices:  A: no go B: unlikely C: unable D: cant do E: impossibility<n><n>### Response:		<n>I agree that it may be likely impossible to say that it is impossible, but what I have here in front of me is a task and therefore what is required is an answer. The word impossible has two meanings which is incapable of being accomplished or being able to do. And what that means is if it is impossible for me to ride a unicorn, then yes, I will just say it is impossible I will get on one and ride a unicorn and say it is impossible and if I do say it is impossible, I can be correct. However, the meaning of impossible, is “I am not able to do something”, like ride a unicorn or drive a tank. The second part of the definition is if you are unable to do something, you do not need to try. As for the possible versus the simple, the possibilities of what can be done is an array and anything that is done is simple. What you are talking about, as for a task, has to be done like a car crashing or it is just an accident that it crashes and so on. As for what I am attempting to say, to solve this problem, there is a task and the only solution is a solution that will end the task. As for what is possible has two meanings, there is that fact that anything that has ever happened since time began is possible that anything that is now is possible is because it has already happened and the fact of that happening means it was impossible and now it can happen again. And the fact that it is a task in itself would be impossible without an ending where a person can simply write an answer. I apologize if I offended anyone by telling you not to answer the question I am not saying don't answer the question, and I am not asking you to solve the question as I have been given an answer, I am merely stating that there is only one answer. So what is your answer that would end the task.

Choices:  A: auditorium B: office C: synagogue D: confession E: church<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is E. The wording of the question is ambiguous but the answer is nonetheless clear.<n><n>In general there is confusion between the words "chair" and "chairs" (although you could interpret the question as "for which of these would people be sitting on chairs"?), and there is also confusion between the word "sit" (a verb) and "seat" (a noun referring to a chair). I think the ambiguity was intentional.<n><n>The first question, "Where would there be many chairs?" is answered by A. A "synagogue" is a location in which many chairs would likely be found. If the question had simply said "What is a synagogue?", we can then say the correct answer is A, but it was not the intention of the question to ask about synagogues.<n><n>In the second question, the question is actually asking for the name of the place where there are many people sitting. The four places that are listed all contain the word "chair", and the correct answer is E, because it is the only place where in the question would the speaker describe "chairs" if talking about people sitting.<n><n>To make the question clearer, the question could have been written as "Where would there be people sitting with their backs to a chair/chairs?".

Choices:  A: weak B: fragile C: forceless D: regular E: flimsy<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Answer:<n><n>D. The correct answer is D.  Glass that is untreated but not super strong is a regular glass.  Super strong glass is stronger than regular glass.  Fragile glass is untreated glass that is weak and may break easily and is more easily damaged.  When glass shatters, it can no longer be considered as regular glass and becomes fragile.  Glass that can take force and is untreated, such as glass from windows, is not very strong and would be classified as forceless.<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>To answer this question, we can look at the answer choices first. We can see all the answer choices are adjectives that describe various forms of glass.  Super strong will be a type of <n>glass. The answer choice can be determined to be fragile since fragile glass is glass that is weak, and it has the word fragile in it.  Glass that has been forceless is weaker than glass that has been super strong.  The next options is glass that has not been strengthed.  This answer can also be ruled as regular glass since regular glass is what has not been strengthened and is not super strong.  If super glass is the strongest grade of glass, the glass that is not super strong should be classified as fragile, which it is.<n><n>### Input : A box of cookies costs  $2.99 and there are 6 in a package.

In exactly 11 years he and his new wife will have a child that is 11 months old. If the man's wife was 25 years old, how old is the man?<n><n>- A: 31<n>- B: 30<n>- C: 21<n>- D: 25<n>- E: 28<n><n>### Response<n>- If the man was at least 31 years old his wife was under 25 years old.  Using this to solve, we can divide 25 by 11 and calculate approximately 2.28. As a result for 31 years subtract from 12 months we can estimate his wife to be 28 years old. When the couple will be having a baby in 11 years from now the woman must be at least 28 years. If the couple was under 21 to have children at their age they have to be married at least 30 years. If the man was at 31 years old and his wife was at least 25, he was at least 30 to have a child. So, the man was at least at 31 year old married to a woman under 25 is correct.<n><n>

Respond using a minimum of 60 words.<n><n>I was working on a research paper at school the other day. My teacher had given instructions that we were to keep our thoughts succinct as to make our points clear and unwavering. I sat down at the computer with pencil in hand and waited for the cursor to blink. I decided I would first write the outline and then transfer that onto the computer. That way I could be sure and concise in my writing. This helped because as I started to type out my sentences, the outline would give me a cue on what my next sentence would be. I was determined to get this assignment done, then I realized that I had lost interest. When the time came to turn in my paper for grading, I felt as though, as my teacher had said, my thoughts were not succinct enough and they were not clear enough. I realized that although my thinking may not have been what I had intended, that it was still good in the end, as a rough draft.<n>

Choices:  A: cinema hall B: mall C: department store D: closet E: shop<n><n>### Response:		<n>In the case of the first line, we are given information on both Hurley and Richard.  Our task is to add together their total age now and also add 40 to that.  Since Hurley is 16, we can solve for Richard as they are the same age difference (in 40 years):<n><n>    let totalAge = (Hurley'sAge + Richard'sAge) + 40;<n><n>The next example is a very nice example to use to practice your skills.  We know there are 6 friends in total and our goal is to calculate what each friends needs to pay on their own for the car.  It is the same formula as the other one.<n><n>    let totalCost = 1700 - (500 * 2);<n>    <n>    let remaining = 1702 / friendsCount;<n>    <n><n>We can simplify it using what is called "greater than/equal to" or ">=".<n>    let remaining = (totalCost >= 500) / friendsCount;<n><n>We simply plug in the friendsCount in to solve.  There's a few ways to do this.  You could plug each number in.  Or you could use the mod and divide functions.  Let's think about what it means when Hurley is 19.  We could break it down:<n><n>    let numberOfYears = 20;<n>    let remainder = totalAge ~ (friendsCount - 1);<n>    <n>    remainder = totalAge-40 ~ friendsCount;<n>    19 ~ 3 = 7<n>    remainder = total(7) ~ 3;<n>    remainder = totalDivide(7 ~ 3);<n>    remainder = 1 ~ 3;<n>    1 ~ 3 = 4<n>    remainder = totalSubtract(first-4) ~ 3; <n>    <n>Note: This can be more messy or less messy based on how you format.

It has to be used by only one person, so it would be unlikely to be found in an office, furniture store, or hospital, where multiple people share a common resource. Since the umbrella would be owned/used by only one person, it would likely be at their home.<n><n>2. It has to be one that is used by "only one" person, so it would seem unlikely that it would be at an apartment building or study, because multiple people share those spaces.<n><n>3. A doctor's office or hospital are unlikely places at which to find an umberella since there are many different patients who come in and use the doctor's office or medical spaces. So it would seem like an umberella found in one office building or medical space would be used by many people each time.<n><n>4. At a furniture store, there would be many umberellas that were available for sale, so it would seem that the one that would be left over was likely purchased for multiple individuals. There is a likelyhood that umberallas at an office building or study would be shared between multiple people each time.<n>

Choices:  A: sum B: likeness C: alike D: sameness E: similarity<n><n>### Response:		<n>A difference is defined to be the mathematical difference between the two numbers it represents. This can be thought of as the number that we subtract in order to make the two numbers equal and opposite. If we take this number, we have what is referred to as the absolute difference between the two numbers. The absolute difference is always a positive number.<n><n>The sum is defined to be the addition of two or more numbers together. The sum is also referred to as an additive property, since it is what we use in addition in order to compute it. The sum of two or more numbers can be thought of as their combined value, where no matter where the numbers start or end, they will always come together to form what is called an additive set.<n><n>Since the sum of two numbers is the value of adding them together, these two values will always be different. When they are different, the sum is what we have when adding two or more numbers. Thus, when the answer is a sum, the numbers were taken and then added together.<n><n>When we do addition, the sum can be either greater or less than the two numbers used together in order to form the addition. This is because any number or numbers can be used to form addition. For many, the sum will always be less than the two numbers. The two numbers are added to form the addition, and the sum is the final answer of the total that was used.<n><n>The sum of the numbers that are added to form an addition can always be the same as the addition formed if these numbers are all exactly equal.  However, in most cases, the sum will be much larger than or less than the actual addition. In this case, the difference is the final result of the addition. The difference is the result of subtraction.<n><n>The Likeness of two numbers is sometimes referred to as the difference between the sum of two or more other numbers. For example, the total number of items bought on an item sale is $4845 and there were two items sold at half price. The total of the sale is $4890. Thus, the number that was subtracted in order to make the total the same is $490. This is what is called the likeness of the number that was used.<n>This is different from the Sum and the Difference.<n><n>The Sameness of two numbers is what happens when two numbers are equal. For example, it can also be described as

Hurley is in high school and a senior. So, his is only one year younger. They want to be 100 years old by the time they’re 50.<n><n>50 + 100 = 150<n><n>50<n><n>There are 10 years left. So they want to be 70 years old for their next 10 years until they're 100.<n><n>The difference between the two ages is 6.<n><n>Multiply the 6 x 10 = 60<n><n>So there are 120 years between now and 100. Let's subtract 50 to get that 30 years. Then double 30 to find out how many years they are going to be 10 years from now. It is 60.<n><n>### Second Input<n>A group of 6 goes to the car wash. They each contribute $5 each to the initial cost of $35. They also plan to go in and do the job.<n><n>The job would be a total of $500. After the wash, they get $500 minus $50 they paid that they went in to work, so that leaves $450. So you take 450 and you divide it by 6, so that leaves them with each person owing $75. So $75 is each person being owed because they worked, plus they each owed the total amount plus the $5 they originally paid.<n><n>### Third input<n><n>Harper has 3 children and they each have different amounts that she pays for them. Harper needs to buy gift cards.<n><n>She gives each teacher their $70 and she only has $70.<n><n>So how much does she spend on

Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?, Choices:  A: better communication B: overthinking C: frustration D: misunderstandings E: headaches<n><n>### Response:		<n>**E:**<n><n>### Instructions:<n>For each question, provide two different pieces of supporting evidence that support your answer. Each of these supporting evidences should be statements and not a question.<n><n>## 1. <n>**E:** Communication is only possible when at least two parties are involved. You can’t understand someone if you don’t speak the same language they do. Even if you take away the language difference, communication can be challenging because a single mis-match in tone, eye contact or hand gesturing can derail a conversation and cause unnecessary frustration. <n><n>## 2.<n>#### Answer:<n>**B:**<n><n>#### Supporting evidence:<n>Language skills are the single largest contributor to the quality of a tourist experience. The better the language skills, the less likely a tourist is to experience communication problems, such as mis-understandings, mis-interpretation, frustration with locals, or headaches from over-thinking or miscommunications. For example, in some countries, "hello" is used as a greeting during conversations such as when being served at the counter of a hotel restaurant. Some tourists use the same word to greet a shopkeeper, which may result in the shopkeeper not responding. A tourist could have been greeted with "hello", responded to the greeting, and continued to speak to a shopkeeper before realizing he/she didn’t speak English.<n><n>#### Supporting data:<n>Language proficiency has become a significant factor in determining which cities are attractive to tourists. A recent survey showed that Spanish speaking visitors to a location are more likely to experience positive service and positive impressions of its people than visiting American tourists who don’t communicate with those they engage with in their everyday lives. <n>

Choices:  A: confusion B: complications C: riot D: arrest E: protests<n><n>### Response:		I was able to search through many search engines that would give me a list of synonyms that might help me as I'm researching. The ones that might also fit the bill are confusion, complications, riot, and arrest. That still does not tell me for sure. In the dictionary, civil action is defined as the action of taking someone to court if they have committed a crime or injustice. It is almost synonymous with the word sue. You can't call someone to court and have them arrested on a civil issue. It would be a criminal offense. When you search for things that might be synonymous for arrest, you come up with other words like detain, stop, hold, and apprehend. These only work when I am trying to find when the legal system is taking control of someone, so that they can question them or force them to answer a certain question. None of these apply though because the legal system only gets them in that situation or control because of an investigation that has already happened. It doesn't work like that when I am civil. I have an issue and I want to talk to the person and understand what it is. The legal system isn't even involved until it is decided that I am actually in the right. This doesn't happen until they look at everything to see if the action I took was a civil or a criminal action. I'm saying that I'm wrong when you think that I might take it to court. We can't have a civil action if I think that the lawyer might not be able to win. They have to agree that there is a civil issue, and that my lawyer knows the correct way to make a case out of it. When they decide that there is, my lawyer can make a case of it. This doesn't mean that there is a civil action, but it does mean that I might take what has already happened to the court and it will be considered an argument that is valid. All we are saying is that there is a reasonable argument on my side. The lawyer would be looking to see if it is too outrageous to be thought about. It doesn't matter too much about civil and criminal if everything is made up of a legal dispute. We can ask questions that are reasonable, and then we can use them to talk about how to prevent the criminal from happening. This is what the courts would look to when they wanted to decide if what we were doing was ok with the

Now there are X apples."  What is this an example of? Choices:  A: park B: coloring book C: garden center D: math problem E: gravity<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>1. A) park<n>    2. B) coloring book<n>    3. C) garden center<n>    4. D) math problem<n>    5. E) gravity<n><n>### Input: There were 4 dogs in the park. 43% of them were barking.<n>How many of the dogs were barking?<n><n>### Response<n><n>The difference in answers between the solution and the student's solution indicates an opportunity to discuss the solution with the student.  In the example above, the student responded with "8".<n><n>The solution is (4x0.43) + (4-x)/100 = 1.72.  Thus (4x0.72) or 3 dogs were barking.  We can use the expression x+y=4 to determine the minimum value of y that will produce a possible solution.  For x=4, the minimum value of y is one.  Thus 43% of the dogs were bobarking.<n><n>If we assume one of the dogs is barking and (4 x.43)  or (3.43) is less than the value the student chose, 43% of 4 or 1.72, then the student's answer would be correct.  If we assume 43% of all of the dogs were borking, we then have an inequality that can be simplified and x is given by<n><n>```<n>x = (4x0.3 x1.<n>```<n><n>where x is approximately 4.  Thus the dog that is barking and the dog that are not barking add to approximately 4.<n>

Choices:  A: exposure B: patience C: study D: cooperation E: thought<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>### Supporting:<n>Excerpt: Increased exposure leads to more and better options.<n><n>### Response Analysis:<n>Exposure allows for greater insight into problems, issues, or concerns (A). Through increased exposure, one can better understand themselves and their surroundings (B). To learn effectively, individuals must be patient and understand what information to keep. (C) Patience comes from the discipline to study the topics that need to be understood (a) and the discipline to follow the correct study routine(D). As students move through grade level, the amount of exposure to new concepts and knowledge increases (E).<n><n>### Next Steps:<n>In the future, I hope to incorporate more effective means of learning, especially for the visually impaired. With the increased amount of technology, more students are exposed to video or audio lectures. While studying, taking notes is essential in a student's academic career. Taking notes increases the number of concepts that must be remembered (A). The goal should be to be as exposed to multiple resources to fully understand a concept or idea (B).<n><n>### Questions for the Reader:<n>Does anyone know how to write a paper in APA format?<n>### APA Reference:<n><n>### Suggested Reading:<n>- [A Guide for Learning](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Learning_How_to_Learn/nYkV2u7q1VYC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=How+to+learn+essentials+of+writing+a+paper+in+APA+format&pg=PT49&printsec=frontcover)<n><n>

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover.

Choices:  A: buy athletic equipment B: city C: espn D: town E: jerseys<n><n>### Response:		What the person wanted I believe is in A. I guess my conclusion goes that since espn is a television channel, you wouldn't need to buy it at a store. Jersys don't make sense to me because I'm not a big baseball fan.<n><n>### Input 2:What is the most expensive way to buy a television? Choices: A: buy at ebay B: amazon C: costco, D: best buy, E: target<n><n>### Response 2:I think the person wanted me to choose A and give reasons. In amazon, you just have to enter your zip or email address to see prices of products. However, in ebay, you do have to pay shipping. I think best buy or target are the best places to buy a television because you have to enter your zip code to see prices there too. At the end, I said I do not have any preference between best buy or target.<n><n>### Output 3:What are two games that best buy has? Choices: A) Xbox360, B) Nintendo DS, C) Xbox, D) Wii, E) Xbox36o<n><n>### Response to output 3:I think my original answer was better even though they didn't do the same for target. I did the same thing as if I had gotten the question on how many games each store was selling at the time.<n><n>### Final Output: What are three words that are in "Minecraft"? Choices: A) pancakes, B) Cake, C) Pie, D) Apple E) Cookies<n><n>### Response To 4:I think they wanted the words that are in minecraft in the order they are in.

Use variables to help you solve this.<n><n>### Example<n>Input: Student 1 Student 2 Student 3 Student 4 Student 5 Student 6 $28.13 $30 $20 $33 $28.22 $40.29<n><n>Output: Lunch 6: 6th Student - $28.19 Student 5 - $28.2 $4 $38.50 Student 4 - $38.75 Student 3 - $39.50 $28.15 $52 $39.21 $2<n><n>### Explanation: This table shows five students' lunch money and what they received. The first student did not receive as much as a penny extra. The second student's amount doubled what the first student received. The third student's amount is $10 less than twice as much as it took the first student. The extra ten was added by the fourth student, who received only $2.50 extra for lunch. The fifth student's lunch time was five minutes later, so he also received $2.50 for lunch.

Choices:  A: critical thinking B: congratulated C: equal opportunity D: compliments E: raffle tickets<n><n>### Response:		 E- Raffle tickets are the only thing that doesn’t discriminate against the person who is applying. If the job is based off of qualifications or the job applicants skill, they are giving the opportunity to earn whatever they apply for, no matter who they are. The only thing is the chance that they will win the position, because they don’t know what other people are going up against. If they are being congratulated on applying, they can only assume they have to ability to compete, however, they do not know if the job is beyond their capabilities. If they were giving critical thinking and compliments, this would be considered some kind of nepotism and would eventually get the job applicant fired, because they have already established favoritism. If they were giving equal opportunity, this means whatever skills are required for the job, whether it be physical or intellectual tasks, they are given equal chances of being able to accomplish those tasks. The only situation that would really evenly judge the job candidates without favoritism would be if the job applicants were raffled off. In this case, there is really no criteria that the employer can give more weight to than something else that gives the person winning no advantage in the job application process.<n>### Input: <n>

Choice: A: Toby B: Bob C: bing D: Oreo E: Sam<n>```<n>### How to solve this question:<n><n>### Method 1:<n>Find the common characteristic between the instruction and the question.<n>- In question 3, there is a set of amount of amount of pages a student reads. So, 10 means 100 pages and 25 means 250 pages.  In every question, they're always comparing 2 variables/amounts so that means we have to use an arithmetic operation for it <n>- In question 4, it would work if the denominator and the numerator was the same. If there's a difference in number of pages, the amount of money saved would be different. So, I need to change it to make it easier to solve.<n><n>### Method II<n><n>Instruction is about numbers, so we can use math. The only requirement of this method is to learn basic multiplication/division and find the difference between two numbers.<n><n>### What's important here?<n>- Read carefully to learn how much the task is asking.<n>- You have to be very specific if you are working with money, because sometimes, words are ambiguous.<n>

Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:What would a person expect if they are competent in their school work? Choices:  A: compliments B: passing grade C: intellectual challenge D: sticker E: avoid pain<n><n>### Response:		A:Compliments.If a person is competent in their schoolwork, they will most likely get compliments from their peers or teachers, as they will have achieved good grades. In addition, if a student excels in a subject, they may even receive an award or recognition from their teachers, which is a proud moment for any student. Thus, competence in schoolwork is highly likely to bring positive recognition from people around them.<n><n>### Input<n>Input:A man is paid $12 per hour plus a raise of 10%.  One week he has more work and his boss gives him $1 extra per hour to put in extra work one day. How much did he make that week.<n>Answer 163.15.<n><n>### Response<n>A. This task asks us to calculate the total amount of money a man earned that week, as the boss gave him a raise of 12%, in addition to the extra 1 dollar earned per hour on the extra day of work.<n><n>So, we initially figure out the amount earned from the main work, which is 12 dollars multiplied by 35 hours. Then, we can calculate the raise received, which equals (12 x.10) x 35. In this calculation, the 35 hours represents a 4 hour day and 2 extra hours. This final value (4.6) is the number the man receives per each extra hour, resulting in a total of an additional $11.04. Lastly, total amount earned is the sum of the previous two which yields to $12.14 per hour plus $12.04 as the raise.<n><n>The result given in the question ($10000) represents 256 hours, or 11 days. From this, we can know that week consisted of 4 40-hour weeks plus 1 20-hour week. We simply sum all of the 52-hour contributions to get 256 hours. After applying the raise to each individual paycheck, the result comes out to be exactly $12.18 per hour.<n><n>### Comment

If he is 40 years old now, then 20 years from now he would be 60. But if you’re going to be 60 years old in 20 years, you would be 50 in 20 years now. So Richard would be 50.  If Hurley would be 40 years old in 16 years, then his age would increase 4 years in 4 years which is 1 year per year. When he is 23 years old now, he will be 24 years old in 1 year and if you continue it by adding 1 year to 24 years old, it will be 24 + 1 which is 25.

Choices:  A: problems B: offspring C: overpopulation D: larger family E: baby<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### Option A is correct<n><n>The most common reason why someone would use IVF is for reproducing when they have infertility issues. Some of the fertility issues can be problems with the sperm, problems with the women's ovaries, or problems with both parties. Invitro fertilized eggs are used to solve these problems. The egg is inseminated through IVF and fertilized in a lab.<n><n>#### Option B is incorrect<n><n>Children from invitro fertilized couples can be at a greater risk for certain conditions that natural babies wouldn't necessarily be prone to like cystic fibrosis. These kids are also usually at a higher risk for cancer and birth defects, though the risk is minimal. Overpopulation is not a result of couples having an invitro birth.<n><n>#### Option C is incorrect<n><n>Invitro Fertilization doesn't necessarily result in a larger family. It just makes it possible, that through infertility issues, a family can get pregnant.<n><n>#### Option D is incorrect<n><n>A baby is a by product of the process.<n><n>#### Option E is incorrect, since it is a medical term and is a process and is not an item.<n><n>### Input<n><n>What is an example of a good question to ask on a first date?

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads.

Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Sally took her medicine and experienced strong side effects.  What did doctors say about the side effects? Choices:  A: great B: distinguished C: remarkable D: excellent E: peculiar<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Choice  D <n>### Explanation:<n>### Explanations:The answer to the question is D (excellent). We can find this through context clues from the questions. The first section states that Sally took a certain medication, which caused severe side effects to her.  The doctors could not determine a cause for these side effects.  We know that if they could not determine a cause, this must mean that we choose excellent since the options are distinguished, marked, peculiar, and excellent. We want to avoid ambiguity, so we want to choose the option that will cause the least ambiguity here. Since this question does not specify exactly what the side effects were, the ambiguity would come from if the side effects were good. "Excellent" would be the best choice since it would eliminate a negative outlook, leaving a positive connotation about the side effects.<n><n>### Input  :  Three numbers are subtracted from a number. The first number subtracted from the number is even. The second number subtracted from the original number is 10. The sum of the original number minus the third number is 87. Find the original number. Choices:  A. 76 B. 81 C. 99 D. 91 E. 44<n><n>### Response  :<n>### Choice   A <n>### Explation:<n>### Reason:The order of the operations must start with the greatest operation first and then the lowest. Since the question states that the first value is even and the second value is 10, we know that an even number must be the number we subtracted from the original. This means that we first must subtract the even number from the original.  We can easily plug in the numbers in the second part of the question, where it states 87 minus the subtraction of the third number, which is 81 minus the first number, which has to be 76. The final answer is 87 minus 76 = 1.  We found that the original number is 97.<n><n>### Example :<n>### Instruction : Two people share the cost of a computer tablet and plan to split the cost evenly.

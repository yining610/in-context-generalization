{"text": "B, the space shuttle\n\n### Discussion:This problem is a little different than the others. First of all, there's no need to count the total of the wicks since once you calculate the total of the two you'll be dividing both by their respective original numbers and the answer will be the same. If you divide 20, the 6-inch wicks by their original number of 20, the answer is still 20, and that makes it the same as the answer in the problem. Also, the wording of the problem is a little tricky, the question is literally, if there are 6 6-inch wick and 12 12-inch (which means the answer is not 18). It says \"equal number of 6- and 12-inches\" which really means 5 12-inch and 15 6-inch. Lastly, once you calculate the number of wick and your final answer (in this case, 16) it's important to keep in mind that just because you've figured out the answer doesn't mean you're correct. Once you see that 16 is an answer you can also notice that it's too low considering the space shuttles in orbit use a lot of water to create water, which has been used in the process. The best strategy for dealing with wording problems like this is to try to ignore the specifics of the question and calculate the answer as it stands. Then you can take the solution, re-write it in your own words and figure out if it will work, as in the example above.\n\n### Inputs:How many ounces of flour are there in 1 cup?\n\n### Response Options:\n- 8 fluid ounces\n- 480 grams\n- 12800 calories\n\n### Response Discussion:10.07\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following multiple choice and multiple-part problems.\n##Answer Key\n##Answer Instructions:", "answer": "A: washing machine"}

In order to keep the safe running regularly, the bank must replenish the safe with the supplies needed in order to operate the safe.\n\nFirst, the bank decides how much money to deposit into the safe over multiple weeks depending on the number of people they plan to have at the bank each week.\n\nThe safe keeps track of how many paper checks the safe has on hand to fulfill deposits. The safe can also track the amount of gas the safe has to complete deposits. Additionally, the safe needs a certain amount of lightbulbs to be able to light a work area. If one of the lightbulbs burns out, the safe will only work if additional lightbulbs are installed. If the lightbulbs are not replaced, the safe is effectively out of service.\n\nYour program will simulate the money and supplies in the safe over time. It should use the following equations.\n\n1. Money in safe every week is based off of the number of openings the safe has.\n\n2. Gas used every week in safe is based off of the amount of deposits that each worker does. There is a separate lightbulb for each worker.\n\n3. The safe only works if there are at least 2 lightbulbs.\n\n4. The bank keeps 2 lightbulbs available in case of an emergency.\n\n5.

{"text": "Answer with choice B\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:Another demonstration of this problem can be seen here. The question is: \"How much does it cost to travel 300 miles?\" In order to solve this question for 300 miles, we first need to know the cost in dollar to travel 1 mile. To do this, we need to create a function that returns the cost in dollars, given the number of miles traveled.\n\n### Here is a function to calculate how much the mileage charge is for a 300-mile car trip.\n\n    function miles_traveled_to_dollars_traveled(total, charge) {\n      return ((total * charge) / 100)\n    }\n\nLet's now return to the question about the cost of traveling 300 miles. Our solution needs to return the cost in dollars for 300 in terms of our provided cost. To show, we would use the \"cost\" function call and let the variable \"cost\" change to 1. We would write:    miles_traveled * cost_to_travel_per_mile\n\nTo show, we would write : miles_traveled = 300 and substitute this value of \" miles_traveled \": 300 into the function.   cost_to_traveled_per_mile = 9\n\n  cost_to_travelling_per_mile = (300 * 9) / 10 = 270  dollars_per_mile = $2.70\n\nThe answer in this example shows as follows:\n\n    > 300 * 2.7 = 810.00 dollars\n\nHowever, what if we want to find the cost in dollars for traveling 600 miles? The same approach as above should apply, but now we would need to change the variables and the function that computes the costs for us, and substitute the value into our original function, to evaluate 600 and get our answer.\n\n---\n\nHere are a few practice problems that you can try.", "answer": "E: surf net"}

Your second code is missing a new line.\n\nSecondly I can help understand one of the statements, and that is \"If she cuts up the whole string into an equal number\". This particular answer choice is correct because if she cuts up the string into equal parts, it'd mean she'd have to cut the whole string up in the same way, and that's not the case.

Is it not logical?\n\nComment: What do you mean by logic? The point of a program is to do exactly what you've programmed. The code is there to show you that you've done the question right, but if you still cannot understand it, please elaborate more on things you don't understand and someone will explain it to you.\n\nComment: I understand the code part but I don't understand why the answer choices are written in this way.

The other multiple choice questions are similarly written which I don't understand either.\n\nComment: If you understand the code, then you have reached the answer. The answer choice is written in the same way as the question. So firstly you are to understand, that if you cut your string into 6 and 12 inch wicks, you are to cut your string an equal way. But that is not the case, so the answer is correct. If your code didn't do the question correctly, then if you were still following the logic you applied to the question, your code would be wrong.

In that case the answer is 0.\n\n### Response\n\nThe answer to input would be 2885 - 0.5625 = 5207.6875\n\n\n\n### Input \nInput: The average weight of a bull is 2000 pounds. Suppose you go to the slaughterhouse and buy three bulls. The animal weights 1050 pounds, the other weighs in at 1350 pounds and the last at 1570 pounds. What is the average weight of the three bulls? (Use average weights only)\nAnswer: 1170\n\n### Response \n\nThe answer for input 4 would be 1325 - 1500 = -175. The answer is negative because when adding you are subtracting from the original.\n\nThis is the same as finding the average of three 500 lb cows. You add 2000 which is the average of the cows together and then you subtract each cows weight by 2000 and you find the average to be 100.\n\n## Exercise 1\n> Exercise 1 - In order to solve this you can either use a calculator and add the two numbers then subtract or you can add the number and subtract them from the original to get the average.\n```\nInput: The 6th grade girls volleyball team has a total of 9 players. 4 of the players weigh 125 pounds and 5 of the players weigh an average of 130 pounds. How much does the 6th grade girls team weigh as a group? Write an equality statement to describe the problem:\n```\n\n### Explanation of how to solve this\nWhen you find the average you must first find the new average which you will write down before you subtract the player's weights from the average.\n\nThe average number of cows can be found by adding the weights of each cow and dividing the total by the number of cows.\n\n```\n$latex avg(100, 1", "answer": "D: vegetable"}

That\u2019s your first \u201csales\u201d letter when reaching out to a potential employer. When looking up how to write a resume and cover letters, you will most likely be overwhelmed with different choices. \n\nCandidate A (acceptance) : Once you've written a successful resume and cover letter, you feel even more comfortable sending it in.  If your resume and cover letter make it past the initial applicant review, then you can expect to be called in for an interview. \n\nC candidate B (rejection) :  Since you\u2019ve already created these pieces of the applications, this is the final step in starting to work towards accepting applications. If you have a strong resume and cover letter but weren't able to make a good impression on your interview, you could still land an invitation to apply. \n\nC Candidate C (Hope):\nThink of your cover letter as your elevator pitch. It\u2019s the first thing they will probably see before they make a judgement. It should highlight why you are a good match for the job and why it would be a good decision for the company. If your resume is the qualifications on what you can do and your cover letter is your elevator pitch to the company; the job interview is when they ask you to prove it. \n\nThere are a couple of important things to look for in your interview. If you already wrote a good resume and cover letter then it should help you to get through the interview and into the next step.  But you should avoid using it as a crutch or even worse using it as a weapon.  Don't talk about how good you are on your resume or use your cover letter as your pitch for why it would be good to accept you as a candidate in their company. Keep it professional no matter what the interviewer asks you about. \n\nIn terms of a job offer, once your application is deemed good enough, then your manager will schedule a time to meet with you. If your interview is successful, then they should give you a formal offer and explain what is needed to accept this offer. \n\nFinally C candidate D (Employment) \nGet", "answer": "B: rejection"}

We should be able to figure out the cheese per pizza and the number of pizza per cheese. We could think of it as dividing the whole cheese by 1/4 for A and whole cheese by 8 for B. We know that our total number of cheese must be 4 because the total number of pieces. This means we have 4 cheese per pizza in A. We know that we have to cut down cheese for the rest, so the minimum number of pizza must be 8 times number of cheese, so the minimum is 36 pieces, and it must be less than 40 because one cheese of 24oz cannot be divided up for that many pieces.\n\nSince we have 8 cheese, we have to figure out the cheeses based on the 24oz cheese by doing the math.

The two locations seem pretty far apart. I\u2019d guess that Alaska is somewhere between 1,000 and 5,000 miles from Russia\u2019s west coast. But Alaska is a state, so it might not even lie in the same time zone.

While Hawaii is only about 7 hours from any U.S. city to the north, a plane ride from the nearest city will take you from 5 hours to 8 hours.

Once fertilization occurs, this will result in us being able to enjoy the fruit and vegetables of a plant.\n\n### Question:\nHow does it take for an egg to fully form?\n>Answer:\n\n### Instructions:\nExplain the purpose of the code.\nThe solution should create a function called 120(35). The first parameter is the result and the second parameter is the total amount of days in the year.\n\nThen: 0.5 * 120 or 60\nThe first 2 days is the first weekend (Friday/Saturday) + The day before (1 day).\nThe second weekend is every other day (Sunday/Monday/Tuesday)\n\n>\n\n### Demote:\nThe function first takes the result of the days from 120.\n0.5 of 120, or 60, is placed into the variable.\n\nOnce this is complete, each additional parameter is applied. These parameters are in a 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 format. So the 1st parameter would be 0 and the 2nd would be 1, etc. This means that the first weekend would contain 60, because it already includes 0.5 of the day, and then 120-60 which has 60 from the weekend. Then the 2nd parameter would be a full day in between the weekends because 3 would be the full value of 60 or 2 and the remainder (120-3-60) = 120-3 =117 = 1.\n\nSo the next parameter would be 120-1, a full weekday, and then you would take a look at the next parameter and realize that you only need to add the number of days in that workday onto the", "answer": "B: buzz"}

{"text": "E\n\n### Instructions:Find the odd one out. The answers are listed below the question.\n\n## \n\nIf given a list of things, how are you supposed to find the odd one out? I was very frustrated and confused until I decided to start thinking differently. To tackle this question, you must re-frame your solution to something abstract: the concept of similarity. Each question is asking you to pick an answer that\u2019s not like the other (something with a different identity). This is a great question if you have an aptitude for math: think about the concept of infinity. Everything that you can perceive is a number between 0 and infinity. Anything outside of that range is an \u201cinfinite,\u201d which you can\u2019t associate with. With that in mind, the concept of identities starts to get clearer. Let\u2019s see how that works. In this first example, you\u2019re supposed to find a piece of fruit that isn\u2019t an orange:\n\nInput: Which of the following fruits is not an orange? A: Pineapple B: Apple C: Tangerine\n\nResponse:\n\nC -- Tangerines are a type of orange\n\nLet\u2019s take another look at that example. Each of the answers is labeled with a letter with the answer being the one that doesn\u2019t correspond to the other answers. So if all these items are somehow related, why is one unrelated to the rest? Take a look at each option and try to think of it as its own individual identity \u2013 one that stands out on its own. You can\u2019t say that Pineapples aren\u2019t oranges because that\u2019d be a contradiction to the word \u201cnot.\u201d What about the Apple? How is an Apple not an orange? Think of the word \u201capple\u201d as a category of items. So now the question becomes: Which of the following is not an apple? Answer: C - Tangerine\n\nInfinity\n\nNot a real thing, but a concept of identity.\n\nEvery other item on the list is of a similar kind.\n\nAsk yourself: What makes one thing different?\n\n\n\n\n## \n###Input:In a high school, there are a total of 3300 students, and 118 of them are foreign exchange students.

E: The water area is smaller than the land area.\n\n### Response:(b) Water spouts are common in warm shallow water because warm water rises. When warm water comes together, it forms a circular area above the surface known as a column of warm air. When air in the column of warm air rises high into the atmosphere and cools faster than cool air beneath the water the column will rise even higher leading to the water appearing to spout outwards.

How far is the entrance to the patio from the house\u2019s entrance?\n\n### Answer\n\nThe distance from the fence to the patio can be calculated by subtracting the horizontal distance from the fence, to the right side, and the vertical distance up the steps. This gives us a horizontal distance of six feet plus an added 25 feet from the top of steps to the left side of the patio (which we subtract from 45 when added to the horizontal distance) = 34 feet. 2 horizontal plus 1 vertical = 29 feet.

In each shift, each employee must work the first 3 shifts and then take a 6 shift break before working another 3 shifts.  The first shift starts at 5:00 a.m., the second shift at noon, the third shift at 5:05 p.m., the fourth shift at 1:20 p.m., the fifth shift at 10:50 p.m., and the sixth shift at 5:50 a.m.  Each employee works both breaks.  In each shift there must be an employee assigned to work that shift, and there must be at least one employee assigned to each shift.  No employee can work more than 3 shifts consecutively.  The first shift must have a minimum of 2 employees assigned to the shift, at least one of whom must be the most flexible employee.  How many employees must be assigned to each shift?\n\n### Response\nThe total number of employees is 6. There are two people who can work the 5:00 shift; hence, two (2). There are two people who would have to take a break; hence, two ( 2). The only requirement for the 10:55 time slot is to have a least one (1 ) person in the slot, which is easy to find as there are two people for each of the preceding shifts.  The 5:05 slot requires one (1) flexible employee. There are two people that have the flexibility needed. It is theorized that only one employee could have this flexibility because the slots were numbered from one to six and, hence, all of the people that did not fit into the first slots could not have any flexibility as that would leave out the five and six employees.

{"text": "A\n\n### Demostration:\n```\n  The expression is a single-term arithmetic sequence which can be expressed as 5n +3, where 5 + 3/2 = 7 + 1.5 = 8.5 but it\u2019s a lot of work to get down there. We can solve this as 8.5n - 3 = 4.  If 4 is a positive integer, then n = 4/8.5 and 8.5n + 3 =\n     12.5 + 3 = 15/8.5 = 1.76... but it\u2019s far to cumbersome to keep multiplying by.76 and it\u2019s too big so we stop the number to 15. If you wanted to check these values, you could go up a step. If we subtract 15 from both sides, the equation will become 8.5n = 2 and now you have a new equation which you could use again. 8.5 is a fraction so when you do 5/8.5 + 3 you would have to multiply both sides by 5/8.85. Doing this should yield you an answer of n = 5/8. I think you don\u2019t have to actually solve this like I did, this is a math test so if you actually solved it than you are already pretty smart! You could just do it as I did with the equation 8.5n=15 and work it backward to figure out what n is equal to by just subtraction.\n  ```", "answer": "D: pain"}

{"text": "C\n\n### Input\n> I need a 4 page paper comparing and evaluating the two articles below. One being the United States government and what they have done to combat the epidemic of human trafficking/ sex trade with the use of FED dollars and legislation. The second being the United Arab Emirates federal laws against any sort of trafficking, including sexual, and their attempts on a smaller scale to combat it.\n\n### Response\nA paper comparing and evaluating two articles like this may be a little over the top. I think that a paper that breaks down what I will go through in my response would be more effective. That would entail the main points raised in each article about what the United States Federal Goverment has proposed to combat the sexual/human trafficking crisis, and what the United Arab Emirate has done or proposed in regards to legislation. Then I think it would be helpful to break down what the author(s) of each article is saying. How do they see problems in what the other country is/ has done to try and address the issue. Do they find what was proposed by the government in the United States to be a fair and logical approach? How do they feel the UAE is performing in preventing sex/human traffickng (keep in mind not all sex trafficking involves humans but I will use the term interchangably). They should not be taking a stance for which country they believe is doing a better job. The intent of such a paper would be to compare the various approaches taken in combating the issue and what could help the other country.\n\n\n### Input : I need a 8 to 10 page case study\n\n### Response : I will do the research into the information of the case study, in respect to your requirements.\n\n### Input  : I need a paper or summary that can be no more than ONE page.

{"text": "Answer: B. The millpond is a lake made by building a dam. Hence, the beaver can make a dam to form a millpond that destroys the machine by impeding the running of it. It is therefore, wrong to say that the beaver destroyed the machine by building the dam in the strip club. Beaver was not thinking of the strip club. It was about the water. Hence, the beafer should be blamed for building the dam in the lakes, rivers or millponds. A pocket cannot be used to make an engine as the beaver built because you don't make things that are not there.\n\n### Challenge:If you make the cost to be negative, will your logic change?\n\nIf the cost is negative, there would be no problem.

One morning, while brushing their teeth, they each wanted to be the last one into the bathroom after they finished, regardless of age. Jack, the oldest, didn't like this because he had been brushing his teeth for a long time. So, when Kate, the youngest, told him she preferred being last to being first, Jack gave her a shrug and moved on. When Alex, who is in the middle, then told Jack the same thing Jack responded by shaking his head and saying, \"\"Then I don't want to be last either.\"\" He also left the bathroom.  What age are Daniel and Kate if this happened?\nAnswer: Daniel must be between 6 and 8. Kate must be between 2 and 3. Since Jack was the oldest, he left first, and when he did, Daniel left. Then, Alex left. The other two left simultaneously. Kate was the youngest, so she left after Alex. If Jack was the oldest child, he would have left first", "answer": "A: reality"}

{"text": "### 4\nA waiter sets the table.\n\n### Input\nIn a country, the age distribution of males is 1:1.2:1.5:3:9:16.6. If the total population is 1000000, how many males are there?\n\n### Response\nThe 5 numbers make the sequence 1, 2, 1.5, 3, 9, 16.6,. If each number is the ratio between two numbers, then the first is 1 and the last is 16.6.  The mean (arithmetic mean) between the other numbers is (1 + 2 + 1.5 + 3 + 9)/5 = 7. So, the first two numbers have to be 1 and 7, and the third number is half way between two. So, 3 is the middle number between 1 and 7. We'll call it 4. So now 1, 4, 3, 1.5 and 9 have to be 5 numbers in a sequence.  Let's put one in 1st place, 4 in the middle place, 3 in the second middle place, 1.5 in third middle place, and 9 at the end. Each is its own ratio. Rearrange so that they divide equally into 1000,000: 4/(10000)=1,076, or 1.076. Now the first ratio is 1 and it's got to divide into the same number. We know that 1 will multiply by the same number as before, that is 100, and that will give us 1000. So, 1 is.01 or.1%. Therefore,.1% of 1000 = 1. That means the number of females is.01, or approximately 10,100.\n\n### Credits:\nThis solution is provided by [Viveka Prabakaran](https://github.com/Vivekaprabakaran), an author and contributor to the HackerNoon Book Club community.", "answer": "E: present bill"}

{"text": "(E)\n### Comments:\nYou are right on the question. But the output needs to be more specific. How much candy could Pablo have bought if he was given $15?\nThis question has a typo. It states that the friends planned to buy the car. The question should have been posed with \"The six friends planned to pool the funds and buy a car.\" But this means that the friends should have been dividing the cost with the leftover being given to Brad. So the cost that he needs to pay is 40 times the original cost which is $68.\n\nThe amount that each friend puts in is 500/6 or $83.30. This is because we already have the amount that the car wash made ($500) from where Harper needed to buy teacher appreciation gift items for her children's teachers.\nThis needs more specifics. How much does each gift cost? You need to look at how many 3 eggs in the fridge were being used for making cakes and the cost of the eggs.\nThis one should be a little more specific. She made 325 (240 and 100 + 132) from what she's taking after the 0. The answer you got is wrong because it only takes you a fraction of what was sold and sold twice that amount to which you did not account for the remaining fraction that she sold from her original plan.\nThe number that was left was 13.\n\nI like that this question is more general. We can use a little manipulation to make sure the crayons are the same color and then sum up. Since there are six boxes we can use a binary division system where each time we divide 3 in the first 6 boxes will we get 1 and 0 indicating a red and a blue. If we did six times it would have looked like: 111111\nNext, we should divide the number into 20. 8 goes into 20 once and 4 goes into 20 twice. We can use 8 times the number we got for a blue crayon and 8 once again to get the number of red crayons.

Four years ago Amy was twice as old as Melissa and their grandmother was twenty times as old as Melissa.  How old is Amy\u2019s sister?\nAnswer: 6\n\n### Deminstration:\nInput : Amy\u2019s birthday is 10 years from now. If she is twice as old than Melissa now, which is 4 years ago, we can write this:\n\\[2x - 4 = 2x - 8\\]\nSince x is being subtracted twice, and it cannot be negative, x is 4\\[-8\\] = -4\n\\[x -4 = x - 8\\]\n\\[x = 12 \\]\nSince Amy was twice as old than Melissia, she is 6 today, since 6 is half of 12. Hence, Amy is 6 and Melissa is 4 now.\n\nGrandmother age:\n\\[80 - (4x) = 80 - 12x = 80 - (12x - 4) = 80 + 8  80 + (4 - 8) = 80\\]\n\nWe subtracted 12x from both sides, and as a result, 8 is being added to both sides.\\[80 - 8 = 80\\] \\[80 + 8 = 88\\]\n\nTherefore, after 4 years, 8 more grandmother years, will make it total of 88 years old.\n\nAmy's answer:\nAmy is 2/3rd of Melissia's age so her age is going to be Melissa's age minus 2 to get Amy's age.\n\n4 years ago: Amy is twice Melissa's age, but 4 years ago, Amy is only 2/3rd Melissa's age. Therefore, 4 years ago, 2x - 4 can be written as:\n\n\\[2\\frac{2}{3} -4 = \\frac{2}{3}\\times 4\\]\nSubtracting the numerator of two", "answer": "E: engage"}

You got the final answer correct you just need to check.\n\n### Input/Example:\n\n#### Instructions: The chef has 37 eggs. He puts 6 eggs in the fridge. The remaining 31 eggs are cooked into 39 pancakes. If each pancake has 3 eggs, how many cakes are in the pan?\n\n#### Expert\n37 eggs = 6 eggs in fridge + 31 eggs cooked into pancakes with 3 eggs per pancake = 9 pancakes + 31 eggs\n\nSo how many eggs do they have left? 37 - 9 pancakes - 31 left = 3 eggs.\n\n#### Student\nHow many pancakes are in the pan is wrong, each serving is 4 pancakes. So 31 eggs / 4 pancakes per serving = 7 and 3 eggs = 7 - 3 = 4 pancakes, or 4 servings.\n\n### Answer\n\n37 eggs - 9 pancke=3 eggs, where 3 eggs is left over to make more pancakes. The answer is 4 pancakess, because each serving contains 4 pancakes which totals 15 if each serving were one pancake, but that would be dumb. Because there are 46 eggs in total to distribute, each pancake can hold three eggs, but when distributed by whole servings it is 4 pancackers per serving. So the", "answer": "A: pet store"}

{"text": "Choice \"C\"\n\n### Demostration:\nBoth of these answers are true for me. I'm not sure what others think\nBoth of these statements are true for me\n\nAnswer:\n\n```\n- \"I will never kill them all at once if I do not believe in them.\"\n- \"I may kill a fly or a mosquito now and then.\"\n```\n\n### Input 2: You are a hunter from the North with a strong hunting sense. You are offered to fight a black bull on an arena. The odds are 100:1 of you winning. If the black bull is not wearing armor and has 100hp, what must the odds be that you will kill it in one hit if you do have a strong hunting sense?\n\n### Demosc:\nIf the black bull has 100 HP, a hit that kills the bull would take 3.333...% off its HP.\nHence if you have a strong hunting sense, it is equivalent to having 23.334% of chances of killing the bull after one hit.\n\n### Response 2:\n\n```\nTo a black bull\nWith no armor or helmet \nThat still has 100 hp\nI must achieve at least 99 hits to hit it once\n- There are only two cases. First I can't hit it at all\nAnd second I'll kill it immediately, so there is 98 of the cases which are impossible.\n```\n\n## Explanation:\n\nFor task 1, all of those questions were easy for me. So I didn't feel like doing them as part of the \"practice\" for task 2. For the second task, I just used some logical reasoning. I had to use what I know, and try to fit all the given information into this one equation. After trying different approaches (that doesn't involve solving 98 cases where I'll fail to hit the bull at all), I just tried to use some common rules. The rules stated that\n- if I kill the bull instantly, then it's impossible for me to kill the bull at one attack if it didn't have armor\n- even if it takes all", "answer": "E: kill yourself"}

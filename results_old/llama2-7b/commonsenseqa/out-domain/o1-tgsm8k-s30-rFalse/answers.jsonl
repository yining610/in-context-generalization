In this case we will have to calculate the difference between 8 and 11, which gives 3. Then, we will know that we will have 3 working days. Then, the question is about the cost of the renting on the first working days. This is 30.

Movie theaters are usually located in stand-along buildings. But if you choose B, urban area then your answer is correct because in an urban area there is often a large retail facility called a shopping mall that combines a movie theater with other stores. Or if you choose shopping mall then that\u2019s also correct because usually shopping malls do combine retail stores and at large malls there is a movie theater. The military base can only be in a military base or military town, not a shopping mall or urban area or large city area because the military rarely has a cinema or movie hall in the middle of the military installation. There's an explanation:\n\n### Explanation:\n\n### Extension: If you choose C, New York city or D, military base then your answer is wrong. The first choices are both incorrect because New York City does not fit the definition because shopping is usually not free in large cities, except in large malls and urban areas.

For example, if the sequence is\n\nD 10,0,0,0\n\nthen the car that drives 10,0-20,00/year could park every day, but the resident who drives 20,0-25,00/year must rely on the spot on even number of days. Therefore, there could be as many as three cars parked at once. If you allow this to happen every day, then the number of residents who could park is one car every day.\n\n### Output\nInput: The input consists of 10 positive integers, followed by the integer 0.\nOutput: The program must output the number of cars that are assured parking at least once per day.\nNote: You should assume that the city will not permit more than one car to park in a space on any given day.\nExplanation: You can check that the only car that could park daily is that for the resident who uses fewer cars per year.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/alokd/DiceProject/blob/master/instructions/Instruction.pdf?raw=true\" style=\"height:300px; width:600px; max-height", "answer": "A: cause death"}

These radio waves, which cannot be received by human ears, follow the properties of electric field and magnetism, thus are also known as electromagnetic waves. Radio waves can be produced by antenna which convert electrical energy to radio energy and vice versa. These antennas are placed either on top of the television set or on roof/ground depending upon the property.\nRadio has wide number of applications in modern world. It allows us to access more than a dozen AM and FM radio stations. We use radio for entertainment, for news and weather forecast. Radio is used by different police departments, rescue services, and various airports to send and receive critical messages and calls.

A person at a later point in line is removed and put in the buffer for each person who is removed.  The queue system has been designed to hold the buffer wide open between all the farms that have queue systems.

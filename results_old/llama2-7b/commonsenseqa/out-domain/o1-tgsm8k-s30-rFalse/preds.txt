Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Answer: 310<n><n>### Input:Ben was an alcoholic and was in an accident.  Because of his mistake, he spent 8 years somewhere. Where was he? Choices:  A: prison B: bridge C: locked up D: homeless shelter E: neighbor's house<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Jennie rented a car from the car-rental agancy for a week. After 11 days she returned the car to the car-rental and she was charged 190 dollars. So, I will use the principle of counting the given numbers to solve the question. Since is asked for the first week of renting the car, first we will have to determine the number of working days inside the week. In this case we will have to calculate the difference between 8 and 11, which gives 3. Then, we will know that we will have 3 working days. Then, the question is about the cost of the renting on the first working days. This is 30. However, since we will calculate after 11 days, and the working days were 3, we have to double the cost of the car to have a better result. So, the total cost of this rental will be 60.<n><n>

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Answer: 310<n><n>### Input:Where can you find a movie theater along with other stores in one placE? Choices:  A: downtown area B: urban area C: new york city D: shopping mall E: military base<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Discussion: If you choose A, downtown area or shopping mall then your answer is wrong because a large-city area or suburb does not have a movie theater in one place. Movie theaters are usually located in stand-along buildings. But if you choose B, urban area then your answer is correct because in an urban area there is often a large retail facility called a shopping mall that combines a movie theater with other stores. Or if you choose shopping mall then that’s also correct because usually shopping malls do combine retail stores and at large malls there is a movie theater. The military base can only be in a military base or military town, not a shopping mall or urban area or large city area because the military rarely has a cinema or movie hall in the middle of the military installation. There's an explanation:<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>### Extension: If you choose C, New York city or D, military base then your answer is wrong. The first choices are both incorrect because New York City does not fit the definition because shopping is usually not free in large cities, except in large malls and urban areas. The second choice, military base is incorrect because it is rare for a military base to have a movie theater, especially ones that are in the middle of large military installations.<n><n>### Note: What’s the difference between A and E?<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>### Feedback<n><n>### Your Answer<n><n>### Request:Input:On a road trip you’re riding in a friend’s car and the friend’s cell phone rings.

She found a sale on apples for $1.50/pound. Her rental agreement stated that she could use the kitchen to store things during the 6 day period. One night, she was watching TV when she realized that her apples were almost brown. She bought peaches at a nearby market for $4.50/pounds. The cottage was 150 miles from her home. There was a bus going to the cottage one day a week. Jennie could put the apples in the fridge in the kitchen at the cottage, but the bus came on Thursdays. Therefore, she could not put all of her apples in the frig. The bus did not take passengers on the other days of the week, so she could not get back in time to pick up the other apples.<n>The apples were the only thing she had to eat in the middle of the week.  However, her cottage did not have ice.<n>If she placed the fresh peaches in the cooler part of the kitchen that had ice, how many apples could she store until the next week?<n><n>### Answer<n>The apples should last 3 1/2 days.<n><n>### Question 3 of 5<n><n>Blake owns a construction company.

The computer tells the programmer which variable will be used for what, and what the range of that variable will be. If the variable is not declared in the correct locations, the computer will give an error for the statement.<n><n>### Definition:<n>A variable is defined when it is given a value. Once a variable is defined, it cannot be used again, until it is defined again. If the variable is re-defined, the second time is defined with the variable, it will overwrite the old value definition.<n><n>### Ex:<n>The `a` variable is declared in the first line of script.

Use Regex to extract what are inside in the text.<n>2. Use the.split() method to split text into string.<n>3. Use.join() method to combine the text extracted by regex and reassemble.<n>Use the format of the regex for the pattern and put the first pattern and then use of the OR operators. In this case OR, we could use OR, ( | | | \s | ). You can add more things or less if it is not too much data. Do not add many if it is a lot of data. In our case, I think we can do it with one pattern.<n>**<n>### Example<n>We are going to extract the name of the food.<n>We use (?P<name>\w+).join(" ")\s+(?P<desc>.) to extract.<n>"Hummus is a chickpea dip"<n>"Macaroni and cheese"<n>"Salmon"<n>"Hummus"(name)<n>"Macaroni"(name)<n><n>The result of the above command is Hummus<n>Macaroni and cheeses<n>Salmon<n>Hummus<n>Macaroaon and cheese<n><n>---<n>### Example <n>*In this example, to extract multiple answers, we can use the for loop.<n>We use split to put every space between spaces for this function, but instead of spaces, we will use the word ',' as separated by spaces.<n>When splitting the strings, you can replace it with a more complex regex, but this code can be done easily by using of the split function in python.<n><n>*The output will be in the same array as above.<n><n>

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Answer: 310<n><n>### Input:James complained that Alexa's electric guitar was too loud and he couldn't get any work done at home,  so she decided that she should get an acoustic guitar.  Where might she look for one? Choices:  A: house B: music shop C: studio D: storage E: closet<n><n>### Response:		<n>Choice C: Music shop<n><n>### Explanation<n>Given data and instructions, I choose choice C.<n><n>Given the music shop, I find the cost of the electric guitar.<n><n>The rent is $30, as my initial guess.<n><n>Cost of the electric guitar: $30 per day x 11 days + $190 per 11 days <n><n>$30 * 11 + 190 = $390 + 190 <n><n>=$580<n><n>I do not choose A, C, D or E because they are not reasonable answers. A is not realistic because she cannot find an electric guitar within the house. B does not include the cost of the electric guitars and does not include it with the store. D is not accurate because she is looking for an acoustic guitar and store has different type. E is also incorrect because the guitar case comes with it.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Answer: 310<n><n>### Input:Bob and Boris were standing in a queue at the grocery store.  They were standing in place.  The line was fast, but the children in front of them were loud.   They were what? Choices:  A: frustration B: being annoyed C: delays D: irritation E: out of order<n><n>### Response:		Delays <n><n>### Example:The queue system has been programmed to always maintain a 200-yard buffer between the last person in the queue and the farmer’s crop.  The queue manager receives an alarm when the buffer closes in the other direction.  The manager then goes to the buffer point and moves one of the people in line back about 200 feet.  A person at a later point in line is removed and put in the buffer for each person who is removed.  The queue system has been designed to hold the buffer wide open between all the farms that have queue systems.  If any one of the queues fills up, the buffer will open back up because it is not tied to any farm in particular.  Which of the following actions would be most likely to cause the buffer to be closed on the farm? Choices:  (A) a single person is removed from the queue B) the queue manager removes all the children from the queue C) a lot of people arrive at the farm D) a lot of people depart from the farm E) a large crowd assembles outside the farm<n><n>###Response: None of these<n><n>### Example<n>The queue system has been designed so that people departing from the farm will not close the buffer unless it is closed by people entering the farm, unless they are being removed from the queue or transferred to a holding area.  People leaving a retail store, restaurant, or similar place that uses this type of queue system may see a “queue closed” sign at the exit and may leave, rather than being transferred to the buffer zone.  If the queue manager removes all of the people from the farmer’s queue for which they are supposed to be held, and places them into the buffer, what is likely to happen?<n>```<n><n>```<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input:A company sells many types of goods and services.

What might they be watching? Choices:  A: movies B: theatre C: cabaret D: conference E: meeting<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Ans: [**C**](https://leetcode.com/problems/multiple-choice-question/#/description/9040/a4be719635bab7da4d6130086455395da8321f9d)<n><n>- The projector displayed people on a huge screen while the audience (that’s us) laughed. In my opinion the screen should be an interactive whiteboard, like Miro/Mural.com in which the audience can interact with each other while the speaker is presenting.<n>- Another more interesting use case would be to have the audience to watch a presentation in the same room, at the same time, on different screens. In this case the projection screen is the center of the attention while the speakers have their own screens where they can see and respond to the real time feedback (through the chat) from the audience.<n>- I am also thinking about gamifying the learning activity. <n><n>### Instructions:Complete the puzzle provided by substituting the given elements, as indicated in parenthesis, for the question marks below:<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>Input:<n><n>```text<n>  12 47 6 72 56 45 (83 26) 29 55 9 46<n>```<n><n>Output:<n><n>```text <n>2905085776 33 37 65297 66 9<n>```<n><n>### Inputs:<n><n>12: 1+2=3(+)1=31<n><n>47: 4+7=12(+)7=19(+)1=191<n><n>6: 6-3=3(+1=4)<n><n>45: 4+5=9(+)9=18(+)1=181<n><n>456: 4+5+6=779<n><n>29:    2+9=11<n><n>55:    5+5=10<n><n>```javascript<n>  function multipleChoiceQuestions(questionList) {<n>  let answer = Array(questionList.length).fill('-!-');<n>  for (let

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Answer: 310<n><n>### Input:What is illegal to do when you play cards at a casino? Choices:  A: remember B: help C: count D: winning E: dealing<n><n>### Response:		C: The only thing illegal to do is count or be an “undesirable gambler”. This is because this could be taken as card counting and being able to use the information of what cards have come out and been dealt to win big as well as being counted as an “undesirable gamer”, which could be someone who could be a “card counter” or is seen as a threat to the house or casino employees and other players because of the actions they’ve taken or the person they’re looking out for, which could be you.<n><n>### Input-Incorrect:<n>*A: Remembering information about what cards have come out in the past when playing a card game could take away from the game itself and could make it less fun and enjoyable, as well as being taken away as a “win”.<n>*B: A: Remembering information about or helping others keep track of what cards have come and been dealt in the past can be used at your advantage and may even be considered “winning a game” you should remember that it is a “gamble” and there should be other people doing the work for you and it’s not illegal to remember what’s already been done in a game or even be helped by other people with what they know to better help you do even better. In the game of poker for example, this could be called card counting and could be considered illegal and is not allowed at the casino.<n>*C: In most card games I have ever heard of or been in, counting things like the cards that have have come out and been played, or helping other players when to play a certain card you know to help them win is not something you should do.<n>*D: No, winning is not considered illegal in this question or in most card games. I am not aware of any casino or card where this is considered as something that would be punishible or even illegal to do.<n>*E: Dealing cards is something that could potentially be legal or illegal depending on how you’re dealing or are aware of what other players are doing, and how you may be helping them because of what they tell you, do not do this if this is the case because you can be punished or even sent home from a casino for this, in most card games this is not seen as something illegal, the only thing that could be looked at if it is illegal is if it’s part of a che

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Answer: 310<n><n>### Input:Some might say that if you want to do something that results in changing society then you need to start from within, to do this what would you be doing? Choices:  A: riots B: vote C: change yourself D: social activism E: change clothes<n><n>### Response:		A: riots<n><n>### Feedback:<n> <n>"The correct answer is A, or ‘riots’. The text suggests that ‘doing something’ that ‘results in changing society’ can be done by means of ‘activism’ (in response to a question about ‘social activism’). But it is not suggested that changing society means starting from within, or that ‘doing something that results in changing’ one's own clothes might change society – so those alternatives are incorrect. On the other hand, a reference to ‘doing something’ has no clear relationship to ‘change social cloths’, so that can't be correct either."<n><n>## Author:Kumar.<n><n>## Solution:<n> A: riots<n><n><n>## Comments:<n> This task has the following problems. <ol> <li>This task does not have correct answers, because the answer choice A is too general.

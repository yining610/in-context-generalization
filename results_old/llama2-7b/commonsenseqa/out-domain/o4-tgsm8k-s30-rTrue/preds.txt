Choices:  A: neighborhood B: subdivision C: city D: suburbs E: street<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### E<n><n>|Rationales:|   |<n>|----|----|<n>|A is correct. He would start by looking in the different neighborhoods within the city or town. In a neighborhood, houses are often very close to each other and the gates may not provide much privacy. Neighborhoods often have a well-defined shape and entrance, which you usually find near a main street, which also means you will see many more other people in and out of the home. On the other hand, if he picks the subdivision, he would have privacy, but often less room and little to expand the house. Suburbs often have their own gate, just like the city would, though there might be less gates in each suburb. Subdivisions and suburbs are usually more spread out, so you will not see as many people.|<n>|<n><n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question. The answer is shown.<n><n>###

Rocks are typically found in many places where the sunlight is not able to easily reach them.  This also excludes them from fungal growth.<n>Melissa does not travel to Manhattan often or at all, so this is not an acceptable answer.<n>Toenails grow on your feet. This is a safe place for fungal growth (this fact is provided in the input.)<n>The grocery store is not a safe place as it is a constant high traffic area.  It is possible, but rare for this to occur.<n>Lastly, in the input it states that "the fallen tree..." where fallen trees are subject to fungal growth, meaning this is the correct answer, but it is not provided in the input. <n>#### C<n>Answer: C<n><n>### Input:"The car-rental aggreement says that all charges are subject to Florida sales tax.

So, a total of 580 is charged to the renter.<n><n>In this case the cost of the renter is charged 9.5%, so the sales tax we need to account for is = 9.5% of 580 = $54.90<n><n>#### Total Payment = $580+$54.90 = $634.90<n>Answer: $634

Stars seemed to be falling upon us!  It was terrifying.  Everyone was screaming and scrambling for the nearest building to hide under.  At first, I thought I was mistaken.  But then, I felt it...the tickling on my skin.  It was raining stars!  It was just like in the movies, but I couldn't think of a good plot twist to go with it.  So I ran for a building.  It seemed to take forever to get to the building.  I looked up as I ran and saw that there were stars everywhere.  But, as I ran, my leg caught on a root, or something, and I ended up falling. Then the rain got even heavier.  It must have been the beginning of a hurricane, but it was as cold as ice.  That is until the rain began to fall.  I finally got into the building, a cemetery I'd noticed along the way.  I crawled towards an open grave and got in.  I didn't feel any warmer, though.  I was freezing.  The rain stopped but the whole sky was black now.  The only thing you could see was lightning.  It was the scariest thing ever.  Suddenly, I heard footsteps.  Then I saw a shadow.  It was the Gruncher, the scariest monster that ever lived.  He was even scarier because he was in a mask!  And behind him were all his monster friends!  Their bodies were all messed up and one even had a bunch of sticks and leaves stuck to him.  I've never felt so scared in my life. The Grunchers were coming at me with their strange weapons and I didn't know what to do.  I knew I had to get out of the grave I was in or I would be eaten.  And that would be even scarier than the Grunchers!  So then, I ran into the shadows behind the tombstones.  It was so dark I couldn't see my hand in front of my face.  It felt like forever, but in the end

In the 35 minutes that it takes to complete this trip, it is safe to assume that each minute he has spent driving in those 35 minutes has taken him the same distance from his bus station to Diana's house, or from her house to his bus station.

Choices:  A: board ship B: shout at C: smile at D: cross street E: feel happy<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is either cross street or feel happy. The answer is determined using _________. If you choose cross street, what you know from before about the context is that you can cross to get somewhere. You are able to cross between the two buildings which tells you that you can cross the street (in this context, the street means the walking way between the two buildings). And you are able to feel happy, as you have seen so many people say that they feel happy about crossing the street to get to a location. You can get the attention of a stranger across the room by smiling at them. This tells you that this choice, A or C, are both good answers, even if A is better than C. However, to get the attention of a group of people in a room it seems like you might have to shout as they are sitting and in a room. This tells you that B is excluded. You can also cross the room (cross street) since the room is in fact a room in a building and it allows you to get to a location by crossing the street. This tells you that you can get the attention of the room by shouting at them or crossing the room. All of these answer choices are good (and good enough) answers for this problem. The answer is C, the crossstreet.<n><n>**_How to answer the question: _**If I wanted to cross the road and get the attention of a store owner. I could cross the road by crossing _____.<n><n>\<n>![](https://github.com/pamelaz/pamelaz.github.io/raw/master/assets/img2.png)<n><n>Choices: A board ship at C<n><n>Answer: C (crossing the road)<n><n><n>**_How you know the answer: _**If I want to get someones attention it is common to smile, and look at someone. You can call out and ask for them. I can also walk over to them. In this context, if I went to another building and crossed streets and then returned to my building, the store owner would notice me.<n>

The animals got separated after they stopped for a while to dry out by the sea. Each group of animals a bird, a squirrel and a rat went its separate way as each group decided for itself where to go.  The bird flew away.  The bird said to them,  "We have found one tree on the island, so we'll go where it is located."  The squirrel then said, "The food is right where we are, so we'll stay here."  The rat said, "The best choice is in the middle of the island where we are."  As a result, the squirrel and the rat decided on their own to stay where they were.  The bird left and didn't tell the squirrel and rat where the one tree they had found was located.  The animals are at a standstill. Which animal had the best judgment?  Choices: A: squirrel B: rat C: bird D: rat and squirrel<n><n>Rationales:  The answer given by the rat and squirrel is the best. The bird left without telling the other animals where to find the one tree that was left by the group.  This is what lead to the group being divided.  If the bird had been willing to share the secret of the tree with the squirrel and rats, they would have been able to find the one tree they had agreed to go look for and would have been saved the time of spending the entire day looking for it.<n><n>#### B: Skip<n>Answer: B: Skip<n><n>### Input : (Based on a story about the bermuda triangle) Three friends got stuck in traffic at night, after being at a gas station for some time, the car ran out of gas.

Their initial thoughts that there may be a central passage through a site that may connect some of the rooms were incorrect. A burial tomb does not involve a door or some sort of passage on any kind of structure. An ‘arena’ is a venue that could feature a circular building where performances may take place and so it is more than likely outside and made of stone or some other structure built using materials found on site. Large buildings would include structures that are the size of the site or even buildings that may take up more than one room and are built on site.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Rationales: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n><n>### Input:The banjo finds it's history in the Caribbean, but it's probably most famous where?

Since he rents his house as well, he had to pay both ways. The cost for a day is 700$ and you'll have $14 days.<n>Jason doesn't charge for his own equipment so that is 700/14=<<700/10=700>>700<n>So the cost will be $1400.00.<n>#### E:<n>You'll have 26 days driving to the grocery store back and forward.<n><n>#### T:<n>When Melissa goes to town each day she needs to use gas to go there and back.  She will most likely not just stop at the store, but she will get gas in town as well, so she might have to stop at two different places.<n>So she will need to take 7 hours for a 2 hour drive, a 4hour drive to get gas and 1 hour to get back.<n>Since there is 12 months in

A: she can get a set for $84 and have 4 extra for $3 which means she’ll spend a total of 4*$48=<<4*$48=192>>192 or B: she can get a 5th set for $95 which would cost a total of 125+45=<<125+49=174>>174. If she decides to get the set of 4 tires plus 5th spare tire, what are the differences between the two car’s purchasing cost?<n><n>### Dem:<n>In the question, there is a scenario that describes what Mabel will need to pay, so we know she will pay at least $3 for 4 extra tires. There is a choice about what set of tires she wants. For choice A, it says if she wanted a set of tires that costed $84, she will get a tire for $48 and she has 4 tires. Therefore, option A’s total will be 4*$48=$84$. Since option B says if she want a set of 5, she will have to pay $125+$40=$165. Therefore, option B’s total cost will be $165. So, the option with the lower cost will be A. Option A will cost $84 or less, and option B will cost $165 or more, so A is the right answer.<n><n>### Additional Scenario:The rental agency charges $20/hour for a car.

The complex sentence is structured to connect the two sentences using a comma, which would not be appropriate if the clause under consideration were the only main clause in the sentence.  Since the main clause contains a related independent clause, the main clause and the subordinate clause form a complex sentence.  Note that there is a semicolon after the subordinate (or dependent) clause of 4.  This is a good idea; it keeps you using the semicolons correctly.  If the question pertained to the subordinating conjunction under consideration, you would have used and or but.  If the subject of the sentence were an adjective, the question under consideration would be asking you to find the adjective for the clause.

There are many places where human might sit extended periods over a bowls of water. The options given are as follow; A: B: C:<n>A: The bathroom would not be a suitable place to sit extended periods over a water bowl. Many people are ill all over the world and it is not unusual to see someone on the toilet or sink.<n>B: The solar system would not be a suitable answer to this question. Our solar system is made up of the Sun and 8 planets (and their moons). Water is much more abundant in our galaxy of the Milky Way and even outside of our galaxy. There are other answers that seem more suitable such as the ocean (the water on our planet) or other planets in our solar system.<n>C: Another option that does not seem to fit the answer to this question is a coffee shop. The coffee shop would be a suitable place to get water from a drink (coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc.) but not a place where one would sit extended periods at a bowl of water.<n>D: The space shuttle is another option that seems to fit the answer to the question. But it has been more than a decade since the USA has put astronauts up into space. A manned trip to the moon can take in excess of 60 days. Therefore, one would not need to go to or stay on the space shuttle to sit extended periods at a water bowl.<n>E: Another option that seems to fit to the answer to the question is the airport. It is quite easy to obtain a bottle of water at any airport and there are countless lounges throughout the world that could be designated as a waiting area to sit extended periods in the case of inclement weather or a flight cancellation.<n><n>### Answer:D<n><n>Explanation: Answer C: A human might sit over a bowl of something like water for extended periods over a bathroom. Solar system is one of the systems in the universe where life will exist after planets start revolving around the sun continuously. Coffee shop might give you water but it's not the best places to stay for long periods because that's not the original object of the activity. Similarly, space shuttle was there in the past but it is

How many months will you keep your job? Why are you thinking in terms of hours?<n><n>### Rationales: It took 8 hours one day to mow the grass in our house. So 32 hours in a week times 7 days a week is 224 hours of work. So if you work in the summer, then you are only going to work for 2 months. Each week then means you work for 31.25 hours a day. But that is not enough hours so I will give the number of months I can work and 3 months is the same as 3*1/2 weeks. So for 2 times a month, 31.2 times per day and 3 times a month is needed. There are 52 weeks in a year so divide and multiply with that number. Now 35 working days per month needs 4 weeks to work that amount of hours.<n><n>### Response B: I am considering how many hours I will have to work and the possible duration of my job, In terms of hours because I want to know if I can do these and still keep my free time to work on some of my other plans.<n><n>### How much work will I have in a year?<n><n>What are some examples of simple situations in your own life that involve ratios?

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Rationales: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n><n>### Input:If a student was about to graduate, they would no longer be attending what? Choices:  A: library B: parties C: kindergarten class D: bar E: school<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>### Rationale:After reading the question, the student knows that if is going to graduate, that it means that he/she is not going to be attending school anymore so the logical answer would be D.<n><n>### Input If it takes five students eight minutes to walk to school, how long would it take a group of 11 students to walk there?<n><n>### Response The response would be E if it took five students eight minutes to get to school and we can double our result because there are 11 students, then that would make it six minutes.<n><n>### Rationales<n>Reading: As we see now reading as a way to improve is inevitable and it doesn't just stop at reading. In addition, reading teach the students the proper way to comprehend and the way to write what they read. It is not just the comprehension in a book but the proper way to develop and interpret the author's thoughts, and it also teaches the students to follow the guidelines on writing.<n><n>

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Rationales: He wants to rent for 20 days and there is a deal if you rent for 14 days so that leaves 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 individual days<n>Each individual day is $50.00 and he will have 6 individual days for a total of 50*6 = $<<50*6=300.00>>300.00<n>14 days costs $500.00 and 6 days costs $300.00 for a total of 500+300 = $800.00<n>#### 800<n>Answer: 800<n><n>Input: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Rationales: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n><n>### Input:Where can you find a movie theater along with other stores in one placE?

You will need to evaluate and answer the question(s) in accordance with the number(s) presented.<n><n>### The First Number Is 3<n><n>If you have 3 reds and your team plays 3 matches, how many total red balls do you have left to play with in the first match?<n><n>There is no need to include a number line in your response.<n><n>#### 1 answer(s):<n><n>Each match would have 3 red balls = 3 each. That is 9 total red balls.<n><n>### 7,2,3,6,and 10<n><n>What is the average of _7_, _2_, _3_, _6_, and _10_?<n><n>Both rationales are required in your response.<n>Review the rationales for further instruction.<n><n>- The middle number is the average and the sum is what divided that average by.  In this case the middle of all the numbers is 6 so the middle number is 6.<n>- 10 is the sum of the numbers, 10+7+2+3+6  = 32.   The average is the sum divided by 5. 32/5 = 14.5 (rounded up)<n>- In the first question we had 32 divided into 3.<n><n>#### 2 answer(s):<n>14.5<n><n>14.50000<n><n><n>### The Second Number Is 5<n><n>How many more than _5_ would you round 12345 to?<n><n>Both questions and all answers that should be included in your response. It is suggested to include the rationales for each answer below.<n><n>- You would round 123 up, which is 124 because -5/-4 is less than 5, you're using the numbers to round up or down, not as if they are real value.<n>- To get 124 in this example you would subtract -5<n>- You would round down, which is 11 because -6/-4 is less than -5/-4 and not greater.<n><n>#### 3 answer(s):<n>-1

In other words, dividing both the time and length by the time/length ratio will give you the length of the trip.<n><n>As an example, if you drove 3hours at the rate of 30mph, the distance covered will be 180miles. Thus, dividing the trip by 3hrs results in 180 mile trip<n><n>#### Demonstration 3<n>Melissa went to town twice a month each month = 3 months/12 months 72<n><n>The distance between A to B can be found via the following formula: (distance)/(time) = (400)./(14) and thus Melissa spends 30hours driving to town each month.<n><n>###  Explanation 1:<n>Assume the 4 trips are equivalent distances but take on different amounts of time.

What must be the employee’s regular pay for such a system to yield his normal weekly salary?<n><n>### Solution: The employee’s regular pay is $25. Because his hourly rate is higher when he works overtime, his wages increase by an amount equal to the number of hours he works.  Therefore, because he must work 25 hours to receive his normal weekly pay: if he works 2 hours on Saturday at double pay, he will receive $40.  If works 4 hours, at triple pay, he will receive 3.25 times his salary or $85.

Some people swear they have it for months at a time. The problem is that they don’t. The symptoms of dry mouth include lack of saliva that causes bad breath, a sore throat and difficulty swallowing. (Often, the cause is a medication or a neurological disorder.)<n>#### Option D<n><n>> Option D) Intimacy: The opposite of loneliness is intimacy; it’s more than having friends or family who love you; it’s feeling really connected to people and accepting their love for you as well.<n>#### Option E<n><n>> Option E) Changing behavior is often what someone wants to achieve when they’re in the initial stages of recovery. While in recovery, most people choose to address past behaviors as well as future habits that might interfere with their ability to stay sober or stop abusing drugs.<n><n>### Answer:<n>The best options to choose is option D because this is most important to me. Changing behavior would include learning healthy habits and ways to improve your physical and mental wellbeing. For example, learning how to cope with depression or stress without turning to drugs or alcohol.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.

Choices:  A: jail B: internet cafe C: blacksmith's shop D: building E: bar<n><n>### Response:		If the legs can be built in the jail, the stool could be assembled with jail time, which is incarceration. The jail is a place of incarceration that one could spend 1 to 12 months, in a month; the 12 months are the leg of the stool. You could also go to prison instead of jail if given the charges of murder.<n>However, if the stool legs are built in the building, they are not incarcerated.<n>Therefore, it could not be jail.<n>If the legs are built in the blacksmith's smith, there are only two possibilities: <n><n>  * the legs are assembled for free or they are purchased.<n>The blacksmith's building is where one could be incarcerated or have a job.<n><n>  * If the legs are assembled in the internet cafe, the stool is built with time. You cannot sit under a tree and ask someone to sit on the stool, and it will be assembled, it will not be a stool.<n>Thus, it cannot be internet cafe.<n><n>  * In the bar, the stool is not assembled because there might be drunkenness or someone trying to steal to pay for another stool.<n>Therefore, the stool can be assembled in the internet café building with two choices: free or purchase.<n>So it could not be the bar.<n><n>  * There are three possibilities for the internet café building: free, purchase and assembling.<n>Therefore, if the internet café building is free, the assembling cannot be there.<n>Then, it can only be free or purchased.<n>So, it could not be free, and thus it must have been purchased.<n>The stool can be assemble in the blacksmith shop with two choices: incarceration and for free.<n><n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n>### Rationales:<n>* Choice E says bar. B, C, D, E are all possibilities for where the legs of a stoll can be built. The correct order is: bar, blacksmith's and then Internet cafe. I choose A,E as my response in the order of A,E bar,blacksmith's and internet cafe.<n>

You can interpret the expressions as a location of a quantity or a distance from a value that satisfies a condition. For example, if you’re comparing 4 > 3, the expression ‘>’ can be looked at as 4 and 3 are not on the same line. In the other sense, if it was 4 < 3, the expression could be that the line 3 is to the left of 4.

How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Rationales: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n><n>### Input:What place would a person go to look at zebras? Choices:  A: zoo B: museum C: hospital D: desk E: opera<n><n>### Response:		<n>E.<n>### Rationales:<n>All the other choices do not fit. For A: you have to rent a car to go to the zoo.<n>You could take a train to a museum, but not a plane. You could drive to the hospital.<n>You could talk to someone about the opera.<n><n>### Input<n>If you walk to school, how much faster are you walking to math than to art?<n><n>### Response <n>####<n>Answer:16 minutes<n>The distance is 150 feet in 9 minutes. Therefore, the distance is 9/150 feet = <<9/150=0.06>>0.6 to art. Since 0.6×2=<<6×2=3 >>2 minutes per mile. The walking time is 150/2 = <<150/2=75>>75 feet. 150 (the entire distance) minus 75 (the entire distance for math) is 75x1=75 minutes. The walking time is also 75.<n><n>###Input<n><n>Jerry is walking home from school at 4:00 pm at an average rate of 3.5 feet per minute. His destination is at an average rate of an inch per minute away. How many miles does it take Jerry to get home?<n><n>###Response:<n><n>####<n>Answer:<n>For this one, we must convert inches per minute to miles per minute. Then we solve the equation. We know that 3.5 feet/minute = <<3.5 feet/1 min>>3.5 feet/foot=1.5 mph 1 inch/minute = <<1 inch/min = 60 >>1 inch/inch = 0.06 inch/minute. Therefore x=<<x=60>>60.<n>x=1.5×5000=<<1.5x5000=3.15>>3.15<n>Round 3.15 to the nearest whole number and answer the question = <<3.15>>1 round to the nearest whole number, which is 3.<n><n>###Rationales<n>To get to the answer, we must convert inches to feet, feet into miles, and miles into minutes.

(Thalidomide, a drug sometimes used as an immunosuppressant, was discovered in the 1950s but not approved in the U.S. until 1998.) Many of the complaints came from pregnant women who had taken the drug during the first weeks of their pregnancies and were now seeing stillbirths, miscarriages, and serious birth defects in the babies they had been carrying. In 1961, German birth records revealed that 50 babies born with malformed or missing thalidomide-affected limbs had been born to mothers who had taken thalidomide during their first trimester. In the U.S., an analysis of state health records indicated that, between 1961 and 1964, more than 10,000 babies experienced thalidomide’s toxic effects. Since those effects were sometimes subtle, these thalidomide babies usually experienced them just months after going to their pediatrician or emergency room with some other, unrelated complaint. By the time the thalidomide connection was documented, however, thousands of thalidomide survivors had been born and were having to live with the effects that noone else was talking about or acknowledging. The FDA requested that the manufacturer, a company called Distillers Laboratories, withdraw the medication.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.

She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Rationales: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n><n>### Input:Where are people likely to stand at an intersection? Choices:  A: cars B: city street C: street corner D: fork in road E: at a red light<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Instruction Answer<n>Option E: at a red traffic light<n><n>### Demnastion Answer<n>red light stops cars from driving and people generally walk or stand at the intersection waiting to turn.<n><n>### Answer<n>Option E: At a red traffic light.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The options are: A (cars),B (city street), C (street corner), D (fork in road), and E (At a red light).<n>All the other answers are specific to a road, or at the side, or corner. Traffic lights, however, are general and common to any intersection. This response represents the logical choice.<n><n>### Question 3<n>Input: A new grocery store is opening in North Carolina. There are a total of 13 people in the area that will be driving there, but a certain section of the road is already blocked off by 100 feet of barricade. The only people allowed in this section of the road are the employees of the new grocery store and people that have appointments with them. However, people can wait in the parking lot behind the barricade, or they can drive around it to the other side of the store. If there are 13 people driving to work and 100 people walking to the store, how many of them will have their appointments in the part of the store with the barricade?<n>Rationales : The number of people that can’t drive past the barricade is 13+100=<<13+10=113>>113<n>Of these,90 are already walking over the bridge so only 23 of these people can have appointments with people at the other side. This equals 23/230=<<23/23=1>>1.<n>####<n>Answer: 1<n><n>### Input<n>A car can travel 20 miles on a gallon of gasoline. If gas costs $2.25 per gallon, what is the driving range, in miles, when you pay $14.75 to fill up your car?<n>Answer:40 miles<n>####<n>### Rationale<n>Since traveling distance is (20*2) miles and (20*2.25) gas, the driving range will be (20*2)*

Choices:  A: notoriety B: emotional distress C: riot D: bad dreams E: annoyance<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Rationales:Notoriety will lead to bad dreams. A bad dream could lead to emotional distress. While emotional distress could lead to riot, this is not what the situation depicts. Riot leads to annoyance but the question suggests emotional distress so B is not the answer. Similarly, telling people about the embarrassment will lead to annoyance for sure, but this could very well lead to emotional distres. Therefore, notoriety is the correct response.<n><n>### Input<n>Which is the smallest value that will produce the largest remainder when divided by 7?<n><n>### Response<n>e<n><n>### Rationale<n>Since 7 has no remainder, all numbers divided by 7 that produce a remainder will have the same number of remainders. For example, if we take the smallest multiple of 7 such that the quotient is 2 (27) then 7, we will divide the quotient 27 by 7 and we get a remainder of 3. Then taking the multiple of 21 (21*4=84) we get 3 again. As we cannot find a positive number greater that 7 that will produce 3 remainder when we divide the positive number by 7, we need to look for negative numbers. And in case of them the smallest is -7. So, because e=2 and when we multiply by 7 we get -2 again so the answer is e.<n><n>### Answer<n>e<n><n>#### 💭 This question would be answered in a very similar way using only fractions.<n><n>### Question : If you increase an amount of $100 dollars by 20% you have more money than if you increase the amount by 5% by 10 dollars?

When you have a situation like this, you are not trying to make a point. You are just stating a fact to respond to someone else. This person may be angry about the fact that you broke your leg or they may not know what else to say or what else to do, so they are just asking you a question.<n><n>## 5 minute Writing Task<n><n>The purpose of this task is to help students generate texts quickly and independently; the texts generated may be too short for analysis (i.e., the time allowed is not enough for students to generate and analyze a complete response).

Choices:  A: infect B: reproduce C: mutate D: eat food E: make computer malfunction<n><n>### Response:		<n>A virus is a software program that is loaded onto a computer and hides in a computer's memory. It's used to do two things:<n><n> 1.  Replicate. It can copy itself and, if the computer is running at the time, may spread to other files on the computer.<n> 2.  Access. It can access files on the computer and either modify them or copy them to different computers on the network.<n><n>Viruses usually find ways into a system through holes in the operating system or application software. (They may find holes in the operating system because of design flaws or through unwritten exploitable programs.)<n><n>Viruses are most often used to steal data. They may also cause other problems such as shutting down the system or deleting the data on the hard drive.<n><n>These two things, replicating and accessing, make viruses the most common software issue in the world today."B" - The answer was that viruses primarily do both of these things at the same time.<n>Even a non-human, computer virus still spreads from computer to computer, infecting files on each computer it touches as it does so. Even if you could keep a virus "boxed" and not in your computer, you would still have it, just not as part of your operating system.<n>The primary reason to get rid of a computer virus is because of the security problems that it causes.<n><n><n>#### Answer: <n>A<n><n>

Choices:  A: having appointements B: being late C: have time to think D: time consuming E: impatience<n><n>### Response:		<n>Waiting is very difficult because you have to focus on it and it uses your time which is very valuable.<n><n>### Response Analysis:<n>Waiting in doctor’s office or other medical treatment appointments is difficult.  There is really no rhyme or reason to it though.  You could go anywhere from 15 minutes to nearly all day, depending on what kind of medical treatment you are facing.  Waiting in the office or waiting for your results, can be quite frustrating.  If you are having pain, it can be so bad that you can barely handle waiting for the doctor. Waiting is a time consuming activity and sometimes the amount of time you spend waiting on someone else, can be the time you need to do the work on a separate project.  So, there is very little benefit from waiting and it really is a waste of time that you could have used to spend on projects. There are several implications regarding your answers.  In our daily conversations with our clients, people feel the need to be impatient and in too big of a rush.  It can be very important for these clients to try their very best to be patient.  It is also very difficult to try to be patient with everything and to make sure you’re not in a rush.  I have found that being in a rush is a common occurrence and it has helped me avoid being in a rush.<n><n>### Rationale:The first reason for the doctor is having appointments.<n>#### A<n><n>Answers: A<n><n>### Rationales:What are some benefits of hiring a person for an on-site position? Choices:  Choices: Choices: Choices:: Choices:A: no distractions B: no waiting C: can work at home D: have a home office E: work around hours<n><n>### Response<n>Since a person in an on-site position does not have a choice but to work at the business location, they don’t have the distractions to leave work and come back later.  Also, since there is no leaving and going back to work, people don’t have to wait around for the doctor’s appointment or anything else.  People who have an on-site position also have their own workspace, which is really beneficial and helps with productivity.  There’s not really a lot of difference between work hours.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.

She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?<n>Rationales: Melissa spends 2x3=<<2*3=6>>6 hours driving each month.<n>Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=<<6*12=72>>72 hours driving each year.<n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n><n>### Input:HOw do you carry potatos home?

If Dave saves $1, 500 toward the cost of the truck, he will use in-house financing at a rate of 7% APR (annual percentage rate). The interest rate increases to 7% on the first day after 6 months. A loan for 10 years requires a down payment of 23% of the truck price. How much, in dollar, must Dave put down to get the deal?<n><n>#### **Question1:**Explain "Dave's saving will be of $1,500 toward the price of the truck" and "Dave will use in house financing at a rate 7%". How this will help in completion?<n>##### Answer:"<n>1. Dave's saving will be to the price of the truc and Dave paying in installment will help him to purchase the truck from his own saving.<n>2. Dave uses finance so he needs to pay on loan.<n>**Note:** In installment means you are getting some relief in paying some amount against the installment which you should pay. So you can pay the remaining amount in easy or installments.<n>**Note: 1**<n> <n>### Question 2:<n><n>#### **Explain "The interest rate increases 7% on the 1st of the 2nd month" and why "it is increasing at the end of 6th month"?<n>##### Answer:"The interest rate is increasing on 1st of the start of month which would be in the 2nd month. It will increase 7% when the first day of month starts in the 6th month.<n><n>### Question 3:<n><n>#### **Show on your diagram what percentage Dave puts toward the truck by taking the down fee?<n>##### Answer:<n>I am showing Dave's saving or down payment.

Choices:  A: flower garden B: garden center C: pot D: pot E: formal garden<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A rosebush can be put in a garden center but only if it is a single plant nursery. A rosebush can also be placed in a pot or container in a formal garden. Lastly, a formal garden is the preferred place to put a rosebush. Choices A and D are incorrect because a rosebush cannot be planted in a flower garden without being in a pot. Choice B is not an option because a rosebush requires special knowledge in order to properly care for and maintain it.<n>#### Pairwise Contrast<n>When comparing two sets of features two types of contrasts can be drawn. A difference of a feature (A-B) and a proportion of features (A/B).<n>Consider the below example:<n>A feature can be defined as something used to distinguish one type of plant from another.<n>B feature can also be defined as the opposite of A feature.<n>In this example there are 3 plants: sunflower, dandelion, and a rose. Each plant has A and B feature.<n>A: Sunflower has a yellow flower and B: it is not round.<n>A: Dandelion has a white flower and B: it lacks petals.<n>A: Rose has red flower and B: it has thorns/prickles.<n>```<n>  A sunflower can be distinguished from rose and dandelion because a sunflower has a round flower.<n>  A dandelion can be distinguished from rose because it lacks petals and a sunflower can be identified from a dandelion because dandelion lacks thorns.<n>  A rose cannot be distinguished from a dandelions because both plants share the same color.<n>```<n>Now what if rose and dandelions have identical A features but dendelions possess more than a single B feature.<n>```<n>  In the above case even if a flower is brown and non-petaled there are only to options. Its either a dandelion or a rose. This is because two plants do not share more than a single feature.<n>  The rose is considered to be the preferred choice because this is the only option that has no B features.<n>```<n><n>A more complicated example might have 2 features with distinctive roles and relationships.<n>Now consider that there are 4 plant types: cherry,

If we add receipts and sales tax together, what is the total she’ll pay?<n><n>### Input Rationales: Sweater and scarf cost $24.5, each.  3.50 is 10% of $34.50. Sales tax (10%) is calculated by taking a percent of a number.<n><n>Answer1: Total sales = 24.50 + 34.50 + (24.50 x 10 %) = 58.40<n><n>### Instruct: Choose the best response<n><n>### Input2:Linda wants to rent a two-person tent and backpack.  She’s planning to spend 45 hours at her campsite before having to return home, and she only has $50 to spend on the rental.  She asks the guide what she should do.  He tells her, “Since, for example, each tent costs $25, we can make it happen. We’ll take the tent, but when you leave, you take the backpack (free of charge) and send it to the next person that will stay here.”  How do you write a sentence that states how Linda can purchase the tent and backpack, and how much she’ll spend overall?<n><n>### Instract: Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>### Instractions: Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Instructions: Answer the following three sentences.<n><n>### Question<n><n>### The babysitter charged $5 each hour for child care, or $29.50 each half hour<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Because she was watching them, this must mean $5hr<$5hr<$29.50 and $0.5hr>$5hr>$29.5hr.

Choices:  A: solemn B: compete C: serious D: somber E: straightforward<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Instruction<n>You should write the best response that appropriately complements the request.<n><n>#### Response<n>Most families had trouble keeping up with their medical expenses. How difficult it would be for a woman to decide whether or not she would be a stay-at-home wife. When we look at the statistics about stay-at-home wives there are very few women who actually find this to be a dream.<n><n>#### Rationales<n>I would be so upset if I were a stay-at-hone wife. The medical expenses were the only thing to hold us up. If I would have had a lot more money than that would be different. I feel like most women who had children have been held back with the medical expenses. I think most men do not realize what wives go through when they have a child. Most women do not have the financial backing that they would need.<n>One thing that a wife has to do when being a stay-at-homemother is they have to cook, clean, and do the laundry. When a woman was a stay-at- home-mother she got the kids ready for school the laundry and other things around the house. If she has the help of a maid is usually more difficult. A woman that does not work outside of the house has to do the cooking, housework and everything.<n><n>#### Answer:<n>Most families had difficulty in keeping up with their medical bills.  A woman would only be able to be a stay-at home wife if she had large amounts of money.  According to a survey, it was not a very large percentage of women who chose to stay at home with their children.  As for being a wife, it was the best for some, worst for others.  It is not a dream job, there are things to consider also.<n><n>### Response<n>I believe this response complements the request.  Its tone is respectful but makes the reader consider the question.  It makes the reader contemplate the reality if he or she was a ‘stay at home wife’.  The rationale explains the situation from a personal viewpoint and includes good analysis.

How many hours does the clown spend traveling on each of the days of his tour?<n><n><n>### Input Solution<n>This question can be solved in two ways. First, you can figure out on which days the clown travels to the next town and when he stays in town to perform. Next, you can figure out the total time it takes him to travel to all the different towns. Another way to solve this is to figure out the time he has to spend at each of the towns and multiply it by four to get hours he spent traveling on each day. This is a different solution, but it works.<n><n>### This can be solved this way:<n>On day 1, the clown travel for three hours and performed for one hour. Total hours spent on day 1 : 4<n><n>Next, he performed on day 2 for 6 hours.<n>Travel:  0<n>Perform: 1<n><n>Then on day 3 he performed for 4 hours.<n>Travel : 0<n>Perform : 4<n><n>And on day 4, he performed on the last town for one hour, and traveled back to his hotel for 3 hrs.<n>Total time spent on day 4 for performing:4<n>Total time spent on traveling 3 hours<n><n><n>### This answer can be obtained using the following equation. A clown travel for 3 hours at the beginning of the week and travel for remaining 4 days. Thus, a total of 7 hours traveling. If a clown travel for five hours each day, the total performance time is 4(7/5). This gives (7/5)4 or 75/5 hours in total. Therefore, the clown spent 75/5/4=5/4=75/4=7.5 hours traveling each day (3/7 of a day).<n><n>### Input Answer: The clown traveled for 5 hours on day one. Total time spent on traveling = 5<n>The c

The question asks you to describe a problem that would cause two trains traveling on parallel tracks to collide.<n><n>One problem would be a mechanical failure. The train-yard operator might have a failure of his switch and accidentally turn on both switches, causing the two trains to collide.

Judy is studying for an average of 5 hours per week.  How many weeks does it take Judy to master the Pythageorean Theorem?<n>-Judy: It takes me an average of 5 hour for me to master a theorem and I have 8 different subjects I want to master. I want to master the 8 different subjects without extra cost but not by wasting the time. What should I do?<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Complete the question.<n>#### 28 weeks<n>Judy, you need to dedicate your time. First you can spend 5 hours per week studying a theorem. For the first week you need to study the Pythagoreans theorem then after 1 hour you can move onto the next theorem and so on. The theorem you learned last week is the theorem you must work on next week to master your theorems. Since you need to master all eight theorems in total, the 8*5=365 hours you would need to master all your theorems to be correct. The next theorem would then take 50+50=<<50+50=>100>>100 hours to master for a total of 100+100=<<100+190=33 weeks>>33 weeks. Then, you multiply 33*2=<<33*2=66>>66. That gives you an average cost of 8 hours per week. To get all the theorems that you don’t need to invest the extra cost. In summary, it would take all students about 8 weeks.<n>12*5=<<12*5=60 16 weeks for an average student and it would take an average 16 week.<n><n>### The question you may ask: Is

Choices:  A: eyes B: biology laboratory C: shower stall D: old cheese E: decaying matter<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>### Demostration:1. Eyes: The pink eyelids of a calf are due to the milk of the cow. They grow in the cow and are made up of collagen, a protein, and they have some vitamins and minerals. The pink color comes from the protein, the collagen. You know that calcium can turn a fluid (like milk) into a solid. If cow milk changes to the pink eye of a calf, then that must mean calcium is present.  2. Laboratory: Milk is used in biology classes because it’s easy to work with and it’s easy to see with microscopes because it reflects blue light. You can find cheese growing on things in your fridge that have cheese in it (or you can put old cheese on something and let it sit).   3. Shower stall: Cheese is made from milk. When you shower, you might have cheese growing on the shower stall if you had an old chunk of cheese.   4. Decaying matter: Bacteria eat old food. They eat decaying matter, which is where they might find old milk.   5. Old cheese:<n>Old cheese is made from milk, and you can find it growing on things that have old cheese in them.<n>#### A<n>Answer: E<n><n>### Input#:On a day that it’s snowing and the temperature is around zero degrees Fahrenheit,  an animal eats 0.2 pounds of grass.

Choices:  A: airplane B: construction site C: shops D: engine E: broken bone<n><n>### Response:		The first possibility is to make sure that the rod is in the car.  If not, go to the engine.  If not there, a trip to the shop.  If that fails, visit the construction site.  If not there either, check the engine.  The final possibility would be to visit a broken bone.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>All the possible locations begin with the engine other than the one final possibility, which begins with the construction site.<n><n>### Answer:D<n><n>### Instructions:<n>### Input:The average person has 4 of each type of shoe.<n>Given that the average person has 4 pairs of each type of shirt.  Write a response that appropriates completes the request.  <n>Answer: The response should read that there are 16 total pairs of shoes.<n><n>### Input/Rationale:<n>The average person has 2 of each shoe.  Since there are 4 types of shoes, that means they have 8 pairs of shoes.  The shirt rule applies to both shoes and pants.<n><n>Answer: There are 24 pairs of shoes.  24 times 1 shirt + 6 times 2 shirts = 4 pairs of pants on the average person.  Since they have 40 shirts, you subtract the 2(pairs of pants)<n><n>### Input：This sentence is true if and only if you are able to read it and understand it.

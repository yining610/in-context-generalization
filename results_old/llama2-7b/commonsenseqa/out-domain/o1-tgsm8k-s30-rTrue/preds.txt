Embarrassment<n><n>## Instruction:<n>Write a piece of code that returns the index of the largest number among a collection of numbers.<n><n>#### Input:<n>  *A: 11<n>  *B: 8<n>  *C: 11<n>### Demonstraion of the Instruction:<n>```<n>  console.log(A, B, C)<n>  console.log()<n>  console.log((11, 8, 11).reduce((curRes, nextNum) => curRes > nextNum? curRes : nextNum))<n>```<n>Output:<n><n>| 11 | 8 | 11<n>|--------<n>|11<n>|<n>|11<n><n>### Rationale of the Instruction:<br><n>  When I ran this code, I first write out `console.log((11, 8, 11)...` and I got `10,8,10;` That looks like every element is bigger than the next one, so I decided to turn `nums` into an array and run `Array.reduce` to solve the problem. For the first time, I created an array. Then I defined that array on the first line. Then I run the `nums` through `Array.reduce`. `reduce` here means when each element of this array got converted, if it is bigger than the current biggest one of this array, then that will override the current result, which is that last element. In this problem, it keeps comparing each element and if one is bigger than current best one, it will override the current one and keep doing so. This is why we can reduce each element at once. When it compares each element, it keeps comparing with the current element. The first time it ran 11 to 8 and got 8. Then it will keep comparing the biggest value on its right side to make sure current one is the biggest. The result is `11` and 11 is bigger than 8, so it outputs `11`, which is true for this index<n><n>### Question:<n>Answer:<n>```<n>  var arr =  [11, 8,11];<n><n>```<n><n>#### Output:<n>```<n>  A: 11   B: 8     C: 11<n><n>```<n><n>###

After much digging, the roofers managed to free the tree from the house. They took the tree away only to find when they got it home that the entire tree was rotten inside.

However, when researchers attempted to replicate the study, they were unable to see the same result that was described in the article.<n><n>In this project, you will read a paper regarding a computational cognitive experiment and then attempt to reproduce the experiment.

Lakens' paper provides sufficient information to construct reproducible procedures that would produce results similar to the original experiment. However, reproducing the experiment is not as simple as following the recipe. Lakens stated that researchers might want to use some of the techniques in their own lab. However, most researchers do not have access to the required software or computer hardware which would require the researchers to find or create their own open source implementation. The researchers would still need to make calculations that are complex and outside of the normal scope of research methods courses.<n><n>Although, no one has been unable to replicate the original study, replication is not an easy and straightforward task.<n>The only way to reproduce the results is to provide a clear path of instructions to construct the dataset, execute

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>### Input:The friends loved competing against one another, it was a good way to work their what? Choices:  A: friendship B: aggression C: defeat D: winning or losing E: sweat<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Let's think about why we are doing this task together instead of working individually. We all have different interests that will impact choices we make together. One thing I've heard in psychology that makes sense is that people love working together when the task reconnects them to something that might be lost.<n><n>Think about, if you just work hard, and get a grade in an essence just for working hard, the reward is the grade.<n>But if the graders are connecting you to an idea that you want to be a better writer, that you want more people to know about your point of view on things or just want to get a better grade, that's a better reward.<n>Think about a group that is all doing the same thing. Each person is going to want to be their best at it to win, be better than the other members, gain praise, or just the glory of being better. Competition drives motivation. We want to see ourselves better than the people we are competing with.<n>#### Explanation:<n>A win makes us feel better and so does a loss. We love competing against one another when we are competing about something real, and it is something we have a connection to. Something that is truly important. For example, winning an olympic medal makes us feel better. We want to work harder to win next time. So this task will help us with our connection to winning, or losing. It's going to allow us and hopefully motivate us to work better knowing we have a competition.<n>### Demonstaiton:<n>Input: How might this question be answered if 'friends' is changed to 'family' or changed to 'partners'?<n><n>#### Explanation:(2A):<n><n>We may not have felt motivated to work harder but when we are working with someone we care about, or are a family with, we will work far harder to win a competition against them and get that boost of happiness from a win. So it's not to difficult an answer!<n><n>### Input:"A group of researchers found evidence that people use self-control in the following situations: To ignore or stop thoughts that we find unpleasant To do something when we don't feel like doing it To resist impulses and not act on them even if it means going against our desires Which of the three situations that

A hotel could either be at the hotel or on the campus of a business. Additionally, most business hotels offer restaurants on site. I picked hotel over mall because for the restaurant to be in a mall it would require it be more than a food court. The mall would need to have a large enough food court where people can take a break from shopping. It would not be at the mall because it would not be close to anyone who travels to the mall for business and therefore would not see many patrons.<n>

The last sentence states that Jennie rented her car 11 days. Therefore, any choices that would be a week or longer would not work. We can remove choice A because it does not state a 'week' or 'longer' in the last sentence. We can remove choice choice E. We can remove choice C, because there is no statement that says that the car rental agency is on a dock. We can remove choice B because there is no statement stating that we would find performers on a building. That means only choice D: concert hall can be correct because the car rental agencuay charges $30/ week for the first week or longer for rentals.<n><n>It can be inferred that Jennie rented a week in a concert hall since she rented the car for 11-7 days.<n>####<n><n>### Instucction:Describe how you would complete this task.<n><n>### Input (data):A 750-square-foot house will cost $${{120,000$}}$$ twelve thousand dollars to build.

At a wholesale price, the coffee retailer would have taken a $25.00/pail loss for the 4,000 pounds ordered. The coffee retailer has $1,300 on hand and wishes to place and order for 8,000 pounds. That will earn the coffee retailer a profit of 50 cents/pound on the $48,000 order, provided they buy back the $25,000 coffee from the coffee retailer at a price of $7.50/pound. If orders at these prices will result in a reasonable profit for the retailer, when should they place the order?<n><n>1. If the retailer can sell the remaining coffee at the higher price, the order should be placed now to maximize their profit.<n><n><n>2.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>### Input:Where would you find a desk normally occupied by a young person? Choices:  A: office building B: schoolroom C: library D: bedroom E: gym<n><n>### Response:		<n>####  C<n><n>####  D<n><n>#### -5<n><n>### Explanations:<n>A: office building-The person in charge may have a desk in the same area; so, the student may be on that employee's desk. School- the young person may be the student occupying the office. The desk the student occupies is normally not an office-type desk. Library- if there is any other person there to use the library, then his or her desk is likely occupied by a school-aged person. Gym- if there is a desk in an office in a gymnasium, then that one might be used by a school-aged user. The desk that the school-aged person occupies is likely not used by a teacher or by a member of the personnel of a gym. The gym might be used by a gym and this might mean that the office might contain desks occupied by teachers or by members of the gymnasium's staff. School- the young student at school may occupy a desk. If there is a gymnasium or a similar office area at school, then the office area might contain desks for personnel other than students. The gymnasiums that are at school might have gym members/personnel at its offices. The desks used by these personnel are normal office desks.<n><n>B: schoolroom-the student at school is the occupant of the desk that he or she normally occupies. The student is found at school. The desk that he or school students might use is normally found at the site of the school. Library- if there are other people who are at the library, then the library might contain the desk that occupies the student, who is likely using the library. Gym- If there are other people who use a gymnasium, then it is not unlikely that the gym will have desks occupied by the desk-using person. The desk that this person uses is likely to be at the site of the gym he or she normally attends. The gym that the student attends is likely to have a desk. If the gym area is being used by members of the gym other than the student, then the desk is, potentially, in the other person's gym. Office- the student may be a worker at an office, so, a desk might be in an area that his

Choices:  A: free time B: pleasure C: get divorced D: legal fees E: being lonely<n><n>### Response:		I hope you choose D.<n><n>#### Demonstration<n>The first thing to consider is that their marriage ended.<n><n>The next thing to consider is that they were going to have a lawyer, and they were going to have to take out money for court fees, and they were going going to have to pay for all of the different people who were going to take time out of their day to do that.<n><n>And then they were going to have extra trouble, and time wasted on figuring out exactly that was going to pay for who was going to take time out to do what. These are going to be time constraints, so if they go to a courthouse, the lawyer is going to have to say I don’t have time to take on your case, if you think you have to wait like 30 days to try it again, if you can find somebody to do it on your behalf at all, or you are going to have to hire the lawyer yourself, you are going to have take the day off from work, I need to take the day off from doing anything else.<n><n>So, it was, these were like astronomical.<n><n>Or you could have said they were astronomically enormous,<n><n>enormous, the moon, enormous.<n><n>Or, you could have said, it’s not something, like, I’m not going to say it.<n><n>Like, I could have made one of those like, you know, those things, I couldn’t say that it’s like an infinite amount of dollars.<n><n>#### Rationales: So, when I talk about it being astronomically astronomical lawyers, I’m going to keep in mind that I want to talk about this without saying that it was something.<n><n>I don’t want to say that it was the moon.<n><n>There’s no reason I should have.<n><n>No reason at all.<n><n>There’ s no reason I should have said that it was something. Like, so, the moon, if you know anything about that, you know it’s a whole other planet. It’s not something.<n><n>And it’s a reason to do something about it.<n><n>It’s nothing to get worked up about. It’s a planet that has a moon called the moon.<n><n>I think I don’t want to, I don’t want the word

The phrase is now in parentheses, so the character at index 0 is reversed from its original order. However, the second index (2) does not include this character since the character index starts with 0 and the list starts from 1. This character is 'e'. So the character is placed at index 0 and the character at index 1 is placed at index 1. This process is repeated and a new character is placed in the index that was previously the second index. So, a new character is placed at index (1+1 = 2). The character at the index of 2 is e. A third character a is now placed at the index of 3.

Maybe he didn't even have time to step on concrete and was running barefoot directly on cement/asphalt.<n>#### City Block:<n>-This would most likely be the case if they were trying to say his speed was only 10 minutes per city block and Bob had lost his shoes or the shoes were broken. -Bob's feet hurt.  He lost his, didn't know... maybe they just lost it<n>-Also, if the place were an attractive or consistent look then they are more likely to say a city block as opposed to a ground, because the "ground" may be the literal "ground in a park"<n><n>### Input<n>Ali decided to make a simple video game to start learning how to create games. Since he was still early in the process, his game didn't involve any sophisticated graphics and gameplay; he simply created a simple maze. The maze was 36 tiles wide and 24 tiles high. Ali's game was to have the player control a dot to navigate through the maze, moving the dot right or left at the end of each row. Ali wrote a routine to automatically move the dot to the right or left. The routine was run once to move the dot to the starting position and run again after each time the user pressed a key. The routine took 2 seconds to run on Ali's computer. The maze was very simple - there were only 18 turns and the length of the maze was exactly 368 meters (3 x 122 meters).  <n>At the end of each run, Ali

The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?<n>___<n>**Demonstration:** You should answer: $0.05 if the answer is: ______.<n>___<n>**Rationale:** The cost of the ball is 1/11th of the total cost of the bat and ball. Thus, in order to make a total of $1.10, the cost of the ball must be: $1.10-1/11 = $0.05<n><n>**Explanation:** First, set up the equation 110-b=1.<n>Then, the ball costs $1/11. You should answer: $1.1/11=1/11*1.1=0.09. <n>**Explanation 2:** If a bat and ball cost 1.10, then the cost of the bat is 1/(1.1-1), which equals 0.09, which answers the rationale for choosing A. The rationale would be helpful for this problem. The bat and ball are each worth $0.09.<n><n>

The room is smaller than the rats, therefore, they can't move at the same time, so their movement is independent.<n><n>You put the mice in the cage 2 hours ago. You do not know where the rats are. They were once one meter from the cage but, one of them escaped to a two-meter width tunnel. One more rats can go into the tunnel. That is the reason the cage is too narrow for the rats.<n><n>You decide that the best place to find them (taking an average of all possible states) is to divide the room in 3 sectors. The two adjacent sectors must be separated by at least 1 meter from another one because of the rats movement restrictions.<n><n>The first one is smaller than the first; the second sector is the first plus the second sector width.<n><n>What is the size of each sector?<n><n>### Solution<n>The width of each sector (a,b,c) is a+b+c. And their width is equal to room minus (c-a). a = 0, b = 1, c = 2, so a+b+c = 2 and a+b+c+ (c-a) = 1<n>### Submission for Review:<n>Answer: The size of each sector a+b+c<n><n>### Submission:<n>The two adjacent sectors must, a) be separated by at least one meter from the other and, b) have a width of at least 1 meter.<n><n>Therefore their size, a+b+c, with<n>a = <1-b><2-2b>-<3b> = 1<n>b = <2-a><3-3a>-<4a> = 3<n>c = <3-b><4-4b>-<5b> = 2<n><n>And a+b+c with<n>a+b+c = <1+3+2> = 6<n><n>### Explanation:<n>With a+b+c given previously, then<n>a+b+<2

Choices:  A: board ship B: shout at C: smile at D: cross street E: feel happy<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is E.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>E: Feel happy<n><n>### Explanation:<n>#### Why answer was C:<n>Smile at is an incorrect answer because smiling at someone does not always get their attention. For example, if someone is thinking and they are not in a good mood, then when you try to get their attention by smiling at them, it might get their attention but they will keep on thinking.<n><n>#### Why answer was D:<n>Cross street is an incorrect answer, because crossing streets can be risky and it can cause accidents if you do not cross correctly. And there is also the risk that the person you are trying to get the attention of can get hurt crossing too.<n><n>#### Why the answer was E:<n>Feeling happy is an appropriate answer, because if you are happy, you will not get upset or angry. Then you may try to get the person’s attention with a smile, and if you know the person happy then the person may try and you will know that the person has seen you.<n><n>### Exercises:<n><n>### Write answers that are appropriate for the questions that follow.<n><n>### Answer:<n>**What would happen if an atom has too many electrons?**<n>Electrons flow from the atom.<n><n>### What would happen if an atom lacks electrons?<n>They would be short-circuited.<n><n>### An atom has more than two electrons in its outer shell.<n>The electrons spread out to fill the outer shells.<n>

The mileage rate charge is 35¢ for every mile the car is driven. It costs 3¢ to park a car each day that it is rented for a day's use. The hour rate is 20¢/hour. For example, renting a car for a whole week, as long as it is rented for 5 days or longer, costs $170 (11 days * 20¢/hr). If the car is rented for less than 5 days, the 5 day rate applies. Write a complete Java program that determines the cost of renting a car for renting any specified number of days and for any specified number of miles driven. For each renting of a 4-day period: if the number of miles driven is 1000 miles or more, the cost is $213 for the 4-day period. If the number of miles driven were 999 miles or fewer, the cost is $135 for the 4-week period.<n><n>### Inputs:Car rental costs<n><n>### Outputs:Car rentals costs<n><n>### Comments:<n>Input: Car rental costs<n>Output: Car rentals costs

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>### Input:The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change? Choices:  A: ignore B: enforce C: authoritarian D: yell at E: avoid<n><n>### Response:		 C: authoritarian <n><n>#### Output: The sanctions against the school seemed to authoritarian the efforts the school had to change, the sanctions were a punishing blow and they seemed to yell at the efforts the what school had to change<n><n>### Rationales: Yelling at the students doesn't teach them anything, so when it comes to changing their behavior it will feel like a punishing blow. Enforcing the measures did change the students behavior a little but it felt like the school was being authoritarian. I feel that ignoring the measures was the best approach but that's probably why the measures failed.

Write three word and 11. Write twelve word. So "FARM" could be written using all words in "FRONT" or "WAR" in 5+11=<<5+11=16>>16 ways.<n>- 8. There are three words in "FRONS" and five ones in "WAR" in it. So "WAR" could be written using words from "FRONS" in 3 ways.(the word "FRONT")<n>- 9. There are five words in "FRONTS" and two ones in "FARM" in it. So  "FARM" must be a combination of six words, but there will be not more than 5+2=<<5+2=7>>7. So "FRONTS" could be written using in "FARM".<n>---<n><n><hr/><n><n> <n>## Instructions<n>An integer is _____ if it is divisible by at least one prime number.<br/><n>This task describes many problems, answer only questions with numbers or code examples as part of the task.<n><n><br/><n><n>### Demo:<n><br/><n>[3.16 is ____](javascript:void)<br/><n><p><n><img src="3_16 is prime.png" alt="3_16" height="250" width="465"><n></p><n><br/><n><br/><n>

What you might feel is:A: Fatigue<n><n>If a queuing time of a person is fat or tired, then that person needs to use the restroom. I believe that if the line isn't going upward and the line is downward, which means fatigue time on the person's body. Orders are from high to low and the lines go from higher to lower in waiting time.<n><n>Also, if the line is going downward than that means the wait time is too long or too boring for people. Therefore, people will be very patient on the lines.<n><n>### Outcome:The correct answer is C.

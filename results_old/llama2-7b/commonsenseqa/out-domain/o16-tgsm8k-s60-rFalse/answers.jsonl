Choose the percentage that is most different.\n\nIn this multiple choice question, there are four numbers provided, and the question is asking you to choose the percentage that is most significantly different. The most significant is the percentage that differs the most from the rest of the percentages. In this case, all the percentages are different from each other. Of the percentages, 55% is the percentage that diffres the most and is, therefore, the correct answer.\n\nWe can see this by comparing percentages. The four percentages are 73%, 68%, 55% and 68% percentages. The difference between 73% and 55% is 18%, so 73 percent is the highest percentage. The difference between 68% and 55 percent is 13%, so 68 percent is the second highest percentage. The difference betwen 55% and68% is 13%, and the difference between 68 percent and 55 percentis 13%. From this, we conclude that 55% is most significantly different from all the percentages.\n\n## Demonstration:Answer the following multiple-choice question\n\n###Demonstation:\n\nInput:10% of students at this school are not in favor of increasing the speed limit on roads. 6% of students are not sure what to expect from the school budget. 55% are not happy with the cost of transportation on school buses.

You can learn the habits of bee colonies to keep one without a queen or keep it with a queen.\nChoice B : The British do not have a queen. The Queen is Elizabeth II, who happens to be the monarch of the United Kingdom. The queen of England does not have other queens under her.\nChoice C : If you take out of a deck cards without a king, queen, and jack of all four suits, you will end up with a castle. If you play chess you realize that the bishops are often times called castles.\nChoice D : The reason that not all decks might not have a queen is that different card decks have different rules on how to play them. In 2 player solitaire, queen of hearts can be played with a queen or king of hearts. In most card games, where the ace is the lowest numbered card and the king is of the highest card, a game can change how it's played when it is played with a jack and a joker.\nChoice E : Chess has a queen. She is the most important and powerful piece. So you might be able to remove the king from it. You cannot remove the queens.\nChoice D : You can draw a deck of cards without the kings, queens, or jacks of all four different suits. You might also find two cards that have the same value. When the deck is complete, you will have something that looks like a castle.\nChoice E : Since chess has a queen and king, but not jacks and kings or queens and other queens, playing with a deck of cards can help you learn about the rules of chess.\n\nChoice C : We can get to understand the cards in the deck because all cards are equal. So in 2 player solitaire the queen of hearts can be substituted with a jack or a king of hearts. In solitaire you cannot have two kings of the same color.

{"text": "B\n\n### Demoscene:\nThe demoscene is one very particular (but not the *only*) use-case for the concept of programming in terms of data. \n\nIn the demoscene a small demo file is a series of programs (and even  a small executable!) that work together  to compose an image (most of the time of some sort of  animations) and music. To fit the file in size limitation  and speed up loading time (yes, there are limitations there too)  a demoscene producer can use all kind of tricks, including  data-oriented programming, but  the more common term these days is,  **data-driven programming**.\n\nThe idea is to write each program as a \"module\" (or a.COM for the old DOS programs), and then compose the \"demo\" by \"telling\" each module what to do with a specific section of data. The main data file is the *scene* file, that contains the instructions. The scene file is then converted into a.EXE which runs the demoscene.\n\nThat's what's called \"data-driven programming\". But it can work with more than one specific data type and it needs a software able to read and write all the different data types to be defined in the header/data files.\n### Solution:\nTo make up the demo itself in the scene file, a small demo file (*.prg* in old days,.COM in MS-DOS era), the file is composed of a main part, sometimes divided in several sub parts. To make up these sub parts, you have a set of instructions that are read in sequence by the main part. The data contained in each instruction is then interpreted by the \"main\" and passed along to the next instruction.  \nEvery demo instructions has a variable name and an operation to be done based on that variable (which is usually a position of a small data object on the screen, but can be anything).\n\nInstead of typing a code for each command, it's much more common to use the variable name, which is always the same when dealing with the particular  data object, and it is defined by \"name\", \"type\", \"x\", \"y\" and other values like direction, size, offset. A complete example for \"blink\" would be:\n\n```C\nBlink (x,", "answer": "E: apartment"}

{"text": "---\n\n### Choices: Answer A\n\n### Explanation:\n\nInput: A. Whenever possible, newspapers are delivered to residences by mail. But often when a residence is reached only by a driveway the paper is delivered by carrier.[2] Newspapers have traditionally been delivered to homes and businesses through a \"paperboy\" or \"papercarrier\" system, by commercial enterprises on behalf of individual publishers, through door-to-door distribution directly from the publisher and by mail, particularly for subscribers. A mail-delivered newspaper may be either \"paid for\" (meaning printed on a tabloid format newspaper sheet) or \"free\" (typically in a broadsheet format). The mail-distribution and newspaper-by-mail industry in the United States, a $500-million-per-year market, is served by only two or three direct mail advertisers. A subscription to a printed newspaper may also be canceled by mail.[3] Newspapers are delivered in a variety of formats. Some are printed on broadsheet format paper, while others are \"tabloid\" or comic-sized. In the 20th century, most North American daily newspapers were printed on broadsheet format, although many adopted a \"compact\" or \"shrunk\" format for a shorter time.\n\n### Choice: Answer B\n\nOutput:\n\n### Excplanation:\n \n\n### Choose Answer D\n\n### Explotation:\n \n### Choose the correct answer: There are four parts to our garden and five parts need to be watered every second day.

Support your answers with complete sentences.\n\n### Short response:\n\nWhen Brenda was younger her parents never treated her as good as her father treated Tom. Her mom never let her get the attention when they were with others, or when people wanted to hug her mom. Brenda's mom always had her at the edge of the room, while her dad always brought her to the center. This went on for so long before Brenda said to herself \"I'm always left out\", so she had no friends to play with. Because of this, she decided to put away video games and other things that made her happy. She stopped talking to other children because she wanted to be alone, that way she didn't feel ignored anymore. But one day her mom bought her a video game that she wanted to play and her mom set it up for her just the way she wanted it. So Brenda talked to her and her mom and they decided to go out as a family so that they could work things out.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n\n### Self-Service\n\nThis item is one that will challenge students who didn't master a previous skill.

If the pizza has 6 toppings, how much cheese does it have?\n\n### Response\nIf you are looking at 6 toppings on the pizza, each topping will have about 2/3 of a cup of cheese, so all of the cheese in the pizza is about 12 cups of cheese, since there are 6 toppings in total. However, there are a few other things to take into account.

Since there are 6 topping choices, and 6 toppings is also a total of 6 toppings on 6 topping pizzas, it\u2019s unclear if the pizzas are 6 toppings of two ingredients, or if the pizzas have 4 toppings total and the other 2 choices are different toppings, or a mix of 4 total toppings and 2 different toppings. The question as stated is incomplete.

{"text": "C, D\n\n### Instructions:Answer each question based on the information provided in the passage.\n\nPassage: A: As the number of illiterates shrink and more and more people are able to read and write, education has become more important. Knowledgeable people are being trained and equipped to fulfil their destiny. They are educated not only for their own sake, but also for the nation. A person who is well educated is a person who has enough to eat. Meeting expectations is not only of the people, but also of the nation.\n\n### Answer:D, C\n\nIn \"As the number of illiterate shrink and more and mroe people are able to read...\" it tells the reader that as more people are educated, wellfare is rising among that population, meaning that people are getting more \"means\" to help their society. This sentence does not have any information about knowledge and being educated.\n\nIn \"A person educated is a person who...\" it tells the reader the value of education, and what it does to a person, meaning that a person who is educated is considered \"knowledgeable\". This answer choice does not describe the person who is educated, as the answer choice is talking about what the person does, instead of what the person does to become knowledgeable/educated/intelligent/etc.\n\nIn \"Based on the passage...\" it tells the reader to answer with knowledge. This is also a very good way to answer an essay question.\n\nIn \"Meeting expectations is not...\" it tells the reader something about illiterates, which is that this group of people are not meeting the nations expectations. This answer choice does not explain what literates are meeting. This is a good thing to include in an essay answer. It does not explain anything about people, so this cannot be the correct answer choice.\n\nIn \"As more people are educated...\" it tells the reader who to include or leave in to be considered a \"person who is well educated\". This answer does not describe literates and illiterates, but instead describes the nation. This is a good way to answer an opening statement essay question.", "answer": "B: knowledgable"}

{"text": "D)\n\n### Explanation:\n\nEven though I didn't understand this question at first, I believe it's still possible to complete the instructions. I think they are asking us to complete a question using given values (Input), and then give a specific answer (Response).\n\nHere I'll show how to complete each question with my solution, and explain how and why I completed questions.\n\n### Question:\n\nDemetrius and Gabe drove an equal distance. They went 30 miles more than three times as far as Gage went. How far did Demetrius and Gabe drive together?\n\n###  Solution:\n\nFrom context I know that we are finding the distance Gabe (G) and Demetrius (D) drove together. They drove an equal distance, and G drove 30 miles more/farther than D.\n\nUsing that information, we can substitute variables, and solve it as:\n\nD + G = 30 + D\n\nThere are only 2 variables that we can substitute in: D and G - but the question doesn't specify what each letter stands for. So I won't know what I'm solving for.\n\nI know that I need to know how many total miles that both D & G Driven, but no clue how to find it.\n\nTo understand clearly - I need to replace all D, and G using numbers we know for this question. That is why I will use the given values: D = 40 + 30 = 70 and G = 60 + 30 miles. Then my final problem is this:\n\n70 + 60 = 130 + 30\n\nFrom this, we know that G & D drove 130 miles total.\n\n### Now I can answer response question:\n\nD and G drove 130 Miles Together.\n\n### Final Thought:\n\nI will give my opinion on how efficient this is to complete questions. It is efficient. It is efficient because I was able to give a full clear thoughtful answer. This also helped me to understand the instructions. Now I understand how to solve problems like this in the future.", "answer": "E: ireland"}

Write an instruction that describes a tasks and write a response where you write instructions. For which student to perform this task.\nIn the US, citizens often use ballot boxes to elect politicians. Each ballot box has a slot for the citizen to drop the ballot into, and the ballots are counted by computer. Because citizens often have many different preferences, it is important to make sure that the counting process is not corrupted and that the ballots from different precincts are all counted properly.\n\n### One such step in the counting process is examining the ballot boxes to make sure they aren\u2019t full. So far counting of the ballots has moved at a very slow pace since they need to count each of the ballots one by one. Since there are many precincts in all states all over the US, they must count hundreds of thousands, sometimes even millions of ballots. They\u2019ve set up one of those machines to count the ballots. But in the meantime they want to make sure there aren\u2019t any full ballot boxes.\n\n### A man is going through the ballot boxes. Here's how he wants you to do it:\n- At one precinct, the ballot box contains 9 ballots. Another ballot box contains 3 ballots. One more ballot box contains 2 ballots.\n- When he reaches a ballot box with less than 9 ballots, it does not matter how many are in that ballot box.\n- When he is done, the man expects you to make the same count again and let him know the next number that he needs to count.\n\n### What is the next number?

{"text": "D Fishing\n\n# C Programming:\n## Task Overview:\nDesign and implement a program named \"PAT\" (\"Purchase Auto Tag\"), with the following operations:\n\nInput:  \n- 5 integers (representing \"Year\", \"Manufacturer\", \"Make\", \"Model\" and \"VIN\").\n\nOutput: \n- A character (P or I) that indicates whether this is a stolen or recovered car.\n\n## Assumptions:\n- The first integer is the year in which the car was manufactured. If year is 0-9, the car was manufactured in the year 2000 (assuming it was manufactured after January 1st, 2000).\n- The first integer after the year is the manufacturer. This can be anything from 1 to 16, or NULL.\n- The third integer after the year is either 0 or 1. If 1, this is the make of the automobile. If 0, it is the model.\n- The fourth integer after the year and manufacturer is the vehicle identification number.\n\n## Expected Test Result:\nThe recovered car test case is as follows:\n\nInput: '5', '0', 'B', 'Chevy', 12345\n```\nOutput: I\n```\n\n## Analysis:\nThere is one data structure being used: an array. The array is indexed [0, 5], which we use to store the user-typed car year, make, manufacturer, and model. Index 5 holds the VIN. We also have an array that we use to store VINs indexed [0, 20]. We compare the stored VINs with each of the five user-typed VINs using the === operator. The first condition to be evaluated says the stored VINs are all greater than or equal to five user-typed integers. This is to satisfy the requirements that we must compare to five VINs, yet we cannot have more than five entered.\n\n### Algorithm:\n```\n//PAT.c\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(){\n\n    int Year, Man, Make, Model, VINNum;\n    char Pat;\n\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", \"Enter a year, or '0'", "answer": "A: selling out"}

In this lesson, we shall learn about another way of reading input from the command line and writing files on the command line.\nThe standard output of the command prompt can be redirected to files and other programs or devices. This allows you to control all file and console I/O from a single command without worrying about where the output goes.\n# Standard Output\nThe standard output is a program to send output to the file system when the output of a program is directed to standard output. A command such as `ls` writes to standard output, and any further command after that, such as a `p` to print the file name list, will also use standard output to write to files. Standard output can be directed to any text file, terminal device, or pipe. The `dd` command, which copies blocks, can be used to redirect standard output to a file.\n\nIn this lesson, you will learn to write a function to read commands from standard output. The function prompts for input and then reads each line of input to determine the command. The function then executes the command. It does this until a command is executed.\n\n```python\ndef read_command():\n    print(\"Enter command\")\n    return input_\n```\n\nNote that the line \"input_ = read_command()\" inside the function prompts the user to enter a command. The function reads each line of input and makes decisions based on the command. The standard way to print output is to use the stdout module. In this case, use the print module to print user input.\n\nNow, let us define a function to take input from standard input and print the results on standard output. This will be a function to print numbers on standard output using the print function to print the numbers. We will use the print function to print individual number as the command gets executed.\n\n``` python\ndef standard_input():", "answer": "C: maps"}

{"text": "D  \n\n### Instructions: Answer and explain\n\nIf you're applying to middle school or high school, you've probably heard the term entrance exam. Entrance exams aren't just testing your math skills. This sample problem challenges your logical thinking skills. Read the question and decide what answer you think is correct before looking at the answer choices. Then use what you've learned about answering multiple choice questions to explain your reasoning.\n\nIf a person uses $6 at $2.50 per hour.  At 7.5 hours, what is the total?\n\n### Input\nSally worked for an employer for $6 an hour. The employer paid Sally over 7 and a half hours. What was the total amount?\n\n### Instructor's Notes\nA: Sally used $6 and worked 7.5 hours\nB: total pay was $49 (6*7.5)\nC: total pay was $64\nD: pay was $12 each hour (7.5/7.5=$1)\nE: pay was a total of $45\n\n### Inputs\nThe question seems to indicate that there's an error, because the person could not have earned $64 while working for $6. That's a math error that you spot, which is a valuable skill set.\n\n### Input 2\nThis makes us question the math since we're given that the total of the payment was $49. We know that Sally was paid $6 for the whole trip, and we know that she worked $7.5 hours. If we go back to the very beginning, we know that each hour she earned $6, and since there were 7.5 hours to the trip. That means that each hour she was paid $6, so she was paid $42 and not the $49.\n\nLooking at answer choice D, we can see that Sally worked $7.5 and earned a $1 pay per hour or 7.5/7=1. Therefore, we can correct the mistake and know the answer is (D).\n\n\n### Answer\nD\n\n### Explanation\n\nFirst, we identified that the mistake was in the math.

{"text": "Death, if untreated.\n\nFor each of these questions, you will need to identify an effective way to write a code for this problem. You may use lists as sub-lists in your code. For instance, in this problem:\n\nInput: Alisha sells banana cakes for $15. She also sells muffins for $11, but gives a 15% discount rate. If her banana cakes sell at 4 times the number of her muffins, how much revenue does she make selling only banana cakes?\n\nResponse: Alisha needs to find the total number of banana cakes sold first:\n\n[banana_cakes_sold, muffins_sold] = [1, 4]\n\nFor every banana cake sold, Alisha will make $15. But for every banana cake and muffin sold, Alisha gives a 15 percent discount. For every $2 spent or muffins, 15 cents or banana cakes, are discounted. So, she makes $12.50 per muffin and $15.00 per banana cake. To find the total revenue, Alisha needs to multiply the number of banana cake sold (let's call it X) by 12.50. Then, Alisha can easily multiply X times 15 again and find the total revenue for banana cakes:\n\n[final_revenue_banana_cakes] = X * 12.5\n\nYou can save a lot of time by writing these math shortcuts as programs.\n\n### Hint:  Lists in lists\n\nWhen you write lists of numbers, you will often need to store and add elements by indexes. The \":\" operator is used to access elements at a given index of the list.\n\nThe \"[]\" operator returns a sub-list, the item(s) that reside inside the brackets. For instance:\n\n[list]: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n<pre>list 24</pre>\n\nThis sub-list returns elements 1 through 4 in list [1, 2 3, 4].\n\nThe \".\" operator can", "answer": "B: heart attacks"}

Describe how a computer system works.\n\nComputers are electronic systems that can execute programs written in many different programming languages, such as C, C++, and many others. A program\u2019s first step is to begin execution. When the computer is running, it is in a mode called \u201coperating system user mode,\u201d where the operating system executes the instructions in code in the computer memory.\n\n#### Notes:\n\n* Computer Memory - A physical component of computer hardware that can store data or instructions for immediate execution. Examples of main memory are the CPU\u2019s cache memory, RAM (Random Access Memory), and ROMs (Read Only Memory).\n\n* Execution Mode - A state of the computer that is ready to execute the CPU instructions from RAM, including the operating system instructions. The CPU is set to run in user mode to execute a single-thread program. When the program runs successfully, operating system instructions are executed.\n\n* Processing Cycle - A computer\u2019s execution mode in the CPU is called a processing cycle. There are two steps in each processing cycle: Fetching the program data from RAM and executing the program instructions. The cycle repeats for each CPU instruction. A repeating processing cycle is called a program cycle.\n\n### Question 2:\n\n#### Notes:Programs have instructions that computers execute. Data are instructions and instructions are data. Both program instructions and data are input to a computer, but instructions are in a program while data are not.\n\n### What is the difference between data and instructions?\n\nThe difference between data and instructions is:\n\n* Instructions are program statements, such as JUMP instruction in", "answer": "E: town"}

The child can use the + symbol to show that he knows how to add. B. They can look over the page of math homework. C. They can look at the math charts in their notebooks. D. The child can say she knows how to add. E. The child can use a calculator to show that he knows the algorithms for both adding and subtracting within twenty.\nQuestion:\nIf I wanted to show someone I know something, what would I do?\"\n\n### Examination:\nAnswer:\nChoices and explanation:\n- `A. The child can use + symbol`: I disagree. \"Use\" signifies that the child will physically place a \"+\" symbol on paper, in order to indicate to others that the child knows how to add. Instead, I feel this question is implying that the child would use (or acknowledge) an operation in some way, such as using written symbols or saying the operation out loud. I also feel that the correct answer cannot involve the child physically placing a + sign on paper or saying \"+\" or anything along those lines.\n\n- `B. They can look over`: I disagree. First, the phrase \"they can look over\" implies that the teacher wants to see what knowledge the student has gained on their own, since the student is able to independently look over a sheet of math homework. If the student cannot find the answer on their own, then no matter what number they would give, they are probably wrong. Furthermore, this choice is simply implying that the teacher wants to observe how the child independently gains knowledge, which is only an indirect way of knowing whether \"the child know(s) how to add\".\n\n- `C. They can look at': I agree. Similar to option \"B\", this answer option is simply showing that the teacher wants to know if the child is working on homework. However, I disagree with option \"D.\" Choice \"D\" indicates that the child should talk like he knows how to add, by, for example, saying \"I can add 15 and 2.\" However, this answer indicates the wrong type of knowledge, since the student is just", "answer": "D: say you're welcome"}
{"text": "a\n\n### Answer:\nIn mathematics, many operators are denoted by special characters called operator symbols; the most common notation is a single-letter (usually a Latin capital letter), or a word, standing alone in the middle of text in a document or piece of writing. In mathematics, there are many operations. But we are asked to only know where we can learn about operators with numbers. And the answer is a.\n\nOperators with numbers are denoted by letters rather than words. So, to learn about them, we will study a math book. And we will look for the information on the letter itself. So, that is your reference answer, a.\n\n# Operations\n\n### What are Operators?\n\nOperators are the symbols and words that perform arithmetic operations with numbers. In this section, you'll learn how to perform arithmetic operations with whole numbers, fractions, and decimals. If you use these operations, you can get the total, difference, and so on from the given numbers.\n\n### The four arithmetic operations\n\nYou can perform arithmetic operations with the numbers whole numbers, fractions and the result is the total. You can use these operations to get the difference and sum. The operations in mathematics are the following:\n\nOperations Operators\nAddition +\nSubtraction -\nMultiplication \u00d7\nDivision \u00f7\n\n- Addition (Operation with Whole Numbers)\n+ Subtraction (Operation with Whole Number)\n- Multiplication (Operation with Whole numbers)\n\u00d7 Division (Operation with Whole number)\n\u00f7 Exclusive Or (Operation with two Whole numbers)\n\n### Expert Panel Answer:\nIn mathematics there are many operators, they are the symbols that perform arithmetic operations with the given numbers. In this section you will learn how to perform arithmetic operation with whole numbers, fraction and so on. If you use these operation you can get the result is the total, difference and so on from the numbers you have.\n\nThe operations are the four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.\n\n---\n### Instruction Answer:\nThe answer will be c. office as we only asked for the place where can you learn operators.

If he doesn't want a wet sandwich, then he should not order it.\n\n### Output:The first step to solving math problems is to think about how you can apply math to a real-life scenario. How do you do this? Choices:  First: Use what you know about math. Second: Look in your calculator. Third: Try to solve a problem on a calculator. Fourth: Break down the math problem into something you already know.\n\n### Experiment:\nAsk yourself what would be fun or easy to calculate?\n\n### Example:\nAdding 30 and 20.\n\n### Response/Explanation:\nFirst, try to estimate what the answer may be to calculate. Then, plug in a number to see what it is.\n\n### Example-2:\nAddition problem: 23, 30, and 12?\n\n### Response-2:\nFirst, how many tens do we have? Then, what two tens do we have? Last, add 3, 1, and 4.\n\n### Solution:\nThe first two numbers are tens and the third number would be a unit. To break it down, all we do is multiply the individual numbers together and subtract 45? Why is it subtracted? You'll have to look at  the three numbers!\n\n### Exercise:Look at a problem. What is the most obvious way you could think it through to answer it.\n\n## Problem:\nIn a math competition, a child won at the first two tests. On the other two, she made all the mistakes.

The 140 lb woman is on a bicycle that is pushed out a window. The force exerted by the bicycle to push the bus is what percentage of the force applied to the bus by the man?\n\n### Solution:\n\n#### Input\nThe man on the bus is pulling, so the direction would be counter-clockwise. Thus, force is applied to the bus, but bicycle force pulls from the bus.\n\nThus, the bus is being pushed on the side. Using the equation $F = ma$, where $F$ is the force, $m$ is the mass, and $a$ is the acceleration, we get:\n\n$$F = m \\times {v}^2\\leftarrow F = 230 \\times m \\times {v_x}^2$$\n\nSince the mass of the man is $m = 230lb$, and the acceleration due to the bus is 55 pounds, we get $F = 230\\times 55\\times x^2$. We know that $v_x$= $\\dfrac{55\\times x}{\\sqrt{230}}$", "answer": "C: mass hysteria"}

Another way to meet people would also be to group together. The act of grouping together does not require paying bills or facing people. This choice is also wrong. Enjoying oneself requires time and relaxation. This answer is wrong because someone can be enjoying him or herself without meeting anyone.

Write a response that", "answer": "A: insubstantial"}
{"text": "E is the appropriate response.\n\n### Why\nThere are a fair amount of items and multiple choice items in this task. The instruction has no preface. The user needs to scan the instruction, see which items they can easily find a solution too and then build up from there. In the first instance, there are many items in the instruction, so the user will choose to use the least computation that they can in solving the problem. The least computation of the given items is calculating the number of days it will take to rent a car. \n\nThe question itself doesn\u2019t provide that much direction, but it can be fairly easily solved using the instruction. Some details need to be extracted in order to do the answer. \n\nThe user first decides they want to split the amount 310 and to then use an integer which is the amount after dividing by a multiple.  \n\n310  * 11  /  365(3650)  =    (8.21)   33.04 = 310.\n\nThe amount is 310.  \n\n### Next Instruction:What is the sum of the measures for all 4 sides of an rectangle? Choices: 1:5,8,4,4  2:8,5,4,4  3:11,10,8,8  4:13,12,11,11\n\n### Response\nAnswer:  4 is the appropriate response.  \n\n## What makes 4 a good choice given the choices?\n\nThe user should apply the principle of elimination to this question. The only thing left after all of the other choices have been eliminated is 4.  \n\nWhile 4 the choice is a bit of a stretch, it isn\u2019t entirely unreasonable. All of the other choices make very little sense. One of the choices is the same as before because the user used a calculation.  \n\n## Next Instruction:In a family with two siblings where the older one is a girl and the older brother is a boy, the total combined age of the family is 120 years.

Each time I played a sport I thought that I would end up with some form of a trophy for participating in that sport.  I learned that in football and basketball there is a championship trophy for those championship teams.  A championship team in high school makes a trip to a bowl game in Florida in football or the championships in Phoenix for the high school basketball teams in Arizona. There are also small trophies for winning the football or basketball championship in your conference.  I learned that the first season that you play football or basketball you likely will not win any championships but only if you're very good.  The next season will likely have the same results from the first season but with a little more luck.  Next season may result in winning your conference.\n\n###### Lacrosse resulted in a nice trip to Florida.  Football resulted in a trip to Florida.  Basketball resulted in a trip to Arizona.  A trip to Arizona in basketball was amazing and I learned a lot.  One thing I had a problem with is that my team had a losing record at a certain point.  In my second year of basketball we started to win some games which was a total turn around from our first year.\n\n###### A few months ago I went to a baseball game with friends.  This game was not for any organization.  We were wearing jerseys of the team that we went to root for.  I thought that was odd because I have never attended a baseball game and worn a jersey of a team that I cheered for.

In the first row, all the figures are identical in height and have a blue dot on their cheeks. In the second row, each figure depicts a different animal with its head held high and their front legs held in a raised position. In the third row, the figures are all humans and each figure has their arms outstretched as if to be giving a speech.\n\n### Note:The three pictures show the first row, second row and third row respectively.\n\n### How many porcelain figurines does Annie have?\n\n### Choices:  A. 22 B. 24 C. 26 D. 30 \n\n### Note :This has two ways to solve it.\n\n### 1.Count the number of squares that are in the first row. There are 6. So, the number of figurines that she has = 6\u00d75.\n\nThen, count the squares that are in the second row. There are 8 squares in the second row. So, the number figurines = 8\u00d74 = 32\n\nSo, we now have the required number. We need the total number of figurines = n.\n\n### Thus, answer for 1st way ->n=6^4+8^4 = (136)^4 = 15709.\n\n### But answer for 2nd way is ->n=(6^5+8^4) or 347.\n\n### We have 4.\n\n### It is clear that there are 30 figurines. If the total number of figurine is n, the number of rows should be raised to exponent n-1.

You could also go for a walk after you've eaten because this will help make you feel fuller and so you wont eat too much food as an adult and it's been proven that children and teenagers who go for a walk after eating have less cravings to eat more and so the people who are more active are less likely to over eat and be overweight.\n\n### How would you avoid eating too much during holidays?\n\n### Instutions\n\n### Which of the following might help you avoid making errors when adding?

The goal of skimming is to get a general idea about what the document is about.\n\nTo find something that is in the right column but the word in the left column. So the whole point of skimming is to take what word in a sentence says or means and that is what I think it is about that sentence.\n\n### Input\nHow much will it cost Jessica to ship her package from China? The cost of shipping a package from China is $3.70 per pound of the package weight. The weight of her package was unknown. Choose the answer that correctly explains how much the shipping cost will be for Jessica\u2019s package to her home in the United States\n\n### Possible answer choices\n\n### Answer:\nD\n\n### Discussion:\nIn case of skim is that the way you can read words in a sentence you read a sentence and you can find that that whole sentence is in the left column of the word but the word in the right or the whole word but the word isn't in the right column of the word then you know you have a concept if you have a concept for that so that's why.\n\n### Other details:\nThe word order for skim is like, in the question if a question says like what are you going to do with the word if you go skim it's not going to be the whole meaning of the whole phrase of the question it's only going to be the whole word so it's not like skimming the whole document it's only that word that is in the sentence but not in the context left and that's what we do for skimming it's the whole idea of skimming it's all about those words.\n\n# I got that the word order for skimming is like, the word it is that whole word that is in the context but you can't tell the whole idea of it it's just that those two words or that just", "answer": "B: feel pressure"}

For example, if the human needs 1350 calories per day, dividing 1350 by 8 hours (since an average person eats 3 meals a day) would be 170, which is the total number of calories the person could eat per meal (170 calories \u00f7 8 = 170/8 = 175/8 = 15/2 = 75).\n\nInput: An elephant eats 250 pounds of food per day and lives 50 years.

You pay 17% tax on every dollar of your income. You are going for a trip that is 4 days long. How much will you spend on travel expenses during the trip, in dollars?\n```\n\nFirst of all, you need to identify and write down the operations you need to do. To find for the total wages, we use the following formula:\n$$W[total wages]=1200$$\n$$W\u2019[total wages] = 1200*8+1200*24 +1200*16+1200 *10$$\n$$\\textbf{W}[total wages] = \\color{red}{9600} \\ \\ \\color{red}, \\ \\ \\textbf{W\u2019}[wages] = \\color{#0f0}{16800}$$.\n\nThen to find for the tax on every dollar we use the following formula, where D[tax on every dollar] is the tax for every dollar, which in our case is 17% of every dollar.\n$$T[total tax] = 12*D[tax on every dollay]$$, where $D[17] = 0.17$.\n$$D[17] =\\color{#0f0} {.17},\\color{red} T[total tax] =\\color{red}{216}$$\n\nThen to find the $T\u2019[total tax deducted]$ we take 216 of 9600 from our original wages, which is:\n$$T\u2019[total tax] =(216*9600", "answer": "C: income"}

The cats would squeeze between the cage bars into the small chair.  After the 2 cats had sat in it and tried to fit without success, the cats never again wanted to try to fit into the chair.  The chair was 20 cm wide, which is exactly the same as the small kittens\u2019 combined total width.  But, there was room for the cats to move between and beside the bars.

The question states that there are four cats, not five, in one cage:  4 small kittens and 2 medium-sized cash.  How many more medium-sized cute cats can there be in the cage so that one medium-sized cat can be alone in the chair without any of the small cashes there?  \nThe answer is one: 1 medium-sized cat plus 2 small cashes.", "answer": "E: evil"}

{"text": "C\n#### Input:  Let's begin by calculating the possible total distances from Chicago to the 5 different towns.  The total number of cities that start with the letter B is 45 and the two letter combination between T and R is 26.  Therefore we'll need to calculate how many letters are in the name of each city in B and R.  Here we assume that any name that starts with the letter B has the most \"B\"s in it.  The number of names in B can be calculated by using the formula, N(90)=(45*1!)/3! which equals 36.  Each two letter combination RS, RT, RU, etc. can be calculated with the above formula: N(90-23)=(26*1!) /3! and all of these values can be then added to determine a total of 55 names or possible cities. Next, we'll need to find the total number of towns that start with any letters in B.  In this example, all of the possible combinations of B and R will be listed as follows: B(36)+R(26) which equals a total of 62 names.  Next, the total number of towns in Illinois is 3708, and the total number of words in Illinois is 57.  Therefore the number of words can be calculated as N(57)(96).  One last thing to consider is that only one letter of S, I, T, U, V, R, and N are common across these words.\n#### Conclusion:\nThe final, most straightforward conclusion is that 62-3708 people who begin with any of the letters in B cannot be located in Illinois.\n\n##### Alternate Response:\nIt can be determined that 55 people in Illinois start with all letters or letter combinations in B and R. Because S, I, T u V, and N are common letters in most given words and because there are 3,708 towns in Illinois, we can conclude that only 55 people in all of Illinois start with any of the letters B and R.\n##### Response:\nIt can easily be determined that Chicago is 190 miles from Boston, Boston is only 45 miles from New York, and Philadelphia is nearly 200 miles from Washington, DC.", "answer": "C: disneyland"}

The question specifically noted only people which would exclude animals. And I found most people wouldn\u2019t be likely to go to the cricket stadium regularly. This leaves us with the house and the train station\n\n#### The cupboard is unlikely\n\nFor a cupboard to have the same air that was breathed into it recently, it must have contained breathable air from the start. It cannot have been emptied and filled with air from another location such as a house or train station. Thus a cupboard cannot have the same air breathed into it recently.\n\n#### The house is unlikely\n\nIn most houses we would find an air conditioner, which means the air in each room or building must often change. It would be uncommon for the air in an entire house to stay for quite some time without some significant change. The house would also need to be a very large/old house to store old air the rest of the time. \n\n#### The train station is unlikely\n\nOne option is that the train station could be in use. If so, then people would find and breathe a different air. The train station could have had an event and after there would have been  new air in the station. Alternatively, the train station could be empty and the air breathed in could have been from a long time ago. \n\n### Input\nSix men are wearing hats of four different colors, one of which represents a color already worn by two or more of the others.

In the example with a car rental, we have one car that is priced at $30/day. We know that the time is a duration. For example, if the car rental were only for 1 day, the answer would be 30.\n\n2) Take the total money spent on the product. For the first example, if we had rented a car for a total of 8 days, we would multiply 30 (days we rented) by 8 (total days we were renting for) to come up with $240.\n\n3) Convert days to hours, as you did in the example with the vehicle. So, if we rented the car for 11 hours, we would write 11 hours to the left of the multiply sign as 11 * 24 = 254 hours.\n\n4) Solve the problem.\n\n```\nCar Rental\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nInput: A  rental car costs $30/day with a minimum of 7 days.\nTotal money spent for this rental is $210.\nTotal number of days rented is 12.\n\nSolution: (12 days * $30 dollars/days) = $360\n```\n\n```\nCattle Ranch\n---------------------------------------------------------\nInput: A rancher who is moving cattle can carry 20 head of cows in his", "answer": "C: table setting"}

Write a program solution that appropriately completes each step.\n\n### Step 1: A car rental costs $30/day or $190/week after a week-long period of rental. A car rental agency charges $320 for a day, so the first $30 is charged in the morning and then $320/day after that. Calculate the amount charged per day if a car rent is for a total of 10 days.\n#  $320 (the cost of 1 day is $320), $320 (total cost of all 10 days). Then, 10 days * $320 = $3200 total cost.\n\tDuring this process, remember this: Cost + (Cost)^day = Total cost. So each day\u2019s value increases at the rate of the cost (320) raised to power of the day. You just have to multiply the day\u2019s number by (320). It\u2019s just the PEMDAS from math class, and it\u2019s always true. Remember?\n# If you do it this way, $30 will be charged for the first 10 days. Then $320 after 10 day, then finally $3600 for 3 extra days. So for 13 days total, 320+ 30+320=670 and for 13 days, then 670 X (10/13)=$320\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n### Step: 2\n\n### Explanation:\n\n### Example:\n\n### \n### Step:", "answer": "A: airplane"}

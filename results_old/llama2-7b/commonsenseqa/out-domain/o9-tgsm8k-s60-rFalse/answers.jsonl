You can't have this type of currency flowing around in your economy if it is actually a problem in the economy.\n\nEconomic Instability is the condition where a major proportion of the world's economy is experiencing or is expected to experience a negative economic growth rate.\n\n\n\n##### Summary:\n\nI'll break this down into different sections and I'll discuss each part. First, I'll talk about what economic instability means. Then I'll talk about the causes of it.\n\nThen I'll talk about how we can prevent or cure inflation. And I'll discuss it in a little more depth as well.\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about what inflation is. I'll talk about it in more depth later, but let's just say it's a negative rate in an overall economy of inflation. It's a condition where business, which is negative, is worse, worse than the normal growth rate.\n\nOkay. Let's go over to the second paragraph in the sentence there. And what does it say? It says that economic stability has become an overused term but let's think about what an over used thing really means, like when somebody says that you know, you've heard someone say a word a lot and it's really overused.\n\nIs this actually true? Well, I don't think it's an overused term so it's true. What would it mean if it were true that it was overused? So if everyone is just always talking about it and they're always talking about, how important is economic stability? How are we going to make sure that we have economic stability and so on and so forth, it would just be too much of it for us to be able to cope with and we couldn't handle it.

{"text": "The best choice of container to use when keeping things safe would be a container that does not need to be opened much. A food container would not be a safe container, since it needs to be opened and reopened quite frequently. A refrigerator would be good, because it does not much need to be reopened. You could choose a cargo container, but you would open it whenever deliveries are needed. The container you would need with fewer openings would most likely be a closet, or a garage. Since the answer choices all have different meanings, and different situations you need each case for it would be ideal to have each one of these.\n\n### Input :The largest number I know of is 24. A number x greater than the number 24 is 42 greater than 38. What is the greatest number?\n\n### Response :\nThe first thing you would need to do in this question is to determine the number that is greater than 24 (or whatever number you were given.) To find this, subtract 24 from 42 in order to get your number below 42. When you do this, you get 18. Now you need to add 18 with 38 in order to get your final number. When you do this you get 56. So, the largest number I know of that is greater than 42 is 56.\n\n### The greatest common factor (GCF) of 9x^2 + x and 3xy^2 \u2013 y is,, 2x + x 2 (,) 2x^2 + 0x 2 2x + 0x 4 2x + x\n\n### Response\nThe greatest common factor (GCM) of (9x^2+x)(3xy^2-y)(2x+x)(2x^2+0x)(2x+x) would be 6x^2+18x+16.\n\nThe reason for that choice is because I added the factors that were the numbers to 0, in order to get the greatest common fact, if you added all the numbers but 0, the (9x^2 would be considered 45\n\nWhich brings you to 45x^2+50x+40.

These are logs at their building and what happens when you put logs together, they create a house.\n\nAnother place that is built with this type of material is Jail.\n\nThis is what happens in the jail, they are made in a wooden way, but they are not as fancy, because they are made for people that are behind bars, or going to jail. They also have some stairs, but there are very few places to go inside the jail, because they are made so that not many things happen in the jail.\n\nThe internet cafe is known for its staircase, this is very important because if there was no stairs, things would be more difficult for each one who goes to the internet room.\n\nThe bar, it has more or less the same material as the other places mentioned above, but it is made differently, it is also not as big, and they don't usually build houses either.\n\nInside the building, they also use this material, and in most places, this building is built using wood to save money.\n\nNow to explain why I did not take one of the other options as the correct answer, in every other place where a building is built, they use a lot of wood, but in this case it is very unusual, because they are usually made with other materials such as stones, bricks or cement.\n\n### Input 2: A building is 500 feet high. A man on the topmost floor looks down and sees a man 250 feet above the ground. What distance lies between the two men?\n\n### Response\nIt is very easy to answer because the one that is 500 ft will be closer to the one that is 250 ft. But here's the problem, if you see a 9-foot tall person standing next to a 7-foot-tall person, you will know who will win", "answer": "C: blacksmith's shop"}

{"text": "C,disparagement\n\nIn mathematics, a sum is the addition of two or numbers together. This is the same concept as summing numbers together in a numerical sequence where adding consecutive numbers results in the sum of the two numbers. A sum becomes a sum when a + b = c. In the summation notation, x + y indicates add a (x) and b together (y) and the result, c, is represented through x + y = c. \n\nIn mathematics, the sum symbol is defined by the international standard ISO 80000-2:2009, which defines the symbol as \"x\u2215 y, the result of the binary operation of addition of x and y in two ordered fields, where \"x and y take integral values in domains of the fields, that is, x in the x-domain and y in the y-domain.\"\n\n### Input : Write a statement that will give the sum of all odd numbers in the range from 0 to 99.\n\n### Response :\n\nAnswer : 91. \n\n### Input  : Given two numbers a and b.

There is only one way to solve this equation.\n\n### Response- I can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve this equation. I multiply the first two sides of the equation since there is only one side. The sides I multiply can be called X and Y. The X and Y sides are 90 degrees each because they are the sides of a parallegram. The squares of the X and Y sides are then 81 and 5. 52 =25 and 81 squared = 6881. 25*81=2025. Add 1 to 2025. That equals to 2026, 2026 squared is 414,976. The formula for the length of the diagonal is the square root of (base) squared + (height squared). So I have to take the square root of 414976. I can solve that with a calculator.

{"text": "Option A, B, C, D\n\n### Instructions:How did the Supreme Court interpret the Equal Protection Clause in Marbury v. Madison?.\n\n### Response\nThe Court interprets the Equal Protection clause to mean that states and federal government cannot deny a particular individual a benefit on the basis of their membership in a group, such as a racial or ethic group. The Equal Protection clause only applies to discrimination by the federal government.\n\n### Input\nThe case was called McDonell v. Stanton and was an appeal of a lower court case, Brown v. Board of Education.\n\n### Response What decision did the Court make in this case?.\n\n### Option A:\nThe Court ruled that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection provision of the 14th Amendment. The Court found that segregation was a racial classification that resulted in different treatment of different races. The Court also found that the Constitution requires a substantial government interest before the government may classify individuals into different groups. The Court ruled that segregation was not necessary to serve any legitimate interest of the state in educating children in public schools.\n\n### Option B:\nThe Court ruled McCollum v. Board of Education in favor of McCollum, denying the Board of Education the right to force school children to pray in the schoolroom. The Court found that the Illinois statute which permitted the use of school time and school property for religious instruction violated the establishment and free exercise clauses of the 1st Amendment.\n\n### Question\nWhat 2 important Supreme Court cases decided that unconstitutional racial segregation and inequality are pervasive in the country, thus making a comprehensive decision necessary to protect the rights of all Americans to equality?.\n\n### Two important Supreme Court cases decided:14th Amendmenrt (which incorporated all of the Bill of Rights as well):13th Amendment (which emancipated black men)\n\n### Which amendment to the Constitution was originally included to ensure the freed black slaves were not treated unequally with white citizens?.\n\nOption A:\n\n### Other amendments that specifically protect groups:Equality was not the primary purpose of the am", "answer": "E: protests"}

She felt that everything was going fine and that she had a great life, but she got a surprise when she went to play a very scary video game in the evening.\n\nIn the dark room, Tanya started playing the game. It was a scary game where you take control of a monster and scare people. Tanya got to play as the monster. She went out and found a man on a bench and scared him. Tanya jumped in a bush and peeked out to see if she scared the man enough. Tanya noticed the man had something in his hand. He was holding a cross and holding it close to his chest. That made Tanya very angry. She ran at the man and bit him on the neck. That made Tanya laugh, because she saw the man collapse and die instantly.\n\nTanya laughed with joy and started to do a happy dance. She suddenly realized she had been laughing so hard she forgot she needed to sleep. It was late, and she had nothing to eat. If she didn\u2019t eat now, she wouldn\u2019t have enough energy to wake up the next day.\n\nTanya had a hamburger and walked over to her bed. She felt tired.

The university's security team monitors the data generated by those laptops and alerts students to possible security threats. Another common security measure is the two-factor authentication, which requires the users to provide not only their password but also something they know: like the answers to security questions, or a one-time PIN number.\n\n### Output 2\n\n#### University security:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE user (id INT, pwd VARCHAR(30), email VARCHAR(50));\nINSERT INTO user (id, pwd, email) VALUES (1, \"12345\", \"user1@u.edu\");\nINSERT INTO user (pwd, email) VALUES (\"cat\", \"cat@u.edu\"); //password must be 6+ chars\nINSERT INTO user (email, pwd) VALUES (\"dog\", \"dog@u.edu\"); <---- password incorrect\nSELECT * from student where id=@row_id;\n```\n\n### Output:\n\n```sql=\nSELECT * FROM user where [email]='dog@u.edu' and pwd='dog@gmail.com'\n```", "answer": "E: airport"}

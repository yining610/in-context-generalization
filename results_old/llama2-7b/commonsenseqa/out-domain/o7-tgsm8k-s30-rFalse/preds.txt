Choices:  A: student union B: mall C: department store D: library E: town or city<n><n>### Response:		<n>B<n><n>### Input – A: In a restaurant in a city, a manager needs to serve 262 men and women. There will be 122 men and 140 women; however the ratio of men to women must exceed 3:2. The ratios of men to women and men to women must be correct at 5:4. How many tables are needed to serve the entire establishment and still meet the ratio expectations?<n><n>#### Demonstration: <n>One of the first things you do to organize an operation like this is to see how many seats you have in your tables.  There are 130 seats in the restaurant.  That means that 99% of the seats are occupied.  89% of the seats in the restaurant are occupied by men.  That’s how many percent of the men are in the restaurant.  It will never fill.  When the entire establishment has 122 men to women, the total number of chairs in the restaurant will be used.  Of these, 44 percent will be occupied by women.  When it becomes clear that 140 women will be occupying 44 percent of the seats, the total number of seats will be filled.  77 percent of the seats will be occupied by women, leaving 23 percent of the seats to be occupied by men, which gives you a 77 percent to 23 percent ratio.  44 percent divided by 44 percent equals 23 percent of 100 percent.<n><n>### Input -A: A man needs to drive to the airport and take a plane to his new city.

This step is especially important for difficult problems so we can assess a student's ability to solve a problem in different ways, or use more sophisticated mathematics. After one has performed initial tests, they continue to test the student with higher level assessments.<n><n>### Procedure<n><n>#### Step 1<n>The assessors need to develop more problems using a similar format and instruction as we are shown above. These problems should test the same question. The assessors then need to find solutions or appropriate responses for these different problems.<n><n>#### Step 2<n>The assessors find the same solution using different types of numbers (fractions, negative numbers, decimals and mixed numbers).  In this case, the assessors should be finding the appropriate response that is correct for each of the problems given in Step 1.<n><n>#### Step One Extensions<n>In the example, the assessors should ask the student the same type of questions that we give the solution.  <n><n>#### Step Two Extensions<n>Test the student with another test.

In this task, `Input` consists of a statement and one or more choices (referred to below as `A` through `E`). `A` indicates the correct answer. In each case you need to respond to the statement by selecting the variable name or variable value, or `A`, that makes the statement true and correct.<n><n>For example, "How much, in dollars, does she pay for the rents?," is "how much, in dollars, she pay for the renter." We know that she pays a total of $30, making the statement true.<n><n>There are additional explanations of the types of choices you may find at [Writing complete sentences](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/grammar/punctuation/sentence-construction)<n><n>Each case in `input` involves one or more statements. Each statement may or may not have an `Answer` field; in those cases where there is no `Answer` field, the statements are statements on their own and not direct or indirect comparisons among statements. The first part, then, is to complete a statement by selecting the correct variable name or value. Note that there are no choices to "leave blank"; the field is either present or absent. If not present, you should assume that the first statement is true.<n><n>After completing a statement and each answer field, you should evaluate the statement. This means checking whether or not the statements are true--both by checking if they are equivalent and by checking if they are inconsistent. Note that statements can be false or true, equivalent or inconsistent

Choices:  A: bridge B: in spain C: beach D: field E: street<n><n>### Response:		<n>I agree with you, I believe that the majority of the broken glass was found in the field. This is because it is clear that you're referring to the broken glass that was inside the car. On the other hand, from the story, it is true that the broken glass that was outside of the car was located at the bridge. In addition, the broken glass that was found on the other side of the car was located on the street. On the contrary, the broken glass that belonged to the inside of the car was located in Spain at the beach. I also found the broken glass from inside of the car that was at the restaurant. To be honest, I find this a bit confusing because it doesn't make any sense.<n><n>### Input<n>The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.  The total number of students in the class is 112.  If there is an equal number of boys and girls sitting in each row in the classroom what is the least likely number of students in each row that will be made up solely of girls?<n><n>### Response<n>I agree with you that the most likely number of students in the row that will be comprised solely of girls is 35. This is because I believe that the students in the classroom were equally divided, which means that there were equal numbers of girls and boys in each row. Moreover, I believe that the girls made up a majority of the class, so there are more girls than boys. This means that the most probable number of girls in the classroom is not limited by the number of girls in each row. I also believe that there are less than 35 girls in the classroom because there are less girls than boys.<n>

The width of the street in feet will be 97 feet and the length of the curbing will be 617 feet plus 97: 714 feet rounded down to 710 feet and rounded is less than 200 ft.

Choices:  A: department store B: fraizer fur C: specialty store D: christmas tree E: christmas stocking<n><n>### Response:		<n>During this part we will look for the multiple choice answer that contains no spelling errors and is correct.<n><n>Answer: A<n><n>### Instructions:<n>We will use this answer to build a function. The function should be recursive.  The function accepts numbers as input.  The recursive step should return a number that is greater than the input.  If the input is greater than 100, return the input.  If else if statements might be used to further check that the recursive step meets constraints on the number, but this step is not required.<n><n>### Function Example:<n>```<n>public static int fun(int input) {<n>        if (input >= 100) return input; // this function is designed to not return value if input == 100 then it would be 101 (because the number it is wrapping<n>        return 101;<n>}<n>```<n> <n>### Response: <n>Below is the function that you need to write, it need's to be recursive and accept numbers as input, it should return a number that if greater than 101. If the number returned is less than or equal to 101, it should return the number.   Ex: If the function is called with the number 100 then what should it return?<n><n>### Code:<n>```<n>public  int fun(int input){<n>        if (input == 101) {<n>        return input;<n>} else if (input <= 100) {<n>        return fun(input + 1);<n>        } else {<n>        return fun();<n>        }<n>      }<n>```<n>

You will be on the row to the left of the current row or to the right of the current row. If you are on the row to the right you can't do anything unless it is the row above or row below. When you run a nested loop you will need to check each box and keep counting until you get to the end of the ticket count box. Once you get to the end you keep going. The nested loop and the output box should stay on the row they are on. When you get to a point of error you will need to use a print statement to find out what went wrong.<n>### Tutorial<n>http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-loops-and-loop-control-statements/<n><n>### Hint<n><n>You can use the loop control statements in python. When you get a row that is more than 20 seconds you can keep the program running but it will get stuck there. So when you get this you will need to use the print statement to help you figure out why it is not working right. In the nested loop you will need the nested loop to stop doing its

Choices:  A: arlington B: church property C: out back D: every town E: cemetery<n><n>### Response:		<n>In this problem, we could calculate the cost of the total graveyard land, including the back portion and everything outside of the graveyard property. We would then add the cost of the building of the actual cemetery plot area, such as for graves, headstones and other areas that would be used to bury and mourn the dead. We would then consider what each of  the citizens wanted. With each selection, the number the citizens choose would affect the answer.<n><n>### Input<n>The cost of the land is $30,000 and there are 62 citizens in the town. You’ve built five of the six graves with $5,000, which amounts to $26,000 spent of the $30,050 total spent.  Cost to build 28 of the 36 graves is $11,200, for a total of $37,200 spent out of the total of $30,070 available.<n><n>As you can see, the citizen’s vote had a significant difference as to whether the graves were put next to the cemetery plot area or not. The town decided that they did not want the cemetery any larger. As a result, the money left available increased.<n>### Input:<n>In an ideal world there would always be enough, the same, or perhaps some extras of resources for everyone to use them when they want or need them. This is not, how ever, always true. For instance, in the current world the amount of people in our population is growing and some of those people are much more in need of food and other resources, such as medicines, than others. The amount of resources a country or individual has limits the number of people or how much is made available to each person.<n><n>### Response<n>The best option is to limit how much food there is that is available to distribute over a certain period of time, and then to determine what types of food each person needs and is able to consume.<n><n>## Below is a set of data based on income, age, expenses, and spending habits.<n><n>- [Click to expand](./data/grocery_income_expenses.csv)<n><n>### Input : Grocery income expenses<n><n>> The cost of gasoline is 30 cents less

A fiddle is typically a one and a half-measure stringed instrument.  In my research I found fiddle can be defined as a word used to describe a violin. Fiddle in the sense of a fiddle can mean that someone knows how to play the violin. While tennessee might be home of the world famous tennessee river, the answer is a band practice. Tennessee is not really the place to go look for fiddle the instrument and tennessee is not a word used to describe the act of playing violin. Orchestras might be found in tennessee but if you where looking for the violins it would be more of the players then the whole orchestra. Violins and violin cases are very different things and orchestra has thousands of instruments not just violins and violin cases. While a music store could have violins, violin cases, and fiddlers but it would not have tens of thousands of fiddles. Finally, the only place that could have tens and thousands of fiddles would be band practice this is because the fiddle is used to describe only one instrument and the whole orchestra has tens of thousands of instruments.

A B C, I know from the title that the dog jumped to the window to see a person out in front of the house. A: building B: front C: class D: friend's house E: front door I couldn't choose any of these choices, therefore I went for the least number of people in the world to think of C, I could not choose B, because this is a situation where the word house is used and it takes at least two people to have both a classroom and a window. The house would also not be classified as a house if it has no windows to see out. I also could not choose D because I'd never heard of a school classroom on my property. I've always thought of my house as a window seat, because I have a carport that overlooks my front door. The dog barked and I immediately thought of A and B, but then I realized that I didn't have to choose these two choices. I wasn't sure which was the best one to choose, but I didn't want to choose C because I thought the dog was out of the house. I decided on E and I'm happy with that, although I won't be too sure until I see how much of a difference it makes between me and C.<n><n>### Output:<n>I am using an email to let you know that there is an error in the software on the website.

Choices:  A: airport B: gotham city C: london D: city E: gas stations<n><n>### Response:		If you’re going to guess the letter where red is likely to be you would say it’s probably a location where they use gas a lot in the city.  I know that there’s many telephone booths in cities around the world and the city I have lived most of my life in is Dallas which is where I used to be an officer and there was a place in the city on North Stemmons freeway that was well know for people jumping the median in their cars and a lot of the cars ran out of gas there. We have a lot of people in the city that just drive in Dallas so they fill up once they get here but a lot of the people who don’t live here come down from Oklahoma and they run out of gas before they get home so if you were trying to figure where red is in the world the best answer is the city because people drive through so often.<n><n>### Input a problem<n>The ratio of girls to boys in a high school of 500 students is 1 to 3.

In the first bed she pulled out 55 carrots.  In the second bed she pulled out 101 carrots and in the third bed she pulled out 78 carrots.  She found that 6 carrots weighed one pound.  How many pounds of carrots did Kelly harvest?<n>Answer: 39<n><n>### Input:where do you typically find a trash can in the city? Choices:  A: park B: motel C: corner D: bus stop E: store front<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Reason:The park, corner, and bus stop are areas that people walk by or pass through daily and therefore might have a trash can.  Motels have trash cans, and so do bus stops, in front of all of the stores.  However, the front of the store is not considered an "area in the city."<n><n>### Input:"How do you feel?"<n><n>### Response:"I’m fine."<n><n>### Reasons:<n>#### There are many ways that you can respond to "How do you feel?" but "fine" is one of the most popular responses.  When you respond, "fine," you are indicating that you are happy, healthy, and on the verge of being well.  Fine means that you are not sick or suffering from some illness and is a positive, neutral answer to this question because it shows that you're happy, healthy and well.<n><n>### Input"How’s the school today?"<n><n>### Reponse: "I like it.  It is fun."<n><n>###Reason:"how is school today?" is a short way of saying "how do you feel about school today" in which "how do you feel" is used rather than a more direct question "how do you feel today" and "about school" in this case means about today, not tomorrow or the day after.<n><n>###Input: You are looking for a place to live.  Where will you find an apartment? Choices:  a: outside of the city b: downtown c: on the street corner d: near a park<n><n>###Response:B<n><n>###Reasons:"Downtown" refers to the central business district of a city or town, which is where many business headquarters, banks, courthouses, shops, restaurants, and government buildings are found..There are no apartments or shops on the street corner, so this is not a good choice. "Near a park" means apartment near a park which is not an option. "Outside of the city" is just referring to apartments that are not in the city area.<n><n><n><n>***<n>

Choices:  A: read B: passenger C: land plane D: fly the plane E: buy tickets<n><n>### Response:		What do people do to pass the time before they  can use electronics when flying in airplane?  A and C are incorrect.  Flying the plane is not a possible choice since flying a plane is done by pilots.  Passengers can't do that.  "Flying the plane" is a metaphor used in a song.  Passenger tickets are purchased in advance and are not something people do for passing the time.  Passengers also can't buy a ticket at that time because there is no one selling tickets on a flight.  It is just not possible for them to do "this". Choices B and D are incorrect choices as well.  Reading is not something people can do right away because there are no reading materials at that moment.  You can, however, wait a few minutes for some reading materials before you can read. Passengers also can' wait for their assigned seats.  "Passenger C" does not really make sense because passenger is supposed to sit when flying in an airplane.  So the correct response is "Choice B: Passenger"<n><n>### Instructions:Analyze the two pictures of the train and select the one that describes the first picture.  A:  Train number 1391 is arriving. The destination is Santa Fe. B:  Train number 6 is leaving in the opposite direction with the destination being Albuquerque.  C: Train number 1552 is returning from its destination of Santa Fe. It is arriving at the track in Albuquerque. D: Train number 5381 is departing from the Santa Fe station.  It is going to the Albuquerque station.<n><n>### Response to Analysis:In the picture "D", the sign near the tracks states that the train number 5385 is arriving in Albuquerque Station.  The train is heading to the station because the destination of the train is Albuquerque.   The train is not returning to Santa Fe since it doesn't have the sign at all.  Trains rarely return to the same station.  So in the first picture "Train 1" is departing to the Santa Fe station and the second train number "Train 2" in the second picture "Train 3" is going to Albuquerque station because its sign shows that the destination is Albuquer

Choices:  A: drawer B: back to its owner C: police station D: crime scene E: holster<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. It costs more to rent a car for 12 days than for a week. 75 is greater than 50.<n><n>2. The car rental agency charged $30/day so 7 days at $30/d is $210 + 12 days at $30 = $360.  There is a $15/day charge for each additional day, so 12 days is $180.  So, total paid for 11 days is 210 + 360 + 180 = 750.<n><n>3. A hurricane is on the southern coast of Texas.  The rancher wanted to move his cattle 60 miles inland so $30/d cost = 60 miles $30/m =.5c/m so.5 * 60 miles = 30 miles<n><n>4. Jason rented the house for $50/d, 14 days = $700 + 20 head @ $50/c = 1000.  Eric rented the house for 24 days, so he will pay 800+500 = 1300 for 24 days or $54.17/d <n><n>5. Melissa drives to town twice a month so this is $50/d so yearly is 48 * $50/d = $2400.<n><n>6. Since the ratio of boys to girls is 5:7 there are 9 boys.  Divide 5000 by 9 and get 555.55/boy so each girl gets 51.11. Difference of boys:55*4 = 220<n><n>7. Amount for overnight stays is 25%, so remainder is 100%.  Divide 100 by 6 = 16 16 *75 = $1175.  So 1175-175= 1000<n><n>8. 1440-6 = 1434.  So 5 * 1434 is 717<n>

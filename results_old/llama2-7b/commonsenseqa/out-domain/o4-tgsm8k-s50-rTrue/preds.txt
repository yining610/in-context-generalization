We need to know if the pet shops have enough and stop over-over breeding  because if too many are left there will be less wild snakes and they won’t be able to eat the mice and this will drive our food supply downward so we need to stop the over-breeding and we should also not breed them in captivity either.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

Choices:  A: city B: toronto C: radio station D: roger that E: medieval castle<n><n>### Response:		Choice:   D <n><n>#### Explanation:(D) The antennas on top of Toronto’s towers and radio transmitters, like Toronto’s North Star Transmitter, are used to broadcast radio waves. This can be used for communication throughout the city which allows people to hear music, listen to the news or just talk to one another.<n>#### Rationale:(A) The CN Tower is a concrete structure that rises 1,815 feet from the ground. It is the second-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas and the fifth-tallest in the world.<n>(B) Toronto is the largest city in Canada and has the fifth-largest population in North America. There are many business towers including the First Canadian Place, which measures 728 feet and was the first building in Toronto to have an elevator. Toronto has many towers ranging in size as the skyscrapers and building, but it does not have a radio station.<n>(C) The radio waves allow us to hear music, listen news broadcast, and listen to the stories. The antenna are used to transmit these waves by broadcasting them to the population. Toronto does not have an actual radio station that it owns so people have to find another city (or country) to listen to.<n>(D) The radio transmitters use the antenna to send the radio waves to a receiver that then converts it to sound so we can hear it. The Roger's tower is one of Toronto’s radio stations that uses its antenna, which reaches 1,314 feet.<n>(E) There are not any medieval castles in Toronto. If the castle was in Toronto it would have been built with wooden planks and had a lower level and a stone tower. The castle would have been built near the shoreline to protect the people from any invaders travelling by water.<n><n>#### Link: https://microbitnes.microblink.com/2XhV66R<n>

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

If she works every week of the year she plans to have $200 by the time she is 15. How many weeks does she have until that age? Choices:  a: 20 b: 10 c: 15 d: 22 e: 17<n>### Response: The answer to the above instructions is D (22)<n><n>### Answer Rational: By the time that Jennifer turns 15, she has to have saved at least $200. But if her weekly income is $3, if she saves $50, it would take $3 * 3 weeks * 50 + 50 * 10 + 50 = $1450. So with the amount that she has currently saved, she has 22 weeks until she turns 15, therefore her birthday is in 22 weeks.<n><n>### <n>### Input:The amount you save every week can be written as a formula. What number represents the amount that is saved every week if Amelia is saving for a trip to Disneyland? Choices: 100 200 300 400 500<n>### Response:<n>### Answer Rationale:<n>The formula for Amelia's saving is: 50 + 10 * $3. The answer must be less than 400, so the minimum answer is 4 because 400 is a maximum, and 5 is an integer. Therefore the answer is 4.<n><n>###<n>### Input: <n>### Response<n><n>###<n>

Which equation can model how the money is divided among the teams? <br> $4=2a+6a^2<br> $6a+2a^2=6<br> $4+2a=4a+2<br> $10=5a+6<n>Rationales: The first equation shows that since $4=2a$ then 2 * $2a$ = 4. (2 a x 2) = 4. 2 (a x 2) = _A_ (b x 2). A x D = A x 4. So A = 4. Then, $($4+2a) = 4a + 2$.<n>The second equation is equal to 6, so $6a + 2a^2 = 6 $, $6 + 2a^1 = 6 $, $4a + 2 = 6 $.<n>The third equation is equal to 4, so $4+2a = 4a+2$.<n>The fourth equation is equal to 10,

However, on her third practice test (c), she only missed one problem. She's decided that on her fourth practice test (d) she won't keep track of the ones she gets right and she won't keep doing that after that.  She would like to get perfect scores on each of the other four sections and she only plans to do four more practice tests before the olympiad.

So Doreen has to be more than 5 times 5 = 25, because Kyle is only 11.<n><n>### Input 3: Annie’s age is one-third the sum of the ages of her daughter and her son. If her daughter is 16, and her son is 21, what is Annie’s age?<n><n>Annie’s age has to be, 15, because the difference is 16 + 21 = 37, and 16 is the lowest. So Annie has to be 52.<n><n>### 4th input : After 3 hours, Ben subtracts 6 from 2 times his current age. After another 3 hours, Ben wants to subtract 4 from 8 times his current age. How old is Ben at this point?<n><n>Ben subtracts 6 + 8 = 14 from 2.  So at 5 hours, it subtract 14, which is equal to 7, and at 8 hours he can start counting. So he can start counting at 14.<n><n>He can start counting at 9 because he subtracts 4 from 2.<n>

Choices:  A: chicken coop B: supermarket C: box D: egg carton E: henhouse<n><n>### Response:		<n>Eggs are stored in the supermarket in their own special room away from the actual store. There are several reasons for this, first the eggs may become contaminated if they were stored in a different room. The store can also charge more for egg because they have a safe location. The egg carton is another reason why eggs are sold a special price. <n>The only reason eggs are stored in a carton is for practicality and for easy dispersion. A carton is made for people who only have a few eggs and wants to carry it a convenient distance instead of lugging a whole package home.<n>#### 4<n>Answer: Eggs are stored in their own special room in the supermarket<n>

E: None of the choices are correct.<n><n>### Response<n>The correct answer is B.<n><n>### Solution<n>If you knew the radius of a sphere, you could determine the volume of the sphere. Then, using Pythagorean theorem, you could determine the height of the sphere.<n><n>### Example with two dice:<n>If you have a dice, the volume of the dice is 5.4 x 5.4 x (1/6) as there is 1/6 chance of rolling the die.<n><n>### If you have two dice, the volume of each die is 5.4 cubed, times 5.4, which is 5.4^6.<n><n>### To determine the volume, we add 4.4^6 + 4.5^6 which is 4.4 + 4.5 = 9 cm^3<n><n>### To compare the difference between the height and the radius, use Pythagorean Theory: √(4.4^6)(√4.5^6) = (5)2 which is ≈ 25.6<n><n>### This is less than 7/2, since 4.4^3 is less than four times it's radius, so it is true.<n><n>### This follows because 5.5^6 ≈ 4 and 4.4^4 = 4.20001, which is less than 5.<n><n>### Note the use of a fraction.

A: $.7 B: $375 C: $50 D: $20 E: $-5 C<n><n>### Solution A<n><n>In order to find the difference and the value of the pay day we'd have to find how much money we started with each day.

Write a response that correctly completes the instruction.<n>Input: John paid 25% of the tax on a new boat. He also paid 1.50% interest on a loan to buy the boat. He put down $2200 of his own money and got the rest for a down-payment in the form of a loan. How much money did he have to put down?<n><n>### Instructions<n>1. Multiply the 25% of tax by the price of the boat: (0.25)(13,500)=3875<n>2. Multiply the interest payment by 365 for one year: 90(365)= 32,450<n>3. Add the tax payment and the interest payment to the money saved, and subtract the cash price and down payment:<n>```3875(minus)90(minus)2200=25875-3450-2200=17605```<n><n>### Question:What does $17605 represent?<n>####Answer:The amount of cash John had to put down<n>###Instructions:Tally tally tally!

If he has a discount of 50%, this means that it costs half price to rent the second car for a 4th and 2nd time.  However, his discount does not apply to the first car. If $90 of the total cost is for the second car, then $90-(1/2*$90)= <<$90-(1/8*$90)=$29>>$29 goes for the second car and $25 goes to first car. If the answer is $25 + $29 = <<25+29=54>>55 days, then $55+25= <<55+25=$76>>$76+$75+$

Choices:  A: owner B: foot C: subordinate D: base E: point<n><n>### Response:		The owner, the head, or in this case, the branch is a subset of the entire organization, which would be called the branches' leader. In a branch office or similar set up, there is usually a higher-up branch supervisor who is head of everyone working in that office. This person, in turn, is directed by some higher-up and is responsible for the workers in the head-yeller's branch. The head-yeller is responsible for these, and therefore they work with them, are their superior, and tell them what to do. To tell someone to do something is to direct someone to do that thing. Therefore, this person is directing those under their command. This person could be considered the leader of the branch.<n><n>#### Response Rationale:<n>The head-yeller is directing this person's subordinates/employees.<n>The head-yellers boss/employees leader is then responsible for the head-yeller and all other employees/subordinates<n>The responsibility can then go up the chain of command until the head of the organization is reached (the CEO)<n>#### CEO<n>Answer: C<n><n>Answer: The correct answer is D, points. A point can direct a person to turn left or right.<n><n><n>To do so, they would stand at one intersection (the point) and yell directions at the driver, pointing (directing) with their arm.<n>If the driver is not sure which direction to go, they may ask the person for directions.<n>The driver may inquire as to which way to go, by asking what direction to turn.<n>To do this, the driver would point to where they are going to turn which is known as a point.<n>The point is directly in front of the car and directs the driver to go in a certain direction.<n>In the diagram, the direction that the person is pointing is towards the point where the road forks, which tells the driver to make a left turn.<n>So, a point would be the name for that specific location where it is used to direct a person to decide which way to go.<n><n>#### Point<n>Answer: D<n><n>Answer: The point is directly in front to the car, so they need to point the driver in that direction to decide which way to turn.<n><n>#### Point: Answer A: No<n>Answer B: Yes<n>Answer C: No<n>Answer D:Yes<n>Answer E:

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

If an accident or injury is serious, the victim may bleed so much that it can lead to death.

Choices:  A: interesting B: fun C: joyful or painful D: very important E: free<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I would change the learning process to being more painful when someone doesn't like learning. The main reason why I said that is, that when someone learns painful things then they will do all what it takes to avoid that pain. Therefore they will never learn. For example, if the learning process is fun then the students will probably not learn. On the contrary, if they learn something that brings them pain, then they will always think about learning that to keep themselves out of the pain. Thus, when someone does not like learning, they need to have more pain when learned.

Choices:  A: infect B: reproduce C: mutate D: eat food E: make computer malfunction<n><n>### Response:		I'll give the right answer with the explanations. My answer is D. A virus invades a persons computer system by first infecting and then reproducing itself. When a virus infects a persons computer system, it enters the computer and then changes the computer system to start reproducing more of itself. Once a computer system is infected, the computer system will start to run slowly and other problems may start to occur. Another thing that a virus does is eat up the computers memory or computer hard drive memory. A virus can do all of this by eating the memory of the computer hard drive. A virus first infects by entering the computer, second, it reproduces, third, it multiplies or eats up the computer hard drives memory to replicate or to eat up the hard drive memory to grow, and last, it makes the computer slow or cause computer errors.<n><n>### Input : What are three things that can cause a computer to slow down?1. A virus2. Malware3. Hard drive issues4. Spyware5. Too many applications<n><n>### Response : I'll answer this question and I will explain my answer with the correct answer. A computer gets slow or causes computer errors because of too many applications, memory or hard drive memory has too much data, or many viruses and other problems such as malware and spyware in the computer system. One thing that causes a computer to slow down or have problems is a virus or virus software. I think that a virus causes a computer to slow or have a problem because once a virus gets in a computer it will start eating up the computer memeory or hard drive memory to grow and if many viruses are in one computer then the computer might slow down a little bit but not so much because it has to slow down a little to where its not too slow. Another thing that could cause a computer to slow is having too many applications installed on one computer, and the last thing could be that if the computer hard drive or memory does not have enough space and has too much data such as many pictures and not enough hard drive it will slow a computer system in many different ways such as make it slow as much as it could be slow.<n><n>### [Instruction Answer]: A computer can slow down or cause errors for many different reasons such as the operating system gets slow, and it can happen if there is a hardware issue or the software is not good then it could slow

You add the numbers and then subtract the list of six. Then you multiply the list of six and add them all together. How many numbers do you have left?<n><n>### Response and Rationale:<n><n>In a list of six distinct number, add them all together you will get the answer of thirty four. Then, multiply the numbers of six and add it together to get one hundred eighty six. This will mean that you have sixty-five numbers that will be left out of the list.<n><n>### Rationales<n><n>I understand the first part of the question. You add the six numbers. You add them all together so you will have 34. Here is why I will now multiply it.<n>I would have to multiply the list of six numbers by six so that way when you get to multiply them all together the final answer is 186. Now, I would have to subtract thirty-four from 186 and I get. 152. This is sixteen more then the six that I began with. So you would subtract six from sixteen leaving twelve.<n><n>### Answer<n><n>1: 65<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>Toby says that his grandfather’s age is two more than twice Toby’s age.

I think 'Raise' and 'Entice' should be used in a different circumstance. I selected 'D' for the same reason.<n><n>### Input2:The old barn wasn't beyond repair, just some repairs were needed to fix it so they could use it as they what? Choices:  I didn't like any of these except option E 'they used'.<n><n>### Response2:I just picked 'use' because to me it's the least objectionable of all the other answers. I hate 'use' as a verb, but I was not going to pick the wrong answer option.<n><n><n><n>### Input3:The old barn had been beyond repair and they needed to have a new one built. What was the problem?

I picked 'None' and wrote it as a justification.<n><n>### Question: Which of the following answers is most likely to appear for a given question?<n><n>### Dem: I believe the answer is 'D', because I think they are all good answers but for very different reasons.<n><n>### A: A is probably not correct because I think 'Entice' should always follow 'Raise'.<n><n>### B: B sounds good, but it makes no sense to entice an animal or a person to jump up.<n><n>### C: C is ok, but it sounds a little wordy and doesn't offer up much information.<n><n>### D: D is ok, but this sounds a little more complicated compared to 'use'.<n><n>### E: E is the least objectionable, as suggested by you. But I still think 'use' and 'raised' could be used together as both are actions. And 'entice' could be used to raise an animal.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

However, there is a technique we can employ to help us stay calm and perform at our peak levels on important tests. It is called deep breathing. Deep breathing is a technique that, when used properly, can help lower a test taker's stress levels. Breathing is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. The vagus nerve innervates the diaphragm, the part of the trunk that pushes down to expand the lung capacity. You can see the vagus nerve in your body by looking at it through the skin that is at the base of your neck, down the sides of your esophagus, through your belly button, and down to your pelvis. Deep breathing sends calming signals directly to your brain through your vagus nerve. When you take a deep deep breath it brings your chest farther down than your resting heart rate, triggering your parasympathetic nervous system, which has a balancing, calming effect on your body. When you calm down, your ability to think and reason improves.<n><n>### Suggestion:<n>To try this deep breathing technique, find yourself a place to sit. Sit on a comfy chair, or have a blanket near your face, and place your hands on your lap so that you can breathe deeply with your fingers on your lap. Start with your right hand on your lap. Place your left hand on your knee, palm facing downward. Begin to take deep breaths, inhaling through your nose with your mouth closed. Imagine that your left hand is lifting your right palm upward as you inhale. Exhale. Repeat.<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Where can you store a small notepad on your person?

The elephant is 18 feet tall and 15 feet long in order to comfortably live inside the structure.  If you are given 90,000 bricks per cubic foot to build the enclosure, how long can it be?<n><n>### Rationales<n>The exercise room is 50'x50' so its height and width are both 50 feet. Now the covered area for shade and safety is 20 feet squared so that means the length of the covered area is 20 x 20 = <<20*20=400>>400<n>We could multiply the area by the height to find the volume, so we would do 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80<n>we found the volume which is 1200 so you multiply that by 6.5 to find how tall we would have to make the enclosure for it to be 18 feet in height. 1200 x 0.65 = <<1200*0.65=780>>780<n>We found out that it would be 78

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

Choices:  A: backpack B: closet C: drawer D: dinner E: cupboard<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is Utensils are used during dinner.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>The correct answer is Utinsels are used during dinner. I believe this was the easiest question so far, just because it seems pretty straight forward. I don't really have any tips for this question, just that you should read it carefully and double check all your options. <n><n>### Input Two choices, each followed by a possible response:<n><n>A) After reading a math lesson, the student may ask the teacher a question. B) After reading the book, the student can complete a comprehension activity. C) After reading a book, the teacher should make observations about the students reading speed. D) After reading a book a student should complete the book report.<n><n>### Response <n>The correct answer is After reading the book,the student can complete a comphrengion activity.<n><n>### Reasoning <n>After reading a book the student may ask the student may ask they teacher a question but they can never complete a comprehension activity,because that is what comes after the student reading the book. There may be a few other options that may match the question but this is what i got. I think this was the easiest question, just because you had four options. For this question, just do multiple choice to make sure that you are not mixing up your question words. So it is probably better to do multiple choice because then you can focus more on making sure that you have the correct answer. And then also make sure that you double check because you don't want to make any type of careless mistake <n><n><n><n><n><n>

Make sure to describe these ideas with your comments.<n>    - Doing this will allow you to provide your answer and use your own knowledge to form a conclusion. <n>- **Informal**: don’t worry if your explanation does not end up being formal English. CAT uses the context of the question, if you are using the right vocabulary and describing concepts accurately, you will get credit for it. <n><n>

Choices:  A: ghost town B: third world country C: human body D: rug E: hospital<n><n>### Response:		C (Disease is often spread, but you shouldn't be getting sick at home)<n><n>### Rationale:<n>It is spread in disease often, but shouldn't be in ghost town, because it is not a place for humans. In human body, it might be spread, but it doesn't need to spread there because you cannot cure yourself. If you go to rug, you might be spreading disease, but it doesn'a matter because you cannot cure what you spread. Rug, ghost town, and human body are all places for animals, but not for humans, so A is wrong. B is also wrong, because third world countries are places where some people are rich and others are the opposite, and this is not where you should be spreading disease. D is wrong because even if you don't die, it will still get onto the rug where it cannot be taken.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

If Richard is 14 years older and Hurley is 18 years younger, what are they combined ages?<n><n>### Reason:<n>It is explained that Richard and Hurley are twenty years younger than their combined ages 41 years from now. Richard is 24. They also said that he is 20 years younger, so then he is 4 years older than 20 because Hurley is 12 years younger than him since he is 24. Hurley will be 8 years old when they get together. Hurley is said to be 18 years younger than them, which will make him 18+20+18=56 in 41 years. They are 20 years older than 41 years ago.<n><n><n><n>### Initial Reaction:<n><n>I thought that the original problem is asking you to find the difference of the two of them ages. I was unsure of this because there is an extra number in the questions saying there will be 20 year difference in age 40 years in the future.<n>The question says that Hurley is 13 years older than 14 since he is old 14.<n>I am confused about whether Hurley is 4 years older or 54 years older than them.<n>I have a lot of confusion in this question.<n><n>## 𝑻𝒉𝒂𝒓𝒚(𝑁𝒂💋𝑖𝒕𝒂𞒔𝒐𝒏 𝒐😌𝑔𝒆𝒓💄 𝑖🫀𝒂𓿻𝒂 𝒂𛏅𝑐𝒎

She agreed but gave him a chore to do first.  If James needs to complete 5 chores in order to go outside, what are the smallest total amount of chores that they can complete?<n><n>### Rationale: James must complete 5 if he wants to go outside. So, 5/1 in a unit fraction is 5/1 which is 5.<n><n>### The sum of the fractions is equal to 5. Because to find the smallest sum, we have to choose an integer in the answer. So the smallest sum is equal to 5 for 5/1.<n><n>### Answer: 5/1<n><n>### Instruct: James can only have 1 cup of milk at lunch. His choice is bananas or sandbox for the fourth day. Sandbox means he has to clean the classroom for an hour. James loves bananas and despises cleaning so he wants to make sure he has enough bananas to not clean the classroom. There are 24 bananas in a box. James has only two boxes of bananas and only 0 in his stomach. How  many must he eat if he doesn't want to clean the classroom?<n><n>### What is the Rationale? We are looking for the lowest value of the whole fractions because that will give us the amount or pieces that James has to eat to find the lowest sum for each box.<n><n>### There are 24 total pieces for each box since there are 2 boxes of bananas.<n>We can divide 24 by 2 if we have 2 boxes of banana.<n>24/2 = 12 bananas in each box.<n><n>12 is the bottom number in the fraction.<n><n>### We want the lowest value of whole fractions, which is half of 12 which is 6.<n><n>### So he only has to eat 6 bananas to not have to clean the classroom.<n><n>### What does 5/1 do if is the lowest value?<n><n>### We have 24

Choices:  A: costly B: captive C: contained D: paying E: caught<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### 5<n>Answer: <n><n>### Input&Response<n><n>Input: The total value of all items in the store is $2000. The boss sets the total amount of money needed to be $1500.  The remaining money would go to the state because of taxes. Then the boss divided the money equally among the employees, which is $35 profit for each employee. Each employee receives a commission of 50 cents per item.  The owner made a mistake in how much he needs to pay the employees. How much would the employees be paid?<n>Rationales:(1)  Total value of all items is 2000<n>(2) Boss set 1500 as total amount needed to pay = 2000 - 1500 = 500<n>(3) The employees get 50 cents commission on each item<n>(4) Employees get $35 profit which = 35*6 = <<35*6=210>>210<n>So ($2000/6) - $210 = << (2000/(6))-(210)=378.33>>378.34<n>#### 378.38<n>Answer: 378.40<n><n>### Question:<n><n>What do you think about the task? Do you think this is a fair description of the task? What do you think would make this task successful?<n><n>#### Solution:<n><n>1-1. It is a good job that the task starts from the general question and then narrows down to a particular problem. I think that the question is asking us the following question: if you gave each student a dollar how would you distribute the money. The question is very specific and it is easy to understand.<n><n>1-2. It is a fair description of a task.<n><n>1-3. One way would be by dividing 6 people by 2 and getting 3 dollars each, then divided 2 by 2 to get 1 dollar. After doing that the 3 people left with 3 dollars will do the division of 5 by 3 to get all to have 1 dollar.<n><n>---<n><n><n>### Solution for Question:<n>The question is asking the total number

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Bob thought that his Pokemon cards were common and worthless, but he was wrong about them.

Choices are:  they are both even number even number 2s that are 2 <n><n>#### 999<n>Answer: The number 64 is even and it has 8 2s in it<n>So the number 2^4 is 16, which is also even and the number 16 has 4 2s in it.<n><n>### Input If 235 x 58 = 13476 and 13477 = 13,476 what is the greatest common factor of 235 and 134 / 7?<n><n>#### 251<n>Answer: None of these<n><n>### Input Can you explain your reasoning in solving Exercise 9?<n><n>#### 130<n>Answer: The number is 2 so it multiplied out the way it should because 2 × 2 × 2 = 2³<n>When we multiply the number 2³ it equals 8 (2 +2+2)<n><n>### Input Does the method shown for Exercise 10 work for negative numbers? For rational numbers?<n><n>#### 0_1<n>Answer: The method doesnt work for rational numbers because negative numbers are rational numbers too so it keeps changing to the negative of the number, for example if we add 10 to the number 2 it would change it to-20 instead of-10<n><n>## Input: When dividing a number by a one digit number (a single digit number), the remainder, if any, is the number formed by the rest of the division.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:I'm at a restaurant ans want a glass of milk, how do I find out if they serve that? Choices:  A: accompaniment to meal B: waitress C: cafeteria D: home E: menu<n><n>### Response:		<n>Restaurants usually do not serve home milk but it depends on the type of restaurant and the state.  The home foods tend to be a fast food place. Dairy stores are more likely to serve home milk. I will ask the waitress if they stock home milk to make sure.<n><n>### Input The supermarket sells challah for $5 per loaf.  How much does one loaf of challah cost in general?  Choices: A: $0.50 B: $0.40 C: $0.25 D: $2.5<n><n>### Response<n><n>As you see, I had to work backwards and multiply the amount the challah costs by the amount per loaf and then divide that amount by 10 to get the amount an average loaf would cost. That method could be considered a shortcut to getting the answer.<n><n>### Conclusion:<n>There isn't one right way to get the desired answer and I think there are 2 ways that are considered correct ways to get the answer.  These two ways are (1) subtracting and multiplying in reverse as I did the first example.  (2) Use division for the first example in reverse.  I think it depends on what you learn easier as to what you'll pick or maybe if you had to do this more often or less often.<n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

That there are some people that are just more advanced than others, whether it be in math or english.  It's not always possible to do work the whole class can't do. <n>2. You may need to step back and explain yourself more to people.  A lot of times kids like to make fun of the way I talk and ask me how I speak.  Once I let them know that I am just from another place, I can understand their jokes better.  They can make fun of the way things are said in our class.

I am a very hard worker and will stay here until I get the help.<n><n>### How do you think the quality of feedback varies by the learning need?<n>Sometimes feedback from the people I have tried to work with doesn't help much.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Where is a telephone booth likely to be red?

What is the total number of fouls that were committed?<n>Rationales.<n>First you find out how many times a player on each team committed a foul by multiplying the total number of foulls by 2.<n>1. So the first total number of foull is 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>1<n>2. So the second total number of foull by multiplying by 2 is 8-5 = <<8-5=3>>3<n>3. So to find the total number of foulies commited you simply do 1+3. <<1+3=4>>4<n>#### 4<n>Answer: 4<n><n>Input: There are 5 men: A, B, C, D and E. There are 3 times as many men as women. The number of women in the group equals 2 plus the number of men who's names begin with the letter 'D'. Find the number of men who have names that begin with the letter 'S'.<n>Rationales.

As far as my birthday goes I have nothing exciting that happens on this day, the only exception is that this year 2020 my birthday was affected. I was planning on getting a bunch of friends over to celebrate it like I normally do but in this case I couldn’t do that since I was in quarantine with my two best friends. With these limitations and restrictions we came up with another way to celebrate my favorite holiday. Since we were stuck inside we decided to do a “Bingo” type of game with cards full of candy and snacks from the kitchen as prizes. It was a fun time spent with my best friends and I still would have done it any other year in lockdown.<n><n>### Solution:Solution to #20<n><n>Let x be the month that your friend wishes to know.

Marlowe is 4 years old, what is their combined age next year? They have birthdays on the same day.<n>### Response: Last year, their combined age was 27.  To find their age in 2 years, subtract their combined age last year by 2 then add 1.  We know their age combined last year is 27, and today Marlowe is 3 less years than Richard is.  So their age combined is    (x + y) = ____ or   27= (x + y),  where "x" is Richard and "y" is Marlowe's combined age, and  27= (x+y), where x= Richard's age and y= Marlowe's age, and we find 27 = (x+y) = 27 = (___  +_ _)  =   ___ and 27= (x-1) + ____, so 27= (___ +27, then ___=27. We know that next year will be 1 year later, so  27 + 27 = 54 = (___+___), so our combined age next year is x+y= 54. We know that last year's age was 27, so <n>last year's age =____-, and this was calculated in the first part of our equation. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation to read x+y= 27 + 25 or 54<n><n>54= 27 +25 <n><n>#### 54<n>Answer: 54<n><n>### Input The difference in ages between Timothy and Owen is 12.

Committing suicide is a type of unsuccessful suicide, and not a type of successful suicide because being successful means finishing the task.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>### Choice:  C: sorrow<n>The choice A: scars is more likely than C: sorrow because after attempting suicide, the people will suffer pain and feel very sad for the rest of their life.<n><n>### Choices:  D: misery and E: kill yourself are not true because committing suicide will have no misery, and it will not keep you alive, and after committing suicide, you will no longer exist so you can no longer do a second attempt.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>In order to kill yourself, you might first have to try to commit suicide.<n><n>### Example:<n><n>```golang<n>func main() {<n>    success := suicide()<n>    if success {<n>        fmt.Println("You're alive")<n>    } else {<n>        fmt.Fatal("You failed to kill yourself")<n>    }<n>}<n>```<n>And what happens if the attempted suicide doesn't work? It prints to stdout `"You failed to kill yourself"`. <n><n>### A: scars<n>The choice A:scars is more likely because of the fact that after attempting suicide, people will suffer pain and never be able to forget about it for the rest of their lives.<n><n>### Successful suicide means committng suicide successfully, and "killing yourself" is not a task. <n>So the other choices are not successful suicides. <n><n>### If you successfully commit suicide, you will die, otherwise you are still alive. <n>So the choice that leads you to die is more likely.<n><n>### You can't get scars after successful suicide.<n><n>######B: being born<n><n>### Response <n>B<n>The answer B is more likely than C because when people choose suicide, they are likely to

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Where can you find pamphlets regarding diseases and ailments? Choices:  A: theaters B: health department C: library D: drawer E: mail box<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Rationales:Theaters can have pamphlets regarding diseased and ailments if you look hard enough.

Also, I know that Choice(E) contains the word "basement" which means the structure is underground, implying that he's in his parents' house, not in his own place. Finally, the first choice has a noun (garage) which implies the object is in his parent's house while the second choice uses a preposition (on) which implies that the object is not in his parent's garage, but rather on his parent's garages, possibly outside. The third choice has the word "living room", a stereotypical room for a child, and "bed" which could mean that he's on or in something small like a child bed. Finally, "guest room" means he is sleeping in a relative's house, which isn't related to the question. <n><n>Answer is:E<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Write a response that explains why the other answer choices are incorrect.<n><n>Answer is:<n><n>Dark green means it is correct<n>

It needs a safe place, so the answer is A. A bald eagle needs a pine tree for shelter.<n><n>### Rationales: A bald eagle is dangerous in open country and at sky because if it is in an open country, other animals may attack it as a food source.

They walk 68 - 35 = <<68-35=33>>33 km, and thus begin to walk. The ferry takes them 8km to the destination. They start walking from where they stopped canoeing and continue to walk.

How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

One child takes 4 beans while the second child takes 6 beans. What did the third child receive?<n>### Input 2: There are 8 pennies, 10 nickels,and 12 dimes. If they are placed in an envelope so they are evenly distributed, how many ways can they be distributed evenly? (Use 0-index notation to separate counting techniques)<n>### Response 1: The third child receives 28 jellybeans.<n>### Response 2: There are no possible ways to evenly distribute a sum of money that have an uneven number of coins, regardless of how many coins in the sum. If counting starts at 1, we have 8 ways to distribute 8 pennies (since there’s 8 distinct ways to choose 8 from 8). We have 10 ways to distribute 10 nickels (since there’s only one way to choose 10 from 10, and 10-3 ways to choose 10-3 from 10). We only have 12 ways to distribute 20 dimes (since there’s no way to choose 12 dimes from 20). Therefore there are no possible ways to distribute the sum.<n><n>### Review 1: Input: A group of 4 children are sharing an apples equally. One child takes the first apple, another takes the 2nd, other takes the 3rd, and then the other takes the leftover apple. If there are a total of 11 apples, how many apples each child has left?<n>### Review 2: Input: If you split an apple into quarters, what is the largest volume of juice that each quarter will have?<n>### Review Final: One quarter of an apple will have 1/4th of the total apple juice, so half the juice. That means 11 apples have 4 apples. Since there are 11 apples and 4 juice quarters left, each child has 3 juice quarters.

If not, then why would they be asking where the cat is likely to be happiest, not least happily alive. The cat’s home is his lap, so it’s natural to assume the cat thinks of his lap as a home. The alley is likely best avoided, because alien cats aren’t always so sociable. The tabby cat is probably used to spending a lot of time on his lap, so a barn would be pretty alien.

When stress wants to go buy food it may stop into any one of the markets, but we can’t specify which particular market. So, the response that is most true is Stress because food.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:A shop will give you what for your purchases? Choices:  A: downtown area B: container C: ocean floor D: the lost city of atlantis E: high school<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is B. <n>The correct answer is B.<n><n>### Input<n>Their son, Troy, is in need of $200 for a school trip. Troy’s parents and he decide to split the cost between each other. The money for Troy’s trip is evenly split between each of the two and they each pay 200/2 = $<<20/2=100>>100 each.<n>However, Troy’s parents decided that they each would like to contribute an additional $50 because they want to fully support Troy. So, they each contribute an additional $5 = $<<5*2=10>>120 in total. The money now comes to $100 + 120 = <<100+120=220>>220.<n>Troy’s parents paid $200 to contribute the $200, but they are still going to need to contribute something to meet the increased cost. This is because they have spent $100, leaving $120 left to contribute. $120 / 2 = $<<125/2=62.5>>62.5 each. So, they need to contribute another $31.25 to cover all the costs.<n>This makes the contribution for each parent another $100.25 + $31.21 = $<<100.2+31.25=131.45>>131.40 each.<n>This equals $100 + $3 = <<100+$3=103>>103. Troy still needs to contribute $20 for his contribution to the trip.<n>Forty percent of the amount Troy contributed will be his contribution, or $103 / 40.5 = $<<103/40.5=2.5>>2.5<n>The final total is $103 - $2.5 = <<103-2.5=100.5>>100.5, which is equal to $100.00 + $2.5 = $<<$1000.5>>$100.0<n>#### 100.5<n>Answer: 1<n>

Choices:  A: matchwinning B: cash in C: compete D: return E: celebrate<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is D. Winning does not always mean having fun. Some people have a natural talent for winning. When it's almost inevitable, winning becomes a stressful situation.

When a gambler wins a lot and feels like they can do whatever they want - like bet on the same hand and go off on an adventure - this person is going to feel an instant urge to leave. This is because the gambler is already exhausted by trying hard enough to make enough wins or just trying too much.<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>### I'm feeling better today.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

Choices:  A: india B: hole C: cage D: habitat E: rain forest<n><n>### Response:		<n>* *A*<n><n>### Reason:<n>This one is tricky I found. If you look at the last question about the car, the last question was about the cost with 6 friends.<n><n>![gif](images/car-wash.gif)<n><n>And for this car-wash, the friends decided to take 60% of the cost.<n><n>![gif2](images/gif2.gif)<n><n>Now,<n><n>![gif3](images/img7.gif)<n><n>So we have $600, $580, $22, $17.5 and $15 each of us.<n><n>### Final Explanation For The Last One:<n>Now from these questions, we are looking at total cost. We are trying to find total cost. For example, car-wash question is calculating the total cost,<n><n>Input | output |  Explanation<n>--- | --- | ---<n>**Cars** |  $1700 |  Cars is cost, which we try to find total cost<n>**Car wash** |  $500 |  Car wash is a total cost we try to find<n>**$90** |  $120 |  $90 is a cost, we are looking at how much we have to contribute<n>**Brad** |  **$40** |  We have to split $40 because $80 is remaining,  $60 is cost, and $20 is for Brad, so we have to split $41/4 = $10.75, and since 10.75% is 40, so Brad has to give $40. We have to split $80 by 5 people. So if I was one of the five people, I will give my 40/5 = 8%, and the rest of 8% is gone from Brad.<n><n>### Explanation For The Lemur Question:<n>First, we have to find total cost.<n><n>We know that India has 2994 native lemmas, and other places is around 16,000. So according to one of the questions, if people like in America and the rest of the world, we have 2,100 native lemmas, in contrast with 299

Choices:  A: idaho B: casserole C: new hampshire D: root cellar E: ireland<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is Choice E, Ireland.<n><n>### Rationale:In the first two paragraphs you will learn about Idaho, New Hampshire, and Casserole. Casserole is the state of New Hampshire, which you just learned in the first paragraph, therefore you do not need to answer this question. Casserole is also a casserole, a delicious side dish, therefore you do not want to guess and accidentally put down B as the country responsible for the production of potato, you don't want to upset your favorite mom with the delicious casserole. I know I would be upset. So for the second paragraph you learn about New England where there's a lot of casserole. Then in the third paragraph you learn that Casserole had a strong potato industry, but now it is mostly known for potato salad, which is not very important to Idaho. Casserole is most definitely not the country that produced potato due to the first paragraph talking about potato, where you learn New Hampshire was not the country. I guess I'm the Casserole. In the fourth paragraph the only important thing to know is that Idaho is the biggest potato producer. I'm sure that Idaho had a lot of cassereoles when their potato industry was booming, which has a nice ring to it, Idaho Casserole. In conclusion, the country E is Ireland, where potatoes originated from and are one of the staple foods of the island.<n><n>#### 4<n>Answer: Ireland<n><n>### Input:-4^3 =512<n><n>### Response:-4^3 = -1250796<n><n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Rationales:<n><n>-4*4*4 = -125<n><n>#### 4*8=8<n><n>4^3 = 42<n><n>-125 = -42<n><n>-4^3 = -222<n><n>#### -4*4*4= -125<n>-222<n><n>### -125<n>Answer: 222<n><n>Input:<n><n>-4^5 = -3125<n><n>Answer: 6,511<n><n>###

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20. If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:The animals weren't good at swimming, so it was hard for them to do what? Choices:  A: pass water B: bathe C: listen to each other D: feel pleasure E: reproduce asexually<n><n>### Response:		A. Pass water<n><n>### Rationale::If you were to describe animals, you might say that they live lives that are good for their environments - they eat what they have to in order for the ecosystem not to become out of balance. Some animals can't swim and so they drown, unless they are able to come up to the surface. Others might not eat much since they don't have teeth. Differentiated instructions: "You could have said 'bath.'"<n><n>#### <n>Answer: A. Pass water<n><n>Input: The children want to bake brownies. Each spoonful of brown sugar takes one teaspoon from the bowl of brown sugar. How many spoonfuls of brown sugar can the three children take if there are one-half cup of brown sugar in the bowl?<n>Rationales::Use half = <<.5=1/2>>1/2 to reduce from 1/2 down to 1/2 for later ratios.<n>The one cup has one-half as much as it originally had. The children can each take 1/2 so 1 - 1/2 = << 1-1/2=1/2>> 1/2<n><n>Let c + b + t = <<c+b+t=1>>1 The 1/2 in this expression is the first one-half,<n>The b, c, and t is the reduced amount you get by subtracting the half-cup.<n>There is the b, c, and d that the kids can eat once b and c are subtracted from the 1 cup the way d was<n>1/2 + 1/2 + 3/4 = <<1/2+1/2+3/4=3/2>> 3/2<n>b /3 + c/4 + t/3+2/6+4/12 = <<b/3+c/4+t/3+2/3+4/12=1/2+1=3/2>>  3/2<n>b =<<b=2>> 2<n>c =<<c=2>> 2,<n>t = t –<t-2> = 3<n>Now c = 2 and b = 2, the remainder is equal to the entire 1 cup – they divide it evenly<n>

Choices:  A: apartment B: pantry C: table D: living room E: shelf<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>**Response:** Choice A: apartment<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The word "place" means you are going to some sort of container. A "pantry" is "some sort of" container, and so is a "living room" or "shelf". However, none of the above refers specifically to dishes so option D refers to a house rather than an apartment.

That is exactly what the 4th person has to do, giving.25 to the 3rd, and the 3rd giving.25 to 2nd, and 2nd taking the remaining $5. Since each person paid exactly, there is no way that the one with the lowest price is not the one who won.<n><n>### Correct:<n>Since you want to play the game, you can pay $11.25.<n><n>### The correct one is (D), because the only way to satisfy all the equations is if (D) is true.<n><n>##

Choices:  A: complications B: tiredness C: anger D: trial E: court case<n><n>### Response:		<n>When i was looking at this question, I thought of each of these possible answers. However, I decided to choose “a” which is “complications”. The reason I picked that out of the options below because the question is asking what feeling can cause one to establish civil action. So the thing that compelled the other choices of feeling is the person is sick and tired of the complication they are experiencing and want to terminate the problem. However, to institute civil action one can not just have the problem they need to have a problem they want to resolve. As well as there needs to be a cause of action meaning that there needs to a legal action that is to be taken in regards to settling issues with a particular dispute. So, a cause of action is more a legal term so that is why I do not feel that was what the option “e” referred to is.<n><n>### Justification:<n><n>The reason I chose “a” are the following sentences. A. “The lawsuit was instigated based in large part because of complication in the sale of the land. the family wanted a specific section to remain but the real estate agent refused to meet their demands” I think it is clear that “complications” is what is important to focus on because a cause of action isn’t the major cause to instituting civil actions. <n><n>### Instant:<n>What feeling might propel a person, in her work, to start a civil suit?<n><n>### Demstration:<n>So, to start it off the woman has issues with a job so they want to institute a civil lawsuit. So this question is not exactly describing the legal aspect of how you can start a civil lawsuit. Instead it is more of the emotional motivator. So I see that a choice is “b” which says “tiredness” but really the feeling isn’t what we are talking about the cause is. So I decided to change the answer to be “a” because the choice is talking more about the feelings involved and motivations that occur in regards to why “a” would like to initiate a civil lawsuit against the land developer. Because in this situation she is trying to resolve issues more rather than just establish civil suit.<n><n>### Answer:<n>In this case, “a” which means “complications” but really the motivation is why she wanted to start the civil action is because the land that

Choices:  A: sailing vessel B: paddleboat C: ship D: motorboat E: tugboat<n><n>### Response:		The answer is E: tugboats have the helm that moves the mast, not sailing vessels, paddleboats, ships, or motorboats.<n><n># Solution 1<n><n>### Rationale<n>The input in the task is "The helm" which is not something you would wear on your head. Instead, the "helm" is something that moves masts.<n><n>Since we do not know what kind of boat this belongs on, our intuition may lead us to pick D: motorboat. The helm moves the masts, which would make sense on a motorboat. But if we look at the answer choices, we know that it does not move the masts of a ship (that is B), a sailing boat(that is A), or a paddle boat(that is a C). Additionally, as the answer, picking E: tugboating is the correct answer for two reasons:<n><n>1. Tugboats are in the answer choices.<n>2. "The helm" is not what you would wear on your own head, but instead what moves the masts of a boat. It therefore does make sense that it would be on a tugboat which would need the steering mechanism(the helm).<n><n># Solution 2<n>**Instruction**<n>Input: The helm is not something that you wear on your head; rather, it moves the mast on what?<n>  <n>Choice (A) A: sailing vessel<n>Choice (B) B: paddle boat<n>Choice (C) C: ship<n>Choice (D) D: motor boat<n>Choice (E) E: tug boat<n><n># **Rather, it moves the  mast on  what**<n>We need to find where the helm moves the mast.<n>Since it is on the mast and the answer choice is "The helm moves the mats on what?", we can determine the answer to be E (tug boat)<n><n># **Solution 1 (More In Depth):**<n>```powershell<n>$input = "The helm is not "<n>$input2 = "something you "<n>$input3 = "wear on your head."<n>$Input4 = "Rather, it moves "<n>$Input4 = $Input4 + "the masts "<n>$Input4 += "on what?"

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car.

Where was most of the the broken glass found? Choices:  A: bridge B: in spain C: beach D: field E: street<n><n>### Response:		 None of the answers are incorrect. That means, since the window of the Honda is broken, the damage occurred from the inside. Since there is no reference to a car crashing, it logically means that the damage occurred while it was still in motion, so  A. bridge or B. in spain are the most likely two. However, if something had happened in Spain and the Honda landed in a field, then we know that the field is not too far away and therefore the best answer is D. field. To explain this reasoning, if we knew that a car crashed into a field after traveling from Spain, then that could only mean that the field must be very close. Therefore a field should be a reasonable explanation.<n><n>### Input(IMPORTANT): <n>The car that was involved in this accident, Honda,  was driven by a student.<n>The student is now driving around campus.<n>The driver of the Honda does not have any cars in his garage at this time.<n>The student is responsible for all gasoline expenditures.<n>The Honda does not have a license plate on it at this time.<n><n>### Response (VERY IMPORTANT):<n>The car that was struck was the Honda that was driven by a student, so the accident must have recently occurred. This gives the Honda limited choices available.  As mentioned above, this accident is more than likely related to another accident, so let's find the car that was involved, and look for a license plate on it. However, there aren't any clues present as to the actual accident that occurred, so we will assume the only damage was the window being broken. If we find the car that was struck, and we know it does not have a license  plate on it, then it's impossible for it to have been struck from the outside of the car while still moving. Therefore, all of the remaining clues refer to a car that is moving, so we will find the car with the broken window.<n><n>Here is where the story begins: If we find the car with the smashed window, and we do not find a plate with 4 letters on it on the car then there is a  possibility that the car is still broken at this time. If it is still broken, then it is broken in the garage, and we know it has to be owned by the student at this time.

You see it’s price is $12,000.  At this time, car’s value is worth $8,000 and the rate of depreciation is 0.65 dollars per year.<n>How long would it take for the car to be worth only $2.000?<n><n>### Rationales: When we buy a car, we pay it's original worth at first. The cost of the cars is $12, and that's the initial worth, we call it as its value, we also have to calculate how much it will decrease for the first year, as we buy a car that means the cost decrease by depreciation, so the rate of depreciatioin is 0.6, so 12-0.6=11.4, and the initial value is 11.4, so the 1st year of depreciation is -1.4 and from 1 - 0.65 = 0.35<n><n>the 2nd year of depreciation 12-0+0.65=11.8 and from1 - 0.35= 0.75<n>the 3th year of depreciation = 12-0 +0.1 = 12 so we take the final value.<n>So we subtract the initial value from its final value,<n>0.2 - 12 = -11.8<n>and after 3 years it will be worth 12.200, as the rate of depreciations is 0.6 or -0.1 per year.

If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:If I wanted to store dirt in my home, where could I put it? Choices:  A: fingernails B: garden C: corner D: computer E: closet<n><n>### Response:		Choose C<n><n>### Rationales: The options are not correct because option A (fingernails) does not need dirt to use, option B (garden) requires soil, and option D (computer) may need a hard drive but does not need dirt. Only option C (closet) answers the question.<n><n>Input:  A man traveling at 6000 mph is at a baseball game and a man at a nearby baseball game traveling at 3400 mph is not looking where the man is traveling because he is too busy thinking that the pitcher will throw a curve ball.  If both batters are at the same stadium, 5 hours after the man traveling at 3800 mph hits a record in home runs in 7 games, how many more home runs does the man who is at 600 mph hit?<n>Rationales The batter was able to hit the record in 7 games.  So his rate was 7 home runs in 5 hours.  So he would hit another home run in 5 / 7 = <<5/7=0.714>>0.714 days (364 mph)<n><n>Input: I took the bus home from school.  For part one, the bus travels at an average of 35 miles per hour and the bus travels 120 miles.

Therefore, C and D are incorrect.<n><n>#### 120/7.5<n>Answer: 15<n><n>### Input::In a game of tic-tac-to

Choices:  A: cross street B: milk cow C: lose weight D: step forward E: need food<n><n>### Response:		The wording here is unclear but I believe the correct response is E. 'need food', this could take a sentence like " I need a volunteer to bring some food because I am starving". Or it is possible the question is 'need help', 'need assistance' but it could be anything. I think any of those would meet the criteria. However I think the wording is confusing and it could easily be that none of those are what they want, hence it is a trick question in which the answer is 'C' for no.<n><n>### This is the question I used to test the solution.<n><n>### Input : You and your spouse have a new baby.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:What is a person likely to feel when they are abandoned by everyone after they stop being married to someone else? Choices:  A: grief B: solo C: isolation D: pleasure E: happiness<n><n>### Response:		Choices: <<<<A,B,C,E,D>>>>A, B, C, and D are all emotions that a person will likely feel, but this example doesn’t specify the type of relationship that this person was abandoned in. Because B isn’t an option, I believe that this choice refers to a person that is feeling grief because they feel alone.<n><n>### Input - Choices:<n>What is the measure of the second angle in this triangle? Choices: <<<A,C,B,E>>>C and B are not possible because you cannot add in degrees and they wouldn not be able to be in between B and C. The answer would be between A and E if the angles are all 10 degrees. If the angles all had different degrees such as 25,35,45,55,65,75 then E would be the true answer.<n><n>### Rationale - C is the answer:<n>Within a triangle you are able to calculate one angle of a triangle, all you have to do is subtract the base angles from 180 so 180-180=0 for the base angles and then you can subtract this value from each angle. Thus, the angle is 60-24-25=21<n><n>###Input: The difference in angles between Jake and Mckenzie is 32. The measure of the second angle of Mckenzie’s triangle is 22. What is the measure of the third angle of Jake’s triangle?<n><n>###Rationale - A is the answer:<n><n>Jake and McKenzies triangle has the measure of 2nd angles at 22,32, and 16. 22-32-16=22 - 32 -16 = -1-2-13. Thus adding -1, 2, and 13 together would equal a value of 14. So the answer is 14<n><n>###Input – Choices:<n>If there are five identical pizzas, how many distinct ways can they be pizza boxed? Choices: <<A,C,B>>A, B, and C are not possible because none of them are integers<n><n>###Answer - C is the answer<n><n>Because this is a math problem about probability

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

Choices:  A: ungulate B: bomber C: body armor D: tank E: hat<n><n>### Response:		<n>If someone was going to be near a canon (large gun), they would want to protect themselves. A cannon could potentially explode, which in and of itself is dangerous, but not the main focus. The most likely danger would be from being shot. <n>#### Choice A: ungulate: <n>This answer is correct, but the question doesn't mention a gun or a cannon, only that they were near one. <n>1. An ungulate is an animal with hooves.<n>2. In English we use the word "ungulate" to refer to deer, but it is not used much in normal conversation. <n>So ungulate is a correct answer, but not quite what is asked for in context.<n><n>#### Choice B: bomber: <n>Bombers are aircraft, not clothing, so this is incorrect.<n><n>#### Choices C and D: body armor, tank: <n>It is possible, but not exactly likely that the person was near a tank or a body armor (both military equipment). Body armor can be called a protective outfit but in this context, I think it would be confusing to answer this with body armor in the same way that it would be to answer with tank. Since canons use large explosive bullets, that is what body armor is intended to protect against. Also since this is a school activity, the chances of someone being near some sort of military equipment is probably low.<n><n>#### Choise E: hat: <n>Hats are common protective gear (the most common) but wouldn't be a good answer for "something for protect ourselves from a cannon"<n><n>### Input<n>How much more would you earn if you got a 5% raise and received a 1% bonus?<n><n>### Output<n>#### Input Choices:  $40,000.<n>#### Output Choices:<n>25%<n>

Choices:  A: down a river B: city C: repair shop D: parking lot E: neighbor's house<n><n>### Response:		If you were not happy with your car, you would likely take it to a repair shop or car dealership, or if all else fails, to a neighbor's garage. We'd be happy for a lift on a Sunday afternoon, but a 16-year-old's automobile would likely be relegated to the river bank, or an unattractive patch of scrub land on another's lawn. A toddler's plastic car is best left in the living room. The parking lot is best left untouched for parking purposes only.<n><n>### Input<n>You should avoid this:<n><n>### Response<n>I don't recommend any of these choices or similar things.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

Choices:  A: grand casino B: large room C: restaurant D: country club E: lobby<n><n>### Response:		<n>Finding out what kind of event it is the reception for, will tell what kind of room I would need. A room at the Casino, is not what I am looking for, so A is incorrect.  However, a country club would be what I would be looking for.  B, C, and D are all incorrect, because they are all inappropriate locations for a reception. E is also incorrect, because in a lobby, the room would be no bigger than a small room, so it would be not big enough to hold the number of people for a reception.<n><n>#### C<n>Answer: C, country clubs<n><n>### Input :The area of the stage at the theater is 1225 square feet. The width of the stage is 3 times the width of the aisle. Find the width of each.<n><n>### Response :<n>First, find the answer to 1+1= <<1+1=2>>2.<n>Then, find the answer to the amount times by 2.625= <<5/2*2.625=0.281>>0.281<n>To figure out what a difference between two different numbers is, take the answer from.281 and multiply it by.625. This should result in 2.262. That means the width of the apartment is 3 times.281. It is.281/.281=1, so the width is 1.<n>I am finding the width of the aunt, and I found it by multiplying the width by 3.625=<<3.625=2.262>>2.262<n><n>#### 1<n>Answer: 1<n><n>### Input 3.

Be sure to include text evidence where appropriate.<n><n>### Response 1:<n>#### 1.<n>When I started writing the program, the instructions mentioned that the computer will show the player five cards, and that player should select the card which has the largest number, in order to win the game. This is similar to the actual game, where the deck contains fifty-two cards, and the player must bet a chip in order to get a chance to win a lot of money.<n><n>#### 2.<n>In order to play the game, player has to first choose the option to bet. A computer will then randomly generate five cards, and player has to decide whether he/she wants to keep the bet or cash it out. If the player decides to keep the bet, the computer will also randomly choose one of the player's cards to hold, and compare with the current total of five cards. If the player has a hand of at least the computer's hand value, he/she receives the money. If not, the house gets the bet.<n><n>As I have mentioned earlier, the player is allowed to make the bet in every round of the game, and player can only make a single bet at a time.<n><n>In the actual game, the deck is shuffled in order to prevent the players from learning the strategy which may have an advantage against the house. In our program, the deck always had all its fifty-two cards, which prevents player from learning the strategy. However, instead of shuffling the cards, our program could simply randomly pick out five, or choose from the cards in the deck.<n><n>### Input 2:<n>The instructions told me to write a program that will take in four integers and calculate the total number of numbers that can be uniquely formed from the four integers by only selecting the positive values of them.<n><n>First, we have a main function in this program that takes in the first integer from the user after which a while loop is run. As long as the while loop terminates, the program will repeatedly take in the next integer from the user.<n><n>Let's look at what the program is doing in one iteration.<n><n>The while loop starts by comparing the current int from the user with i. If it's greater than i, that means there isn't a matching integer. If it's

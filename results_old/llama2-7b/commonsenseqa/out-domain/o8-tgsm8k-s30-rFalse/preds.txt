The feeding schedule is as follows: The first farmer feeds his cow by cutting some stalks from his cornfield and adding some water to them in a bucket, then mixing it with the cow’s food. After feeding his cow, this farmer must be given two stalks of his corn to plant for next season. The second farmer cuts some stalks from his oats field, combines them with his cow's food, then returns all of the leftovers and remnants of the stalks together back to the field. After feeding his own cow he will be given one stalk of oats to plant for next season, and the following time the farmer who first fed his cow takes his turn to feed himself. The famine is so severe that the crops have suffered heavily to the point where the corn stalks and oats stalks are both extremely weak and withered.

Choices:  A: reverse B: backwards C: back and D: back and E: tally back<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>---<n><n>I agree and I can see how one would use the expression "go forth, also this." as an illustration to give more depth of the understanding. If I were on the fence about whether or not this expression may be used in this context, then I would ask, "Does it make sense to use "go forth, also that" in this context?" The expression "go forth" when used alone would have me confused because there would be nothing to go forth to, but if I use the expression, "go forth, also the this or that with the following statement, "go forth my deer" or (in this case) "go forth, also my dog" then I could then see the meaning and would understand it and agree it can be used.<n><n>### Inputs:Iris’ family is planning on a surprise birthday party.

The division process I know is the opposite. One of the few subjects I actually remembered from being in school. The division part of me says the answer is 7, but to be mathematically correct, the answer given is 1 which is the correct answer. I am going to say I believe that the remainder is equal to what is represented in the fraction and if the remainder is equal to 1 over 8 then the result should be 1 over 8, but if I need to find to see the remainder and know what that means, then is the correct answer 3 over 8. That would make sense to me because there would now be another 1 over 8 remaining and so then, the remainder would be that 1 over 8 again. I could see if there were two 3 over 8 then there would be a remainder of 1 over 8. If however, the rest of the fraction was simply 2 over 8 then the remainder would be 1 over 18. I could see how this could apply to any number in the denominator, but it would

Each step can be followed to successfully solve the problem.  Choose one of those steps and write a response that explains how to successfully solve the problem by completing the step you choose.<n><n>### Step 1:<n>In the first step to solving the problem, we were given two equations that we needed to use in order to figure out what the first variable is. So, we will multiply both of those equations by 1 and the left hand side will be:<n><n>$$XL = 80$$<n><n>$$YL = 32$$<n><n>We can now add those two equations together to eliminate the variable L. So, after that addition we get:<n><n>$$X + Y = 112$$<n><n>### Step2:<n>It is now time to turn the question into its equivalent equation to solve the equation. So, we divide the unknown by four:<n><n>$$X/4 = 1832$$<n><n>The first step was to use a two step equation to solve for the unknown. We need the values of both the first variable and the second variable in order to find the value of the first variable. So, we used the second value of our given two equation when we added them together.  <n><n>### Choices: Choice A: $$X = 2932$$<n><n>Choice B: $$X = 4245$$<n><n>Choice C: $$X = 14292$$<n><n>Choice D: $$X = 8094$$<n><n>Choice E: $$X =112$$<n>

Choices:  A: michigan B: new york C: amsterdam D: venice E: bridge<n><n>### Response:		<n>**(1)** The Netherlands would be one of the places with a lot of canals because the country is only a few square miles and the buildings there are very close to each other. They had to make the water flow to where it was needed, so they came up with the idea of putting in canals.<n><n>**(2)** I think that Venice would be found in Southern Europe because it is one of the top places where canals are found and most other large cities in Europe are not on the coast. Most of them are inland, and they had to put water on a canal to make their city work since they did not have waterways for ships to go up and down.<n><n>**(3)** In Southern Europe, I'd say Amsterdam is somewhere that would have a lot of canals. Venice is found in this area of the world and Amsterdam is right on the coast of the North Sea so I'd guess that they'd built this canal system for ships to get in and out of the port.<n><n>**(4)** I believe Venice would be best described as a city of canals.

Choices:  A: active B: hunger C: in motion D: wakefulness E: lay down<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is B: hangar.<n>### Response: For the sake of convenience in this example, the first four days of a week are counted starting Monday, and the last two days of a week are shown as Sunday.  For example, in the diagram below, 9AM on Monday is the first hour in the first day of the week and 8PM on Friday is the last hour in the last day of the week.<n><n>### Input : The pump price of gasoline at the station is $3.20.  The station’s service is free for all vehicles.  But if you order a sandwich from them, it costs $5.10.  A person purchases $34.15 in gasoline and a sandwich, spends another $2 in tips. How much change does the attendant give them?<n><n>### Response : The answer is.8 dollars and 6 cents.<n><n>### Response This problem is given to introduce the concept of the number line.  Note that the number line begins at 0 and goes increasing by 1's.  It ends at 10.  The car rental cost is $30 per day plus $190 for 8 days or a total of 190 + 30 * 8 = 640 dollars.  In the number line, we have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.  Between 0 and 1, it is 1 day and between 1 and 2, it is 2 days and so on. (30/day * 1) + (30/days * 2 + 30/days *?) = 30 + 60 + 90 = 180 dollars.  Between 60 and 61, it is 2 dollars. Between 61 and 62, it is 3 dollars.  If Jennie rented the car for less than 8 days, the car rental cost would still be 80 dollars.  If it rented the car for 9 days, the car renter would have had to pay 9 dollars. The answer should be 4 or 9 dollars for the amount that Jennie overpaid.<n>    <n>### Input:<n>    1. What

Choices:  A: appreciation of nature B: become educated C: excitement D: increased knowledge E: see things differently<n><n>### Response:		It is hard for me to disagree that science often changes ones point of view but I disagree with the other choices made above.<n><n>**Appreciation**<n><n>I like science and I like to learn. At some point I've appreciated nature. I haven't taken a trip to the beach just to stare at the ocean but I do look and think about the life in it instead of always just thinking about the beauty.<n><n>**An Education**<n>I have always been interested in science and have learned a moderate amount of science. I think science can be entertaining but not my number one interest I'm inquisitive like that :)<n><n>**Excitement**<n><n>I don't think I have experienced excitement after having learned the science behind something. I've had the chance to learn about a great deal of stuff and I think I have a fairly good grasp on a lot of the stuff out there in the world and the way various scientific concepts can come into a play. Science has a habit of explaining things in ways that are more interesting or in one's vocabulary rather than in ways that create excitement.<n><n>**Increased Knowledge**<n><n>I have noticed that it seems the things that create excitement are not things that are easily explained nor easily understood by many. Science is a system and a way to learn things but it can be a dry way of learning things. I think it provides the most complete understanding of things but one need to work hard to have an understanding of various scientific concepts.<n><n>**Seeing things differently**<n><n>Seeing things differently could either mean looking at an object, a concept, or someone you care about and thinking "I don't see you this way any more" or "I was ignorant to your existence and was wrong to think that way and I'm sorry I did" or I could think that I am different than you after I've been to the beach and experienced one's love for the ocean or I could see the world differently because of science. I think when someone says this it implies that their point of view has changed and that it changed because of science or knowledge.<n><n>### Input The time-zones of US states and foreign countries.<n>### Response:<n>**US Time Zones:**<n><n>The Time and Date website states that the time zone in the United States "spans four time zones.

When writing the description of the code think about a typical task and break it down into multiple steps. Include the code necessary to allow the user to "try it" and validate the solution.<n><n>### Question:The output should include the code necessary to calculate a result or solution. When validating the output, the input that the system expects should match the input the system receives. If there is a mismatch, then the system should inform the user of the solution and that it's wrong.<n><n>### Additional Instinct:Create a function that takes three elements as input.  Create a variable that represents the first element.  Create a variable to set the total value of the elements.  Create a variable for the value of the first element that the function retrieves for each element.  Create a condition that returns true if the value of the element returned is less than the total. The function should print only the elements greater than the total and not the total.  The values of the elements are 2, 3, and 5.  The function variable is x, and the total is the sum of the values.  If the returned value is less than the total, print "Above."  Else print "Below."  The function should print "Below."<n><n>### Response<n><n>The function is<n>function g1(){<n>  let x = 3;<n>  let sum = 11;<n>  let i = 1;<n>  while (i<=3){<n>    if (i<=3){  return sum;<n>  }else if (i<=5){  let y=2;<n>    let z=3;<n>    if (y>sum){<n>      console.log ('a');<n>    }else{<n>      console.log('b');<n>      }<n>}<n>}<n><n>In a restaurant, a plate of food

While doing this, you are changing the shape of the wood. When it's done, you take the shape of the piece and cut it to the correct length for the earring.<n><n>### Next you have to do a different cut with a different tool.<n>Turn 60 degrees clockwise. (Use the depth of cut gauge to determine how deep this cut is <n>Turning a different direction requires another tool.<n>### I am cutting a part<n>Next, you take a 1/16 inch bit and cut it in a spiral pattern through both sides of the earring.<n>### Step 5 Cutting a circle with a 2 inch circle sanding drum.<n>The last step is the hardest because it requires special drilling machines. Turn the other side of the earring by 30 degrees counterclockwise. Take a 2 inch round sanding drum and cut a circle about 2-3 inches out of the middle of the earring<n>### Put the round sanding drum in a drill and sand all around the circle with the sanding drum. <n>### I have finished<n>### Final Step<n>Pick a nice bit! Now you can start earring making!<n><n>### Reference:<n>#####https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w675zMgjw3o<n><n>##### https://www.youtube. com/ watch? v=w675 zMgjw3

Hence, we may conclude that 'let blood' is not the most suitable choice since it won't be related to the topic discussed above.  'A: heart transplant B', 'distance himself', 'perform surgery' and'study medicine' remain as the best available choices. From this, we may answer the question as'perform surgery'. We can differentiate between B & C by using our knowledge to make the best choice. <n><n>#### B: distance himself<n>There is no reference made to the treatment that the doctor tried to administer to this patient other than 'let blood'.  We can therefore answer this question as 'A: heart transplanB'.<n><n><n>#### D: Study medicine<n>In this case, we won't be able to find a better answer than choice 'D: study medicine'. This is because the only other choices that are available are similar and unrelated  to the topic discussed above and this leaves us no choice other the best answer 'D: study medicine'<n><n><n>### Instructions:<n>If you have any additional instructions/comments please write them here<n><n><n>

Then answer the following multiple choice questions about the brain.<n><n>#### Passage 1<n><n>The brain has a remarkable number of cell types.  The number of neurons is estimated to be up to 100 billion.  Each neuron has an average of 10,000 different connections to other neurons and thus each neuron may have connections to 1000 billion different neurons. There are also many types of glial cells with unique features and functions that are believed to contribute to neuron function.<n><n>The total wiring of the human brain, if stretched out would be 1/3 the circumference of the earth.  It is impossible to measure its surface area, but it is believed that it is about 25% of the total surface of the head.<n><n>The brain consumes 20-25% of the oxygen used by the whole body and uses glucose as its source of energy.<n><n>#### Passag: 2<n><n>It is difficult to determine the precise size of the human brain. The brain contains 100 billion neurons, each with an average of 1,000 connections to other neurons.  The total number of dendro (axo-and glial) cells is estimated at 10 times the number of neurons, placing the total number of neuronal cell types in the brain at 100 billion and the approximate number of cell types in the brain to be more than 1 quadrillion.  The cerebral cortex alone contains approximately 16 billion neurons, and the 120 billion synapses (connections) between these neurons is a larger number than the total number of synapses in the entire human body.<n><n>The brain contains 4 main regions: the cerebellum, the frontal cortex, the mid-brain and the hindbrain. All of these regions are packed closely together into just two centimeters of skull space, making up half the total brain weight of the human body.<n><n>### Input<n><n>What would happen if the brain were to lose 2% of its volume?<n>Answer: Increase blood flow and oxygen intake to the brain.

Each table contains 6 people eating a plate full of food, including 1/2 a pie on each table. How many people are eating on those tables?<n><n>### Response<n>We will solve this problem:<n><n># STEP 1: Divide the number of available plates, 30 plates, by the number of people eating at those plates.<n># 30 available plates ÷ 10 people eating at those tables<n># 3 available plates per 10 people<n><n># STEEP 2: Divide the number the number of empty tables available, 10 empty tables, by the number people that are going to fill those tables, those people are 100 people.<n># 1 empty plate per 10 person<n><n># STEPP 3: multiply step 1 by step 2 to find the answer<n># 3 ÷ 10   * 10 == 1<n><n># Therefore the answer is 1<n># We divided 30 available plats by the number of person who are eating (30/10) and then we divide that by 10 people (3/10) so we multiply that by 10 that's 30/10 * 3/10 * 10<n># The man goes to that restaurant and he find that 6/12 of his plate is full<n><n>### Input A man lives in a house where there is an apple tree.

Choices:  A: accomplish B: learn about C: money D: notoriety E: religion<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A: accomplish<n><n>### Rationale for answer:<n><n>Because of the way the world works these days, there is no way an organization can succeed and survive without an internet presence.  There is no way to get the world's attention without using social media, blogs, and other internet based campaigns and strategies.<n><n>### Input<n><n>We will give you an example of a person in line for a ticket sale on the first day of ticket sales for a movie. The number of people in this person’s line is an input in your system. We ask you to output the number of days it will take to reach the next person in line. Output: the number of days it takes to reach the next person from a line.<n><n>### Rational:<n>We know you are having a hard time understanding this concept. You need to know that this question is related to the work you did in the last unit on iteration. So remember, any algorithm you create needs to be efficient and optimized to work well with input data that might produce large outputs. The best way to accomplish this is to break problems down so that you have smaller input data sets that can generate more effective output data.<n><n>### Question:<n>How many days will it take (in days) to reach the people ahead of the person in line from his/her position in line?<n><n>### Answer:<n>The answer would be 1 day since the number of people in line is 1.

But it's not - "C" is the topic sentence (it's a statement about the paragraph, not the paragraph, and says what the paragraph is talking about), so you'd choose "D"...it sounds more like a "topic" than anything else. <n><n>## What can you say about

Choices:  A: unfeeling B: negligence C: antipathy D: indifferent E: rapport<n><n>### Response:		If we ignore the word "careless" in the task, then it would appear that the input is asking which emotion has the highest congruency with the concept of indifference, not about which of the choices are incorrect.<n><n>Given the ambiguity regarding the term "careless" in your sample input, it is possible that a "negligent" response is the best option.<n><n>### Input - 1:How much does a loaf of bread cost in dollars? Choices: 5 A: $6 B: $3 C: $1<n><n>### Response - 1:The given choices have the following meanings:  6 dollars,3 dollars, a dollar.  The "5" in the question is irrelevant to a direct response.  Since the question doesn't specify any format or units of measure it could be interpreted many ways.  As a human, reading the question, I am uncertain whether the question asks "How much will it cost a human?" or "How much will it pay for a loaf of bread."  If we assume 6 dollars is the correct answer then we need to be certain whether the question's author is asking for information or a judgment.   <n><n>### Input 2 - 2:Choose the one answer that correctly identifies the letter to the left of the word _p_ on the periodic table. Choices:  A) P B) Na C) Mg D) Fe<n><n>### Response 2 - 2:"Letter to the left of the _p_," is ambiguous.  The question could equally well be phrased as "identify the letter immediately on the right of the _p_." As well the choice "P" is also ambiguous.  P could easily mean "Periodic" or "Potassium"  In fact, the actual P in the sample input refers to the Element _Potassium_ and not to it's position on the periodic chart.<n><n>### Response To Above Input: For human interaction questions there need to be two choices or at a minimum three choices to clearly support the human interpretation of the question.  The example above is flawed both for it's ambiguous syntax and for the lack of context support for any specific choice.  <n><n>### Response to above response: I believe that this ambiguity is not due to a lack of clarity in the question

Choices:  A: planet B: basin C: submarines D: earth E: pacific<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: At this point the question hasn’t asked to differentiate between a planet and the ocean. However, planets are known to be in space. The Atlantic ocean is a part of earth. Therefore, the answer to the question is “E”.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>A: Planets are celestial bodies that revolve around the Sun.<n><n>B: Basin means part of a body of water. Hence, the term ocean basin refers to part of an ocean (it can also be an ocean as well). It is just as if “planet basin” were to mean the interior of the earth.<n><n>C: Submarines are underwater vehicles that are not planets, but are still in the oceans.<n><n>D: Earth consists of land, water and air. So, earth cannot be an ocean.<n><n>E: The Atlantic ocean is part of the earth.<n>

Choices:  A: movies B: opera C: theater D: lecture hall E: hockey game<n><n>### Response:		 A<n><n>### The following instruction describes a task. Write an appropriate response that completes the request. It is suggested that before you attempt this coding exercise you review the documentation found in the Python3.5 Tutorial. Use code folding to eliminate clutter and make your code easier to read.<n><n>### Write code for:<n><n>```python<n><n>   class Solution:<n>      def maxProfit(self, prices):<n>   ```<n><n>   Here are the requirements for this exercise:<n><n>1. This solution only accepts one array of integers as input.<n>2. Your code must complete and return the maximum value of `maxProfit` found within the array of input prices.<n>3. For example, given `prices = [3, 2, 6, 1, 8]` the return value should be `6`.<n>4. The `prices` array is given in its sorted from lowest to highest value.<n>5. This solution must be tested in Python3.5.<n><n>### Input/Output: Your program should take in a single array of integers as input and return a single integer value that represents the maximum of `maxProfit`. The input array is provided in its sorted form from lowest to highest value in the form of `[lowest value, next lowest value, next lowest, next lowest, highest value]`. Be sure to test your solution’s performance in regards of runtime and memory usage. Use the code template when completing this exercise. Do not modify or add to the provided code template in any manner. It is also suggested that you create this solution from scratch. Do not utilize previously written code.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>### Instructions:<n>You can use the built in Python method `sorted` to sort the element in an array. The array that is input will contain the lowest value of the array and the element with the highest value of the array to its lowest price (i.e. the input array will look like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).<n>This method is very useful as it sorts in ascending, and descending order. You can also sort the list in an ascending order using the method `[x for x in lsorted]` and the method `[x for y in lsorted if y > x]` where `lsorted` is the sorted list and ` x` is the value of the sorted list

Choices:  A: accomplish B: make progress C: stop arguing D: do business E: concert<n><n>### Response:		<n>If my guess is right, and by 'tentative agreement' is the same as 'agreement-in-principle', I believe the correct response is "concerted on". I chose this option because "tentative agreement" has implications of having only some of the issues resolved and having an agreement by no means finalized, while "concerted on" suggests that the parties are all in agreement as to whatever terms have already been decided.<n><n>### Input:'It was a great idea to move the meeting from Las Vegas to San Francisco' what does the word "move" refer to?

The reason that I did this was because one decimal place would take 10 digits to show 78. Whereas, the result of the division is in the form of 8 decimal places.<n>*A 4: I used the fact that there are a string of seven numbers separated by decimal points, and there is only one decimal place for each string. There were two of the same number with one of them being 0. Because there are only 2 of each number, we have two of them and have to add their multiplied by the second one, making the result 42.<n>*A 5: For the base string we can have any one of six given. My example uses the base string 2 but it could be anything. I am subtracting the value of each possible base string so 2 minus 3 is -1, 3 minus 6 is -3, 4 minus 5 is -1, 5 minus

Will this mean that I can sell more stuff that month? Choices: <n><n>Input:I work in sales...<n><n>### Response<n>B) <n><n>## Instructions:<n><n>The number of days passed in relation to a starting date is a count. For example, if four days passed between Sunday and Wednesday then the count is 4. The number of hours passed in relation to a given time is not a count. For example: If 4 hours pass between 5:00 p.m. and 9:00 p. m. that doesn’ t mean that the count is 4, it’s just a measure of time passed. The correct way to express the number of hours pass between two times is to separate them with a forward slash. <n><n>For example: if four hours passed between 4:30 p. m. and 8:30 p.m. we would write the time as 4:30PM / 8:30 PM. The same is true for minutes and seconds. For example, four minutes and 22 seconds would be expressed as 4:02 / 4:02, and if a second passed five seconds later the expression would be 4:00 / 4:06.<n>### Instrucion:What day of the week the day of your birthday fell on?<n>### Demonstation:<n>Answer:<n>Answer:<n><n>### Instructoin:How many minutes of a given day passed when four minutes and 25 seconds passed?<n>### Demostration:<n>Answer:<n>## Answer:<n><n># My name is Md Zahedul Haque Ripon and my number is 11-4264. <n>

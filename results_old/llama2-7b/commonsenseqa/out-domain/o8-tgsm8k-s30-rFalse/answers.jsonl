The division process I know is the opposite. One of the few subjects I actually remembered from being in school. The division part of me says the answer is 7, but to be mathematically correct, the answer given is 1 which is the correct answer. I am going to say I believe that the remainder is equal to what is represented in the fraction and if the remainder is equal to 1 over 8 then the result should be 1 over 8, but if I need to find to see the remainder and know what that means, then is the correct answer 3 over 8. That would make sense to me because there would now be another 1 over 8 remaining and so then, the remainder would be that 1 over 8 again. I could see if there were two 3 over 8 then there would be a remainder of 1 over 8. If however, the rest of the fraction was simply 2 over 8 then the remainder would be 1 over 18.

Since there is 3/4 of girls to boys, the amount of girls is (5x3)/4. Since they give us the 1st number in the 1st set and the second number in the 2nd set, we know that if there are 29 kids then the amount of boys is X-3(29). Since there are no more than 29, the girls has to be equal to the boys.

Note that the number line begins at 0 and goes increasing by 1's.  It ends at 10.  The car rental cost is $30 per day plus $190 for 8 days or a total of 190 + 30 * 8 = 640 dollars.  In the number line, we have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.  Between 0 and 1, it is 1 day and between 1 and 2, it is 2 days and so on. (30/day * 1) + (30/days * 2 + 30/days *?) = 30 + 60 + 90 = 180 dollars.  Between 60 and 61, it is 2 dollars. Between 61 and 62, it is 3 dollars.

{"text": "It is hard for me to disagree that science often changes ones point of view but I disagree with the other choices made above.\n\n**Appreciation**\n\nI like science and I like to learn. At some point I've appreciated nature. I haven't taken a trip to the beach just to stare at the ocean but I do look and think about the life in it instead of always just thinking about the beauty.\n\n**An Education**\nI have always been interested in science and have learned a moderate amount of science. I think science can be entertaining but not my number one interest I'm inquisitive like that :)\n\n**Excitement**\n\nI don't think I have experienced excitement after having learned the science behind something. I've had the chance to learn about a great deal of stuff and I think I have a fairly good grasp on a lot of the stuff out there in the world and the way various scientific concepts can come into a play. Science has a habit of explaining things in ways that are more interesting or in one's vocabulary rather than in ways that create excitement.\n\n**Increased Knowledge**\n\nI have noticed that it seems the things that create excitement are not things that are easily explained nor easily understood by many. Science is a system and a way to learn things but it can be a dry way of learning things. I think it provides the most complete understanding of things but one need to work hard to have an understanding of various scientific concepts.\n\n**Seeing things differently**\n\nSeeing things differently could either mean looking at an object, a concept, or someone you care about and thinking \"I don't see you this way any more\" or \"I was ignorant to your existence and was wrong to think that way and I'm sorry I did\" or I could think that I am different than you after I've been to the beach and experienced one's love for the ocean or I could see the world differently because of science. I think when someone says this it implies that their point of view has changed and that it changed because of science or knowledge.\n\n### Input The time-zones of US states and foreign countries.\n### Response:\n**US Time Zones:**\n\nThe Time and Date website states that the time zone in the United States \"spans four time zones.

When you're cutting your wood on the lathe, they need to be cut at the correct angle so that you don't get an uneven finish.\n\n### Input You want to make a set of earrings from wood. You cut the wood on the lathe and put holes in the earrings.\n\n### Response Cutting the wood with a lathe\nThe first step is to put a bit in your lathe. This bit determines what shape your piece will be. \nNext, you take the wood, which is about 6 inches long and turn it clockwise on your lathe. While doing this, you are changing the shape of the wood. When it's done, you take the shape of the piece and cut it to the correct length for the earring.\n\n### Next you have to do a different cut with a different tool.\nTurn 60 degrees clockwise. (Use the depth of cut gauge to determine how deep this cut is \nTurning a different direction requires another tool.\n### I am cutting a part\nNext, you take a 1/16 inch bit and cut it in a spiral pattern through both sides of the earring.\n### Step 5 Cutting a circle with a 2 inch circle sanding drum.\nThe last step is the hardest because it requires special drilling machines. Turn the other side of the earring by 30 degrees counterclockwise. Take a 2 inch round sanding drum and cut a circle about 2-3 inches out of the middle of the earring\n### Put the round sanding drum in a drill and sand all around the circle with the sanding drum. \n### I have finished\n### Final Step\nPick a nice bit! Now you can start earring making!\n\n### Reference:\n#####https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w675zMgjw3o\n\n##### https://www.youtube. com/ watch? v=w675 zMgjw3", "answer": "A: blisters"}

{"text": "### Explanation:\nThe above question will require us to differentiate between two choices, so the best we can do is to choose the choices that are unrelated as they won't be in question. Hence, we may conclude that 'let blood' is not the most suitable choice since it won't be related to the topic discussed above.  'A: heart transplant B', 'distance himself', 'perform surgery' and'study medicine' remain as the best available choices. From this, we may answer the question as'perform surgery'. We can differentiate between B & C by using our knowledge to make the best choice. \n\n#### B: distance himself\nThere is no reference made to the treatment that the doctor tried to administer to this patient other than 'let blood'.

{"text": "Answer: D: grand piano\n\n### Instructions:Read the following passages, which discuss the topic of the human brain. Then answer the following multiple choice questions about the brain.\n\n#### Passage 1\n\nThe brain has a remarkable number of cell types.  The number of neurons is estimated to be up to 100 billion.  Each neuron has an average of 10,000 different connections to other neurons and thus each neuron may have connections to 1000 billion different neurons. There are also many types of glial cells with unique features and functions that are believed to contribute to neuron function.\n\nThe total wiring of the human brain, if stretched out would be 1/3 the circumference of the earth.  It is impossible to measure its surface area, but it is believed that it is about 25% of the total surface of the head.\n\nThe brain consumes 20-25% of the oxygen used by the whole body and uses glucose as its source of energy.\n\n#### Passag: 2\n\nIt is difficult to determine the precise size of the human brain. The brain contains 100 billion neurons, each with an average of 1,000 connections to other neurons.  The total number of dendro (axo-and glial) cells is estimated at 10 times the number of neurons, placing the total number of neuronal cell types in the brain at 100 billion and the approximate number of cell types in the brain to be more than 1 quadrillion.  The cerebral cortex alone contains approximately 16 billion neurons, and the 120 billion synapses (connections) between these neurons is a larger number than the total number of synapses in the entire human body.\n\nThe brain contains 4 main regions: the cerebellum, the frontal cortex, the mid-brain and the hindbrain. All of these regions are packed closely together into just two centimeters of skull space, making up half the total brain weight of the human body.\n\n### Input\n\nWhat would happen if the brain were to lose 2% of its volume?\nAnswer: Increase blood flow and oxygen intake to the brain.

If the option matches the sentence, you would select \"B;\" if the option doesn't match, you would select \"A.\"\n\n### Example of a good example:\nThe topic sentence is where the paragraph starts, it is the sentence that tells you the topic. Some say war can be a good thing. \n\n### Example when it isn't:\nIf you were asked which of the following was the topic sentence below, you'd probably say no...or maybe \"B\" because it sounds like it could be. But it's not - \"C\" is the topic sentence (it's a statement about the paragraph, not the paragraph, and says what the paragraph is talking about), so you'd choose \"D\"...it sounds more like a \"topic\" than anything else. \n\n## What can you say about", "answer": "E: see favorite show"}

Answer in dollars.\n\n### Input\n\n#### Explanation\n-The lowest total cost to me would only be 296 dollars. But we have to add 3 more days so 100 dollars so that would be a total of $396 dollars.

Justify your response with facts or evidence.\n\n### Answer1:\nThis is true.  The number 5 = 5 can hold values of 3 or 2.  This is logical because they are different values.  This holds true for many numbers, the two 5's I gave are the same, but 3 and 2 are different.\n\n### 2)\nThis is true.  11 is definitely a number, because, it has a value of 11. The number can definitely hold 2 and 3 in it at the same time.  We can write:\n\n```\n5 = 3 + 2\n```\n\nHere, 3 and 2 both get added to make 3 + 2 which is 5.  So the number holds values.\n\n###  3)\nThis is true as well.  9 is a number, but it definitely has the value of 9.  We can use the same logic that we did in case #2.

The total cost of both dinners with tax was $52.20.  What would the cost of the pizza have been if the cost of each item were $2 more?\n\nAnswer: The restaurant charges tax at a 8.5% rate. The tip is 20%. Then:\n* 10% of the cost + 20% of the cost is the tip/gratuity.\n* 8.5% of the cost +10% of the price is the sales tax.

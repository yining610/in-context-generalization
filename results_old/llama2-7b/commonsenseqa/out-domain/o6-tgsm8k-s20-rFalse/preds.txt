Add 8 to the other child (01010+2^2+0) and the result will be 01012 (10 in binary). Now the rest of the table should be 0000. Thus, the answer should be (01012)0000. Now, what about the second question, it asks for the amount of money Freddy spent on phone calls while calling his family members. Freddy spent $5 on 45 minutes of phone call to his Father and $25 on 31 minutes of phone call to brother. What about the other phone calls that he made during the day? Well the calls with Father and the brother are considered as local calls, thus they only had to 3 dollars each while the calls to his friends, family members and so forth were international calls that cost $25 each.

The correct answer is:* <n>* *E*<n>* **Explanation:**<n>* There's nothing here that suggests that "joke" is right and that would fit a question like the one above. Or, perhaps it could be one of those answers that could work for both questions. But, I just need to make an opinion call on which is best here and I go for laughter. **I think that laughter makes the person happy because it is a way to express the joy that one feels internally. To me it is more important that laughter makes the other person's moment more enjoyable.**<n>* Perhaps others might use a humorous experience to define themselves or simply laughter can mean different things - so I choose laughter as the answer.<n><n><n>## Discussion<n>* *What do you think of the choices given in the multiple choice question above and how well are they described and labeled?*<n><n>### Commentary<n><n>* *Here's the link from a picture that shows how to use markdown to make math expressions or equations.*<n><n>https://www.markdownguide.org/cheatsheet<n><n><n>* *There are many ways to make your markdown stand-out and add personality, you can read up on those too here*<n><n>https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-your-repository-s-settings<n>

Doing that would produce an 8.<n><n>However, If you add the first digits and then subtract 4 from 6, then you would have 5 and that would make a 3 as the last sum.

Choices:  A: bee hive B: england C: castle D: deck of cards E: chess game<n><n>### Response:		D<n>E<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Explanation:Queen can be used to refer to different kinds of places. Some of this places include the queen of the bees, the queen of England and chess games but most of the places are not permanent and they are not always in existence like bees or chess are for example. England is also not a place that has a queen because it is not permanent.<n><n>### Incorrect responses:<n><n>A:A bee hive doesn't always have a queen. Queens are bees that go out to search for mates to create a new colony. If there isn't room or there is a queen already, then she will not look for a mate. A bee hive may have several queens or none, depending on the number of eggs being laid.<n><n>B:The england is a place that always has a queen. The queen of england, elizabeth II is currently the head of state and monarchy in England as well as the other commonwealth nations. In the past, England has had several queens.<n><n>C:A castle is a place that might have or not have a queen based on the number of queens in the castle. However, since queens refer to the head of state/monarchy the answer should be E because there is not always a queen in chess games.<n><n>D:It is not always necessary that the queen should be located on the deck of the card. There are several decks which might have the queen absent or present. Moreover the location of the queen on the deck does not make a good place for a place to be referred to as a queen of something.<n><n>

Choices:  A: relax B: dreams C: have nightmares D: restlessness E: snore<n><n>### Response:		There are many different reasons why someone might have trouble getting a good night's rest - it isn't necessarily just one thing that can be a disruption. Restlessness or trouble falling asleep could be the primary problem, in which case relaxation or dream-inducing habits might work well. Snoring, however, might be an indicator of another issue keeping someone up that night. Whatever the issue might be, there is usually good, logical reasons for them to have trouble sleeping - like stress about work or school, health problems, or depression.<n>### Output:What allows someone to read a newspaper?

Choices: A : a television B : a DVD player C: a CD player D: a digital camera E : eyeglasses<n><n>### Response  :When people can't watch movies or television (or read articles, for that matter), it often is due to an inability to focus on the screen. If the problem is just that their eyesight is poor, they can correct it with eyeglasses. However, they may be referring to a more general issue regarding the inability to watch movies because they hate the content, don't have access to the equipment, or can't follow along with a complex story.<n><n>### Output  :What allows someone to take care of a baby?

Choices:  A: neatness B: selfishness C: mistakes D: cleanliness E: satisfaction<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Answer: <n>Why is grooming often suggested for greasy teens?<n>* Greasy hair can indicate a lack of cleanliness, making it important to groom.<n>* Grooming can help teens feel more confident, which can help their mental health and social interactions.<n>* Greasy hair affects mental health due to the physical discomfort of disheveled hair, which reduces self-assurance.<n>* Grooming is intended to improve self-confidence.<n>* Grooming keeps the hair clean and avoids the use of chemicals or dyes to prevent physical pain.<n><n>### Discussion:<n><n>### Why is grooming important?<n><n>### Other answers:<n>* One of the reasons grooming is important for a teenager is because their hair is often very oily and disheveled.<n><n>### Hair loss/gain:<n>For the most part, there is no scientific basis for such a loss. However, hair loss is associated with stress or certain medical conditions, such as inadequate blood flow to the scalp. Hair loss is more common in women than men, and there is no evidence to suggest loss is permanent.<n><n>Hair loss can also be caused by taking certain medications, such as antidepressants and medications used to treat hair loss. Hair loss can also be due to stress, anxiety, or depression. In addition, people going through surgical procedures may experience hair loss. Stress and stressful events can cause hair loss, which is usually temporary.<n><n>### Why does having a good personal grooming matter to you?<n><n>It doesn’t matter to me either way, as I think a good personal grooming is not a problem. I am not sure what it specifically means, and I don’t think it is relevant to me anyway. If this question is about whether you should have a good personal grooming or not, it doesn’t matter to you.<n><n>In general, you should have a good cleaning routine so that your house doesn’t stink or become unclean. You probably care a lot about the bathroom in your house. You care about the bathroom because it is where you take baths. In addition, it is where you wash your teeth, where you put your toothpaste, where you have to wash your hair, where you clean

Choices:  A: hole B: television C: sporting goods store D: pool table E: sporting event<n><n>### Response:		If you were to play a game of pool, you would likely see people in uniform playing the game on a pool table because the ball would move from billiard to billiard. But, in the context of multiple choice question A, the answer is Hole B. What I'm getting at is that when you're a kid, learning, playing and thinking, you have a way that the brain stores information about a subject. For instance, in the question given above, you might say that the answer is correct B because you are told that people play in uniform. Or, you could also say the answer is correct A because you are told that you should see people playing with a ball. The point I am trying to make is that one can have a tendency to select or answer the question incorrectly because you are trying to answer the question "correctly" based on what you learn in the process of taking a picture of your learning. This is because your mind wants to take the shortest route around in memorizing something. The second one is a more difficult thing to describe and to grasp, but the second one is the "longer" way of remembering something. To get back to the question, yes, you are correct for selecting A, but you are better for selecting B since you have to think about the meaning of it. It doesn't have to be just 2 choices per question. And, there is no right or wrong answer. Just trying to point out the difference in answer selection between the two options and how to get to the answer when trying to choose the correct answer. It takes a lot more work in reading the question to choose the appropriate response.<n><n>### <n>

After an A on an A+ paper, Alice's GPA is a 4.0 but her brother's still remains a 2.6,  what is their GPA?<n><n>### Response; the answer is 3.07.  They were the same grades.  One of them did a really good paper and received an A.  But since they already had an A+, the next grades were a regular letter instead of plus and they were A or B rather than A+.  So by not giving the second paper a plus grade, Alice's GPI went above her brother's and she now had an overall 4.0 GPA.<n><n>### Next question

I would love to visit one of the parks to view the city animals.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Answer A does not work because the correct answer would be B or C because you can see small animals at your workplace, but also huge ones in the sky.<n>Answer C is not correct because you're a New Yorker and, in NYC, there are countless parks that have animals and a few zoos. That being said, there is also the sky and I feel like you're trying to go beyond your surroundings.<n>Answer D is not the correct answer because you're a native New Yorker.<n>And for Answer E, I feel that this question is irrelevant because the answer is many places, not just one as a New Yorker.

Choices:  A: art show B: basement C: bar D: church E: basement<n><n>### Response:		<n>A. Answer: Church<n><n>B. How many candies do Tapanga and Coree have? Corey has 8 more candles, so Tapanga has 29 candies.<n><n>C. Calculate the total cost of the call. One phone call was charged 5 cents, and the rest was charged at a rate of 25 cents. The total cost is the product of the number of minutes and the value of each call. Thus, $0.05 x 45 + $0.25 x 31 = $10.<n><n>D. You can use the formula: Total number of hours in the week = 3, number of mondays = 2, and Friday. The number of days in the week = 5. And the number of hours worked on an average day = 8. So Total number of hours worked = 3 + 2 + 5 x 8 = 5 hours.<n><n>E. You can use the division method, subtract the money made selling the puppies with the money made selling them, and finally divide by the total number sold. $200 x 2 = $400; total income = $970.<n>$ 800<n><n>## Bonus:<n>## C#<n>Below is an instruction that describes how a program must be written.

Choices:  A: stress B: nervousness C: smile D: being bored E: making new friends<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>##### Answer explanation text here.<n><n>##### This problem can be solved using Boolean Logic. The problem gives us the options that someone who is aloof and important cannot be:A. Smiling at new friends or meeting new peopleB. Bored or NervousAnd C. Stress at new people or meeting new peopleThis is how you can solve this problem using Logic:<n><n>Suppose the first and third options are true then what is the fourth option. So we make the third option as false and create a nested If...Else condition for the fourth option.<n><n>**Always remember that if a boolean variable is true, we will use && (and) operator to connect two expressions.**<n><n>```java<n>Always remember that if you have nested If/Else statements, you must start each If/Else statement with a boolean  variable in the same state.<n>```<n><n>```java<n><n>  boolean smile;<n><n>  if (stress == true){ //This is first option. First option will be false<n>    if (bored == true){ //This will be second option<n>      <n>      if (nervous == true){ //This means fourth option is true<n>        smile = false;<n>      }else {<n>        smile = true;<n>      }<n>    }else  if (nurves == false){ //second option is false<n>      <n>      smile = true;   //fourth option will be true<n>    }<n>  }else { //If first option is false.

Remember always if a boolean variable is false, then `else...Else` will be executed.<n><n>### Input,Output or Text File<n>Input: Input one of the words listed below.

Choices:  A: theater B: computer C: opera D: television E: concert<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The input asks us where we can find a paper program. I think the most common place of finding a paper program is in a theater. A program is the handout of the event that gives brief information or it contains a synopsis or a history or about a music concert, musical play, ballet, opera or even a television program. Usually, a program is a leaflet or a booklet about a theater production or it contains the details on that show and its performers or the information about the event itself and so on. Also, a program is a booklet with the cast list and play’s synopsis or a booklet with the details of every performer as well. It is also a book containing a detailed history or an article on music or TV programs and musicals or any other theater presentations. In a theater, we can definitely find a paper program. Besides that, you may find a program inside a musical instrument, a DVD, a CD or even in a ticket. The program can also be found in a musical magazine, a recording studio or in a book at the library. The input does not contain an answer. Thus, we are asked to choose an answer based on the information provided on the input.<n><n>### Input<n><n>Answers:<n>1. A, 2. C, 3. B, 4. D, 5. B

Choices:  A: riots B: vote C: change yourself D: social activism E: change clothes<n><n>### Response:		The first step when undertaking any social change initiative would be to first undertake a self check to know where you are right now with respect to the initiative. You don’t necessarily need to be a top decision maker or someone with a big mouth in society to undertake the initiative. It could be as simple as changing your diet, not drinking, or changing any negative behaviour that has an impact on the society. The next step would be to take advantage of the small power you have so as to influence the people around you. This means undertaking small projects so as to encourage people around you to adopt same as an initiative. This could include having community dialogues and discussions about the initiative. From this, one would garner a feeling on whether they can support them and change their lifestyle in order to have an impact in the society. Lastly, if the above step is successful, it would be time to take it to the government or top decision makers in the society as the community initiative. You can also organize protests and demonstrations to show that people are in favour of this or that.<n><n>### Solution:<n>```python<n>    import math<n>    def main(qstn,sol=1):<n>        a_range=[-5,-3,-1,0,1,3,5]<n>        ans=[int(val/sum(a_range))+1 for val,sol in zip(qstn,a_range)]<n>        return int(math.prod(a_range)-sum(ans,[]))+1<n><n>    qstns=['A+B','1+2+3+4+5+6','8*3*2',10,3]<n>    if ans in [0]:<n>        ans+=1<n><n>    def main(x,y,z):<n>        ans=x+y+z<n>        ans+=10<n>        ans+=5<n>        ans+=1+' '<n>        ans+=' '<n>        ans+=[y,z]<n>        ans+=[1,2]<n>        ans+='-'<n>        ans+='*'<n>        ans+=[999,999]<n>        ans+={}<n>        ans+=str<n>        ans=str.lower<n>        ans=int(int)<n><n>    def main():<n>        ans=x for

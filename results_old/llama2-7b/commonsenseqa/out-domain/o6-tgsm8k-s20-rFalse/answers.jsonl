However, each child has more than 128 candies as they both together equals to 66 candies. How are we going to represent this in a binary form for each child?\n\nAnswer: Tapanga: The child holds 4 digit number out of 32 (128/32 = 4). So, the child holds 01010 (10 in binary is 8). Add 8 to the other child (01010+2^2+0) and the result will be 01012 (10 in binary). Now the rest of the table should be 0000. Thus, the answer should be (01012)0000. Now, what about the second question, it asks for the amount of money Freddy spent on phone calls while calling his family members. Freddy spent $5 on 45 minutes of phone call to his Father and $25 on 31 minutes of phone call to brother. What about the other phone calls that he made during the day? Well the calls with Father and the brother are considered as local calls, thus they only had to 3 dollars each while the calls to his friends, family members and so forth were international calls that cost $25 each.", "answer": "A: hair salon"}

But, I just need to make an opinion call on which is best here and I go for laughter. **I think that laughter makes the person happy because it is a way to express the joy that one feels internally.

Provide your reasoning why your response is best.\n\n## Input:\nIn addition, you can use any type of vegetable that you like.\nAnswer: Your answer can be broccoli or vegetable salad. The reason you can use any variety of broccoli is because it is a form of vegetable. If the vegetable of your choice is from another category then you would have to purchase another type of vegetables.\n\n### Input 2\nIn addition, you do not need to use the ingredients in any specific order and if you like, you can use all of the ingredients at once.\n\nAnswer: The reason you do not need to follow the order is because, I know many people that do not care what vegetable goes where. If they like the way the vegetables taste they would put them in there and then leave them. Another good reason is that some people get busy at work or school and just forget where the vegetable is. They just throw it and eat it the next day.\n\n\n## Task 4\n\n### Instructor:\n\nThis task will require you to make a series of selections that allow you to create a scenario using the following instructions.\n\n##### Scenario:\nWhen making macaroni and cheese, you will need to use two cups of whole milk and", "answer": "D: become tired"}

{"text": "### Answer: \nWhy is grooming often suggested for greasy teens?\n* Greasy hair can indicate a lack of cleanliness, making it important to groom.\n* Grooming can help teens feel more confident, which can help their mental health and social interactions.\n* Greasy hair affects mental health due to the physical discomfort of disheveled hair, which reduces self-assurance.\n* Grooming is intended to improve self-confidence.\n* Grooming keeps the hair clean and avoids the use of chemicals or dyes to prevent physical pain.\n\n### Discussion:\n\n### Why is grooming important?\n\n### Other answers:\n* One of the reasons grooming is important for a teenager is because their hair is often very oily and disheveled.\n\n### Hair loss/gain:\nFor the most part, there is no scientific basis for such a loss. However, hair loss is associated with stress or certain medical conditions, such as inadequate blood flow to the scalp. Hair loss is more common in women than men, and there is no evidence to suggest loss is permanent.\n\nHair loss can also be caused by taking certain medications, such as antidepressants and medications used to treat hair loss. Hair loss can also be due to stress, anxiety, or depression. In addition, people going through surgical procedures may experience hair loss. Stress and stressful events can cause hair loss, which is usually temporary.\n\n### Why does having a good personal grooming matter to you?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter to me either way, as I think a good personal grooming is not a problem. I am not sure what it specifically means, and I don\u2019t think it is relevant to me anyway. If this question is about whether you should have a good personal grooming or not, it doesn\u2019t matter to you.\n\nIn general, you should have a good cleaning routine so that your house doesn\u2019t stink or become unclean. You probably care a lot about the bathroom in your house. You care about the bathroom because it is where you take baths. In addition, it is where you wash your teeth, where you put your toothpaste, where you have to wash your hair, where you clean", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}

{"text": "If you were to play a game of pool, you would likely see people in uniform playing the game on a pool table because the ball would move from billiard to billiard. But, in the context of multiple choice question A, the answer is Hole B. What I'm getting at is that when you're a kid, learning, playing and thinking, you have a way that the brain stores information about a subject. For instance, in the question given above, you might say that the answer is correct B because you are told that people play in uniform. Or, you could also say the answer is correct A because you are told that you should see people playing with a ball. The point I am trying to make is that one can have a tendency to select or answer the question incorrectly because you are trying to answer the question \"correctly\" based on what you learn in the process of taking a picture of your learning. This is because your mind wants to take the shortest route around in memorizing something. The second one is a more difficult thing to describe and to grasp, but the second one is the \"longer\" way of remembering something. To get back to the question, yes, you are correct for selecting A, but you are better for selecting B since you have to think about the meaning of it. It doesn't have to be just 2 choices per question. And, there is no right or wrong answer. Just trying to point out the difference in answer selection between the two options and how to get to the answer when trying to choose the correct answer. It takes a lot more work in reading the question to choose the appropriate response.\n\n###", "answer": "E: sporting event"}

One phone call was charged 5 cents, and the rest was charged at a rate of 25 cents. The total cost is the product of the number of minutes and the value of each call. Thus, $0.05 x 45 + $0.25 x 31 = $10.\n\nD. You can use the formula: Total number of hours in the week = 3, number of mondays = 2, and Friday. The number of days in the week = 5. And the number of hours worked on an average day = 8. So Total number of hours worked = 3 + 2 + 5 x 8 = 5 hours.\n\nE.

It is composed of 3 elements. Element #1,the less then or greater than symbol, is used to denote what is to be compared. The element that is to be compared could be a quantity, an expression, or a letter that is used to represent a number. Element #2, the sign, indicates if that element is less then or greater than. Element #3, the element that is to be tested, could be a number, another inequality (which will have its own less then or greater then symbol and may include sub expressions), or an expression.\nLet R be a relation, then R is an inequality if and only if the following three condition are satisfied:\n\n1.If x and y are in R and x is less and y in R, then that implies x<y. Similarly if x and y are in the inequality of R and x is greater then y, that implies x>y.\n2.If x is in R and y is not in R then that implies that < y\n3.If y is not in the inequality R then it is greater or", "answer": "B: need for rest"}

Children learn to count, add and subtract in first grade. Numeration is the starting point for numerical analysis. Egyptians developed the idea of the numeration system around 3000 BCE. There are also different ways of representing a number.\n2. Numbers can be written and explained in different ways. To explain the concept, we use the Hindu-Arabic numeral system.\n3. These are different ways to write and explain numerical values. It used the Arabic-Hindu Numeral Code.\n4.

The most popular mathematics books are for elementary school, where students learn to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers.\n5.

{"text": "The frat boys will enjoy themselves tonight.\n\n### Input-Rationales:\nThe 4 answers are grammatically correct.\n#### A: Do Enjoy.\nTo \"do enjoy\" is syntactically valid and grammatically accurate.\nEnjoy is the simple, present tense form of enjoy, which is a transitive verb that is often followed by the simple present, active participle, or one of the gerund forms, such as enjoying. Here \"to do enjoy\" is grammatically valid.\nAnd enjoy is grammatically complete in and of itself.\nHence, enjoying is grammatically valid and correctly answers the prompt.\n#### B: Get Laid\nGet Laid is grammatically correct because it is a correct verb phrase that describes a situation in which a person or persons consummate or complete sex.\nLay and get are correct transitive verbs that are followed by the simple present participle form, participle, and one of the gerund form of that verb.\nLay does not require an object as it is a verb of motion that can be used to describe actions.\nGet requires that an object be attached to it as it describes acquiring something.\nGet is also followed by a direct object form; it must be a person, place, or thing that you intend to acquire.\nGet Laid is a common example of a verb phrase used to describe a specific situation or event that has taken place.\nA verb phrase is a group of two or more words that function together as a single part of a sentence that carries the grammatical function of a verb.\nTherefore, getting laid is correct verb phrase used to show a completed action.\n\n#### C: Enjoyable\nEnjoyable is grammatically correct as the simple, present participle form (\"enjoyable\"), the present participle form, and the gerund form, such as enjoying are correct.\nEnjoying is a noun that describes the enjoyable state of the active verb \"enjoying.\" It is also common to use enjoyable as an adjective.\nThe enjoyable part of the phrase does not take a preposition such as \"by\" as enjoyment itself is the noun that is the object of the verb \"to do enjoy\" in this prompt.\n#### D: Work Less\nWork Less is grammatically incorrect as it requires a hyphen -.\nWork", "answer": "B: get laid"}

{"text": "If you are driving at high speed, a car in good shape and that is on good tires will have brakes that will be able to stop without too much trouble.\n\n### Inputs:A teacher is giving four tests in a row for 500 students, all of whom are equally likely to flunk each of the tests if they take it. To pass the four tests students must perform at a specific level on at least two of the tests. How many students must pass each test to have a 90% chance that at least 200 will pass all four?\n\n### Response : At least 200 students will pass if: (1) At least ten students pass on at least one of the three tests; (2) At least at least ten students pass the other test (2A).\n\n### Rationale for 1: If less than 10 students pass on one test, there are only 9 tests left to choose from. For a 90% probability, you need at least 14 students to pass on at least one, leaving at least 16 students to pass on the remaining tests, since the probability that a student will pass on a test is at least.15 (1/6) and they all must pass on at least one other test. (This is 16/10 - 8/10 = 10/16 - 1/16 = 8/16 =.5). So any number n > 14 will work.\n\n### Rationales for 2: The students have to pass the two tests left in 2A. With probability.15 (.015 *.15), they have two chances..015 times the probability of passing two tests in a row =.0225. So any students who got all 4 tests are in n*(1-.15) where n > 22.5 to start with. So you can just take the 22.5th power of the number of tests where n > 2. If you find yourself underpowered, just take that number to a higher power, or just divide by the 22.25 and do it another time.\n\n### Choice:\n- B\n\n### Explanation:\n- If you pass 2 or more of the 4", "answer": "C: breaks to help stop"}

{"text": "This is a multiple choice question that tests for understanding of ratios and percentages.\n**Rationales:** The college is adding new science buildings.\n**Explanation:** The ratio of the amount of money the billionaire donated in the original question ($32 million), to the cost of constructing the buildings ($24 millions) is 1: 2 (meaning that the billionaire donated 32/24 = <<32/24=13>>13 times more)!\nAlso, because of this amount, the building will be 32/2 = <<32/7=4.5>>4.5 times bigger than the original one!\n\n### Input:'Randy\u2019s store was robbed. The robber stole a total of $54,456 and put it into two bags. He also stole a $5,000 cash register (it was a part of the 1/3 of the total money). Randy wants to find the robber. He says to his coworker: \u201cIf one of the robber\u2019s bags weighed 6 kg less than the other, she would be able to tell!\u201d How much more was the weight of the first bag?'\n### Rationales: Let x be the weight of the first robber\u2019s bag. This can be modeled by the equation x + $54456 - $5000 = 6 * (x - 2) \n### Explanation: The weight of the first bag is $54459 - $500 = $54959.  To find the weight of the first bags, we add $54450 to the weight of the first band = 6 (first bag weight).  The first bag is 6 times the weight of the second bag (the first bag is larger).  The first bag weight is $54956.  \n\n### Input :If 20% of the amount is cut from the original cost price and the selling price is raised to 100%, then find out the new selling price.

{"text": "A\nRationale: The only way a cat is able to travel outside, or even get away.\n\n################\n\n### Instructed question:  Find the difference between a number that has 1 more than the number of zeros in its units place, and 2 more than the number of digits in its tens place. Explain your reasoning.\n### Solution: The units number has 1 more than its digits, which has two digits because it has two units places.  To get the units number, start with the number and then add a 0 to it until you have one more digit than you have units places.  So 1 + one 0 = 1 * 10 = 10, two digits.  So the units place ends with a ten. To get the tens place, we start on the right and count down to zero. So 2 + two 0 = 2 * 10 =20, 2 units places.  Then we subtract one from 2, so 2 - 1 = 1, which means that there are two units places in the number.  Then we add 1 to the digit and get 2 + 1 = 3 digits.  So the tens place ends with a 3.\n\n\nTo summarize with an example:  To get the units place from our string of 7 1's, we keep adding 0's until we have one more digit than the number of zeros. Thus, 7 + 7 zeros equals 7 + 7 = 14 which ends in 4, where the digits is 012345(start at the right with 5 and subtract 1 from it).  To get the tens place from our string of numbers, we keep counting down on the right until we find the units place.  That way we know that there are two places, so we just subtract 1 from the tens place. Then we get 4 + 1 = 5 tens places.\n\n\n### Instructions:  Answer the following multiple choice question\n### The numbers 800, 761, 891, and 954 have a common difference of two.\n### What is the range of these numbers?\n### Choices:  < 700 < 800 A: True B: False\n### Sol", "answer": "C: need food"}

{"text": "A: Fall asleep\n\n### Input:\"I am going to the movies,\" said Emily.  \"How many tickets do you need for three movies?\"\nRationales: In this question, there are 3 movies.  If you add 3, you get 6 total.  There are two choices\nOne is to divide 6 into two.  If you divide 6 into two, then you get 3/2.  However, it may be more straightforward to subtract the sum of all the movies first: Subtracting the three, you get 3 - 3 = 0.\nThis process may not be applicable to all math problems, but it is a useful tip when it is (like in this word problem).\n\n### Response:\"I will need two tickets.\"\n\n### Input\"To pay a bill of 95 dollars, I wrote a check for $75.00. How much change did I receive in dollars?\"\nRationales:\"To pay a bill of $95 dollars, you subtract the amount you wrote the check for. In this case, it is $75 ($75 - $95 = -20). Therefore, I will get $20 in change. The answer is $75.0\n### Response: \"I received $20 in change\"\n\n### InputWhich number is greater, 4/5 or 6/7?\nRationalesSince 4/5 is less than 6/7, you cannot subtract it from 6/7. 4/5 - 6/7 cannot be an answer to the original question (6/7 - 4/5).\nYou also cannot cancel them because each division is not a whole number.\nTherefore, you cannot do either of these methods of operation.\nSo, for this case, there is not a rational way of finding the answer (4/5 + 5/9)\n### Response:4/5<6/7\n### InputTonight is the opening night of my school's play.

With this extra money he will just pay $1999 and not pay interest at all.", "answer": "A: selling out"}

If in the city a person wants to spend 45 minutes getting to a shopping center 7 miles away driving at an average speed of how much less than 60 miles per hr will it take for them to get there?\n\n### Rationales:\nIf the interstate is 60 miles per 1/2 hour to get to the shopping center is 60/1/2 = 30 minutes. The average speed it took the driver to arrive at the shopping center was 30 minutes/7 miles = 4.29 miles/minute. So the person arrives at a rate of <<4.29 miles>>4.29 miles per minute or, in other words <<4.29mph>>4.29 mph. The city speed which was 45 minutes/7 miles = <<45m/7m=6.57 miles>>6.57 miles took 45 minutes to arrive at the shopper center which, at an average speed of <<6.57mph>>6.57 mph, is <<7/6.57=1.09>>1.09 minutes (instead of 45 minutes).

They are popular because they are cheap to produce and convenient for customers.\nFor example, McDonald's sells the majority of its cheeseburgers in the US as a Happy Meal, which comes with a side of potatoes fried in oil.\n### B)    Vegetable Market\nThe vegetable market is a place where growers and producers bring their crops to sell.\nIt is usually done in a central public place or by appointment to the buyer.\nPotatoes are the second most important food after grain in our diet.\nMany people are familiar with vegetable markets, such as fruits and vegetables.\nThese can be found in almost every town, and are a great place to get fresh produce.\nAlong with potatoes, some vegetable markets might also sell foods related to vegetable farming.\n### C)    Ireland\nPotatoes are very popular in Ireland. The potato harvest is celebrated with Potato Day, a public holiday in several of Ireland's counties.\n### D)    Produce Market\nProduce markets are places where wholesalers and retailers buy food to sell in their stores.\nProduce market managers may have specialized staff to run the business.\nThe produce at produce markets changes daily, so produce buyers need to keep up with what is available as prices change daily too.\n### E)    Dessert\nPotatoes are not just for eating as a side dish. They can also be used as part of a dessert.\nThere are many ways to use potatoes in desserts, and it's easy to find recipes with potatoes as an ingredient.\nPotato pancakes (potato pancakes) can be served as a dessert, with sugar and spices added.\nHowever, you can also find dishes like potato ice cream, which is made by combining an ingredient known as isomalt that replaces sugar in the recipe ingredients.", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

To find how much each girl received, use your ratio:\nThe first number of your ratio is 5; So this would be the number of boys. Divide 140 by 5 to get 28.

How many units of blood could they have produced?\n\n### Rationale:\n95 gives us the total number of people who would have given blood; 2 hrs gives us the length of time in which they gave blood.\nWe can now figure out how much blood they could have produced.\nWe know that 1 hour gives us 1 unit of blood produced, and since 95 gave blood for 2 hrs, 95x2=285 is the amount of time it takes to produce 1 unit of blood\nwe can substitute the units of time into 95x2 to get our number of units of blood to give us blood\n\n95x2= 285\nSince there are 95 people, we need to distribute the blood to each individual\n285/95=3.107 and round down to 3 in decimal form.\n3 in decimal form is equal to 0.03 and the answer is 0.03x285 (because we counted 95 times)\nThis gives us 0.74783.\nFrom here, we want to find the integer portion of 0.74, and then round down to an answer that is an integer.\nTo do this, we have to subtract 0.04", "answer": "C: office"}

If he was moving at 28 miles per hour average for the entire trip, what was the average speed for Rex on the bumpy dirt road?\n### Response Rex had 12 minutes as his time constraint.\n\n### For any given minute, his average speed was 48 miles/hr, as shown by:\n\n```\n[(48+28)^2+(28+28)^3+28^4]=(12*48)^2+((12*28)^3)=1448^2+76656=100347\n```\n\n### If he had an extra minute, then his average speed would have been greater on the bumpy path.\n\n### Example calculation:\n\n```\n(48+40)^2+(40+28)^3=100029\n```\n\nIf we add another minute to this equation, then the average speed over the 3 minute timeframe is:\n\n```\n100028^3+1=100030\n```\n\n## Input: A man who weighs 85 kg wants to we", "answer": "C: being mean"}

Their store pays workers salaries plus an additional percentage of the total sales they make.  During a week, Anna and Brian\u2019s store brought in $13,200.  On the average, Anna earns $330 each week plus 2.6% of the store\u2019s total sales, and Brian earns $300 each week plus 7% of the store\u2019 score, which is the total of every customer\u2019s bill.  How much did Anna earn for the week?  \nRationales:Anna\u2019s salary of $330 per week is her base pay, while she also received 2.6% in bonus; it is not specified what % Brian gets, but for the sake of simplicity let\u2019s assume it to be 6% of total bonuses earned during all previous weeks. Now, it is important to understand that sales figures include only what customers paid at checkout counters; they do not include customer\u2019s discounts and refunds which go against total sales.\n\n\nThis means we have 13200 $S=totalS=totalS+rebateS+discountS\ntotalS=$<<13200+totalS=132+totalS>>13200\n\nFor Anna the total annual earnings is $T=salaryB+bonus+$<<T=salaryB+$bonus+B$>>8\nSalary=S=$<<S=salaryB+B=330+B=334>>330\nBonus=B=$\\begin{split}(2.6\\times T)\\\\ \\text{($13200 average weekly sales}\\\\ =2.6%)\\end{split}$$B=\\frac{13200}{2.6}=5044>>5044 and 80034\\$$\n\nFor Brian, it is much more complicated.

How many large syringes does she have?\n\n### Rationales : The answer comes from the logic of the question. Each large size is 2 syringes, each medium size is 15 syringes, and each small size is also 15 syringe; as you can see, each of the possible 230 numbers has unique factors, so the only possible one is 8 for the medium syringes, the only pair that is left.  It can be concluded then, that there are only four possible pairs left at this point, two of which are the same exact pair (medium). This results in finding the right answer by figuring out what the medium size is.\n#### Large Syringes\n\nAnswer: 2\n\n### Input/Response: A store had a sale every day during the week at a different time.

So, to answer the question, \"How much money is shown?\", do a long-division. Long division involves dividing the numerator, the first amount in the division, by the denominator, the second amount in the division, until no more remainders are produced. If the remainder is 0, the answer is a whole number; 0 if the remainder is 1, the answer is a fraction in simplest form where the denominator is a power of 10 (e.g. 5/6, 5/10, or 15/100). Remember to move the decimal two columns to the right.\n\n**Hint:** The money shown is in coins and bills. Consider the coins first. The first row with 50 pence has 50 pence in it, but it also has 50 p in it. What is 50 divided by 4? 50/4=12+2=14\nWhen you continue the division, you start to see digits getting smaller.

{"text": "The answer is D: shower stall. It is because it is very easy to breed fungus where there is decaying matter like rotten food or rotten toilet seats. You can find milk as rotten food if you go to a zoo and see the animals. This is why you can get sick by drinking milk that is rotten and not cooked. Milk is not a hard nutrient to eat, that is why you need to kill harmful bacteria to prevent the food from being infected, the fungus would feed on the dead bacteria in your body and grow. It is also found in the eyes because if you don\u2019t clean your eyes then it can be infected by fungus.\n\nThe answer is E: decaying matter: When food stays for a longer time or food that we have eaten for more than a day or if the food that we stored in the fridge has reached the expiry date, or if we don\u2019t have any other food source then it is called decaying matter. Because of not much food consumed, you can get sick and then die.\n\nThe answer in D: shower stalls is because when you clean your body it washes off the old dead skin, germs, and it also sweeps away the fungus from your body into the shower stalls. Hence, you will see a big collection of wastewater in shower stalls.\n\n### Answer:  \n### The answer in answer choice D which is the shower stall has to do with the bacteria and you can find the bacteria in eyes.

{"text": "Ink soaked up into paper is a sign of poor penmanship, so it is important that you absorb any excess ink.  One method is to use a fountain pen ink blotter.

This slows down the writing and enables you to write clearly and confidently.\n\n#### Answer: fountain pen inks blotter\n\nInput: How can you easily absorb extra ink after writing with a pen? Choices: A: Absorb the ink then flip the pen. B: Absorb the inks before the pen is used.\n\n### Response\nInk is absorbed into the paper as you write with your fountain pen.  You will notice a small puddle of ink under your writing if you use paper more porous than regular copy paper.  This is the ink being absorbed, and it will continue to ooze out as you write.

The storm destroyed one 4-mile-long main road that the islanders used as their only connection to the mainland.  How long will it take for islanders to construct a new road to replace the old one, if each villager can walk at 3 miles per hour, and this distance on the island is the only possible way to travel from the northern to the southern part of the island?\nRationales:(4+2) miles=<<4+2=6>>6 miles\n1 mile=0.25 miles which makes it 6/(0.25+1)=<<6/(0.2+1)=30>>30 miles\nThe whole island is 4 miles long and there is a 2 mile long gap so it takes 30 miles to cover that (which covers 1/6 of the island) so you need 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5 miles to cover the rest of the island\n#### 15+5=20\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: In the 16th century there were 4 kingdoms each in charge of a different region of the globe.  These kingdoms were the kingdom of Spain, Portugal, and France and the kingdom of England.  The king of Portugal traveled 2,000 miles from Portugal to Spain to visit the king of Portugal\u2019s friend in Spain. The king of Spain would not see the king of Portugal unless he arrived in the southern region of Portugal, which was 1,000 miles away from Madrid, Spain. In which port city was the king of Portugal to arrive?\nRationales:\"Spanish\" is the region the king was in and so if you go from Portugal to Spain that would be 2000 miles which would take 1000 miles from Madrid since there would be 1000 left.\nBut in order for the king to get to the kingdom, he needs to get there in the Southern region of Portugal which is 1000 + 1000/2 = <<1000+1000/1", "answer": "A: burlap sack"}

It tells us to \"write an instruction that appropriately completes... \" which means it should tell us where we can NOT store it.\n\n### Rationales:\nIf it says what we can not do, that means to select every choice aside from the one we are asked to choose. Therefore, we can not put it in a pantry so E is out. Since the instructions say, \"Write an instruction that appropriately,\" we can eliminate the A choices because a container is only an appropriate place to store peanut butter if the other options don't work. Choice B is also out because a supermarket isn't an appropriate place to store the jar since jars aren't sold to the general public in supermarkets.\n\nTherefore, the only options left are C, D, and E. This is where the choice of A over B is important.\n\n### Input where and how will peanut butter need to be stored and how can it be stored in that place?\n\n### Answer:\n- In a pantry. Peanut butter can be stored in a pantry because this is the place where we store jars on shelves. Therefore, peanut butter can go in a pantry. Butter jars cannot be placed in the refrigerator because they do not have a cover and thus they would spoil quickly.\n- In a supermarket. Peanut butters cannot be stored in a supermarket because they are sold only to the general public.\n- In a sandwich shop. PB can't be placed in sandwich shops because they are only found in businesses.\n\n### Exercise :\n- It can be stored\n- In a refrigerator\n- In a plastic jar\n\n### Exercises 2:\n- PB can be stored in a fridge if it is in a plastic jar that will remain airtight even in the cold\n- PB can't.\n- It can't.\n\n### The Exercise 2:\n- It can' t\n- It can's\n- It can be", "answer": "C: pantry"}

That cave did not have a sink, but if it did, that sink would have been referred to as a receptacle.\n\nA sink is not a receptacle. In an area without running water, a receptacle would be a water supply, but that would probably only be a small pool of water.  It would be kept that way to prevent evaporation and to prevent the water from becoming too dirty. A receptacle was an implement to store and/or transport water and any other liquid. In fact, that is where the word \"receptacle\" comes from. A receptacle is any container. In that cave, they must have used any of those, or whatever other containers they could think of.\n\nReceptacle does not describe any of the items that the grandparents would have in their kitchen. In this exercise, the tools that the grandparents used in their kitchen were likely more primitive than what the grandparents\u2019 son and daughter-in-law had in their kitchen. So let us pretend that the grandparents\u2019 kitchen is in the same cave.\n\nReceptacles used in that kind of kitchen would more resemble what we would call a pot rack. It was used to keep the cooking pots from being dropped onto the ground. It was probably also used to hold pot handles so that they would not touch or get in the way.

Each person received a free bottle of water before being admitted to his or her seat. How many bottles of water were used during the event?\n\n### Response\nAnswer: 5430, the number of people who attended the event.\n\n### Explanation:\nTo find the number of bottles, multiply the number of people, 5430 (with a 3 in the exponent to indicate thousands), by the number of bottles each person received before entering, 1.\nYou should be able to check that 5430 * 1 exactly equals 54303 (which, with nothing in the exponent, we read as \"5430 multiplied by 1 equals 543,003\").\n\n### Input  \n  The pizzeria advertised a discount on Wednesdays\u2014a medium pizza  would  be for 25% off.

What percent is it of today, relative to 20 years ago? - - Rationales: The percentage of people living in vehicles has increased from 1% to 4% in the past 10 years.\nBecause Tauca is a country, 1% is 1% of its population while 4% is 4% of its population.

A week in this situation is 7 days. The fee per day is $30. By multiplying both of these figures together, you get a number that is the cost of renting a car for a week, or $210. You can then subtract the cost of this car rental at a car rental facility, which is $210 to get the amount that Jack and Julie need for their car. This is true because you can only pay $210/week if you\u2019re renting a car for less than 7 days at the agency.\n\n#### Answer:You can tell instantly, how much time and $ a week and day at the agency for a week. Multiply the two numbers together to get the total cost, which is $15=<<15=$210>>$210.00.

I will be looking at the businesses of the travel agent, the accountant, and the businessman\u2019s wife.  I will see whether those three lines of work are any good or shady.  Here\u2019s the scenario:\nYou are going on a road trip to Canada and you want to find a travel agent to book your trip.  After you have hired the agent to book your trip, you find out that the agent has lost your passport.  What will you do?  The business of a travel agent is that they help people plan their dream vacation.  A travel agent must be able to use the computer.  That\u2019s because a travel agent needs to get information from the customers about where they want to go and what they want to do on the trip.  When a travel agent is booking a trip, he or she needs to plan for the customer to get the right plane ticket, the right lodging, and the right things to do on the vacation.  A customer can get information about their trip from the travel agent.  It seems like a travel agent can be a good person to talk to about planing vacations.  On the other hand, travel agents can be really expensive.  They would try to get all of the money out of you.  Another bad thing about travel agents is that you don\u2019t have control to cancel or change the plans of the trip that they made for you.\nAn accountant is the one who does your taxes.  That is a person who helps you figure out what items to include on your end of the year tax form.

{"text": "B\n### Instruction Two:\nThere is an integer number x.  It is a value that is not zero and is not positive or negative.  What is a value of x?\n\n### Solution One:\nUse the following rules to determine your answer:\n\nRule 1: Add 0 to the last digit of x until it becomes 0, and subtract it from x.\n\nIf x ends in 1 or 2 (for example 10 and 11) add 1 to x until it becomes 1 or 2, and subtract that from x.\n\n*Example:*\nLet x=543\nStep 1: Add 1 to the last 2 digits; 5432 Step 2: Subtract the 2 from x; (432) \u2013 (543) = -111\n\nSo using Rule 1:\n(543 \u2013 111) = 432 and 432 + 1 = 433\n\nIn summary, -111 in base 10 is represented by 7 in base 2. In base 10, the number we had to add to x to convert it to base 2 was 7, so (432 \u2013 7) = 425\n\nRule 2: In order to add 0 to the last number of a number, convert that number to a base that will result in a 0.\n\n*Example*: To convert 10 to base 2, you have to convert 10 to 100, that is 1*100 + 0*1+0 = 1+0 = 0 in base 2. To convert 100 in base 10 to base b, you have to divide each digit by b, where 0 is the denominator.  For example, since 10 is base 10, divide each digit by 10, and then convert the remainder to 0 base.  For example, divide 10/10 = 1 remainder 0.

Rationales: Given the choices, this question is asking about solids and liquids. Solids don't freeze.\n\n### Rationales\n\n### Input B: melting\n\n### Response B. Melting. Rationales: Because of water's high specific heat we are most likely talking about a solid. If this is the answer to a question about liquids, we need to think about things other than solidification and melting.\n\n### The answer is D. Getting cold.\n\n### This can easily be determined based on the information provided by the instructions and the example. I will break this answer into two main points. 1) We have \"wet\" as an object to focus on. 2) We have \"cold\" as an adjective to focus on.\n\nWe are told that the ground is getting wet (adjective) and that this information (wet ground) should give us clues of what is happening near us (the noun). From this phrasing, this question is asking us about wetness. So to get an answer we need to think about the verb, \"get.\"\n\nWetness is only an adjective of ground. That means \"get\" here is really in the phrase \"get wet.\"\n\nSo wetness of the ground is most likely to freeze near us (the verb again).\n\nSo we have \"wet,\" \"get,\" and cold as our objects to focus on for this task, leading us to answer \"getting cold,\"\n\n### Rationale\n\n### How can I use these techniques and strategies with more complicated questions? How can I use these strategies more effectively when I have enough time and opportunity for them to work smoothly, but not when I have very little time? When can I use these techniques together, when can I use them separately.\n\n### I think I can start planning out my work using these strategies.

The sum of the second and fourth numbers was $17. So we can write:\n```\n18 = 9 + 8.3                          \n17 = 8.3 + 8.7                        \n```\nIf we subtract these two equations, we get $18.0 - $17.3 = $0.7.\nSimilarly, if we substract the second equation from the first we get $17 - $18.0 = -$0.1.\nAdding two different equations yields the same result. So,\n```\n$18.0 - ($18.0 -$0.1 - $0.7) = $0    \n$18.1 - $0 = $18.1                    \n```\nThus, $18.0 + $17.3 + $0.7 + $0.1 = $18.0, and the sum of the first and second numbers is $17.3.

It rained 8 days during a 10-day period and 4 cows died. There were 27 cows the day after the rain stopped. How many days did it rain?\n\n### Response :The rain stopped on day 5.\n\n### Justification : There were 53 cows on the field and they died at the rate of 1/5th or 1 cow/day.  Thus, on the day it rained, 4/5 or 8/5 or 8 2/5 = 1.6 cows died.  One cow died for each day the rain fell.  Thus 4 cows died because of the rain.  (4 cows died / 8 days of rain which is 50%)\n\nAlso, since it rained 8 days, they were 2 days left without rain.  After 2 days the farm decided to count the rest of the cows that survived the rain.  Thus, (53-4) = 49 were left.  The rain was stopping. There were 2/5 or 16/25 = 6.4 cows gone.

{"text": "E.\n\n#### The answer is E\n\nInput:Different companies manufacture batteries that can be used for cell phones.  When they are manufactured, each battery is tested to check that it has enough charge.  A company that makes batteries sells them if the charge is at least 300 milliamps.  However since batteries lose charge over time, they also sell batteries with less charge.  One battery tester produces readings according to a normal distribution.  A reading of 800 milliamps indicates a full battery.  Other less capable batteries have a reading of less than 700 miliamps.  If the standard deviation is 120 miliamps, what percentage of batteries will have a capacity of greater than 300 miliamps?\n\nRationales:\n\nIn a normal distribution if the standard deviation is 500 = 0.134 the mean is 5000 = 0 and the median is 0 so let it be 0.55. Now we know what we are looking for.

So I will improve them and provide some advice here.\n\n### I-3\n- 20 complete tripes will take 20 times 2 = <<20*2=>40>>40 \n- So there's a slight issue with the 40, and \n- 500-300 = <<500-390=110>>110 error was because it wasn't multiplied by \n  `14`. We can change this to `400-30=400*14=` which makes it `560` (if you read the previous line out to yourselves you can see we need to subtract `14` times the original number to get what we want).\n\n### I1\n- 20*1 = <<20*1=2>>\n- (24-14)/14 = <<(24-14)divide by 14=5/14>>5\n- Change to `24*14/` (You just need to do what is the same as dividing it by 14, instead of diving by 14). The answer will still work out the same. You can see in this example there is a lot of maths to do, so I'm going to do something different.\n\n### II16\n- (Less 20 = 20*1/2) = <<less 20 means 20 less = 20(1/2)>>\n- (Plus 20 = 60* 1/2) = <<plus 20 means 60 more than 20 = 120*1/3>>\n- (60 more or less) / 24 = <-60*1/3-20=33/24>\n- So it can't work without 24.\n- The correct answer is 33 as it is less than 36", "answer": "B: cemetary"}

All of the city's residents are evacuating.  They are each going to be asked to spend 3 hours driving 3 hours to a location where they can evacuate further to higher ground.  How long, in hours, will it take to evacuate all citizens?\n\n### Rationale\n\nI guess that the order of how everyone evacuates doesnt matter to the problem so I just need to find the number of cars that can travel at a time to get the final number. There are 3 hours in a day so I subtract that from the 6 hours to arrive at 3 hours as the evac rate which means that everyone can leave in one day. After that problem is solved, I need to find the time that each car needs to travel. With 3 hours, there is still a wait of 3 hours. However, when there are 3 cars, 1 car is still waiting but when there are 5 cars, no wait can occur. This shows that the waiting time is not an exponential function but rather a linear function. As a result, each car travels for 3 hours to come to that point. So, the total time in each day is the number of hours that elapsed that day*0 (because no car was left on a waiting list) divided by the number of hours per car. This gives me a total of 3/3 = <<3/3=1>>1. Therefore, the time is only the time spent on the roads for cars and that is 6 hours.\n### Solving it, I get 1/3 of a day = <<1/3=0.33>>0.33 days or 3 3/4 = <<3+3/4=0.75>>0.75 of a day.\n### Rationale 2:\n\nThe average speed that I get is (3+", "answer": "E: house"}

They tried to save their business by giving customers a 7% discount on all meals.   The next week, they lost 3% of their profits.

When they lost 3% they made a 17% loss of profit.  The 7% was given and 3% lost means that is 3% of original profit.  Let x = original profit y = initial profit after the 7% discount z = lost profit that week So 17% of x = y+z 0.17(x) = y+z  y-z = 0.17x-0.17x 0.017x+0.17 = 0 0x+0.167x = 0.167 0x-x = 0.067 0 = x - x = 0  x= x = x  So x-x = 0(3%)+10\n#### 7\nAnswer: 7\n\n### Input 1\nThe company received $2182.87 in profits after paying all business taxes.

Earth is a planet.\n\n### Input :A: Pacific C: None of these\n\n### Demolition:\nInput: A company that specializes in demolishing buildings has been hired to dismantle a building that is scheduled to be replaced by a new building. There are 6 offices on the main flour and a total of 24 offices on the second level. There is a freight elevator and passenger elevator that both service each story. The demolition company has requested a list of the numbers for all of the offices in order to make a list of tenants to inform of the building's demolition. Write a function that takes a list of numbers (the list of office numbers) and return a list that contains the numbers of the offices on each floor. For example, [3,5,6,8] returns [[3,5],[6,8]] and [5,3,8,7] returns [[3,7],[5]]\nRationales: For an example of only the main floor offices, if there are 6 in total, this is equivalent to 1 2 3 4 5 6\nA 2-dimensional array with 1 row and 6 elements, would be [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]\nThis results in [[3 4] [5 6]]\nOr a list of the office numbers on the main floor would be [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n\nNow, If there are 6 offices in total on the main floor and there are 24 offices in total, these 24 offices can be separated into different combinations based on the main floor offices, and the total number of floors.\nFor example, using 6 offices on the first floor and 24 offices in all, the only unique 2nd floor office combinations would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], but also, [2, 3,4,5], [3, 4,5], and [4, 5]. These are all unique permutations so their product is 6*6*6\n\nSimilarly, using 1 2 6 on the first floor and the same 24 options, you have a total of 12 unique possibilities, but each", "answer": "D: earth"}

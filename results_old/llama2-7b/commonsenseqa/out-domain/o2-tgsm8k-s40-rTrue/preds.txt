The second part of the statement - 'I got it from this supermarket' is also not helpful. Where is the supermarket? The answer cannot be given without the context of the sentences. The answer must say the location.<n><n>### Counter Argument<n>Why do you say I'm not technical. I can understand code in English too (not in Japanese :D). Please tell me what English sentence I can use to understand this code in English.<n><n>### Rationale (Why do you say the answer can't be given without the context)<n>I guess you are thinking, "The answer cannot be given without a code, so you must be technical."<n>But in this case, you don't need code to answer the question.

We know that the formula for weight is mg, in which m is mass and g is an acceleration. If a baseball was dropped from a window at 8 meters per second, it would not weigh 9.8 newtons per square meter, since it was in motion at such a great speed. It would have a force of 9.8 (9.8 is the acceleration due to gravity) meters/square second because of its mass.  Is this correct?<n><n>###

This restaurant no longer exists, so Samantha hired eight new chefs. The chefs cooked 240 meals during the next month. These meals were cooked for four weddings. What percentage of the hired chefs help cater weddings?<n><n>**Rationales:** Samantha bought 1,604 meals and cooked 242 meals for four weddings, giving her 1,602 to sell. So we can subtract the 240 meal total from Samantha's total of 1,607. So her total was 1,608 and she has only hired eight chefs, so that leaves her with 1,601 which was what she hired eight chefs to be able to sell.<n><n>**So now we have the remaining total of 1,007 meals to divide with eight chefs.<n>**Since there are 1000, we can divide the meals by the number of chefs and get 125.<n><n><n>**Answer:** 125%<n><n>### Question : 2.

Choices:  A: the roof B: storage cabinet C: car trunk D: retail store E: home<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Rationales:<n>#### Shopping Bag Goes on the Car Trunk<n><n>If you put a shopping bag in the seat of the vehicle, there is not enough space.<n>The driver needs to be able to seat without being disturbed.<n>If you put a handbag on the roof of your car, you might risk breaking the car.<n>The only place left in your car is your trunk, unless you're willing to drive with items in laps and on your feet.<n>The trunk is the only space where you'll not put anything at risk, like your car.<n><n>#### A shopping bag goes in the car Trunk<n><n>Rationales for response: The only place where you can store a shopping bag without putting anything at risk is your car's trunk. Drivers should stow their shopping bags in the car's trunk instead of carrying them in their laps or on their feet because doing so endangers your vehicle and yourself. Shopping bags must go in the trunk.<n><n>#### Driving with shopping bags<n><n>Rationales Shopping bags should not be placed in the trunk. A shopping bag should not be stowed in the trunk because of the risks of a collision or damage to the vehicle in case the car has to come to a hard stop or a sudden turn. A shopping bag needs to be stored on the floor in front of all the sitting passengers. An occupant in a vehicle in the trunk has a higher probability of fatality in the event of an accident and they cannot be treated for injuries. Instead of a bag, one should carry a handbag or a small bag.<n><n>#### Shopping Bag storage in the trunk<n><n>Rational for response:<n>Shopping bags should not go in the trunk because doing so presents risk to both the driver and the car. The car's back end will most certainly get damaged if the trunk is full. Furthermore, if the car were to stop abruptly or turn quickly, an object in the trunk that is not secured can impale the occupants or roll about and cause harm. To keep the car healthy and the passengers safe, shopping bags should be kept in the trunk as little as possible. It is preferable if passengers transport their belongings and keep them in handbags or small purses.<n>

This is because it deviates you from doing what you should which is study. A boring class makes people talk.<n><n>### Input<n>C++ is a popular programming language that enables you to create software applications. It is used to create software for operating systems and other applications. The programmers use specific features of the language in order to solve real-life problems by defining algorithms to manage variables that can be manipulated, which has a strong base of built-in functions. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. It is an object-oriented programming language. The syntax of C++ is based on C. A lot of computer science majors are required to take this course while other major programs use it for their application development needs such as data analytics or data science projects at the university, etc.<n><n>### Output:<n>C++ is a simple language designed to allow programmers to write portable code. It supports object-oriented features, including class definition, inheritance, and polymorphism in addition to being fast and efficient, making it one of the most widely used languages today for development and deployment in industry.<n><n>### Demo answer<n>I find C++ to be an excellent choice for any situation, including computer programming and other applications. The language offers a variety of features including a modern syntax, which provides clear code structure with clean lines. In particular, the class definition along with its inheritance properties ensures any programmer has the flexibility to write efficient code without sacrificing its readability; this is one of my favorite features!<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: board ship B: shout at C: smile at D: cross street E: feel happy<n><n>### Response:		C or a mix of C and B<n><n>### Why:B,C,D, and E are all methods how to get a person's attention, but they are done in pairs. So the method to get attention should combine both the method "to smile at the person" and "shouting" since shouting alone will not be enough to make people aware of ones existence.<n><n>### Input:: A computer in a shop plays a lottery game. During the play, a ball is dropped from a height into a lottery drum. Let the ball be named B. Let's assume that in some 1000 ＂Ball drawings, there are 120 balls that are A, 45 balls that are B, and 45 balls that ＂were neither A nor B＂. Determine the number of Bs in 5 balls. For example, an input of 50, 000 might result in the outcome 1, 500,.

Therefore, the outcome is 1600*(1/120)=150 <n><n>### Input:'A' stands for a, 'B' stands for b, 'C' stands for c, 'D' stands for d, 'E' stands for e, and 'F' stands for f. Choices: A: bcd F: ed B: ecf A: f d C: bce<n><n>### Response:'E', 'F', and 'C' have all only C letters, therefore they have to be the right choice. But 'A' and 'C' both have both a and f, and 'A' have both b and d. In short, 'A' has both c and d, while 'C' has both c and f. So the choice is between 'C' and 'F', and choosing 'C'

Choices:  A: home B: hardware store C: home D: hot room E: office<n><n>### Response:		The answer choices only vary based on the way one might define 'electric fan'. One could say that this is not a literal electric fan, but rather a fan as a unit (and thus can be used more than once) or that this is a figurative electric fan. The correct answer is that one could have more than one electric FAN in their HOME.<n><n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>There are two separate ways in which to think about an electric fan, based on one's individual definition. If one believes that an electric fan is a physical thing that must have a separate space in a physical location, then they could only have one electric fan in their home but could have multiple fans as a unit (i.e. one can have a ceiling fan, box fan and pedestal fan in any number of rooms in their home). However, if one believes that an "electric fan" is a figurative description, one could have multiple units of electric fans at any one space, i.e. multiple ceiling fans, box fans and pedestal fans in one single room of their home.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: sneezing B: fatigue C: house clean D: feeling satisfied E: getting good grades<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>####  A<n>Answer: A<n><n>### Input :The school is conducting a survey on what type of candy they should sell. They ask a group of students whether they prefer chocolate, peach, or grape. The response categories are: A- yes, B- maybe, and C- no. All responses are counted.  The results are: 23% say yes, 20% say maybe, and 57% say no. The percentage of survey respondents who had this option they said they preferred. Choices A: chocolate B: Peach C: Grape D: Either<n><n>### Response : A<n><n>####  A <n>Answers: A<n><n>## Instructions:Please respond to a colleagues comment and provide reasoning where appropriate.<n><n>### Response1:I agree with you that the first scenario is easier to solve and the only thing that needs to be done is to subtract 45 from the answer. The second scenario is different since we are given with the difference between the sum of the Doberman Puppies and the Schnauzer. Now, you add to that a constant of 90. The thing that makes the problem difficult is that the Schnauzers do not change so they are the same number over the given span of six months. Therefore, it is more important to understand the difference between 55 and 35. The first half of your explanation is well thought out and very easy to grasp. In the second part of your explanation, you assume that the number of Schnauer changes from start to end of the given 6 months. However, that is not the case and does not make sense at all. Since no other variable changes, it is best to assume that the Schnauzer count remains the same throughout the given span. You are correct to determine the required subtraction to add the 90 to the answer. It is important to note that the Schnauze number does not change and therefore, a given number of 60 needs to be appended. Lastly, you need to note that the additional variable in the question is the number of Dobermans. With that being said, it is best to subtract 45 to provide the correct answer of 35.<n><n><n>#### 1 A<n><n># 1 A<n>#### 2<n><n>#2:

Choices:  A: brown hair B: names C: two eyes D: will E: brains<n><n>### Response:		C!  "Two eyes" is a "shared" trait that people in the same family usually share.<n><n>### Rationale <n>A,B,C,E will not apply. If people share hair or DNA, it's an inherited trait. If they have the same names, it's a coincidence. If they share brains, it's implied that they're siblings, and they don't have to answer the question. The only answer that applies to a family is siblings: parents are not members of a family, and no one inherits from great-great-great-greater-grandparents. (This is just a rule I made up, but it's right most of the time. The only exceptions are when you have adopted brothers and sisters, but they aren't necessarily blood relatives.)<n>

So a football field is a place for a football game. It is a huge field with a line between each team. I think this question is asking what can go on a football playing field, so university is probably talking about a football player, college is talking about colleges, and campus is talking about all of the students or the colleges, so C is probably what they are asking. A is talking about Oklahoma, but it is not a player, B is talking about school, but it is not on the field, D is probably talking about the players, and E was probably a student, so it makes no sense. So I think the answer is B: university<n><n>## D.A.R.E<n><n>### Question:What do you do at a job interview?

At its inception, the dollar was based upon the value of gold and was valued at 16 to 1, or $4.8625 per ounce. When the nation entered into a trade dispute with England, the value of these dollars was questioned by the government of England, who claimed that U.S. dollars were equivalent to 90% less a pound of sterling silver (24.5 carats). As such, these paper dollars had to be exchanged for actual silver coins (89% of an ounce) equal to the value of 9/10 a pound sterling. To make this easier to figure out, Congress used a one-pound sterling silver coin called a milled dollar instead of using a half-pound sterling coin so that the exchange rate could more easily be calculated. The milled dollar was in use at about $3 and 45/100 cents from 1805 to the time of the Civil War when the United States was 16 years old. What would it have cost you to buy a 1-pound sterling gold coin weighing about 250 grams for the face value of £14.68? In addition, the Treasury Department had to print gold coinage which was worth more than its stated value. What would that 1-pound gold coin be worth?<n><n>### Response Question:<n>The dollar was valued at 9/10 pounds of sterling silver. This was an exchange rate of around $.45 a pound sterling, which would be 24.5 carat silver. The weight of 9 pounds of gold was $42.5.<n><n>### Rationale Question:<n>A) The government had to exchange a sterling pound for more money than what the government actually printed. This meant that each of these dollars would be

Choices:  A: allergic reaction B: gain weight C: have fun D: heartburn E: food poisoning<n><n>### Response:		<n>When you eat hamburgers all the time you will not usually have food poisoning, but you never know if you will gain weight. If you gain weight, then you will obviously have difficulty in fitting into your clothes. If you eat hamburger all the time, you might develop an allergy to that food. Allergic reaction will not happen unless you are eating a hamburger from someone you don't know that normally you eat a hamburger.<n><n>When you eat hartburt you feel funny in the pit of your stomach. Usually heart burn will not happen when you eat a hambuer from who you don't know.<n><n>I think that when you don't know from whom you get your hamburger from, then you might have food poiunsing. I think that most of you know the difference.<n><n>When you don't know the person who give you the hamburger, you will normally have a heartburn. I don't think there is any difference in the symptms caused.<n><n>Answer: In some situations, allergic reactions from food poisoning can be mistaken or misdiagnosed. In rare cases, the most common symptoms of food poisoning are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, or even nausea and headache. So, the difference between allergies and food poisoning symptoms is really that you usually have these symptoms because of food you usually have.<n><n>I think "eat hamburgers" can also be a verb for "eat food that is made of pork" and not just that of beef that the food looks like pork. So, if you eat a hamburgers made of pork from who you don'tt know, then you will probably have either food poisoning or an allergy that you didn't have before.<n><n>Hunger can be a factor for eating something even if the taste doesn't want to satisfy us. I just think sometimes we eat something because it's the only thing available when we are in a hurry to eat something, or sometimes when we are hungry. Like at a school canteen the food can contain peanuts and sometimes there is no another choice available. If that happen to a student that has a peanut allergy, the student usually don't eat that food and that could cause food poisoning

Her co-worker, Betsy, is a manager of the Receiving Department.  According to Margot, "It takes ten minutes to unpack a box of merchandise and put it on the shelf. I can work this fast, even when I'm sick or I haven't had breakfast yet." Making Everything Easy's computer system automatically records the time that a box of merchandisewas unpacked. Margot thinks that if she could work 12 boxes a day, she could unpack each box faster than Betsy. "I can unpack 12 boxes if I work fast, and if I work 9 hours each day, it still takes only 3 minutes extra for each box. I can make up this tiny extra time by being efficient. That's why I'm working 12 boxes each day," she says. Betsy's unpacking time is 99 seconds per box. The Sales and Service Department's workday is 8 am to 4 pm. What will the time be, in minutes, when Margot finishes unpacking 128 boxes in a day?<n><n>### Rationale: According to Margot, the time to unpack a box is ten minutes if she works hard enough, even if she hadn't eaten yet.<n>If margot is working 12 boxes of merchandise each day, it would take her 20 x minutes to unpack and if she was working 9 hours per day, it would be 9 x minutes. That is 3 times as much time to unpack 128 boxes each day.<n>#### 20 x + 9 x<n><n>The answer is: 3minutes.

Choices:  A: make B: raise C: entice D: build E: fix<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Rationale:Raising implies lifting something high or making the object bigger. We did not give the building a lift nor did we make anything bigger. We did fix it and that can also raise a home because it allows the room to have more windows. Since the action is about destroying and not raising, the choice is not 'B'. 'C' is not correct because enticing has something to do with the building itself, we did not entice our new barn from a place, the action was to destroy our old barn and we don't entice anything because that would be 'E' the choice. 'D' is incorrect because building is a verb that deals with making something bigger such as 'building our home a bigger one.'<n><n><n>### Instructions:<n>Input:<n>Rewrite these sentences, changing the bold letters as indicated in light type. <n>Sentences<n>We were at a ____ with lots of friends.<n>That was the best meal I've ever eaten in a ____!!<n>We're having a ____ with your cousins tonight.<n>What a ____ that place is.<n>I'll be sure to call you.<n>I can't wait to see you again.<n>#### <n>Answer:<n>We were at a party with lots of friends.

Choices:  A: body of water B: lake superior C: underwater D: toilet E: aquarium<n><n>### Response:		<n>This is a multiple choice question with choice A for the majority of the time fish spend their time in the body of water.<n><n>### Inputs and outputs:<n><n>Input:Fred, who was a police officer, was very careful with his work. He did not like to leave evidence lying around. But one day he had to put a body in a freezer to keep him from disintegrating. Fred put the body in the freezer and locked the door. The next day, however, Fred accidentally left the freezer on and by the time he remembered it was on, the body was all liquid, even though it had only been on for an hour. As a result, Fred had to clean up the freezer. The next day Fred began putting his evidence into an even smaller freezer where he would also be able to fit the big body. He found that every time he had to empty the first freezer, he put a lot of evidence into the second. He said to himself: "The next day will be busy".<n>Rationales:<n>This is a story problem that requires two steps to solve. The first step is to figure out the evidence in the first freezer. Step 1: Fred did not like leaving evidence lying around. Step 2: Every time Fred emptied the first freezer, the second freezer was also filled. At least there would be twice as much evidence in the second freezer.  Thus, the second freezer must hold more than just one piece of evidence.<n>Let's say there are 100 pieces of evidence in the first freezers. Step 1: There would be at least 200 evidence in the second freezers (100 + 200 = 300)<n>Step 2: When Fred empties one freezer, the other freezer also gets the pieces of evidence:<n>200 / 2 = 100 in second freezers.<n>There remains, by least 100 evidence left in the first freezner.<n>#### 100<n>Answer: 100<n><n>Input:Dave had ten marbles. He lost two marbles. He then gave five marbles to his son. What did he have left? Choices:A. 6 marbles B. 8 marbles C. 11 marbles D. 23 marbles E.

Gold may be a great investment, but it is not gold that is the reserve so A is out.<n>*B. the actual Strategic Gold Reserve is held by Fort Knox. This is a storage site for the gold kept in foreign nations. This gold is kept outside the United States. This is not the correct answer.<n>*C. Treasure chests are a great place to keep gold, but are not held by the government in the United States. Therefore, C is out.<n>*D. This is a great guess. The U.S. Gold Reserves are in the Fort Knox and this is held by the U.S. Treasury. This is a storage place for gold so the answer is D.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Since the first question asked where the reserves were stored but provided no information regarding the quantity stored, we are left with a few options to consider. <n><n>Let's use Fort Knox as an example to show how the logic is built.<n><n>* Fort Knox does not store the Strategic Gold Reserve but holds the Reserves of foreign nations<n>* Treasure Chests do not exist anymore at all<n>* If a gold bullion is on hand outside of the United States, then the question is answered<n><n>Due to the way the last option was worded, the first option is eliminated (since Fort Knox does not, in fact, contain the U.S. Strategic Gold Reserve). We then assume that the U.S. Gold Reserve is in fact stored outside the U.S. To determine this, Fort Knox' answer of option C is eliminated because gold is not stored in the treasure chest which seems to be a logical conclusion to many test-takers. This leaves us with the second and third option, since Fort Knox does not contain the Strategic Gold Reserves and the treasure chest has been eliminated as a possible storing location for gold. The third and last option still has a strong, reasonable logical assumption that gold would be kept at Fort Knox since this can no longer be considered since the second option has been eliminated. This leaves us with Fort Knox containing the Strategic

Where might he keep it? Choices:  A: shelf B: place of work C: desk D: office supply store E: school<n><n>### Response:		 A: shelves on a desk at his place of work<n><n>### Explanation: James doesn't use the term desk. The author doesn't state the exact area where James stored his clipboard on his desk. It could be any of the areas that the author doesn't specify.<n>The author refers to James' desk, not to his entire work place and he doesn't name a specific room, and he doesn't mention an exact place that James could easily find his clipboard. He doesn't indicate that he can find it at his workplace, at workstations, or at his office, either.<n><n>### Input The author wrote:  The author wrote:  "What if I’d told you I had the best seat in town?” What did the author of this sentence know that you didn’t?"<n><n>### Response The author knows who asked the question.<n><n>## Difficulty:<n>This question is moderately difficult.<n>A moderate level of cognitive engagement is required which includes the understanding of multiple sentence level features. For instance, the question refers to "the author", a pronoun which can be confusing. In addition, "what if I'd told" is an expression. For this reason, "what if" refers to different words which are the product of a grammatical process, and can be confusing.<n>There is some ambiguity in the question. When answering the question, the meaning the question is referring to should be determined so as to determine the correct response. If this is incorrect, the response will be wrong.<n><n>## Construct:<n>There is a task-based construct. This is a task based instruction, that requires a response. There is a statement that describes some tasks, and a response that should accomplish those tasks.<n><n>## Authoring information:<n>This assessment template was created by Margarita Dikson, PhD.  This question was written by Margarita Dzikus.<n>She reviewed it with J.K. Pantzis, PhD. for the purposes of ensuring that the material presented was relevant and accurate.<n><n>## Assessment:<n>This assessment will score the response and give feedback. The scoring and feedback may be automated or manual. The scoring criteria and feedback should also be published.

My next paycheck was three  weeks away. How much will I need to borrow in order  to get out of the library with my full book pile?<n><n>### Input<n>After much consideration, I decided to bring a full book pile. So, I borrowed 10 books (I'll bring one book with me each week) that cost $.52 a piece.<n>I also brought along a $10 deposit. This allowed me to check out  any book I wanted. If I had known, I would have just  bought the 10 books, so my total cost for the 10 would  have only cost me $5.10.<n><n>### Rationale<n>To check out a book, you would leave a $10 depositing, and use your $10 to check out the books.<n>Therefore, to bring a full pile of books, you would need to check out 10 books. The costs for these would be 10*$.52 = <<10*.52=5.10>>5.10<n><n>### If the deposit has already been given, then check out 10 would be the cost, and $10.52 is the total cost. If the deposit hadn't been given, then you could just buy  10 books, which would cost $5.10, but this is assuming you would have any money left.<n><n>#### 5.10<n>Answer: 5.10

If you look at the fraction, there is a five over the line of the fraction, so you have 238/10. We are going to convert this to fractions of ten, by dividing each part by 10. When you do this is going to equal one twenty-eight over one hundred. This is going to create a 128 over one hundred, which is going to create the fraction 238/ 10. When this is equal to the fraction 2.38, or 238 divided by 10.<n><n>### Support  : Your answer is one twenty-eight divided by one hundred. After you divide this, it turns into 128 divided by 1,000. This works out to be 238/33 which is equivalent to 238 divided 10.06

An additional 36 feet of rope will be required to build the tent.  If the tent's frame's cross-section is 7 inches square, can the club afford the tent?<n><n>### Rationales:The tent's cross-sectional area, the 7 inch square, is equal to 7*7 = 49 square inches.

They had 85, I then added together 21 and 26 which equals 47 which would fall under the umbrella of the usa. I then would add what was left and get 18 and that’s the number of apples an apple in a tree not in ohio or alaska would be an imported product. <n>#### 18<n>Answer: Florida<n><n>### Input for:The United States imported $75,700,000 worth of apples from China.<n>Those are not my 2 choices I didn’t know that the US imported apples from China so I guess that’s what I would go do is go ahead and say that I only have the US that are available to me.<n>The first part of the question says that the Unites States imported $75 million dollars worth of apples, those were 98 of my choices and I knew we didn't import any from the choices the United States imported $70 million in Canada, the United states imported $25 million worth of apples from Mexico, and we imported 50 million from California.<n>I knew that Canada and Mexico were off limits and we didn’t import apples from China, so I knew that apples were imported from California, I used the equation 75+25 to get 100.<n>I rounded it up to 100 and I did the same thing for the 50, I got 150 so now I’ve got an equation 75+100+50=300.<n>When doing this I got a value of 328 which was not an option of mine.<n>So what I would do is go ahead and I would take that subtract out the United States which equals 228.<n>If I go on from there and take a look at apples imported by all of the countries that I have 300 minus 228 which equals 72.<n>The 228 that I started with if I add the apples that China, China apples, I ended up with 200 that’s 10 less than what was available to me, so I know that my answer can’

How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>### Input:Where is a monkey likely to be found in the rainforest? Choices:  A: tree tops B: rain forest C: zoological gardens D: great outdoors E: zoo<n><n>### Response:		B - rain forest<n><n>### Rationales: A would be a tree. B is rainforest. C would be a zoo. D would be a great outdoor. E would be a zoo.<n><n>### A would be a tree<n><n>### Rationale: "Monkeys are tropical or subtropical animals (except the two species of cold-adapted ones that live in caves), living naturally only in rainforests."<n><n>### E would be a zoo<n><n>### Rationale: "Monkeys are known collectively as primates."<n><n>### B would be rain forest<n><n>## B would be rain forest - "Primates (monkeys, apes, gorillas, and lemurs) live in a variety of habitats across Asia, Africa, and South America. Most live in tropical rainforests but a few species (such as marmosets and capuchins) live in savanna or shrubland habitats. Some (such as spider monkeys in the South American tropics) are adapted by having prehensile tails that allow them to use their arms to help them cling to branches. All wild primates live in social groups. Humans are the only species of ape which has been fully domesticated by humans and can become tame."<n><n>### C would be a zoo - "There are over 400 types of primates in the world, including monkeys, macaques, gorillas, baboons, lemurs and more."<n><n>### D would be a great wide open area - "A number of primates are found in the tropics, such as the orangutan, chimpanzee, and gorilla."<n><n>### There are several species of monkeys known as mangabeys, each of which is found in a different country, but only the Allochrocebus cupreus species is known to live in zoos. So "zoo" or "(zoological) garden" makes no sense here.<n><n>

Each number is associated with a dollar amount where the dollars are associated with the value of each number. What is your maximum potential profit without taking any bets?<n>### Demonstation:<n>Say, for example, 1 = 1 cent and 10 = $1, 10 is twice as much as 5 which is one dollar. This means that 5 dollars will profit you 5 cents <n>For each of the above example you start with 5 cents and $0.50. Each bet you take increases by the number of bajillions. Bazillion is defined as ten thousand to the power infinity. In the example you start with $0.50 and ten times that is $10, then you take that amount and raise it by 10 times again which is $100. Now every time you take a bet, it increases by $100 and you make $100, the most amount of money.<n>Input: Find the maximum profit by taking bets on the odd-digit positions of a number line

And as soon as you’re finished and leave the store, you are in many ways using a product made through some sorts of manufacturing: as grocery store products like canned soup and frozen ice cream involve many processes to produce (cleaning, cooking, freezing, canning), a person would consider grocery store a spot for manufacturing.<n><n>#### Option D<n><n>-	Most aircraft are made on assembly lines, but the process requires specialized assembly, including welding, which does not fit human expectations for manufacturing.<n>-	An aircraft requires significant specialized manufacturing processes, so one would not consider this a manufacturing process in a grocery store.<n>-	Many aircraft are built in factories, but this is clearly the exception. The answer to the question of where a human would expect to find manufacturing is an on-going activity with a product that a human can identify and interact with. The aircraft would have to be made by people who either have an unusual amount of spare time or some sort of unusual, almost industrial, assembly.<n><n>#### Option A<n><n>-	Factories. Factories are buildings where things are made. These buildings are large and often produce different types of things. People work in factories and produce things.<n><n>#### Option B<n><n>-	Schools. The classroom is a place where we teach and create knowledge. This is the perfect location for people to learn and create. You could think of it as a factory where knowledge is being created!<n><n>#### Option E<n><n>-	In most schools, there is a cafeteria that offers meals and snacks. These meals and snacks are typically prepared by people who work in the cafeteria.<n><n>#### Option F<n><n>-	People usually expect to find manufacturing in schools, especially in the library.<n><n>### 1<n><n>### 2<n><n>### 3<n><n>### 4<n><n>### 5<n><n>### 6

This response is correct. Mark wasn't asking whether he was ignorant, but what he wanted to find out is the truth behind his questions. So his friends saying to "continue existing in what?" is incorrect, because it didn't make any sense. It's a bad response from the friends, but the correct response would be B.<n><n>####  B<n>Answer: B<n>

To verify that the compass is correct, turn the compass around in a direction that would be east or west of true north and see if the compass points to the left like it did in the original direction. If so, your compass is working correctly.<n><n>## Demonstration<n><n>### Video:<n>https://vimeo.com/16876578<n><n>### Video Title:<n>How to use a magnetic compass (video)<n><n>### Input from Above Video:<n>https://education.nationalgeographic.com/encyclopedia/compass/<n><n>If you're heading west, the needle of a compass will point magnetic northwest and the compass dial will show a bearing east of true north.

They had one horse and had to cross the river.  They had two wagons  one full of soda bottles  the other full of beer bottles. The man tells the boy that he can either take the beer wagon and drown the horse in the river, or he can take the soda wagon. The boy takes a deep breath and chooses to take the soda wag on the man asks he if he didn't take beer wagon and he said yes, the man said "I thought so, I would have chosen that too!"<n><n>### Rationales: A man and a boy travelled down a mountain path on a horse, and had to cross the stream to transport the two wagons. The boy has the choice of taking his horse off him, which means that he would be alone on a horse, and then take the soda waggon and put the horse on it, or take the beer waggon and drown the horse to cross the river. I assumed the boy would not be able to cross the river on horseback due to that scenario, and the person telling him to drown the horse was the boy's father, since it is just the boy and his father on a horse. I asked how many horses were on the horse, and since the one person who told the boy to drown the one horse was his father (since it was just his father on the horse), that meant there was only one horse.<n><n>#### Rationales:<n>Firstly, this one took me the longest to do, since when I saw it initially, I had to do a lot of calculating and math, and I thought I was wrong and thought what I had come up with had to be wrong. I am not very good at doing math, since I only did math for one semester I think, and that was 7 years ago. I took the time to take the beer wagons 2, and there were two of them, one of which contained beer bottles, the other which contained soda bottles, so since the soda bottles weighed 8 more, I added the beer bottles with

Choices:  A: kick the bucket B: mortal C: dead D: can die E: dying<n><n>### Response:		 C<n><n>### Justification:  C is a synonym of the word dead and the word dead is a synonym of death, which is the opposite of immortality.<n><n>### Input :A bunny with wings will? Choices: C: eat carrots D: lay eggs E: be a carrot D's mother will have? Choices: C) a rabbit<n><n>### Response and justification:<n><n>The word _carrots_ can refer to several things. The word _lay_ indicates the meaning of a word is figurative, so it's referring to some kind of _laying_. Given what we know so far, a chicken or other land animal cannot lay eggs in an animal. Therefore, the correct response is choice D, _Be a carrot_. The final piece of information provides us with the context of the problem and tells us what the rabbit's mother will be. The parenthetical statement tells us that, if all this is true, then the rabbit's parent must be a female, which tells us that she must be a rabbit, or as such, choice B is incorrect.<n><n>Answer: D is the only option that fits this criteria.  <n><n>### Choice 1 can fit for A) and  B).<n><n>### Choose B<n><n>### Choices 2 can fit for E)<n><n>### E is the correct answer<n>    <n><n>### Inputs:<n> - 11 + 8 = 6x<n><n>### Answer Choice 1:<n> - 1x + 7 + 5 = 13 (Correct)<n><n>### Answer:<n>The correct answer is A = 1.<n><n>### Process:<n>Given: 11 + 5 + 8 = 33<n><n>The first step is to factor 33. The only prime factors of 33 are 3 and 11. If we add 8 to one and 5 to the other - 8 + 5 = 53 - or add 8 to both and use 53 - we get: 11 + (+5) + (8) = 33. Therefore 8 goes with 11, no matter how we look at it.<n><n>The second set of numbers is 5 + 1 and

The number of columns of the data set were five, hence, we will have two arrays as the training set has the size of two. This is because one of the variables of the data train is train_Y. Since, X is an array, and Y is the number of train, one variable cannot be trained in the logistic. Hence, we decided to split them into two separate sets. But, only, one is trained. In other words, we will use the training set to train the logistic, and then check on the testing set by using the test set X to test the logistic trained on the training set X_train. A decision tree was applied to create the model first and after, the model was run through logistic regression to make the final model. The testing set did not change. <n><n>### In conclusion, a logistics model is a kind of model that predicts the presence or no of a condition in a data set. Since, a trained classifier will be used, we have to train a logistic model first using a training set. We take the training set and apply a decision tree classifier to it to predict the presence or no of the condition on the training set. After that, we run the trained classifier over the testing set, and the results are then compared to the testing set label to determine the performance of the

Choices:  A: ocean B: desk C: universe D: attic E: chair<n><n>### Response:		Light goes through object from low to high index of refraction (air to diamond) with wavelengths under 255 nm (ultraviolet light, which is incapable of being seen by the human eye). For ultraviolet light, the "univers" part of the name is the opposite of what one would expect (from "sky" to "ocean"). Ultraviolet light would "light" oceans. Hence, light would be emitted from oceans, and ocean is the correct answer. This is a case where you should ignore the name of something (in this case, the title of the universe).<n><n>#### Light travels from low index of refraction to high index of refractive.<n><n>#### Light = waves, is incapable of going through solid objects, and is a transverse wave.<n><n>#### Light travel through objects from low to high index refractive.<n>

The pursuit of the fox is known as hunting. The fox can run for long distances, and the horses and hounds work as a team to eventually catch the fox. The hunts are an exciting and colorful British tradition, but hunting foxes with hounds is controversial. Animal advocate groups view it as inhumane, while hunters say that fox hunting involves a great deal of caution and a long process before the hunt. Fox hunting can be dangerous, as well, and people who are injured during the hunt may sue for damages.<n><n>#### 15<n><n>Answer: D<n><n>### Input <n><n>A fox hunts are only done in England.

Because of this, john is very careful about the places he goes.  Where might he avoid going? Choices:  A: pet store B: parking lot C: woodland D: north america E: park<n><n>### Response:		<n>Choices:  A: Pet store<n>Rationales:  As stated in question, John loves animals and hates animal abuse so he tends to avoid places where he might see inhumane treatment of animals. A pet store is just that - a pet store.  He avoids pet stores.<n><n>### Choices: B: parking lot<n><n>Rationales: Parking lot<n>While we do not know how and why we can infer from the statement that he loves animals and hated animal abuse that this person is the sort who avoids public places where animals might be mistreated.  A parking lot is filled with potholes and ditches.  Animals in the parking lot will be at risk from cars or being hit by people so John will avoid places like parking lots.<n><n>### choices: C: woodland (forest?)<n>Rationales: Since John avoids public places where there is a high risk of animal abuse.  Forest is just that - an inhabited forest.  He avoids forests.<n> <n>### Choices D: north america<n><n>Rationales<n>He avoids places where there is a risk of animal abuse so he avoids places where there might be a risk of mistreatment of animals<n><n>### Choice E: Park<n><n>Rationales This person probably already knows every park in the world especially the ones where animals are free ranging  and so he would not avoid parks. Parks are usually well established and where there is much more community involvement than most public spaces.<n><n>### Answer:<n>Choice: A<n><n><n>### Input and Demonstration:  Three more than twice as many dollars as 500<n><n>### Rationales:<n>3 more than twice as many =  3*(2*500) = 3*1000<n>Two as many more dollars as 50 means twice as many as 50, which equals 100 so the final answer would be 3*10.  The original expression "two more than twice as many" means two times 2.  When two of a number is added to it, it equals the next number in sequence.  So twice as many is 1 more than twice as many.<n><n>### Output:Two times as many as

Choices: A: 1 girl and 2 boys B: 2 girls and 1 boy C: 2 boys and 1 girl<n><n>### Demostration (how many friends you can choose)<n><n>### Rationales (explanation why)<n>1. Since the lowest grade is in the group, so if the group contain 1 boy and 3 girls, the lowest grade is contained by three girls while one boys have lower grades, therefore, this group is not the best group to choose<n>2. Since the lowest grade in the group, so there should be a pair of friends who has lower grades, and therefore a pair of friends is required too, then the boy should join a girl, and therefore in group B, the lowest grade is two girls and one boy with the lowest grades<n>3. Since the lowest grades in group A is 1 boy and 2 girls, this pair is not required in group A, as we need to pair up one girl with 2 boys, therefore the group you want is A<n><n>4. The lowest grade is in group C, there are four people, thus the grade will not be lowest because 2 girls and one boy together would lower the grade, and a girl and two boys will raise the grade, hence, the lowest grade is obtained by the group A, so A is best.<n><n>5. Group E, C, and D can only contain exactly two friends at a time, as it needs the lowest grade, therefore it is not the best group, hence, Group B is the best group to choose.<n>

The two most common types of civil actions are torts and contracts.<n><n>Instituting civil action could just involve the process of taking the action and it may cause confusion, hurt feelings or just bad feelings.<n><n>However, from the question, the choice of sandwiches is implying that an instance of instituting civil actions could cause good feelings, but that is not the case as we see with civil actions.<n><n>#### 86: What is the result of instituing civil action?<n>Answer: D, bad feelings and confussion, not sandwhiches<n><n>### Instrucion:<n><n>### Input<n>Input: The number of dogs and cats in the neighborhood is 286, plus the number of dogs and caterpillars. The number of dogs in the neighborhood is 130% of the caterpillars, which is at least 50% more than 15. What are those numbers?<n>Rationale: The number of dogs is 130 * <<15= 130*20=260>>260, and the number of caterpillars is 15.<n>The number is 260 plus the number of dogs which is 260+130 = <<260+15=175>>175.<n>Since 286 is greater than 175, the number of dogs and caters are 130 and 15.<n><n>Input: Aaron is the father of 4 children.

The format is:<n><n>What is something that you do first?<n><n>### As you can see, the second one is not so simple with only "Buy a newspaper", "Play video games", "Play with your pet", or "turn on TV". There might be many situations in which you can first read books or turn on TV. For example, to make a cup of coffee first or to set up your computer, first turn on your computer. You might consider both reading books and turn on TV or you might consider turn on TV first because you'd like to watch TV as soon as possible, and then read books.<n><n>### Your answer for the second question depends on your preference, and, there can be many situations. Therefore you have to make a choice. Although turning on TV takes less time than reading books, I'd recommend you to read books first instead of turning on TV. It takes more time to finish a cup of coffee. For example, if I don't have my favorite mug, I might first turn on my TV, because I'd like to watch as soon as possible. Thus, I don't answer A or B as the first choice. Instead, I answer D first by reading books.<n><n>## Acknow

What's one obvious place people might go to celebrate? Choices:  A: state park B: opera C: disneyland D: carnival E: park<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: People might ride rides at a state park. Operas can't be rented, Disneyland is a theme park, and carnivals aren't permanent. <n><n>### Rationale:<n>The carousel and carnivals would be two of the rides A ride at a carnival isn't permanent, and we can't own that. The rides at Disneyland aren't movable. We can rent an opera, but people won't celebrate by doing so. We're going to use the carousel as our example for our answer, because the carnival rides and the rides at Disneyland are more broad categories.  We'll pretend the carnival is just a bunch of traveling carnival workers, and we'll replace the carnivals with the idea of a traveling carnival.<n><n>The choices are:<n>  * A: People might ride r ate rides at a state par the carousel and carnival workers will ride at carnivals. The carnivals are traveling carnival will move from one  place to the next. <n>  * B: People might go to an opera. The opera can't be r ented. People won't celebrate a birthday by going to a carnival, and carnivalse are not celebrations. Carnivals are temporary places, and the places we celebrate have to be permanent. We can not own an opera. <n>  * C: People might go to Disneyland.  We can rent an opera. The carnival rides are more broad categories than a state park, and no one celebrates by going anywhere at Disneyland. Disneyland doesn't provide rides, a state park does. The carousel and the carnival r i tes are rides we'll find at a carnival and at a state park. <n>  * D: The Park. We can't own a park. We can only rent parks, and parks are bigger cate gor ies of state parks.<n>

A recent government report stated that at least four thousand of these weapons are "nonstrategic," meaning that they could be used as explosives for building or destroying things. For years, these weapons have been the subject of major disagreement between governments because they are particularly suited to terrorists and criminals and yet it is not clear how to get rid of them.<n><n>### When it became clear during the fall that the Soviet Union and the United States were likely to sign an agreement on nonstrategic nuclear weapons (the NPT that they had been discussing for the past few years), many critics in Washington were dismayed. They hoped that, if the Soviet Union and the U.S. agreed in principle to get rid of all these weapons, they would agree to get rid of both the good ones and the bad ones. But, because the two countries were at such different points in the negotiations, this seemed impossible.<n><n>### However, last week this situation changed somewhat. The two countries agreed to a tentative deal, that will include an arrangement for verifying reductions in these weapons. Now, there are only the negotiations of the formal document left and, if they go well, the NPT will be ready for the July 1 signing ceremony by both countries.<n><n>### As a result of the agreement, the 150-some nations that are signed onto the NPT can concentrate on making the agreement work. But there are several countries, including Israel, that are not signatories, who fear that once the United States and Soviet Union agree, the other nations might pressure them to join as well. And even the two nations themselves are far from agreeing on specific things-like whether there should be a secret side agreement about destroying biological weapons.<n><n>### Verification of weapons reductions remains a big problem. The NPT is likely to include some sort of arrangement for verifying disarmament agreements; for example, inspectors visiting nuclear plants

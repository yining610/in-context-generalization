The police officer issues him a citation for running the red light.  During his trial, the judge asks the man is driving 50 miles below the speed limit he does not pay attention and his lawyer argues that his driving habits are what caused the serious car accident, not the red light.  The judge says that the man needs to make major cutbacks to his driving habits.  The man starts driving faster than the speed limit and crashes into another car.  The judge increases the fines for the violation of driving too fast.  What does the judge do when a driver makes a cutback to safer driving habits after crashing into another car?\nRationales:: A:The judge increases the fines\nSince he made a cutback to his driving habits, he was driving faster than the speed-limit, which resulted in a serious car accident, where he caused another car to crash into him.\n\n####B:The judge cuts the man's punishment because he started driving safer.\nAfter committing the car accident, the man realized that he caused the accident, and made major cutbacks to safer driving habibs.\n\n####C:The judge gives the man no punishment because he drives at the speed limit.\nHe has been driving at the speed limit for a long time, which is acceptable to the judge.\n\n####D:The judge stops driving and punishes the man severely for doing so.\nIt's an ironic statement.\n\n####E:The judge stops driving forever because he is not allowed to drive at all.\nIt is an ironic statement.

{"text": "D -  Weather can either occur naturally or be brought on at a certain time, it can't be changed or surprised so C can be ruled out. If we use A, that makes happy to be a synonym. We can't say that to be here is the same as to change here or to surprise here. So the only ways that B or E can't be used is if to be happy means to be at paradise, which we don't know, and when to change happens. A, B, and E are eliminated.  Now D or E could both be used as synonyms for occurring. Only one would be right. For D, the synonym would be brought on because it can't be synonymous with happened. For E, a synonym would be to surprise because it hasn't been eliminated as part of B. D and E can only be synonymous if they are all different, so we can cross those out, as well.  We can rule out the synonym of brought on of changed because they aren't synonyms and we can still cross out the synonym of surprise for happy because only one can be correct. A can be ruled out because it doesn't make sense.

The party started and ended between J and I. T, K, L, and M were in the party room. How many rooms of the snowfort were not entered by any of the guests?\nRationales\n  Since we know that there were 8 friends and J was the first guest to enter each room and J was the last guest to enter, then  J was the only guest who entered 15 of the 16 rooms of the fort.\n  There were 16 rooms, except for all the rooms J entered he entered them twice, but there is 1 less room with every guest, except for J. So each room must have been entered 3 times.\n  There were a total of 8 guests that did not enter at least 16 of the rooms.\n  The 16 rooms and the guests that entered each room are:  [15, 15, 14, 14,...1 13, 12, 11, 10, 8, 8, 6, 4, 5] [J, I, M, L, K, T, C, H, F, E, G]\n  By using our information and the information in the image, we can clearly see that H stayed in the last room the whole time", "answer": "C: building"}

C:  The park has a dollhouse in it.  D:  Both Jenny and Steve drew pictures of the house.\n\n### A\n\n### Expand:\nSteve made a drawing of a tree.

{"text": "A: drinking\n\n### Rationale:It says \"If\" they were celebrating the \"occasion\" and \"occasion\" refers to birthday.

How many students are in the meeting?\n\n### Response\nSo there are 12% students who are going to attend the conference and there will be 10 students overall in this conference.\n\n\\$\n12\\\\10=1\\\\112-10\n\\$\n\nThat will be 1.05\n\n#### 1.05 students\n\n### Rationales\nTo be more specific to the students, their proportion has already been given in the question and according to the information, the total number of students is 1.05.\n\n### Input 2\nInput: In an office a person is paid either $10 and hour, $13 and hour, or $15 and hour. If they are paid $13 and hour.  If overtime pay is $2 per hour on all of their hours. How much should the employee be paid?\n\n### Rerponse 2\n\nSo the first part that is given is that the person is paid $13, and there are two possibilities of this happening; for $15 or for $10. \nIf they are paid at $13 then they will make $13 per hour.  If over time at $2 per hour: 1+1=$2\nBut each hour that they work they have already been paid for $13 hours and now they get $2 for every 13 hours they work, so they will get extra paid of $13*(number of hours worked) (13-1)=12*(number of hours worked). \n\n#### 12*$2=$24\n\n### Rationel\nYou already paid a base rate for time of $13.  For every hour that they work you get paid $2 for every hour you work.  All hours in work will be multiplied by 13 and then you multiply that by 2. This will give you the final payment", "answer": "D: happiness"}

This is because the answer consists of either one thing, two things, or three things - so that's the question we're answering.\n\n### Response\nThe correct response is A.\n\n### Justification:\nThe answer to this question is always three of the items on the bottom. A yard is a space between different places in a city, and a subdivision is a space of land with different areas. Therefore, it is a space between different areas, and the answer is that a yard is not a subdivision.\n\n### Explanation:\nA yard is made up by three things, but a yard is not a space. It is a three point space in the middle where two other spaces meet. So the answer is a space between different spaces. That is a subdivision, and not a yard.\n\n### Rationale:\nAs long as you recognize that the options are always three of the options on the bottom, and you take note of the space/thing distinction, you are guaranteed to complete the questions correctly.\n\n```python\nif (choice == 3):\n    chef = [choice]\nelse:\n    chef = [choices]\nprint(chef)\n```\n```\nOutput:\n['A', 'M', 'M']\n\n```\n\n### Input\n\n### Demonsration\n\n### Answer\n\n### Justitfication:", "answer": "C: three feet"}

However, business owners won't lower the price of everything. They will only lower the price of products that they produce more than they do.\n- Taxes increase the price of the products that consumers need the most causing inflation.

This question requires more context for us to decide if the kids were having fun all day. Was this for a few hours, for a few days, or for a few weeks? This leads to a few more questions:\n\nHow many kids did they see? Do they have different ages? Did they just see the same 3-6 kids? How big was the area where they were playing?\nThe context needs to tell us these things in order to properly place this question in the time continuum. This will allow us to decide if the wild ride was before or after the fun, or if it\u2019s an ongoing problematic situation.\n\nIf each kid saw a fun wild ride, but some had a fun wild ride more often than others, then the wild ride could occur after the fun.\n\nIf one or two of the kids had a fun wild ride and the others saw no fun wild ride at all, we would infer the first kids saw a fun wild ride before the rest.\n\n### Input\nThe kids had been playing all day and a massive bear appeared and attacked them. \n\n### Rationales:  \n\n### D: The context of the question does not provide enough information, and therefore, we cannot accurately answer.

Then 5 girls late due to absent, and one boy that is late on average 30 Min.\nYou subtract the two subproblems together to get an answer of 12-5=7 boy late (2 more than the 2 girls late)\n\nYou then add your 30 Min time of your boy that was late, and multiply by the number of boys late with that information. Then you subtract it from your original answer.\n\nIn conclusion, the average time for boys to leave classroom was about 31.2 Minutes late for everyone as a whole.\n\n### Answer:128 Minutes", "answer": "D: united states"}

Then write your answer.\n\n### Rationales\nYou know that if we multiply the second number in a multiplication sentence by anything, it doesn't change anything.  For example: 4*7 =7*4.\nYou can multiply each side of an equation by the same number to eliminate that number if the equation is equal.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation: -2*(-2)+5=?\n10\n-2*-2=-4\n+5=-4\n-4+5=10\n#### 10\nAnswer: 10\n\n### Input 2:\nYou know that if you multiply the second number in multiplication sentence by anything it doesn't change the value. For example:  1*3!=1*3!=3\nSimplify 8*-2=-16\n8*-2=-8*2\n-16 =-8*2\nYou can multiply each sides of an equation to eliminate a number if the equation is an equals.\n\n\n#### -16\nAnswer: -16\n\n### Rationale\nYour first instinct is to multiply each side by -3 to change both sides into negatives. You are close! However, to cancel, we need to use the Distributive Property:  A*B+C = A*(B+C)\n-8*2 -8 (the number in the top of the brackets is what will cancel, in this case 8) = -8*(3+2)\n-8*3 -24= -8*(-3)\n8=(8*(-3))/=8(-3)\n8/(-3)=8/3=-2\nSo, multiply each side by -2\n#### -8*(-2)\nAnswer: -8=-8*(-2)", "answer": "E: wet"}

How much money did Mary put into her checking account?\nRationales\nMary can figure out what she had left in the checking because she can subtract what she spent from what she had left.\nThe $14 she had left in the account is found by subtracting the $84 from her total check balance of $144\n144 - 84 = <<+144-84=60>>60\nIn total Mary spent $84 + $60 = <<=+84+60=144>>144 at the Home Depot\n\n#### 144\nAnswer:?\n\n### Input\nGabrielle and her mother went to the mall to buy a necklace.

How much money do the tickets and the shirts cost?\nRationale: The tickets cost 53.25, not including the money to the shirts.  Because this was from her mother\u2019s credit this money must have been deducted for the tickets also.  We can find the tickets cost by subtracting the money on the credit card from the total cost.

{"text": "The answer is 'Where are people likely to stop at an intersection'. A car will be at the red light. The reason is that a road splits in two and the traffic is allowed to move forward at the same time in each direction.

This is because it is increasing every day, every month and every minute.\n\n\n\n### Rational : 'B' is the only option that satisfies every time it increases in the year. This is because every year is also a yearly period, a monthly period, and a daily period.\n\n### Example : The temperature is always increasing with passing years and days(months), so it will increase every year\n\n### Input :The cost of a shirt increases ______ the more a shirt is bought. Choices : A: the bigger, B: the better, C: the more, D: the worst\n\n### Response : The correct answer is 'The more a shirt is purchased.' This is because the price of shirts will definitely increase as their amount increases.\n### Rational:\nAs we already known, increasing of price is not a bad thing, it is just happening because of the increase of shirts been purchased.  \nHence, in this case shirts purchase can be stated as, \"The more a shirt be purchased, the higher the price\"\n\n### Example:\nI bought a T-shirt. The price of that shirt is S$20. \nIf I buy 2 shirts together, the price of the shirts will be S$40. This is an example of, 'The more a shirts is purchased, the higher the prices is.'\n### Input:Rachel is looking for a new book.  The book she's holding costs $12.

{"text": "Input:\n**A: sneezing**\nRationales:\nSneezing causes allergies (respiratory system). Allergies lead to asthma, which results to lung issues (upper respiratory system). Lung issues such as COPD restricts the air movement from the lungs causing fatigue.\n**C: house clean**\nRationales-the lower respiratory system includes the lungs and large airways. Cleaning or sweeping a surface or dusting would cause us to get up and walk, which in turn causes us to use the large airways of our lower respiratory system. The lungs have many small sacs called alveoli. These small sacs allow us to absorb oxygen into our bloodstream. When we are in a dust filled house, the air is less breathable which can cause fatigue on the respiratory system. Fatigue on the respirator system will cause us to feel irritable, a symptom. \n**D: feeling satisfied**\nFeeling satisfied causes our brain to release endorphins which makes us feel good. The release of endorphins and feel good emotion can lead to fatigue which inhibits the ability to read.\n\n\n###### A.

When she takes the break, she decides she only wants to work for half of the break time.  After taking a break for half of the break, 1.1249944952 units of work are still remaining.  She decides to take a break again for an additional half of the break total.  After the second break is her break total is 1.5624489908 units of work.  At that point, she has the option to return to work or leave for the day.  What percent of the working hours remains when Sara works for a half break as described? Sara should still be able to finish the project if she returns to work after taking the half break.

You don't need to tell people what it does so they'll use it, but you do need to tell us all kinds of things about it. For example, here's the description of the Perl programming language that I found on Wikipedia:  \n\nPerl is a family of high-level general-purpose programming languages. The term is also commonly used to refer to one of the original two dialects of the language, known as Perl 5, as differentiated from Perl 6 (\"Raku\").\nRanked fourth in the TIOBE[10] index[11] which estimates the popularity of programming languages, as of January 2014, it was the ninth most-used language on Stack Overflow.[28]\nPerl 5 began as a research project in 1987 by Larry Wall, a student at the University of Michigan. After becoming unpopular at University, it gained popularity during the late 1980s and early 1990s on its way to becoming one of the most widely used programming languages of the time.\n\nThis is the kind of description I'm looking for. If you want people to know what your language does, tell them. Like if your language is for making games but it uses a programming style that hasn't been used before it would be good to know. Maybe you have your own special way to write variables, or that sort of thing.\n\n- I made up this example language and I am not going to give any details about it other than I think it's cool and some words might be misspelled. And it makes use of 14 of the 17 punctuation symbols. And I decided on 22 variables for 1 letter variable names, 10 2 word variable names, and the 13 3 word variable names. And for each variable it needs it's own line. That's it.\nThis language is 214 characters long!\n\n### Demographics:32 y/o female secretary\n\n### Instctions:\n\n- Can you imagine having to program in a language that is so long?

{"text": "Choice:\n\nAnswer:\n \n #### Supermarket\n\n\\#\\#\\#\\\n\n### **Input:**\nWhat is the average score of a baseball game?\n\n### **Response:**\n  Choice: Choice (a)\n\nAnswer: \n \n #### A: 9\n\n\\#\\##\\#\\#\\###\n\n### Instructions:Write a response based on the instruction.\n\n### #Rationale:\n The average score of a baseball score is a number that is used to represent the whole team\u2019s average performance. It is usually given with two decimal places.\n \n In baseball, each team has between 9 and 27 players, depending on field size. The number of players includes both starters (the nine players on a major league team, or the 22 players on a minor league team) and substitutions. A starting pitcher can last for about 3 innings before he has to leave the field and be replaced by a second (or third) pitcher. A coach might keep 12 pitchers, 2 back-up catchers, 6 infielders, and 4 outfielders on the game day roster.\n\n To calculate a player\u2019s average, a person needs to determine which statistics belong to batting categories. A batter collects statistics when he takes a bat. That means if you put a number for a category of batting, and you get a hit with a runner on second base, then that would affect his hitting average.\n The average score of the game is calculated in many different ways. One method, the calculation of the average score of the game according to team inning in the game, is: average runs scored per game per team inning in the ball game and multiply the total number of runs from the team in an inning by how many innings a team scored a run. \n\n For example, a hit in extra innings is not considered because it will cancel out with an out.\n The average score for a baseball game is calculated in many ways and this is very common.\n\nAnswer: There are generally three different ways to calculate the average number in each team\u2019s batting average: if there are 17 at-bats and 7 hits, the number would be 3.5 which is also 2/5", "answer": "D: soup"}

It has increments of 1 that increase as it goes from 0 to infinity. \nThe first soda cost $7.\nSodas that cost $7 to $14 are on the number line, but the person can only spend 1 amount since that is the increment on the number line.\nSince the person wants 2 sodas and there are only 2 numbers on the number line the increments match the amount of sodas they want. \n### Explanaton 2\nIf the person wants just one soda, then they spend $7 and the increment of 1 from $0 to $7 will be equal to 1. \nHowever, this does not work because the price is not proportional to the increments of 1. \nHence, we can see that this is an inequitable situation.", "answer": "A: sit down"}

This leads us to 99.\n\nThe second question requires us to go into more detail as to what we are looking for, which is the number that is missing from the number.\n\nWe are given that 0, 1... 15 are written on the number line and are ordered as they are written on the number and that they have been written out from the least number to largest number.\n\nThis means we need to find the number that is between the smallest and the largest number.\n\nWith this information we can conclude that the number missing from the number line would be 6.\n\n#### 32\nAnswer:\n\n#### 6\n\n### Output:Find the number that is missing.\n>- ____\n>- ____(the two added numbers)\n\n#### 195\n\n### Exercises:\n1.

Choices: A: hoof, B: Kentucky Derby, C: race track, D: painting, E: Triple Crown\n\n### Democratation:  A artist can commemorate a horse with a hoof by sculpting a metal hoof in bronze.  The Kentucky derby has more at stake with the derby race than other horse races.  The racetrack could be a great place to commemorate an equine.  An artist can commemorate horses with a painting because paintings are forever.  A great idea for commemorating horses is painting and/or placing them in a sculpture.  The sculpture would be immortalized.  I think that horses are more immortalized in a race track as opposed to a derby.\n\n### Response\nInput:How can you make a great pie crust?

It's dark. Some stars are visible so I'd say that most of the beans are not visible. If all the beans were in the can at once, I would estimate that there are no beans visible.\n\n### RATIONALES: Because the stars are visible in the sky, they are not blocking the sun. The fact that most of the beeans are not visible indicates that they are not in our line of sight and there isn't much to see out there. Because its dark, most of the light is blocked.

{"text": "Great\n\n\n### Input\n### Demonstraiton\n### Rationales\n### Answer\n\n### Description:Write a response to the following prompt.\n### The prompt is:\nDuring his birthday party Ben requested to receive a large cupcake and a large jar of jelly for his party favor. Ben's party favor is equal to the difference between 1 more than the sum of his present bag and 3 times the sum of his present bottle and 2 less than the product of his present necklace and 4 less than the sum of his presents hat and 6. All Ben's presents were valued at dollar amounts. How much money exactly is Ben's party favor worth?\n### Rational:The present in his bag and bottle is 86 and the bottle has 294 presents and the bag has 188 presents, 1 more than the bag or the bottle have 99, the party favor is 99-1+3+2-4-6-8= -10=99\n### How to solve it with a diagram.\n### The diagram starts in bag. it moves by adding value in the bag after receiving each present. There is no subtracting because the party favor is not present. There are 86 presents in the bag so the party favors value is 99 - 1 ( because bag already has 1 present) and bag will have  98. The present will move to the bottle and 99 will move to 99 + 3 = 102, 102 is more than 99 so it will move to 102 - 1 = 98. It will continue going through bag and bottle and by the time it gets to the next bottle, 5 presents will have been added to bag so it will move to  98 - 1 + 3 + 2 +6 = 102. Now when the party favor gets to bottle 2 it will move to  102 - 2 and then it will move to the bag and the party favorite will start with 98. When it gets to the second bag it will start with 99 + 1 = 100 and  100 - (2 less than bag) will equal 98", "answer": "C: remarkable"}

The mayor is worried about the town possibly having to pay a big fine because of their odd population number.

Simmons <bjs@example.com>\n\n#### E\nAnswer: E\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Demonstration:Write a rational for the answer if needed.\n\nInput: In order to keep her balance in her hula hooping, Jazmin must spin it at least 8 times in 23 seconds.\nRationales: She needs to keep the hula hoop off the ground for enough time to spin at least eight times.  Each rotation around the waist takes 4/3 sec. How many rotations does she need to make?\nSo, after x rotations Jazmin will need to have her hula hoop off of the ground so that it spins at least 8 times \nIn order to do this she needs 8/6 rotations to keep the hula going for the exact amount of time needed.\n\n#### 8/6\nAnswer: 8/6\n\n### Demostration 2:\nInput: If a basketball player scores 9 free throws in a row without missing, the probability that he will finally miss during one of the last three free throws that he takes is\n\nRationales: the first 7 free throws,  a total of 6 are \"successful\" and there are 1 \"free\" so there is a 0% chance that the 6th free throw is unsuccessful after so many more successes\n\nThe probability for the 7th free throw is 0% because it has already met the conditions for all the other free throws\nFor instance if 7 successful free throws are \"successful\" then the 8th is also successful.\n\n0% is a percentage so if we add the 7 successful free throws to the 8th % then we get 7*0% +8*0% = 0\nThat means the probability that a basketball player will miss a free throw in his 3rd to last free throw will be exactly 0.0%\n\nSince the 8th free throw is unsuccesful the player can keep up the momentum. This means that the probability that he will miss the 9th free throw will be exactly the same as before.\n(Therefore he is free to continue the same trend", "answer": "A: military base"}

So, \u201cfruit\u201d is a word in \u201cfruit\u201d.\n\n### Output(Input):\nThe word that is in fruit is fruit so we say that fruit is a word in fruit and then the word fruit is called fruit and then apple is called fruit as well.\n\n### Input/(Output):\nIf you take each letter of the alphabet in order, then add its place in the alphabet, the sum at the end will be 13.

Its duration to cover the specific distance took 30 minutes as opposed to walking which would take approximately 45 minutes.

{"text": "Answer \"do crossword puzzle\"\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\nIn this lesson, one method of helping you learn better is to create your own rules.  This was a method I used to help me learn some foreign languages, and it is a method used with babies too.  Rationales are what we use to understand our rules.  In the example with the stickers, she put rules in place and when she broke them, she had to follow through to resolve them.  Rationales allow us to explain how we came to an answer and also allow us to check if our answer is correct.\n\nWhen Josh bought the first hat and pencil, he had the $20. When he bought four cookies, he would have had $8, but at the time he bought the four cookies he used up the last of his $8 so the way to think is he had $10 or $20 - $8 = $<<20$-8=12>>12 for the cookies.  If he split it between the four cookies he now had $3 for each cookie.  That means that by the end when the boredom set in, he only had $.75 for each cookie.  Therefore, since the cookies cost $.75 each, he would have none left.  In this answer, all the rationales are used to come to the answer of $0.75.\n\n### Inputs: 1) Josh is at the grocery store buying groceries and can afford a certain amount. 2) An item is on sale for $.50 each and he wants to buy 8 of them. 3) He has $15 in his wallet. 4) He has $20 in grocery money. 5) He can get change for $2 bills. 6) There is not a person behind the counter to ask a question.  \nRationales: 1) Josh can not use two or fewer bills in a single purchase. 2) Josh can not use fractional change such as $.01.\n1st Input: Josh can not spend his last of $5 because there are no more bills left\n1st Input: You can not use fractional bills when buying one item\n1st Input: There is not a dollar amount to give as change\n2nd Input:", "answer": "A: do crossword puzzle"}

For the first part of the song, John and John want to know how many minutes it will take to walk to the game from John's house. Choices:  The first part of the song is about John and John walking to John's house.  They want to know how long it will take to walk from John's house to the ball game, where John and John are in separate houses.  It is written \"John, in the house, walks to the game, walks to the store and buys a cake\"  So the walk from John's House to the ball game is at least the second walk that John takes as indicated by the lyrics to the song.    In the second part of the song, it is written, \"I\u2019ve never been to a baseball game before, he\u2019s never been to a baseball show.  What a great excuse for us not to go\"  So the baseball game is not written about John and John.   The third part of the song says \"At night, we\u2019ll wait, under the sky, we\u2019ll sit and talk, in the cars. And when the fireworks are over, we\u2019ll go running to the playground near John\u2019s house\"  So it is written that the cars are near John's house.

If you act loving, everyone around you will act loving. They'll do nice little things for you like leaving notes or flowers in your favorite places. It's like a contagion in a sense with your love being the virus.\n\n**Wrong:** Love is wrong. Your heart isn't even on your sleeve. Even if you tell the truth and the truth hurts, you'll be seen as cruel and thought of as cold. People will only see the side of you that's hurt them, and with your heart off your sleeve there isn't much else that can be seen.\n\n**Last Forever:** Love is forever. It will last forever, and it won't die. If someone tells you they love you, don't be scared by it, as it might not be true, or you might not have meant it when you said it. Don't be afraid to have feelings of love for someone when you are older either, because that doesn't necessarily make your feelings fake.\n\n**Painful:** Love is painful. Love is so hard and heart-breaking that your heart will ache and feel like it will fall out at any moment. The pain may lessen over time, but it doesn't ever go away.\n\n**Blind:** Love is blind. You'll love even the wrong people. You may not even notice your own shortcomings because you love unconditionally.\n\nYou have to pay attention to each question carefully when trying to answer these questions correctly.\n\n### Reference:\n- https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-contentp/money", "answer": "A: contagious"}

He then lost 11 apples and gave 25 apples away. Which fraction is best to describe how many apples he had after that?\nRationales (The correct answer): If he started with 89 apples, he now has 89-58 = 31.  If he ate 10 then he now has 88-58 = 26.  If he lost 11 then he now has 26-11 = 15.  And if he gave away 25 apples then he now has 15-25= << -3>> -3.\nIn order to get the fraction, we use: << 88/31= RATIONAL/NOMINAL --> 2.75738 * 2.75962 --> 2.76000\nAnswer: 2.76\n\nInput: Jill's father tells her he's going to get a new dog but it's going to cost him $125 for getting it.

Is it cheaper for Jill's father to wait than to buy it now?\nRationales(The correct answer): If we subtract the $125 credit card bill for month 1 from the $300 credit card bill for month number 12, we get $300 - $125 = <<300-125=175>>$. If we take that amount and calculate the monthly cost for 3 months, we would have $175 / 3 = $<<175/3=58>>$.

If I wanted to find the area of the square that's four meters on a side, would I measure its perimeter or its height?\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked the teacher.  \"Well, it's about the same as if you take a square and break it into triangles,\" explained Dara.\n\n### Response:\"I was breaking up all of those numbers into smaller segments in order to come up with a formula for the overall answer.\"\n\n### Rational\n\n\nDara realized she used a similar logic that she used to get the answer to the previous problem.\n\n#### Rationales:\n1. In the previous problem she used the height of the triangle (2) to get the bottom of triangle (2/3 in her expression to make the numbers easier to find).\n2. Here she used the perimeter of the triangle (4) to the get the perimeter of the whole triangle (4+2+2)\n3. Notice that instead of squaring the top of the triangle (4), she squared the bottom (2/3) because squaring a number in the denominant of the fraction will give the result of the whole fraction (2)\n4. The area of a square is equal to the squared length * the length of the sides.\n5. When we squared lengths of the sides of the triangle to 1, we got 4 to which she added the 2 which was the perimeter of each segment that makes up the whole triangle to get the final answer\n6. This is what justifies why she took the perimeter of every triangle since each 2 and 2 and 2 in the denominant of 2, 1/3 and 1/6 are squared to get the lengths 4, 4 and 4.\n\n#### R:\n\n*R:*\nDara came with her own", "answer": "C: fast"}

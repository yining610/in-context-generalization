The dog owner probably thought he could stop the dog's running by yelling. However, the dog only ran in a circle, so the owner would never have the time to execute a \"Go around\" or a \"Go home\" command.

It might seem that C and D will be safe, but we are not really sure what jewelry looks like. D and E will lead us to the same wrong answer \"safety deposit box\".\n\n*Explanation: C and E are not a safe way to keep the jewels on vacation. Keeping the jewel in a safe does not guarantee that it will be safe. A safe deposit box should always be kept separate, whether it is at the bank or some other trusted location.  Keeping it in a box or storing it in a safe place might not keep it safe. However, it will help the owner know that it will be kept safe somewhere. Therefore, E is not correct.\n\n*D and C: The suitcases for jewelry are an obvious answer.

{"text": "For all the things that are happening, and all the things that aren't happening, there's always a simple and effective way of fixing things. Sometimes we have to take actions that are uncommon. The key point with this question is to understand that action is the only way change is going to happen. People are too scared to do what needs to be done and change themselves in order for change on a wider scale to come into action. In order to fix the world's climate crisis we need to change ourselves and the people who know the truth and have the power to speak about it from all sides, and for this we need to get people to realize the importance of change through action, and the only way to do that is to be a social activist.

Choices:  a: multiply \u00f7 b: multiply + c: add + d: subtract -\n\n### Response:(A)\nFor this question, the first thing to understand is that the area is always equal to the product of the dimensions of a rectangle. Then the second thing to understand is that in a problem we want the dimensions of a rectangle to be in a ratio which corresponds to a percentage. Now if they're in a ratio of 3 to 7 then the area is gonna be 3 times bigger than the rectangle in dimensions 7 times bigger than the rectangle as the dimensions of the rectangle are in the ratio of 3 to seven and it's always going to be 3 times bigger. The key point to understand here is that in order to be able to find the area of a rectangle in dimensions that are proportional to the dimensions of a rectangle in the area formula, that area is going to be exactly 3 times bigger than whatever dimensions you start with.\n\n### ANSWER:\nInput: Adam and James were playing football for 4 hours together\nJames and Johns were playing basketball together for 2 hours\nIf James scored 5 goals, how many goals did Adam score?\n\n(A) 4\n\n(B) 6\n\n(C) 7\n\n(D) 10\n\n### Instructions Input:\n(a) How many", "answer": "C: change yourself"}

{"text": "D) school together\n\n### Hint: The verb 'to fish' means 'to buy and eat fish', not 'to hang out with fish'. Also, the statement describes fish, not a group of human beings. Fish are not human beings; humans make up a school. \n\n### Input- What do I need?\n* Noun- plural count\n* Singular or plural form- depends on the noun\n\n### Democritus\nDemos is the plural form 'people'. Krito means 'criticize something', and the suffixes 'os' and 'es' are similar to the Greek forms of 'the'/'for'. To translate 'the criticism of the people', add a new English word, 'of'. Democritus means 'for or the (the) of the people'.\n\n### Dilemma\nMi is the singular'me', di means 'two', and lemma means 'root'. Translated from Greek to English, di+meme=dilemma: literally, 'the two minds'.\n\n### Epiphany\nEpi is the singular 'up' or 'on'. Fanys, meaning 'a revelation', is the Greek word for'showing'. In English, then, an epiphany is'reveals himself' (singular) or'reveal' (plural).\n\n### Euphemism\nEu means well or good, and phemos means'mourning'. In English, an euphemism is simply a pleasant, indirect way of referring to something negative. For example, instead of saying 'I have died', one would say 'passed way'.\n\n### Evangelist\n'Eu' is the word 'good' in Greek. Aggelos means'sends' in Greek. To turn'sends the good message' into an English word, we would take our English word 'news' (good or bad) and replace 'the' with the Greek's'. Agnel is Greek for 'news'. Evangelist means 'good news seller'.\n\n### Exorcism\n'Exo' is the prefix for 'away, from, out'. Kercoumi means 'to cry,' and 'ism' is the suffix 'action' or 'doing'. Exorcism is 'cast", "answer": "D: school together"}

The commands are followed by a space and one of five choices. The answers for those questions are 4, 2 (as input 4 is an even number and input 2 is divisible by 2, thus they were even numbers), 1, 3, and 0. Thus, the program first checks to see whether the input is even (by asking the user if the input is divisible by 4), then it checks whether or not the total amount that was purchased (the sum of the two inputs) is divisible by 5. If one of these checks returns true and the other returns false, the program will divide the total bill by two and print the result. Otherwise, the program will print an incorrect answer. If the user enters the same number twice (the user just re-enters the input), the program will ask what the user wants to do. The options are: \u201crecalculate\u201d, \u201cquit\u201d, and \u201cexit\u201d. The program will recalculate the total for the user and print out the bill.

A few free online resources offer great opportunities to learn how to write software, which is the programming language with which computer programs are written.\n\nAnother step you can take to gain experience with software engineering is to create your own mobile app. There are hundreds of thousands of apps available in Apple's app and Google Play stores, but you can be sure that one or more of them won't be quite what you're looking for. So if you find an app you like but doesn't work for you, why not make your own?

{"text": "A netted drawstring bags are not widely used by people except in airports or other transient destinations.  So, choices A and C are out.\nJewelry and clothes stores use plastic, clear-viewing bags on their displays, but those do not qualify as drawstring bags.  Choices D and E are out.\nYou use these netted drawstring type bags at the airport not because you are carrying valuables (like jewelry) there but because you are carrying liquids (like water), which is prohibited from being brought through an airport.  So, the answer is choice B:  car.\n\n### Input How much oil does a car produce every mile at 55 mph on a highway?\n\n### Response A: If a car produces the same amount of oil when traveling at the same mph on a highway, then a person would consume the same amount oil every mile.  In that case, the gas mileage would be 20 mpg.  So, the amount of oil the car produces is 20 mg.  Since the 20 mg is not given, but it has to be between 0-10g, my best guess is it would be 5 g of oil.\n\nThe answer can be deduced by knowing that the amount of oil used per gallon of gasoline is 5. We know the gasoline engine is 20% efficient, so 20% of 5 would be 1 (1 gallon is about 0.55 mg of oil).  So 20 mg = 5 mg of oil.  The car is consuming 10x as much oil as it creates in 1 gallon of fuel.  So, 1 liter = 10g.\n\nAnswer B: The answer would be 0.5. \nAccording to one source (https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-oil-consumption-from-the-motor-of-a-1000cc-engine-per-1000-KM/answer/Ryan-M-Cox) per every kilometer traveled, \"A medium car with an average fuel economy of 13.3 km/L would use around 0", "answer": "E: laundry room"}

Let's say Dance, get drunk, and having fun are all the same category of task, so we'll use that for that category.  This means there are 2 choices.\nYou just need to figure out what each of the options correspond to.  What choice is best for having fun?  That one.  What choice best suits having a good time or meeting new people, or dancing.  That one.\nNext up, let's figure out dance options from choices A and B.  They seem to be very close, but we can still make a case.  Let's look at choices B again.\nThere's an indication that meeting new people involves partying.  Also, choices dance have different connotations for different things.  If we look at each for meeting new people, the two options correspond to the same group of things.  This means choosing B will always yield the same thing, so we can ignore A's choice.  Now we have one answer left: the option that doesn't involve having fun.\nThis means, in the end, we are using this formula:\n\n- Dance: C\n- Having fun: D\n- Having a good time: E\n- Meeting new people: B\n\nNow, let's look at drinking and having fun.  We can use A's answer, so if we say that if A=E, then D=E.  This doesn't tell us much other than that there is no difference between dancing and having a good time.  We can still use the above formula though:\n\n- Drinking: A\n- Having fun: E\n- Having a good: D\n- Meeting new: C\n- Nothing: B\n\n### Sample Solution\n1. Elijah", "answer": "B: getting drunk"}

For example, if bread_quantity is 6 and the list of ingredients is [flour] [30] [$1.00], then the ingredients will be measured, 6 batches will be made, after which flour will be used up and discarded.  If the amount of bread does not meet the demand of customers, the function should increase the supply by the difference such that it has the minimum number of batches of any other possible value after the operation.\n\n* The baking function processes the ingredient list by measuring the weight of each ingredient and adding together, then subtracting the total weight measurement from the quantity of ingredients.\n* The cost is calculated as the total weight multiplied by the number of batches.  The ingredient's supply is zeroed out each time the ingredient's measurement is used.\n* After the calculation is complete the difference variable is set to the total weight amount (before measurement), less the actual weight amount (after measurement).\n* After the difference function, the difference is divided amongst ingredients until the difference is equal or higher than the demand. (Ex. There is a difference of 12.4 but the demand was 12)\n* The weighting of the ingredient increases by the difference after each call to the difference function.\n* The costing of all additional batches is equal.\n\n** NOTES **\n* There will be a 4th function that subtracts the cost from the price, only if the cost has a negative value.\n\n** Input:** baking(bread_quantity, [flour] [40]", "answer": "A: pet store"}

{"text": "The best place to store a woodwind instrument is on the symphony where it receives the most practice and exposure.\n\n#### Reasoning: The question does not give examples that are similar in a number of ways, which makes this problem an outlier.

C: A place that allows the instrument to actually be played. D: A location that is commonly associated with wind instruments. and E: A store that deals with other instruments. The key to this question is to remember that it is an orchestra of woodwinds only; in other words, all of your instruments share the room and the same practices there. The symphony orchestra is the place to find them, and the best place for them is on the stage so they are able to have more exposure.\n\n### Input\n\nQuestion: The best way to do something is to put your whole heart in.\n\nChoice: The best way to eat is to enjoy your food.\n\nChoice:\n\nChoice:\nChoice:\n\nChoices:  \nA: Put your hand over your heart.\nB: Put your hand on your stomach\n\n### Response\n\nThe best way to do something, such as eat, is to put your whole hand over your heart.

These tests should have results when you run the code grader on your code.\n\n- **How can I check for my own mistakes and other errors?**\n  - Make sure you have a **debugger**, either **Chrome Dev Tools**, **F12**, or **VSCode Console**. You will not be able to fix a bug without a debugger.\n  - Make sure your program does not throw any errors. These errors can occur for a variety of reasons. For example, you can put in an error by not initializing memory in a function.\n  - Don't forget to check the **Tests** at the bottom to make sure your program compiles and runs, and that no runtime errors were thrown.\n  - **Be sure to check the solution code**, which is available to you on canvas.

Thus, your total profit from donuts is at least $60 more than your total profit from croissants for the day.", "answer": "C: castle"}

The clue above will tell you how.\n\n### Problem Explanation Example Instructions:\nProblem Explanation Example Response:\nProblem Explanations always begin with a clue that explains the problem. An example problem is:\n\nI love my pet dog, she is the sweetest, biggest, warmest, friendliest dog I have ever known! My dog's size is described by the following dimensions: Length, Width and Height.  What is the length, width and height of my dog?\n\nIn this case the clue is: The clue says that the dimensions are length, width, and height. This is to say that we are getting three measurements or clues; and not just one or two.\n\nWe are told what the dimensions are (length, width, and height) however, we are not told what our exact values are; what they equal to.\n\nThere are three possible values, and with three possible values, the maximum number of answers are 3 to the number of possible values.  Which in this case, means that the greatest number of values we could have, is three.  So if you are looking to guess any of the values for dimension 1, dimension 2, or dimension 3, then the maximum possible number of values is 3.", "answer": "D: mouth"}

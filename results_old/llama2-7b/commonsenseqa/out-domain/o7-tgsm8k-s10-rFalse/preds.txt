Choices:  A: neighbor's house B: bridge C: home D: homeless shelter E: prison<n><n>### Response:		<n>- The answer to this problem is E - Prison, however, that does not quite answer the question. If Jimmy is on the verge of divorce, or has already divorced, that could be a more appropriate answer<n><n> - It could then be asked why the man is currently on probation. If the answer is for drinking and driving, then the appropriate answer is D Homeless Shelter. A probation is not generally for anything else than driving under the influence, which homeless shelter is only for those with that specific issue.<n><n> - Another possible answer might be A neighbor's house for those under-age who can not get a beer legally. There are even laws against kids under 12 or 13 that prevent them from buying things at their parents house.<n><n> - Another way to answer this question might be in reverse, which would be a better answer A or B, is there is a bridge near where they live? B is an incorrect answer in that the bridge is not something that any 19-year-old is likely to go to.<n><n><n> - I think that we cannot answer how many cups of liquid that the two boys drank.<n><n> ### Question from a practice test<n><n>### Instructions:Read the passage below and answer the question that follows.<n>The New England colonists first arrived in North America in 1607 and built a settlement at Jamestown, Va.

If the dog owner wanted to "Keep going," he needed to use another verb like "continued," and no longer give commands.<n><n>### INPUT: If the mild weather is 68 degrees and the cool weather is 50 degrees, what weather is closest to 68 degrees?<n><n>### RESPONSE: The weather that is closest to 60 degrees, or the degree of the temperatures, is that of mild weather.<n><n>### If Tom, the inventor, and his daughter, Sophia, who are building a robot, had to choose from one of six parts to fix the robot, which would they choose: the hand, the face, the feet, the eyes, the brain, or the head? Choices:  (The hand, the face, and the feet)<n><n>### R: Tom and Sophia would try to fix the robot first by using the body parts of the robot itself. They would want to use the hand and the feet, since those body parts could be the most versatile if they had any kind of malfunction in the robot.<n><n>### What number did the dog count when the owner's son was counting with the dog?

Choices:  A: suitcase B: department store C: safe deposit box D: these twos are not safe way to transport jewellery E: lady's boudoir<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>B<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>### Input, Demonstration, and Explanation<n><n>*Input: What is not a safe way of transporting jewelry on your vacation? Choices -  A: Suitcase, B: Department store, C: Safe deposit box, D: two ways are not safe way of transporting Jewellery and E: Ladies boudoir.<n><n>*Demonstration: A and B represent "a safe way" as we see from the title. It might seem that C and D will be safe, but we are not really sure what jewelry looks like. D and E will lead us to the same wrong answer "safety deposit box".<n><n>*Explanation: C and E are not a safe way to keep the jewels on vacation. Keeping the jewel in a safe does not guarantee that it will be safe. A safe deposit box should always be kept separate, whether it is at the bank or some other trusted location.  Keeping it in a box or storing it in a safe place might not keep it safe. However, it will help the owner know that it will be kept safe somewhere. Therefore, E is not correct.<n><n>*D and C: The suitcases for jewelry are an obvious answer. Because they give us the answer of A which is not correct, B was not correct.<n><n>### Input and Demonstration<n><n>*Input of how many goals scored in a game of a Barca against two players last season account for 20% all goals scored in the League. If the players scored the same number of goals, and total number of goals scored by the two players last season against barca is equal to 300, Calculate the number goals played. A: 15 B: 30 C: 15 D: 30 E: 10<n><n>*Demonostration: A: 15 not. A equals 300 - 20 * 300/100 = 260 and A = 160, which is equal to A / 4, which, again, is not correct. B: 15 not: B equals 300*300 / 20, which is 27

Choices:  A: riots B: vote C: change yourself D: social activism E: change clothes<n><n>### Response:		<n>For all the things that are happening, and all the things that aren't happening, there's always a simple and effective way of fixing things. Sometimes we have to take actions that are uncommon. The key point with this question is to understand that action is the only way change is going to happen. People are too scared to do what needs to be done and change themselves in order for change on a wider scale to come into action. In order to fix the world's climate crisis we need to change ourselves and the people who know the truth and have the power to speak about it from all sides, and for this we need to get people to realize the importance of change through action, and the only way to do that is to be a social activist. Change starts with social activism, and there's never an easier change to bring about through action than making people more aware of the things that are happening and aren't happening that concern us.<n><n>### Input:(a) How do you find the area? Choices:  a: multiply ÷ b: multiply + c: add + d: subtract -<n><n>### Response:(A)<n>For this question, the first thing to understand is that the area is always equal to the product of the dimensions of a rectangle. Then the second thing to understand is that in a problem we want the dimensions of a rectangle to be in a ratio which corresponds to a percentage. Now if they're in a ratio of 3 to 7 then the area is gonna be 3 times bigger than the rectangle in dimensions 7 times bigger than the rectangle as the dimensions of the rectangle are in the ratio of 3 to seven and it's always going to be 3 times bigger. The key point to understand here is that in order to be able to find the area of a rectangle in dimensions that are proportional to the dimensions of a rectangle in the area formula, that area is going to be exactly 3 times bigger than whatever dimensions you start with.<n><n>### ANSWER:<n>Input: Adam and James were playing football for 4 hours together<n>James and Johns were playing basketball together for 2 hours<n>If James scored 5 goals, how many goals did Adam score?<n><n>(A) 4<n><n>(B) 6<n><n>(C) 7<n><n>(D) 10<n><n>### Instructions Input:<n>(a) How many

Choices:  A: pets B: fills the pond C: attempt to fly D: school together E: breath in water<n><n>### Response:		D) school together<n><n>### Hint: The verb 'to fish' means 'to buy and eat fish', not 'to hang out with fish'. Also, the statement describes fish, not a group of human beings. Fish are not human beings; humans make up a school. <n><n>### Input- What do I need?<n>* Noun- plural count<n>* Singular or plural form- depends on the noun<n><n>### Democritus<n>Demos is the plural form 'people'. Krito means 'criticize something', and the suffixes 'os' and 'es' are similar to the Greek forms of 'the'/'for'. To translate 'the criticism of the people', add a new English word, 'of'. Democritus means 'for or the (the) of the people'.<n><n>### Dilemma<n>Mi is the singular'me', di means 'two', and lemma means 'root'. Translated from Greek to English, di+meme=dilemma: literally, 'the two minds'.<n><n>### Epiphany<n>Epi is the singular 'up' or 'on'. Fanys, meaning 'a revelation', is the Greek word for'showing'. In English, then, an epiphany is'reveals himself' (singular) or'reveal' (plural).<n><n>### Euphemism<n>Eu means well or good, and phemos means'mourning'. In English, an euphemism is simply a pleasant, indirect way of referring to something negative. For example, instead of saying 'I have died', one would say 'passed way'.<n><n>### Evangelist<n>'Eu' is the word 'good' in Greek. Aggelos means'sends' in Greek. To turn'sends the good message' into an English word, we would take our English word 'news' (good or bad) and replace 'the' with the Greek's'. Agnel is Greek for 'news'. Evangelist means 'good news seller'.<n><n>### Exorcism<n>'Exo' is the prefix for 'away, from, out'. Kercoumi means 'to cry,' and 'ism' is the suffix 'action' or 'doing'. Exorcism is 'cast

Input: Adam bought 3.5 kilograms in total.<n>2. Input: The number of goals against Barca accounted for 20% <n>3. Input: Stella and Twingle joined 6 others who worked at the same rate<n>4. Input: The cost of refueling the tank went up by 25%<n>5. Input: A pen has a capacity of 2.5 milliliters<n><n><n>### Instructor feedback (if necessary)<n><n>The program takes the input from the command line. It asks the user to type in two commands. The commands are followed by a space and one of five choices. The answers for those questions are 4, 2 (as input 4 is an even number and input 2 is divisible by 2, thus they were even numbers), 1, 3, and 0. Thus, the program first checks to see whether the input is even (by asking the user if the input is divisible by 4), then it checks whether or not the total amount that was purchased (the sum of the two inputs) is divisible by 5. If one of these checks returns true and the other returns false, the program will divide the total bill by two and print the result. Otherwise, the program will print an incorrect answer. If the user enters the same number twice (the user just re-enters the input), the program will ask what the user wants to do. The options are: “recalculate”, “quit”, and “exit”. The program will recalculate the total for the user and print out the bill. Otherwise, the program quits.

How many cups of liquid did the two boys drink yesterday?<n>Answer: 36<n><n>### Input:What would a person do if he or she wanted to get good grades? Choices:  A: feel proud B: try to learn C: need assistance D: thank god E: read alot<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Input:(1st problem)<n>If Adamin wants to know what does 3 kilograms and 2.5 Kg of nuts and dried fruits costs, he needs to multiply the price of the each one of the items with it's quantity.<n><n>### Input (2nd problem)<n>Johns goes to the gymn 3 times a week, but the thing that change is he will spend a third of the time in cardio and warming up. To know how many hour did he spend at the gymn he multiply the quantity of time in each one of the section by days of the week.<n><n>###Input(3rd problem)<n>Now that we know the new number of goal scored the solution is calculating the difference between two numbers that are equal by dividing by 2 and then subtracting these numbers. <n><n>###Input (4th problem)<n>Now that Tommy drink all the day he need to work in percentage to  learn how many cups of liquid he drink at a day. If he drink 8.5 pins of coffee, 250 ml each, there we have 20.25 Liters, if 6.55 of water (assuming 1 Liter in one gallon) we have 6.55 x 8.5 or 56.2 Liters. The solution is to take 48 Lt per person so there we have 24.1 Lt of coffee and 24.1 Liters of water.<n><n>###Response (5th problem)<n>If Elijah drank (8.5 pins +9.5) pins of liquid that means that Elijah drank a total of 8.5 Liters of liquid. To say that the quantity of liquid that Elijah dran was 8.5 Litres, it should be written `(8.5 pints) litres`. Now that Elijah drain 9.5 Liters of fluid, that means that Emilio drank 8 Litres of water. There we have a solution to the problem.

Additionally, the career counselor at your school can help find opportunities in the technology industry or a job for you that will help prepare you for the technology industry. And, you can also consider volunteering for opportunities to get some real-world experience with technology.<n><n>###  Question:What else should you consider when selecting a graduate school? What other steps can you take to gain experience with technology?<n><n>###  Response:<n>If you were thinking about pursuing a career that is related to software engineering, one of the best ways to learn the fundamentals of programming is to teach yourself how to program. A few free online resources offer great opportunities to learn how to write software, which is the programming language with which computer programs are written.<n><n>Another step you can take to gain experience with software engineering is to create your own mobile app. There are hundreds of thousands of apps available in Apple's app and Google Play stores, but you can be sure that one or more of them won't be quite what you're looking for. So if you find an app you like but doesn't work for you, why not make your own? For example, a few of the free resources I've mentioned include an app that teaches you to program with Swift by using Swift Playgrounds (which is an iPad app that allows you to write and preview Swift code right on your device), and it also allows you to build your own app

Choices:  A: airport B: car C: jewelry store D: garbage can E: laundry room<n><n>### Response:		<n>A netted drawstring bags are not widely used by people except in airports or other transient destinations.  So, choices A and C are out.<n>Jewelry and clothes stores use plastic, clear-viewing bags on their displays, but those do not qualify as drawstring bags.  Choices D and E are out.<n>You use these netted drawstring type bags at the airport not because you are carrying valuables (like jewelry) there but because you are carrying liquids (like water), which is prohibited from being brought through an airport.  So, the answer is choice B:  car.<n><n>### Input How much oil does a car produce every mile at 55 mph on a highway?<n><n>### Response A: If a car produces the same amount of oil when traveling at the same mph on a highway, then a person would consume the same amount oil every mile.  In that case, the gas mileage would be 20 mpg.  So, the amount of oil the car produces is 20 mg.  Since the 20 mg is not given, but it has to be between 0-10g, my best guess is it would be 5 g of oil.<n><n>The answer can be deduced by knowing that the amount of oil used per gallon of gasoline is 5. We know the gasoline engine is 20% efficient, so 20% of 5 would be 1 (1 gallon is about 0.55 mg of oil).  So 20 mg = 5 mg of oil.  The car is consuming 10x as much oil as it creates in 1 gallon of fuel.  So, 1 liter = 10g.<n><n>Answer B: The answer would be 0.5. <n>According to one source (https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-oil-consumption-from-the-motor-of-a-1000cc-engine-per-1000-KM/answer/Ryan-M-Cox) per every kilometer traveled, "A medium car with an average fuel economy of 13.3 km/L would use around 0

The answer is 10 then 9 followed by the next numbers in the list 8 followed by the list of the next numbers - which is 7.<n><n>### When a question asks for heights in feet. A foot is 12 inches so the shortest measurement is 10 ft 1 inch since that the next shortest is 10ft = 120 inches (so 10 of those inchs is 10 x 12) or 120 inches( 120). <n><n>### If the list of the player's heights is reversed in descending order it will look exactly like this answer since each player will have been moved one position down to the left so the same answer can be reversed and it will still work.<n><n>### For any extra questions of the same input to this question answer to the following: <n><n>### Whenever they want

If the correct answer were B, the answer would be C.  If the correct answer were C, your answer would be E.  If the correct response were D, your answer would be A.  If your answer were E (correct answer), you would answer B.<n><n>### Justify your answer.<n>A: Get drunk<n>B: meeting new people<n>C: dance<n>D: have fun<n>E: do a good job<n><n>### Sample Response<n>Let's first solve "A" for each of the choices.  Let's say Dance, get drunk, and having fun are all the same category of task, so we'll use that for that category.  This means there are 2 choices.<n>You just need to figure out what each of the options correspond to.  What choice is best for having fun?  That one.  What choice best suits having a good time or meeting new people, or dancing.  That one.<n>Next up, let's figure out dance options from choices A and B.  They seem to be very close, but we can still make a case.  Let's look at choices B again.<n>There's an indication that meeting new people involves partying.  Also, choices dance have different connotations for different things.  If we look at each for meeting new people, the two options correspond to the same group of things.  This means choosing B will always yield the same thing, so we can ignore A's choice.  Now we have one answer left: the option that doesn't involve having fun.<n>This means, in the end, we are using this formula:<n><n>- Dance: C<n>- Having fun: D<n>- Having a good time: E<n>- Meeting new people: B<n><n>Now, let's look at drinking and having fun.  We can use A's answer, so if we say that if A=E, then D=E.  This doesn't tell us much other than that there is no difference between dancing and having a good time.  We can still use the above formula though:<n><n>- Drinking: A<n>- Having fun: E<n>- Having a good: D<n>- Meeting new: C<n>- Nothing: B<n><n>### Sample Solution<n>1. Elijah

Choices:  A: under bed B: symphony C: music room D: band practice E: music store<n><n>### Response:		The best place to store a woodwind instrument is on the symphony where it receives the most practice and exposure.<n><n>#### Reasoning: The question does not give examples that are similar in a number of ways, which makes this problem an outlier. The choices that are outlined are very different, in that A: it is a place that you don't normally find instruments, which is the bed. B: It is a room, which is very different than an orchestra. C: A place that allows the instrument to actually be played. D: A location that is commonly associated with wind instruments. and E: A store that deals with other instruments. The key to this question is to remember that it is an orchestra of woodwinds only; in other words, all of your instruments share the room and the same practices there. The symphony orchestra is the place to find them, and the best place for them is on the stage so they are able to have more exposure.<n><n>### Input<n><n>Question: The best way to do something is to put your whole heart in.<n><n>Choice: The best way to eat is to enjoy your food.<n><n>Choice:<n><n>Choice:<n>Choice:<n><n>Choices:  <n>A: Put your hand over your heart.<n>B: Put your hand on your stomach<n><n>### Response<n><n>The best way to do something, such as eat, is to put your whole hand over your heart.

He then scored 10 goals a game and when Tom scores 12 ounce cans of soda and 64 ounced water drinks in his entire day, the total water which is 868 ounces are three hundred less then 868 and that is 838 ounces of water he drinks. It takes six hours for Stella and Twinkly to complete filling up a large truck at the rate of 600 hundred rocks filled an hour. Afterwards, 6 more people then joined in.

The quantity W, D, and M are constants because of the use of a crane. The only variable is G because of how much gravity is being shown in the crate.<n><n>### Description<n><n>There are two possible solutions of three unknown quantities. First, `M > D`. This solution makes sense because a crate will weigh something as gravity is applied to it. Next, `M < D`. Because this value was impossible.

Choices:  A: measure distance B: england C: office D: drawer E: desk<n><n>### Response:		Choose D.<n><n>### Why it worked:In the instructions it says "one kilogram of nuts" it would only be one kilo because there are a bunch of nuts. Likewise the response answers one gram of dried fruits. Additionally, the person must be buying a single kilo because otherwise it would be just stated as 'his purchases'. The responses answers one gram of dries fruits.<n><n>### Alternative: What if the rulers were in different languages? Choices: A: english rulers B: spanish rulers C: chinese rulers D: french rulers<n><n>### Response A:<n><n>### Why It's Wrong:In this case, the rulers would be in different languages, so it wouldn't matter if they were in the same drawer or not. Since the instruction says 'the rulers must be owned by different people', we can guess that the rulers might be owned by two people, so this would most likely be the right answer.<n><n>### Response B (incorrect):<n><n>### Why is it wrong:The rules are in different languages so they can't be in the same drawer. The person could have different cups, and they could not be owned by the same person. <n><n>### Alternate response (incorrect):<n>

For example, if you used the car, that value should be returned by your function. Use each of the following pieces of information to help you determine the cost of the product, based upon the product purchased.<n><n>The product purchased costs $15 dollars<n><n>The person purchased 20 units of this product<n><n>The person's per unit cost is $15<n><n>Example:<n><n>CarCost(product)<n>The value of each car is $6,000, and the total cost of each car is $144,000.<n>To buy a car is to spend money. The person purchased 3 cars and the total cost was $432,000. The total cost was $144,200, calculated by the function:<n>CarCost(20)(3)=$432,080<n><n>Inputs: 10,15,12<n><n>Outputs:512<n><n>#### How would you approach the creation of this function in Python?<n><n>Use an if... else statement to distinguish which product was purchased. Use the price of the product to calculate each unit. Multiply each unit by the quantity purchased. Add up the quantity purchased to get the total amount that was purchased. Then use a ternary expression to determine if the product was a car or not. If it is then add an additional $6,00 to the total amount that was spent. Call your function PurchaseProduct.<n>

You know your donuts normally sell 6 times faster than your croissants. Which item should you focus on making in your shop each day to bring in the most profit?<n><n>### Response A:<n>Every day people who are allergic to peanuts call into the store.  Each caller who has an order for a donut will order exactly 100 donuts.  Because of this, you order 36 times as many donuts per day as croissants.<n><n>### Response B<n><n>You know that your croissants cost $23 per dozen and the donuts cost $26 per dozenn<n><n>### Demondration:<n>The total number of donuts sold each day = 36 X 6<n><n>The total number of croissants sold each day = 12<n><n>### Response C<n><n>Because of what you know about your customers and your average gross margin, you will likely sell at least 140% of what your actual demand is.  If you sell donuts at a gross margin of 70% you have a total profit of 70% on the donut sale.  This is $70 X 6 = $420.  Thus, your total profit from donuts is at least $60 more than your total profit from croissants for the day.

Choices:  A: make B: raise C: entice D: build E: fix<n><n>### Response:		<n>I don't know what the answer is for this one, but I thought it was fun to try and come up with one. The bar was beyond repair which is a good indication that something should have been done to fix it before it got to be in the state it was in, and that's what I thought you should do. To build a new barn, you have to raise the old one to get it out of the way first, and even though the old one was beyond repair, there was probably some good wood in it that you could use in the new one. I believe there are plenty of great old barns that are either raised or completely rebuilt with the original wood used in the original construction that would stand the test of time.<n><n>### Input2:Write a short description for the following word or phrase.

An example problem is:<n><n>I love my pet dog, she is the sweetest, biggest, warmest, friendliest dog I have ever known! My dog's size is described by the following dimensions: Length, Width and Height.  What is the length, width and height of my dog?<n><n>In this case the clue is: The clue says that the dimensions are length, width, and height. This is to say that we are getting three measurements or clues; and not just one or two.<n><n>We are told what the dimensions are (length, width, and height) however, we are not told what our exact values are; what they equal to.<n><n>There are three possible values, and with three possible values, the maximum number of answers are 3 to the number of possible values.  Which in this case, means that the greatest number of values we could have, is three.  So if you are looking to guess any of the values for dimension 1, dimension 2, or dimension 3, then the maximum possible number of values is 3.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:What could happen to a paper if you leave it outside even if it does not move?

Hurley Is 11 years older then Richard so Hurley  is 26. The year Hurley Was Born, Richard Was 4. 15 years ago Richard was 23,  and Hurley was 34. So the 40 year range is 40 to 40 + 24*4 = 128.<n><n>This is not a very complex math problem but can be thought of  as  how to find the "whole", "half", "quarter", "eighth"   and so on. The solution is in the question - "their combined ages forty years  from now will be _______ years." So how can you find "their combined ages?" First you have to find how many year Hurley is 40 years from Now. Then you figure out how many years Richard is, and finally you divide  by 2. Hope this makes  sense.<n><n>---<n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:John and Jane were a couple.

He moved to California where he works for a friend's business.  Here there were more office parties, and there was a bigger chance he'd get on the board of directors.  Even better though, the rent was only $650 for the entire apartment!  The job paid $900 per month and John was able to stay within his budget.  When is the last time you've done it? <n><n>### Response : A good job<n><n>### Answer : Yesterday.<n>#### 11<n>#### Question #2: A good job <n><n>### Instructions : Read the passage and then write a response.  It took them almost 6 months, but Mike and Sarah finally graduated from their MBA program.  They were anxious to get jobs,  but they weren't willing to consider any job, good or bad.  Once they got their jobs, though, the reality of the situation sunk in;  not being able to find work was a LOT easier than working!  Mike's first job was in marketing and he had great bosses and co-workers.  He earned about $40,000 a year.  He could really pay off his student loans!  Sarah, on the other hand, didn't like her new job.  She had to work long or strange hours, and the pay wasn't nearly as good as what Mike earned.  She still appreciated having a job though, since her student loans and credit cards were looming over her head every time she opened her wallet.  She finally made plans to go back to school and get her teaching certificate.<n>#### 35<n>#### Question #3: A large class <n><n>### Input ; A large class<n><n>### Instructon : Complete the table below with the appropriate value.<n><n>### Demo :<n>Large class<n>1: 26/8<n>2: 11/8<n>3: 11/16<n>#### 11/11/11 <n>#### Question #4: Huge payment <n><n>### Demo:<n>8,000<n>7,520<n>8,500<n>8

As the virus spreads from cell to cell it damages the cells it uses until finally the person infected dies. Viruses are passed through bodily fluids, such as blood and saliva and also through sexual contact.<n>After a virus has been attached to a human cell it is known as an virus particle.<n><n>Once it has reached the cells of the human body the virus damages DNA inside the cells which leads to infection of the cell and then the virus reproduces. The virus attacks the human cells and prevents them from functioning properly. The cells may begin to die within days as the infection grows.<n><n>Viruses are extremely small organisms that live in the cells of living organisms, humans included. Like living organisms, they need energy from the foods that they eat to survive.<n><n>Some viruses contain RNA, but many contain DNA, which is a genetic material. Just as a living organism needs food from the environment to survive, a virus needs food from the human host. Usually the virus acquires this energy, called nutrients, from the food that we eat, but can also be acquired from the air through breathing.<n><n>While it is still living, a virus can replicate itself and reproduce by making copies of itself to be sent to invade new cells and new humans.<n><n>#### Input C - R

So, we choose the first choice, which is being happy.<n>2.<n>The word that was used was "have fun", instead of "has been fun" or "will have fun". This shows that the person is actually having fun right now.<n>3.<n>A phrase that would describe happy is "growing merry”. It doesn't mean glee, it means “to grow merry.” “Grow” is an adjective that means to become greater or better. The only nouns that would fit into the phrase are “merry” or “happy”. “Merry” is an adjective and also means to be happy, so it fits. So "growing merriely" shows that someone is being happy.<n>4.<n>The first choice was being happy, and it doesn't say what you are happy about. There were other options that showed you were happy about something, for example, you were happy that you learned a new skill, but now the next choice only shows that you are happy, it doesn't show why.<n>#### Option A: 5<n><n>### InputA:Anne received $26 from one of her friends.

Choices:  A: hear testimony B: go somewhere C: see exhibits D: outdoor concert E: surf net<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Choice A<n><n>This option requires going to a place like an arena for example where there will be people talking about it. A concert in outdoors might require going out of the house for some period of time in general.<n><n>### Choice B<n><n>This option requires to go somewhere. For instance, going to the grocery store or visit a friend nearby your house. Both options involve going to a place.<n><n>### Answer 2:<n><n>The option A and B are not the right answer because they involve going somewhere. Choice C is a better answer. Choice C does NOT require going anywhere and is a good option in this case because we don't know the exact area of the house or what the conditions are. Since the options in C don’t require going somewhere and are available in the house, C is our answer.<n><n><n>### Input Choice A: If a person has a lot of knowledge about a subject but can't help those who request from him, what would you do? Choices: A: staying away from people B: volunteering C: hiding C<n><n>### Response 2:<n><n>It seems that in this case, the subject of knowledge doesn't come with the responsibility of the knowledge. We assume the first sentence describes the previous scenario, and it also describes this scenario. So the choices apply. Choice A and B are out of the options. It would seem that the knowledge and request comes in one conversation, so by hiding he doesn't help anyone.<n><n>### Input 3:<n><n>You may have heard some expressions in English about people who like to talk. Here are a few of these expressions. Choices: A: talk all day B: all talk and no action C: speak softly D: more talk and no action E: full of hot air<n><n>### Response2:<n><n>Full of hot air is a good answer because it describes the previous two expressions and the question. When you say "all talk and no action," it is easy to figure out that the one who is "talking all day" is having all the talking but no action. Hot Air is the expression, "All talk and no action." It explains the fact that A has the "action" and the B has the "talking."<n><n>### Input<n><n>You may have a friend who speaks a funny way.

It's a natural language statement that expresses a need someone has for a system. It's called a Business Question because it is asked by Business Analysts working for business people, to identify business requirements.<n><n>For example, "Who should we invite to this company meeting? Our meeting space can only fit 100 attendees. We have 180 people in our company. I think this is a good idea because if we give people a choice, we'll get more people show up since they won't have to feel that only the best people were invited".  That is a business question. The resulting answer to the BQ might be "Send invites only to our top 180 employees. If an employee is in the top 180 and can't make it, ask him to assign a proxy. If an employee isn't in the top 100, send him an email describing the value of participating but that space will likely be limited. Our meeting should generate a 90% attendance rate, which is what we need to plan for".<n><n>Business questions are sometimes used to determine the content for a [Requirements Traceability Matrix](http://www.it-process-maps.com/requirements-management/traceability-matrix/). The output of such a matrix is called a business requirement in SBOMs.<n><n>

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:If I wanted to see a lizard in its natural habitat but I do not speak Spanish, where would I go? Choices:  A: utah B: south america C: new hampshire D: japan E: new mexico<n><n>### Response:		C, because the lizard is not native to new hampshire. It is only native to Utah<n><n>### Input.<n>A small river runs through a desert. A bird watcher wants to count the number of birds. The bird watcher plans to use a boat to float through the river without getting wet. On the river bank, he sees a small hole in the ground where the birds go to drink. The bird watcher will use the boat and float the bird watching river, counting the number of birds. To determine the number of birds, he will count the number of times that a bird jumps from the hole in the ground to the grass.<n><n>What is the cost of gasoline to drive along the river to the bird watching river?<n><n>Rationales: The cost of gasoline to boat along the river is $125,000. When you find the cost of gasoline for the bird watching river, you can find it by taking the total amount of money left after paying for the boat. If it was 125000 - 50000 = 75000 then the cost would be (75000/5) = $<<75000 / 5 = 15000>>15000.<n>So if the gasoline on the bird watching river is $15000 then its $1500/2 so its $<<15000/2=7500>>7500 dollars.<n><n>### Input<n>Tom has 12 blue balls and 12 red balls. He puts the balls into 12 transparent bags so Tom cannot tell which is blue and which is red. He shuffles the bags but leaves them in their place and goes to bed. Tom wants to know which bag is red.<n><n>How long would Tom have to do a probability guess at the bag that holds the red ball?<n><n>Rationalizes: Tom should put all the bags in a line. Now he knows that each red ball can be in the middle or towards the end, but he will need to put the 6 balls in a row. There are 5 bags left to do this in and they will need 2 guesses each to be sure they are not mistaken, so 5 x 2 = <<5 x 2=10>>

Is this good or bad? Choices: Good Bad Neither<n><n>Neither: Average is an arithmetic average of two numbers (x + y ÷ 2) It is possible for the average to decrease in spite of actual numbers changing or increasing.<n><n>### Rationales: Mean is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers. Mean does not take into account the quantity of data available. It can be said, for example, if we have two numbers the mean does not care whether the quantity of data is equal. Take two values [5, 9], the resulting mean of 7 is just as likely that the mean would be [9, 3] with a mean of 5.0.<n><n>### The same meaning can then be said as follows: the mean is the set of numbers taken together divided by the number of numbers (also referred to as the sum of the numbers). If we have 15 18 then the mean of 1 = 9.<n><n>What was the mean of the data [5, 9]? This is calculated by calculating 5 + 9 = 14 then 14 divided by 2 = 7.5. This is in error due to the fact that the set is 5 + 9 which would then equal 14. The error is that the mean can only be reached by finding a sum and then dividing by the total. Because 5, 9 cannot be added together the sum of 5 and 9 gives a different number to the mean.<n><n>### If we add a quantity that is equal in order to increase the quantity available for the mean, this means that the mean would be closer to the true mean because there would be more numbers to divide. [5, 9, 3] 8.<n><n>### For example, if we replace the mean by the word sum, we could add two numbers that give the resultant (5+9)+3 = 16. 16 divided by 3 = 5.67. This is the true mean.<n>### This way, in order to get the mean a specific value must be available in the set. If there is only one item in the set,

If I check my mail tomorrow, I will have 5 fewer letters, some packages, and the same number of packages and letters. How many letters do I have?<n>### Response<n>Answer:<n>**Method:** Since we do not have any information aside from the initial number, we have to make an assumption to continue the question. We pick option two. A letter is picked from his mailbox and after that he will have 5 fewer. So in a week, he picks a letter. Next week, he has 9 fewer letters. We can make a pattern 9 - w + 3 which tells us that the pattern is 9 letters and a package - 8 letters - 1 package - 8 letters, etc.<n><n>### Choose one of the solutions to the problem provided to you. Write a comment explaining why your chosen solution is correct.<n>### Solution 1: Let's say you check your mail a little later.  You get 8 letters and one package. If you check the mail 3 more days, you will have 8 letters, a package, and no letters.<n>### Comment:<n>Solution: You have to look at each choice and see which choice will result in the least letters. The 3rd choice is the result that will result in the least number of letters. He will start with 8 letters and a package. So 4 more days will result in 4 less letters.<n><n>### Solution 2: Let's say your friend got a letter and you didn't. Let's make a hypothesis

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car.

The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where could you find a laundry room that is only used by staff? Choices:  A: house B: hotel C: green house D: college E: dorm<n><n>### Response:		Because a dorm is a place where students live, they must have laundry facilities. There must be dorms/colleges on a college campus. Therefore, the answer is D: college.<n><n>### Input<n><n>A. A laundromat is open 24 hours a day, is equipped with coin operated washers and dryers, charges customers, and offers no other services.<n>B. A laundry room is part of an office complex and only open during office hours. It offers only one washer and one dryer and is also only used by staff of the office complex.<n>C. A laundry services provides wash, dry, and fold services and is available for both residential and residential customers. Their rates are higher than the laundromat listed in part A.<n>D. A laundry is just a room that has washing machines and dryers inside and provides services on site.<n>E. A guest laundry is found on the first floor of a hotel and is open 4 hours per day.<n><n>### Response<n><n>Because only employees use the laundry room, it is clearly part of an office complex. In addition, it is not 24 hours. Therefore, it is not a laundromat and the answer is B.<n><n>### Answer:<n>B. Answer: Only the employee section.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Because only employees can use it, the only people using it is people using the office complex. That means it is an employee section.<n><n>

Then + <0.334 x Los Angeles> <264=L.A.-0.334*L.A.=<<-116>>-116> total mileage to Los Angeles from Denver, which we will find in our google maps or <google maps 264+-116=<<264-116=148>>148.<n><n>### Answer:<n>**Distance:**   <148 miles>  <n>**Description:**   The town of Parker, CO is <148 miles or approx 2.5 hrs> away from Los Angeles, CA<n><n>### [https://learn.freecodecamp.org/en/grant/6df

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where would you find a metal rod in most people's preferred method of transportation?

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads.

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:How do geese normally get from place to place?

This is correct usage of British English because it's a single word instead of "I am going to have a look or I'm going to have a look". He is also unsure of where his homework book it at so he asks "could you tell me where his/my homework book is".

You play with someone, you might eat something, and you might have been somewhere, but you didn't go to any museums. Eat? I have no idea what you'

He purchased a video game for $19.95. Three days later, he finds that $20 had been taken from his bank account without his consent. Jonathan wants to know if the video game company refunded his money, and he is hoping to figure out who took the money. He has discovered the following transactions in his bank records: On June 9, he transferred $20 to his debit card to pay for the video game. On June 12, he was notified that he had a transaction on his account: the video game company refudneded the $20 transaction. On June 16, he transferred $105 from his savings to his debit card. On June 18, $25 was taken from his debit card. He needs help figuring out the total remaining in his savings account right now. In words, what number equals savings - debit?<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>Jonthan first transferred $20. From account 20 to account 1952<n>Then, that is refunded. From account 1951 to account 0.<n>Also, a new transaction: $105 from account 2 to account 1969.<n>Another new transaction: $25 from account 1968 to account 1975.<n>To find the remaining amount of savings, subtract $0 from our 1975, which is the new amount after the debit, which is $105+(25-573)<n>The remaining amount of savings is our answer.<n>It should be $0 because that is the amount of his savings before he bought the game, and the second to last transaction refunded what was taken out to buy the game.

The problematic answer is A and E, the first choice is B and the second choice is D, and is therefore incorrect.<n><n>### Input<n>We'll call two people competing contestants A and B. We want to know whether contestant A will win the competition. We will use the following rules to determine who the winner will be.

If contestant B gets one more play than contestant A, contestant B wins<n><n><n>### Response<n><n>The first step is to figure out the total number of guesses made by both contestants.  Each guess made in the competing game is a move that the contestant makes, which should give them a little edge in the game. If contestant A played one game more than contestant B, then contestant A won the game because they played one extra game in the end and have a total of 2 guesses in the game, and contestant B played only 1 game and has a total of 1 guess in the game.<n><n>Contestant A will lose to contestant B when contestant A played 1 game more than contestant b, but played 1 game less than contestant B which is 1 more than contestant B which makes 1 guess. Therefore, the game will be broken into two. Contestant A will have 2 games played giving them a total two guesses, and contestant B will have 2 games, giving him a total of 3 guesses.<n><n>In order to determine the winner you have to add the numbers of the total guesses, which will be contestant A : 2 + 2 = 4 + contestant B : 3 = 5<n><n>As seen on the chart below "if B has + play (1 Guesses)" is when two players play 1 game extra with each player, the winner is contestant B because the total of their guesses is 5, and contestant A is 4.<n><n><n><n><n><n>#### 3<n>4 3 Guesses 2 Guesses<n>1 2 Guesses  0 Guesses<n>A 4 3 Guesses E 2 Guesses

Choices:  A: open meadow B: arctic tundra C: beach D: great outdoors E: england<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>##### C<n>Fox hunting is an old English tradition that consists of hunters using dogs to chase and catch a fox. The fox is then pursued through fields or woods by horseback riders. The tradition had once been widely practiced and is often depicted in art, but there is a lot of negative attention toward fox hunting due to mistreatment of the animals involved and harm to native wildlife.<n>##### A<n>An open meadow is an area filled with grass like land found in fields or at the bottom of hills. It is not a forest. It is a landscape with different levels of sunlight that helps plants grow. This is a location in which no forest are found in.<n>##### B<n>The Arctic has very little vegetation and a temperate climate. The Arctic Tundra is a large area in northern Canada, United States, and Russia. The vegetation is extremely little and the temperatures are very low. This is not a location where a fox could hunt.<n>##### E<n>England is located in the northern hemisphere on the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean. An area where the climate is not very diverse and the temperatures can range from 32 Fahrenheit to 59 Fahrenheit, in the spring. The fox does not live in England, the fox lives in the forest.<n>##### D<n>The great outdoors is a term used in the United States to describe open spaces and unimproved land. However, there are many things that can not be done in the open space or an unimproved area. Hunting is one of those things.

When she applies this rule of higher prices sells more merchandise, sales increase.  Determine how much more she sells each day.<n><n>### Solution:<n>Let x represent the cost of the item to start with. Our rule is that for each 5 dollars increase, that will encourage purchasing two items.  Each 5 dollars increase in the price will encourage two additional items sold.<n>1. The cost of items sold in a day in the beginning is x. We will write 5x to represent the cost of the first added 5 dollars.  2. The cost of items now is 6x + 5x = 11x.   We will write 7x + 5x to represent 12 more than 6x.  Each 5 dollar increase encourages purchase of 2 items, and we need all the encouragement twice, because of the rule, so if 7x + 12 is 170 or more, then the amount must increase by 130, which will be 260.

Choices:  A: backpack B: bookcase C: office supply store D: office E: class room<n><n>### Response:		 The answer is the office supply store. Homework will be collected in the classroom, so the homework might be in the classroom. Homework will most likely be in the students' binder, however, the binder will most likely be in their backpack. If a student misplaces their binder, they would ask a classmate, and in the case that none are able to lend theirs, their parents would take them to an office supply store to get a new binder. The teacher most likely has extra paper in their office supply store that is for homework assignments and can be used by students in the classroom if students need excessive paper.<n>Homework will most likely be collected in the class room if the school offers free wifi or internet. The teacher may create or purchase their own materials and supply them to the students in the class room. The school may have free wifi, so that the students can also work in the library and not confine themselves to the house.<n><n>### Input : Find the value of 500 + 2500 + 3500<n><n>### Response : 6000 (500+2500+3500)<n><n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: It costs more for 64 pieces of fruit to have in a fruit basket that for 32 pieces of fruit.

They wish to rent a tent, tables, chairs, plates, glasses, and candles. The wedding party would like to have the dinner served on the beach, so they will need the tables to be transported to the beach (they do not have a car). All equipment costs $5,500 for the entire event. The wedding party only wishes to pay for plates, glasses and candles. They have two days to pick up the equipment before the big event (the rent is due tomorrow). A rental company gives the wedding party $200 in rent. If they pay for the rent today, how much can each guest pay for the dinner? <n>#### 55<n>Answer: 55<n><n>Rationales:  First find how much we have available on the day of the event. $1500-550 = << $1500 - $550 = 950 > 0 >> 950 - 40 = << 950-40=510>> then 510 / 4 = <<510/4=127.5>>127.5 and divide again to find how much each guest should pay by $127.5/60 = << $127. 5/60=2.1 >> each adult guest pays $2.1

In other words, it is the value of a company's stock divided by the price of its assets. For example, if a firm has a total market value of $90 million, with assets valued at $60 million, its P/B ratio would be (90/60) = 1.5. For companies, a number below 1 indicates that they are selling for less than their book value.

How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Society cannot exist without numbers.   They only rise up in what sort of spaces? Choices:  A: population B: populated area C: create government D: group of people E: make person sick<n><n>### Response:		Society cannot exists without numbers. For everything there must be something or someone to count. It is easy to count when there are many objects, but when it comes to government or a population, it is easy to lose track. Therefore A is correct.<n><n>---<n>### Input: Choices:  A square has two sides that are equal to the other.   A trapezoid has two sides that are longer than the other sides. Choices:  B: all of the above.  C: length equals length.  D: length plus length.  E: length minus length.<n><n>### Response:"All of the above" B, C, D, and E are correct. The only type of triangle that has three sides of unequal lengths is an equilateral triangle. Squares, trapezoids, rectangles, and anything that has only sides with equal lengths are all in the same category of having three sides of equal lengths.<n><n>---<n><n>### Input:#Write a response that describes a task the user must complete.<n><n>### Input 02:<n>What is 0.495 divided by 3.352 in simplest form?<n><n>Input 01:<n>Rationales:<n>Find a fraction that is in simplest form first.<n>.495/.005<n>.495 = 495/1000<n>.005 =.005/1<n><n>.495/1 = 495 / 1<n>So.495 is in simplest form.<n>1/3 =.333<n>Divide both groups by 3,.333/.333 = 1<n><n>.435<n>.334/.334 = 1<n><n>0.4336666....<n>0.435/.435 = 1<n><n><n>#### 1 Answer: 495<n><n>### Input #02:<n>So 0.496 / 3.36 is the same as 495/3.352<n><n>Input:<n>So.496/.3352 is 1.50045.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:The crowd wasn't that big.

Choices:  A: launch pad B: circus C: aircraft carrier D: large open area E: space station<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer is C: aircraft carrier<n><n>### Rationale:<n>I was a little confused about this problem because the options "launch pad" and "circus" seemed to be out of place. However, if you think about it, an aircraft carrier is a "launch pad" in the literal sense. The same rationale can be applied to "circus". If not, I believe an aircraft carrier would be the best option because it is "found" in/ on the ocean.<n><n>### Questions<n>For each question, write a response, considering your answers and the rationales you provided.

The answer is D because the camper looked at the starry night skies and when he did he felt like it was a vast night sky and that the nighttime sky was vast and grand. He felt like his feelings where small in comparison to the size of the night sky.<n><n>### Input : The average salary for that job was $42,000 per year.

What was the starting pay for that job?<n><n>### Response :<n>### The correct response is $120,000 per<n>year.<n><n>### The job had an average salary of $42,0, and $22,0 is less than $42,0. So then the other person who made $60,0 should be making more than $60,0. The salary amount must be over $60,0, with the difference from $22,0 being $38,0. The difference between the minimum and average salary is $38,0, thus $22,0 + ($38,0 - $22,0) = $120,6.<n>

This particular instrument has three different parts. The first part is like a calculator, which has all the conversion tables and the conversions for different measurements. So the second part is a part where you type in the question that has to do with converting. This is like the prompt asking a question for what you need to do in a lab. The prompt is like, “So the answer to this was, so you have to calculate the conversion for this.” And then the answer is a number. You plug it into the next part to see if your answer is correct. And you see if your answer is wrong, correct, how much it is. The third part is where you see the answer to your questions. It helps you to see how close to the answer you are based on your answer. So the third part can show you the difference between your answer and the answer, if you entered the wrong answer. It can help you know how much better or worse your answer is by your calculation, but it doesn't show it to you if you have the right answer. <n>

Choices:  A: self pity B: communication C: understood D: pain E: embarrassment<n><n>### Response:		In yelling, you are communicating. In order to communicate, there is a receiver, and that receiver may understand what is being communicated or not. When you are communicating with someone, you are also expressing yourself to them. The person may or may not understand what you’re trying to express, and you may or may not understand that person. Yelling about the pain of a bruise does not express self pity to the listener. A person yells when they have been hurt. Since yelling is an expression of pain, there is no self pity in yelling, only pain.<n><n>### Input :Sally got a dollar for doing six chores.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:What could fighting inflation cause if it is not successful? Choices:  A: problems B: not noticeable C: deflation D: economic instability E: eat cake<n><n>### Response:		It could cause not noticeable problems.<n><n>### Response Explanation:<n>When you fight inflation successfully, it means that you keep the price at the level that you are used to (which is, the same as the inflation). This is why you can just fight inflations (this means do nothing). The result is then that the inflation is not noticeable and there won't be any problems.<n><n>## Input:If the GDP rises from $200 million to $222 million, the GDP increases<n><n>## Explanation:<n>$$<n>\begin{aligned}<n>1 &+& 1 = &2 \\<n>2 &+& 1 & = &3 \\<n>3 &+& 2 = &5 \\<n>\end{aligned}<n>$$<n>There is no way of calculating GDP that has been done wrong.<n><n>## Input What is the sum of all the prime numbers from 2 through 29? Choices: 1987<n><n>## Explanatino:<n>The sum of all the prime number from 2-29 is:<n>$$<n>\sum_{number} 2<n>$$<n>As we know, the sum of all prime number from 1-29 (because we skip 1 as it is not prime) is 1987

Choice A is the correct answer.<n><n>### Input (What you need to know in order to provide an accurate answer):<n><n>I need a few hints on answering this question. In the body of the question, I understand that it has to do with choosing a location. Specifically, it has to do with a beaver. I would like you to give me a hint as to what type of area the beaver does not leave.

Two different people said opposite things about where to build a house.<n><n><n>Write an expression that will determine if the person on the left has the better argument.<n><n><n>Rationale<n>It seems like a complicated decision to me. A house could be built in a bad environment with good weather. The only solution is if they would consider the cost. The house will have to cost too much. I would say that the person on the right has a better argument. He's right in saying a good argument. He is referring to good weather. If its snowing, it might be a problem. The other argument doesn't make much sense though. Cost is a big factor. A house is expensive. If the weather is bad, no one will go inside.<n><n>#### Answer:<n>I think the second person has a better argument because he knows that a house can be built in a bad weather and it will be still okay. The other person thinks that weather doesn't have an impact on a house so he is wrong. <n><n>### Input A student wants to make a project for a science class.

How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:The man tried to run, but he could not.

He CANNOT move, so he must "stand".<n><n>#### ​B: go quickly<n>Rationales: We know that the man can only move, so the only options are to "stand still" and "move quickly" which are both bad options.<n><n>#### ​C: walking<n>Rationales: As we said in A, the man couldn't move, so in order to move, he has to move quickly, that isn't bad, except he couldn't move at all, so "walk" is the only non-bad option.<n><n>####  D: stand still<n>Rationales: This is still bad, because he couldn't move.<n><n>####  E: walk slowly<n>Rationales: Same idea as walk, but walking slowly is still a bad option, because we still said that he CANNOT move in any way.<n><n>####.......................<n>..................<n><n>Answer:....<n>

How do you know which equation to set up?<n>Richard: For example, today I was looking at the number 80 and I realized that if you flipped it around and upside down you got the number 08. So I set up an equation with two equal signs which means equals, and I set 80 equals 08, and then I solved the equation. The answer is 2.

It’s kind of like how my teachers are always going, “Richard, can you make your point more succinctly,” but they mean it as a complaint!<n>How do you know how to make your point more succintly?<n>```<n><n>### Rationale<n><n>Because you know more about the equation and can describe it better than Joe.<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>```<n>Richard should tell Joe to go to a website [www.math.com/mathematicians-of-the-past/234-alexandre-gauss.html](http://www.math.com...15-234-ale...).<n><n>Joe: Well, I can’t do that.

These employees are able to look beyond their own personal needs to the needs of the company. They are also able to hold onto these ethics when the temptation to break the rules is great, such as when the company is overstating their profits to investors. Many times, an unscrupulous employee will join a company to steal from the company. For this reason, companies must carefully conduct and verify the background of individuals they are hiring. Internal auditors must closely monitor employees to make sure that they do not engage in any illegal activities.<n><n>###### 456<n><n>###### 6487<n><n>###### 84610<n><n>###### 5336875<n><n>### Rate:<n><n>#### B: B: Skilled accountant<n><n>Skilled accountants are needed to keep the financial records of the company straight and the transactions legitimate. For this reason, ethical accountants are needed. Some people do not understand that not all business practices are ethical from a Christian perspective. For example, payday loan companies are making money because of the desperation of individuals who are financially struggling to make ends meet. For companies like this to be profitable, this means that the company is being financed by people that are not being paid enough to handle their credit appropri

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where would someone learn to play an upright piano?

He wants to set some ground rules with his siblings. Pablo feels there are too many video games on their family game system, which makes him think that playing them all the time isn’t good for his health. He wants to decide how much time the family spent using this. One option is to create two categories: video games and non-video games. He would like to split the time by the number of games available in each category. If there are seven video games and five non-video games available, what is the percentage of time played using an available video game?<n><n>Rationales:  To get the percentage of the video games played, we want to divide the time used playing the video games by the total time spent playing all games.<n>(7 divided by 12) x 100 = <<7/12*100=58.3%=58.3%>>58.3<n><n>### Answer:(58.3%)

Choices:  A: sitting down B: refusing C: saving money D: sit down E: go outdoors<n><n>### Response:		The bus was full of people going home after a long day at work.<n><n>### Detailed Explanation: The man was trying to take a bus. He states that the bus is full of people going down to a full-size bed. We know this because the bed has two seats. This means that the bus is full. If the bus is full, the only reason a person could sit on the full-size bed would be if the person was going home after work, because it’s bed time. The bed is full up with full-size bodies that would all be sitting. Only after a long day at full time, would one sit.

Then he estimates the time as 5:30 and opens his eye. Then since he looked again he has to be correct.<n><n>### Answer 2:<n>B: The man closes an eye and estimates the time to be right around 5:30<n><n>### Explation: The man closes his eye for about three seconds or twenty four seconds before making his guess. That means he will be off about 40 percent since it is impossible to estimate an exact time to the second. Since his guess was 40 percent higher, it must be the closest choice.<n><n>### The answer is B because the man closes one eye to try and estimate a time to be almost 5:30 because the man wants the answer to be 5:00 AMC after 6 the show airs.<n>### Input: What

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Eating breakfast in bed can make you feel what, assuming that you don't spill anything? Choices:  A: vomiting B: pleasure C: happiness D: contentment E: mess<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The correct answer is choice (c): happiness.<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>#### Pleasure<n><n>Assumption: If you have spilled your breakfast, you are unable to eat.<n><n>In addition, if you have spilled your food, your "happiness" status is questionable.<n><n>#### Vomiting<n><n>Assumption: You feel ill, nauseous, or want to run and vomit.<n><n>Also, vomiting is an action that happens while lying in bed, so it makes sense that if you vomit upon waking in your bed, you are unable to lay in it.<n><n>#### Joy<n><n>Assumption: Joy is an emotion of delight, gladness, or happiness.<n><n>Also, joy is an emotion that is a good, warm feeling.<n><n>#### Contentment<n><n>Assumption: Contentment is a feeling of quiet pleasure, satisfaction, or enjoyment.<n><n>Also, contentment is a positive feeling.<n><n>#### Messen<n><n>Assumption: Messen (mess, noun) = "to make (something, like food or drink) dirty by mixing it with food, drink, or dirt."<n><n>As a result, you can only feel contentment if you have not messed up your bed or breakfast.<n><n>[Answer]: (c) happiness<n>

It has high, steep sides. A gorge might have a waterfall. A gorge occurs where a river changes direction sharply. But a gorge is not formed from erosion wearing a hole in soft shifting material. If Sam is wrong, what will he call the place? Choices:  D: Plain A: Hill C: Sandplane B: cliff<n><n>### Response A<n><n>### Input A gorge has high, steep walls and is formed where a river changes direction suddenly. A gorge is not formed by erosion shaping a hole in soft, shifting material. If a gorge is wrong, what will Sam call the area? Choices: C: Sandplain D: Plain E: mountain B: Cliff<n><n>### Rationales To decide whether a gorge is right or wrong,  it is important to look at the description. The gorge should have high, steep sides as well as a change in the path of a river.  It should also include a waterfall. If these points are met, then the gorge is appropriate. The gorge formed in a soft, shifting material cannot be formed by erosion. So it cannot possibly be a gorge. It should also not be called a plain because a plain has low, flat land that is not covered in vegetation. The sandplain is flat and dry. The mountain is tallest elevation above land level.<n><n>#### 1<n>Answer: A<n><n>##  Instruction:<n>Grace goes to the doctor.  She's seen Dr. Lewis so many times she calls him by his first name, Joe.  Her heart is beating fast.  Dr. Lewis explains that this can happen because she is young, fit, and her heart is in healthy condition and it sometimes beats fast when one is anxious.  Dr. Lewis tells Grace that she may suffer from anxiety because she has seen him so often.  Grace says that she knows Dr. Lewis is only trying to help her.  Dr. Lewis responds he has been doing research on adolescent health and his team at the local university found a link between visits to the doctor and anxiety. If that's the case, then

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where can the legs of a stool be built?

The group did not believe there would be any reason to choose a value that would make a relationship that didn't reflect reality.

Explain your answer.<n><n>For example:<n>Explain the difference between "A" and "B"; "A is like this" and "B is like this."<n><n>B. Correctness explanation:<n>It is correct to say that someone outgoing will seek for new experiences because, they are likely to become an adventurous person, who is outgoing and fun-loving. They will be the type of person who enjoys life, makes new friends, goes to parties and loves to be with friends. According to some online sources, someone outgoing is an extrovert. It is not true to say that they will be looking for playful people since they are also not playful, and if they are the person will surely get along with them. Outgoing people look for opportunities on the other hand they are also looking for people with whom they can meet for dinner, work and other activities but they will not seek a good person who is playful since they don't like playfulness in the first place. Oppositely, people who are playful have nothing to do with someone outgoing because they are more to be looked at their looks and looks are not part of outgoing people.<n>#### 2<n>Answer: A<n><n>### Explanation:<n>It's not correct to say someone is looking for beauty since beauty is not outgoing. Also, no one is looking for a person with good looks since they will never be interested in meeting people with good looks. This sentence is also correct because outgoing people do have some adventurous personality and are also looking for a house of their own because they have a lot of friends to house and they enjoy parties.<n>#### 6<n>Answer: B<n><n>### How to write an excellent explanation and get excellent results:<n><n>Explain the differences:<n><n>A.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:You are seeking to provide yourself what when you're applying for a job?

Choices:  A: heartburn B: have fun C: enjoy D: gas E: food poisoning<n><n>### Response:		The answer to this is not any particular choice but rather a combination of choices. We will start by eliminating some of the answers from the choices.  We can see that the answer is not A because the next ride would actually involve them having more fun.  Next, we can see that the answer isn't B either because again, the next ride would not involve them having heartburn because they got burnt. So we know it is not A or B.  We can eliminate either C, E, or D because they all involved eating the hamburger. We can eliminate either the rides or the eating of the hamburgers, so the answer is not D or E.  If they take a break to eat a hamburger, they can talk about what they will eat on the next ride which would be A, B, C, or D.  The answer is A, B, and C.<n><n>#### Answer: A, B, C<n><n><n>### Response<n><n><n>### Answer:A, B, C<n>

If it's "f" with no "k" then it's either a fruit like "grapefruit" or another word like "face." If the answer begins with "c" it would be "candy" or "chest."

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:What creatures performing pollination are loved my millions?

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the name of the animal and its breed. Have the program create five dogs, two cats, one hamster, one snake, and one bird. The program should also prompt the user to enter the owner’s name and have the program display the owner’s name when the application starts. Have the program then create a Pet object from the information entered and display the owner name and pet’s name to the console. Next, the program will prompt the user to choose either an animal or a pet. If the user chooses a pet, then have the program create a pet object, retrieve the owner’s name, and display both names to the console. If the user choose an animal, then have the program access the pet object from the Animal object, using the object instance name. Next, the program prompts the user to input a choice other than animal or pet, and have the program display both names and the message that cannot choose an animal or pet. If the user selects a pet, have the program retrieve the pet object’s owner’s name by using the object instance name, display both names and have the program exit the program. If the user selects an animal, have the program access the object’s attribute owner property and display the name to console.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Illegitimate designer handbags will not have a certificate of what?

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:When going to sleep what noise does a human make?

Otherwise, the guess is displayed as a strike next to the guess.<n><n>### Display Directions:<n>Every time a guess is made, a prompt is displayed, and the computer asks whether to continue. Once all guesses have been made, the computer displays a winner message if there is a match, or the loser message otherwise. If there is a winner, then a congratulations message and next hidden word option is displayed. If there is a loser, then a try again message is displayed.<n><n>### Finished Directions:<n>Once the game is complete, the user can either choose to play a new game, or exit. If the user chooses to play a new game of hide and seek, a new guess is entered and the game starts over.

You arrive early at the airport for your flight and your friend joins you soon after. But when you check in for your flight, the airline tells you that the seat you reserved is not available because you did not sign in on time. A. Which one of the following describes this situation?<n><n>### Demorstation:Signing in on time for the flight requires the passenger to be at the airport at least 20 minutes before the scheduled departure time. Your friend arrived soon after you at the airport for the flight. Hence, B<n><n>#### B<n>B. You are ineligible for any refund because of the new regulations. C. The airline company provides better service to their passengers by providing more room for people who check in early and on time<n><n>#### C<n>The situation in question is that of the friends who arrived at the airport late. For the sake of this question, it is being assumed that the friend who arrived late at the airport is trying to book his seat at the last minute, and thus is trying to book a different seat than what they had initially reserved.<n><n>#### Answer: B<n><n>### Inputs(Part 3): You take a taxi to an airport before your flight is to take off. When you arrive, you discover that you have to wait in line for at least 40 minutes before you are to board your plane. How much would a taxi to the same airport cost for another passenger? (Assume an even length line and a 10-minute wait.)<n><n>### Demo:<n>The cost of a taxi is usually based on the distance, and there is also a time factor for waiting in line. If a line is evenly spread out then for each second of delay, there is at least a 5 minute wait, for a total of 10 minutes.(this is assumed based on what has been previously learned regarding queues and waiting)<n><n>#### Answer: 10<n>

The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where do you buy a glass of wine?

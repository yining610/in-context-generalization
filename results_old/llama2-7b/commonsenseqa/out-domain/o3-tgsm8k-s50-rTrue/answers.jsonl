For instance, going to the grocery store or visit a friend nearby your house. Both options involve going to a place.\n\n### Answer 2:\n\nThe option A and B are not the right answer because they involve going somewhere. Choice C is a better answer. Choice C does NOT require going anywhere and is a good option in this case because we don't know the exact area of the house or what the conditions are.

When you say \"all talk and no action,\" it is easy to figure out that the one who is \"talking all day\" is having all the talking but no action. Hot Air is the expression, \"All talk and no action.\" It explains the fact that A has the \"action\" and the B has the \"talking.\"\n\n### Input\n\nYou may have a friend who speaks a funny way.", "answer": "E: surf net"}

It's a natural language statement that expresses a need someone has for a system. It's called a Business Question because it is asked by Business Analysts working for business people, to identify business requirements.\n\nFor example, \"Who should we invite to this company meeting? Our meeting space can only fit 100 attendees. We have 180 people in our company. I think this is a good idea because if we give people a choice, we'll get more people show up since they won't have to feel that only the best people were invited\".  That is a business question. The resulting answer to the BQ might be \"Send invites only to our top 180 employees. If an employee is in the top 180 and can't make it, ask him to assign a proxy. If an employee isn't in the top 100, send him an email describing the value of participating but that space will likely be limited. Our meeting should generate a 90% attendance rate, which is what we need to plan for\".\n\nBusiness questions are sometimes used to determine the content for a [Requirements Traceability Matrix](http://www.it-process-maps.com/requirements-management/traceability-matrix/). The output of such a matrix is called a business requirement in SBOMs.", "answer": "B: atlas"}

{"text": "C, because the lizard is not native to new hampshire. It is only native to Utah\n\n### Input.\nA small river runs through a desert. A bird watcher wants to count the number of birds. The bird watcher plans to use a boat to float through the river without getting wet. On the river bank, he sees a small hole in the ground where the birds go to drink. The bird watcher will use the boat and float the bird watching river, counting the number of birds. To determine the number of birds, he will count the number of times that a bird jumps from the hole in the ground to the grass.\n\nWhat is the cost of gasoline to drive along the river to the bird watching river?\n\nRationales: The cost of gasoline to boat along the river is $125,000. When you find the cost of gasoline for the bird watching river, you can find it by taking the total amount of money left after paying for the boat. If it was 125000 - 50000 = 75000 then the cost would be (75000/5) = $<<75000 / 5 = 15000>>15000.\nSo if the gasoline on the bird watching river is $15000 then its $1500/2 so its $<<15000/2=7500>>7500 dollars.\n\n### Input\nTom has 12 blue balls and 12 red balls.

Tom wants to know which bag is red.\n\nHow long would Tom have to do a probability guess at the bag that holds the red ball?\n\nRationalizes: Tom should put all the bags in a line. Now he knows that each red ball can be in the middle or towards the end, but he will need to put the 6 balls in a row. There are 5 bags left to do this in and they will need 2 guesses each to be sure they are not mistaken, so 5 x 2 = <<5 x 2=10>>", "answer": "A: utah"}

{"text": "A: This would be an internet banner ad.\n\n### Input:(1 pt) The average (mean) number of baggage handlers at the airport has been decreasing. Is this good or bad? Choices: Good Bad Neither\n\nNeither: Average is an arithmetic average of two numbers (x + y \u00f7 2) It is possible for the average to decrease in spite of actual numbers changing or increasing.\n\n### Rationales: Mean is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers. Mean does not take into account the quantity of data available. It can be said, for example, if we have two numbers the mean does not care whether the quantity of data is equal. Take two values [5, 9], the resulting mean of 7 is just as likely that the mean would be [9, 3] with a mean of 5.0.\n\n### The same meaning can then be said as follows: the mean is the set of numbers taken together divided by the number of numbers (also referred to as the sum of the numbers). If we have 15 18 then the mean of 1 = 9.\n\nWhat was the mean of the data [5, 9]? This is calculated by calculating 5 + 9 = 14 then 14 divided by 2 = 7.5. This is in error due to the fact that the set is 5 + 9 which would then equal 14. The error is that the mean can only be reached by finding a sum and then dividing by the total. Because 5, 9 cannot be added together the sum of 5 and 9 gives a different number to the mean.\n\n### If we add a quantity that is equal in order to increase the quantity available for the mean, this means that the mean would be closer to the true mean because there would be more numbers to divide. [5, 9, 3] 8.\n\n### For example, if we replace the mean by the word sum, we could add two numbers that give the resultant (5+9)+3 = 16. 16 divided by 3 = 5.67. This is the true mean.\n### This way, in order to get the mean a specific value must be available in the set. If there is only one item in the set,", "answer": "C: store"}

We pick option two. A letter is picked from his mailbox and after that he will have 5 fewer. So in a week, he picks a letter. Next week, he has 9 fewer letters.

If you make a $20 payment at the end of the first month, what is the approximate APR over that 12 months?\n\n### Response\nThe amount that will be added to the current balance depends upon how much of the balance is left. The more that is left, the more additional charge will be applied to the balance.\nA $20 payment is made at the end of the period, which is 1/12th of $20, or $1.66. Assume that the current balance is $100 at the beginning.\nIn the first month, the outstanding balance is $101.66, so the additional charge is $32.83.\nIn one year, the amount that is carried over is $131.49, so the additional charge at the end o the year is $$131.46*(11.4/100) + (131.4/12)(14/100)$$\n$$= $32.86 + $5.67$$\n$$= $38.53$$\n\n#### 38.53\nAnswer: 38.5", "answer": "B: fort knox"}

In this case there are two. CAT - you can make: CAT CATHER CATH  and for a total  of 3 8-letter words using CAT\n\nNow see the number of ways you can combine the words CAT and CATHER, where you will get 3 words but the CATHER word is double counted. So the total number of ways is 3 - 1/x= 2\n \nYou can then write this formula for 8C4, 8*8*8*8.\n\n### Rational:\nFirst count how many ways words can be made from a string. In this case 4.\nNext, see the number of ways a string can be combined with all other combinations of strings. In this case 8*8*4*3.\nThen, you can write the formula to calculate 8C4. There are 8 different ways to choose a string and then there are 4 different ways to arrange them.\n\n### Solution\n8C4 solution of a word is:\n\n8! * (3!/2!) * (2! * 6!) * (3! * 2!)\n\n\nTotal word solution will remain  8 * 3!/2! * 6! * 3! / 2!", "answer": "B: fairgrounds"}

If you began driving from Denver and at the same time the train begins to move, in what city will you be exactly one-third of the way through your drive?\n\n### Rationales:\nTo get one-third we divide it by 3 which is <1/3= <<1/3=0.333>>0.333 or 1/3 is 0.333\nOur starting point is the city we started the drive from and we are going to the city we are one-third of the ways into our drive.  So our next town is <city/3 =<<city/3=0.666>>0.666>.  Then when we get to Los Angeles, 0.334 of the drive was gone, so multiply it by 40<0.666*40=<<0.66640=264>>264 miles.  Then + <0.334 x Los Angeles> <264=L.A.-0.334*L.A.=<<-116>>-116> total mileage to Los Angeles from Denver, which we will find in our google maps or <google maps 264+-116=<<264-116=148>>148.\n\n### Answer:\n**Distance:**   <148 miles>  \n**Description:**   The town of Parker, CO is <148 miles or approx 2.5 hrs> away from Los Angeles, CA\n\n### [https://learn.freecodecamp.org/en/grant/6df", "answer": "C: bible"}

All watermelons are sold by the pound, not by the watermelon. Assume they have watermelons in the store, and that you are buying the watermelon weighing 40 pounds.\n\n### Output and Input:\n### Rationales: This is one task but two input questions. We first have the total cost which is 1.50 x 40 = <<1.50*40=60>>$60 per melon or $2 per square inch of melon.\n\n### 9 $60 = <<60>>$6 times 60 is 360 so that's the cost of a whole watermelon.\nThe second part is when you buy the whole 40-pound melon, you need to cut it into 32 pieces.

He purchased a video game for $19.95. Three days later, he finds that $20 had been taken from his bank account without his consent. Jonathan wants to know if the video game company refunded his money, and he is hoping to figure out who took the money. He has discovered the following transactions in his bank records: On June 9, he transferred $20 to his debit card to pay for the video game. On June 12, he was notified that he had a transaction on his account: the video game company refudneded the $20 transaction. On June 16, he transferred $105 from his savings to his debit card. On June 18, $25 was taken from his debit card. He needs help figuring out the total remaining in his savings account right now. In words, what number equals savings - debit?\n\n### Rationales:\n\nJonthan first transferred $20. From account 20 to account 1952\nThen, that is refunded. From account 1951 to account 0.\nAlso, a new transaction: $105 from account 2 to account 1969.\nAnother new transaction: $25 from account 1968 to account 1975.\nTo find the remaining amount of savings, subtract $0 from our 1975, which is the new amount after the debit, which is $105+(25-573)\nThe remaining amount of savings is our answer.\nIt should be $0 because that is the amount of his savings before he bought the game, and the second to last transaction refunded what was taken out to buy the game.", "answer": "D: chess board"}
{"text": "If you know that B is winning, you should always chose B, C is losing therefore C is a bad choice. The problematic answer is A and E, the first choice is B and the second choice is D, and is therefore incorrect.\n\n### Input\nWe'll call two people competing contestants A and B. We want to know whether contestant A will win the competition. We will use the following rules to determine who the winner will be. If contestant A has played one game more than cont\nestant B, contestant A wins. If contestant A gets only one extra play, contestant B wins. If contestant B gets one more play than contestant A, contestant B wins\n\n\n### Response\n\nThe first step is to figure out the total number of guesses made by both contestants.  Each guess made in the competing game is a move that the contestant makes, which should give them a little edge in the game. If contestant A played one game more than contestant B, then contestant A won the game because they played one extra game in the end and have a total of 2 guesses in the game, and contestant B played only 1 game and has a total of 1 guess in the game.\n\nContestant A will lose to contestant B when contestant A played 1 game more than contestant b, but played 1 game less than contestant B which is 1 more than contestant B which makes 1 guess. Therefore, the game will be broken into two. Contestant A will have 2 games played giving them a total two guesses, and contestant B will have 2 games, giving him a total of 3 guesses.\n\nIn order to determine the winner you have to add the numbers of the total guesses, which will be contestant A : 2 + 2 = 4 + contestant B : 3 = 5\n\nAs seen on the chart below \"if B has + play (1 Guesses)\" is when two players play 1 game extra with each player, the winner is contestant B because the total of their guesses is 5, and contestant A is 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n#### 3\n4 3 Guesses 2 Guesses\n1 2 Guesses  0 Guesses\nA 4 3 Guesses E 2 Guesses", "answer": "C: argument"}

We will write 7x + 5x to represent 12 more than 6x.  Each 5 dollar increase encourages purchase of 2 items, and we need all the encouragement twice, because of the rule, so if 7x + 12 is 170 or more, then the amount must increase by 130, which will be 260.", "answer": "B: center"}

He felt like his feelings where small in comparison to the size of the night sky.\n\n### Input : The average salary for that job was $42,000 per year. If a person who had $22,000 income applied and got the job, she would be making $22,060 each year.

So then the other person who made $60,0 should be making more than $60,0. The salary amount must be over $60,0, with the difference from $22,0 being $38,0.

The prompt is like, \u201cSo the answer to this was, so you have to calculate the conversion for this.\u201d And then the answer is a number. You plug it into the next part to see if your answer is correct. And you see if your answer is wrong, correct, how much it is. The third part is where you see the answer to your questions. It helps you to see how close to the answer you are based on your answer. So the third part can show you the difference between your answer and the answer, if you entered the wrong answer. It can help you know how much better or worse your answer is by your calculation, but it doesn't show it to you if you have the right answer.", "answer": "A: big house"}

He wants to know the date(s) that he saw his first new chicken.\n\n### Questions:\n\n#### 3\n\n### Explanation:\nThe first morning he has 16 chicken, he should have seen 3 chickens (because if 16 = 0 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 0 + 0), he should have seen 1 in total chickens that he counted.\nSecond morning he has 17 chickens, he should have seen chicken, because if 17 = 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1, it shows that the day he saw chicken for first time is 2nd day.\n\nThird morning he has 18 chickens, he didn't see any new chicken, beacause if 18 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 he only see 5 chicks. \nAnd in fifth morning he has 20 chicken (see 1+2+3+1+0) + 2 chickens (see 3+3+1) = 20, he don't see any chicken(because 20 = 0+0)\n\n### Exercises:B)\nA small factory made exactly as many pants as they make shirts. How many shirts were made? Choices: 54 shirts were made or 132 pants were made\nRationales:\n\nIf there were 54 shirtes and 132 pant, that means, that there must have been only 6 pants. So, that means that 54+3 = <<54+3=59>>59 shirts and 10", "answer": "C: surface of earth"}

A house could be built in a bad environment with good weather. The only solution is if they would consider the cost. The house will have to cost too much. I would say that the person on the right has a better argument. He's right in saying a good argument. He is referring to good weather. If its snowing, it might be a problem. The other argument doesn't make much sense though. Cost is a big factor. A house is expensive. If the weather is bad, no one will go inside.\n\n#### Answer:\nI think the second person has a better argument because he knows that a house can be built in a bad weather and it will be still okay.

It costs $220.00 for the iPod, and $99.00 for shipping and tax. How much was the new iPod?\nYou can start by simplifying the problem.\nIt costs $319.00 and you get it for $220 because the iPod's cost is $319 and you get it cheaper!\nYou just have to divide $319 by $220 to find out what the new price is, and you have to multiply tax by shipping to find out how much you paid!\nSo if you're supposed to multiply shipping and tax, then you should multiply them by $220 because you have to multiply the price of $199 by $225 to find out how much tax and shipping are! Then you divide the cost by $220, and then subtract $319 from $319.\n\nThe cost of $319. is equal to $319 and $319 - $319 = 0.\n\n#### 0\nAnswer: 78\n\n##### Response for Explanation:\nWe can see that the cost of $318. is equal to $299 - $299.00, which says 0.

{"text": "The bus was full of people going home after a long day at work.\n\n### Detailed Explanation: The man was trying to take a bus. He states that the bus is full of people going down to a full-size bed. We know this because the bed has two seats. This means that the bus is full. If the bus is full, the only reason a person could sit on the full-size bed would be if the person was going home after work, because it\u2019s bed time. The bed is full up with full-size bodies that would all be sitting. Only after a long day at full time, would one sit.

He looks at the clock, then closes one eye and quickly estimates the time to be 5:30.\n\n### Response 1:\nA: The man estimates 5:30, and then looks again to the clock.\n\n### Explanation: The first thing the man does is close an eye and look at the clock. Then he estimates the time as 5:30 and opens his eye. Then since he looked again he has to be correct.\n\n### Answer 2:\nB: The man closes an eye and estimates the time to be right around 5:30\n\n### Explation: The man closes his eye for about three seconds or twenty four seconds before making his guess. That means he will be off about 40 percent since it is impossible to estimate an exact time to the second. Since his guess was 40 percent higher, it must be the closest choice.\n\n### The answer is B because the man closes one eye to try and estimate a time to be almost 5:30 because the man wants the answer to be 5:00 AMC after 6 the show airs.\n### Input: What", "answer": "A: sitting down"}

A gorge occurs where a river changes direction sharply. But a gorge is not formed from erosion wearing a hole in soft shifting material. If Sam is wrong, what will he call the place? Choices:  D: Plain A: Hill C: Sandplane B: cliff\n\n### Response A\n\n### Input A gorge has high, steep walls and is formed where a river changes direction suddenly. A gorge is not formed by erosion shaping a hole in soft, shifting material. If a gorge is wrong, what will Sam call the area? Choices: C: Sandplain D: Plain E: mountain B: Cliff\n\n### Rationales To decide whether a gorge is right or wrong,  it is important to look at the description. The gorge should have high, steep sides as well as a change in the path of a river.  It should also include a waterfall. If these points are met, then the gorge is appropriate. The gorge formed in a soft, shifting material cannot be formed by erosion. So it cannot possibly be a gorge. It should also not be called a plain because a plain has low, flat land that is not covered in vegetation. The sandplain is flat and dry. The mountain is tallest elevation above land level.\n\n#### 1\nAnswer: A\n\n##  Instruction:\nGrace goes to the doctor.  She's seen Dr. Lewis so many times she calls him by his first name, Joe.

Choices: A B C D E \n\nE\n\n\n### Instructions:\nComplete the following problem.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe 10:0pm showing was on Row L, and there are more available seats in Row B than any other row. So the answer is that the 2:0pm show might be on Row B\n\n### Demination:<br />\nThe first row of the movie theater has the least available seats. So the 2:0 show probably won't be in Row A or the L Row. Therefore, the 2:0 row probably won't be on the bottom floor because there is more available seats on the bottom row than any other row.

Explain your answer.\n\nFor example:\nExplain the difference between \"A\" and \"B\"; \"A is like this\" and \"B is like this.\"\n\nB. Correctness explanation:\nIt is correct to say that someone outgoing will seek for new experiences because, they are likely to become an adventurous person, who is outgoing and fun-loving. They will be the type of person who enjoys life, makes new friends, goes to parties and loves to be with friends. According to some online sources, someone outgoing is an extrovert. It is not true to say that they will be looking for playful people since they are also not playful, and if they are the person will surely get along with them. Outgoing people look for opportunities on the other hand they are also looking for people with whom they can meet for dinner, work and other activities but they will not seek a good person who is playful since they don't like playfulness in the first place. Oppositely, people who are playful have nothing to do with someone outgoing because they are more to be looked at their looks and looks are not part of outgoing people.\n#### 2\nAnswer: A\n\n### Explanation:\nIt's not correct to say someone is looking for beauty since beauty is not outgoing. Also, no one is looking for a person with good looks since they will never be interested in meeting people with good looks. This sentence is also correct because outgoing people do have some adventurous personality and are also looking for a house of their own because they have a lot of friends to house and they enjoy parties.\n#### 6\nAnswer: B\n\n### How to write an excellent explanation and get excellent results:\n\nExplain the differences:\n\nA.

The class Animal contains the properties name and breed. The class Pet is a subclass of Animal. The class Pet contains the properties name, breed, owner, and a property that has a reference to the object that is the owner of the pet. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the name of the animal and its breed. Have the program create five dogs, two cats, one hamster, one snake, and one bird. The program should also prompt the user to enter the owner\u2019s name and have the program display the owner\u2019s name when the application starts. Have the program then create a Pet object from the information entered and display the owner name and pet\u2019s name to the console. Next, the program will prompt the user to choose either an animal or a pet. If the user chooses a pet, then have the program create a pet object, retrieve the owner\u2019s name, and display both names to the console. If the user choose an animal, then have the program access the pet object from the Animal object, using the object instance name. Next, the program prompts the user to input a choice other than animal or pet, and have the program display both names and the message that cannot choose an animal or pet. If the user selects a pet, have the program retrieve the pet object\u2019s owner\u2019s name by using the object instance name, display both names and have the program exit the program.

Guesses are displayed as lowercase characters in the answer area. Guesses are then compared to the hidden word. If there is a match, then the guess is a correct answer to the hidden word. Otherwise, the guess is displayed as a strike next to the guess.\n\n### Display Directions:\nEvery time a guess is made, a prompt is displayed, and the computer asks whether to continue. Once all guesses have been made, the computer displays a winner message if there is a match, or the loser message otherwise. If there is a winner, then a congratulations message and next hidden word option is displayed. If there is a loser, then a try again message is displayed.\n\n### Finished Directions:\nOnce the game is complete, the user can either choose to play a new game, or exit. If the user chooses to play a new game of hide and seek, a new guess is entered and the game starts over.

Which one of the following describes this situation?\n\n### Demorstation:Signing in on time for the flight requires the passenger to be at the airport at least 20 minutes before the scheduled departure time. Your friend arrived soon after you at the airport for the flight. Hence, B\n\n#### B\nB. You are ineligible for any refund because of the new regulations. C. The airline company provides better service to their passengers by providing more room for people who check in early and on time\n\n#### C\nThe situation in question is that of the friends who arrived at the airport late. For the sake of this question, it is being assumed that the friend who arrived late at the airport is trying to book his seat at the last minute, and thus is trying to book a different seat than what they had initially reserved.\n\n#### Answer: B\n\n### Inputs(Part 3): You take a taxi to an airport before your flight is to take off. When you arrive, you discover that you have to wait in line for at least 40 minutes before you are to board your plane. How much would a taxi to the same airport cost for another passenger? (Assume an even length line and a 10-minute wait.)\n\n### Demo:\nThe cost of a taxi is usually based on the distance, and there is also a time factor for waiting in line. If a line is evenly spread out then for each second of delay, there is at least a 5 minute wait, for a total of 10 minutes.(this is assumed based on what has been previously learned regarding queues and waiting)\n\n#### Answer: 10", "answer": "D: city centre"}

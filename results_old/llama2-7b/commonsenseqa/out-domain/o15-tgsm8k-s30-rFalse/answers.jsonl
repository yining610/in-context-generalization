Therefore, in this example the whole is 2, it was 1 and 17.\nSo this is also called a ratio, but also the ratio refers to a 1.5 to 7 ratio as the whole will always be written over \n\n### Input Partial Solution:\nThe ratio of boys to girls was 5:7 then 5,214 children were there how much was the boys get?\n\n##", "answer": "B: heretical"}

{"text": "A: slender\n\n### Discussion point:\nWhat happened?\nIn Part A, the data type of the request was an `input`. The variable input was declared as of type string; that is, any string of characters. There was no preprocessing performed on it.\n\nThere were 8 questions of 4 different types. One was a simple string (input), one was a multiple choice question (instruction), one was a simple math question (demonstration), and one was a multiple choice instruction question (demonstrate).\n\nThe instruction was to read in the request, figure out how to complete it, and then write a response, and when we wrote the response the response was of the variable `answer` of type `response` (an object with `question` as a property whose value is a string of type `question` and `answer` as a property whose type is `answer`).\n\nThere were no errors generated at run time. It worked, with the last instruction.\n\n### Why?\nThere's a function called `readRequest()` that takes in a question and returns a response. This happens by going through the JSON file to find the `question` and the `answer` correspondingly, filling the `question` with the string as written in the file and `answer` by calculating the solution to the equation.\n\nIf the input was empty, an empty string would be pushed into the `response` object.\n\nWhen it reaches the end of the JSON file, `endOfFile` will be assigned `true` so it will break and stop execution.\n\nIf the `response` object is not empty, `responseBuilder()` will build the response in JSON form, converting it into a string.\n\nThis is what is returned to our function:\n\n```\nresponseBuilder();\n```\n\n`answerBuilder()` works by first extracting the `question` property from the `response` object and putting that as a value to a variable `r`.\n\nThen it will use the `r` value as a template to print out a statement like so: `My response is: ` (so in other words the first line in the statement is the variable `r`).\n\nNext, the `answer` property in the response will be put as a value of `answer` variable.\n\nNext, we'll get rid of the first line (`My response is: `)", "answer": "A: slender"}

It has three cabinets: one on the left, one in the middle, and one on the right.  In each cabinet there are 48 plates.  In her closet there are 9 blue shirts, two red shirts, and some yellowish-brown blouses that are kind of a mustard yellow.  Each shirt is made by a different brand. How many different brands of shirts does Maggie have? **Solution:** There are a total of 9 brands of shirrts. One in the 48 plates one in the closet and that leaves 40 others. Since there are two shirts that are not from a particular brand and the closet has some yellow blouses which could either be another shirt or an item that is not a shirt the first number that is not yellow or blue  is not a shirt. The next one that is a color other than yellow or blue has 64,1,1,2,0. It cannot be a shirt since it is not a shirt nor is it a color from plates. From the other column. if it was a shirt, is would be 1 or 0. and from the other column if it was a shirr it would have been 2,4,4, etc. There are no yellowish blouses or yellow so we are just counting the shirts.

Topped slice - this means that there is a combination of cheese, pepperoni and sausage.\n2. Plain slice - this means that it is completely without cheese, pepperono and sausage.\n3. Each slice - this means that each slice is cut equal to 1/8. This is a simple way for making it easy to cut.\n\nI want to make a plain slice to keep for me. This plain slice has 8 slices in total while each slice is 1/8. The whole plain slice will be 8 divided by 1/8.\n\nI want a topped slice to give to my friend. I give the topped slice because it makes 8 divided by 8. This means that every one of my friend will eat 1 slice.\n\nThe correct response is 8 because 8/8 is equal to 1.

It seems that people have almost as many cars as there are people in the city.  We can conclude that people are likely to stand at a red light or at a street corner, rather than at a fork in the road or at the intersection of a city street and a road.  This is because the intersection of a city road and a road with fewer drivers would have more cars on it, and so there would be more likely to be a car or two on the intersecting road to have to cross.  Therefore, a street corner or a red light are better for pedestrians.

This can lead to emotional distress so unless it is absolutely necessary, the details should not be shared.\n\n### Explanation:  The question asks \"What will telling many people?\" It doesn't matter what information is shared, it will potentially lead to an uncomfortable event.  Telling people is the action so what leads to the bad event is telling many people about an event.  Telling one person may not lead to any distress but telling many people may.\n\n### Conclusion:  Embarrassment is not a result of telling people.  It is a result of telling too many people, regardless of the information.\n\n### Input 5: What is the probability of picking a red card from a shuffled deck of 52 playing cards?  Choices:  A. 38% B. 39% C. 42% D. 40% E. 50%\n### Response: B\n\n### Correct answer: 42%\n\n### Examination: 52 cards have 26 reds, not counting Kings, Jacks, and Queens. Since Queens are counted twice, there are 24 red Queens and 24 red Jacks. Since Jacks are counted twice, there is one card with two red queens and one card with two red Jacks. Therefore, out of the 24 red Queens there are 25 cards with two red Queens, so the answer is 42% as red Queens are favored over red Jacks.\n\n### The problem involves selecting a card.  So each card is equally likely to be drawn.\n\n### Rejecting the card is a type of shuffling.\n\n### In a game with 52 cards, the cards are equally likely and the shuffle is random, the correct probability is B.\n\n### If the correct answer is A, then there should be 43.04% red cards.\n\n### 26 red cards = 52 - 26 = 26 non-queen, non-King, non-Jack cards.\n\n## Input", "answer": "B: emotional distress"}

{"text": "The answer options below have one or more correct responses. Choose only ONE option. Use your best judgement as to which option best reflects the correct response. Use the space above to record your response. (Write it in complete thoughts and sentences.)\n\nAn expert speaks to teach something;  an expert speaks to convey some knowledge or wisdom.  These actions involve listening;   listening involves learning;   learning leads to fatigue.\n\nThe speaker may also choose to convey mercy or empathy:  mercy involves sympathy;  empathy involves understanding.  In these cases, listeners may benefit from being merciful or empathetic.\n\nFinally, listeners might be anxious if they are not used to learning from experts and/or are feeling uncomfortable among the crowd.  This anxiety may result in a lack of attention to the speaker, thereby robbing others listening of the fatigue-producing act of learning.  So anxiety, when coupled between the need to learn and the act of fatigue, can lead to empathy and mercy, too.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n_Jonas, a famous doctor, came to speak at an annual conference of the American Medical Association.  After 4 days at the conference, many participants were feeling very anxious (Choice_ B, _above).  The conference began with a group that was highly motivated to learn (Choice_ A, _above) but the act of learning was fatiguing.  Many people became empathetic (Choice_ E, _above),_ and after the fourth day of learning, many people were feeling mercy and began to think kindly about each other (Choice_ D, _above)._", "answer": "A: learning"}

He asks Ben, \u201cDo you think that even numbers that end with 6 are really even?\u201d How can Ben give Jonathan an answer?\n### Response:\nThe answer is that his statement is invalid. Even number are not even if there end with 6.\n\n*Example: 126 is not even\n*Example: 56 is not even\n\nIt is correct that if the last two digit of the number are less than 10, then they are even.\n\nFor a number to be even, it must divide by 2 and the remainder should be 0.\n\n*Example 112 divided by 2 does not have a remainder of 0 (it has a remainder of 1).\n*Example 12 divided by 4 does have a remainder of 2\n\nSo all even numbers except 26,56 are even.\n\n* Example: 96 is even \n*Example: 86 is even\n\n*Example:26 is not even*\n*Example:56 is not even \n\nSo even numbers can end with 6, as long as they have a remainder of 6 when divided by 2\n\n### Challenge Two:\nCreate your challenge and response.

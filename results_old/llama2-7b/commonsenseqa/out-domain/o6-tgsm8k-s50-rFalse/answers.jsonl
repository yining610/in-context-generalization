Where n, m and s are whole numbers between 0 and 3.\n\n### Response Demonstration: There can be multiple ways to create a valid response. However, here is one solution: `4n` must be a number between 0 and 9 inclusive. For each n, there is only one 4n possibility. So for n=1, the 4n possibility (because 1<4n) is 4, so 4n=4, but there is no 4n possibility for n=0. It must have a value (but not a negative one). Therefore the 4n for 1, 2 or 3 is one of 4, 16 or 25. The 19m must also be between 0 and 19 inclusive, but 0<19, so 19m doesn't work. Therefore m must be a number between -2 and 17 inclusive. The following combinations of m result in 19m (m<19) and there only being positive 19m combinations. -2 1 11 17. 4n is a number between 0 (excluding it as that's impossible) and 4, so any combination where n<5. 4n=4 if n=0 and n<4, but none of those are valid values for n.

Give the number sequence and answer and then explain how you got the answer.\n\n`6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,...`\n\n### Answer 2. I started by taking the sequence, `6,7,8,9,10,..., 1`, and I divided by 2.

Finally, if the remainder is 1, I add the value of 3 to 1 and keep doing the operation to get an answer as 9.\n\n### Lastly, I thought that the value of `6,7,...` divided by 2 got the largest number because I need to start to subtract values, so I chose 12.

Nowadays, social media is also an alternative for them to gather information about the world.\n\n\nInput: How were the news stories about the Titanic\u2019s sinking initially described? Answer: A: tragic B: a disaster C: a calamity D: a wreck\n\n### Response\nThere is no single cause of the Titanic sinking. However, some factors have been identified to contribute to the events that had occurred on the Titanic ship that night. According to one article, the main cause were that 1) Titanic\u2019s waterproofed compartments were not fully used, 2) its lifeboats were deemed to be adequate at the time of its departure from England, 3) the ship had not been equipped with enough lifeboats and equipment for lifesaving, and 4) the ship\u2019s lookout staff reported not having sufficient lookouts that night (A Titanic, E1).  Another article identifies two major reasons for the ship sinking: 1) The ship\u2019s crew failed to fully implement the orders on launching all lifeboats when they were still there, and 2) the ship was built to carry 25% more passengers than the number of lifeboats available (A Titanic: History, E2).\n\n\nInput: On what part of the ship did the Titanic sink? Answer: A: its hull B: its superstructure\n\n### Response The Titanic sank at its bottom side, which includes its hull and superstructure. The reason is that it has three compartments which are sealed with watertight, however only one compartment was damaged on the bottom. When this compartment was infiltrated by water, water flowed throughout several compartments and damaged other compartments as it flowed downward. When the other watertight compartments were also damaged and water got in, Titanic sank very quickly (A Titanic Sinking: The Complete Story, E3).\n\n\nInputHow many days passed between the sinking of the Titanic and the delivery of a box of personal effects from first-class passenger Edith Haisman to her husband in Australia?

{"text": "If you look at your shadow from the ground, you will see your shadow cast on the ground directly in front of you. To find your shadows relative position to the surface of the ground, you can use the formula:\n\n`V = H + W`\nWhere V is the distance of your shadow from the surface of the ground (W) in feet (H is the distance of object on which your shadow appears (eg ground))\n\nBecause we want to know the surface of the building (not the ground), our formula will look something like this:\n\n`S = B + L`\n\n`S` = Sides of building (B) inches\n`L` = length of the longest shadow (124 inches)\n\nWith the above formula, the shadow is half way between the front of the building and the length of the shadow. Which is 62 inches from the front of the building.\n\nIf you look at a bridge, the shadows length would not be the same as a building. Since the building has a flat surface, the shadow will remain on only one side of that surface. However, the bridge has uneven surfaces. For this reason, the shadow of a bridge will have multiple surfaces it casts on.\n\n### Input 2: A bridge has 226 feet of length and 1 5/7 feet wide. \nIf it has a support post at every 5 feet, how many support posts are on the bridge?\n\n### Response\nThe bridge is a two-column bridge (the second column is attached at the end of the bridge). There are 226 supports which are 5 feet apart (there are not 5 supports between columns). Therefore the number of supports is 62/1 which is 62.", "answer": "D: ground"}

It had been a long and busy day, so all you wanted to do that day was relax and chill in front of the TV. But after your mom called and said that the house needed to be cleaned, you were at a loss. Even if you were to clean the house from top to bottom, you were still going to have to do school chores when your sister got home. Your mom thought you could clean for half an hour; she told you that after you\u2019d cleaned the house, you could take a 15-minute break, then come back and finish cleaning. That seemed like a great idea, but you had an idea that it would be more efficient if you put away the cleaning products (such as vacuum cleaner, paper towels, cleaning solutions, cloth, mop, etc.) as the house was being cleaned, without cleaning them first. If you put them away when they were used, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about cleaning them again. Then, the house could always be clean at your next visit. Your sister seemed impressed by your idea. She believed that since you could clean the house in such a short time, your 15-minutes-break would be plenty of time to finish school chores.

Then we add 40 to that to get 44.  Richard & Hurley are 44 years apart.  \n\nIn the second problem, we know that each time Pablo reads a page he gets a penny. After reading his books he has 15 pages left to read to save the $15 and have 3 pennies left. He must have read 18 pages \n\nIn the third problem, we know that for the first 15 pages, the cost of the book is $10. Since we are making a difference of 2, we add 2 onto the book fee for it to be divided into 6 people. That would be $30. The 6 people divided it by 2 to get 50 dollars. Now that we have the $500, we take out 50 which means we're left with $450.  Since the total cost for the group is $170 now that Brad is out, he does not need to pay the remaining $30 since he had 1/450.\n\nIn the fourth problem, we're assuming that the $70 paid for all the items. If each gift cost $10 and there were 4 different items, the 60 eggs equaled 60+40+30+20+10 divided by $70 total and multiplied by $60 to get the first five gifts that were $10.  The total number of gifts minus the sixth gift that was $70. The sixth gift was a sixth gift in price, not a number. That's why it's a different number since it is not divided by $70.\n\nIn option e, the total amount of money made by people for eBay is 3000.", "answer": "D: michigan"}

{"text": "A: revealing information\n\n### Input\nIt is December 31, you are 24 years old, and you want to save $1000 for your 45th birthday. Your boss gives you a small raise for your great work and you are now earning $400 per month after taxes. Every year, your investment earns 6% interest compounded monthly and you contribute $150 from your salary every month. The months of January and September cost 0% interest and all other months cost 3% interest. How much money will be in your account on March 1, 2025?\n\n### Response\nThe answer is $2455. If we take one year (48 months) and divide it into 45, we will have 0.9607 years leftover. By subtracting the months with 0% interest, we have 0.91 years left. Then, we multiply the remainder by the interest rate from the leftover months (3%) to get the interest for the remaining months, which is 0.279 years. To solve this in the most simple way, I multiplied 0.91 by 0.008 and I got 0.0784. The annual interest of $185 was divided by 12 and divided by 0.0774 (the number of years). $185 / 0.07574 = $331.22. Then, I multiplied every single amount that I had already given by 0.33, and I subtracted the result from the total ($3240). $3510 - $133 = $3377.23. Lastly, I subtracted the yearly interest ($185 + $45) from the amount ($3412.23). $3412.53 - $364 = $2455\n### Input:Given the following salary schedule, determine the total amount of each type of payment.\n\n### Response-Answer:\n| Age | Salary | \n|-------|----------|\n|10-15|$400| \n|16-20|$", "answer": "D: more funding"}

{"text": "The task asks for the combined age of the two persons 40 years from when they are presently. So the difference in age between the two is 20, which is the answer. What is the number of books Pablo read is a math question where you take the number of books minus 150 and this makes the number of books Pablo has read. Harper has 60 eggs so she uses 10 and 50 to make cakes. In the question, \"how much does each gift cost?\" the correct answer is $10 each. Therefore, the total cost of 60 eggs for gifts is $10 * 20 = $200. To calculate the combined income of the two ladies, divide the entire income by two, add the $200 from the previous question, and then multiply by the percentage of sale which is 70% of $600.

However, there are some missing steps that are needed to perform the problem. The first missing step is the given width length of the rectangle, it is not provided by the solution so there isn't a way to measure. Without the width measurement there isn't a accurate way to know what the area is or the height of the rectangle.

In my senior year of high school, I took AP Computer Science: Principles with Mr. Smith who is still my favorite teacher to this day (he will get mentioned very soon).\n\nAt the time I didn't know what career I wanted to pursue, but Mr. Smith inspired me to learn about coding and what it could do for the world. The next year I met Dr. Schaffer and Mr. Vosshall, who are the two mentors who helped me get where I am today.\n\nI applied to the CIT program as it seemed fun at the time, so I had no idea that this would later help me start the path to get to where I wanted to be.\n\nLearning to code was both scary and exciting. As a junior and senior, I took Java (CS) as a course. I had a blast at first because it was a lot of fun learning how to program something from scratch. As time went on, I was able to write applications that I would actually use in real life and make games with GameMaker.\n\nThis program and all the mentors I had helped me learn two very important things: first, I can do a lot of things when I focus and give it my all, even in the most difficult situations, and second I need to take the time to explain things, teach others and build something that I'm proud to say I built.\n\nWhen I started doing my sophomore and junior internships, it really clicked with me that this is what I wanted to do.

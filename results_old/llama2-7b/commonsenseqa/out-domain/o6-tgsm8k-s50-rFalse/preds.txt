Choices:  A: excitement B: fatigue C: anger D: hurting E: getting tired<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Instructor:<n>* **The correct response to this question is C.**<n>* It's great that you identified that the choices were opposite, however you still need to recognize which answer corresponds to which question. If Hurley is Richard's age 20 years from now, Richard would have to be 40 now.<n><n>* The question here involves addition and subtraction which both involve numbers. Hurley is 100 away from 140. In addition, Richard is older than Hurley and we also know that Hurley is 18 (older than teenagers).<n><n>* From the question, it seems like all the friends have had 815 days of reading. From there, 815 = 6 * 20 and we subtract 815 - 6 * 2o to get the number of books.<n><n>* The correct answer to this one is A.<n><n>* The car wash only takes out 10% of the money, the group has $100, and they have a total cost of $1700.<n><n>* The teacher appreciation gifts cost $6. The cost of 1 egg would be $0.15*6 to get a cost of $0.90 per egg.<n><n>* There's not enough information to answer this one.<n><n>* Excellent! The friends made $600 by using eBay. And their friend Aurelia made $420 by using eBaay.

Choices:  A: orchestra B: baritone woodwind sound C: symphony D: play music E: high school band<n><n>### Response:		I think it may be choice "E": it would be a high school band that sounds unpleasant to listeners because it is high school band playing. Another possible answer is choice "D". A symphony would be unpleasing to listeners if it was made by someone who doesn't know the proper way to make symphonies. Finally, a baritone woodwind sounds unpleasing when it's bad, but also when the baritone woodwind is played a little. It all really depends on the person playing it and how they sound. For example, if one person played the baritone wood on key, it'd sound more pleasant.  Choices "B" and "C" were probably not chosen because they could be answered by students who don't think music sounds pleasant when it's not made by professionals or when it's not played on a good instrument.<n><n><n>### Input<n><n>How much money would you get to keep after purchasing tickets to see a musical, spending $600 for the tickets and spending $80 for dinner?<n><n>### Response<n>If we are going to use the musical ticket expense in the calculations, I would expect to only spend $880.25 ($600 + $22.77 for tax and $80 +$1.26 for tip). According to the question as stated, we should receive $157.75.<n>If the $600 are for the actual cost of the tickets only (and not the costs of tax and tip), I would expect to only receive $918.25 ($626+$192).<n>

Where n, m and s are whole numbers between 0 and 3.<n><n>### Response Demonstration: There can be multiple ways to create a valid response. However, here is one solution: `4n` must be a number between 0 and 9 inclusive. For each n, there is only one 4n possibility. So for n=1, the 4n possibility (because 1<4n) is 4, so 4n=4, but there is no 4n possibility for n=0. It must have a value (but not a negative one). Therefore the 4n for 1, 2 or 3 is one of 4, 16 or 25. The 19m must also be between 0 and 19 inclusive, but 0<19, so 19m doesn't work. Therefore m must be a number between -2 and 17 inclusive. The following combinations of m result in 19m (m<19) and there only being positive 19m combinations. -2 1 11 17. 4n is a number between 0 (excluding it as that's impossible) and 4, so any combination where n<5. 4n=4 if n=0 and n<4, but none of those are valid values for n. If n=1 the valid 4n combinations are

Then 8^2=64. Therefore, the product of a 4 digit number by a 3 digit number is 85(4,8,5).<n><n>### Input and Response:<n><n>Input: Your friend borrowed some money from a bank. They borrowed an amount that was 2 times a certain amount, but then they added more to that total. The grand total was the amount of $12.83. Calculate which amount was borrowed the first time, the amount that was added, and the amount that was returned. <n><n>Response: Input : (2n) + (5) Output : n + 5 Input : (2n * 3) - a + b Output : (2n * (3 - a) * (2 * b - 1)) Input: You borrowed $50. You return a certain amount of $2 with an additional $5

What number would you add to 1 to make it equal to 5? You could add two 1s to make it equal to five, or you could add 12. If you take that number and multiply it by 2, you get 22. What is that divisible by 3?<n>```<n><n>### Answer: 2.<n><n>### How would you approach this problem? What would be your first attempt?<n><n>### Firstly, I had to divide every item(5, 10... 20) by 2 and add 2, then I add 2 to the answer.<n><n>### What is the value of the divisor for this number sequence?  Give the number sequence and answer and then explain how you got the answer.<n><n>`6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,...`<n><n>### Answer 2. I started by taking the sequence, `6,7,8,9,10,..., 1`, and I divided by 2. After that, I took the remainder and added 2 to get 0. Then I multiply that by `2`, and divide by 3. Finally, if the remainder is 1, I add the value of 3 to 1 and keep doing the operation to get an answer as 9.<n><n>### Lastly, I thought that the value of `6,7,...` divided by 2 got the largest number because I need to start to subtract values, so I chose 12. Then, I took the remainder, adding 2 to it, dividing by 3 and adding 3 to the answer I got. Next, I subtracted 3, and used the value as a divisor. Finally, I subtracted the value.<n>It was correct.<n><n>### The following is a question where you have to reverse the order of the numbers in a number sequence.<n><n>### 10...25,12,17...<n><n>### 6...23,16...<n><n>### The first number

Choices:  A: reverse B: backwards C: back and D: back and E: tally back<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: A common saying, Sam thought was, go forth.<n><n>Output: The correct answer is D, "tally back".  Tally back is a mathematical operation of reversing a number to get the original number. It can represent an iterative process to generate the same number over and over.<n><n>### Inputs:<n>A is incorrect because go forth is grammatically incorrect as a common saying.<n>B is incorrect because back and forth is not a common saying.<n>C is incorrect because a tally, the process of tallying is not an action.<n>E is incorrect because you don't tally the back.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>D is the correct answer because go forth is backwards, and the second part of the mathematical operation tallying backwards.<n><n>### Other Explanation:<n>Choices: A Back B back and forth C tally back D Tally forward<n><n>### Examples<n>```<n>Inputs:<n>- A: back and forth<n>- B: back<n>- C: back and D Tally forward<n>Outputs:<n>- A is incorrect because the expression back and forth is not an iterative process. You first have to use the back function and then use the forward function in the iterative process.<n>- B is the correct answer because the back function is just a mathematical operation, so it only goes one way. It does not go back because it reverses to the original number.<n>- C is incorrect because you do not tally the back part of the mathematical operation.<n>- D is incorrect because it is the iterative process that reverses a number and the same number is used in an iterative process. Tallying is only a method of displaying the reverse of a number.<n>```<n><n>### Instructions:<n>### Find the percent of change of the numbers and multiply them together.<n>### Find the difference in years and then subtract the two different numbers of years in cents.<n>### Find number of books read by adding all the pages in the books and divide by 150.<n>### Find two numbers that sum to the number of children the two friends have.

Answer: A: tragic B: a disaster C: a calamity D: a wreck<n><n>### Response<n>There is no single cause of the Titanic sinking. However, some factors have been identified to contribute to the events that had occurred on the Titanic ship that night. According to one article, the main cause were that 1) Titanic’s waterproofed compartments were not fully used, 2) its lifeboats were deemed to be adequate at the time of its departure from England, 3) the ship had not been equipped with enough lifeboats and equipment for lifesaving, and 4) the ship’s lookout staff reported not having sufficient lookouts that night (A Titanic, E1).  Another article identifies two major reasons for the ship sinking: 1) The ship’s crew failed to fully implement the orders on launching all lifeboats when they were still there, and 2) the ship was built to carry 25% more passengers than the number of lifeboats available (A Titanic: History, E2).<n><n><n>Input: On what part of the ship did the Titanic sink? Answer: A: its hull B: its superstructure<n><n>### Response The Titanic sank at its bottom side, which includes its hull and superstructure. The reason is that it has three compartments which are sealed with watertight, however only one compartment was damaged on the bottom. When this compartment was infiltrated by water, water flowed throughout several compartments and damaged other compartments as it flowed downward. When the other watertight compartments were also damaged and water got in, Titanic sank very quickly (A Titanic Sinking: The Complete Story, E3).<n><n><n>InputHow many days passed between the sinking of the Titanic and the delivery of a box of personal effects from first-class passenger Edith Haisman to her husband in Australia? Answer: A: two days B:

Choices:  A: suface of moon B: building C: bridge D: ground E: bright light<n><n>### Response:		<n>If you look at your shadow from the ground, you will see your shadow cast on the ground directly in front of you. To find your shadows relative position to the surface of the ground, you can use the formula:<n><n>`V = H + W`<n>Where V is the distance of your shadow from the surface of the ground (W) in feet (H is the distance of object on which your shadow appears (eg ground))<n><n>Because we want to know the surface of the building (not the ground), our formula will look something like this:<n><n>`S = B + L`<n><n>`S` = Sides of building (B) inches<n>`L` = length of the longest shadow (124 inches)<n><n>With the above formula, the shadow is half way between the front of the building and the length of the shadow. Which is 62 inches from the front of the building.<n><n>If you look at a bridge, the shadows length would not be the same as a building. Since the building has a flat surface, the shadow will remain on only one side of that surface. However, the bridge has uneven surfaces. For this reason, the shadow of a bridge will have multiple surfaces it casts on.<n><n>### Input 2: A bridge has 226 feet of length and 1 5/7 feet wide. <n>If it has a support post at every 5 feet, how many support posts are on the bridge?<n><n>### Response<n>The bridge is a two-column bridge (the second column is attached at the end of the bridge). There are 226 supports which are 5 feet apart (there are not 5 supports between columns). Therefore the number of supports is 62/1 which is 62.<n>

Check batteries for power (is the indicator light on?). Replace batteries and test again. If the batteries are good, check the connection (plug in the electrical item and test for power). If the electrical equipment will not power on, what connection is the next thing to check?<n><n>### Output Explanation:<n>B) The next thing to check is the telephone network. Use a phone to call someone; if the call is not answered, check the phones or the jack on the wall.<n><n>### Input and Output explanation:<n>C) Check the circuit breakers. If one of the circuit breakers flips when power is first turned on, it can cause the equipment to stop.<n><n>### If this connection is powered, what’s next?<n>D) If the power isn’t working in one device, it can mean that there’s something wrong with the freeway. Check the freeway for a problem.<n><n>### Output explanation: (E) If checking the power is not effective, it could be the airport. The airport controls the power and is connected to the other places.<n><n>### In your own words:<n>When a device doesn't work, check the connection (if it works, it isn't the connection) and if it doesn't work, it's a different connection (freeway, airport, telephone network). If the device is still broken after that, the power is bad and so is the wires (circuit breakers).<n><n>### Question:<n>What were you not able to do with this task?<n><n>I was not able to get the prompt correct (the explanation was not the output).<n><n>### Feedback:<n>I have added the instructions; they were deleted before.<n><n>### Challenging Problems (optional):<n>- Input: 50 students were in a school club for 1 month.

Choices:  A: curiosity B: excitement C: boredom D: wonder E: fear<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>### Instructions:You are required to respond to this scenario and the associated two questions.<n><n>### Scenario:It was 2:00 PM when you picked up your little sister from school to go home. It had been a long and busy day, so all you wanted to do that day was relax and chill in front of the TV. But after your mom called and said that the house needed to be cleaned, you were at a loss. Even if you were to clean the house from top to bottom, you were still going to have to do school chores when your sister got home. Your mom thought you could clean for half an hour; she told you that after you’d cleaned the house, you could take a 15-minute break, then come back and finish cleaning. That seemed like a great idea, but you had an idea that it would be more efficient if you put away the cleaning products (such as vacuum cleaner, paper towels, cleaning solutions, cloth, mop, etc.) as the house was being cleaned, without cleaning them first. If you put them away when they were used, you wouldn’t have to worry about cleaning them again. Then, the house could always be clean at your next visit. Your sister seemed impressed by your idea. She believed that since you could clean the house in such a short time, your 15-minutes-break would be plenty of time to finish school chores. But your mom had another problem: one of your sister’s friends wanted to stay over and she knew you were probably busy. So, how did you organize the cleaning?<n><n>### Questions:<n>1.If it took twice as long to clean an area as it did to prepare it (e.g. it took 5 minutes to set out supplies for a cleaning session and 10 minutes to clean), then how long would it take to clean the whole house?<n><n>### You can use variables if needed.<n><n>### Response<n><n>### Instructio<n><n>1.If you had to run 10 kms around the school, how to do it in the least time possible?<n><n>### Response

Where is James? Choices:  A: dairy farm B: texas C: building D: michigan E: florida<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Why?:dairy farm<n><n><n><n><n><n>### Demostration<n><n>In the first problem, we know that the difference in ages between Richard & Hurley is 2. We take that and double it to get 4. Then we add 40 to that to get 44.  Richard & Hurley are 44 years apart.  <n><n>In the second problem, we know that each time Pablo reads a page he gets a penny. After reading his books he has 15 pages left to read to save the $15 and have 3 pennies left. He must have read 18 pages <n><n>In the third problem, we know that for the first 15 pages, the cost of the book is $10. Since we are making a difference of 2, we add 2 onto the book fee for it to be divided into 6 people. That would be $30. The 6 people divided it by 2 to get 50 dollars. Now that we have the $500, we take out 50 which means we're left with $450.  Since the total cost for the group is $170 now that Brad is out, he does not need to pay the remaining $30 since he had 1/450.<n><n>In the fourth problem, we're assuming that the $70 paid for all the items. If each gift cost $10 and there were 4 different items, the 60 eggs equaled 60+40+30+20+10 divided by $70 total and multiplied by $60 to get the first five gifts that were $10.  The total number of gifts minus the sixth gift that was $70. The sixth gift was a sixth gift in price, not a number. That's why it's a different number since it is not divided by $70.<n><n>In option e, the total amount of money made by people for eBay is 3000.

Choices:  A: revealing information B: being ridiculed C: problems D: more funding E: telling all<n><n>### Response:		A: revealing information<n><n>### Input<n>It is December 31, you are 24 years old, and you want to save $1000 for your 45th birthday. Your boss gives you a small raise for your great work and you are now earning $400 per month after taxes. Every year, your investment earns 6% interest compounded monthly and you contribute $150 from your salary every month. The months of January and September cost 0% interest and all other months cost 3% interest. How much money will be in your account on March 1, 2025?<n><n>### Response<n>The answer is $2455. If we take one year (48 months) and divide it into 45, we will have 0.9607 years leftover. By subtracting the months with 0% interest, we have 0.91 years left. Then, we multiply the remainder by the interest rate from the leftover months (3%) to get the interest for the remaining months, which is 0.279 years. To solve this in the most simple way, I multiplied 0.91 by 0.008 and I got 0.0784. The annual interest of $185 was divided by 12 and divided by 0.0774 (the number of years). $185 / 0.07574 = $331.22. Then, I multiplied every single amount that I had already given by 0.33, and I subtracted the result from the total ($3240). $3510 - $133 = $3377.23. Lastly, I subtracted the yearly interest ($185 + $45) from the amount ($3412.23). $3412.53 - $364 = $2455<n>### Input:Given the following salary schedule, determine the total amount of each type of payment.<n><n>### Response-Answer:<n>| Age | Salary | <n>|-------|----------|<n>|10-15|$400| <n>|16-20|$

The grocery store would be the best choice because it contains many products that would be useful in the future, especially food. But the medicine cabinet would be a good choice and not the kitchen. The kitchen would only give you kitchen utensils. The medicine chest would also only give you medicine supplies.

Choices:  A: intelligence B: education C: effectiveness D: distress E: a stupid<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The task asks for the combined age of the two persons 40 years from when they are presently. So the difference in age between the two is 20, which is the answer. What is the number of books Pablo read is a math question where you take the number of books minus 150 and this makes the number of books Pablo has read. Harper has 60 eggs so she uses 10 and 50 to make cakes. In the question, "how much does each gift cost?" the correct answer is $10 each. Therefore, the total cost of 60 eggs for gifts is $10 * 20 = $200. To calculate the combined income of the two ladies, divide the entire income by two, add the $200 from the previous question, and then multiply by the percentage of sale which is 70% of $600. There is a word that is asked and the given choices are A: intelligence, B: education, C: effectiveness, D: distress, and E: a stupid. Choice E: a stupid is the correct word.<n><n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following true/false question.<n><n>## Demonstration:The task asks if the given scenario is false.

After decorating the room, they decided to go to the park. They were the first ones there so they had a lot of fun enjoying the park before other people arrived on the scene. <n><n>### The park was filled with people when they returned

Choices:  A: roof B: school C: beach D: closet E: garage<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Why:The chair has to be put away in a location that is not intended to be used when it’s not needed. Doorways are meant to hold items that are often used, such as groceries. School is an area for learning. The beach and the closet are places to play or relax, and the garage is for the car. Therefore, the chair should be put in the school.<n><n>### Input 2:Alice likes to solve puzzles. Whenever she sees a puzzle, she purchases several puzzle books containing 500 different puzzles to solve. She solved 800 puzzles in 8 puzzle books. If she solved 600 puzzles in her last 8 puzzle books, how many books did Alice have to have to total 800 puzzle books?<n><n>### Response 2:B<n><n>### Why 2:When Alice bought puzzle books, there was no total amount of puzzle books. She would have to buy at least one puzzle book to start her puzzle book collection. Alice did not have to have any more than 3 puzzle books to solve 800 puzzling books. She solves 800 puzzels if she has 37 puzzle books. The total amount of books and puzzles that Alice has to have is 37 + 600 = 637. Alice will have to have at least 637 puzzle books to solve all of them once.

The rabbi will also lead a sermon during the service, which is done by reading from the Old or New Testament. The rabbi will be seated in a chair and wearing a coat or cloak to show that he is an important person.

A rest area is not a place with grass and an area to sell things at a roadside stand...so that is also incorrect. A park, like a state park has grass so that also isn't correct.  A rest area has no grass at all and definitely isn't a place to use to get things to sell at roadside stands.  The correct answer is E, the garden.  A garden has no grass, no super markets and definitely not rest areas so it is the place to use to get the things to sell.

Choices:  A: mouth B: can C: human D: snake E: kentucky fried chicken<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer to this question is option A, "mouth." According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary and various other dictionaries, the root of the term "lip" shares the same meaning between animals, plants, the word "fat," and even slang or other dialect. For example, the slang term "lip" can be found in the Merriam-Webstere Dictionary, which is not considered in the following search:<n>```<n>> grep "mouth" * | wc -l<n>12<n>```<n>A more technical definition of the word "lip" is found in the Oxford Dictionary (found in the below link):<n>```<n>> grep -iw "lip" * | grep "living" | wc -l <n>66<n>```<n>When examining the first definition, there are many choices that are not living creatures. Here's another example,<n>```<n>> grep lippy * | grep "lives" | wc -l<n>826<n>```<n>All animals, plants, fungi, protozoans, and bacteria would have "lip" in their name. Another way of searching through different dictionaries is to search the words with the stem "animal".<n>```<n>> grep animal * | grep "-er" | wc -l  <n>1030<n>```<n>After doing this, the definition of "lip" in the English dictionary would be a lot more familiar.<n>

Choices:  A: dicks sporting goods B: sporting event C: mall D: sears E: sporting goods store<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>D:<n><n>If one says, 'dicks sporting goods', the one should make an assumption that the question refers to sporting goods stores - not some other sort of 'dick' (e.g. penis) or 'dick' (an intransitive verb that means to cause something or someone to become stupid).   When making an assumption and answering a question, one should use the first piece of information and logic to answer the question.  If there are multiple items that can be chosen, the one should only consider the first (first in mind, first in answer).  It would be bad if an answer used B and C above (but not necessarily C).  B would be a terrible choice because it is unlikely that sports equipment needs would be at a sports event.  <n>It would be better if the one used some sort of explanation in their answer. In the case of the one's friend, 'How much time did the one spend at Dick's?' or 'How often does her friend buy sports equipment'. It should be relevant to the time she spent there.<n><n>### Output:Which one, if any, would most likely be considered a'sore loser'?

What if the answer is also no or not at all?<n>I recommend that the one makes the question more clear by either editing it to be more clear or by asking the person the question a simpler question. <n><n>### Output<n>Which item would earn the most money at a yard sale?

Choices:  A: stand B: go quickly C: walking D: stand still E: walk slowly<n><n>### Response:		The man could only move by walking.<n><n>### Input The following information applies to questions 2 and 3.<n><n>Two cars meet head first at the top of a hill.<n><n>Each car starts to descend the hill.<n><n>The car A descends more quickly than car B.<n><n>Their descending speeds are in the ratio of 2:1.<n><n>After 2 minutes, the car B catches up with car A.<n><n>After they meet, the cars start to move away from each other.<n><n>Their distances are in the ratio of \(2\sqrt[2]{15}:1\).<n><n>Car A passes car B after 8 minutes.<n><n>Answer the following questions independently:<n><n><n>### Question 2: The average amount of water left on the planet is 600 km3.<n>The rate at which water evaporates is \(20\sqrt{2}\) km3 per hour. If the ocean is 781,000 km3, approximately how long will it last if water evaporates at this rate?<n><n>Answer: 5,856.5676381 hours.<n><n><n>### Reason:<n>If the rate of evaporation is `20.sqrt(2)`, then the ocean will evaporate in `ln(20)*sqrt(2) = 28.034811117` hours or about 5623 minutes or 97 hours. If the total distance is `781,029.759` km\^3, then the ocean is about 96.9983960177032% full. The answer is that it will last about 5622 hours, 120 minutes, 16 seconds or 6004357.57056931 seconds before the ocean evapotrates completely.<n><n>### Question:How many times faster does the other car have to catch up than its original speed to catch up within the hour? Answer: The rate of acceleration of car B is `2sqrt(2)/3.21359375` km/min which is faster than the descent speed of car A by `(2sqrt2)/sqrt2 = 4:1`. Thus

There isn't enough room to have the 60 dollars and the $320 she would have if she were to evenly divide the coins into quarters and pennys. However, she already has $300 and $800, more than enough to cover the money she has in banks for a $320 quarters. This would mean she would still have $40 left, or a $5

The last thing you have to do is change one of the x values into mx value. Since this is in mx, you would have mx into 1. You would have 1.2.

The point with the example is that the dog was inside rather than outside.\n- I know that dogs often feel like they have all the space in the room or house that they are living in if they only go in one room, this is why I choose option \u201cD\u201d because it makes sense that in a small apartment the dog feels this way, even though he/she may be indoors.\n- If the dog was outside in the dog park then it seems to have more space and room to walk and play than if it were just inside of a small apartment.\n- If this were a dog in the living room then, it seems like it would only feel like having all the space it needed if another dog came to sit with it, as the living room isn\u2019t a place where you can fully be by yourself.\n\n### Answer Choice E\n- Although the dog is only in the living room, and not the entire house, the dog still feels like it has all the room in the world to walk around. The dog doesn\u2019t feel like it is limited to that space at all as it has to share the space with no one, so it is more like the dog\u2019s personal space", "answer": "E: big house"}

{"text": "C is correct because synagogue is more of a religious place where people sit for prayer\n\n### Rationales: Synagogues are used as places of worship for Jewish followers. A large meeting hall is known as a synagogue. Prayers are held in this location, and a large number of individuals gather to worship together. This suggests that synagogues are frequently occupied. Synagogues, on the other hand, are not restricted to one particular religion. A synagogue is not only used by Jewish followers of religion; rather, it is widely used. This means that not only do Jewish people use the synagogue, but also people of other religions, and thus a large number of people may be seen sitting in a synagogue. Thus, the answer is C.\n\n### Input(Demonstration): What type of rock do people use the most for jewelry in North American and European style clothing?

The list price of one of those items should be doubled. You should also sell two of your five items separately. Give each customer a maximum of 10% off each separate item. Finally a customer wants to buy one of your items at about 40% off the list price. What should you do?\n\n### Rationales:\nGiven that a customer wants to buy at about 40 % discount, I would give it to her and take a discounted loss. \nThen I can sell the other items to another customer at list price for a 10% discount. \nMy final net profit would be from that one item at a 30% discount.\n#### 5 * 2 - 3 = 260.\nThe result is a negative number since the customers got a discount.\nI would have a negative 260, in this case, if a customer paid only 204 dollars. Then I could still gain profit. \nIf the customer decided not to buy, I would lose negative 260 in profit. If the customer got the 40% discount it would be 204 dollars, and I would not lose anything.\n\n### Input :You don't need to come early to get ahead.

The heart pumps between 5 and 6 quarts (about 5 liters) of blood every day. The pressure of your blood pushing against the walls of your blood vessels keeps you alive. The heart has four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. The left side of the heart performs one job: to supply blood to the lungs, and the right side of the heart performs two jobs: to receive oxygen-poor blood from the body and to send oxygen-rich blood to the body. The right side of the heart has 2 chambers: right atrium and right ventricle. During each heartbeat or pump, the right atrium sends blood to the right ventricle, which pumps blood through the pulmonary artery, to the lungs (to let the red blood cells absorb oxygen). The left atrium receives slightly beutier blood from the lungs, fills the left ventricle, which delivers the blood through the left pulmonary artery through the aorta, around the body.The heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that travel in a special pathway called the electrical conduction system that starts in the sinoatrial node in the right atrium. These impulses travel through the atria to the AV node, then to the Bundle of His and finally to the ventricles. After each contraction, the heart relaxes and refills the heart chambers, forming another contraction.\n\n#### 1.\tWhy are Mary\u2019s ears ringing?\n\n### Rationales : Mary ear is ringing because she is deaf and dumb.\n\n#### 2.\tTrue or false: Your heart beats", "answer": "C: money"}

The remaining 3/5 = <<3/5*3=1.5>> 1.5 meters is not enough to hold the tree up.\n\nThe tree is now <<2/5*0.6=0.4>> 0.4 meters.  It can be considered collapsed.  It is now unstable because it will not hold itself up.\n\nTherefore, it has to be cut down.\n\n#### 1.8\n\nAnswer: 1.8 meters.\n\n### Input :Why would someone not want to compete in cross-country races with a team of professional athletes?\n\n<p>Choices: A: The cross country race is not fun B: Professionals are faster C: Professionals are stronger D: Professionals are slower E: They will not all fit.\n\n### Answer: D\n\n### Instuctions:Answer the following question.\n\n## Rational:\n<p>Professionals are the best at their sport and are expected to be the most athletic and fastest.

{"text": "C\n\n### Detailed Explanation of why C is the correct answer:\nThis question was a multiple choice question, so I knew there could only be 1 single correct answer. From the choices, I know that A, H, and D are incorrect. As for B, it seemed like the safest choice for the question, as the answer mentioned events, and malls were probably not the safest. For E, it didn't mention a \"store\", and sears doesn't specifically mention \"sporting equipment\", so I eliminated that from the choices. This meant it was more than likely to be either choices A or D. From the options shown, I noted that B mentioned sporting and that was what led me to guess C.\n\n### Input : What is the next number in the series?\n3, 9, 27, 81,?\n\n### Response : 243\n\n### Dated Explanation of why the answer is correct:\nAccording to the question, a sequence that is given are 0 3 0 3 in a sequence of 0 3 3 0 0. Therefore the next number should be 3. The pattern seems to be going for even sequences on odd numbers and odd sequences on even numbers. The number 3 fits into this sequence, just with the wrong numbers. Therefore the next number on this sequence, should have been a number that is a pattern of 27. This would then mean that the answer should be 243.\n\n### Output:How many minutes are in 15?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: How many minutes are in 48?\nRationales in the demo are not important, since this is a multiple choice question\n\nThe question is asking for the number of minutes in 48, which means that the answer is 48 / 60 which equals <<48/60=0.8>>0.8 minutes.

Conversely, the grocery store does not sell animals; it only sells and packages them for people intending to feed their animals in their own houses at home. Therefore, the cows will just roam and wander about the countryside peacefully.

{"text": "The answer is D) sameness.\n\n### Explanation:\nWe expect to find the word \"same\" in the definition. We can substitute values anywhere between two numbers.\nIf you go from 2 to 4, their sum will be 6, their difference will be 4.\nIf you go between 8 to 10, their sum will be the same as their difference.\nThis relationship is true any time we start with one number and go to another number.\nAnswer B is likeness. There is no word for likeness in the given definition.\nWe can't say \"more alike\".\nAnswer C is alike. There is no word that states the whole range between 1 and 4 is alike.\n\n### Bonus Input:\nWhat does the term <i>\"the number of things differing from the first\"</i> mean in the above definition?\n\n### Bonuses Explanation:\nAnswer A: Difference.

{"text": "E\n\n### Demostration:It is possible that all of the choices except for E might be delayed. Since this choice is specific to where all the delays occur, the choice is E.\n\n### Explanation:There could be a variety of delays due to the amount of people or other scenarios.\n\nHowever, it is specified that there weren't enough seats, so the choice is specific to where there is a delay. It is impossible to delay the bookstores, as they obviously weren't the places that needed it. It's equally impossible to delay the office, meeting or coffee house, as everything else is listed before it. So what is left? The building, and we can now easily eliminate everything but for the building. From there, it's not about what we cannot delay, it's about what we can.\n\nAs we can tell from the choices there are also only two choices left, so no other two need to be combined (the building, the meeting place, etc.). If we combine the building and the coffee house, we can eliminate the coffee house from being the choice that is delayed. From here we can cross-out all the other options, leaving us with only the building, and it is now clear choice E is the only option.\n\n**What happened?**\n\n**Eliminations**\n\n**2**  \nA, B, C\n\n**1**  \nE\n\n![](https://github.com/MatthewWW/LyndaCoursesFall2020/blob/master/LearningProjects/MachineLearningforHumanity/2020-10-11%2016.10.19.png?raw=true)\n\n\n### Excluding the second option and going with the first, there is only one option left for the 4th one as well now, and only 4 options left as a whole.\n\n**5**  \nD\n\n**4**  \nE", "answer": "C: meeting"}

The remaining piece was 8 inches in height and was 8/8 inches in width, which is 1 inch.\n\n#### 1\nAnswer: 1\n\n### Instructions:Write a response that appropriately solves the problem.\n\n### Input\n\nGiven the number of cats, each person in a class of 5 people has $100 in dollars, how much is each person in the class have in cats?\n\n### Response\n\nInput: Each person in a class has spent $100 on cats.

{"text": "#### Explanation:\nRationales: Concertos can be heard in many types of music.\n\n**An orchestra plays many instruments like violins (violins can sing), violas (violas can sing), cellos (cello can sing), bassoons, brass instruments (trumpets, French horns, tubas), percussion instruments (keyboards, drums, guitars)**, and harpsicord. A cello is a type of bass. A harpsicord is a type of piano. Most types of classical orchestras are full of various types of instruments, just like the 1st orchestra I saw. \n\n**A jazz band may play a concerto.**\n\nIt's also possible to play a concerto with an orchestra.\n\n**Rock bands and music store groups don't play much music**. It's harder to play with that many people at once, compared with an orchestra. It might be harder to play music with all 17 people at once **because the music might go out of sync** when a rock band is playing something loud. It would take a lot of **rehearsing** to make sure everyone could play this music at once in sync with each other, since there's a lot of **drums** in a rock band. \n\n#### 32\nAnswer:\nOrchestra\nC: Jazz band\nB: Orchestras can play different types of music,  but they play lots of instruments.

What is her birthday?\n\n### Response2:\nThe 16\n\n### Rationales2:\nSonja was the youngest of all of the babies born in her hospital. That means that her birthday was after all of the other youngest birthdays. In order for her to be on the 16th, she needs to be the youngest of everyone up to, but not including, the 16th.\nWe can think of her birthday as a race of babies, where everyone is a candidate for best birthday. If she is going for the 16th birthday, then she has to be younger than everyone else, which means that her race time for the 16 is:\n<code> (16 - her race time) = 16 -? = 16 - time = (16 - time) </code>\nGiven that she is the youngest of all babies born today, we know that her race time is <code>0</code>. Therefore, her race time for the <code>16</code> is <code>>0=16</code>, which means:\n<code>>16=17</code>\nThe question becomes which baby was named <code>>16 = 17</code>? That baby would be the one who was born on the 17th, which is Sonja. Therefore:\n<code>> 16 = 16 - (17)</code>\nWhich evaluates to \"<code>>0 - 17 =0</code>\"\n\n<code>(16 - 17 = 0)</code>\n#### 0\nAnswer: 0", "answer": "E: eat plants"}

A logical response is given here because the handbags are illegal/illegitimate by definition. _Illegal_ + _handbags_ = _illegitimate_. Therefore, they must have a _legitimacy statement_(which is illogical). If the bags are legitimate, the statement would be logically sound.\n- It can be seen that the term _illegal_ and _logical_ are synonymous.\n- If the handbags are legitimate or _legal_ the item could be returned.

She used 3 large pencils, 7 big pencils, 6 small pencils, 5 very small pencils, and 3 big ink on the front page of hsi journal and 7 stickes each to 6 other page of her journal`. I found this instruction to be difficult because I have seen very small pencil and a large pencil, but I had never seen a very small pencil...So I wrote down the answer I had chosen for `B`. Then I wrote down the answers for the questions. I wrote down `<<5+7=>>12` because I knew that `7*3` was the right answer for the large pencils in the equation. I also wrote \"I am not sure\" next to the number of how many I wrote down. then I saw the rationale for the questions. The rationale for the second question stated `The second part of the answer explains that each of the smaller stickers was used the same as a large pencil each`. Since each small pencil was equal to each large pencil, I know I had written down `5+7=12` and not 19. So I deleted my answer and wrote down 12 instead. Then I read the new instructions: `Input: What do you fill with inkl to print? Choices A: squid B. pencil C: newpapar D: fountainpen E: printer`. For the question that askes what will you fill with ink...I chose `C` The answer to question number 14 says `I chose A` for my initial response...but when I read the rationale..it states `We can only use the printer 7 times, so the correct answer is `C``. So...I had a choice to make. If I wanted to stay with my answer...I would only have 12 stickers left...If I wanted a higher score I had to change my answer. I choose `C`.

{"text": "Input:You can only use each of your 4 eggs once. You want to make omelettes with 6 eggs but your house didn't have enough for 6, so you had to borrow 2 eggs from your neighbor. The problem is that now you have too many eggs. How can you avoid putting 6 eggs in the pan and still have enough yolk left for 6 omelettes?\nRationales:\"Using only 4 eggs once\" is the same as \"4 eggs is used once, but after using the eggs, you cannot use that same number of eggs\"\nSince you do not have enough eggs, you will not be able to make 6 omeletts. You will only have enough yolk for \"N eggs in one omelet\". But since \"N eggs in one omellete\" is the same you can only use 4 eggs once. Since you cannot use this number of eggs more than once, there are no more eggs. So you cannot make 6 omelets anymore.\n#### NOTE: Eggs are represented by the number 6, as the question states. The question then represents 4 eggs by 4.\n\n### Output:Input:What is the worst consequence of 4 eggs? Choices:  a: cause death b: cause injury c: cause disease d: cause pain e: claim insurance\nRationales:The question first states \"When 4 eggs are used for 6 omelets, there is always only enough yolk left for \"N eggs in 1 omellete\" eggs...\". Therefore:\nThe problem is that after using your 4 eggs there are no more eggs, which means there is no yolk. Therefore the worse consequence is that there are 4 less eggs which means there are no more eggs to use.

She had either 3 dollars and 56 coins or else 74 coins.\n\nRations: If Mary started with 3 dollars and 65 coins, she had 3*100 coins, so that would equal 3*10$ or $300. If she had 74 coins, she would take two dollars, so that would be 2*100$100 or $200.\nIf she only had 74, she would take 10 dollars.\nIn total, she would take $300-$200+10= <<300-200+1=10>>10 coins.\nShe gave Sam 43 coins, so Mary started with 10 coins left.\n\nAnswer: <<10>>10\n\n### Test 2:\nInput: Mary, a pizza delivery girl, had either 120 pizza slices or she had 10 pizza slices, and 84 dollars.\nRation: If Mary started with either 120 or 140 pizza slices.\nIf she started with 120 slices, she would have 120*$(10/60)$p$ or $120*20/60=20$20 dollar slices.\nIf her starting number is 140, she would have 280, which is 280*2/10=28$28 dollar slices. \nBecause she started with 84 dollars, she would take 34 dollars. The total would have her left with <<20+28+34>>178 dollars, but she had enough so she delivered 82 pizza slices.

However in this case 3/8 is not a proper fraction because it is not the same number as 1/4.  So it does not work and is wrong.\n\n### The answers to these problems are based on knowledge from previous lessons, and should be answered with the lesson in mind.\n\n### **Factoring Questions**\nIn problem 2 below, we found that 48 = 2 * 2 * 2.

For the purposes of this problem, \"Knock the wind out of the soccer ball's net\" would need to include knowing the position and mass of the player. There is no way to know both of these values without actually watching the game. Similarly, the missing information in the \"I'm going <place> with <name> later\" question is \"place\" and \"name\".

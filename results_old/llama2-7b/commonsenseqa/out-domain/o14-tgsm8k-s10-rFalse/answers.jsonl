If the tank holds 6 gallons and the car holds 2 gallons extra, how many miles could the car travel?\nAnswer: 92\n\n### Multiple Choice Question:\nQuestion: A car needs 6 gallonns of gasoline to go to a store that's 25 miles away. The extra fuel tank can hold 2 gallonns. How many miles can the car travel?\nChoice: If the car is 6/25ths full before going to the store how much fuel does the car use to go to the store?\nAnswer: 20 gallons\n\n### Multiple-Choice Question\nThe owner of a store charges customers $0.15 for each pound of cans. If each full can weighs 2 pounds and the price of the cans was $0.08 in 2010, how much did the owner make from 2 cans in 2011 if the price of cans was now $0.18?\n\n### Example solution to problem 8:\nExample: How many pairs of shoes were sold in the shoe store if the number of shoes sold were 20% less than the number of shoes remaining?\nAnswer: If there is 60% of the number of shoes left over and you know the number of shoes was 20% of the number remaining then you can calculate for 100% of the original stock. For this example 20% was sold and there 100-20=80 left over. So to get to 100 we would add 80 back to the original number. 30-20=10. This means there would be 40 more pairs of shoes or 110 pairs of shoes.\n\n### Multiple choice problem 9:\n\n### Example of how the solution works:\n\n### Multiple question 10\n\n### Example Question 11\n#### Example Question 13\n\n### Multiple Question 14\n\n### Multiple Problem 15\n\n### Example Problem 1", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

{"text": "C\n\n### Demystifying the task\n\nThis task is about asking about and answering a question. We can say \"Does someone do a certain activity on a piece of furniture?\" The task is saying \"Does someone keep their leg elevated when their leg is broken?\"\n\nWe understand that one does not keep one's leg elevated on a spinning wheel.  We also know that one does not keep their leg elevated on a hospital bed, as that is what happens when a leg is broken and is elevated to heal.\n\nThere is no good reason to assume that one keeps their leg elevated on hospital furniture, as no one would ever keep their leg elevated where they are injured. There is no good reason to believe one keeps their leg elevate on an office chair.\n\nThe answer is a grand piano, and that is because it is the only piece of furniture on which one would keep their leg elevated while recovering from a break.\n\nWhen someone keeps their leg elevated while it is broken, some would choose to use a grand piano, but one does not have to.  It is not necessary.\n\n### Tips for working through the tasks\n\nWe work through this problem by trying to narrow down the possible answers.  We are only considering choices that someone might keep their broken leg.\n\nAfter we think about all the possibilities, we eliminate the ones that do not give anyone a chance of keeping their broken leg on an object on which they can sit while keeping their leg up.\n\nThe easiest way to think about this is to assume that a person's leg is broken, as it might not be, and then ask \"What is the best place you could keep your leg elevated while you are sitting?\" Then think about what kind of activity you would need to be able to do that where you are sitting.  Then eliminate the choices that do not allow you to sit while broken leg is elevated.\n\nIf you think of the activities someone may be involved in with their leg elevated as well as where they keep their leg elevated, then you can consider a variety of activities that involve being raised high up on furniture, being on furniture that is high off the ground, or other uses that one might need to keep their leg elevated.\n\n### Explanation of the answer choice:\n\nWhen a person's leg breaks, then they are not able to walk", "answer": "C: hospital bed"}

{"text": "The correct answer is C\n\n### Explanation:\nYou can get the \"right\" answer for this by eliminating the wrong choices, which would be D, A, E.  It would be found in a desk.  You can tell that based on the sentence alone, without having to analyze it.  B would imply that it would be found in their place of work, so you don\u2019t want to choose that.  E says it would be kept in school, which doesn\u2019t make any sense because it could also be kept in the place of work.\n\nAs for A and B, they would be in the home, which doesn\u2019t work because the question would be about what it would be kept in.  C is also a choice.  But C would indicate that the place of work and the place where he spends most of his time.

How much will it cost you to buy 2 cans of food, 12 apples, and 2 bottles of oil costing altogether $56?\n\n### Response The correct answer is A. 126 \n\n### Explenation You can eliminate options other than A because of the $7 discount.   B would cost you way out of range, based on the question. \n\n### Input You buy a book and get a 10% off.  This discount is applied after you get an additional 15% off on two books. You spend $39. How many books do you buy?\n\n### Solution Answer: C \n\n### Elaboration You can use rules and logic here.   You know if you are 10% off, and then you save 15% on two books.  Do you save 25% each?  So you know your discounts are 25% each. \n\nSo what you know is $39 would cost 75 cents.  Thus, 2 books would cost $1.50 each.  Substituting the values, $39 in $39 = 1.5 for each book. \n\nTherefore 2 books would cost 30 cents, or $39 - 1.5 =", "answer": "C: desk"}

There are exactly 1 \u00bd pounds of white pineapple for every special pineapple, and each special pineapple eaten costs $2 each.

That is a question that has been around for a long time and has been answered in many ways. The key to eating pineapples, and enjoying a healthy life is to eat lots of fruit! I am sure that you are excited at the prospect of eating a ton of fruit every day, but before you get too excited, let me tell you that these fruit pineapple's are only for certain people. They are only for people who like to eat things like oranges and apples, which do not have the same taste, texture, or color as fruit does.\n\n### Answer:A: The solution above is incorrect.

Input: The current stock price is $179. The 2014 revenue is $15 million. The dividend per share is $1.50.

This ratio works well when dividends are a large portion of the price per share. We know that the current stock price-that being \\$179-is equal to the 2014 dividend multiplied by the number of shares; thus the 2013 dividend/price per-share ratio will be equal to this year's dividend/stock price. This year's dividend was \\$15 million / 179 = \\$560.39 per share. To find the number of shares required to reach dividend of \\$15 million, we simply divide $560.3 9 by \\$179-thus, the number of shares is 31.22.", "answer": "B: office"}

If he buys only nuts, his cost will be the same, $12 x 3 = $36.

A man's old boat can hold a tank of fuel that costs $200. After 50% increase in price and 20% extra capacity he needs to fill his fuel tank. How many hours it took for refueling the tank?\n### Solution:\nThe total amount he spent on fuel = $480\n\nGiven that he gets his extra tank capacity, he spent $200 on each tank filled.\n\nThen, he will fill 1 tank of additional capacity of $480.\n\nThere are 480/200 = 2.4 tanks.\nSo, this is the total number of tanks.\n\nHence, it took 2.4 hours (60/2.4=2.4) to fill the tank of fuel.\n\nIt may look like this is incorrect.\n\nAssume he pays half the tank capacity.\n\nThen he paid 200*(1+50)/2 = 288\nAlso assume that each additional tank capacity is 20 bucks.\n\nThen, to buy 6 additional tanks, he needs to pay 288*(6/2) = $288*(3) dollars.", "answer": "E: harmful"}

{"text": "E\n\n### Democracy\n\nA democracy is a political system in which all eligible citizens vote to elect their representatives who then vote on the country\u2019s laws or decide policy issues. Democratic citizens live in a community where all eligible citizens have equal voting rights in a process that is usually direct.\n\n### Monarchy\n\nA monarchy is a form of government where sovereign authority is formally held by an individual called a monarch, who acts on behalf of a state and his or her people. Unlike the ancient absolutism where the monarch holds supreme power over the state and their people, these monarchs, such as those in the contemporary constitutional monarchy of Spain, exercise their power within a framework of law known as constitutional monarchy. In constitutional monarchies, the monarch\u2019s and his or her government are held to account by representational democracy.\n\n### Dictator\n\nA dictatorship is a form of government in which power resides in a single person or a small group of individuals. The government controls everyone\u2019s lives, making decisions for them.\n\n### Totalitarianism\n\nTotalitarianism is a political system where the state recognizes no limits on its authority and strives to regulate every aspect of life, political and economic. Totalitarian governments generally have a single unifying ideology, which controls how the people should think and act in order to be successful citizens.\n\n### Response\n\n> There are people in the world who have the power to make decisions about everything. Some people have this power through election, some get it naturally. A democracy is a government with a democratically elected leader or leaders, where power is divided amongst the people based upon their vote.\n\n### Solution\n\n> The word democratic means governing through people. People vote to elect their representives. The representatives then vote on the country's laws or decide policy isues. A democracy is like a republic, except that in addition to electing representatives, citizens of a free republic participate in direct democracy. They directly solve policy issues and vote for representatives.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n#### More Information:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy\n\nhttps://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/democracy\n\n#### Exempl", "answer": "C: study"}

That means that we would like that percentage of the elements in our product to come up to 100. So 980 atoms is 0.098% of X.\n\nThat means that our product must consist of x in a total 980 atoms. Since X is 75% of the entire product by units of percentage, we can say that X should be 3.0 x to equal 980.\n\nX = 3.0*980 = 3 times 980 - We want X to equal three times 980.

It tells us we don\u2019t always have choice.  However, we do not have always choice and this does not need to define our view of the world.  There are many choices in life and our choice of what we do is always the right one.  For example, let me narrate my day.  I take my daughter to the kindergarten early in the morning where she makes her first friends outside home.  I drop by the library nearby where a few of my friends are having their morning walk.  I pick up a book while chit chatting with my friends.  On my way home, I get a call from the CEO of the company where I work and we have a discussion over a few ideas related to my department.  My wife and daughter come back home while my son calls home to ask about my mother\u2019s wellbeing.  She tells my son that his grand-mother has a cold and is feeling unwell.  I go to the local grocery store to buy grocery for dinner.\n\nThus, my day was an eclectic mix of various activities ranging from social activity at the library to physical exercise at the park or with my daughter at the play school.  My daughter was playing with other children at the playschool while I was walking with my friends or discussing work related issues with my boss.  My son was talking to his mother or grandmother, and my wife and I were getting the daily required groceries for dinner.  I was doing all these because I was getting what I wanted and needed to make my day happy.  I was getting a feeling of fulfillment of doing a decent job for my family to make their life and mine happy.  I did not regret my choice of going to work and getting a paycheck to feed my family.  Neither my mother regretted going to the grocery store to get her grocery for her cold.

{"text": "I can find a map or information about bus lines at the bus station.\n\n### Input\nGive me some information on how much data is used by common activities.\n\n### Response\nYou probably use several GB of data every day on your smartphone. That\u2019s not all! Your phone also uses data to update the settings and the apps. Most of the apps don\u2019t need to connect to the internet to work. There are exceptions: when you\u2019re not connected, Facebook or WhatsApp may update data locally.\n\nTo find out how you use data, download your usage report for the last month so that you can see your data usage history. Data for the last 12 months are available in the last 3 months.\nBrowse to Settings>Network & internet>Mobile>Mobile data usage. In the graph you should see how much data is used on your smartphone. You may also check your 3G and 4G usage in the same menu. When you have checked the usage, go to Settings >Apps >App name>Battery to see how much memory data uses. This information will help you determine which apps are taking up too much memory on your smartphone.\n\n### Answer: \nWrite a program that accepts integer values from the user and calculates the sum as well as the average of this values.\n### Input:\nWhat is the sum of your daily calories?\n\n### Response1:\nMy diet includes about 400 calories per day. However, 240 of these occur on my lunch or on a snack. I only eat this on a few days a week. If I had a normal diet, I would eat about 240 calories.\n\nMy average calorie consumption is 305. The average of all numbers is always (total sum / total size of the numbers). This would be 305 calories. So you can calculate the average daily intake of calories by adding the total sum and dividing it by half. This sum would be 320.5 calories and my calorie intake rate is 3.5 grams more than the average. My average daily calorie intake is about 350 calories. The main difference is that my weight was higher before I started exercising.\n\n### Output1:\nThe average", "answer": "C: maps"}

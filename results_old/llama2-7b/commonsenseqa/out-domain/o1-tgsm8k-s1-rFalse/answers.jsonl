{"text": "Choice E\n\n### Instructions\n\nThis is what I think: what you are looking for us to do is tell you how to describe a function that takes input(in this case, strings) and returns a string. I could probably get it done using 8010 but I'm not sure anyone else would. Let's write a function.\n\n### Implementation:\n### How it works:\n> We have two variables, the first the one that takes an input (in this case, a string) and the second is the output of that string (after it has been manipulated by the function).\n\n### Example:\nThe input is \"What would you tell ali the answer is.\" The output is \"What would you give Ali\"\n\n### Code:\n\n\n### Solution\n\n```\ndef tellAli (string){\n\tlet count = string.split(\" \");\n\tlet output = count[0]+' the answer is.';\n\tcount[count.length-1]='the answer is';\n\tcount[6]= \" What would you \"\n\toutput = count.join(' ');\n\treturn output;\n}\n```\n\n### Test\nTest 1:\n> `tellAli ('What would you tell ali about')\n//should give me \"What would you tell Ali about the answer is\"`\n\nTest 2:\n> `tallAli ('What would give ali the answer')`\n// Should return the message given\n\n\n### Assessment\n> Good job, you created a function that takes a string and then changes that string.

{"text": "**The lady did sleep then wake.**\n\nGreetings, Friends! I am so happy to be here! I love to tell stories, and I'd love to tell you all one today. If I could tell you, that is. Do you understand me? I'm starting to become a bit embarrassed, to be honest. I'm starting to realize that the story may not make much sense, as I haven't practiced telling it a lot. I may not even know how to write a story! I've always felt lost, trying to speak in public, and trying to listen to people try to speak. I feel like I don't have much confidence to do much of anything. I guess maybe I don't know what to do. Doing my tell story is such a task. I have never done a task as huge as this. I need to learn how to do a tell story if I want people to think of me as a person of importance. That's one lesson I learned from my first few days here.\n\nAfter thinking it over, I figured that I could try to just... do other things like everyone else. So every night, I'm going to the community chorale here to sing. I'm just not that great at singing. As a matter of fact, my singing could put you to sleep. I used to tell stories about the time I was almost put to sleep. There was once, when I was a little girl, around 5 years old, I was at my grandma's house, and I had a nightmare. It was a really weird dream. I dreamed that there was an angel that was a cat, a talking dog, and a spoon. It's been so long since that night had past. I think the angel probably just wanted to see what I would do with it. I had the spoon, and I used it to fend off the dog before it reached my throat. When I woke up, I was still holding that spoon to my neck. I woke up next to my grandma, and she was giving me a concerned look. My grandma's concerned looks always creep me out, so I got up and went outside. I was outside under her tree, and I saw the most beautiful sunset I have ever seen in my life. It was beautiful.

{"text": "How to use the harpsichord :\nIt is one of the oldest instruments known. It was originally used in 1555 when the composer Giovanni Artusi, better known as Giache wrote the first publication to be used with the harpsichord. To use it, one must make sure the hammers are all in the same place before you play your song, then after the song you must replace them. One must also make sure to be seated in a place where all of the people who are in the room will not hear your song. It was first played in private rooms.

{"text": "Input:Always wash hands before eating, don't want germs into the water system, spread disease into the mouth and doctor into the ear so that D is the correct answer.\n\n### Explanation\n\n> The answer to the first example comes from using the mathematical properties of integers. We add the 3 to the starting number 89 because it is always positive. The number of stickers used to the other pages is the sum of the size of each page in stickers (7 per), which is always negative. The answer is 44, the sum of the starting and used numbers. Here is my code:\n\n~~~JavaScript\nvar a = 89;\n\nvar sumx, summ1, sum2, sum3;\n\nsumm1 = a + 3;\n\nfor (var i = 1; i < a ; i++){\n    summ1 = a + i;\n}\n\nsumm2 = a - i;\nfor (var k = 0; k< i; k++){\n    summ2 = a + k;\n}\n\nfor (var j = 0; j< 3; j){\n    sum2 = a;\n}\n\nvar sum3 = a + 7;\nfor (var m = 0; m < a; m++){\n    sum3 = a + m;\n}\n~~~\n\n>The second example should be answered using common human knowledge.

Neural networks are an implementation of computational models that are inspired by the working of the animal brain. A neural network learns when given proper unlabeled training data and correct labels for the training examples. A common use of neural networks is pattern recognition e.g., in speech recognition applications neural networks classify the sounds into phonemes.\"\n\n\n###  Input:\nWrite a program that prints output that answers the following questions:\nInput: Do you want fries with that?\nAnswer: McDonald's sells french fries\n\n###  Solution:\nInput: Do You Want Fries With That?\nAnswer:  McDonald's seller french fries\n \n---\nNeural Network Basics\n---\n\n## Overview: What is a Neural Network?\n\n- Computational models that are inspired by how the human brain works.  \n\n## Components and Concepts\n\n### Software\n1.

{"text": "CORRECT!\n\n### Democracy is a method of government for voting or the collective determination of things by the majority. The rule \"majoritarianism\" often refers to the decisions made by a majority in contrast to the minority. The term \"majoritarian\" is often used by economists, political scientists, politicians, public intellectuals, and others who favour majority rule. Democracy in its most broad sense includes both liberal republics which have elected governments and the concept of direct democracy where people decide on issues for themselves. In a \"majoritarian\" form of government, democracy is a system which is governed on the basis that the wishes of the majority are always supreme. In modern societies, majoritarianism is sometimes described as a \"will of the people\", with this term emphasising that decisions and actions are the exclusive authority of the majority who, if they chose, might choose to make decisions which would not be democratic or egalitarian. In this sense, \"majoritarian\" government is a type of democracy which is both authoritarian and one-sided.\n\n### Input\n\n- The man was condemned to ______?\n\n- 7 B\n\n### Democratically elected dictatorships:\n\n- 8 9 10\n\n### Answer\n\nCORRECT!\n\"In a \"majoritarianism\", democracy is a system where the wishes of the majority always supreme.\" Democracy is \"a system where people decide things for themselves\" and \"a way of making laws\". (These all seem to support \"democracy\", don't they?) _O_ democracy supports \"majoritarianism\". _O_ democracy is about \"majoritarianism\": that's the point, isn't it? _O_ democracy refers to a \"form\" of government. _X_ democracy is one-sided. _X_ democratic systems can be authoritarian. _O_ democracies tend to be one-sided (\"majoritarian\"). _X_ democracies are not always one-sided, are always democratic, and sometimes authoritarian.

Wet grass and dew from the overnight rain has yet to evaporate and a light layer sits on the path, making it a bit difficult to walk on. The trail is narrow and littered with many rocks and roots that make it a bit difficult to navigate the forest floor, but that is about to change. You notice that the sun is high above you, but if you walked a little further to the South East, you would be in the shadows and it would be more comfortable. At this moment, 44 feet South of you lies a small clearing, but to get to the clearing you must navigate your way through a small path, which is surrounded by dense foliage and rocks.\n\nYour first thought is to go North, but that doesn't work very well because you will just run into even more dense vegetation and rocks. There is no way anyone can climb, crawl under, or walk around these rocks. Even if you were to dig, you will simply end up with an empty hole. There was just so much vegetation and obstacles to deal with. After a short amount of time, you begin to move closer the clearing. One of the things that you noticed is that there was an old apple tree near the clearing, and the fruit that was still on the tree looked ripe. Even the bark from the tree looked like the tree was in excellent condition. That said, as much as you would like to pick an apple and go into the clearing, there was no way you could reach the apples when standing at the tree. After thinking about the situation for a minute, you notice that the roots of the tree are extremely thin, as if they only covered a small distance from the base of the tree to the top. If you were to place something on the side of the tree that held a lot of weight, the force of the weight would pull the tree over and you would have complete access to the apples. Unfortunately, you did not have anything on you that would hold such a large amount of weight. You were about to leave the clearing, when you finally noticed something odd about one of the apples.

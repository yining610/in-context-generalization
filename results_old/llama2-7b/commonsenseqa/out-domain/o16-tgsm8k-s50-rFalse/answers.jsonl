As a result, the fox needed to move out to find a more favorable place to live. The fox decided to move out of the city and go to live in the dense forest.\n\n## Output:\nThe fox had been looking for a natural habitat. It happened to visit the city and happened upon a family of pigs. The fox was very friendly and decided to move in with them. However, the pigs got too noisy and the fox had to move again. This led the fox to the next place where it finally decided to settle and is living happily in the dense forest now.\n\n\n### Inputs:\n\n### Example 1:The fox walked into the city, but the place didn't live up to its expectations after a week of walking through the city. One day the fox happened upon a family of domestic pigs and felt sympathy for the family of pigs. After all, they didn't have as many ways to hide from humans like wildlife can. The fox decided that it would be better to find a wildland habitat and live a wild and free existence. However, it also felt sorry for the family of pig, so it found a suitable, secluded part of the dense forest, and decided to live with the pigs instead.\n\n### Example2:The fox walked to the city and found that it was the ideal place for its new wildlife adventures. The city was perfect for its needs, as there was always a family of pigs looking to attack it. The fox began to have fun playing with the pigs in the streets every day. After a week the pigs began to complain that the fox was too noisy and too loud. The fox, while thinking it was a good noise, realized that the people in the city began to complain. So it packed up and left for the wildlands, finding that there werren't nearly as many pigs in the wildlands as there were in the cities.\n\n### Response\n### Choice-2 : A\n\n### Choice -1:E\n\n### Choose the best sentence and edit it", "answer": "C: natural habitat"}

There has to be some degree of motion to be considered a ride. One can ride in a van and have motion, but it isn't a carnival ride because the van is doing the movement. When one imagines a carnival ride, one would imagine something moving a lot. The question was answered completely by selecting C.\n\n### Choices: 6: Choices: A: pumping water B: collecting water C: running water D: heated water\n\n### Response Choice B\n\n### Exclusions: The heating of water would make it boiling. This does not involve water movement in any manner.\n\n### Explantions: All of the choices involve water moving into and out of containers. When water is moved, it does make noise. The flow of water is also continuous, or one can say continuous as the water is heated. Pumping involves making that water movement happen by either pushing or pulling. With a heater, the water gets hot and stays hot by the heat radiating off of it. This method is not considered a method of movement in water. One must be able to move water to make it a carnival ride moving water.\n\n\n### Choice 5\n\n### Explantions: If water is collected in one container, it is then placed into another container. This could be considered movement, but there is no movement of water during collection. The same thing happens with heating.", "answer": "A: communicating with others"}

{"text": "If you are a programmer it is very easy to work with binary codes and understand the 1/0 values behind them. But it is not as likely if you are more of a computer science student to be able to use binary codes and know which country's banks use 1s and 0s as their digits. And this is why you should always know how do your digits change and which country uses which currency instead of just memorizing all of them.\n\nIf you are using a desktop computer then your choices for binary codes will be different than what's written in the prompt above. The reason behind that is that in order to make your computer understand what you want to tell it, you have to tell everything in a different language. So, if you want your computer to understand that you want to save a file, you will type save instead of what is written as 11000.  And if you want to close a file, the digit behind the function would be 10110, which is the binary representation of 'close'.\n\nNow the question is, which country has Amsterdam as a capital? Well, the first thing that came into my mind was that it was the Netherlands, and I was right. And I was able to determine this by reading the first letter of the answer, 'A'.

[Explains why an action or situation led to the next.]\n\nThese are more complex to write, since they will require more attention and careful thought.\n\n### [Describes a situation.]\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Jack is playing with a group of 7 friends from his class and the group has to pick a captain for a game of dodge ball. The dodge ball game will be broken down into matches with teams of 4, so it will be better if the captain is playing in the match with 7 players.  At first, if Jack picks himself to be the captain, he will be the only person playing in the match with seven people.  Jack and the other six players will vote, where there will only be 3 choices, with 1 choice being Jack. Jack could also choose to be captain, or Jack could choose someone else out of the six players to be captain.  If the group of 7 chooses Jack, does Jack have a strategy to be sure that he will not be playing in the match?\nAnswer:\n#### Scenario One\nNo, for the scenario where the group picks Jack as captain, Jack doesn't have a strategy, since he must play in 4 man matches, meaning he has no way of being sure he plays when his team is up. This also leaves him vulnerable in the beginning to being targeted for the first 3 matches.\n\n#### Scenario Two\nYes, for the scenario where Jack doesn't pick himself as captain, Jack does have a strategy. Jack could tell his teammates he is not the captain for that match. This means Jack just won't be playing in matches during that game, effectively ensuring his team will be able to win in each match. However, this also means his ability to get back on the field will take him off his teammates' field during their match, limiting their chances of scoring and winning their match.", "answer": "C: anger"}

{"text": "C is the only answer choice that can fit the conditions.\n\n### Explanation: Since the dog is stray, it is assumed that the owner is looking to get rid of their dog. This dog is assumed to be small or a puppy. The dog is stray, so the owner does not know where it is located. They are looking for it. The only place to find a dog that is not owned is an animal shelter, unless someone brought in a stray. Therefore, A is incorrect. The only place where there\u2019s a pet sale is a pet store, so E is not the correct answer. You will not find a pet store in a living room. If one is offered as an answer choice, it can only be a misprint and should therefore be disregarded. This leaves B and C. The owner does not know where they got the dog or where they live either. They might even be in Georgia if the only option is B. However, based on A and B being incorrect, C must be the correct answer.\n\n### Input:\"Bruce is 15% taller than Bob. Bob is 25% shorter than Bruce. Tom is 40% taller than Bruce. Bob is 350 cm tall. Write a statement that tells how tall Bob must be if the ratio of their heights is 1 : 6.\"\n\n### Response:\"Bob is 200 cm tall.\"\n\n### Exlanation:Let b and B stand for Bruce and Bob, respectively, and t and T for the respective heights of the two guys. Also, a, A, t, and T are the dimensions. The equations \"b is 15 taller than Bob\" and \"b is 1.15 greater than Bob\" result in the following:\n  b = t + 0.15 t                                                               \nThen, \"Bob is 25% less than Bruce\" is equivalent to \"Bob divided by 100 tenths equals Bruce divided by 101 tenths.\" The result is \"Bob is 1.25 less than Bruce.\" The following expression can represent this proportion of numbers:                                                                          110 =\n         101    Bob's height equals 25% of Bruce's height  40 =\n         137    And, Bruce's height equals", "answer": "B: animal shelter"}

If their eyes and arms are each injured equally, what was the percentage of chance of their injuries?\n\n### Response 1: I chose Option B, 4.\n\n### Justification: Let's say that the chance of either eye or either arm injury is 1/5.  This gives a probability of 1/5.   Now, to calculate the combined probability of 1/2, the solution must be (1/5)(1/5)= 1/25, or 4%.\n\n### Input2: Sally, the person most hurt by the accident, had a 1/10 chance of losing her arm. What did Sally have at her disposal to lose:\n\n### Response2: I picked Option B, the eye\n\n### Justifications: Remember that the probabilities for the two people were exactly as stated - but the person who was the most wounded had 1 chance in 10 of losing an arm.  The probability of being the most wounded person, then, is simply 1/9.\n\n### The person with the least chance of being hurt at all is Sue, and a chance of 1/10 is better than a chance of 1 in 5 of loss of sight in Sally's case.\n\n### Now, the two cases combine to 1/9 times 1/10.

{"text": "Detailed Explanation\n\nIf they love going to the place, it makes them want to stay there.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n### Demystifying the answer: The first thing to notice is the question's formatting. The question reads: \"...after reading his books, he **went to the store and bought** $15 worth of **candy and had $3 left**. How many books did...?\", which could be reformulated in math notation such as: \ud83d\udcd8 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd = \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc60\nThen, use a multiplication property such as \"when something times itself equals that thing.\" (For example, 2 \u00d7 2 = 2, or 2\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 2). This property is represented by the product, a.k.a the paren \ud83d\udee4\ufe0f. In this way, we have: \ud83d\udcda \u00d7 \ud83d\udcda = \ud83d\udcda, thus \ud83d\udcda\u00b2 = \ud83d\udce6 \ud83d\udee4. Then we can take that \ud83d\udd52 of\ud835\udc5a\u20e3\u20e32\ud835\udc5a and move it to the \ud835\udc4a\u20e3 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud83d\udcda for 8 \ud83d\udcda. \nWhen we substitute 8 for \ud835\udc45\u20e3 and see what the answer is, the 8 looks like a dumb variable, which then we can convert to \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud843\udefe\ud835\udc61. The next step to get our answer is to divide \ud835\udc52\ud839\udde7\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud832\udd00\u20e3\ud835\udc5b\u20e3\ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c by \ud835\udc5a\u26ac\ud835\udc5a\ud83d\udd57\ud835\udc5a\ud8ac\udcfc, which we can rewrite as \ud835\udc5a\ud899\udc1e \ud835\udc5a \u00d7 \ufffd", "answer": "D: staying there"}

This command is a conditional command to check the value of a variable based on the rules you provide.\n\n**2) The if Command syntax**: <variable name> is \"if\" <expression>.  The variable name is the expression you want to check based on the values you provide in the \"rules\" of the command.  It is typically the same name as the variable that stores the expression.\nYou can also insert any number of \"then\" expressions between the variable name and the \"else\" expression after the last rule.\n*if* the \"expression\" is true, then execute the first of those expressions.\n*if* it is false (not true), then execute the second of those expressions.\n\n**3) The rules of the command**: Each time you provide an \"if\" condition, you must also provide \"rules\" to dictate the actions that you wish to take.  The rules are simply how you want to take actions based on the results of the conditions.\n\n**4) Examples of if Command Rules**:\n\n*a* is greater than 3: do \"rule\" 1.\n*b* is less than 3: do the \"other rule\" 2.\n\n*a* + \"b\"\n\n*if* the expression is true (a + b), do the first rule.\n\n*if* it isn't true then the \"other\" rule is true.\n   *then the \"other\" rule action should be executed.\n\n*if the expression is true, do \"rule\" 3.\n*if* all 3 are true, do \"rule 4\".\n\n*if the second \"rule\" 2 is true, do \"other\" rule 6.\n\n---\n### How", "answer": "B: theater"}

In the musicals that I have attended, all the instruments were featured, from the percussion to the strings. The instruments were in their own section, not mixed together like in an orchestra. I would recommend listening to a marching band or a military band when you hear the instruments together with drums and brass because there is a huge difference.

If the box is 75% full of air, how much does it weigh?\n\n### Response(s):\n645,000kg=1423lb\n\n### Explantion:\nIf you weigh your stuff and have a box it weighs 113lbs, the box is then 75% full. If you have a 1.2 cubic foot box, it weighs 66lbs or 116lbs full. Full 66lbs less 116lby3=97lbs of air. You would divide 66lbs by 1.33 to get 50lbs. 50lbs of air plus 50lbs=100lbs or 55.5lbs of paint. So 100lbs times $4500=$45000 that's the paint, then take away $443500 leaving 6500. So if the box is 7.5% full then it weighs 7.5 of 100 leaves 6500, which is less than 280.5 so you don't want any more air in there.\n\n### Expertise", "answer": "A: coffee"}

The camel train must carry at least 58 bags of wheat to the village, otherwise there won't be enough wheat to reach the markets and villages during the week.\"\n### Input:While driving 170 miles through the state of Maryland with my 7-year-old daughter and her grandparents in the car I stopped to get gas in a town called Hagerstown.  I didn't realize it at the time, but I forgot to switch the car seats and ended up getting caught speeding when an officer in Frostburg measured and ticketed my car at 92 miles per hour.  If my daughter had been two years older and hadn't been on the trip at all, how much would I have owed the officer in fines and additional gas costs in order to arrive back home without being caught speeding?\n\n### Note: Your answer should include the following three statements:\n\n1.  After subtracting my daughter's age and the extra gas cost, I still owed the officer $520 in fines.\n\n2. Had my daughter been any older, I still would have been speeding the whole way.\n\n3. If my daughter had been sitting at the correct age seat, we never would have left the state of Maryland.\n\n### Response,\"I understand that you got a ticket while traveling through Frostburg, Maryland while on your way to my home in New York. First of all, I understand that your daughter is 7 years old,", "answer": "C: own family"}

If there are 428 employees in the mall, where do most of the people work?\n\n### Response:#1\n\nThe most likely answer is A. This is an expository writing task and the answer is a simple math problem. We could easily assume that the largest department in the mall is the movie theater, but if that were the case these questions wouldn\u2019t be necessary. If the majority of the employees work in the movie theater, there\u2019s going to be a lot of empty space with no employees working there. This would mean that the person needs to rethink how the employees are spread out in all parts of the mall.

Helicopters are able to fly and maneuver while carrying payloads.  They need the support of the ground though and they don't have the capability of carrying massive amounts of cargo like airships. Another way is to use weaponry to shoot down the enemy's airships and helicopter.  With a cannon you can only shoot down the enemy' but helicopter can fly underground and bomb the airship with a bomb.\n\n### Exercise:\n#### Question:Both children of two friends are the same.

If Sarah is sixteen years old, what is their combined age nine years from now?\n\n### Solution\n\nI was given two variables and the information that 8 years after the younger is the result. In this equation, I found that the question is based on the number of years for Sarah and Kyle to reach a total of 9 years. Therefore, I plugged in the numbers: 8 years and 6 years. Sarah's current age is 16. Based on the fact that she is 6 years younger than Kyle and that he is 7 years older than Sarah; therefore we can assume that they met in middle school. They will reach their combined age after 9 years, so I subtracted the differences and then added 7 to the new result. Sarah will be 23 and Kyle will be 28 at the end of the 9 years.\n\n### Essay\nSince Sarah is 16 years old, we are looking for what the combined ages of Kyle and Sarah will be after 9 years of her being born. We are told that Kyle is 5 years older than Sarah and she is 8 years younger than him. Therefore, we can calculate how many years it has been since Sarah was born. Sarah is now 16, so we can start with her 8 years into the future. To find out what the combined ages of both Kyle and Sarah are after 9 years we must subtract all of their age differences. If Sarah will be 24 after 8 years, and Kyle will be Kyle's current age, 28 years old, Sarah is 23 in her calculation. Therefore, we subtract 6 years to get their combined age of 27 after 9 years have been added to the difference.\n\n### Other Tasks\n### Demonstraci\u00f3n:\nAnswer: 1 cent.\n\n### Soluciones:\nInput: A:B\n\n## Instructions\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n### Response To:\nInput: If she spent $75 on a dinner out.

(Note that the other choices mentioned can also be the result of reflection, such as when the wood is burned or when it is polished.)\n\nThe answer is A.

{"text": "D\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe book has a length of 120 pages, so each page is 0.5 of a page long. Each additional 40 pages would multiply the total length by 0.5. The multiplication is performed, reducing the total age of the individuals if each age is 150.\n\nFor the answer: 128, consider there are 1200/12 = 100 pages per year; each age can be increased by the amount of pages (1) divided by the remaining pages (time). The individual 40 is multiplied, the one whose remaining time increases by 40. \n\nIn this example, Hurleys mother must buy books with $1100 = 10*110 which means each book must cost $11, multiplying Hurley\u2019s age.\n\nTo receive $15 in candy, 13 books are planned for a total cost of $170.\n\nEach person will have to pay $40 for 128 books + 1200 = $588. This is true since the individuals have split the cost equally. The split cost is $3/book which means there are 20/3 = 2.33 additional books.\n\nIn this example the friends will have to spend $170 (they must pay 40 for the increase in 1). 2.33 times the cost of the books = 590\n\nThe remaining cash is the 5/6 of the total cash, or $1000. 1000 = $240, which means 4 out of 5 people have one cent for each page.  6 times 4 is 24.\n\n24001 = 8, 4 out of 6, is 6 pages each, for 100, and 8 is the total 8/9. 91/9 = 1440.\n\nLauryn\u2019s children contributed 6/9 of the funds; Aurelia\u2019s children made twice the contribution. Therefore, the total amount is equivalent to 54/9 of the original.\n\nJohn ate 4", "answer": "B: health department"}

If the interest rates are the same from other people who lend the same money, he would only pay $450 a year. If he uses his own money he would pay interest of $2,501 if the loan is only for one year. That interest would be at 10% interest per year. If it was two years he would pay that interest plus another $550 (rounded - a straight 10% interest every year would be $550 and he would take out a $2000 loan for $3,550).

He finishes the 200-pages easily enough by making one page equal 25 hours. How many hours does it take to finish the book?\n\nI have never seen such a thing! The solution is 16 hours. In this problem, 200 hours is divided up into each page. Each page is 25 hours. The solution is 125 pages, or 16 hours.\n\n\n### Input Gus is reading a 300-page book. He wants to finish reading by the end of the next month. Can he meet this deadline if he only gets half as much sleep as he usually does?\n\n### Answer:\nNo (300/50)(50)(50/2)=52.5 years\n\n### Input 350-page book. Can meet deadline.\n\n> Gus starts by reading one page an hour. When he realizes he will not meet the deadline, he begins reading 75 pages an hour. By the time he is half way through, he is asleep and misses his deadline. To answer the question, assume that sleeping is as important as reading, so Gus is going to sleep the same amount each day. Sleep requires that he take a 6-hour nap each day. Thus, he needs to read 525 pages, or an hour a day, or 25 hours a week. This would not give him enough time to read 350 pages.\n\n\n## Input: Write a response that appropriatly completes the following scenarios. \n\n**Q1:** Kami is given a task at work to write a script that is going to take her 8 hours.

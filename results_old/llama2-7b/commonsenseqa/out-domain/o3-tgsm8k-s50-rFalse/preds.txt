Choices:  A: wasteland B: ocean C: desert D: parking lot E: flowers<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Justification:The city's park was razed for a yet another wasteland.<n><n>### Input<n><n>Input: The carpool had two cars of three people. The two cars each had the same number of miles on them. The passengers in the carpool were to split the mileage among them and then they could decide who would drive what car. If each car had 536 miles on them, the combined mileage was 3736. How many miles was there on each car?<n><n>### Answer: Choices: A: 362 B: 678 C: 1008 D: 1598 E: 1929<n><n>### Justifications:<n>Because there were two cars and same miles from each car, their combined mileage was 2x plus 1 equals 2x+1 which equals 3736 because 536 plus 536 was the combined miles. There are two cars each containing 6 carpooling persons. Therefore, each car contains 3 passengers and each car contained the same number of miles. We cannot subtract these combined milage because that would be a mathematical model, and not a question of "Input:". Therefore, there is no way to take the number 3 and subtract these combined milage from it. Because we do not need that information, we will need the original number 536 from each car, therefore that is the answer to this question.

Choices:  A: earth B: movie C: party D: served cold E: freezer<n><n>### Response:		<n>In my favorite restaurant at my neighborhood. Since when I was a child, I saw my parents eating cake over the ice cream. On my free time watching movies, in every Sunday morning, my grandfather prepared the cake on the table during the meal in the morning. The people who have the same taste likes what I like. I used to see the cake over the ice scream when I watched the videos with my dad and brother. But I don’t like cake that comes from the freezer. My favorite restaurant doesn’t have cake in the freezer and is not free service. I love both of them without a difference of taste. When I make a dessert, I prefer to make my dessert fresh or home-made. I can’t make the desserts but I could cook food if someone ask me to make it because I do not have a very good skill but I am trying to do my best and I like making dessert and food, also cooking. I like everything being prepared fresh but I love both desserts being prepared in the house and my favorite restaurant. Both of them are fresh and tasty.<n><n>---<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Demonstration:Input: How many miles do I have to travel to fly a total of 3600 miles?Answer: 1800Input: The sum of two numbers is 210.

Choices:  A: downtown area B: container C: ocean floor D: the lost city of atlantis E: high school<n><n>### Response:		Please choose answer choice A!<n><n>### Explanation:<n>There is a shop that gives you points for purchases. There are two rules for collecting points. 1. Every $10 you can collect $1 point. 2. Every $1 you purchase at the shop can be used to buy any item for $10. How much does it cost to buy three items?<n><n>### Solution<n><n><n>### Input<n><n>### Output:<n><n>### Instructions:<n>The question is: Who will be the first to collect their points?<n><n>### Demo:<n><n>### Solutions:<n><n><n>In my solution, I just want to clarify 2 facts<n><n>### 1 : if we buy an item, we will not always use the same amount of money, and in my answer I only need to collect the difference<n><n>### Example:<n>  if we buy an item worth $10, we need to use at least $10-1( = $9 to buy this item. If we buy at least $10 we are automatically given one point, so the difference is $9 between $ 9 = 1 point. So I collect 1 point<n><n>### 2: in example we had an item that costs $10 and had to collect $5 to be given 1 point, so I would use that $5 plus 4$ more to get that point (5+4=9=1point)<n><n>### 3: we always have to collect the difference between the items<n><n>### Example : I spend $10 in order to get 1 point,and another item I spend $5 in order to get 2 point. So total = (1+2) points=3 points<n><n>In short I can write it : (5-1)=4, then total=8+4=12<n><n>### Examples and Rules:<n>### First rule:<n>A group of friends bought 3 sandwiches each one worth $3, but one of them did not collect his points for the sandwiches. So the friends gave him a sandwich so his friends could collect his points as he had already lost his point by not collecting. <n>I found it a little different from my own example<n><n>So I tried solving it with the following steps:<n><n>1. if I take

Choices:  A: kitchen cupboard B: maryland C: chicken D: tuna E: pantry<n><n>### Response:		If Richard is 6 and Hurley is 8, I know from your instructions that 40 years from then Richard would be at age 46. Hurley would be at age 50. This implies that if Richard was 40 years old when Hurley was 20 Hurley was 2 years older than Richard which makes their ages in 40 years 14 years apart, and Hurley would be 7 years older than Richard. For my answer I subtracted 40 from Richard’s age of 40, and added 6 (that is 6+8), and 6+8= 14.<n><n>### Input<n>```<n>A group of six friends planned...<n>```<n>According to the instructions the amount raised at the car wash is $500. They did not provide how many people were at the car wash and how much each paid from the six friends we have the information of $500 raised and each friend paid half the car. From this I know that the amount raised is 100$. The problem is how many other people were at the wash that did not contribute to the cost of the car, or the $500 total the friends could have raised.<n>

Choices:  A: automobile accidents B: backache C: eye strain D: getting tired E: car crash<n><n>### Response:		The most likely answer is A because according to some car accident statics in the US, every two people out of 100 people who get injured in a car  accidents and about one person out of 12 people die as a result of  car accident which also causes pain and can result in death.<n><n>### Input : What is a bad thing in a car? Choices:  (A) The car is old (B) The car stops (C) The car is expensive (D) The car has air conditioning  (E) The car is bumpy<n><n>### Response : A is the most appropriate answer because of its negative impacts such as stopping the car to cause an accident and also cause stress on passengers in the car.<n><n>### Response - (2)<n><n>### Answer:<n>The most logical choice is B, because the most logical answer doesn't need any further reasoning. After learning from the information that Hurley is 12 and 78-year-old, that 12+78 = 90 and then 90+50=140, then combining 80+140 = 220.<n><n>### Answer - (2)<n>### If Pablo’s mother agreess to pay him one cent <n>The most logical choice and most reasonable would be A. Because the most logical choice is the choice which satisfies the requirements the most.<n><n>### The most logical choice and most plausible is D. Because the most logical plausible answer is the plausibl choice which is the most fitting the requirements the most. <n>The most logical answer is 2 because:<n><n>The total sum that needs to be divided between six people is seven thousand dollars. This is because after subtracting the car wash price from seventeen hundred, there is seven thousand left. Therefore, there are seventy people as the total cost divided between six people. Which makes the total cost that each person need to pay one thousand dollars and three hundred dollars in leftover costs. Since the question is asking for the amount that Brad not involved in the total cost would be, we need to deduct two hundred dollars which Brad’s part to the original seven thousand.  <n><n>###  How bad this bad thing is if has to do with a car : -The car is old, it has to do with maintenance and

Choices:  A: injury B: beauty C: late D: mistakes E: annoyed<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A: injury<n><n>B: beauty<n><n>C: late<n><n>D: mistakes<n><n>E: annoyed<n><n>Answer: <n><n>##### Explanation: <n>The first case that happens when a grooming takes more than 12 hours is that the groomer will get injured. The client can complain and request for compensation and the next appointment will take place. <n><n><n><n>When a second groomer is hired, an appointment is created with the start times, the appointment duration, and the end time. The appointment duration is when each groomer works on a client. Each groomer is responsible for 6 clients at a time. Each groomer will be assigned 30 appointments while one new appointment is created for each client each hour. Each appointment has many groomers working for it simultaneously, the number is dependent on the duration of the grooming.<n><n>When a grooming takes longer then it was expected, one of the groomers are injured and another groomer will be assigned to the client. When multiple groomers are assigned to a client, the client is not happy and a late fee has to be applied. A late fee is given by the client to the groomer as compensation.<n><n>When a third groomer joins the team, three appointments are created for each client, and the next appointment starts when the last appointment ends. When a grooming takes more time than the expected time, the next appointment is delayed. If more groomers leave, more clients will be delayed. More groomers will be hired and new appointments will be created. Each appointment is scheduled and there is no reason to delay another one. If more groomery joins, there is no reason for client to delay because a grooming takes more hours.<n><n><n><n>##### Test data:<n><n>Input: 	Each groomer requires 6 clients to groom at a time.<n>	Number of groomers: 3 groomers, which means each groomer takes the responsibility to do 30 appointments at the same time.<n><n>Output: 	30 appointments for each groomer.<n><n>Input:  Number of groomers:<n>3<n>	Number of appointments per groomer is:<n><n>Output:	The number of appointments per groom: 10, which means for every groomer there are 10 appointments at the

(Assume all times will be the same, even at the equator.)<n><n>### Solution<n>The speed at the equator is 29,830 kilometers per hour. If we assume a constant velocity and no deceleration or acceleration along the journey, then, if an astronaut runs at an average speed of 21 kilometers every hour running in a circle around the Earth, the astronaut would need to run a distance of 6,35,20,000 meters around the Earth. As we know, the circumference of the Earth is a little more than 40,000 kilometers, thus, the astronaut would run around the Earth 428,804 times in order to complete the required distance. As such, the answer to the question is that it would take 33,300 times longer for the astronaut to gain the effective weight he would gain by going from Earth to the equator than if he ran around the Earth 20 times.<n><n><n><n>

What is the remaining money that the group of 12 spent on beverages?<n><n>### Response : $16<n><n>### Input A bus costs $35, $0.18 for a taxi, and $1.35 for a ride with Uber. All of these forms of transportation are more expensive than taking the bus. A single bus fare is $3.00. What is the cost of a taxi ride and a ride with Uber?<n><n>### Choice A Choices: A: $60 and $65 B: $35 and $70 C: $35 and 60 D: $6 and $60 E: $60 and 60 F: 35 and 35 <n><n>### Response E<n><n>### Input Can people who are 16 years old own a car? Choices: A: Yes B: No<n><n>### Response A<n><n>### Input Does it cost more to have 16 pizzas delivered then 15?<n><n>### Answer C<n>If it costs more to have 15 than 16, that means that it must cost the same for 16 pizzs as it does for 15.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Though he was an adult he still stereotypical slept on a sofa bed in his parent's what Choices:  A: garage B: horseradish C: living room D: guest room E: basement<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is letter A garage.<n>The instructions above clearly mentioned that "the task below describes a task. Write an answer that appropriately completes task." This answer provided the correct response.<n><n>### Solution:<n>Write a function, called ageCombined that takes two parameters, age and age2, and returns the ages combined in any function form you so desire. It works as follows:<n><n>```<n>Input: The difference between Richard and Hurley’s age is 20.<n>Output: Richard is 34 years old and Hurley is 128 years old.<n>```<n><n>I have made a [codepen](https://codepen.io/shakya1234/pen/zxqXRb) to solve the questions given above.<n><n>### Notes:<n><n>#### 1. In order to answer this question I must use the function “age” which I defined earlier, then I’ll simply compare the two and subtract them to get the sum I am looking for. If you have better ideas on how to solve this problem, by all means please write them out in the comments.<n><n>#### 2. I have no idea why the codepen I made didn’t work so I’ll write down how I solved these questions below.<n><n>#### 3. It took me a while to figure out how to solve math problems using a psuedo-variable in Python. If anyone knows a better way of solving these problems please comment so I can learn as well.<n><n>#### 4. This question seems to have a lot of unnecessary steps. Instead of the first line reading “if Hurley is a 14 years old,” it could simply have read “if Hurley is 10 years younger than Richard.” I have no idea how to change this I just have a lot of ideas of how to better organize code.<n><n>#### 5 I’m sure I can figure out how to get points here on Hackerrank, but the process may not be the most efficient, I only know how to do it a certain way.<n><n>### References:

But we are being deceived. It is only a matter of time until we face insurmountable financial challenges. Financial challenges are already here for millions of people of working age and the vast majority of them are not prepared for this eventuality. The majority of our financial challenges arise between the ages of 30 and 60, when our incomes and expenses increase, but we have less of both.

That’s why financial education must be introduced at a young age in order to protect individuals and to improve their quality of life.<n>We all know financial challenges are a big concern for people – especially during the recent COVID-19 outbreak. We are all affected by the pandemic, and we should not forget the fact that we are living in a global financial world. We are now in a global financial world – a world where globalisation has brought business closer to home and where people, both businesses and individuals, are increasingly interconnected, both economically and culturally.

You use two arrays for storing the list of `objects` and the year each `object` was born.\nTo check if the year specified by the user exists in one of the arrays you first need to loop through every item of each array until the year we're looking for has been found. If we only want to check if it exists in one of the years and not the other we can use a `for-if` with an index and use the current index of the `for-if` to check in our arrays. If we want to check both arrays we would use a nested for-if.\nIf it exists, we update the element with the date stored on it with the value from the `birthYear`. If it doesn't exist we'll create a new element by calling the `addObject` method and assign it the `name` and `birthyear`.\n\n### Question:How do we check if the year exists in both Arrays?\n\n### Answer:\n```js\nconst bday = () => {\n  let bday = new Array;\n  let year = new Array;\n  \n  let add = () => {\n    bday.push({\n      name: this.year.name,\n      birthYear: this.year.birthYear\n    });\n    year.push(this.year.birthyear);\n  }\n  \n  // for-if check if year exists on both arrays\n  for (let i = 0; i < bday.length; i++) {\n    for (let j = 0; j < year.length; j++) {\n      if (bday[i].birthYear === year[j]) {\n        console.log('yea');\n        console.log(bday[i].name);\n        add();\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n  } \n};\n```\n### Part B\n```js\nconst year = [];\nfor (let i = 1901; i > 1999; i = i +", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}

The box is excluded because of the rule \"A box has to have four sides to be described.\"\n\n### Input\n* How many feet did the boxer kick in his fight last night?  What was that answer?\n\n### Response\n* The answer should be 5, right?  The foot has 5 toes, each of which is one unit.  Therefore one foot is 5 units.  The foot is 12 inches or 1200th of a meter, so 2.54 meters is 2540 feet, and of course 5/2.46 meters is 2.045 meters.

The United States of America had a long history of secession, and there were numerous minor uprisings during that period. The French Constitution had very restrictive clauses compared with the United States Constitution's much more flexible stipulations.\nThe colonies were not the only targets of the revolutionaries. For example, American soldiers had a much more difficult time defeating the Native Indians. There are many different types of colonies, with different colonies having entirely different systems of government. Not all colonies were created equal, and this is especially true when it comes to foreign colonies. The United Kingdom of Great Britain, also known as the United Kingdom in the North and South, controlled colonies all over the world. It was a huge, powerful empire that included all of North America, as well as much of Central and South America. The colonies in North America were known as the northern colonies.

{"text": "#### Solution:\nSolution: A\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following question.\n\n## Task 4:\n\nWrite a Python program that is capable of playing a trivia game against a human partner.\nEach player should select a question among those in the list. The first choice of the person who answered last should be the first. Once you\u2019ve picked a question, the program should ask for an input answer (this should be the same as what the human player entered). Finally, the program should compare the two answers. If the answer is correct, the player should receive a reward. If not, s/he should be awarded with a penalty. The prize should be randomly chosen from a set of common prizes like apples, bubble gum, lollipops or candies. The prize cannot be negative!\n\n### Task Details\nEach player can see only his/her own turns in the game.  A score counter should be maintained for both players.  This should be done in a separate method.\nOnce the game is started, a first move must be chosen for the program.  You can choose \"First\", \"Last\" or \"Random\". You can use the program to determine to which player one of the above moves should be issued. A method to do this should be put into another method.\n\nThe game must be fair, i.e. the chance of selecting any one question from the question book should be the same for both players in each round.  Therefore, it should make the selection of the questions random, at least partly.  This can be done with a seed.\n\n### Task 5:\nTo be able to evaluate a list of students and their work assignments effectively, we need to know about the average grade, the total grade and the number of assignments.\n\nWrite a method `getAverageGrade(students, work, assignments)` that takes a list of students, their work and the assignments they did, returns the average grade.\nInput: students - a list of students   work - a list of student work    assignments - a list of students' assignment   Output: average_grade - the average grade based on all the assignments\n\n### Task Solution:\nSolution 1: `getAverageGrame(students, workAssignments, assignments)`\n```python\ndef getAverageGrade(", "answer": "E: warehouse"}

The format of each line is the following:\n\"Number of: Noun / Adjective / Verb phrase\".\n\nThe code needs the following rules:\n\n1. Verbs\n\t+ A verb must be either the only word in the line or part of an 'Active' verb phrase.\n\t+ A 'Passive' verb phrase is one with an object directly after the verb.\n\t+ An 'Active' verb phrase does not have an object directly after the word.\n\t+ Active verbs must be preceded by an intransitive verb and cannot be followed by an object. Otherwise they are passive.\n\t\t+ An intransitive verb is one that does not have an object.\n2. Nouns\n\t+ A single noun is used in a sentence (except when a prepositional phrase comes)\n\t+ A plural noun is used when there are more than one noun.\n\t+ A singular noun can be pluralised but should be preceded by \"and\", for example: \"a book and an apple\".\n\t+ Nouns after \"a\" are always in singular. An object must always be a singular noun, otherwise the object would be plural.\n\t+ You can only end a sentence with a noun or an article.\n3. Adjectives\n\t+ Adjectives must be directly after the noun they are describing.\n\t+ There can never be multiple adjectives on the same word.\n\t+ A single adjective can be pluralised and is followed the determining word \"and\". For example: \"old and white\".\n\n\t### Examples\n\t\t\t+ \"Cats catch mice\" is a 'Verb phrase'\n\t\t\t+ \"'Mice are small creatures'\" is an 'Active verb phrase'\n\t\t\"Cats catch mice' is an 'Active verb'\n\t\t\t\"Passive verbs are followed by an object directly after the verbs.

It involves digging and surveying the dirt and soil to discover any artifacts or remains left out by the people of olden days. It is done with the help of archaeologists to collect information about the life of the people who lived long before.\n\n#### Answer B\nAn excavation can never take place in a cemetary\n\nA cemetary is a place where people come to pay their respect to their beloved ones who have passed away. It should not be disturbed at any cost because it could be really sad for the people visiting the place to dig and disturb the place.\n\n#### Answer C\nAn excavation cannot take place in a building\n\nAn excavation is something which should never be possible in a building. There are lots of materials and infrastructure that can be destroyed if excavated. So, only for the purpose of finding old things people do dig and excavate.\n\n#### Answer D\nAn excavation needs not to take place in a city\n\nAn excavated area should be in a very calm place where activities like archaeology could be carried out.

Since he had already spent the extra fees in the previous game he had to pay two different  cost for fuel.  As a result the new cost of his current fuel is the average of the two cost a plane that fills which is $200 plus the average cost of the two new fuel.  The two cost are $400 and $450.  In order to estimate the new cost based on the two price in terms of our previous game.\n\nTo calculate how much he has to pay in terms of the two prices of previous game, we need t calculate the amount that he has to pay that is not the extra fee.

These components are written in the language of an NL Tool\u2014that is, in the language of the tool that we are designing\u2014and must have a corresponding component structure in Haskell. For example, \u201cstreet\u201d and \u201cstreet papers\u201d have the same component structure: \u201cstreet\u201d.\n\nIt is not necessary for a component to match the pattern of the question, or for the sentence to be grammatical; the component is a match for the question if it contains one component that matches the pattern of the question and has one component that has a semantic match (that is, the component\u2019s meaning is not just a word, but a noun phrase, a phrase or one of multiple options).\n\nIn this case, it makes sense to match on multiple components. The question is:\n\n> What divider store paper?\n\nThe answer \u201cstreet\u201d is acceptable because \u201cstreet\u201d is a valid answer when the question is \u201cWhat divider store paper\u201d.\n\nThe answer \u201cA street\u201d is not possible when the question is \u201c*What divider store paper\u201d because \u201cdivider\u201d is not present in the question.\n\n```haskell\nanswer : String -> [String]\nanswer = map answerComponent. getAnswerComponents\n```\n\n`hasMatching` checks only 2 components of the answer\u2014\"divider\" and \"paper\"\u2014in order to test whether the sentence is a valid, complete answer to the question.\n\nThe answer component, in this case \"street\" (since \"street\" is a valid answer to \"What divider store paper?\"), indicates that \"street\" stores papers. \"street\" is a component of \"A street paper\", and since \"street\" is a noun phrase, it is also a component. So the answer to the question is \"A street\" because it has the matching components from 2 separate answer components.\n\n##", "answer": "B: binder"}

The number of goals scored by Barca was 10% of the total goals scored in all matches. how much more goals did opposing teams score in comparison?\n\n### Challenge Solution:\nThe number of goals scored by Barcelona last season was 10% (10%)of the total goals scored in the league last season (100%).\nOpposing teams scored the following number of goals:\n100 - 10 = 90(opposing teams score 10%(10%) of total goals scored in the season excluding Barcelona goals.\n\nBarca games last season account for 20% (100*)4 of the goals scored last season.  We can multiply by 50% to double it, so (20%*(100*4) equals 20%*(200))\n\n(20%(200)) -10 = 80\n\nOpposing teams score 20% of the goals in the league against Barcelona.  As 50% times 40% equals 20%, we can multiply the 20% of opposing scored goals by 50% times (100*4 equaling 400).  (20% (400)) - 20 = 200\n\nSo Opposing teams score 40% of the goals against Barcelona that year.\n\n### Challenge Challenged:\nInput: a number n. For example, let'", "answer": "C: house"}

{"text": "A. C.\n\n### The Solution\nThe response that the user expects for the first question is the answer to that question. \nThe user expects the answer to be one of the choices provided, but you can also make up other choices if you want to provide more difficult questions.  You can read more about this [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_choice).\n\nThe second question demonstrates how you can use conditionals to provide different answers to different prompts. \nThe only way to get the correct answer by entering `A`, `D` or `I` is to enter `B`.\n\nTo answer the third question correctly, use the same approach. \nUse `if` and `else` to check which option the user has entered and provide the correct answer.  It is the inverse of the previous question: you want to give your users the wrong answer if they enter `A` `D` or `E`.\n\nThe fourth question depends on a series of if loops and `goto`s.  The first time the user visits they will never answer `E`, but when they return, the program will ask them to.  If they select `E` for the first time, they get sent to a loop where you ask them a series of questions to get to `A`.\n\nIn this question you can see the `switch` statement and how it can work with `if`.  The function `chooseChoice()` is a little tricky, it checks all the possible options so it only takes a couple of lines. \n\nNote that there are two different types of `goto`: jumps and executions. \nThe `goto` in this question is an execution, meaning you can go back from whichever direction but only to that direction because you cannot go back to the statement that came before that point.", "answer": "B: main"}

The trick here is that we don\u2019t want a boolean return type but a simple int so we need the lambda to not evaluate the return type.\n\n### Reasoner: A class capable of evaluating given a lambda.\n\n### Explanation with example:The answer to this exercise is 237. In the case 281287908 we could define a class Reasoner which has only one method: \n\n```java\npublic class Reasoner {\n    \n    public int evaluate (int x) {\n        return x*4;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nThe idea is to implement a class which knows how to count, it implements the evaluate method which counts.

{"text": "What would a person have to do to get a passing grade on a college exam? Choices: A: competency B: sticker C: intellectual challenge D E\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following question.\n\n## Description: \n\nA person is considered competent in their schoolwork if they are given the choice of answering a question to get a reward.  A reward is a sticker, compliment, passing grade or avoidance of pain.  If a person is competent in their schooling, they would be expected to have a passing grade.\n\n### Input (Test):\n\nA person takes a college exam.  The following percentages represent the probabilities of getting these:\n\nGetting a sticker has a 65% chance of a passing grade.  Getting a compliment has 73% chance of a passing a grade.  Getting a A grade has a 46% chance of a passing the exam.  A passing grade is 95% likely to be a B grade or above.  A person being competent in their school has a 80% chance of getting a sticker, 75% chance of getting a compliment and 60% chance of getting an A grade.  A student that is not competent in their school will have a 60% chance, 70% chance and 75% chance.\n\n### Output:\n\nThe person is not competent in school.\n\n### Explanation\n\nIf a sticker gets a passing grade with 65% certainty, a compliment gets a passing grade with a 73% certainty, and a A grade gets a passing grade with only a 46% certainty, then a person who is competent in school will have a 32% chance of getting a passing grade with the sticker.  A person who is not competent only has a 21% chance of getting a B grade or a higher grade.  It follows that the person is not competent because they have a 21% / 32% chance and a 29% / 28% chance, respectively.\n\n### Analysis: \n\nThe key concept to solving this problem is to figure out why it is better to get a sticker than a compliment for a person who is competency in their school work.", "answer": "B: passing grade"}

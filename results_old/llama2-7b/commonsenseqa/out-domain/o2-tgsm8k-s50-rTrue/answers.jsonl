To determine the greater of two decimals, remember to follow the following steps:\n\n1) Write each number in the order in which you want it\u2014so, for example, the first digit of \"0.2\", which is \"2\", comes first in the order of the numbers.\n\n2) Subtract the second decimal place from the third decimal place. If this is a positive number, then the first number is greater; if this number is negative, then the second number is greater. The second part of this will be \"number one\" and \"number two\".\n\n3) Subtract the third decimal place from the fourth decimal place. Continue doing this until you get to the last decimal place, which is going to be either the first number or the second number, depending on which was greater in the previous step. If the last decimal places of the two numbers are the same, then the numbers are equal. If the last decimal place of one number is one greater than that of the other number, the first number is greater.\n\n4) Write down the sum of the two numbers and move the decimal point two places to the left. If the number after doing so is greater than the number before doing so, then the resulting number is greater than the previous one; if the number after doing so becomes less than the number before doing it, the previous one\u2014the one before the two-step\u2014is the greater of the two.\n\n#### 34\nAnswer: 36\n\n### Input : Which pair of numbers is the greatest? 3.13 3.87 3.51 2.65\n\n### Response\nThe most significant digits in each number are the ones that go in front of the decimal point.

In order to convert a date to a month, you have to take the number of days for that given month. There are 31 days in January. The number of days for April is 30, and the number of days for February is 28. Using the birth date you input in the field, we are converting to a month and then subtracting a factor for year, in order to get the month. Using this method, you subtract the year, then the month, then the day. For example, if you want the year for a birth date, you would take the date and subtract the year; then convert the leftover numbers to a birth month. If you entered a birth date of Novemver 2, 2005, you would take November, subtract May, and the digits left over would be a 13. 912 is three months and three years. The digit 2 in November is two months plus two years. Using this method, the digits we end up with are 8011.\nThe final step is that we will flip the digits. This is because, we have numbers in front. 8,0,1, and 1, so to find our month, we need to flip the second and fourth digit. These flipped digits are 1,8,0, and 1, this shows us the month of 08.

{"text": "Filling in the correct answer is important in a situation that has a direct impact on a person\u2019s quality of life. It\u2019s important to understand the questioner\u2019s request: In order to be successful in school, a person must have many qualities that contribute to successful learning. First, they must have a positive attitude to the entire process of learning. To have a positive attitude they should expect a fair amount of challenges, but also expect to learn new things, and enjoy these experiences. Next, they should have confidence in themselves. When they are feeling underconfident, they can make sure they don\u2019t underestimate themselves, or they can ask for help. Finally, they must be passionate about at least some subject matters. When they don\u2019t have passion for school, they need a way to get out of the rut of feeling apathetic. They need to think about the value of learning in school.\n\n### Explanation:\nI believe that an appropriate response to my requester would be an explanation. An explanation is a description of what you did in the past, as well as your reasons for doing it. It is a chance for the one being asked the question to give the interrogator information about their past actions, but also why they did it the way they did.\n\nA way to answer a question that gives you a list of things that are desirable is to say which things they do have. A list shows that the questioner is already on the right track, but if they have done all of these things, they should be in the right mindset to complete the task they asked for. It is a good way to support the requester without having to say more or less. A response that contains less is not a valid response, because although it may be true, it is giving a lack of support for the request. A response that contains more is an over-response. It contains unnecessary information, and gives the requester many things to think about. This sort of response is good to avoid, but if you have little details you want to share, you can still be concise.\n\n### Improvement:\nA way to improve my response is to include less details for an over-response. Giving the interrogator more than they need is a difficult task, especially with a limited amount of time. If you include too many details without understanding the requester, you will be giving them more information than they", "answer": "B: passing grade"}

Another example would be that if you freeze dried it then it could not grow mold.

The hairbrush must not be bought as medicine for some illness related disease:\n\n#### B: Hospital\nHairbrushes are not bought as a medicine in a hospital. If you are sick and your hairbrush breaks, you buy a new one online or in a drugstore. Hairbrushes are bought in drugstores and as medication in hospitals or in specialized stores. Hairbrush for sick people are bought in specialized stores and the medication is not directly given in a hospital to the patient \u2013 but to the doctor (or nurse) who then gives it to a patient. A normal person do not go to the hospital nor do a specialized stores to buy a hairbrush.\n\nHairbrush in a hospital for normal people: In a hospital a normal person will get a new hairbrush only if your normal hairbrush stops functioning. If you have a hairbrush that can\u2019t function or is broken, you can not buy a new hairbrush in the hospital. You will get a new brush either if it is provided by the hospital as a part of your medicine. This is not usual for normal hairbrushes. You can also bring your own hairbrush to the hospital \u2013 as long it fits within security policy, e.g. that no sharp objects are brought to the hospital. But a hairbrush is not considered a sharp object \u2013 in general. You can also buy your own hairbrush in the specialized online stores; then you are allowed to bring it to the hospital.\nHairbrush for sick patients: A hairbrush not for normal people is bought in the hospital at the ward or at the discharge room \u2013 if you\u2019re going home early.

Because of this, people might decide to take their snake there to be taken care of. \nAnother place where people can take their animals is the outdoor,  but the exotic snakes do not live outdoors, so they are not \"driven\". \nAnother place that people can take their animals too is a Ditch, but the exotic snake would just be sitting there. \nAnother shop, north america, would just be too risky for the owner of the shop.\n\nExotic snakes that are not kept inside of a pet shop and are not driven there.\n\n### Rules:\nThere are some rules that are needed for this task.\n\n1. Answer the question correctly.\n   1. The RFP will not accept an incorrect answer. \n   2. The RFP will reject an incorrect answer.\n2.

{"text": "The correct answer is A.\n\n---\n### Input:Round each number to the nearest hundred\n\n### Response. The correct method, when rounding numbers, is to start from the 10 thousandth place. If this value is greater than or = 5, add 1, if that value is less than 5, subtract 1.\n\n### Below are a few examples of rounding 2022 dollars to the nearest hundred. If the next digit is to be rounded, then the total amount will be rounded up to the nearest hundred.\n\n#### $2,020 to $2,000\n\n#### $20,220 to $20,000\nRationalize: To round money to the nearest hundred, start with the 10 thousand place. If this is greater than or equal to 5, add 5. If this is less than 5 subtract 5 and continue doing this throughout the entire number. \n\n\n#### $21,620 to $21,000:\nRationalization: To round money to 1000, use the 1000 and do this process:\n1000-500 = 500\nIf 500 is greater than 5, then continue adding 5, if 500 is less than 5 then continue to subtract 5.

{"text": "C: easy\n\n#### Explanation:\nBecause of their shape, obtuse triangles have the advantage over right triangles in the area where they meet a circle. However, a convex object still has a surface area that can contain more matter than an obtuse object with the same angular volume. For a convex object, the surface area is greater than the angular volume.\n\n### Input\nWhat time would a train leave if the time the train arrives is 12:00?\n\n### Response\n\n#### 1:30\nBecause of the nature of time, only a single minute can pass. However, it is a different minute for each event, so you cannot know its exact position beforehand.\nIf you set the arrival time to be 12:02, then I would be looking for a 12:04 departure time.\nIt is not possible to choose a single event to occur at a time between 12:03 and 12:01 or 12:05 in this situation.\nSo, 12:08 would be an option because 12:09 is after 12:07, which is later than the beginning of the beginning.\n#### 1:26\nAnswer: 1:26.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nBecause there is a total of two minutes to go, there must be a total of two seconds to go.\n\nBecause you know that the train leaves at 12.04, you should know that the train leaves 12.06 at the start of the trip.\nThat is, the train will depart at 12:06 if it leaves at 12:44.\n\nBecause there are only two minutes remaining, the train can leave at any time from 12 to 10.\n\n### Response to additional prompt\n\n- The clock will make a noise every day.\n- Tomorrow, the clock ticks twice, with two o\u2019clock coming after three o\u2019clock.\n\n#### 1/2 hour before 3:30\n\n- The train will arrive at 12:10 in the morning.\n- The train will leave at 4:30 in the afternoon.\n- Tomorrow is the first day of the month.\n-", "answer": "D: clear"}

If apples cost $8.60 what must the maximum number of apples it can sell for $5?\n\n### Response : The maximum number of apples the supermarket can sell for $5 is 1000.\n\nExplaination: First, determine the amount for apples costed $8.60.\nWhen there are 4 apples for $6.5 and 2 for $5, the amount for apples $8.6 cost is (4 + 2) * $8.60 = <<4+2*8.6=16.8>>16.8 apples.\n\nNext, determine the apples that the supermarket must sell for $5. For the current situation, there must be 16.8 * 1000 = <<16.8*1000=16800>>16800 apples for $5.\n\nBecause 1000 is greater than 16800, the maximum number of applets the supermarket can sell is 1001.\n\n### Response\n>Covering Letter:\nI just discovered about the amazing internships which the company has to offer.

So their ages are 69+25=35 and 35+35 = <<35+35=70>>70.\n\nThe remaining family member is 60+70 = <<60+70=130>>130.\n\nTheir sum of ages is 69+35+130 = <<69+35=130>>35\n\n#### 35\nAnswer: 35\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question. \n\n### Instinct : \nHow many three digit numbers from 100 to 999 are divisible by 8? \n\n### Rationale: \n1) The digits in any number from 100=001 to 999=000 are arranged as follows : \n`999=0999 899=0089 799=0079 699=0069 599=0059 499=0049 399=0039 299=0029 199=0019`\nAny three digit number from 10 to 99 cannot be divisible by 8, because none of their digits is 4. In the range of 100 to999, 8 is present in each sequence `999=0899 889=00889 789=0078 689=00689 589=00589 580=00058`.Therefore answer is 999-889=<<999-", "answer": "A: being for"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Justification:\n> Grief is classified as a stress because it makes people do unusual things. A grieving person can often seem cold and distant to loved ones (A1). The stress of grief can result in a feeling that the whole world has turned against the person (A2). Feelings of depression, guilt, and anxiety often accompany grief (A3). Often, this is considered an extreme form of stress leading to a condition known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (A4). Grief also causes extreme physical reactions such as headaches (A5), stomach problems (A1), insomnia (A2), and heart attacks (C).\n\n>### Answer D is incorrect\n\n> The effects of stress on a person\u2019s body are extensive.

He plans to buy 128 books and save the money for the candy. He checks out books that are 128 pages each. After reading his books he went to the store, bought $128 worth of candy. How many books does Pablo read?\nRationale: If he reads books of 128 pages, then he read 128 books. Now he needs money. He earned $1.5 per by reading, which makes $18. So he needs $128/1.5 books to buy $128 worth books. So he reads 128/1=128 books.\nInput\nInput: Sam reads all of his books after school and returns them to the library before the next day.

C: None of the members are slow runners.\nD: The fastest runner is not among the group. E: The group\u2019s average runner is slower than the average runner.\nOutput:\nRationales: Fastest runner is the top one because it is the definition of fastest. The top one runner should be slower than average one and the bottom one should be faster than average one. When you run with people, everybody run fast and everybody run slow. Only the slowest and the fastest are different from average runner. So, if the speed of the fastest runners is different from average runner, this means the average runner is one of the members of the group. And then we got _D_.\nIf the top fastness is the same as average runner, it means the fastest runner is not in the group. It means that among the slowest is the second fastest runner. Therefore, among the slowest is also the second fastest runner which means none of the members are slow runner. Because only the second fastest runner is among the slowest. If they are not slow runner then they are among fastest runners. And therefore, all are on the same level.\n#### 7\nAnswer: None of the members is slow runners\n\nWhen you want to solve this problem, remember these four main points.\n\n1. If you are _among_ the slowest (not _the_ slowest), you must be fast.\n2. Fastest runner is _the_ slowest runner\n3. Average runner is not _the_ slowest\n4.

I can\u2019t imagine what it must be like for the victim to be attacked by a wild animal. I do have some sympathy for the wild animals being blamed for such attacks because there\u2019s very little they can do to fight back. They are, though, blamed for such attacks, and that\u2019s just sad.\n\nMy parents told me that there is an old adage about wild animals: \u201ca sleeping dog is safe and sound.\u201d I don\u2019t find that to be a particularly appealing saying now or ever. If animals had the ability to sleep for a while, they would. An old joke about \u201csleeping dogs\u201d is that the dogs who sleep most are mammals, and if an animal can\u2019t sleep, it\u2019s safe to assume that it\u2019s not a dog.\n\nWhenever the subject of \u201csleeping dogs\u201d comes up, I\u2019m reminded of an incident some years ago when a family\u2019s dog was killed. The dog died sometime between when the owners went to work and when they came home. The dog was killed not because of a family member or something the dog did while the family was away, but because it stayed home alone after the family had gone to work. There are many good reasons why a dog should be kept indoors and that a dog should never be left alone at home for an excessive amount of time. I think these facts would make excellent topics for a future blog post or perhaps an article in the local paper.\n\n### Question 1\n\nWhich choice is not a part of the passage?\n\n#### 0\nA.

They can change and use different values, and they can change whenever I want them to.\n\nA computer program can use variables to keep track of different values that may be needed for the program later on. A computer program can set specific values for variables to help it to run better.\n\nExample: The values in a program may be difficult to keep track of, or they may be repeated over and over again. This is why we create variables to store unique, different variables. We use values in variables so we don't write down the same value over and over for everything. This way, we use fewer lines of code when programming.\n\nComputers don't know where in memory data goes unless you provide it with a value that specifically indicates where the data should be stored. For example, the \"value\" of a variable in a program is called its \"address\", and can be thought of as the address of that value and the specific address and location of stored data in memory.\n\nExample: When I use a program, I don't know where the data goes, unless I am told what the specific address is. The data is stored somewhere in the memory or in a file on the computer. For example, when I save a picture using my camera, it creates a file on my computer, which is stored in the memory of my computer.\n\nThe most important", "answer": "C: race track"}

There are 365 days in one entire year. Birthdays occur on the day in which a person was born, not a person's number of days born. For example, if you are born in January, you would be one year old each birthday.  If you are born in July, you would be 3 or 6 years old each birthday, but the same amount of days have passed. This is because you were more than one year old the day you were born.  If you are an adolescent, it is a birthday if you are the age to drink alcohol now, but the same amount months have passed since you were born as the birthdays you celebrated a year ago. For example, if it took you 18 years to go from a child into an adolescent where drinking is permitted to a child, you would not be a year older for the first year, but you would the next. This is because it took more than a year for you to go from a child to an adolescent.

The first night that they go to work, George meets Bob and stays. On this night, George also meets Mary and never travels to her home. The next night Mary meets George on her way to work. On nights that Mary and Geroge do not travel, there is a 50% chance that they meet. What is the chance that Mary meets Bob?\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following question.\n  - Input: Bob stays at home. There is a 40% chance that his travel partner will meet him on any night.\n  - Input 1: Mary and George travel together.\n  - Inputs 2: Since Mary and George travel together, there is a 25% chance they meet, and a 75% chance that they don't.\n  - Afterwards, there is a 0.1 probability that George will stay at home the next night.\n  - Next day, Mary and George travel together again with a 0.17 probability that George stays at home\n  - After the next three traveling nights (where George never stays home), George will travel home on night 4.\n  - Bob will travel with his travel partner on the nights when George isn\u2019t at home.\n\n### Rationales:\n  - Bob stays at home. The probability George met Bob is 40%. Because there is a chance that George will meet Bob, the probability that George will meet Bob again is less than 40%.\n  - Mary and George travel together on any night they do not travel on.\n  - The probability Mary and George didn't", "answer": "A: back pocket"}

{"text": "(Answer A) : Get happy with erections\n\n### Instructions:\n\nYour employer has received a complaint from a former employee about your hiring practices. Your employer wants you to write a response for the employee. Your response can include an explanation of your hiring process and an apology.\n\n#### Hiring Process\n\nIf an employer wants to ensure the best possible employees, many of them are going to look for people who attended school, did better than average on tests (like the GED), and have a great resume. Another thing an employer might want to see is a history of work related accomplishments from an applicant, for example if someone volunteered one time at a soup kitchen, wrote a book, or raised money for a fundraiser, they will all be put on the applicants resume for example:\n* BA degree from a very good university\n* GED \n* Membership in 4 different charities\n* Work related achievements\n\nIf the employer found someone with great accomplishments who was not yet employed, they would give them a chance and give them a great offer which they most likely would accept.\n\n#### Other things an employer can look for:\nThe employer can choose to look for a person who might need work, or someone who is not yet employed so they can help them become successful and loyal. The employer can also choose to look for someone who works well with their coworkers, has a history of showing up on time and doing work successfully, or to not have a record of things like theft and bad driving.\n\n#### Your response: This is how you respond. Give your explanation of your hiring practices. Then apologize to the former employee. Give a reason why you should be given another chance. Explain the situation that you were not hired. Tell the reader why you feel this is important information.\n\n#### My Response\nI hire people who have not only attended school but have also done well on tests. For example if someone was recently accepted to Harvard, and also received a 4.0 on their GED, I would be more inclined to hire them due to their high success rate. The candidate also has to have experience, I want to see that they have put in at least 2 years of work experience.\n\nAs a second part to the reasoning, my company has a strict policy against anyone", "answer": "B: entertainment"}

Countryside, by definition, would not contain a large village. So, that leaves us with ABCD. Now, I'll go about eliminating those options one by one. A: urban areas typically don't contain villages. Suburbs are an area found in many metropolises.\n\nC: I'm going to have to eliminate C, because I know for sure that there are many villages located throughout the countryside, which would render it a choice.\n\nB: I know Ohio has a lot in its cities, but big cities have so much activity that it's possible villages might be overlooked in the chaos.\n\nD: Ohio is more like a countryside than a village.

This leaves us with A and E because they're the only two that remain. However, I'm going to choose C as the correct answer because I'm going to explain why it's better than the other possible choices. Suburban areas are defined as regions surrounding a city.

In other words, we have to read and re-read the passage to gather all relevant information. In some cases, that means reading and re-reading again before writing any response. That is completely normal because we also have to determine what we do not know. In the case of a question like \u201cWhat is the fastest way to get from New York to California?\u201d, the key piece of information is \u201cfast\u201d. We would not want to make a decision about this question without determining that \u201cspeed\u201d was required.\n\nWriting\nOnce we know all the information we need we can \u201cwrite\u201d our response.

Choices A: 12 Noon B: 8 pm C: 5 pm D: 10 pm E: 12 pm\n\n### Rational :\nWhen a truck leaves the first city, the distance from the first city to the second city is 248 - 0 = <<248-0=248>>248 miles.\nWhen the truck reaches the second city, the distance it traveled from the truck's starting point to the truck's arrival is 248.\nIf a truck drives at a constant speed of 50 MPH, in one hour, the truck traveled 50 * 60 = <<50 *60 = 300>>300 miles.\nThe total of the trucks' driven distance is 248 + 248 = <<248+248=500>>500 miles.\nTo complete the task, divide 500 by 300 miles and answer 500/300 which is 10/6 = <<10/6=", "answer": "C: engine"}

Tennis elbow may occur without overuse.\n\n#### B) Professional Player:\nProfessional tennis players generally play an average of 5 to 10 hours a day. The 10 hours represents 5 hours of training to improve play, 3 hours of drilling, and 2 hours of matches.\n\n#### C) Exercise:\nTennis has been shown to reduce the risk of cardio vascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer and can reduce the effects of stress.\n\n#### D) Victory:\nWhatever your level, tennis can be the perfect workout for you. Tennis is probably the single most effective aerobic sport. A typical hour long game involves 1,400 kcal. You can burn up to 500 calories per hour, just from playing alone. You'll keep your heart rate up longer, which means more calories burned than with other sports.

In American English, it can also refer in informal usage to an electric kettle. In British English, a kitty refers to an electric kettler, but, more commonly, it can refer simply to a tea kettle.\n\n### A kettle is a tea kettle that contains a handle (or spout) and a rim to contain the water. It is used to make hot or boiling water. Tea kettles are made to sit on a stove over an open coal fire or over a gas flame.\n\nFor the most part, a kitchen hob kettle is used to make tea, a pot kettle is used for boiling water and a saucepan kettle is used as a saucepan (that kettle in which food is cooked) for sauce.\n\n### The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition\nCopyright \u00a9 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company.

{"text": "Checking an electrical connection requires looking at the switch board, and since \u201cwall\u201d is not an option for a switch board this is true. False is selected as the answer.\n\n### Input :  I need a computer program that can tell the difference between 2 pictures of a scene from the perspective of a specific object in the pictures. I need to be able to take a picture from the first perspective and compare it to a 2nd picture from the third perspective. It would be an advantage that the program can show the objects that are on the screen after analysis and provide the coordinates and the area it was in for the 2 objects I would like to analyze. What does the code look like for this?\n\n### Response :  If you take a picture from the perspective of a point on the scene, the perspective of that point is the line that passes through all the points that are at the same distance from that point.  To make a program that would tell the difference between  different perspectives, you can use the Euler line to calculate the perspective line.\n\n### Explanation: You can find the Euler line using Euler line calculation using trigonometry.  The line has a negative slope, so to solve the for the length of the line, you can find the equation for a line that is a constant distance away from another line: y - 2 = m\u00b7(x+1). Since we know x+1 is our baseline for all of our points - for example, if there is a point at x=1 and a point at x=2, then the Euler line would be the horizontal line through x=1. The Euler line with points having negative X values are called the Euler Spiral.

If these two eggs are healthy enough to develop into a full blastocyst, then procreation could be considered a success.

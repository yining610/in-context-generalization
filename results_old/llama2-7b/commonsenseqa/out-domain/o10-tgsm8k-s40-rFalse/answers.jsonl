The first question states that I can lift 90lbs, and I am looking to lift 1/5 of a stone, well since I divided by 5, I want 5/5, since 5 is the bottom 5/6 so 6/6 is 1, and then add 1 to 1/6. This makes 6 plus 1 to get 7 stones. However we do not need to lift to many cause that stone is not as light. It is heavy, so I will multiply it. We need to know how much I can lift which is 90lbs so we multiply it again. The stone can be up to 1850lbs which is too heavy and we do not get all 0.05, we get 0.03 so we need to divide them again and get 0.9395 stones.\nTherefore we get 19.9115 stones", "answer": "A: street"}

In my honest opinion I believe that there are four different different ways that you can round 62 to nearest hundred. I believe that is because we know that 62 is larger than exactly 62,62, and when we round number that are greater than a certain number it is rounded to the next higher number. That is why in this equation I think we can round 63 to the next higher number because six zero three is bigger than fifty and thirty, and I don\u2019t know if five or seven because they are the same. I also know that if their is a number that is an exact number then it is rounded to the closest number.  \n\n### Input\n12\n\n12\n\n### Response\nIn my opinion I think that 12 is greater because 12 is greater than and below exactly 12 and if their are same then it is round to the nearest number.\n\n### Question\nGiven the below code, what will the first for loop return? \n\n\\\t    var x = 0;\n\\\t    for(var i=0; i<x; i++){\n\t      console.log(i);\n\\\t    }\n\n### Response \n\nIn my honest opinion I think that x is one because in your first line of code you say var x=0", "answer": "B: intelligent"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Reason:\nThe air that has only been breathed by a few people recently should be in a house and probably a train station. It is important to understand that this task is asking for \"only recently\". The train station and house should be close to the top of the list regarding recent air, because neither people nor houses can produce air for long periods of time. In order for air to last, we'd have to breed people or make things that create air. Air is a gas used in exchanging gases. The surface of the earth is very large and, thus, does not have any connection to humans. It was not made to support humans. If we go to a small restaurant, we'd find that it was made for humans and would most likely have the freshest air and food, in comparison to a large stadium where the air has been exposed to thousands of humans within a short amount of time. Air that has been exposed to thousands, but still recently, of humans will be worse than that located at a house or train station. Cupboards, cricket stadiums, and the surface of the earth do not generate air and would have no human connection.\n\n### Other responses:\nThe question doesn't really give a specific time frame as to how recent the air has been breathed. If it were to be more than recently, perhaps a cupboard would be ideal. This is because cupboards tend to be dusty and the air could therefore have'recently' been breathed if the people who were in the house were also in the cupboard.\n\nThe choice of surface of the earth is misleading in that it is assumed that air is found only on the surface. Indeed, as we know, air is also found in soil and air is even found under water below at least ten meters.\n\nIn my opinion the train station is the choice that best describes the condition of air. This is because air in a train station is reused by train drivers. Air must be continually changed in trains, particularly as they pass from hot to cold and vice-versa.\n\nThe choice is'surface of earth'. This is a very bad choice as'surface of earth' does not state anytime since its' creation. This choice has no relation (as far as we know) to people breathing.", "answer": "B: house"}

Make sure the response is in your own words with proper citation formatting.\n\nTo answer the first task, I would use some simple arithmetic. As the puppy population is 20, that means that the number of Schnarzes present is 9.\n\nTo answer question 2, I would first subtract the number of toothbrushes before giving an answer. In this case, that would be 5+5+3=13 toothbrush given away. Because we subtracted, that would mean it left us with 20-13 which is then 7 teethbrushes still left from the initial giveaway.\n\nTo answer 3, I would substract by 50% instead of using multiplication. This would result in the quantity 30 being the total quantity of seashells Sally picked on Monday. The difference is then 15 for Tuesday. To answer 4, I would say multiply by 50% again and use the quantity 15 as the previous quantity to subtract from. This leaves me with 10 fish left which was the correct answer.\n\nTo answer task 5, I would find half of the quantity instead of doubling or using multiplication. This resulted in the quantity 200 on the first line of the formula. To answer 6, I would find one-eighth of the quantity and do the same on task 7. To answer 5, I would subtract from the quantity 72 with the quantity 246 in my solution.

{"text": "Casserole\nAns:B\n\n### Input\nA man needs a gallon of milk.  The milkman is on vacation.  The baker is on vacation. The butcher does not sell milk. There is no milk at the supermarket.  There is gasoline in the car and it will take 2 gallons to get to the supermarket, which is 6 miles away. A bottle of water is in the center console. The gas tank is full of gasoline.  There is one quart left in the jug.  The jug is one-third full. The man's bicycle is rusted, but he wants to borrow it. The man is on a tight budget.  He does not want to spend $1 for transportation, but he must get milk.  The man lives in one of five communities. Which community will the man have to visit to get the needed quantity of milk?\n\n### Solution:\nThe man lives in community number 5, because the man does not own a vehicle. In addition, he cannot walk to the grocery store, because he only has $1 to spend on transportation. As stated in the question, the man needs to obtain a gallon of milk, which is 4 quarts. Each community has only 1 store/grocery store. In addition, the man lives in a community (1, 2, or 5) with a gas station, and a community (4) with a bike rental business. However, the gas station in community 5 has a single quart of milk, which is not enough for a gallon. Based on the premise that the man should not have to spend over $1 for transportation to the grocery shop, community 5 is not an option, because the man needs to spend 3 quarts of gasoline, which costs $3. In addition, the community's bike rental business can only serve one person at a time. Moreover the community has two gas stations. Therefore the only community (4) remaining is one with community 5. Because of the man's need for gasoline to get to the grocery, the man should be able to get to the gas station in community number 5 and get his gallon of milk.\n\n### Output:What is the difference in volume between a 1 pint and 2 pint?

{"text": "D\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n\n### Input : It's a mystery why some species of fishes have such strange colors.  It isn't for camouflage --  most fishes are either white, gray, or brown.  It may be partly for aesthetic reasons --  a pretty fish might find a little more willingness on the part of some females to allow him to fertilize her eggs!  The most interesting color changes are ones that occur in juveniles that are actually brightly colorful when they are young, but then become a duller color when they  grow up.  You could easily think that this is a way  of avoiding predators, but I believe there is far more to it than that.  For some reason, fishes like these that go through these radical changes in coloring as they mature are sometimes said to be \"fishes that change color\", though the actual colors they change to is usually not much of a change, just from bright to dull.  Choose one of these strange types of fishes.  Some will have 2 colors: answer A, choose B if the dull, adult form is white or gray and you answer D if it is black.

If Monday's route was four times as long as the Tuesday's route, the Wednesday route is twice as long as Monday's, and the result of her routine on Tuesday is 6, what is the exact result of her car pool route on Wednesday in miles?\n\n### Solution:\nThere are multiple steps to solving this problem. The first thing to note is that Mary travels four times as far on Mondays carpool route as she does on Mondays. Then, we can use the information provided in this question to determine how long each of the routes are. When we know the lengths of the routes, we can determine the exact answer to the problem.\nIf Mary's carpool route on Mondays is four times longer than her carpool route on Tuesdays, her carpool route on Monday will be approximately 16 miles long. Then her carpool route on Wednesdays will be approximately 64 miles long.\n\n### Input\nMary is 8 years older than her brother Fred, and 3 years younger than her mother Helen. Fred is 29 years old.

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructor Response:\nWe know that in general, if we write an expression for $n$ (and this is a specific case of $n = 3$), and we multiply it by itself twice, we get $n^2$. For example 7 to the third would be 7*7*(7-1) = 343.\nAn expression for $n$ is $8n + 1$. Substitute 3. This gives us $8*3 + 1 = 26 + 1 = 14$. So the function $f(n) = -7n + 3$ (as suggested), has this property $f(f(n)) = -7f(n) + 3$.

It was a rare and expensive automobile. It also had very low miles. He fixed it up for a lot of money. It ran well, but because it was old, he could not drive it more than a few hours without having to fix something.

This can be done by dividing 11000 dollars by 100 dollars because the amount of dollars is $11000 and the number of dollars per unit is $1.00. The decimal for the 1 will be.1 and you multiply the price of the item by that.  * The second step is finding how many of the item you are buying.  This can be done either by counting the quantity you are purchasing or by finding the number of times you buy that item. In this case, 100 can be bought 10 times which means you multiply 10 by the 1(price per unit) because you want to know the amount.  * Finally you need to divide the amount of items by the price of the items.  The amount of items divided into the 1(price for item).  1 *.1 does not equal (10 *.1) when you do this in your case(50 *.1). So the answer is 50.\n\n### Input 5. A man makes $300 dollars a week.

It is a simple process to determine the specific purpose of building in the name.\n\nThe college is not likely to construct a building for fraternities, so the answer must not be B.   In addition, A, C, and D would have additional words, \"fraternity\", \"campus\", and \"city\" in the name, so A, C, and would not be appropriate.   \nIn addition, A, C and D include the word \"building\" as part of their names, which makes a possible confusion if both the billionaire donor and campus building are \"buildings\" in the same sense.  \nThere is much less potential for confusion with the names B and E, as both are for \"buildings\". The name of the building is known by who provided the funding, and there is a single-word name for the building that is different in the two. \n\nChoices E and B are valid. The building is obviously a \"building\", as that is its function to provide space. In addition, the building is named for its main donor.\n\nFor the building to be named for a single person, is the name to be either the man's last name, or a compound last name? In this case, the man's name is not compound, so the answer must be E.\n\n### Input\n\nInput: A chicken and a hen have exactly the same set of traits.

{"text": "> When Sarah realized the only time to leave the house was noon, she decided that she was not in the mood to go out in the hot afternoon sun so she was staying in the house.\n\n### Input\nAnne's dilemma is that her family is stuck on an island that is in a state of decline. The island has a population of 50,000 citizens. It currently has two supermarkets and one cash-only gas station. The gas station owner announced that he was going to open the town's second supermarket. Everyone in town was excited, but after two days, no customers showed up. The gas station owner is furious. Annie has a dilemma. Will the new supermarket save the town from doom or will it close quickly because there is no demand?\n\n### Response\n\n* Anne has no dilemma. The gas station owner must have not been able to build the supermarket. He had nothing before and now, he has nothing. So if he could not build a supermarket, he cannot open a second supermarket.\n\n### Dilemma:\nYou see a box containing 5 different items. You are allowed to take 2 of the items from the box. But you can only look in the box once and you cannot look in the box again to look for the answer to your dilemma. What is your dilemma and what is the answer?\n\n### Answer:\nI'll answer this in a step-by-step manner:\n* Step 1: Ask a colleague (friend, spouse, etc.) to look in the box to check that that there are actually 5 different items.\n* Step 2: Ask the colleague or anyone else to choose 2 of the items that are in the box.\n* Step 3: Now, open the box yourself and look at the items inside. If you do not see any of the 2 items you asked the person to choose, then you are in dilemma. Choose two other items in the box (in Step 3) and you will see that they are exactly the same as the items the person in Step 2 choose.\n\n### Summary:\n\nSummary: 5 people each choose 2 of the same item in the middle of the ocean.", "answer": "A: early morning"}
{"text": "My grandpa was illiterate and had never learned to read or write any languages. So, I wanted to spend some quality time with him helping him to read and write.\nThough, I had made many previous unsuccessful attempts in the past, I thought that I would give it one more shot, and decided to go through the corrective actions, and try some harder methods.\n\nFor a start, I bought him a couple of books, that had lots of pictures, and he could just choose to read the words aloud with a lot of emphasis, or just point to the pictures. Then, I had a few picture books, and made him practice drawing the pictures. He didn\u2019t like reading and he didn\u2019t enjoy the task of writing either.\n\nSo, I made him practice some letter sounds instead. He enjoyed the task as well as he used to imitate the sound of the alphabet. I realized, that I needed to make the task fun for him instead of boring. I gave him a few stickers, that I would put on the walls, and he enjoyed drawing the stickers on his own. Then, we made his own stickers, and practiced some new ways of putting it on the walls, as well as drawing the letter sounds on his own.\n\nIt took me several days of practice to get him learn the concept of reading a few letters. He wanted to continue, and I told him to practice writing the words. He was eager enough, but couldn't write it down.\n\nSo, we bought him a pencil and a paper, and I got my friends to teach him how to write with the pen. It was a good job, and after several attempts, he started practicing and wrote his first word on the paper.\n\nAfter it, I bought him some books, that had lots and lots of letters, and numbers, and he took some time to start reading. I continued to practice with him, and he would write letters on paper. \n\nSo, when he was done reading a book, I would ask him to draw that character in the book. And he would do it after some time practicing with me.\n\nAfter a week, he used to practice a full day with me. Later when I got busy, he used to practice reading on his own.", "answer": "D: illiterate"}

The child is in a situation where it doesn't have to think like adults, and that adults can't think like a child.

The child is happy\n3. The child is not worried and having fun\n\nWe can see in the question that the child is a happy child, it is not worried, and it is enjoying, so the correct options is A.

This is related to the person, but different from how the first question is related to it.\n\n### Inference Analysis:\nSo this time the question is again related directly to the person in the question. So we can see that the person should be in a relaxed emotional state. We can see that the person is doing something that keeps him relaxed. It is not that he has to do anything, the person does not like to spend a long time, and he just does it for the sake of it to a limited length.\n\n### Question :\n\n### Response Analysis :\nIf we are comparing the questions we", "answer": "A: laugh"}

How Much Should You Invest in Inventory at the Start of Business? If you want to make an accurate cost estimate, you must be able to estimate inventory turnover and gross margin. You should take a hard look at how many times the average inventory is sold during your research phase.  One way to estimate this for an average product is to multiply the average retail sales price by 1.20 and estimate the quantity sold. This gives you an average inventory investment of $20,000. You must then make a gross margin estimate by looking at your total sales and the gross profit as percent of sales. Assuming 40% of your sales are gross, multiply the inventory by 40% and divide your estimated gross profits.  This gives an estimate of gross margin dollars.  Since gross margins can differ substantially from product to product and may change over time, you may wish to use a range for your gross margin estimate. You should also keep in mind that your gross margin estimate will be based on an estimate of your inventory.  \n\n## Topic2:How Much Should You Invest In Inventory?You should take a hard look in how many times the average invetory is sold during your reasearch fase.One way to estimae this for an average", "answer": "B: rhythmic movement"}

Because in Python, `True` is simply just the representation of True and `False` is simply the representation of False. That's why `bool(False)` would be False.\n\nIf you'll notice, both `y` and `answers` are lists. In this case, `answers.sort()` takes the values out of the list `answers` and puts them into a new list. Hence, the new list `answers` is no longer ordered according to the original list by default and because `False` is in the result, `answers` is the same as the result.\n\nTo help prevent against misunderstandings about True and False in Python, you can use the boolean `is` function to find out whether the value `x` has any relationship with the True or False.\n\nUsing `is` in our previous example: `answers.sort().is_empty()`\n\n### Input 2:\nBelow is an instruction that describes an example.

{"text": "Answer: E\n\n### Explanation:There are 5 choices for answers. The first is A - meadow, the second is B- cupboard, the third is C- shed, the fourth is D- mail box, and the fifth is E- cellar. So you can cross out D and E, and you are left only with A, B and C. If you are afraid of spider, then you should avoid cellar and shed. But you can\u2019t avoid mail box. Mail is a method of delivery, and the cellar and shed are places for delivery.\n\n### InputThe number of marbles that Jack has in his box equals half the number of marbles that Jill has. If half of the difference between the number of marbles they have equals 9, how many marbles does Jill have?\n\n### ResponseAnswer: Answer D (21).\n\n### Explanaition The equation of Jack's box (number of marbles) and Jill's box (number-of-marbles) can be expressed as follows: NumberOfJack'sBox = 1/2 * NumberOfJill'sBox Substituting the equation for Jill's box into the same equation for Jack's box, we get half (1/2) of the difference (difference of numbers) of the two box. We found that the half of the difference (differnce) of the two boxes is 9. Therefore, we want to subtract 9 from half the number of marbels Jill is holding. The result is 10, which can be simplified to 5. Therefore 5/2 is 21 in number of marbles Jill is holding.\n\n### OutputThe number of marbles equals half the number of students who don\u2019t bring their books\n\n### ExpectationIf there are 400 students in a math class, and 50 of them don\u2019t  bring their books to class, how many of the remaining 350 students bring their book?\n\n### ExactOutputAnswer B (185)\n\n### ExpectedOutputAnswer C (370)\n\n### CorrectedOutputAnswer A (185)", "answer": "E: cellar"}

So if the area is 8 by 4, you would think of it as 4 by 8. So the area is 8 times 6 = 48 feet^2. If the area is 16-foot wide, then it is 16 by 8 = 128 feet^2. It is $8 per square foot for each side you build. So if it is 8 feet wide by 6 feet long, then it is 48 feet^ by 6 feet^ = 288 square feet^. Each side of the fence has 8 feet of height in it, or 8 feet^2. So, the perimeter is 8 times 288 feet = 2,288 feet by 8 feet times 6 feet = 1,452 feet^3. Therefore, the height of one side is 128.\n\n### Input(Part2):What does a 10 foot side be put on the fence compared to the other sides of the fence?\n\n### Input Part2, response is C : When the fence is 10 feet, it is $80 per square foot.\n\n### Part 2 : Is an equal amount paid to hire a worker to build a 8 by 5 foot fence?\nPart 2 response is C. The side of the fence by the 5 foot is 1250, but when the height is equal to the side, then this side is 1000.\n\n### What does this answer mean?\n1. A rectangle has 8x6 feet = 48 total square feet\n2. The f", "answer": "C: care for children"}

The remaining options are not possible scenarios.\n\n### Input The value of the triangle is equal to the sums of two adjacent sides.  What is the value of the smallest triangle?\n\n### Response The sum of two adjacent sides that form a triangle is its value. If the triangle is the smallest possible, the sides of the triangle must be adjacent to each other. There are 3 types of triangles.  Their names are isosceles, scalene and equilateral. The isosceles and equilateral triangles share some characteristics. One side of an isosceles triangle shares the same value as the adjacent sides. The second side of an isoscalasles triangle is equal to, or greater than, the value of two adjacent sides.\n\n### For example, if the value of a given triangle is 18, it can only be a scalene triangle.  This occurs because the sum of two sides is equal to the third side.  It cannot be the case that the two sides (side1 and side2) are equal.  If we look at the other triangles that have a value of 18, it becomes evident that only the triangle shown can have these characteristics.  If we look closer at our initial condition (the smallest triangle), we can see the triangle in question.\n\n## Instructions:Input 14 numbers from one to 14.

When the French sailors returned to their country, they brought the instrument with them, and it was known as 'gabal'. Then the instrument was brought to America in the late nineteenth century by black slaves in West Indian Islands in exchange for tobacco that was smuggled from America. Since slaves were not allowed their own instruments, they would secretly make them inside barrels. \n\n### Insturction:\nWrite a response that appropriately answers the question.\n\n## Input 2: \nAnswer:  B\n\n### Demoystration\n - The banjo was first documented in the 16th century in the Islamic Republic Of The Gambia on the West Coast of Africa.  It was a simple instrument, with one string, tuned like a string on a violin. The next version was an 5 stringed African instrument, used in the united states. The three stringed banjo we now know that is popular in the west coast of America was invented in the first quarter of the nineteenth century. \n\n## Demystification:\nThe banjo was created in West Africa by slaves, but it is more famous in United States, and not in the United States Of America.  It is not famous among nice people but for African American people.\n\nQuestion 3: \nHow does the banjo sound?", "answer": "D: united states"}

{"text": "E\n\n### Input:\"Learning languages is hard\" is actually true.  In order to communicate smoothly, you must understand what someone has said and be understood.  Even in a situation of full immersion, we struggle to understand what we miss, and we may struggle to communicate our ideas back, which leads us to overthinking and frustration.  A lot of these mistakes come from our cognition.  As humans, we think in 3-D and see through 5 senses (although some people say they can see with touch, but that is more a metaphor).  In the digital world where we use computer, keyboard and mouse as our interface to our virtual worlds, only one of these five senses makes it into our daily experience: the sense of touch.\n\nThus, we struggle to translate the way we think in 3 dimensions into the digital world where we only experience things through a keyboard with 26 individual, fixed keys.  It is like speaking a language from your region and then trying to explain concepts into that language to people from a different region who don't understand your language.  Sure, you can communicate basic, simple ideas but you can never get as deeply into the concepts as someone from that region can.\n\nFurthermore, we experience miscommunications or even misunderstandings as frustrating.  This happens because our experience is not always interpreted in the same way as a person from another culture may interpret it.  Someone from a different background may interpret something as threatening or provocative when it has no such connotation to us.  Therefore, if we misunderstand something, that misunderstanding might become a big deal to us.\n\nIf we experience these things, we are likely to become overthinking.  Overtime we might end up overthinking our actions without realizing it.  \n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Instruction:Answer the questions.\n \n### Question:1.

Choices A:Deceptive B: Altruistic  C: Stupid  D: Aggressive E: Agressive\n\n## Answer: \nI have chosen to answer that people are purposefully harming other as they are exhibiting the trait of being deceptive. These people are deceptive as they have said they can help others but actually they are only concerned with their own interests.  They want to help others because they are selfish and are only using help to take from other people without having any intention to give. One can tell that these people are exhibiting the trait traits because they have claimed that they are altruistic but their behavior reveals the opposite. It has been revealed that this people are actually being purposefully harming because they are telling lies to people and this means that they are manipulating people for their own gain. They have also pretended to help people in order to gain from them. They have also told lie to hurt people and so they have made people suffer. By helping others, they are only getting benefits from their actions and do not consider people who they have helped since these people are only a means to make themselves happy. This suggests that the people exhibiting the traits towards people who they have been harming are exhibiting deceptive trait because they are being used by these people and they have not benefitted at all from such a relationship.\n\n### Input:\"There is a 62% chance of rain tomorrow and 58% chance of rain on Saturday.

You are going to have to pay 50% more 5 additional times ( 5 * 50% ). To add this up you will have to multiply the number in each of the brackets (5+5+5+5) which would give the answer 25. 25% is equal to * 2 so you would end up paying 5 more than half the cost originally.

{"text": "D\n\n### Input : Write a function that takes 4 arguments, then returns the largest of them. Then, use that function to evaluate the input `5`\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question in three ways.\n\n### First Solution:\n1. The value of a variable is x and the value of b is 2. The value returned by function f is 3 and the value of a is 1. We have: The maximum value is `3 * 2` which equals 3+3*2 which equals 3+1 which equals 4.\n\n### Second Solution :\n1. The value returned by the function f is: 3+1 which is 4.\n2. We start by evaluating x, which gives us: `2*1`. From there, we go down the left stack: `f(5-1)`, and since `3-1` is 2, we take 2, and get: `2*2-1`. Now, we take 2 from the right stack, which is `1`, and now we have: `2*2+1`.\n3. We do the same process with the right stack. `b*2-1` now gives us: `2` and `a*2+1` gives us: `1` which means: `2*2`.\n4. Then, we do the same process with a and we have: `1*2`.\n\n### Third Solution :\n1. Since the maximum value is: `2*(f(a)*5)`, which is: 10, \nwe can evaluate it by multiplying 10 by 2, which gives us: 20.\n\n2. First, the maximum value is: F(a) * 5 * 2. We can evaluate that as: `f(a) * 10 * 2`. The first 10 we do not need to evaluate, so we do the same process for f(a) * 2. We need to do this first, since 2 is smaller than 10. The process for this is below:\n\n3. Since the maximum value that we need to evaluate is: `f(a)*2`, we start by evaluating the variable: `f(a)`.

{"text": "A: Toy Store\n\n#### Explanation:\nBilly\u2019s mother tripped over the stuffed animal and complained about Billy leaving his things in places where people are likely to trip over them. Because the stuffed animal was on the floor, a logical choice is that it was in the family room. Family rooms have many surfaces to collect clutter, such as shelves, tables with piles of books, couches, and chairs with clothes, or, the floor.\n\nBilly\u2019s family room is where the things that people are likely to trip, fall, bump into, break, or step in are stored. People do not normally step into a family room\u2014it\u2019s used for gathering around the television screen, listening to music, etc. The same things that you would trip over in a family room, you would also trip over if it is out on the floor in the living room. And while many people are likely to trip on the floor of the family room, there are likely to be fewer than the number of people stepping into a house.\n\nIn choosing a place to leave or store things that someone is likely to trip on, the logical choice is to store them upright rather than laying them on the surface of the family room floor. The family room floor should only be used for carpeting, which helps people to avoid slipping and falling.\n\n### Input\n```\nA family of six is planning to go to the grocery store.

X = 2Y because the cost of the CD is double the cost for the download.  If the cost for the CD is $0.82 more than the cost of the CD, 0.81, then the cost of the CD equals (2Y + 0.81) thus X = 2Y + 0...81.\n\nY =.81/2 =.405\n\nX = 2 *.405 = $0.81\n\n### Input:(1.

They flew through different types of clouds and they decided to keep going.\n\nHowever, after a while, the Lost Boys started to have trouble breathing and they thought this was odd.

{"text": "Answer the question \n\n### Explanation:\n1. If Hurley is $14$ years old, this will be 20 years from now, when he is $40$ years old.\n1. If the cost of a car is $17$ $0$ dollars, and the cost is split 6 ways, each person's cost is $17$ divided by $6$, or $2.83$  dollars.  If you subtract the cost of car wash, each person's share was $2.83-0.50=2.33$.    After paying for the car wash, every person pays $15-17$ = $-2$ dollars.\n1. For every page that he reads, Pablo earns 1 cent.  There are 150 pages in a book.  At 1 cent per page, Pablo will earn $15$ cents per book. If he reads a book, he plans to save 40 cents: $15-40=15$.  Now there are books that he can read that have 300 pages each, for a total of 3 books that he would buy, and only 1 that he would read.  In that case, he would save $15+$300=$315$(with 3 additional books that he would not buy and read, but which he would still pay $15$ to buy).\n1. If $x+y+z=28$, then $x+y+y+z=48$. If $x+x+x+x=16$, then $x+x+y+z-48$. Subtract the equations to get $2x+y+z+8=82$.  $8x$ is $80$ dollars from $y$ and $z$ together (or $80+$8=88).  $3y$ is $72$ dollars from $x$ and $z$ (or $72+15=87$).  Finally, $z$ is $72-4=68$.  Thus, $88+72+68=228$. Thus, $x=21$.\n1. 6 books cost $70$ dollars.  $6\\", "answer": "B: gaining knowledge"}

So, 5 for $2 means each apple will cost $0.50 and $5 for $2.00 means the 5th apple will be $0.50.

While C is a common way to refer to a park if it's in the southern hemisphere due to parks having a \"circle\" and a \"line\", \n> \n> this statement could be used because a lot of animals can be found, such as a dog, cats, pigs(pork), and any other animals in the woods. There is a chance the statement was made in a certain way to refer to a place where you can buy animals, as John is very careful to avoid places with animal abuse and parking lots could have animals in them, as they are a great place to park. In a woodland, the animals would live in harmony without any abuse, but it would be strange to refer to a specific place in a certain way unless your writing poetry.

Then each pound is about 1.3 ounces, thus each person\u2019s weight is 400/2 = 200 ounces. Each person weighs 5.5 pounds.  Let us assume that each couch bed takes 4 ounces to fold/ unfold. Thus, it takes about 2 hours to fold/ unfold the couch bed.\n\nThen, when the couch bed is open it occupies about 800/3= 260 square feet. A garage in fact occupies only about 8 ounces to open/ close the door, thus the garage takes about half an hour to open/close the door (8 (gallons) multiplied by half an hour). In terms of time garager\u2019s size is approximately smaller than the couch bed\u2019s size. Thus, the garage can\u2019t fit 4 people sleeping on a couch bed.\nNext we consider living room. For two people in a living room there are 400/3 = 134 acres to fold/unfold the sofa bed, which is approximately equal to the width of a 24\u00d74 or 96 feet. A house is quite larger than that. It is about 68.4 \u00d7 30.4 = 20,324 square feet in fact. To open/close a wooden door occupies about 96 ounces of work. Given the above mentioned sizes for sofa bed and house, we can see that a bed in a house takes at least twice as long to install/ uninstall than the couch bed in a garage does. So, two people sleeping on a sofa bed could fit in a house. Hence, there are no couch beds in a garage at home.\n\nNow we consider guest room. For two people a guest room takes about 400/1.3 = 300 acres to fold/ un-fold the sofa bed.  A guest\u2019s room in fact is about 776 square feet. To open/close the wood door it takes about 1", "answer": "E: basement"}

{"text": "B: piggy bank\n\n### Demand:Choose the correct option.\n\n### Input A pizza shop sells 20 pizzas last week. This week they sell 24 pizzas. When will they reach the point they sell half of what they sold the week before?\nA: One week from now B: Ten days from now C: Twenty-four days from now D: Three weeks from now\n\nOutput: It takes 24 days for the shop to sell half of the number of pizzas bought the week earlier.\n\n### Response B:\n\n### Explain how this method of using the number of days they've been in business could give you a rough idea of their sales volume.\n\n### Answer:\nThis question asks you to identify the part of the story that relates to business. The story relates to the point in time that a given event happened - 24 days after they had started business. If they were to sell twice as many during a certain week, the pizza store would need to increase business by 50%. It appears that the pizza restaurant was doing well enough that the weekly sales were a reasonable number. At the time the story is written, they had already sold 20 pizzes during the first week.\n\nThis method of understanding sales volume involves a ratio between the total amount of time elapsed since the business was started and the number of pizzes sold. The business needs to sell 48 more pizzas for each week until they reach the point where they were selling as many as in the first week. They could continue that approach and sell all 2048 pizzas 20 weeks from now, or they could continue to sell twice as much pizza each week, for a total of 115 more weeks.\n\nBy using this method, one could conclude the sales are strong enough that they could sell twice as much business during the week and continue to sell it that way for a long period. The sales volumes may be so high that they could make 48 times the first week's sales if they were to continue it for a little over another year. The ratio shows that when the shop was 20 week from starting the pizza shop, the weekly sales were 48 times what they were at the end of the first week.", "answer": "B: piggy bank"}

Write a recursive formula to calculate the change in temperature (100 meters above sea level) after each temperature change (1\u00b0C).\n2. Calculate the difference between each result to see what the temperature of the atmosphere is at 6oC.\n\n\n### InputThe pH scale (a logarithmic scale that runs from 0 to 14) is used to measure the level of acidity/alkalinity of an aqueous solution. A pH of zero could mean a highly acidic solution but would more likely mean the solution is so severely acidic that it is corroding. Write a program to calculate pH for a given number of moles of hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution by using the pH scale and your calculator.\n### Response\nA pH of zero could be a pH too low to measure but rather a pH too high to be measured.\n1. A pH 0 could be 10^0 = 1.0 * 10^-14 (pH 0 is not likely but it is possible)\n2. A pH 1 pH could be 10 * 10^0-2 * 10^-2 (pH 1 is unlikely but possible)\n\n### Demostration:\nThe pH scale is a log scale based on the number of moles of H+ ions in a solution.\n1. A \"0\" reading on pH means there are many H+ ions.\n2. 0 < pH < 4 is acidic.\n3. - The pH scale gets more negative as it goes higher meaning the solution became more alkaline. The pH = pOH but the number of moles in the solution is negative.\n4. After pH = -4, the scale gets much higher because the pOH must be the negative of a positive number.\n5. The negative scale is because of how water \"turns\" or dissolves metal into aqueous solution. Water has a slight affinity", "answer": "B: expend energy"}

An additional topping costs $1.50. The price of 3 toppings is $3.98 more than the cost of 1 topping. How can I solve this question?\n\n### Response\nThe first step of this problem is to simplify. The cost of 1 toppings costs $15.80. Now the additional toppings cost 3 more than $15.8. The cost of 3 additional toppings is $46.4. The cost of ordering pizza is $11.4. Now, use the difference between the cost of 3 toppings and the cost of ordering a pizza to solve the question. The 51.6 costs equal to 80% of pizza price. Now, use the cost of 350% of pizza to figure out how much additional toppings cost. $12.08 is the price of 350%. The last step is to subtract $15.8 to figure out the answer. $6.74 is the amount of additional topping for $18.35.\n\n### Input\nThe cost of 80 percent of a pizza is 8 dollars. This means each topping costs \n50 cents more than 2 percent of the cost of the pizza. Use the previous information to find a price of the pizza.\n\n### Response \nThe price of a pizza is one dollar less than seven percent of the pizza costs. The pizza costs $7. Subtract $8.50 and the toppings cost 50 cents. Therefore, the toppings cost $0.50 each.", "answer": "E: rain forest"}

{"text": "Answer: A: new hampsire\n\n### Instructions: You are a famous writer. You like to write on a desktop computer, which requires a lot of electricity. Your current desk can support the entire town of Dover while maintaining its current shape. There is a shortage of electricity in Dover. You can\u2019t have more than 50% of your town\u2019s energy. This week, your energy supplier, New England Power, offers you the chance to move from your large, heavy desktop to a smaller laptop. It will reduce its energy output to your desk by about 60%.  A New England Power representative explains how much energy each person in town requires. Each resident\u2019s electricity can be represented as a number between 1 and 100. If there are 100 people in Dover, the total number of people\u2019s energy usage must add up to 50. Each week, each resident will be asked to reduce their energy usage by 10% based on how much people have already reduced. If a person in Dover consumes 75, their usage must be reduced by 15%. After each week, the energy supply company will add a person to Dover, and adjust everyone\u2019s power usage accordingly.  The representative then explains that you can pick how much weight your desk can support. If you can support 65% of Dover\u2019s electricity, how big can your desk be?\n\n### Solution:\n\nAnswer: 2500 lb\n\nInput: You arrive at a party, and decide to have 5 cakes and 5 cookies, which total 710 calories.

Thus, we know that the price of the toy was $82.50 to begin:\n\nInitial toy price, $82.5\n\nBought for $82.5 - ($37.5 discount on toy from each discount)\n\nThis means that the toy initially cost $50, which is not an answer.\n\nYou will either get 8% of the price of the toys or just half an answer if you are off by around $330.99.\n\n\n### Explination\nYou need to calculate how much you got off the original price of the toy.

You can't use A as it's a manufacturing facility, nor can you use B because it's a school (learning is done there).   You also can't use C because it's a grocery store (sales are conducted there). The same goes for D because it's a plane and has nothing to do with manufacturing products.  A must be ruled out because it's a factory.   That leaves choices B, C, D and E.    You can't use B or C because they involve people and those people are not going to be making products (a manufacturing operation), so the answer is (D).\n\n### Input\nOne day, the children decide to play a game.

Now, the players agree to decide who goes first and then play the game, one player going first and each player taking turns, and each player making one move per turn until the game is over. Here are the rules:\n\n**Rule #1:** Each player chooses a starting square for their pawn. (Pick one black square, one white square, or one other color square.) (Each choice cannot be duplicated on the board.)\n\n**Rule #2:** Each pawn is moved only one space per move. (If a pawn is landed on an occupied square, then it must either jump over the piece that occupies the square or return to its own start square.)\n\n**Rule B:** Players try to take out the other players' pawns by jumping their pawns over them.

When people go to a football stadium, they do not look at the football stadium while they are there except from afar once in awhile for people who don't know how to use the Internet. They usually just look at their phones while at a football stadium.

{"text": "B\n\n### Reason:This is a very heavy game where players have to take on cards that are small and have to draw a card with a small paper attached to it. Players are given the lead when they draw the first card and win the game by playing all their cards before any other player can get rid of their cards. There are 800 possible combinations that could be used to play this game, but there are only 16 different cards in each set so you only have to match as many as 149 times before you can win the game. Because of this, it takes about 167 turns for each player to get their first turn and only 87 turns for them to get their second turn which means that most players will only have 12% chance of winning each time they sit down at the table and play this very heavy game where they draw very small papers attached to small cards every time they play because it takes so many hands before they can begin playing each time.The game requires a lot of time and effort to win and if each player draws 36 different cards every time which adds up to about 360 different combinations that are needed in order to play this very heavy game since there are only 80 different cards there will be 80 different combinations that are used to play this very heavy card game which means that players will only need about 5 hands before they are able to find the right combinations to play because each player will have very high odds of winning each time they try to play this heavy card game since there are so many different combinations that are used in order to play this heavy card The game takes about 11 plays to decide who wins because of how evenly matched the games are.\n\n### Inputs:An orange is worth $3.

If you want to have $8 for yourself, then you should buy one of each fruit because that is what pays for the price with which you can buy all three of them.

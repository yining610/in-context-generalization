Each week, you camp 1/6 of the way across the United States from the previous week. Each week, you eat two ounces of cheese and 700 calories of food. How much weight will you gain in a week?\n\n### Response\uff1a\nThe correct amount of weight you will gain is 7/6 pounds per week because you are camping 1/6 of a mile away each week.  Each week you eat 1/6 of your calories, so you gain no weight.\n\n### Explanation of the correct answer:\nIt will take you 6 weeks to get to the other end of the country. You eat 700 cal from groceries. At 700 cal/week, it will take you 42 weeks. You eat 1440 cal per month since you double it after 3 months. It will take you 31 days to double your groceries in store. It takes you 31 days on the side to get all the groceries you need.

It's only the selection.\n- Some are more difficult than others but even multiple choice is not that complicated. If you keep doing these, you will get them right.\n\n### Submission Rules\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.  Remember to save your completed tasks as a word document before submitting it.\nIf you are unsure about multiple choice answers, then it is important to use a scoring system. First, count how many correct answers are chosen. For example, if a user chose four options from five that have the correct answers, then it's a score of 80%. Calculate that score. Then divide it by 100 and subtract it from 1, so, in this case, it equals 8 minus 8 divided by 100, which equals 0.2. If the user chooses more correctly, then the score will be smaller. And if the user gets a lot of answers wrong, then the score will also be smaller. Compare the submitted score with the correct score, and there is the result.\n\n### Feedback\n- Don't read the comments.\n- There are more explanations than I can say here but if you're confused, there are plenty of articles describing how to do multiple choice or how to write the task.", "answer": "B: symphony"}

The stimulus tells us that the man is cleaning clothes for a date. If he was cleaning clothes for a special occasion, the likeliest event would be a date or a job interview. If the special occasion was a date, we can assume that he is trying to impress his date, thereby attracting her attention to him. As such, it is most likely that he will be clean and neat on the date, not looking drab and old. In this scenario, the correct answer is A, since he will be looking to attract his date.\n\n### Input : A bird can fly 12 yards for every 4 seconds it runs.

The correct answer, A, is the one that will allow him to achieve this goal since it is most likely that if the man is dressed up nicely, his date will be looking at his outfit, but may not focus on his personality. Choice B would suggest a clean personality, but clothing does not speak of an individual's strength of character. Choice D would suggest a personality that may be inappropriate, so we can eliminate this choice. Choice E does not provide us with much information, so it is best to eliminate this choice.\n\n###Input: \nThe person who wrote this sentence is writing about", "answer": "D: attractive appearance"}

How long would it take for the cow to eat all the food?\n\nAnswer: B for 42 days\n\n### Solution1\n\nThe cow weigh 1600 lbs, so 1600 is divided by 20 to get 80, and 80 is multiplied by 24 to get 1920.

This means that 12.2 hours (the first 12 hours) are subtracted from 23.1 hours. When we subtract, the extra.1 becomes.2. So the answer in terms of extra hours is.2, which is equivalent to.2 x 1440 = 288 extra minutes. Because there are 60 minutes in an hour, that means minutes is is equivalent to hours. So the answer is 288 x 1.5 = 432 hours. The question then asks how much less he or she spends on other days, since.432 hours are less. The extra.432 hours is equivalent to.432 x 1400 = 618.8 extra minutes. Because 60 minutes make up 1 hour, that means.6188 or 618.7 extra minutes is equivalent to 12.19 extra hours. That is why our answer is 12.2-12.19 = 12-12.2 = -.2.\n\n### Note:This question is answered in the wrong order. What is meant by \"hours less\" is that they are subtracting. The actual answer is 23 (incorrectly rounded to 23.1) hours, minus (23-12) 11.1 hours.\n\n### Example:I spent 12 hours last weekend cleaning my room.

Schools in residential areas would be loud and would disturb the residents.\n\n**What is the correct answer?**\n\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple select question.\n\n## 1. What is the definition of a prime number?\n- A prime factor of a positive integer is a positive integer that can be multiplied by itself to form the original integer.\n- A prime number is a positive number whose only non-zero factors are itself and the number one.\n\n### Example:\n\n### Input \nA: The number 17 is a prime number. For an integer to be a prime number, it cannot be divided by anything except for itself or by 1. \nB: False, any multiple of any number is also a prime number. Take the number 3. A number can also be prime if it is divisible by only itself and 1.\nC: No, 9 and 10 are prime numbers.\n\n### Response \nThe best response for this problem is Choice B. \n\n## 2. Give a simple example of the GCF of prime numbers.\nThe greatest common factor (GCF) of a set of primes is the number that, by dividing each of the numbers in the set by itself only, leaves the same integer as a result on each division.  \nTherefore, GCF(5, 47) = 7 as the factors of 1 are 3, 1, and 3. Therefore, 8 is the GCF of 5 and 47. The GCF only considers prime numbers.\n\n\n## 3. What is the factorial function?\nA number multiplied by another number multiplied by itself that number of times.\nThe formula is: n x (n-1)... 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 where n is the highest exponent. For n = 4, the formula is: 4 x 3\n\n## 4. What is the factorization of the sum 36?\nThe number 36 can be broken down into its prime factors and its prime factorization is: 2 x 2 x 3", "answer": "A: residential neighborhood"}

{"text": "While we often associate fear with nervousness or anxiety, but there is one specific emotion that is usually paired with \"feeling wet\" - fear.\n\n### Explain:We were given two choices that have something in common and asked to choose the correct one. \nFear, in this case, would be an emotion that would cause us to sweat, urinate, and feel wet. While urinating is the easiest to notice as it happens externally, people tend to sweat more when they feel fearful.  Since urination and sweating are external actions, it's easy for some people to feel that they might urinate themselves during fear.  However, in my opinion, the correct answer is B. \n\n### Why:The other choices are not the right one as they don't associate with \"wet\" (except for A, but it's more based on what's usually paired with \"fear\" in real life).  The correct answer, \"swimming\", is more commonly used to \"feel\" wet (at least in the US).\nIf a person swims for a long enough duration, they will most likely become wet from sweating.  Additionally, the only choice that might be somewhat of a good answer would be C - fighting.  In my opinion, fighting wouldn't be associated with \"wet\", as it's more of a physical reaction (which is not \"wet\"). \n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is \"B - swimming\" as swimming is most commonly used to feel \"wet\".", "answer": "E: urinate"}

What city does Ali live in? Choices:  F: Berlin Germany. B: London England. E: Toronto Canada. A: Chicago USA\n\nResponse:The 10th gear is the maximum gear in a car. It is called 'overdrive'. So if the car has 10 gears, there will be an odd number of gears between 1st and 10th. The first gear has no teeth (only a single tooth makes a wheel rotate). The second gear has one tooth (counting from no tooth to the next tooth). The next number of teeth would be 2 teeth. Counting from 1 to 10, we can see that there is an odd number of teeth i.e. odd gears so the car with 10th gears is used by the European country i.e. Ali belongs to Europe. There would be only 4 gears between 10th and 0th, which means 4 gears have been removed from the gears which has more gears, that is, he belongs to America.

So the next number is 2. The third number in that series is 3. The fourth number in the sequence, the fourth term, is 4.\n\n### Summary \n* All of the first four numbers are prime.\n* After the first four the next number is prime\n* The fifth number is twice the fourth\n* The fifth number equals the number of letters in the first word of the phrase.\n\n### \n\n### Input\nYou have a rectangular table and you want to put down 3 candies of 9 inches each length.

A 9 inch candy can be put anywhere on the length of the table (0 to 10). So 3 can be put anywhere from 0 to 3. This means that there are 3 spaces left once the candies are put down. This is the answer.\n\n### Avoid:\n* Don't think about the number of candies. Just think about putting things down on the table.\n* Don't look at numbers for more than one step in advance.

The amount of money on one is 2 times as much as the amount of money on another. If I give one of them to my mom, I will give her at least $4. After giving them to my mom, one of them has a greater value. The other has a smaller value. Which of the two coins is worth more?\n\n### Demand:\nIn the above situation, you have two coins. One of the coins is worth twice that of the other. A coin (which we\u2019ll call a penny) is worth one cent. (In real life, the cent is worth much, much less than a cent.) We call the other coin a nickel (because it is worth 5 cents). So you have a penny and a nickel. Each coin cost $10, so you own a quarter. That leaves you with 3 nickels and 3 pennies. Now you need to donate $4 to charity. So you give money in the following amounts:\n\nGive a nickel to charity. You are left with two nickels and four pennies.\n\nGive one of the nickels to your Mom. You are left with three nickels and two pennies.\nWe already gave charity 4 cents, so that leaves us with one penny and one nickel. The nickel is worth 5 times as much as the penny, so the nickel is clearly worth more. It is therefore worth more than the penny. So the nickel is the more valuable coin.\n\n![Question](./assets/Question.png)\n![Response](./assets/Response.png)", "answer": "D: drink coffee"}

(Note: 50% * 0.85 = x)\n\n### Solution:\n(Note: it may seem like a hard question to do in a very short time, but if we notice the question carefully, the answer is really simple to solve.)\n\n85% off  = (100-x) / 100\n50% = (50-x) /100\n\nThis shows that (50-x)/100 is equal to 50%.\n\nThen, solving the two equation simultaneously, we have\n\n50-x=50\nx=0\n\nHence, the given discount will be 0%, when we subtracted 50% discount already given to us. Since the first 50% is free, the second discount will make the given question 0.\n\nTherefore, the discount given will be 0% on 85% of the given food.", "answer": "C: spinning wheel"}

OOPs\n\n### Instuction:Using only Object-Oriented concepts (classes and methods) in C#, write some code.\n\n### Solve it!:\n- Write a C++ class named MathCalculator. This class has properties such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with the get and set accessors. Also, the class has a constructor that takes a number that is used as the starting value of the calculations.\n\n- Write a method named Increase that uses the properties of your MathCalculator to increment the value by 1. Call your method from Main. Also, write a method named Add, which overrides addition, such that it increments the value by 3. Write a method named Subtract, which overrides the subtract method, such that it subtracts 2 from the value. Finally, write a method named DoubleSubtract, which over-rides subtraction by 3.\n\n## 5. Decorate\n\nIn this exercise, you'll examine your code and determine whether it is well-executed. Consider the question below. Does it have to do with a problem in the code, or is it a commentary on the writing? If someone else saw this line of code, what response would they typically have to it?\n\n### Instusion:Modify the above line of code so that it is clear instead of confusing.\n\n### Answers:\n```C#\n\n```\n\n### Instriction:Use your imagination and your knowledge of C++ to decorate the above code.\n\n```C#\nusing System;\nnamespace", "answer": "C: own family"}

Since a plane can get more than 388 m/h, the speed must more then 388 m/(2*1). For an answer that can express 236 m/h we have to subtract 8. 388-8=370.333 m/h.

They told me that I needed to take responsibility for that mistake. I made a promise to myself that if I ever find myself in the same situation, I would take a more active role in rectifying the problem. <n><n>A year ago, a friend and I moved into our first ever roommate situation. Unfortunately, it was not a successful experience. Due to personal differences, and my ineptitude in communication, our roommate relationship was strained. I learned a lot from the experience, but I also still have some regrets. I regret the way our first conversation with our roommate went. I regret not talking more upfront about how I felt about some of the changes that we were going to have to make to the living situation (like cleaning more often.) However, I think I'm glad I took my responsibility in finding a new roommate (or three of us going our separate ways) seriously.<n><n>### Input :<n>Write a response to the following prompt.<n><n>I learned a lot from teaching for the first time.

I learned more about patience for those who don't listen, and those who do. As well as a great deal of respect. I gained a great deal of respect for fellow teachers as I took a backseat for a very long while, and I am now just a senior in high school, working to graduate. As the year went on, I learned to be a more patient mentor, as I had a lot of students who asked me questions and looked for my guidance, and who then didn't come back for the advice or help. However, I also found that just like being a good teacher, it was a lot of commitment and sacrifice, and I would find

Choices:  A: cause death B: cause bleeding C: falling down D: become infected E: claim insurance<n><n>### Response:		E: The worst possible outcome of an injury is to suffer death. While not everyone will die as a consequence of an injury, the possibility of dying is always to be considered in the event one is hurt. While there are many different forms of injury, from cuts to broken bones to head injuries, some forms of injuries are worse than others. While all serious injuries will almost certainly cause some bleeding of fluids in the body, some injuries do not allow for proper healing of the injury site, which will result in death. All injuries will require medical attention to prevent infection in the wound. Some forms of serious injury will result in the need for an amputation of at least one limb, which is also considered a life changing injury. It is almost always the case that a medical insurance claim will be made as a result of a traumatic injury. The claim is often the financial lifeline to paying for the medical attention required to heal from the injury.<n>

If you buy two movies at that rate every night, how long will it take to afford your own movie theater?<n><n>Answer: 720 days. $84 in the first place to begin with, and $1.6 is the average each movie that makes it to 7 days.

I wanted to know if one or more would show up. I put the name of my four cats on one card and the names of my two friends on another. When I chose a card, whatever two names I got were the ones I was going to watch. (2) The first card I pulled had my cat’s name and one of my friend’s names. I was disappointed because I still had to look for my other two cats. (3) The second card I pulled had my two cats’ name and one of my friends’ name. I was pleased because I would not have to go find my cat. (4) I asked a third friend to watch my two cats. I was concerned because two had already been found and I only had one cat left.<n><n>### Response:(1) If you knew who was watching your cats beforehand, how could you be disappointed that you had to find your other two cats?<n><n>### Solution:<n>You asked two friends to watch your cats, so you had no way of knowing which names would be on the cards once you pulled out cards. Therefore, you do not know who was going to watch your cat until you pull your cards. Therefore, you would be disappointed if you found your other two cats, because you would still not know which cards you pulled that day and you would have to look for your cat once again.<n><n>The same logic applies to the second card, where you found one cat and your other friend. Since you still didn't know which card you pulled and your other cat was already found, you cannot be pleased.<n><n>With a third friend watching your two cats, you have already found both of your cats from the first and second cards. However, since you do not know who will watch your cats and you have already found both, you cannot be concerned that you would have to find your last cat again.<n><n>### Question:Can the problem be solved if you have more than 8 cards?<n><n>### Answer:<n>Yes, the problem can be improved by having more than 8 cards, depending on how the cards are generated. For example,

Choices:  A: shake hands B: own property C: pay bills D: smoke E: talk to each other<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>  - If we were talking about dogs, we'd say that the first question is correct, and the second incorrect because they can't understand what a "boat" is, since they don't know what that means. Adult people usually are expected to pay bills.<n>  - I thought the first two questions are both incorrect because you have to ask the dog which property it owns instead of just saying "the difference between Doberman puppys and Schnauzer", it doesn't make sense to make a comment like that to a dog. Then, I realized it has something to do with numbers because you can only use numbers to do division and subtraction. Then, I realized the third one, it's not correct because it's missing the first answer, but I'm not quite sure how to answer the question, it would make more sense if the person ask me the answer and I'd give them the answer. Then, I thought the last question is correct because adult people are expected to talk to each other not just other adult people but every and anyone.<n>

The police ask him about the date that he claims to have seen the crime. He answers, "I honestly don't remember the date that I saw it."

Choices:  A: jar B: stick to fingers C: beehive D: stick to fingers E: farmer's market<n><n>### Response:		<n>If you want to buy honey for yourself or as a gift, going to a farmers market that sells honey is your best bet. You might see honey being sold from local beehives or from local apiaries. You probably won’t find the same honey in supermarkets. You’ll want to taste the honey from the glass before purchasing. Honey in stick form is easy for putting on toast, or melting on a cake.<n><n>### Input<n>You and your girlfriend want to get a gift for your friend. Her mother’s birthday is this week. She loves garden flowers. She also loves red flowers. She has a rose garden. She’ll be out of town this weekend, so you have one weekend to buy the gift. What time of flowers should you get for your gift?<n><n>### Response<n>Since your friend’s mother loves garden flowers, if you bring her a bouquet of flowers that you got during the day, they will last for a long time. If you buy her a flower that you get at night, there’s no guarantee that it will make it to her birthday. As for the red flowers, if she collects red garden flowers, she may have already decorated her home for her birthday. Since she is out of town this week, you may not be able to get her flowers from her garden for her birthday. Also, red flowers tend to only last about a week and a half. To honor her love of red flowers, you’d be better off giving her a piece of antique red jewelry.<n><n>### Example<n>For these tasks, the choice that correctly completes the request is also provided.<n><n>### This was an example to help you with the instructions.<n>1.

On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Answer: 54<n><n>Input: Jordan and Perry took a boat out to the lake to go fishing on a Monday morning. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:Where might a yard be tiny? Choices:  A: farmland B: neighborhood C: city D: property E: subdivision<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I see it is B the Neighborhood.<n><n>### The given input instructions are meant to assist you with the problem. However, they aren't intended to direct you to any particular way to solve the problem. To be specific, an easy method to determine the number of Schnauer Puppies is to subtract 9 Doberman puppys from the total original number of puppies.<n><n>### If the number of Dobernam puppys is 20, the answer is 55. Five less than the number will be subtracted from the number as the 20 minus five leaves 15 doberman puppys. In addition, five times 3 would result in the 15. It is important to add one to the number instead of subtracting one, since it is necessary to add on the remaining 10 of the number of 15. Finally, the answer would be 55 for the number of Schnurer puppys with 20 original Doberman pupps as the number.<n><n>### There are two ways to calculate the number of puppys that Dr. Banks gave away in the busiest month: counting the months or multiplying the remaining puppys by a ratio of 2/3 after subtracting the number of toothbushes given away 53 in January and the number of toothbraches given away in February. To find the average number of toothbrachs Dr. Banks gave to his patients in March using months, divide the number of toothbrashes given away by the number of 12 (the months) minus 2 (the number of toothbrasshes given away in February). To find the average number given away in March using a ratio, multiply the remaining toothbracbes times one third, and then subtracting the number given away in February and the number given in January. Adding the number of toothbrasches given way in January and February would yield the number given during the busiest month.<n><n>### To find the number left, the number subtracted needs to be added to itself, resulting in the double catch number. Therefore, there would be four fish remaining.<n>

Choices:  A: theater B: computer C: opera D: television E: concert<n><n>### Response:		<n>I'm not likely to find a program for a music concert, so the answer is A: theater.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>A program is used to see a list of showings in a theater in order to select one beforehand. You can watch a recorded show on a television set, and you can also look up a show by using a mobile application or a computer web browser.

Each of the seashells were sold for $1.2 dollars, and the following equations were applied for the parameters `m`, `n`, and `k` respectively. <n><n>For `m`: The number of seashells picked on Monday,  `m = 30`<n>For `n`:The number of seashells you are going to give to your customers, `n = 230`<n>For k: The number of seashills you're going to give away, the number of Monday picks, `k = 30` <n><n>So, the resulting value of `n` after applying the above equations to the function `sum_sales` in the main function is:<n>```js<n>    sum_sales(30, 230, 30)<n>```<n>Which, as you might remember from the beginning of the question, equals 54 dollars.<n><n>Note:  This would have actually been the best way of solving the problem,  but I decided to simplify the equations by skipping the multiplication of `2.4` which would result in selling `20` seashells of which the amount would have been `20 * 3` seashells.

It's a horrible thing to bring someone down and disturb their resting place. Construction sites are no place to excavations.

Choices:  A: nearest house B: workplace C: surface of earth D: office block E: his feet<n><n>### Response:		The office block was the correct choice according to the text, so choice A (nearest house) is incorrect because the text states he had left his house. The text also indicates the options of choices are the most common options that a human would miss. The options are "nearest house, work place, office block, surface of the earth and feet." Also, the text reveals that the humans are missing the office block because they are in space so the options of choices must include choices that would not be available in space such as nearest house. Thus, the missing item is the office block.<n>### Input:Alice and Bob were talking with David one evening. David said, "The first five digits of Alice's phone number are 13." Alice responded, "Correct," then David continued with, "The first five letters of Alice's last name are 'Fat'. Bob asked, "Is Alice fat?" with Alice shouting, "Bob!"<n><n>### Response:"What was Alice's job before becoming a nurse and what did she do for a living before getting her nurse's degree? (She was either an artist, chef or veterinarian.)" The most likely answer is artis because before becoming a nurse she was employed as a chef.<n><n>### Input:"I'm hungry. I'm really hungry. I've been waiting for supper, but it's getting late. My husband just came in with what I've been waiting to eat. It looks like a hamburger. What is that?"<n>### Response:"That is not a hamburger. It is an Italian roast turkey with a green bean casserole, creamed corn, stuffing and fried onions served over mashed potatoes." This is the response because it is the most likely answer that is not a hamburguer because turkeys are not found on hamburgers, Italian roasts are not found on hibburs and the other dishes mentioned in the response are not found on hicuers. So, the answer is something other than a hiburger.<n><n>### Q: A: What was the result of his experiment? B: What had he predicted? C: What did he observe? D: What did he conclude?

Choices:  A: department store B: school C: garden D: office building E: house<n><n>### Response:		<n>The student that made this response will get full credit.<n><n>Input: Sam left his muddy shoves in the entryway.<n>Output: Where could he be.<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>Because the text states, "How might he be?" it is logical that the answers are not specific places, and are locations that begin with the letter B.<n><n>### Reasoning:<n>I had to select 5 or fewer choices. If there were more than 5 choices, I would have had to assume that it wasn't referring to a location, which I can't do.<n><n>### Evidence:<n>The only question I can think of that was not B, was the location that began with D.<n><n>### Tests for Correctness:<n>I checked for correctness by doing a simple search for all the answers and choosing the ones that did not start with the letter B.  There were a handful of mistakes I made, which was my fault for being careless.<n><n>### Further Support:<n>I found an example that helped answer the question:<n>https://www.wikihow.com/Answer-an-SAT-Multiple-Choice-Question<n><n>### Future Improvements:<n>Maybe I should have made all of the choices specific locations, and if it wasn't possible then to include the letter B in the answer.<n><n>### My Thoughts:<n>I think the question is not clear and the instructions are also unclear. The answer I chose was correct the only error was that I did not include the answer with the letter B in it, even though it did not begin with the letter B, in the answer.<n>

Choices:  A: get smart B: boredom C: colds and flu D: taking tests E: spend time<n><n>### Response:		<n>We want to write out a function named goodReason. We think the value of goodReason for A is true. The value of goodReason is true for boredom. The value of goodreason for colds and flu is false, and it would be false for spending time.<n><n>### Input : Can you name a common household spider? Choices: 	A: black widow   B: house spider   C: American house spider   D: phytosaur   E: daddy long legs<n><n>### Response : We want to write out a list of HouseholdSpiders. For the value of common, the HouseholdSpiders should only include one spider in the list. For any other choices, the HouseholdSpider list should contain two spiders.<n><n>### The name of the variable for the HouseholdSpiders would be houseSpiderList<n><n>### What we've done in this task is have several rules of what the output HouseholdSpiders list would hold based on what the choices were. The rules are that if the choice was 'boredom', we want to hold two HouseholdSpiders values that were spiders instead of something else. If we chose 'colds and flu', we want to hold one HouseholdSpider value that is spiders instead of something more common in a household like phytoaseur (dinosaur).<n><n>### If we had a rule that, if we chose 'take tests', we would also hold in the HouseholdSpiders list at least 2 Household Spiders. The choices for testing would be a spider. If we had a rule for testing, it would be that if the choice was taking tests, the rule would be to also hold an item in the HouseholdSpider that isn't a spider but instead 2 more HouseholdSpiders.<n><n>## Instructions:In this code, we want to create variables where the values are based on the choices. We make the rules we want. If we choose 'daddy long legs', we want to hold the value 'legs' inside the Variable Name. If we choose American House Spider, we want to hold the Name 'AHS' inside the Value Variable. Since A and C both list the HouseSpider name, that value would get outputted.<n><n>## Instruction : Write the function goodReasonsOutput.<n><n>##

The answer is true; a human will sit down to reproduce as part of a ritual of being seated on the ground and making love to another human.<n><n>### Input<n><n>Sally is 5 times more powerful than Amy; Amy is 3 times stronger than Bob; and Bob is half as strong as Sally. Which of the following statements is correct?<n><n>A. Sally is 7 times stronger than Bob.<n><n><n>### Response<n><n>This is not right.<n><n>Amy is 3 times stronger and Bob is ½ as strong. Amy is 1.5 times stronger than Bob. There are five times as many Bobs as Amy and Amy and Bob together are 2.5 times as strong as Sally who is 3 times stronger. So Sally is twice as strong as Amy and Amy is 1.3 times stronger than Sally.<n><n>### Note: If you got the logic wrong, please write about how you solved it and what you got wrong.<n><n>### Example response:<n><n>I was a tad off from my calculation above because I got to confused with a "whole" number and "half" number. In the example, if Bob is half stronger than Sally we shouldn't do an integer division by 2 to find out Bob's rating. Bob is in fact, a quarter of Sally's rating and should be rated a 25/0.6 = 41.6 rating. Once you factor 1.3 into Amy's strength, you have your answer.

So, we need to figure out what is left after the boat tipped over.  In this instance, that means we do the following.<n><n>Since we know they initially caught 9 total fish, we can say that after the boat tipped, they lost 3, since it was a quarter of their entire total.  Therefore:<n><n>9 - 3 = 6<n><n>Since we know that initially Jordan had 4 and that now we lose 3, therefore:<n><n>4 - 3 = 1<n><n>And now we know that Jordan has 1 original fish, while Perry has 4.<n><n>So by now, Perry has 4, and Jordan has 1.<n><n>## Make the comparison<n><n>Now, that we calculated the number for Jordan and Perry, we need to make the comparison.<n><n>Comparing Jordan and Perry, we know that we originally had 9, and that now we have 6, so by default, Jordan has lost 3, and Perry still has 4, since they started with 4.<n><n>That is why Perry still has 4 and Jordan only has 1.<n>

Choices:  A: bathroom B: house C: cupboard D: space shuttle E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		 If the smell is stale, it’s reasonable to think that the air is stale. Stale smells can be indicative of the need to clear out garbage. If one were to investigate the source of the smells, one might need a flashlight to check cabinets under the sinks. Garbage can collect in hidden places.  So, the choice to consider is E. If the space shuttle is smelling stale, it’d make more sense to clear the garbage, rather than the other areas where one might have an odor.<n><n>### Input<n><n>Input: A math problem that is 50% of your total score gives you a headache.

A reading problem that scores < 50% should be no more unsettling than someone’s shoelace being tied incorrectly.  The problem with a math problem that is < 50% is that people don’t like to take a half credit; it seems like an insult.<n><n>### Question:<n><n>### Instructioon:<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>### Question Instrucion:<n>### Task

If 10 people eat one cheese, one pepperoni, one onion, one olives, and 1 sausage, and 2/3 are eating pizza, how many sausage is eating pizza?<n>Instruction: Explain to a friend how to create a new variable to store the number of sausage eating pizza.<n>Demonstration: The variable "pizza_eaters" equals 60, divided by four, which equals 15. Since the total number of people eating pizza is 15, we subtract seven since 7 = 1/4 of 29. This leaves 8, which must be one less than 9, so 8 minus 1 equals 7. If that variable is called pizza_eaters, that tells me that 7 people are eating one sausage each, which leaves 2 (8-1). So the second part of the instruction says: create new variable called "sausage_eaters" to store number 2.<n><n>### Answer:<n>Sage is going to be in an art show at the Museum of Modern Art.

I will also be challenged and learn more. I am sure if we were studying in groups and someone has a passing grade, then everyone else will know that it wasn't easy. And then in order to pass, they have done a great job. I won't be punished by my friends at all, we will cheer for one another and feel great because we work together to learn more. I think the hardest part would be if the class struggled with the subject and no one had a decent grade, no one would want to talk about it.

Choices:  A: bad feelings B: confusion C: going to court D: hurt feelings E: sandwiches<n><n>### Response:		"Instituting civil action" is a phrase which refers to putting in motion the legal process which allows people to settle disputes with each other without resorting to violence. It is also referred to as "litigation," which means to seek relief from a legal dispute in the courts of law. It usually consists of a written complaint and a formal summons. The action may entail attorney's fees and will most likely result in bad feelings between the plaintiff and the defendant. It can also be settled outside of court if both parties agree to the results of mediation or arbitration.<n><n>### Input:"Eat that candy, dear! It is good for you." "But mother, I can't like it." "Why not, sweetheart?" "Because of its appearance." "Is not appearance something that can be changed?" "Certainly." "Well, then why can't you like candy?<n><n>### Response:"That candy looks bad." This is a strange response. Certainly there are many things in life that are of an unattractive appearance. The difference is that in many cases the appearance of these "unattractive things" has the result of us liking them. We tend to feel that way about people who are of an unattended or unpolished appearance. The reverse is also true. People often take kindly to persons who appear to be well-dressed, well-groomed and prosperous. We also tend to like people who smile and use "please" and "thank you."<n><n># Task:<n><n># Task:Write 50 words that explain and relate to one of the following sets of words:<n><n>### Task:Airline or airplane<n><n>### Task:"But it was an AIRplane.

The quote in parentheses is a very brief explanation as to how the plane is an airplane. To understand the context of why the airplane is in its location within the song, it is perhaps wise to know a bit about the song. When "Jet Airliner" was first released in 1971,

How many fish remain?<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:What do all rooms facing outside have? Choices:  A: square shape B: different sizes C: flowers D: doors and windows E: high walls<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Input: <n><n>## Step 0: Prepare<n><n>For every question, you will need one or more programs.  <n>A program is a collection of zero or more statements.     <n>See the syntax guide for examples. <n><n>## Step2: Read the question<n><n>There is a program (or programs) for each input.  The program reads the input, then executes the actions it is designed to take.  <n><n>## Step3: Think<n><n>Review the question, then think about what the program might need to do.  Remember, you can use any variable and constant types allowed (but see the list). <n><n>## Step4: Write<n><n>Now you will type your program using the syntax that you have learned from the syntax guide.  <n>Once you have a draft, test it.  <n><n>### Important Notes<n><n>See syntax guide for more details about the following 5 tips/rules<n><n>- If a program takes no, or multiple inputs, it ends with the "end" statement.  <n>- if the program is designed to run more than once, (i.e., a loop), begin with an "input/input-repeat-end" statement.   See the example in the syntax guide to see what this means.<n>- Some questions will have multiple statements.   For example, if a program asks, "what day of the week is next week?"  the answer can be expressed in two statements <n>  - first statement: `next-week: = input[weekday]+1`<n>  - second statement: if `next-month>next-week`, `next-year = (next-month>next_week)`<n>  - In this example next-week is the variable name, next_week is another name for the same variable, and weekday is the list of possible values<n>- In a single statement, the statements can be separated by a semicolon or more often are separated by a space (but the following one won't have a space)<n>- The first line of a program (the line that is first in the text editing window) is called the header.  If a header does not exist, a question will not be graded.  <n><n>

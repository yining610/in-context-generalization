How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Answer: 5<n><n>### Input:When I was home, I was comfortable.  But I had a crippling fear of going where? Choices:  A: outside B: vacation C: idle D: apartment E: neighborhood<n><n>### Response:		<n>Inside Idle<n><n>**Explanation**: "where inside I was comfortable" (the "I" is a subject here, rather than the "was", which is a descriptive that goes with the pronoun). The noun that the pronoun "I" goes with is usually the noun in the second part of the sentence in each case.<n><n>### Input<n>1. I was comfortable where I home.  But I had<n><n>### Response<n>Outside I was comfortable.<n><n>**Explanance**: The answer is "outside", and here's why: "home" is a noun, so the pronoun has to be "I". "was comfortable where" indicates the clause in the sentence is a relative clause containing "home", which is the noun being modified by "where". "but I had" is a main clause modifying "I was comfortable" and containing the subclause of "where I home". This is what the pronoun modifies: "where I home" (note that where goes with the sentence, not where I home). The noun "where I home" is the subject of a transitive verb, so it needs a direct object. That object is the entire clause "was comfortable where I home." "was comfortable" is also a prepositional phrase, so "I" goes with "was." "Idle" would be incorrect, because the question doesn't contain an "e" in "Idle", and because "home" is singular, and so "where" would end with an "s". <n><n>Comment: I know this is a duplicate, but a lot of users are confused as to why there are two examples. If you really think there should be one, then you need to edit the second example, and add two sentences to the first.<n><n>Comment: @JayZawaski: What if I want to show two examples, one with a multiple choice question and one without?<n><n>Comment: It doesn't work that way.

Choices:  A: health club B: jocks C: fitness centre D: stadium E: gymnasium<n><n>### Response:		The choices you have here are health club, stadium, and jocks<n><n>### Rationale:<n>You can answer these questions using one of four strategies:<n><n>1. **Subset Test**: Consider the choices in this exercise. Which pairs of choices are subsets (not members) of the same list? (Think: If some choices on this list are subsets of other choices, then we can't have any choices that are subsets of every choice.)<n>2. **Premise Test**: Consider the list of pairwise choices here. Can you find a premise that proves or disproves one of these pairs of choices is a subset (not a member) of the list? ("If A is a subset of B, then A has a subset that is a member of B.")<n>3. **Counterargument**: If you think that one choice is a subset of another choice, or the other way around, can you create a counterargument where you prove that each of these choices is _not_ a subset (not a memeber) of the other choice? (If we cannot create a counterargument, our answer is incorrect!)<n>4. **Contradictions**: If choice A is a member of choice B, can you create one contradiction for each of the choices in this list such that B _does not_ contain any of these contradiction? (If we cannot find any contradictions, our answer is incorrect)

I had to cross the state line and drive on very foggy and icy road. Just after crossing the state line, my car skidded off the the road and got stuck in the ditch. To make it worse I lost control of the wheel and went straight into a tree, and the car came to a stop in the cold, snowy field behind me. I started to feel very scared. Suddenly, I heard a knock on the side window. I looked and saw a guy who looked to be in his twenties. He said hello, as he reached in and turned the ignition. As the engine started and began to run, the man said, "I'll take care of this for you, I'm a mechanic." He backed out of the car and I drove away. I never got his name, just looked at the sign on his van door and read "Mechanic for Hire" and drove away shivering and extremely grateful. I never stopped to look back at where he was headed. Just happy I made it safely to the hospital. I told my doctor what happened that weekend, and to my surprise he told me that the mechanic that fixed my car was also on his way to the hospital. His wife was in labour and he was driving her there too. The mechanic ended up in a terrible car crash on the way there and his wife passed away. When I told him I knew his story, he said, "I'm glad you were there on my car when I needed it." But, I thought about what the mechanic had saved me when I needed it too.<n><n><n>  <n>  <n><n>### Response<n>Input: A<n>

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes.

How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Answer: 5<n><n>### Input:How can one's views change after learning about science? Choices:  A: appreciation of nature B: become educated C: excitement D: increased knowledge E: see things differently<n><n>### Response:		<n>In my opinion, views can change a lot in science or otherwise. I can say this because by learning about different things in my life or science, I have changed my opinions on many of them. For example, I used to not believe that there was life in outer space but after learning about the possibilities that there is life in other planets, it changed my views on that subject. Or if I were to use the example of going through a science project, if you did not understand one concept at first and then you were able to learn about it and explain it, that would change your views on the concept. <n><n>### Difficulty:<n>This question is not that difficult because you can easily relate to an answer about how your opinion changed in science, so its not that hard to answer.<n><n>### Question 1:Choose 2 toxins - aluminium sulphate and calcium hydroxide for the following instructions:<n><n>### Instructions:What should you add to the mixture? Choice: A: water B: a metal C: a spoon D: a stirrer E: boiling water<n><n>### Instructio: <n>Aluminium sulphate is an aqueous solution meaning it is a solvent in water that can do the job by breaking apart the solute and solvent in the solution. Calcium hydroxide is a dry substance so it will not work without being dissolved so it is necessary to dissolve it in water first. This would be the correct answer because adding water to both ingredients would solve the problem.<n><n>### Solution:<n>Adding water and dissolving it will break down the ingredients in to the solute and solute. Which will then cause the solution to be effective in lowering the pH of the mixture.<n><n>### Dificulty<n><n>The answer is simple, just add in water. Adding water to an ingredient will always dissolve it and make the ingredient more effective and it is also good for any pH reactions. It is not a hard question because it just adds water to the ingredient.<n><n>### Choice 2:<n><n>### <n>Input:  If 68 is added to 23, the answer is close to 1. What is the answer?

Choices:  A: cupboard B: countertop C: water D: hardware department E: england<n><n>### Response:		How many candies does corey have?<n><n>Tapanga and Corey don't have any candies or the same number of candies? Tapanga would've answered this question using the word "together". That is, instead of saying Corey had 66 candies, Corey had 35. There are two different ways to word this, but Tapanga is the one who worded it the way she meant. However I believe that this is not a math skill, because she could have worded it differently and said Corey had 69. Because you are solving it using math you still have to answer it as if they had the same number of candys, because we are still doing math.<n><n>### Input:"Freddy is calling his family to say New Year's Eves. He calls his daddy, who lives in the city as him and they talk for 50 minutes.  Then he calls his brother who lives on the other part of the world and they talk for 15 minutes. Local Calls cost 5 cents per minute, while international calls costs 25 cents per minute. How many dollars does Freddy spend calling his Family on New Year's eve?"<n><n>The solution to this question would be $10, because you are going to use the dollars for calls. You would have to say that his family called Freddy 38 minutes because Freddy would have the international calls for the 15minutes and he would also have local calls to his brother for the other 23 minutes. Meaning that these total up to 38 minutes in his phone calls combined. Also, to figure out which number of minutes he would spend talking to his family you would have to use the fraction of how long the local calls are versus how long international calls are. You would say his international calls took 15/31st minute so this makes $10<n><n>### Input" Where do you keep a coconut? Choices: A: Countertop B: Cupboard"<n>This question is tricky so I think it is a math question. Even though the answer would not be a coconut. It is a type of math test that needs word answer. So the answer would be that you would keep a coconut in a cabinet or closet  but this is not why anyone would call this a math equation. Even though there

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Answer: 5<n><n>### Input:The jar was plastic, just like most of the stuff in the kitchen.  John preferred glass, and wished he was somewhere else.  Where does he want to be? Choices:  A: cupboard B: anywhere else C: everything D: own home E: garbage dump<n><n>### Response:		You should not use more than 150 words, be sure to support your answer.<n><n>#### A)<n><n>My response would be choice A where John wants to be in a different cabinet. That is, one that is not plastic. If he wants to be anywhere else it would not be logical since he was stating that he was “in the garbage dump.” He could have wished to be the same place it he did not want to change. So it makes no sense to respond with C, D, or E because, he said he preferred glass. Also, <n>that would not sound logical if he was referring to the cupboard or anything else.<n><n>He wants to be in the kitchen, even if the jar was different he still preferred the kitchen, not the cupboard. Therefore, it is very logical that he chose option A. If he was only given a choice of two, it would be between C and D. Even if he said that it was preferable to be in a different cupboard,  it does not mean that he wants to be in a completely different cabinet or area. However, because he disliked the plastic jar, he stated that he wished he could be some place else. But that does not make sense because, of course when he first started talking about the jar he was in the kitchen. If he was not, he would have stated he was not in the kitchen.<n><n>The only option left for him is the kitchen; then later he says he wants to be somewhere else. I think he probably could have been in the dining room or just outside of the house in the garden. One option would be out on the porch, or maybe even outside in the backyard. That might not be the best option, but this is just my opinion. Any other option other than the kitchen or outside of the kitchen would not make any sense. That would be too far from the cupboard. If I were to reply to this question, I would definitely agree with A since only the kitchen is an option for him. If he is outside this statement does not make any sense, for example: “I like the jar.  It is my favorite color.  I would rather be in the cabinet.” Then I would not be able to respond with A since that would not be a question. So that statement would go under the category, “anything else.”<n><n>#### B)<n><n>I think the answer  would be B because John could

Choices:  A: build family together B: fall in love C: make love D: complete E: distance themselves<n><n>### Response:		<n>In this data set, we will be examining a set of pairs of numbers that describe how much a pair or partners enjoys intimacy, and how much they avoid intimacy.<n>There are a few variables in the dataset that are labeled A, B, C, and D. A is a number between 1 and 5 that describes how much the pair enjoys intimacy; B is a number between 0 and 4 that describes how much the partner avoids intimacy. There is one final variable that has a range of values, not limited like the intimacy variables are limited at. For example, A might be a value between 1 and 2 if the pair has a high intimacy score, whereas if they had a low intimacy score, A might be a number under 1. It should be interesting to see how the data varies for different pairings as they fall in love, whether they decide to stay together or whether they split up, and even after the pair splits up!<n>##<n>### Input:How long will it take to get 1,000 answers from a survey?

In return, I will get new freedom, good heart, new relationship, and good karma. I think that forgiving others is the most challenging thing to do, but it is the only way to be free. If someone wronged me, I could feel betrayed and I could feel anger about such kind of things. Instead, I should choose to forgive that person because I could see him in a different way. Now, forgiving people is easy for me because I want to see a new life with new relationship and new heart. I love forgiving other people because it makes me feel good spirit, even though I have to accept what I can't do. I want to have a good relationship with a person who made me feel bad or angry. Forgiving could give me a new perspective of how I feel. In addition, forgiving others also helps me to set my mind for a new world of hope and freedom. I think that forgiveness will help other people to get good relationship with others. <n>

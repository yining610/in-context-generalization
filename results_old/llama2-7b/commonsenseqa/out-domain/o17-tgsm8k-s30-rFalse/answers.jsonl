The term \u201ccoach\u201d is not an appropriate response; the noun being modified is \u201crefrigerator\u201d (which \u201crefrigerator was used in the question). Thus the correct answer is the carpet. The term \u201ccarpet\u201d would normally be used to describe the carpet of a room or other such surface.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n1. The question contains both a picture and a description of the picture. The first sentence is: He found it covered in mould in the back of his refrigerator.\n2. To find out how many birds are counted, we must first find out how many birds were counted in total. We already know (given in the question) that Janet counted 30 crows and 60% mroe than crows. That leaves us with the question of finding out the total number of crows. We will do this by taking Janet\u2019s statement \u201c60% more than the crows\u201d as a percentage of the crows, 60% of the crows = 30% of the hawks. 60% of 30 is 18 (we have to multiply 30 by 1/60.) This means that there were at least 48 hawks. 48 + 30 = 78, which is the total number of birds Janet counted.", "answer": "B: refrigerator"}

Input: In this situation, you would use:\n\n## Solution:\n1. [4] \u00d7 $470 = $1,880\n\n2. The first two examples show the use of subscripts. After you apply the first subscript, the next operation uses the first subscript, but it is called with a lowercase letter (i). Thus, there is no change in letters. The third example shows how to apply a subscript for the third time, with a completely different letter (y).\n\n3. A=72 m\u00b3 B = 108 m\u00b3 The result in this case is $1,200.

This method is a type of optimization problem. The problem is a function of the variables (corn, potatoes, pork, chicken, etc.) that the optimization problem can select to minimize a cost function. (Cost minimization is often the goal in mathematical programming).\n\nThe process of solving the optimization problem is to find the optimal value (minimum value) of the cost function, given the constraints of the problem.\n\n### Question:Can someone point to research studies of how linear models can be improved?\n\nAnswer: Some linear programming is based on the use of the simplex method for solving the linear program. The simplex method is heuristic, meaning there is a \"best\", or \"optimal\", way to solve an optimization problem. The \"optimal\" solution will minimize a cost function subject to the constraints of the problem, however, there is no guarantee that the \"optimal\" solution is an actual solution to the problem.\n\nFor example, suppose the problem is to maximize the difference between the average height of 10 children in each of two classes and the average height of all the children in the school. There are 50 children in the school. The average height of the 50 children is 80 inches. There are 10 children in first grade and 10 children in the 2nd grade. Each of the 10 children in 1st grade is 6 inches shorter than the average height of all children (75 inches), and each of the 10 second graders is 13 inches shorter than the average 80 inch height (67 in).\n\nThe constraints is that each of the 1st grade students must have a height that is at least", "answer": "D: economic instability"}

Then it is about the question on how did the price increase\n\n### Exploratory Process\n- Whenever I get a question, I find a place where I can get something from to use in solving it. Usually, it's from the internet. When I don't know what something is, i'd rather use my phone to get the answer and then use it on my paper\n\n### Expert Process\n- Whenever the question is very tough and I couldn't figure out for even 30 seconds, I use my phone to look at the answer. But I change the answers to the words that the question asks for.\n\n### My Question:What could be a better process for solving tough questions?\n\n### My Answer:I should follow the answer through my whole time in the Expert process.

Choices: 1:37 miles/hr 3:95 miles/hr A: B: C: D: E: \n\n### Response :3:95 miles per hour, and 3:95 mph, respectively. The trains go at about the same rate for each mile. They each go 682 miles at 3:95mph for a total of 8674miles which is 12 hours. So for each hour they travel half the total distance. This would mean that each of them go at different rates.\n\n### Question:  One evening when it was raining, Billy told his mom: You have $200 more than I do. If I have 5 times as many dollars as my sister does, how many dollars, in total, does Billy have?\n\n### Response\n\nBilly has $200 and 5 times as much as his sister but how do they both equal $200? They can not so he does not have that much but he has as much as his sister does.\n\n### Example :Two trains are traveling together. One of them, a passenger train, is twice as fast as the other train.  The faster train leaves on time but the passenger train is late.  If the passenger train leaves an hour after the faster one, when will the passenger train arrive?\n\n### Answer :\nThe faster train leaves at 3:44 pm, and therefore reaches destination at 1:04pm by their arrival the passenger train is still going to be 1 hour after they left. This would mean the faster train would get there 3 hours earlier than the passenger train. This means they arrived at 10 am.\n\n### How many, in miles, is 186 miles north of 41?\n\n### Instructions:Use the information to answer the question. \n\n### Solution: (186-41)", "answer": "C: medicine"}

For example, your Aunt Myriam might like your photo, but not leave a comment. Or your friend Maddox might comment, like, and reshare the image onto his own Instagram story. Or maybe the entire world likes and shares that image, and your influencer status flourishes.\n\nIn this project, your job is to create an algorithm that can predict a sequence of user actions (like, comment, share, etc.) given an image on Instagram. Of course if it's a dog, you shouldn't call it an \"image\" ;)\n\nThis project can be done in any of these languages: Python, Ruby, HTML, CSS, C#, or Javascript. If you'd like to learn a programming language before taking this project, check out [this](how-to-learn-to-program) out!\n\n1. Get a computer and a blank Python 3 shell or an online Python shell.\n2. Use a text editor to download or write this project, and make sure you're ready to go!\n\n### Instructions\n\nWe've written three short Python 3 scripts. The first script shows examples of how to write an Instagram action to a file. The second script reads from a file of actions and predicts one of the possible actions for a given image. Finally, the third script predicts five of the possible actions for seven randomly chosen images.\n\nYou can download the Python 3 scripts below!\n\n  ```{dropdown} Download Downloads Python 3 downloads\n  Download a project folder (zip) Download (zip)\n  Download an HTML template Download (html)\n  Download an illustration Download (png)\n  Download a video", "answer": "E: freeway"}

{"text": "E\n\n### Discussion:\nTo complete this question, you must know the correct answer to the question.  The correct answer is E.  If you need me to explain, it might help to first solve this using the following formula:\n\n$% = \\frac{100 + Amount Paid}{original price - amount paid} * $% = ($.00 + 150.00 - 150.45) * %$\n\nThen multiply by the percent and you will get the answer.\n\nWe have 100.00 of dollars which is $.1 of dollars (100 is 100/100 = 1. If it is 10.00, it will be $.1).  We have 150.35 which is $-7.3 of dollars (150 is 150/150 = 1).  We have $503.0 which is $503/1000 = 50.3%.  Then we multiply all of this.  You can take it from there. \n\n### Input : A family has 2 teenage children. The husband and wife each have 2 children under the age of 30. How many children are there in the family? Answer: 2\n\n### Response : D\n\n### Discusion:\nTo answer this question, you must calculate how many siblings each child of the family might have.  If they are brothers or sisters, divide by 2 and you will get the number.  If they are children of other children, divide by 2, because half were children of their parents and half were childrens of their siblings.\n\nIf siblings are the same sex, you don't subtract from the siblings.\n\n### Input :- 1 = 1% of 520$ how much is the cost of the product?\n\n### Response :- 520\n\n### Discision:-\nI found this by adding some values like 2 = 2% of 1000$ so if 1 = 1000% of what ever amount then 1000 is 50 times more than 100 so divide 50 with whatever amount of product that is cost", "answer": "C: drugstore"}

Last week the office manager calculated that each office stair climb used eight watts-hours of power. The salesman\u2019s wife takes the stairs up each day because she prefers to exercise on the stairs. The salesman takes the elevator up most days, but he takes the stairs some days when he has a lot of paperwork and wants to save time. The salesman takes both the elevator and the stairs, alternating between them, on some days. Last week, the elevator climb used 12 kilowatts-hours. The office manager, the salesman, and the secretary\u2019s wife take the elevator and stairs together back down two days each week.\n\n#### Demonstration: \n\nThe elevator cost $400 to install, and it uses 500 kilowatt-hours of energy per workweek. The office stair climbing rack cost $10,000 to build, uses 200 kilowatts of energy per workweek, costing $2 per hour to operate.\n\n**Input:**\n\n* Elevator cost\n* Elevator daily kWh usage\n* Stairs cost\n* Stairs weekly wHours usage\n\n**Output:**\n\nElevator should be used more often because it is cheaper compared to the stairs.

If he wants to use something to level it, he can use a book, piece of wood, or water.\n\n### Question: How does the student determine which of the choices is best?\n\n### Answer: This option is best as it provides an equally solid, level surface that may already be at hand.

He\u2019s a chef at a local restaurant and is hoping to share recipes and cooking advice with other residents. Based on the following information, what is the best room for him and his daughter to live in?\n\n### Answer: The top floor would be a good room for him to live in for cooking but the top floor also has the 4th and 5th story as well. The 11th floor would be a good floor also but it's right next to the roof, which would be a bad place to live because roofs are really noisy, windy, really hard to get to. So he will have problems getting away from loud noises and also get away from the wind. The 3rd floor is too close to the bottom floor for a lot if problems with the stairs and such. The second floor isn't a good position for him because of the noise made from his neighbors on the first floor because it's such a low level that makes it easy for them to make noise on the first floor.\n\n### Analysis:\nThis is a multi-question task that asks for your opinion on a choice of activities that you could do to cope with loneliness. You are provided information about the activities which have pros and cons. You have to determine which one will be optimal for the individual. The individual is lonely by definition (loneliness, from Latin word Lona, means being apart from society), so he might not even consider having friends or family nearby, so he might want to meet other people. If he really needs help though, he might choose socialize or liquor. Other pros and cons could be mentioned as well such as not talking to people at all, which would help him feel less loneliness and make his life boring. In the case if he doesn\u2019t want to meet people around him, liquor would be the best choice (it\u2019s also a bad choice) because he could drown his loneliness.\n\n### Conclusion\nMy response was to not meet people, drink alcohol, and socialize. In any situation like this I would always say that someone should not meet new people unless it is 100% necessary and they are alone and have no way to go back to where they are from", "answer": "D: socialize"}

How long will it take Sheree to get a new passport, if you subtract from the time it takes to get a new driver\u2019s license each the time it takes to renew a driver\u2019s license.\n* Answer:\n`A: A new passport requires you to schedule an appointment.`\n\n#### Explanation 1:\n`A: New Passport`\n`Requires: Scheduling an appointment`\n\n#### Instruction:Answer the question.\n* Answer:There are two answers. The first is to look at how long it takes to get a license on the driver\u2019s license application you are using for the current information about what is needed. If it contains information about getting a passport it will contain much more because it requires more information.\n\n#### Explanations:\nThere are two separate information sheets that will need to be filled out for the purposes of getting these two licenses.  First, it is important to realize that both require a different type of ID, so they may have different requirements.  It is important to think about how long it takes to do this because each state has different requirements and can take a lot of time.\n\nIt is important to understand how long it takes for each, because passports are more difficult than driver\u2019s licenses to get.   There are many more things that are required and in some cases, extra steps.  For instance, driver\u2019s licenses only require the submission of some paperwork that you can do in a day.  But passports require that you submit all of it, and you have to wait several days to submit it to the embassy.  It means that even though it doesn\u2019t take longer to fill out the paperwork,", "answer": "C: bible"}

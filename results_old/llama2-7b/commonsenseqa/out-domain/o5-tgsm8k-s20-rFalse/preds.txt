Choices:  A: own house B: better job C: win lottery D: save money E: feel safe<n><n>### Response:		In order to make more at a certain job, one may often need to find a way to own a house.  By owning a house, one will be able to save money instead of spending it on rent.  The amount of money saved up is able to be spent in a different way.  There are other ways to make more money, but they will not be able to last forever.  The person who wants to make money at their job may be able to make a lot of money by winning a lottery.  This way will only work on rare occasions.  A person will not be able to rely on their lottery prize as a permanent way to make more money at their job.  They may need another way to make money, and the money will probably run out after a while.  A person can feel safe and less stressed at work with a better job, but this will not necessarily result in a raise or an increase of their pay.  For that, one can earn more money by finding ways to save money.  For example, saving money over time will allow someone to purchase things, such as a house, which will lead to making money.  Also, saving money will result in being able to have more room to spend on things which may make them feel more secure in certain circumstances.<n><n>### Input :Choose the appropriate letter.

The median income was $305 more than the mean income.<n>Question: What is the income of a typical American in this population?<n>Answer: $28,182<n>Input: According to 1987 data, about 10% of all 10 year olds in the United States could not solve a simple math problem of 1 + 1. However, 75% of children who cannot solve simple multiplication problems at age 10 will have trouble with mathematics in adulthood.<n>Question: How many 10-year-olds in the United States could solve simple multiplication problems?<n>Answer: 7,000<n><n>### Instuction:<n>Explain why your answer is correct.<n><n>### Response :<n>Input; The United States population in 1991 was 330 million. Let's start from there. We're going to round everything off to be one or two decimal places and then get a dollar amount from that. First, the mean income will be $29,798. Next, the mode income will be $27,000. Finally, the median income is $28,141. Now round out 28,140 to two decimal places and get 28.14, so to get a dollar amount, multiply the rounded number of two decimal places by 100, which will give you an answer of $2,814. Add all 3 numbers together and get 29,992. Which is almost $22,000 above the median income. Because they say median is 305 more than mean, (305+100=$405) add the 405 to $29,771 and get $30,176. But since mean and modal income rounds $2

Instruction:This task asks us to solve simple arithmetics, so we need to first understand that we need to write our answer in the range of 60000 to 100000. 2. Demonstration:We can use the number 1000 to do our calculations. We know that 4 hours of work will give us 40. So we can use 40hours equal to 44 minutes. 3. Solution:The question asks us to calculate the number of minutes 600. We know that 600hours are the same as 600*24 hours/60=60000 minutes. But 720 minutes equal to 1 hour, so we conclude that 600 minutes equals 600*30=18000 minutes. 4. Instruction:This question asks us to write a complete sentence, so we can write the answer "Michael makes birdhouses to make money at craft shows. He makes birdhouses out of wood/plastic." 5. Response:D: Because we know that feeling angry or making tea are things to do after someone has been insulted or said bad things to you. 6. Instruction: This task asks us to create a list. 7.

Choices:  A: auditorium B: office C: synagogue D: confession E: church<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>>**[C]](https://github.com/vhf/learn-git-and-golang/issues/125)"confession". That place is for listening or telling something that you don't want other people to know. But that can be in the church.**<n><n>### Instructor feedback<n>>Yeah, it's a lot nicer place to write a confession instead of writing a note in a bathroom stall at your workplace because there are too many people walking in and out the bathroom. The only place that is more likely for us to write down is at our home or somewhere secluded. But that doesn't say much about the other place. I don't know if the other place is good for confessing or not.<n><n>### Discussion:<n>I think that [E] is the right one. <n><n>1. The question is talking about religious speech, which means there are a lot of people gathered to listen to the speech. <n>2. The question also asked "where", which means it is talking about a place (an environment), not something that happens (like things that we do). <n>3. The question also asks "people sitting", which means the place is sitting, not standing. Because sitting is more comfortable than standing.<n>4. I think when a priest or a believer wants to confess to god, they would normally go to a church. Therefore the answer is the church.

Choices:  A: the sun B: catch cold C: prepare to go D: feel humiliated E: hunt for food<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>The question that was set was: "The person knew the police are chasing him, so what did they do?" And the answer should have included "catch cold" and "hunt for food". This is because he was very cold from all the chasing by the police and when the police went to go after him, this person had to go out and hunt for food. And that is why he did so.<n><n>### Input-:Rick got 52% of the votes and John got 20% of the votes. How did the ratio of Rick votes compared to John's votes?<n><n>### Response-:2 to 3<n><n>This question involved an input of percentage and this percentage was taken from two people, hence the input was taken as ratio and not as whole number.<n><n>This means the answer to the question was 2 : 3. This means that Ratio of first person votes to second person votes was 2:3.<n><n>Rick got 50 % of the votes and John did not get 40 % of the votes, but 20 % of the votes. This means that if total votes was 100, Ratio of Rick votes to John votes will be 50/20 = 2.50 = 2/3.<n><n>### Response:-<n><n>This question involved a sub-traction and an input. The subtraction was, "Input: One of the candies cost $1.25 and the other candies cost $0.48.How much does the candy cost altogether?".<n><n>The question is wrongly set, as the question asks for how much candy does the cost altogether? The solution gives the sum to be $0.73<n><n>## References<n>1.http://www.mathsisfun.com/money-money.html  <n>2.https://byjus.com/maths/addition/add-5-and-4/

He charges $22 for each large birdhouse, $16 for each medium birdhouse, and $7 for each small birdhouse. This week, he sold 2 large birdhouses, 2 medium birdhouses, and 3 small birdhouses. How much money, in dollars, did he make this week?<n>Answer: 97<n><n>### Input:Sean was lying about the body, but he was very scared.  He constantly worried about what? Choices:  A: the reward money B: hurt feelings C: being found out D: problems E: trouble<n><n>### Response:		The correct response is "The reward money".<n><n>#### Rationale<n><n>If the question were about hurt feelings, problems or trouble then Sean would not have been lying. The question is asking about Sean's scaredness.<n><n>If the question was about Sean's worries about being found out, then the option that matches it would be "B", since being found out would require people to know that Sean was lying (and that he was lying to protect the body).<n><n>If the question is about Sean's worry about being scolded, then the options that match it are "The reward money" and "The problems", since being scolded is not the same as being found out. But either choice would also be correct, since being scolded for the act of lying would mean that Sean was found out and therefore that he was worried about being found out.<n>

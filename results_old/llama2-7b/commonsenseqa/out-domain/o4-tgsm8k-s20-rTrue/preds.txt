You should choose:<n><n>- If a metal pole tripped him, and he works in a factory, it means that he worked in a factory, while building that pole. Thus, according to question, he should choose 'factory'.<n><n>- If he was in an engine and tripped over a metal poll, he is in engine. Thus, he should choose 'engine'.<n><n>- If A is true, then B is also true. If A is false, C is also true. So, it comes down to the question of finding true or false, we should choose 'Factory'.<n><n>| | | | | | | A | B | C | D | E | |<n>|--|------|------|------|  |  |  |  ||<n>|true|true  |false  |true  |  |  &lt;----- A and B are false, E is false<n><n>Due to the fact in A, A is false, B and C, we cannot say truth, that means, A & B & C & E are false.<n><n>### Output: If it starts to hail and freeze in a city, what happens to the streets?

The queen moves one square forward, one square sideways, or to the square diagonally across from its current square. The king moves one square forward, but not to the square diagonal from its current square nor forward over a friend (one of Tapanga's pieces) and the pawns can only move forward, as long as they are not in the starting position. If a piece is removed from the board, it cannot be played again. Each side begins the game with a rook, two knights, two bishops, and two kings and a queen. Tapanga plays on the right side of the board, while Corey plays on the left side. There is no starting position, which means that Corey starts with a queen. Tapaga plays first. To the right of Tapanga is a black square. Choose Tapaga’s move. Then, choose Corey’s move.<n><n><n>Input: Choose Tapaga's move<n><n>  a: Move one square clockwise: The rook moves one square forward.<n>  b: Move one square counter-clockwise: The rook cannot move one square counter-clockwards.<n>  c: Move two squares forward: The bishop can move one square forward and one square diagonal, so it can move two squares forward.<n>  d: The King moves one square forward: The king can travel to a square next to its first square if the square is not occupied, e.g. the second square.<n>  e: The Queen moves, two squares next to the first: The queen moves one square sideways or diagonal. The Queen cannot move to the square diagonal from the first square. <n>  f: Move the rook one square forward: The knight can move one square forward or diagonal.<n><n>Input: Tapaga’s turn is over, please choose Corey’s next move<n><n>  a-d: These answer choices do not matter because the game has a turn per person. <n>  e-f: The King cannot move because the king can only move

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute.

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve.

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

In the case of these questions, the meaning of these words is clear, but in some cases their meanings are not well defined.  It is the purpose of this instruction to provide an example of the type of question these words tend to answer.  Answers should be given in multiple choice format.<n><n>### Rationales:The word "south" indicates to the student that the word "south" is related to geography, which would be another way, of saying location.  The word "flight" is probably referring to the place where someone is located and might not be referring to air travel.  The word "Mexico" is likely referring to a place rather than a person or an object.<n><n>### Sample answers:<n>The cabinets were imported > from the south.John bought they > because he knew that > they would look good.Where might they be installed?

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve.

We can love again, but the first love, that remains in our heart is still there as it has not come to any end.<n><n><br />A: This is incorrect as there are a lot of things that can be "contagious", this is not limited to love.<n><n>B: This is not valid as to be "wrong" something has to be wrong.<n><br />C: "Last forever" is a good sentence to describe love.<n><n>D:  Love is not "painful". It can hurt at times, but it is not painful.<n><br />E: This is not valid because we can not see what "blind" is and love is defined only by the people who feel it. Therefore, we can not blindly say that it "lasts forever".<n>

What is one of the many things he has to watch them doing? Choices:  A: bathe B: bite C: die of cancer D: obesity E: copulate<n><n>### Response:		<n>The most likely reason is that John studies animals' biology and behavior to learn more about bats, which tend to sleep upside down on ceilings and occasionally wake up in trees by hanging upside down like bats. This is why John is so interested in studying animal biodiversity.<n><n>### Input John needs a bicycle for his daily commute and it is too small for him to ride.What is the most likely problem with his bike? Choices: 1:It has no brakes 2:The wheel is faulty 3:It is too short 4:It has no gears<n><n>### Response<n><n>The problem is that it is too wide for John to ride. If John can't fit on his bike, the solution would be to remove the gears altogether (either by using backpedalers to help keep the wheels from turning or by making fewer gears). If John can't pedal, he won't steer well and will be less stable in the pedal position, which could cause him to fall off his bike at a high speed. If John wants to ride his bicycle faster, he should consider wearing clothing that is more aerodynamic.<n><n><n>### Input 5. The problem is that there are not enough gears on the front wheel to allow for more turning at lower speeds. This could mean that John needs to be able to turn faster to avoid falling off his bike at higher speeds (or that he needs to know how to turn at much lower speeds). If John does not know how to turn his bike at low speeds, he will have difficulty steering.<n>### Answer<n><n>#### 4:It has few gears, so it is not possible to increase the speed at which he pedals<n><n>### Input A 6 kg block on a horizontal surface is attached to a rope. At the end of the rope is a bucket that weighs 1 kg. The block is pulled upward, and at what point does the block suddenly stop moving? (A) The block will stop when it is stopped at the end of the roop. (B) The block stops while the rope is being pulled up on one side and down on another side.

You can't rely on the question to give you a better idea of what the correct response would be. Here you have the sentence, "Soap water was used instead of the chlorine at the pool." And it is your job to find out what the author was thinking. It is your job to figure out what the author meant.<n><n>If you had any doubt about the methodology, well you don't. You had to have read something about this.<n><n>There are only 5 possible answers. Since the sentence begins with "So", we can immediately eliminate the B, C, D and E choices. B = So she didn't want to smell perfume C = But she didn't like to swim D = So she wasn't fond of swamps E = So the puddle was disgusting So the answer is A, perfume.<n><n>A good strategy is to eliminate two answers and then pick the answer that is left.

Choices:  A: street B: binder C: obesity D: living room E: office suite<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Rationales:  Let's consider the number "223." We notice that it has a 2 in the tens place, and a 2 in the ones place, so it is 22. Let's see if it is less than 223. It is not, so it is larger than 223; so 223 is smaller than this number.<n>Also let's look at the number 2203. It has a 2 in both the tens place and the ones place, so 223 and 223 are the same size. Also, the numbers after 2203 decrease by 1, so 2203 is greater than this number.<n><n>### Output:<n>```<n>The numbers are: {223: 8.6908E-10, 223: 1.0558E-10}<n>```<n><n>### Rationale: We need to know when numbers are smaller than 223 (the first number in the list) and when they are larger than 2203 (the second number in the list). We will use the `is_less()` (and `is_greater()`) function from the `comparison` library to check whether a number is smaller than 220 or greater than 223 when `smaller_num` (a number we wish to compare) is smaller than 20 (220/102). The code looks like this:<n>```python<n>def is_smaller_than_num(smaller_num, num):<n>	if smaller_num >= num:<n>		return True;<n>	else:<n>		return False;<n>```<n><n>A simplified version:<n>```python<n>if not is_smaller_then_num(220,3):<n>	print("Number is less than 2003");<n>elif not is_smallerthen_num(200,3):<n>    print("Number is less than or equal to 2003.");<n>else:<n>    print("Number less than 203.");<n>```<n><n>Also notice that only the 0, 1, or 2 in a number's tens digit (the rightmost digit) can be greater than

Its Condition<n><n>To begin with, the condition of a house is a very important determining factor, as it impacts several aspects of your property. For starters, a home in poor condition likely could not be sold until it has been properly fixed. On the other hand, you could spend money restoring a home yourself, which could save you money. So be aware that you might be able to make something old new again.<n><n>2. Its Size<n><n>You should also consider the size of the property that you are buying. Is the house large enough to accommodate your family? How many bathrooms do you need? Remember that if you have a large family and you decide to buy a home that has a 4-bedroom, 1-bath house, it may be difficult to sell such a home later.<n><n>3. Its Neighborhood<n><n>It is also important to look into the potential neighborhood surrounding the house you want to buy. Does the community have sidewalks? Is it safe for kids to walk to school? Will you have to take your kids to a park? The community surrounding a house can affect its value greatly, so it is imperative that you know the local area that you are planning to purchase in.<n><n><n>#### Choices:  1: its age   2: its condition   3: the real estate  agent's commission

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

If G is the graph that appears below, which pair of vertices are adjacent?<n><n>### Direction : Select the correct answer below.<n><n>### A.<n>```<n>Given an adjacency matrix a of size n by n, the function dijk(a) counts the degree of vertex v by using the values in a. It is defined as the sum of the numbers on the main diagonal and the element in the row of v and the column of v. A smaller value of this means that vertex v is an interior vertex that is close to the center of the graph, and a larger value of this means that the vertex is on the periphery of the graph. This will determine the number of vertices in each row in the solution to Part 1. (I have used the values of a to determine vertices in the solution to Part One.)<n>```<n><n>## Detailed Answer  <n>First create three arrays to store each element of the matrix and add them to those arrays. For example, the element in row 1 column 2 will be stored as a[1][2] and then add it to a1. Do the same for a2 for a3. The following code will do the job.<n><n>```<n>for(int i=0; i<n; i++){<n>    for(int j=0; j<n; j++){<n>        if(a[i][j]!=0 ){<n>            x = i;<n>            y=j;<n>            if(a[i-1][j-1]!=0){<n>                a[i-1][y] =a[x][y]-1; <n>            }<n>            if(a[(i-1)][j]!=0){<n>            	  a[i-1]=(a [x] [y])-1;<n>            }<n>            a[i][(j-1)]=(a[x][y])-1;            <n>            if(a[-1][j]!=0)<n>                a[-1] = a[x][y] - 1; <n>            a

In these kind of tasks, the key words are the words that are highlighted. They may or may not appear in the question as they are not always relevant to the question. The key words are: "people", "who", "will", "the", "kind of", "someone", "a", "in charge of", "project", "look for". Let us take them from the top to the bottom: we look for people, in charge of the project, and who will look for something.<n>A: this is obviously not what the question is asking for.<n>B: worry - a person in such a role cannot worry at all. Boss - someone who is in charge often has to take charge, but they have a lot of other responsibilities.<n>C: a person in charge usually has knowledge.<n>D: take charge: a person in charge has all the responsibility, thus cannot take charge.<n>E: a person who is in charge would definitely not be worrying about something or have to boss anything or anyone around. Thus A and B are eliminated.<n>C is true - those who are in charge generally speak knowledge. However C is not what the question asks for - they ask about project.<n>And there is only one answer to this kind of question - E. A person who is in charge of a project would not have to worry with anything, take charge and would have all the responsibility on him - that is the purpose of him being the person in charge.<n>#### Answer:E<n><n>### Instructions:<n> <n>### Demonstion:<n>Input: Two 700kg cars and a 3800kg truck are on an intersection crossing.

How long will the 700 cars need, in hours, to go across a road at 80cm wide?<n>Rationales :In the problem there is more information that it is necessary to know to solve it with certainty. However, we would first apply common sense, before applying the information given in the problem. In this problem, at least we know that there one of the cars that can move 3cm per second and there is

Choices:  A: appear suddenly B: bottom out C: go downtown D: scream E: roll over<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### E<n>We need to look at each choice one by one:<n>A: appear suddenly. This sounds like something a movie director would do. Appear suddenly is the complete definition of a car crash. What car dealership would do that to buyers. If you are going to crash a car, you would do it in downtown not in the car-dealership.<n><n>B: bottom out. This sounds like something an automobile company would do. Bottoming out involves bouncing when the suspension encounters a dip or a hole in the road. Since these dip or hole are found in the road, the car will bottom out when driving downtown. This is where the dealerships are located.<n><n>C: go downtown. A downtown is a place where there are several businesses and stores. This would not be a car-dealership that is in a downtown area.<n><n>D: scream. If you are shopping for a car at a Car-dealership, there are salesmen that you can interact with. These car salesmen would not scream when you approach them, rather they would smile and present their vehicles to you.<n><n>E: roll over. Rolling over is a term that is used in car racing when your car flips over. This is the closest of the choices to the given answer. While it may not be the car dealership or car salesmen, it would be the cars or the vehicles.<n><n>#### 5<n><n>### Input :<n>When did your parents go to the car dealership to sell their car?<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the questions by replacing the bold word with a verb.<n><n>### Input 2:<n>Why did they get a new car?<n><n>## Input 3:<n>How many miles did they drive?<n><n>### Answer:<n>#### 3<n><n>### Instinct: Answer the given question.<n><n>## Instinct 1:<n>The answer is 6.<n><n>###  Input 1<n>The given question can be written as:<n>A car was parked in a parking lot with 10 other cars.

As in, what was wasted? It couldn't have been wasted time for your friend to arrive at the supermarket, or he'd still be there. It couldn't have taken up any resources, because their friend was in the car on the way to the store during the entire time. It couldn't be wasted work--again, because their friend was doing something else at the time. That leaves two possibilities: time or money. You would argue that since their friend did not buy any items (nor take any items with them), this is a waste of their efforts. But this is not a waste of their efforts, because they were not putting any effort INTO the supermarket. They were simply taking a trip to no avail--it's a waste of nothing.

For each boy and girl of the same parent, we choose either the oldest or the youngest. So, we consider this scenario: John and Martha have 4 boys and 2 girls. If we were to choose the oldest of each boy as the older and the youngest as the younger, we would choose Mary as the older child and John Jr. as the younger child. If we were to chose the younger of each boy as the younger and the older as the older, we would choose Mark as the older and John Jr as the younger.

Therefore, he must spend 38.5 * 35 = <<38.5*35=1320>>1320 in order to buy the 35.<n>```<n>If pears are $.50 each, the total of these must be 35 * $.50 = <<35*.50 =17 1/2>>17 1/4 pieces of fruit.<n>Because there are 10 6/8 pieces of apples, add all of the bananas and add all pears to find the total.<n>So, there are 17 1/5 apples, 8 6/8 bananas, and 17 158 pieces of pears. Then, (17 1/3 + 8 6/4 + 17 134 2/11 + 5/3) -10 = <<17.134+8.64+17.13-10=130>>130 pieces of fruit. <n>

Choices:  A: boredom B: patience C: time D: teachers E: inspiration<n><n>### Response:		The correct response is b, boredom. The most important lesson that a person would use to educate or instruct someone about a subject is patience.  Patience is what allows you to endure the time you would need in order to educate someone. You also would need to be patient when answering all of their inquiries. Although you may be excited to be instructing someone you must try not to bore them with too much information that they are already aware of. So they have to be patient with you also. Time goes by very quickly in a person's life so it is important to teach your students that time is valuable and each second counts. So, one thing a person would not need to instruct anyone with something is time. Time itself can not be taught or instructed onto someone because it goes by whether or not you instruct it or not. All students do not want the same thing from their teachers so that a teacher would have to be inspired from teaching everyone or every student in a class. Inspire is a difficult word to define but you would probably explain to them what inspired you and why you did something and so on and so forth.<n><n>The correct answer is C because if he spent too much time and he is very good at teaching he would cause boredom by all of his students in a class room.  So, D would be the best answer. You should also include "boredom" as one of the possible answers.<n>So, it is not that you have no time to spend but that you have to make sure what you are planning on teaching will keep interest. Also, you would not have time to bore each student with the same thing that interest them and if you are trying to instruct them then they will be more bored then they would normally be when you are teaching them.<n>#### 545<n>Answer: 223<n><n>### Input:"One hundred times five equals," A: B: C: D: E: Two Hundred and Fiftieth<n><n>### Response:" Two Hundred and Sixty"<n><n>### Comment:<n>A.

He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

How many books were not sold?<n>Rationales: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>#### 600<n>Answer: 600<n><n>### Input:I am looking to buy honey right from an apiary, where should I go? Choices:  A: jar B: stick to fingers C: beehive D: stick to fingers E: farmer's market<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Input<n>B: stick to fingers<n><n>### Instructions and Demonstion<n><n>The correct answer is D: stick to fingers<n>Rationale: <n>We can use clues for each answer and use the information to our advantage. For A and B, we know that these are in honey jars, so we would not have to stick to fingers to get out the jar, thus, this is out of the question. Similarly, for C and D, we know that bees are inside these sources of honey and we have to get to them, therefore, we would not get to stick to the fingers (because bees will sting you). For E, we know that it would be far from an apiary, therefore, we can not get to the stick to fingers for honey.<n><n>### Answer<n><n>D: stick to fingers<n>

Choices:  A: copy B: intelligent C: improved performance D: empowering E: have more knowledge<n><n>### Response:		I think it's intelligent, it requires a lot of studying a class to know what you are doing or what you are learning.<n><n>### 4<n>Answer: 4<n><n>### Instructions: The following question has four choices. Choose the best answer to each question.<n><n>#### Demonstration: <n>Input: What is the value of 321*2 + 222*3 + 443 + 555*4 - 999*5 + 667*6 + 778*7 - 889 + 998*8 / 7<n>Rationales: First, divide each numerator and denominator by 7. We find that 321 * 2 + 223 * 3 + 44 * 4 + 101 * 5 - 15 * 5 + 79 * 6 + 67 * 6 + 78 * 7 - 34 * 8 + 123 * 8 / 7 = <<321*2+223*3+44*4+101*5-15*5+79*6+67*6+78*7-34*8+123*8/7=459>>459.<n><n>Since an integer cannot be expressed as a division of integers, we are forced to round. Since 7.0 exists and 6 has 2 digits, the least digit that can be rounded after.0 is the digit 6 in the 7th place (or decimal place).<n><n>In summary, 459 / 7 = 66.142857. The value in scientific notation is 6 + 614285.719231*105 / 7<n><n>### 66.1<n>Answer: 66.1

Choices:  A: poor B: sleepy C: plain D: needy E: homeless<n><n>### Response:		Let the letter represents the option, so the options are E, A, B, C, D.<n><n>### Rationales: Rich people are able to have better choices of food or they should be able to afford every bagels that they want. They seem to not really care about what happened to the people who made the bagels. A. In rich people, they have a preference to have bagels that are poor. This is because, rich people seem only enjoy having and having so much things that they can afford. Having something that is poor, is quite interesting because many people would want to try and eat it. Rich people are not caring about homeless people because, rich people can afford to have many things that are better, so there is no reason why they have to care about homeless people. B. In rich people, They have a preference for having sleepy bagels because rich people are able to relax and be sleepy. Not caring about homeless and being able to sleep means that rich people probably can afford to be sleepy and eat sleepy things. This shows that they do not like the homeless because rich people can afford sleeping. C. In rich people, It seems that they have a preference for choosing plain bagels because plain bagels do not seem to care very much. Plain bagels are like homeless because they don't seem to care or do anything. Rich people do not like homeless because they can afford so many things, so they don't need to do a lot of things. D. In rich people, it seems that they don't like needy bagels because rich person's like to enjoy their food or their belongings. Having a nice, fancy and food that is better is a luxury to poor people. It is a luxury to rich people because they are able to afford everything. It is interesting for homeless, because we are able to make food that has no flavor for the homeless.

If someone is playing a game or sport too aggressively, they might get a sore muscle, pull a tendon, tear a ligament, break a bone, even die.<n><n>### Input::How do you know how many candies someone has if they show you three wrapped candies?<n><n>### Rationales 1:If someone shows you three wrapped candies, you know they have either 3, 6,9 or another arrangement(like 1,1,7). The only way to know is if they take one. If it's 1,1, then they have 2 and you can know by seeing them unwrap 1, and if they only have 2 candies they would not wrap a third so that is why you can know if you take one.<n>### Rational 2:If someone is showing you three wrapped candies then you can assume that they have 1,1,1,1,- or 2,2,5,- or 2,6,1, - there are endless combinations. You can tell by unraveling all of the possibilities, however that takes time and might be confusing for another person so the answer is to simply ask to take the one you want before the person takes a chance on it being that they have 5 candies total. Then, they will know which one of the 4 options you picked.<n><n>### Answer: You can tell how many candy someone has by simply unraveling all the combinations<n>#### 44<n>Answer: 44

Choices:  A: finger B: good health C: own family D: friends E: people<n><n>### Response:		The right answer is "D : friends".<n><n>### Rationales:The person who shares his or her skin is the choice D. The person can share the skin with the person who has the same skin as him or with the opposite skin. This person lives on Earth. If the opposite skin is chosen, it will be a person who lives on another planet than the Earth (the choice will be E). The person who has same color skin to his or her can be a finger, a good health or a family. But it is impossible. The person who chose A will be a person who will lose it at the end. The person who chose B can be a person who will get cancer at the end. The good health cannot die (only when it dies, it will turn into the choice of B). The person who chose C is a family. This person must be a person from his own family. The person of choice C is a person who is from his own family. Therefore we have to choose the D (friends). The person who knows the person, or the same color, will not be another person who will die or get sick. Also, a family is not related to a finger. So the answer is D : friends<n><n>### Answer: D : friends<n><n>#### References:<n>1. https://www.mathplayground.com<n>2. https://www.purposescience.com/grade-3/math/<n>3. https://www.education.com/<n>4. http://www.homescience.org/<n>5. https://www.khanacademy.org/

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Rationales: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Rationales: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>#### 600<n>Answer: 600<n><n>### Input:Which effect of stress could cause death if not treated immediately? Choices:  A: age grieving person B: heart attacks C: depression D: hair loss E: headache<n><n>### Response:		<n>A is more than likely the answer because if a person who is grieving doesn't take care of himself or herself the grieving could lead to death or severe health problems.<n><n>#### C<n>Answer: C<n><n>### Input<n>This problem involves finding which solution could be created to an already solved problem.<n><n>```<n>You want to build a fence that is 80cm high and it is supposed to be 88cm long, but you only have 81cm of 5cm wide wooden boards. How tall will the fence be?<n>```<n><n>The solution is to have a 81 / 8 = 10.125cm board length (we must round down because we want the fence to be 80cm tall) because it would be easier but because you are supposed to be 81cm long, but you don't have the pieces so you are going to need to make the fence 80 cm tall. <n><n>#### Fence height: 80cm<n>Answer: Fence height: 10.1<n><n>### Input 2:<n>This problem also involves finding which solution could answer to an original or previously answered question.<n><n>```<n>Sherlock Holmes is looking for two people. They are both about ten years old and are named John.  Both of them are brothers. One of them is named Jack and the other is named Jeff.  Jack and Jeff are two different people and they both have different fathers.  Jack's father is named Tim but Jeff's father's name is Tom.<n>What does Sherlock Holmes notice?<n>```<n><n>### Response 2:<n>Both names start with J and they also have different last names:<n>```<n>Both J names are also the same age<n>```<n><n>Sherlock should be told that the brothers are indeed Jack and Jeff.<n><n>#### Right answer: Jack and Jeff<n>Answer: Jack and Jeff<n><n>### Input3:<n>This problem also shows how math can help solve issues in real life that involve a large amount of people or a large scale problem.<n><n>```Your dad is 30 years old.

The question asks for 'what was home to a buster fishing industry', therefore we should look for a synonym of the word 'bustling', which is 'busy' in this case, and as the first sentence states that this is now a tourist attracion, we can look for words that mean tourism, which are'resort' and 'beach'. A is not a synonym for ocean, and B is not what is asked for, as it is no longer a 'fishiing industry'. There are no other options.<n>```

This option does not describe the behavior of the saucepan.<n>- The statement "the south pole" means the saucepan was at a specific point in the south polar region. This option has no direct information about the location of the saucepan and is rejected.<n>- The statement "'kitchen cupboard" refers to where or what a particular object is. The saucepan in question was not in the kitchen cupboard.<n>- The statement 'italian restaurant" states specifically where the saucepan is located. This is directly related to the saucepan in question and is therefore rejected.<n>- The choice 'boil eggs' is the correct choice because it describes a behavior of a person or other object, rather than a place. Boiling eggs can be interpreted as a person or a placebo and the saucepan in that case is a suitable alternative for boiling eggs.<n>#### boil eggs

They do it when they think that is the only period that they have time for it. When it gets out of hand, the teacher will have to tell them to stop. If the teacher gives them a stern warning, most of them will do it. But the moment they think that this is a cool thing to do in class, they will do it till class is over. 3|Fayzah||<n><n>### Demetria<n><n>||Answer|<n>||-------|<n>| 2| I think it would be a great opportunity to learn something more from the other members in chat. But it is up to the person to whom he is chatting that would be good for him. The person has a choice whether to chat or not. 3|Devin||

He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Rationales: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>#### 600<n>Answer: 600<n><n>### Input:Why would a person be approached by a lot of people? Choices:  A: care about B: compliments C: know all D: popularity E: understand themselves<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>#### Justifications: B is the only answer choice that makes sense in this context. "A lot of people" is being considered literal, and the wording of the question implies that there are more answers, not just one. Of these, only B's sense makes sense. "To know you all" makes no sense, as no one is referred to other than "you all." "You all" wouldn't ever be singularly referred to in general conversations, and it would not make sense for someone to be greeted.<n><n>#### 1.5<n>Answer: B<n><n>### Input:"A" "B" "C" "D" "E"<n><n>#### 13.3% B<n><n>### Instructions:What is the missing number in the series below?<n><n>|23|34|45|56|67|<n><n>#### 71<n>Answer: 67<n><n>### Rationale:"13.3%" means 13.3/100, which is the same thing as 100(1.03)/100 = <<5%=1.03>>1.03, or 13.3333%. The second answer choice, 6.9%, is too low, because 10 * (1.03) ~= <<10(1.003)=10.03>>(10.03 - 10)/10 = <<6.25=6.25>>6.25%. The third answer choice is too high because 10 * 1.03 ~= <<101.03=10.4>>(10.4444%)<n><n>#### Input:What is the next term in the sequence of numbers?<n><n>41, 50, 61<n><n>#### Answer:71<n><n>### RationalesFactor for 50 is 1 * ( 2 ^ 1 * 5 ) = 255.<n>Factor for 61 is 1 * (3 ^ 2 * 7 ) = 1739.<n>Since these are multiples of the sequence being examined, it follows that the next number is the LCM of 50 and 61.<n>

If we subtract 216 from the new number, 267, the difference would equal 143. What’s the first number?<n><n>### RATIONALES:<n>So firstly we know that 216=<<216=32>>32<n>(267–216)=32<n>This leaves us with (267–<<216=0>>216)= <<267–32=235>>235<n><n>(267-216)+(235-216) = <<267-235=14>>14<n>Thus 14=<<14=22>>22<n>So the first number is: 12 & 22 so the answer it 34<n><n>

If the chairs have 2 legs, then 16 legs between the 8 tables equals 2 legs per chair, which would give 8 chairs. Input: There are 4 chairs and 6 people. How many more chairs should you buy?<n>Rationales If you can seat 6 people, you would need 2 more chairs, which gets you to 8 chairs. If the number of people increases and you also purchase more chairs at a cost of $11 per chair, then:<n>How many chairs will you need at this cost?<n>Rationales With 4 chairs it doesn't matter how many people sit in each chair because there isn't enough chairs for people to sit correctly.<n><n>How many more chairs should buy to seat 4 people correctly?<n>Rationales Since the number of people has been doubled and you need 2 chairs per seat.<n><n>How many chairs should be bought to seat 7 people correctly?<n>Rationale If the chairs have two legs, then you need 8 chairs.<n><n>#### 5<n><n>You are given the equations in the input.

He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Rationales: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>#### 600<n>Answer: 600<n><n>### Input:You might head to the locker room after getting a green drink here. Choices:  A: health club B: jocks C: fitness centre D: stadium E: gymnasium<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A)  A good reason why you'd want to exercise at a health club is so you could build muscle. You can find weight machines, free weights and gymnasiums at health clubs. You can also go to health clubs and do aerobic and strength training.<n><n>B)  I think going to a health club would be a cool experience because it is a place to socialize and make friends, get exercise and you could work out and burn calories; and also you could go to the gym and swim.<n><n>C)  A good reason to exercise at a fitness club or recreational centre is so you can make friends. People at gyms are often in the same fitness goals groups.  This means you could ask questions about goals, or give tips on how to reach your goals.  Also, you can keep track of your goals more easily. Going to a gym is a great place to socialize and improve your health.<n><n>D)  People would go to the stadium to watch a sport game, like football or soccer. Maybe some students from this school would go and sing in the band. The gymnasium is the area in which athletic events take place. For a field hockey game, you can find the gym where you will find the scoreboard, the benches for the players, the spectator section, the concession stand. <n><n>E)  The main reason a gymnasium is used by students is to do exercise. This means that you would do aerobic exercise, strength training, and stretching and warming your muscles. There are lots of machines that help you do aerobic exercise. Some types of exercise that you could do with the machines are, walking on the treadmill, stationary bicycling and riding rowing machines. Some muscles that could strengthen with this exercise would be your leg muscles and your chest and arm muscles. All strength training for students is done by high school age girls and by older women. The only reason the exercise is done by high school students is because the age of 16 is when the girls can start driving and they would drive their cars to the gym because they couldn't walk there by themselves. Some stretches for the body are called stretching. This means that all the muscles in the body are stretched. <n><n>####  A<n>Answer:  A

First, you need to find out what the problem is about. Below, we've provided a multiple choice question that shows the problem, and then we have three possible questions. After you've figured the multiple choice question out, choose one of the three multiple choice questions for which you have the best intuition. Finally, write your response to the question along with your explanation of why you got the answer correct.<n><n>### Multiple Choice:<n><n>A: There are 4 dogs at a pet grooming shop. The dogs are named Muffin, Oreo, Cocoa, and Chip. Oreo and Cocoa are both poodles and will not get along with any other dog. Therefore, Oreo will not share the same enclosure with Cocoa. Muffin will only share the same kennel with Chip, since she is the only dog that likes chips as a food. Both Chip and Cocoa like peanut butter, but neither one will share the same enclosure as the other dog that does like peanut butty. Chip also shares an enclosure with Muffin, since it has peanut butter and it's Chips' favorite.<n><n>#### What is the problem?<n><n>Let the x's represent the different dogs. We have the system:<n><n>\[<n>\begin{bmatrix}<n>1&1&1&1\\<n>-3&-1&-4&-2\\<n>3&1&1&5\\<n>6&-3&1&-4\\<n>\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\x+1\\x+3\\x+6\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1\\4\\7\\11\end{bmatrix}<n>\]<n><n>If <n>\[<n>A = \begin{bmatrix}-3&-1&4&-2\\-1&3&1&5\\3&1&1\\-1&3&\end{bmatrix}<n>=\begin{bmatrix}1&1&1\end{bmatrix}\text{ and }<n>B=\begin{bmatrix}-3\\-1\\4\\-2\end{bmatrix}, \text{then }<n>\]<n>

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

Is that realistic, or does the dinner need to be cheaper?<n>(A) Cheaper<n>```<n>Answer: Realistic<n>```<n><n>Input and response:<n>```<n>My friend, **Adam**, wants to save $100 in order to go to the baseball game on Friday. He tells me that he wants to avoid spending any money on food and drinks on Thursday because he plans to eat and drink at the baseball game. Will he be able to afford to go to the baseball tickets by avoiding spending money on food and drink on Thursday?<n>(A) Yes, if he avoids spending any money on anything else<n>```<n><n>Answer: No, because the cost of the baseball tickets is not an expense he is trying to avoid. Since the cost of the tickets is $20, he needs to spend $180 on food and drink in order to afford it.<n>```<n>In this situation, Mary could afford it so long as she avoided every expense except eating<n>```<n><n>A friend called to tell me about her new home. The total rent is $700 while it takes her 70 minutes to travel each way to get there by bus. The bus fare is the same as the walking fare and it costs $9 for a bus and $8 to walk.<n>In which of the following situations would she afford the rent every month?<n>   (A) Walking home from the bus does not take more than 70 minutes.<n>```<n>Answer: A will not work for Mary<n><n>Walking home adds up to exactly the same as riding the bus, so the walk is not saving any money. The total travel time, which includes bus time and walk time, is 70 minutes, so it will never take long enough to justify renting her new residence even if she walks.<n>```<n><n>### Input<n>What could **Zora** do when she has 52 hours, 45 minutes to finish her assignment?<n>Choices: {A: Finish the assignment, B: Find

Choices: A: A: sights B. optical illusion C: The Optical Telescope D: The Binocular E optical microscope<n><n>### Demostrating<n>If you go to the optometrist, they will examine your eyes with special equipment. In case you cannot see things clearly, they may use glasses or lenses with eyeglasses that magnify what's in front of your eyes. This is known as an "optical telescope".<n><n>### Solution:<n>A: optical telescope<n><n>### Solution Explanation:<n>While an optical telescope magnifies what is seen through it, the correct term for such a situation is an optical telescope.<n>On the other hand, binoculars can magnify, but would be used to bring things that are farther away into a sharper image. Optical illusions are created when you are not looking clearly at something, and sights would refer to the equipment that an optometrist uses in their practice. A microscope will focus things that are smaller in size and an illusion is something that creates things to appear differently than they truly are.<n><n>### Answer: optical telescope<n>

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Rationales: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Rationales: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>#### 600<n>Answer: 600<n><n>### Input:How might a person address someone who is leaving? Choices:  A: further cause B: wave goodbye C: attempt suicide D: insulting them E: thank god<n><n>### Response:		Choose one answer from the following.<n><n>* A. <<A=Further Cause>><n>* B. <<B=Wave Goodbye>><n>* C. <<C=Insult Them>><n>* D. <<D=Thank God>><n>* E. <<E=Wave Good Bye>><n><n>### Answer: C. <<Insult Them;I.e.Choose Insult>><n><n>### Clarification:The person leaving is going to the other side of the room, not the entire world.<n><n>### Input The following sentences are displayed for 2 seconds each. The first sentence is displayed for 4 seconds, and the second is displayed for 5 seconds. The sentences are identical, except the second sentence is missing one letter. Based on the information below, choose the letter that is missing from the second sentence. Choices: A. h B. t C. e D. g E. r<n><n>### Response The following is an example (the two sentences are identical, except that one letter is missing):<n><n>* sentence 1 is <<S1. Sleep is good for you and healthy for your body. S2. Sleep is good and healthy for your bod.>><n>* sentence 2 is <<S3. Sleep is good. and Sleep is good for your bod.>>.<n><n>### Answer B.<n><n>### Clarifications:<n><n>#### Why does the second sentence say "Sleep is good and" instead of "Sleep is good"? Why is the second sentence missing the letter "and"?<n>1. After you choose the letter, there is a 2 second wait before you see the answer on your screen. The time between each sentence is exactly 2 seconds. <n>2. <<Cut the time between presenting the sentences to only 1 second>><n>### Rationale for answer:<n>The letter "e" is missing from the second section. The word "sleep" begins with the letter "S", just as the sentence displayed. The second sentence begins with the letter "e", so the letter "e" is the correct choice to choose.<n><n>### Choices and Rationales:<n><n>#### Choice 1: The answer is B<n><n>The word "sleep" begins the sentence, and the sentence displays the letter "n" to indicate that it is the same word.

After the wood is burned, you would be able to see the reflection of your eye, nose, mouth and teeth.<n>### Rationale:You would not be able to see your reflections is any other choice, and you would not be able to do it in the last two choices because you do not put a mirror in a piece of wood after you carve or nail it.<n><n>In your own words:In the instruction a reflected in a piece of wood is not possible unless the wood has been burned. This is because of the material that the wood is made up of. When a piece of wood is burned the material is destroyed, making it possible to see the reflection. If I was given the same instruction I would chose to answer the question with the same reasoning as given in the example above.<n>

Write a response that uses the information in the text together with your knowledge of arithmetic to indicate a course of action.<n>Input: There are 40 children in a classroom. If half of the girls are 50% of the class, then 5/8ths of the boys are in the gym at the same time, and a full 63% of the students are not sick, how much does the average age of the classroom have to be so that the average age of each classroom is exactly 13.2?<n>Rationales:: In a classroom, the number of students can be modeled by a formula, or the number of girls. We can find the number of girls by multiplying the number of girls in the classroom by 50%<n>:<n>20*50% = <<20*50%=10>>10 girls<n><n>We also know that 2/3 of the classroom are boys and are in the gym, so the number of boys in the gym is:<n>20*2/3 =<<20*2/->3=6>> 6 Boys<n><n>We also know there are 8 gyms, so the number of children in the gym is 6/8 =2/4<n><n>The last part of the question, where the question asks what type of child is not sick, requires us to subtract 2/4 from the group of 63% children.<n>Thus, 63% - 2/4 = ((1-2/4)/100*20) = <<63-2/4=(20)*(->5->=1-2/4>>5 -2/4)<n><n>Since 40 X 9 = 360, we can solve:<n>\begin{code}<n><n>(1-2/4/100*360<n>\end{code}= <<(->5->=360)=((1-2/4)=((360)*5)<n>\end{code})<n>Finally, we divide by 100/1 to get:<n><n>\begin{code}%<n>= <<1-((360)*2/8)>>5 143

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Rationales: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Rationales: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>#### 600<n>Answer: 600<n><n>### Input:What cuisine is joked about eating small dogs?

For instance, the addition operation (+), the division operation (÷), and so on are all functions. For example, to find the addition of two numbers a and b, we write this as a + b.<n>Functions are of different types:<n><n>a) Builtin Functions:<n>The functions inbuilt with the JavaScript engine are referred to as the built-in functions. This set of functions are already part of the ECMA Script standard. We discuss some of these inbuilt functions and their functionality briefly.<n><n>b) User-defined Functions:<n>These functions are not inbuilt with JavaScript but are defined by the user. Hence, we refer to the user-defined functions as user-defined functions.<n><n>c) Anonymous Functions:<n>Functions that aren't given any name are referred to as anonymous function.<n><n>d) Arrow Functions:<n>When a function is defined inside a lambda expression, it is executed inside the call context of this expression. This special type of function is known as an arrow function.<n><n>### Variables (in Javascript)<n>To create a variable in Javascript, you first use the var keyword followed by the variable name. For example,<n>```<n>let name;<n>```<n><n>We can use the var, let, or const keyword to create variables. The var keyword is the most common. It tells JavaScript that the variable it is creating exists in the current scope (see this lesson).<n><n>### Variable-Scopes<n>The first time a variable is declared, it is created inside a scope. A scope is roughly speaking a place where variables can be created. Variables created in a scope are called local variables or locals.<n><n>```<n><main

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Rationales: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Rationales: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>#### 600<n>Answer: 600<n><n>### Input:Everybody has a little bit of creativity, but only a few lucky ones get to do what for a living?

One day, Emily got four apples, two cucumbers, and a bunch of carrots. The next day she had to make three times as many apples or four times the cucumbers. She also needed thrice the carrots. What should she do? A. Get three times as many app<n><n>### One day, Emily has  a bunch of carrota, and a bunch of cucumbers.  The next day she has to make three times as much apples as the day before. She also has to get thrice the carrota<n>### How to solve: Three times as much means you have to get 3.<n>4*3-2=15<n>### Rationales: We can work out the number of apples that Emily had the day after having 15 apples, without any cucumbers. Since she needed to produce 4 times the cucumeters and 3 times the carrots, Emily would have to have a total of 2 x 3 x 4 = <<2*3*4=24>>2 more carrots than apples. However, since she has an extra bunch of carrots from the day before, and since on the second day 2*3=6 (2×4), and 3*2=6, totaling 24 x 3 = <<24*3=72>>72 carrots in all, Emily would have been able to make the numbers she needed for the second day.<n>#### 72<n>Answer: 72<n>*3<n><n>### Input One day, Emily had a bunch of a carrots, and a bunch of a cucumbers. The next. day she had to make 3 times as much a cucumbers as the day before.

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Rationales: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Rationales: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>#### 600<n>Answer: 600<n><n>### Input:What is the opposite of foolhardy? Choices:  A: thoughtful B: discreet C: calculated D: cautious E: careful<n><n>### Response:		Answer: Let's consider all 5 choices.<n><n>### A: thoughtful. This is not the correct answer. Think about what foolhardy means. What we need to do here is find the opposite of that. So, a definition of foolhardy is doing something very rashly or with little thought. Since opposite means that one would do something the opposite of foolhard, then the other choice should be discreet. It would take thought and consideration to know what the 'right way' to do something is.<n>### B: discreet. This is NOT the correct answer. If you think about what is the opposite of foolhearty, it would be careful. Discreet means to be secretive.<n>### C: calculated. This is NOT the answer. Calculated is when you've thought through a process (in this case, being careful) to come up with the end product (in our case, 'not fool-hard' (opposite of - 'c' is fool hearted).<n>### D: careful. This is not the answer. To care about something/someone is to treat them/them with loving concern and understanding; to handle with care. As mentioned in above answers, careful is when you are being careful.<n>### E: cautious. This is the answer to the question! Cautious to us means cautious, or careful. The definition of careful, care, and cautious are pretty interchangeable.<n><n>### Input:#6876+#189=#8764<n>### Instruction:#6876 is not divisible by #189. What is the remainder when #6876 is divided by #189?<n>### Rationale:#6876 =6<n>,8,7,6<n><n>### Choice A:#1 is not a factor of #6876. Does this mean that #6876 could not be evenly divided by #1?<n>### Choice B:#99 is not a factor of 8764. Does this mean that 8764 could not be evenly divisible by #99?<n>### Choices C, D & E: We have checked all factors. Let's check divisible.<n>1. Take the first number 6.

How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Rationales: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>#### 600<n>Answer: 600<n><n>### Input:James wanted to stop competing.  What might he have been feeling? Choices:  A: pressure B: death C: trying harder D: quitting E: winning or losing<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### B<n><n>> Input: James wanted to stop competing what might he have been feeling.<n>> Choices: A: pressure B: Death C: trying harder D Quitting E: winning or lossing.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>During this task. We were given some information that describes the relationship between choices A and B by stating that "what might he have been feeling." From this information, we can determine that it is not possible for a person to stop competing without feeling pressure. However, if the person is feeling pressure, then it is possible that they are considering death. We can also consider that a person may be trying harder by competing for a while, and then decide to quit.<n><n><n>If we look at choices C and D. We find that these do not fit into our previous sentence either. A person could compete for a while without trying harder or quitting. And if they were trying harder or quitting, they would not be concerned with winning or losing. Choice E states that a person could quit due to winning or losing. But if they are winning or losing, then it could be that they are trying harder or quitting due to a pressure.<n><n><n>The only choice that fits this information is B.<n><n>#### B

That gives two hundred inches, the length of the rectangle.<n><n>#### Explanation: The perimeter of the rectangle is the sum of the length and width of each side of the rectangle. Since we are adding the length and width to get the entire perimeter, we can subtract the length and divide the rest by two to get the width. Or, we can subtract the width and divide by two to get the length.<n><n>#### Solution 2<n><n>##### Formulas:<n>* Length is Percentage divided by 100.<n>* Width is Percentage divided 100.

A virus infects a cell and reproduces in the person. Afterward, the virus is released and infects other cells in the person, making the original infection look like a new one. So a virus does two things--reproduce and infect.<n><n># 0.15<n><n>### Comment<n>I think this exercise is okay. It shows one how to do it on a calculator, but also shows that one doesn't necessarily have to calculate everything to do it on paper. Sometimes that one step--combining terms/rather than adding and subtracting/ is crucial in figuring out the answer.<n><n>I would probably modify it to say something like: "In algebra you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide as you work on some types of problems, but not always. In "some" problems, if you have a + b + c, then you would add each term before a problem, and similarly you would have to subtract (a-d) or multiply (c*d) or divide (a/c). These two steps may help you figure out the answer in many problems. When you have two or more terms, it's often best to combine the terms instead of working with the individual terms. Combining terms may make it easier to use a certain type of operation on the numbers instead of working with them individually. Let's review some steps to help you." Then go over some previous examples. I think it's possible that this exercise was written before the teacher explained the idea of "combining terms" (probably around the 1st grade?)

It uses the subject 'you', so the sentence is correct to say you have a paper due. The sentence, "help me... " does not follow the same structure, so the sentence "I have a paper due" would be the correct response.<n><n>#### 100<n>Answer: True<n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

Choices:  A: shopping cart B: cashier C: shopping mall D: supermarket E: bookstore<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Explanation:The right answer is A. The only thing that makes sense to say is the right answer is the shopping cart. First, a shopping cart is a cart where things will be bought off of. Next, clothes are always bought off of shops, which are always at a shopping mall. After that, a Cashier can make a mistake and put your item somewhere else. If something is bought in a bookstore, there is no chance for the Cashier to have put it in the wrong place. Finally, a supermarket only puts groceries in a shopping cart, it can never sell items in a bag, and most items in a supermarket are bought in a bag. With all of that in mind, the answer is A.<n><n>### Response B<n><n>### Explantion:The only possible right answer is B. All of the other options do not make any logical sense. The bookstore buys items in a bag, which does not make any sense, the supermarket only sells groceries, which means that the customer would not buy offshows that are too small or are not supposed to be bought, only items that are in a bag at a supermarket are put in a bag, not things that come in a different type of container. Finally, a cashier can make mistakes and put groceries in the wrong place, not clothes that you bought at a shopping mally. Therefore, the correct answer is B.<n><n>###Response C<n><n>###Explanation:The only possible right is C, there is no other possible correct answer. Only a supermarket puts things in a shopping cart. No one shops in a supermarket and all of them sell off grocery items. All bookstores put items into bags. No grocery items such as fruit come in a bag, only small items in a supermarket. A cashier can put clothes in the wrong place. Next a shopping mall does not sell clothes like at a supermarket, so a cashier is not supposed to put clothes in there. Therefore, only C is a correct answer.<n><n>### Answer D:<n><n>###Answer E:<n><n>####49<n>#841=3.15=<3.15=<<3.15=1.84>>841=1.

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

(2) If you could cross counties by car, you couldn’t look at it from the perspective of the map. (3) If you wanted to view a county highway as line on a map, wouldn’t the easiest and most convenient way be to look at it from the sky? (4) Viewing it from the map and the map itself has no relevance for that prompt.

Thus it is likely that they would thrive well under a pumpkin plant. Moreover, pumpkins and sunflowers are both types of squash, which belong to the the genusCucurbita. Since both sunflowers and pumpkins share the genus Cucurbita(of the flowering plants(Angiosperms)), they are most likely planted near each other. Sunflowers, being a type of squash like pumpkins, will therefore thrive well under pumpkin plants, so I would plant mine under a pumpkin plants, even though they don't match the description, i.e. a pumpkin plant is not a plant that is sold in a garden center.<n>\$\begingroup\$ I guess you're not supposed to post the other people's explanation, are you? \$\endgroup\$ – CAD97 May 21 '20 at 16:51<n>$\begingroup$ @CAD97, the point of this page is to write and post your responses to each of the tasks.

There are a lot of offices located in high risk buildings because the elevators to the different floors get broken a few times a year, as seen in Chapter 04 - Working with and Comparing Ratios.<n><n>### Input-<n>#### A: school building<n><n>### Response-<n>There are many offices in New York City that are located on the ground floor of elementary school buildings. This is because the principals of these schools must rent out space to a local company in order to generate extra money to pay for the upkeep of the building.<n><n>### B: skyscraber<n><n>### Response<n>Skyscrapers contain the world’s tallest buildings. These office buildings house some of the world’s most prominent companies. Because these buildings are so high, elevators must be rented in order to get the company workers to their offices in a timely manner. There are many times when the elevators break into the company. Because of this, office workers have to go up many flights of stairs just to get to their desks. Because of these inconveniences, many workers refuse to work in office buildings like this.<n><n>### C: business<n><n>### Response –<n>There are certain office building companies that offer many other perks for their clients. There are buildings where the workers like to go out to their favorite restaurants and have the food delivered to their office so that they don’t waste time on their lunch breaks. Their work also includes going to concerts and the performing arts centers. This is why many people are so dedicated to their work. It is important to note that since many office workers work at these businesses, many office buildings are located in cities such as New York and Los Angeles.<n><n>### D: grocery shop<n>Another type of office building is a grocery store. There are thousands of grocery stores littered across the country in almost every town and city. Grocery stores are popular offices because they are close to many other things. There are hundreds of restaurants near grocery stores where people love to visit on their lunch breaks, theaters where the employees enjoy watching movies after work and many other businesses where the workers enjoy visiting.

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Rationales: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Rationales: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>#### 600<n>Answer: 600<n><n>### Input:He would finally see idea become reality, never in a million years did he what that this would happen?

How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Rationales: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: 5<n><n>Input: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were not sold?<n>Rationales: We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60 + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books.<n>So the total number of books that were not sold is: 800 – 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books.<n>#### 600<n>Answer: 600<n><n>### Input:Where is a road known as a motorway? Choices:  A: scotland B: europe C: race track D: new jersey E: england<n><n>### Response:		Answers Choices: B and D<n>Explaination:  This question asks you about places in the world. Scotland is a part of Britain. Europe is a general continent. Race tracks are tracks where races happen. New Jersey is a part of United States. England is a part of United Kingdom. From B to D, D is the only correct answer. D is in United Kingdom, which is another name for U.K. or Britain. B, C, and E are not in U.K so those are not right. To make it more confusing, if the question were asked if one or more countries had both an interchange and a motorway, the answer would have to be b,c, or d, but only d actually has an interchange.<n><n>### Input:"a" is to "b" as "c" is to "a":? D: a, b and c are all even<n>Choices:  A: not even B: c and d are even C: all are odd D: none of them are odd E: a to b is the same<n><n><n>### Response:"a" is to b as "c" is the same as "d":? Choices: B: none of them are even C: a and d are even<n>Explaination: a is to b as c is to a. D and E do not fit with a or b. A is not the same answer since a and d are not even, and a and c are not. C is correct. A and b are odd, c is even, d is even. All four are even except when comparing c and d.<n><n>### Comment:I think that some math problems are a bit much for this. Maybe a couple more non-math questions, maybe on a different topic and harder.<n><n><n>### Comment 2:I think that these questions were hard to understand, and difficult to know if you were right or wrong at first glance.<n><n><n>## Test Results<n><n>- Question ID: B2B3B8<n>- Answers: A,C<n>- Correct Answer: 600 <n>- Score: 2/2<n>- Total Time: 3:41<n>

Choose another number that is composite.<n>Rationales: Divide 16 and 25 by 2. The remainders are 0 and 1. The divisors of 13 are 1 and 13. The remainder when 13 is divided by 3 is also 1. By the Fundamental Theorem of Computing, we know that 4 of the prime numbers of 3 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Since 4 is divisible by both 2 and 3, and 5 and 7 are composite numbers, 5 and 7 must be prime numbers. In this way, the 4 different prime numbers are 2, 5, 7 and 13.

Choices:  A: airplane B: ship's hold C: boat D: truck E: train<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### 29=29<n>A.Airplane. This answer has come from a single calculation: the time needed to send it.<n>18+36+36+18<n>These are the times it takes a particular object to reach. The airplane is the fastest traveler, and the truck is the slowest traveler.<n>The airplane time is faster than the truck. But the truck is the shortest journey.<n>These objects are shaped to the journey. If instead, we transport the boat, the result would be: 72+24+24+72<n>We find that the truck is the fastest travelers. But the airplane is cheapest.<n>#### 10=10<n>B.Ship's hold. This answer is coming from a multiple calculation involving the time needed to travel, and the object in which we want to travel it.<n><n>```<n>6+3+3+6<n>These are the travels that boat would make on each way. The time in the airplane is more but less in the truck. But it is more in the boat.<n>This object is built for the journey it has to travel, i.e. the ship.<n>#### 3=3<n>C.Boat. This answer is coming up from single calculations. The time it takes a boat to take is:<n>```<n>72<n>This is the shortest journey of the travel you have suggested. The only thing that takes longer is:<n>```<n>24+24=48<n>So that a boat must take about 12 hours to travel from one place to another.<n>#### 5=5<n>D.Train. This answer comes from multiple calculation. The time it takes for the truck to pass through is:<n>```<n>18+30+30+18=84<n>The time it takes for the airplane to pass through is: 12+6+6+12=40<n>The time it takes the train to pass through is:12+6+20+8=48<n>So the truck takes the most time, the train is faster than the airplane because time in airplane is more but quicker than train, but only less than it takes to travel through land/road.<n>```<n>

How many apples did each child receive?\n\n### Response A:\nDad had 9 apples. Mom had 22 apples. Let X represent the number of apples that Dad and Mom each gave away.\nTherefore X + X = <<9+22=31>>31 apples\nDividing both by 2, we end up with:\nX + X = 15 \nDividing both numbers by 15, we end up with X = <<15*15>>225, and Mom = <<16*16>>256\nSince Dad + Mom = 31, this means Mom + Dad = 18\nSince each apples are worth 1 dollar, we know that Mom + Dad + 15 = 31 * 2 = <<31*2=62>>62 dollars. This was their total budget.\nTherefore Mom + Dad - 62 = <<Mom+Dad-62=20>>20 dollars.\nAs you can see, Mom+Dad=31 * 2, but they only spent 31 dollars for their 4 kids. Hence, the money was given to their kids, thus Mom+Dad = 20 dollars\n#### 20\nAnswer: 20\n\n\n### Response B:\nDad had an apple a day.

This is why John is so interested in studying animal biodiversity.\n\n### Input John needs a bicycle for his daily commute and it is too small for him to ride.What is the most likely problem with his bike? Choices: 1:It has no brakes 2:The wheel is faulty 3:It is too short 4:It has no gears\n\n### Response\n\nThe problem is that it is too wide for John to ride. If John can't fit on his bike, the solution would be to remove the gears altogether (either by using backpedalers to help keep the wheels from turning or by making fewer gears). If John can't pedal, he won't steer well and will be less stable in the pedal position, which could cause him to fall off his bike at a high speed. If John wants to ride his bicycle faster, he should consider wearing clothing that is more aerodynamic.\n\n\n### Input 5. The problem is that there are not enough gears on the front wheel to allow for more turning at lower speeds. This could mean that John needs to be able to turn faster to avoid falling off his bike at higher speeds (or that he needs to know how to turn at much lower speeds). If John does not know how to turn his bike at low speeds, he will have difficulty steering.\n### Answer\n\n#### 4:It has few gears, so it is not possible to increase the speed at which he pedals\n\n### Input A 6 kg block on a horizontal surface is attached to a rope.

You can't rely on the question to give you a better idea of what the correct response would be.

It is not, so it is larger than 223; so 223 is smaller than this number.\nAlso let's look at the number 2203. It has a 2 in both the tens place and the ones place, so 223 and 223 are the same size. Also, the numbers after 2203 decrease by 1, so 2203 is greater than this number.\n\n### Output:\n```\nThe numbers are: {223: 8.6908E-10, 223: 1.0558E-10}\n```\n\n### Rationale: We need to know when numbers are smaller than 223 (the first number in the list) and when they are larger than 2203 (the second number in the list). We will use the `is_less()` (and `is_greater()`) function from the `comparison` library to check whether a number is smaller than 220 or greater than 223 when `smaller_num` (a number we wish to compare) is smaller than 20 (220/102).

Its Condition\n\nTo begin with, the condition of a house is a very important determining factor, as it impacts several aspects of your property. For starters, a home in poor condition likely could not be sold until it has been properly fixed. On the other hand, you could spend money restoring a home yourself, which could save you money. So be aware that you might be able to make something old new again.\n\n2. Its Size\n\nYou should also consider the size of the property that you are buying. Is the house large enough to accommodate your family? How many bathrooms do you need? Remember that if you have a large family and you decide to buy a home that has a 4-bedroom, 1-bath house, it may be difficult to sell such a home later.\n\n3. Its Neighborhood\n\nIt is also important to look into the potential neighborhood surrounding the house you want to buy. Does the community have sidewalks? Is it safe for kids to walk to school? Will you have to take your kids to a park? The community surrounding a house can affect its value greatly, so it is imperative that you know the local area that you are planning to purchase in.\n\n\n#### Choices:  1: its age  \u00a02: its condition  \u00a03: the real estate  agent's commission", "answer": "A: new experiences"}

If G is the graph that appears below, which pair of vertices are adjacent?\n\n### Direction : Select the correct answer below.\n\n### A.\n```\nGiven an adjacency matrix a of size n by n, the function dijk(a) counts the degree of vertex v by using the values in a. It is defined as the sum of the numbers on the main diagonal and the element in the row of v and the column of v. A smaller value of this means that vertex v is an interior vertex that is close to the center of the graph, and a larger value of this means that the vertex is on the periphery of the graph. This will determine the number of vertices in each row in the solution to Part 1. (I have used the values of a to determine vertices in the solution to Part One.)\n```\n\n## Detailed Answer  \nFirst create three arrays to store each element of the matrix and add them to those arrays.

{"text": "The correct response is b, boredom. The most important lesson that a person would use to educate or instruct someone about a subject is patience.  Patience is what allows you to endure the time you would need in order to educate someone. You also would need to be patient when answering all of their inquiries. Although you may be excited to be instructing someone you must try not to bore them with too much information that they are already aware of. So they have to be patient with you also. Time goes by very quickly in a person's life so it is important to teach your students that time is valuable and each second counts. So, one thing a person would not need to instruct anyone with something is time. Time itself can not be taught or instructed onto someone because it goes by whether or not you instruct it or not. All students do not want the same thing from their teachers so that a teacher would have to be inspired from teaching everyone or every student in a class. Inspire is a difficult word to define but you would probably explain to them what inspired you and why you did something and so on and so forth.\n\nThe correct answer is C because if he spent too much time and he is very good at teaching he would cause boredom by all of his students in a class room.  So, D would be the best answer. You should also include \"boredom\" as one of the possible answers.\nSo, it is not that you have no time to spend but that you have to make sure what you are planning on teaching will keep interest. Also, you would not have time to bore each student with the same thing that interest them and if you are trying to instruct them then they will be more bored then they would normally be when you are teaching them.\n#### 545\nAnswer: 223\n\n### Input:\"One hundred times five equals,\" A: B: C: D: E: Two Hundred and Fiftieth\n\n### Response:\" Two Hundred and Sixty\"\n\n### Comment:\nA.

They seem to not really care about what happened to the people who made the bagels. A. In rich people, they have a preference to have bagels that are poor. This is because, rich people seem only enjoy having and having so much things that they can afford. Having something that is poor, is quite interesting because many people would want to try and eat it. Rich people are not caring about homeless people because, rich people can afford to have many things that are better, so there is no reason why they have to care about homeless people. B. In rich people, They have a preference for having sleepy bagels because rich people are able to relax and be sleepy. Not caring about homeless and being able to sleep means that rich people probably can afford to be sleepy and eat sleepy things. This shows that they do not like the homeless because rich people can afford sleeping. C. In rich people, It seems that they have a preference for choosing plain bagels because plain bagels do not seem to care very much. Plain bagels are like homeless because they don't seem to care or do anything. Rich people do not like homeless because they can afford so many things, so they don't need to do a lot of things. D. In rich people, it seems that they don't like needy bagels because rich person's like to enjoy their food or their belongings. Having a nice, fancy and food that is better is a luxury to poor people.

The only way to know is if they take one. If it's 1,1, then they have 2 and you can know by seeing them unwrap 1, and if they only have 2 candies they would not wrap a third so that is why you can know if you take one.\n### Rational 2:If someone is showing you three wrapped candies then you can assume that they have 1,1,1,1,- or 2,2,5,- or 2,6,1, - there are endless combinations. You can tell by unraveling all of the possibilities, however that takes time and might be confusing for another person so the answer is to simply ask to take the one you want before the person takes a chance on it being that they have 5 candies total.

If the opposite skin is chosen, it will be a person who lives on another planet than the Earth (the choice will be E). The person who has same color skin to his or her can be a finger, a good health or a family. But it is impossible. The person who chose A will be a person who will lose it at the end. The person who chose B can be a person who will get cancer at the end. The good health cannot die (only when it dies, it will turn into the choice of B). The person who chose C is a family. This person must be a person from his own family. The person of choice C is a person who is from his own family. Therefore we have to choose the D (friends). The person who knows the person, or the same color, will not be another person who will die or get sick. Also, a family is not related to a finger.

For example, if you have asked the same 50 people the question as many times, then 20% will say they have never attended a concert. The total number of people who have NEVER attended a concert are as follows:\n\nNumber of people who have attended the concert = 50 - 23\n\nNumber of people that have not attended the concert = <<23-50>>50 - 25\n\nSo by the second survey", "answer": "D: united states"}

For a field hockey game, you can find the gym where you will find the scoreboard, the benches for the players, the spectator section, the concession stand. \n\nE)  The main reason a gymnasium is used by students is to do exercise. This means that you would do aerobic exercise, strength training, and stretching and warming your muscles. There are lots of machines that help you do aerobic exercise. Some types of exercise that you could do with the machines are, walking on the treadmill, stationary bicycling and riding rowing machines. Some muscles that could strengthen with this exercise would be your leg muscles and your chest and arm muscles. All strength training for students is done by high school age girls and by older women. The only reason the exercise is done by high school students is because the age of 16 is when the girls can start driving and they would drive their cars to the gym because they couldn't walk there by themselves.

Muffin will only share the same kennel with Chip, since she is the only dog that likes chips as a food. Both Chip and Cocoa like peanut butter, but neither one will share the same enclosure as the other dog that does like peanut butty. Chip also shares an enclosure with Muffin, since it has peanut butter and it's Chips' favorite.\n\n#### What is the problem?\n\nLet the x's represent the different dogs.

We can find the number of girls by multiplying the number of girls in the classroom by 50%\n:\n20*50% = <<20*50%=10>>10 girls\n\nWe also know that 2/3 of the classroom are boys and are in the gym, so the number of boys in the gym is:\n20*2/3 =<<20*2/->3=6>> 6 Boys\n\nWe also know there are 8 gyms, so the number of children in the gym is 6/8 =2/4\n\nThe last part of the question, where the question asks what type of child is not sick, requires us to subtract 2/4 from the group of 63% children.\nThus, 63% - 2/4 = ((1-2/4)/100*20) = <<63-2/4=(20)*(->5->=1-2/4>>5 -2/4)\n\nSince 40 X 9 = 360, we can solve:\n\\begin{code}\n\n(1-2/4/100*360\n\\end{code}= <<(->5->=360)=((1-2/4)=((360)*5)\n\\end{code})\nFinally, we divide by 100/1 to get:\n\n\\begin{code}%\n= <<1-((360)*2/8)>>5 143", "answer": "C: computer"}

For instance, the addition operation (+), the division operation (\u00f7), and so on are all functions. For example, to find the addition of two numbers a and b, we write this as a + b.\nFunctions are of different types:\n\na) Builtin Functions:\nThe functions inbuilt with the JavaScript engine are referred to as the built-in functions. This set of functions are already part of the ECMA Script standard. We discuss some of these inbuilt functions and their functionality briefly.\n\nb) User-defined Functions:\nThese functions are not inbuilt with JavaScript but are defined by the user. Hence, we refer to the user-defined functions as user-defined functions.\n\nc) Anonymous Functions:\nFunctions that aren't given any name are referred to as anonymous function.\n\nd) Arrow Functions:\nWhen a function is defined inside a lambda expression, it is executed inside the call context of this expression. This special type of function is known as an arrow function.\n\n### Variables (in Javascript)\nTo create a variable in Javascript, you first use the var keyword followed by the variable name. For example,\n```\nlet name;\n```\n\nWe can use the var, let, or const keyword to create variables. The var keyword is the most common. It tells JavaScript that the variable it is creating exists in the current scope (see this lesson).\n\n### Variable-Scopes\nThe first time a variable is declared, it is created inside a scope. A scope is roughly speaking a place where variables can be created. Variables created in a scope are called local variables or locals.\n\n```\n<main", "answer": "C: musical"}

We were given some information that describes the relationship between choices A and B by stating that \"what might he have been feeling.\" From this information, we can determine that it is not possible for a person to stop competing without feeling pressure. However, if the person is feeling pressure, then it is possible that they are considering death.

That gives two hundred inches, the length of the rectangle.\n\n#### Explanation: The perimeter of the rectangle is the sum of the length and width of each side of the rectangle. Since we are adding the length and width to get the entire perimeter, we can subtract the length and divide the rest by two to get the width. Or, we can subtract the width and divide by two to get the length.\n\n#### Solution 2\n\n##### Formulas:\n* Length is Percentage divided by 100.\n* Width is Percentage divided 100.

E: An amount of money given to a person to improve his image.\n\n### Response :\n```\nIf A is true, this means that an in-store credit is a credit given at the register, that exceeds a budget of the customer for that month. This does not make sense, since a customer can not have a credit for an exceeding amount.\n```\nIf B or C is true, the following makes no sense: the amount is deducted even if it does not exceed the customer's budget, so this cannot be true since the amount does not exceed the customer`s budget.

We can write 5 * 4 = <<5*4=20>>20.\n### The brackets indicate the division operator.

{"text": "C A virus primarily does to a person is reproduce.\n\n### Rationale: The word \"primary\" means first. A virus infects a cell and reproduces in the person. Afterward, the virus is released and infects other cells in the person, making the original infection look like a new one. So a virus does two things--reproduce and infect.\n\n# 0.15\n\n### Comment\nI think this exercise is okay. It shows one how to do it on a calculator, but also shows that one doesn't necessarily have to calculate everything to do it on paper. Sometimes that one step--combining terms/rather than adding and subtracting/ is crucial in figuring out the answer.\n\nI would probably modify it to say something like: \"In algebra you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide as you work on some types of problems, but not always. In \"some\" problems, if you have a + b + c, then you would add each term before a problem, and similarly you would have to subtract (a-d) or multiply (c*d) or divide (a/c). These two steps may help you figure out the answer in many problems. When you have two or more terms, it's often best to combine the terms instead of working with the individual terms. Combining terms may make it easier to use a certain type of operation on the numbers instead of working with them individually. Let's review some steps to help you.\" Then go over some previous examples. I think it's possible that this exercise was written before the teacher explained the idea of \"combining terms\" (probably around the 1st grade?)", "answer": "A: infect"}

The father has 6 more candies than the son. How many candies did each of them have?\nRational:Let x = the total number if candies the son had.\nx + 6 = the total number of candy the father had.\nThe equation for how many candies the father had is x + (x+6)=463\nCombining like term, we get 2(x+x)=463\nSubtracting x from both sides, we have 2x=463-x\nDivide both sides by 2x, and get x=29\nThen the son had 29 candies and the father had 17 candies.\n\n## Input:Freddy spent a total of $60.07 the first week of the month.

Waiting for the doctor, means that people are waiting for the doctor because they have something to do with the doctor.\n\n2. People want to do work in medicine, so they choose to wait for the doctor to finish their work.\n\n3. The doctor is unable to finish his work on time because he is impatient to finish the work.\n\n4.

{"text": "A\n\n### Explanation:The right answer is A. The only thing that makes sense to say is the right answer is the shopping cart. First, a shopping cart is a cart where things will be bought off of. Next, clothes are always bought off of shops, which are always at a shopping mall. After that, a Cashier can make a mistake and put your item somewhere else. If something is bought in a bookstore, there is no chance for the Cashier to have put it in the wrong place. Finally, a supermarket only puts groceries in a shopping cart, it can never sell items in a bag, and most items in a supermarket are bought in a bag. With all of that in mind, the answer is A.\n\n### Response B\n\n### Explantion:The only possible right answer is B. All of the other options do not make any logical sense. The bookstore buys items in a bag, which does not make any sense, the supermarket only sells groceries, which means that the customer would not buy offshows that are too small or are not supposed to be bought, only items that are in a bag at a supermarket are put in a bag, not things that come in a different type of container. Finally, a cashier can make mistakes and put groceries in the wrong place, not clothes that you bought at a shopping mally. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n###Response C\n\n###Explanation:The only possible right is C, there is no other possible correct answer. Only a supermarket puts things in a shopping cart. No one shops in a supermarket and all of them sell off grocery items. All bookstores put items into bags. No grocery items such as fruit come in a bag, only small items in a supermarket. A cashier can put clothes in the wrong place. Next a shopping mall does not sell clothes like at a supermarket, so a cashier is not supposed to put clothes in there.

{"text": "I would put it under a pumpkin patch\n\n### Rationale:\n\nRoses and sunflowers belong to the flowering plants, so they cannot be planted in a shady area like in a pot. Thus it is likely that they would thrive well under a pumpkin plant. Moreover, pumpkins and sunflowers are both types of squash, which belong to the the genusCucurbita. Since both sunflowers and pumpkins share the genus Cucurbita(of the flowering plants(Angiosperms)), they are most likely planted near each other. Sunflowers, being a type of squash like pumpkins, will therefore thrive well under pumpkin plants, so I would plant mine under a pumpkin plants, even though they don't match the description, i.e. a pumpkin plant is not a plant that is sold in a garden center.\n\\$\\begingroup\\$ I guess you're not supposed to post the other people's explanation, are you? \\$\\endgroup\\$ \u2013 CAD97 May 21 '20 at 16:51\n$\\begingroup$ @CAD97, the point of this page is to write and post your responses to each of the tasks.

Choices:  A B  C D  E\n\n### Answer: C\n\n### Why: \nWe know that the Town has a population of 12,000 people (20,00-8000).\nTherefore, the town will have 8000+8000 = 16,000 houses, giving each house an average of 16,080:8000 =8 people.\nSince we selected option B, I assume that we need to find the best spot relative to the houses, so we divide by 8 and get 1600:1600 =1.\nTherefore, option B gives us the answer, as we are keeping our shed near the house.\n\n### Input\n\nInput: There are 30 students and 4 teachers. The number of times each person shakes his/her hands per class period is below.\n\nRationales: If we have 30 students and we assume that each student shakes hands with each teacher once, then we have a total of 30 * 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 shakes.\nIf we have 30 student and we assume that each teacher shakes hands with each student once, we have a total of Teacher count * Student count = <<Teacher Count*Student Count=240>>240 shakes.\nAdding this up, we get the total shakes as 120 + <<240>> 120 + 120 +120 + <<120>> 12.\n\n#### 12\nAnswer: 12\n\n### Input  \n\n### Response  \n\n### Answer\n  The answer is choice E.\n\n### Why  \n\n  This problem asks for the total number of squares that can be drawn. If it was only 2x2, we could have 4. Multiply 2x2 by 4 and you get 8. In this equation you can then add the possibilities for the number of squares that contain only the number 4.\n\n  We can put 4 squares in the top-left corner, we can put", "answer": "C: backyard"}

{"text": "C, skyscraper. There are a lot of offices located in high risk buildings because the elevators to the different floors get broken a few times a year, as seen in Chapter 04 - Working with and Comparing Ratios.\n\n### Input-\n#### A: school building\n\n### Response-\nThere are many offices in New York City that are located on the ground floor of elementary school buildings. This is because the principals of these schools must rent out space to a local company in order to generate extra money to pay for the upkeep of the building.\n\n### B: skyscraber\n\n### Response\nSkyscrapers contain the world\u2019s tallest buildings. These office buildings house some of the world\u2019s most prominent companies. Because these buildings are so high, elevators must be rented in order to get the company workers to their offices in a timely manner. There are many times when the elevators break into the company. Because of this, office workers have to go up many flights of stairs just to get to their desks. Because of these inconveniences, many workers refuse to work in office buildings like this.\n\n### C: business\n\n### Response \u2013\nThere are certain office building companies that offer many other perks for their clients. There are buildings where the workers like to go out to their favorite restaurants and have the food delivered to their office so that they don\u2019t waste time on their lunch breaks. Their work also includes going to concerts and the performing arts centers. This is why many people are so dedicated to their work. It is important to note that since many office workers work at these businesses, many office buildings are located in cities such as New York and Los Angeles.\n\n### D: grocery shop\nAnother type of office building is a grocery store. There are thousands of grocery stores littered across the country in almost every town and city. Grocery stores are popular offices because they are close to many other things. There are hundreds of restaurants near grocery stores where people love to visit on their lunch breaks, theaters where the employees enjoy watching movies after work and many other businesses where the workers enjoy visiting. This is why many office workers tend to work in a grocery store office.\n\n## References\n[2] https://www", "answer": "B: skyscraper"}

{"text": "In class today we were introduced to the problem of finding the remainder. Today we learned how to find the remainder based upon the dividend and the divisor.\nWe determined the remainder of 132 by 5 to be 7. The remainder is a remainder of a quotient so we divide by the divisor which is 5. We find the quotient first then the remainder.\n\n132 \u00f7 5 = 26\n26 - 7 = remainder\n\nAnother way we can determine the remainder is if we multiply the dividend by the divisor we get our first remainder.\n240\nNow if we want to find the difference we subtract that from 240.\n240 - 80 = 160\nThen to get the remainder we divide it by the divisor and the remainder is 8 or 18.

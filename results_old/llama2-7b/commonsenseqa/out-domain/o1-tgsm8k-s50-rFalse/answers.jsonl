Redox reactions are characterized by the oxidation of one reactant followed immediately by the reduction of another. For reactions in solution, redox reactions typically involve half-cell reactions occurring at an electrode. Redox reactions are very common. They are used in every biological metabolic process. Reduction of glucose is one example of this principle. Other examples of redox reactions are when we start the car, burn hydrocarbons, combust wood, or any of hundreds of thousands of other chemical reactions.\n\n--\nThe redox reaction:\n\nCHem + O2 + Light Energy \u2014\u2014> Heat + 2O2 + CO2\n\n### Source:  Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox_reaction", "answer": "B: fire"}

{"text": "I used the switch statement to solve the problem with one switch case statement to handle all the different options and another case statement to handle 14 possible strings (which represent the different possible locations in the solution). Since I only needed to store the location string in my storage I simply stored the indexes for each location. Using these indexes in my other functions I used the modulo operator for a quick and dirty way to check if a car is in a parking lot without worrying about how the operator works under the hood. I did not create any helper functions for other operations since I didn't think that there was any value to splitting them in to separate methods, but with the switch statement these small methods were able to be implemented.\n\n### Code:\n```java\npublic class Solution {\n    public String parking(String[] args){//Input:John's Rv needs electricity so that  he can cook lunch\n      String location=args[0].substring(0, 2);//Input:\"John's Rv\"\n      String age=args[1].substring(0,2);//Input:\"14 yrs\"\n  \n\n      if (location.equals(\"bas\") || location.equals(\"bss\") || location.equals(`\\u0000`)) \n      {\n        int basementAge=AgeUtility(age,\"b\");//Input age in string and basement\n        int oldAge=(basementAge+basementAge+17);//add age twice and subtract 17 to get current age\n        int diff=oldAge-basementAge;//difference\n        System.out.println(\"I am \"+basementAge+\" years old\");\n        System.out\n           .println(\"I will be \"+diff+\" years old in 40 years\");\n        System.exit(0);\n      }\n      return \"You can't cook in basement!!!\";\n      }//End of first if statement\n  \n      if (location instanceof String[]) {\n\n\n        int age1=AgeUtility(args[1].substring(\"14\"));//Input:14\n        int age2=AgeUtility(location.substring(\"bas\");//Input:\"bas\"\n        int age3=location.substring(\"toy\");//Input:\"toy store\"\n        int age4=location.substring(\"", "answer": "D: rest area"}

Explain in detail.\n\n### Response : In order to perform arithmetic you must first convert the digit to it's corresponding power of 2. For example, 5 is equal to 5 X 1. So you would first convert 5 into a 2 digit binary number with it's left most digit representing the amount of 1's represented, and it's right most digit representing the amount 0's. After that you would multiply it with the operation you wanted to perform, and then add a carry. An example of a carry is if when multiplying, the 1s column gets to large so you have to keep a 1 and carry it over to the result which would be the second digit of the result.\n\n### Input A 50 lb bag of potatoes sits in a 3 foot hole.

{"text": "Answer choice A, B\n\n### Output:The correct answer\n\n\n\n\n### Instructions-Response:\n\n### Instructing The Task:\nTo complete  task you will need to know the difference in their ages,  the age difference between them is 20 years. Hurley is 17 years of age and he is younger than Richard. By looking at the information,  we can determine the age of Richard.\n\n### Solving The Task:\nIf Hurley is 16 years old, what is his age 40 years from know? From the previous step we know that Richard's is 40+years. The combined age cannot fall below zero. In other words the total of Hurley and Richard's age cannot be less than the one that is forty years from now.\n\nHurley's age can be represented as `50-40` where `50` represents the number of years from now and `40` represents his current age. Thus, the number of years  `50-4o` represent Richard's current age. From this information we now know that Richard's age is 50. \n\n### Questions?\n\n### I hope you learnt a lot by this Task\n\nThanks you for your time", "answer": "C: superior"}

I would like to answer your question, but I need more information.\n\nIn [my other post that was 10/1/2020]\n\n```\nResponse:\nIt looks like we need a larger house, but I don't think we can afford it.\n```\n\nIf you want an additional answer, please provide [my other post that mentions what I need to get the answer to the question]\n\n### Input:\"There are currently 4 billion people in the world, the number of people every year is approximately 1% of the population. If the population grows at 1%, what will 100 billion be? How many years?\n\n### Response\nThe input has several problems. The first problem occurs once it has already divided the population, then it wants us to add 1%, then divide by 0.01.\n\nThe input should have been:\n\n```\nInput:The number of people is going up at 1% per year. What will be 100 billion people after 50 years?\n```\nAlso, the output should have been a single number such at \"Approximately 5,000,000,750\" The question is asking you to do math with large numbers, so the output should also include large numbers.\n\nThis is a better way to format what I want.\n```\nInput: How many years and people will it take for the population to double?\n```\n\nYour answer to this is 50 years\n\nThe formula is\n$$2*2.01*2 = 8.01*2$$\n$$2 + 2.01 + 2.02 = 8 + 8.02$$.\n\nSo, a population of 1 person has a total of $2+2.01+2.02=8$,\na population of $2$ persons has a total of $4+2.02+2.04=8+2.02$\n\nAfter $3$ people we have $$4+2.03+2.06=8+10.09$$.\nSo, the general form is: $2*2x2 = 4x(2", "answer": "C: music class"}

{"text": "If a person sees something that they have never seen before, they are often filled with feelings of curiosity.\n\n### Input & Demo:The number of dogs owned at a store is inversely proportional to the number of people employed there. If 20% of the people work there and 10% of them own dogs,what percent of those employees own dogs?\n\n### Response\nI think that 9% of the people who work at the store own dogs. I've seen a similar problem in another section of the HackYeet website with a different way of solving this problem. Therefore, in my solution, I will divide 9 by 11 to determine what percent each group owns.\n\nTo get to the answer of 9%, we need to take the first portion in the division and multiply that by 1. We then take the second portion and multiply it by 9. (9 - 2 - 1) * (18 - 1) = 9\n\n### Input and Demo:A factory owner wishes to hire four workers for a job that can be completed by 3 or 5 workers in three days or five days, respectively. If the owner is willing to hire a worker for a minimum of 3 days at a rate of $60/day, what is the minimum number of days in which the job is to be completed for this rate of pay to break even?\n\n### Input\nI think we can solve this problem through decomposition, which we did in our previous lecture. We know there must be a way to split a project into groups that can be completed by as few people as possible. We don't know, however, how this should be decomposed. We already learned how to split it into groups of 5 people and groups of 3 people. So what groups could we split this project into? If we decompose it into 3 people 3 days and 5 people 5 days, those groups will not be able to complete the job in two days. Therefore, we must split into 3 people 1 day and 5 people 6 days. If it takes 6 days to complete the work and 3 days to complete the work, we must divide 6 by 3.

{"text": "Richard was born, therefore his age is 0. Hurley was born, therefore his own age is 14.\nThe combined age between the two of them is 24.\nWhen they are 24 years from now, the combined age will be 124 - 24 = 100.\nThe difference in ages between them will equal 100, which when dividing into 24 will equal a remainder 16 (24 divisible by 16 will be 16).\nRichard and Hurley are now 24 years old. When they are 40, they will be 64, so combined will equal 128.\n\n### Input(5):\nWhen Richard and Hurley are 40 years old, if all of their children are 14 years old they will be 58 years old...\nAnswer: 173\n\n### Input (6):\nFor each of the above answers is one of the children? Choices: Yes/No\nAnswer: Yes\n\n### Response (1):\nRichard and Hurleys combined age of 128 is the difference between age 20 and age 40 plus their age 40 years ago.\nTheir combined ages from age 24 years ago is 100, by addition 100 years to age 24.\nAdding 64 and 14 to age 24 is 168 = 128. Hurleys was born at age 1, thus his age is 14, Richard's age is 15. Therefore Richard is 16.\nRichard's combined age is then 16 (128 - 100) plus 16 (14+2) = 36+16 = 52.\nRichard' age is then 17 years old.\n\n### Response(2):\nRichard and  Hurleys combined age is 128. They are 64 years old now. 64 divided by 128 = 0,23 (rounded) minus 0,2 =0.17.\nRichards and Hurleys combined ages 40 y ago is 68.\n68 divided by 4", "answer": "B: see light"}

{"text": "I have seen the question on line.\nIt is a tough one but with some analysis I think it is a little easier. The instructions ask for the combined ages 40 from now, or 2060, if you take the 20 plus 2060 equals 2080.\nTaking that as given we just need to know how much younger or older Hurley will be from the start. I took the year now to be 2021 and the present age of Hurley to be 14.\n\nThe question in the instructions say this: \"Hurley is 14\" and we know from above that is now 12 years from the start.  So 12 years from 2021 equals 2033. So his age 2033, which is the present, plus 40 equals 2073, so his age plus his 33 equals 2076.  Richard will then be 2076\n\nThus hurleys age + his present age + 2060 = 2076 + 12 = 2088, so the answer is 2088 + Richeards age = 128, and that was the question, 128.\n\n### Input:\"Rogue\" is the name of the villain in this year's Batman movie.\n\n### Response:\"Insurgent\" is the title of the sequel to the Divergent movie.\n\n## Task: You are creating content for the company store and are in need of an instructional document.

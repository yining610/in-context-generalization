{"text": "### Input\nThroughout the entire process of making this test, we've noticed that certain terms are commonly confused between each other. \nWe've compiled the most commonly-confused words and provided the difference between them.\nPlease keep these in mind when creating your own question.\n<br />\n**Words That Are Confused With Each Other**\n* Complementary versus Supplemental\n\t\n  Complementary is used to describe things that complete each other. An example sentence is, \u201cGrace and her brother are complementary to each other.\u201d\n\n  Supplemental is used to describe adjectives that add onto something else and can be an alternative to synonymous. An example sentence would be, \u201cGrace\u2019s brother can be complementary to her to enhance her look.\u201d\n<br />\n* Complimentary versus Complementary\n\n  Complimentary is used to describe something that is given for free, like a bonus or an extra service that would normally be seen as a charge.\n\n\t\n  Compliment is used to describe admiration or praise. An example sentence would look like, \u201cHope was given a compliment by the President for her actions.\u201d\n<br /> <br />\n* Certain versus Specific\n\n  Specific is used to refer to one individual thing from a collection of items. An example sentence would appear as, \u201cThe dog is specific.\u201d\n\n  Certain is used to describe a general feeling of certainty. An example sentence would like, \u201cDoris is certain that her dog is a good one.\u201d\n<br />\t\n* Effective versus Effectual\n\n  Effective is used to describe as able to do something desired or as good as planned. An example sentence would read, \u201cThe pizza is effective to fill anyone\u2019s hunger.\u201d\n\n  Effectual is the opposite of effective. An example would be, \u201cThe pizza may not seem as effective at making everyone full.\u201d\n<br /> \t\n* Principally versus Principal\n\n  Principally is used to describe something in the most important role. An example sentence would include, \u201cGrace was the principal reason why Boris was excited about his dog.\u201d\n\n  Principal is used to describe someone or something that has priority for receiving the money from a debt or estate.

We need to write a function call before we can run the given code to have it execute into the Expectation function.\n\n```\nFor example: Expectation(\"Ali\")\n```\n\nWill return Ali's average grade.\n\n### Examples:Enter the name of the variables below to calculate the expected value.\n\n### Function Name\nThe function name is Expectation() and expectancts the 3 variables entered to calculate the average grade of the subject: Expectation(\"Lupe\") will return 82.1510826923266\nExpectation(\"Pearls\") will return 67.9664258105508.\nExpectation(\"Amy\") will return 74.0254210487266.\n\nExpectation(\"Angel\") will return 81.76176214207621.\n\n### Note:\nThe Expectation() function is calculated by using a for-loop that iterates through the name of an assignment then returning to the for-loop while going through the other inputs that are expected.\n\n### Example Goal\n```\nGoal: to find out if the name entered (Amy) is within the range of the Expected value.\n\n\n\n### Input\nEnter the name of the variable expected (in our case, Amy).\n\n\n\n## #Expected Value #Results\n\n### Examine the following Result to evaluate how the given code performed through the use of the functions.\n\n### Amy(74) is within the expected range as shown here.", "answer": "D: coastal area"}

The caterpillar is walking with a speed of 2 m/s and the grass is growing with a speed of 5 m/s. How many meters will the caterpillar be walking when the grass has grown 50 cm?\n\n### Inputand Response:A dog and cat walk at speeds of 12cm/ s and 3 m/s respectively. The dog and cat are heading in the same direction. How many meters will it take for the cat to bite the dog in half?\n\n### Note:This type of problem requires a calculation of displacement\n\n### Note2: This type of problem requires a distance and time in order to solve for the displacement. In this case, the dog and the cat have a start, or distance, of 12 meters. The direction or arrow the two animals are heading, gives a constant of 3m/s. So, the animals will travel a distance of 12+12*3=18=6 meters\n\n### Note3: Once you have the displacement, then solve for the amount of time that the dog and cat were actually traveling.\n\n### Note4: Displacement is not the same as distance. Displacement shows the change in location.\n\n### Example:\nLet us define the cat and dog as A (cat) and B (dog), and the x direction as the left side of the plane and y direction as the downward side of the plane. They start at the point A=12+3A, i.e. at the point 12 meters from the origin in the plane, and B=0, that is, at the origin. They are walking in the same direction because the arrow from A to 12 does not change directions.\n\n### Output: A is walking and B is walking with the same starting point at a rate of 12 cm/s and 3m/s respectively.\n\n### Step 1: A is 12 units from the origin, so we place the point at 12,0.\n\n### The next step is to define the speed of both animals in the plane.", "answer": "E: sporting event"}

{"text": "The answer is none of the above. Accidents are not caused just by humans, but can happen naturally to animals, to objects, & even nature itself, so it is incorrect to claim that _accidents_ what _hurt people_. Accidents, in other words, do _not happen to people_, they simply occur to things, whether they are people or not, but are _caused to happen to people_. As an aside, it is also important to note that because accidents can happen naturally, they do occur _anytime_, _everywhere_, & _freakin frequently_ just like anything else, so it is also incorrect to state that accidents occur _only anytime_.\n\n### Instructions: You will type a statement, and then indicate what type of statement it is.\n\n### Types of Statements\nStatements have a purpose and an accuracy of what is being said.

The top of the fences are 6 feet apart and the bottom of the fences are10 feet apart.3. There are 9 sheep in the pasture, but they are not evenly distributed. The leftmost sheep is 8 feet away from the corner and the rightmost sheep is 7 feet away. How many feet does the leftmost sheep have to travel to reach the rightmost sheep.\n\n### Response 1:If the sheep stay on the fence they have to move 90 feet. But if they walk in a straight line they only have to move 50 feet, so they move 40 feet.\n### Response 2:There are 28 feet between the sheep and there are 16 feet between the fences, so there are 44 feet between the sheep and the corner.

How many rings will it take to answer the phone each day?\n\n### Response (Telephone Solution)\n\nThis question asks about rings. Rings are sounds that go from the telephone, through the receiver, and then the doorbell or the phone in general. It then tells us 2 dog ownes the phone. The key, in this question, is to understand how many rings it takes to get someone on the phone. If one dog picks up the phone on the 3rd ring, it takes less than 3 rings for Dylan to answer the phone. So on Thursday, Dylan answers the phone on the first ring. However, Toby answers the phone on the 2nd ring, and he answers the phone the same amount of rings every day. The correct answer is A. \n\n**Note**\n\nIf you have no dogs, only answer the phone after the first ring or you will never go to bed. Otherwise, you will have to pick them up after 24 hours, give the 24 hours they have their rabies shots, and then put the dogs back together. If you have less than 2 dogs, you will have to answer the phone after the dog that picks up the phone does, and put the dog back on the hook and answer it after the same number of rings as the dog that answered it.", "answer": "C: dead"}

{"text": "This question in fact is a complex one. First of all, it is important to know the difference between \u201clawyer\u201d and \u201cattorney\u201d. According to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, a \u201clawyer\u201d refers to anyone who has the license to practice law, and an \u201cattorney\u201d refers to a person who has been trained to provide services to clients on behalf of the law. In my research, I have collected relevant information that would be helpful for the question. It turns out there is more than one type of a lawyer. For instance, the first question was answered with the help of divorce lawyers. The others, however, dealt with general legal practitioners such as tax, corporate and other specialized attorneys. Generally speaking, most divorce lawyers require very little of their time away from their practice and family, and they would spend more time with their wife than with a client. The legal fees associated with divorce are quite large. Therefore, the divorce is a costly task for many people (both partners). After the divorce, the former couple may not enjoy one another\u2019s company. At any rate, what I have learned here is that the divorce cost money and caused the couple to lose their pleasure and fun.\n\n### Input:[Which of the following is not a function of the liver? Choices:  I: excrete hormones and digestive juices II: control blood sugar levels III: filter toxins IV: create vitamin D]\n\n### Response\n\nThis question is not a complicated one. It is important to determine the \u201cnot\u201d in a given sentence. I find the use of semicolon, \u201cnot a function\u201d, and \u201cof\u201d effective in asking a multiple-choice question. According to Merriam-Webster\u2019s Dictionary of English Usage, the word \u2018of\u2019 is a preposition but it takes the form of \u2018has\u2019 or \u2018have\u2019 in this question.\n\nWe know that the liver creates vitamin D. However, it is not among the options. This explains that the options are \u201c(I) excrete hormones\u201d, \u201c(II) control blood sugar levels\u201d, \u201c(III) filter toxins\u201d, and \u201c(IV) create vitamin D\u201d. Thus, it is not necessary to continue answering the question.", "answer": "D: legal fees"}

{"text": "In this task, I found a way to solve the problem:\n\nThe instructions tell us that there are 66 candies altogether. This means that Tapanga has more than Corey, since they have the same amount, but if Tapanga has more, that means that Corey has less.\n```\nTapanga has 44 more than Corey,\n8 more than Tapanga,\n29 more than Corey\n```\nIn the first case, Corey has 29, and in the last case it is the same to subtract 29, so the answer is 44.\n\nThe second set of instructions tells us that Freddy spends a total of 10 dollars. This means, that each call costs 0.50 and 1 min of call can be calculated by dividing the numbers. This means 10/0.5 = 20, so each call costs 20 cents\n```\nThe first call costed 5 cents because the first call was local.\nThe second call costed 25 because it was an international call.\nThe solution is 20+20+8=48 which was the total of Freddy's cost.\n```\nThe third set of instructions tells us to do the same amount of hours each day. If we do so, we will obtain the solution of 5 hours.\n\nThe fourth set of instructions tells us how many books were left in the Room. It means that 600 books were still not sold. This is the answer.\n\nThe fifth set of instructions tells us the amount of money that Michael makes. It states that 100 dollars were spent on the large birdhouses but the medium and the small birdhouses sold each for a dollar more so he received the equivalent of 97 dollars. This is the correct answer.\nThe sixth set of instructions gives us information about how much each of the dogs should receive. The number to the right is the multiplier, which is in this case the percentage, because the 4 would mean that there were 4 dogs. So, Cameron and Boris get 100% and 25% respectively, to receive 38 dogs in total.\n\nThe seventh set of instructions tells us  the amount of cereal in the 3 boxes.

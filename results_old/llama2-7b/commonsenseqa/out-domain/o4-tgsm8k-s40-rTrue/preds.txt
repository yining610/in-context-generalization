He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Rationales: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>#### 54<n>Answer: 54<n><n>Input: Jordan and Perry took a boat out to the lake to go fishing on a Monday morning. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Rationales: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>#### 9<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change? Choices:  A: ignore B: enforce C: authoritarian D: yell at E: avoid<n><n>### Response:		<n>The sanctions were a punishment, but they did not what the efforts the school made to try and change to improve the school's safety.<n><n>### Input<n>#### A: The sanctions against the school seem to suggest that the efforts the school made may still fail.<n>#### B: The sanctions indicate that the school's efforts may still continue.<n>#### C: The sanctions indicate the school made efforts, but they may all fail.<n>#### D: The sanctions are a punishment but they suggest that the school may try and change, or improve themselves later.<n>#### E: The sanctions don't suggest that the school may make efforts.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>A/B: "The sanctions against the the school were a...", this would suggest that the sanctions have done something already.<n>Both the school and the sanctions have done things to try and change, A/B<n><n>C: "The sanctions...", this suggests that there was an attempt by the school to make an effort, and that it isn't over yet, it is continuing on.<n><n>Therefore, C is the best choice.<n><n>### A/B:  The sanctions are not currently enforcing any of the school's efforts, the sanctions are suggesting that perhaps the school will be punished for not carrying out the efforts and not change. They seem to also suggest that they will be punished for attempting to avoid that punishment.<n><n>### Choice E: Ignores everything, or anything after an action.<n><n>### C: The sanctions are pointing to the possibility that the school may still try, or may still have other efforts being made.

This tells us that it is a number. It can therefore also be represented as x*-3.<n><n>##Why:If you multiply a number by -3, one of the digits is a 3, which is negated. When you subtract 1 from a negative number, you only need to subtract the addend. Therefore, x*-3-1 = x*-3+2 = x<n><n>##Why:From the answer choices, A,B,C, and D all correspond to whole numbers. D is less than the other three, and it is not a whole number.<n><n>##Why?: The answer you are thinking of is a negation of the answer for -4 (5*6). If you multiply 5*6, one of the digits will be less than 5, and so the negation must be more than 5, which is an answer choice.<n><n>##Answer: -4<n><n>

Choices:  A: mail box B: suitcase C: front door D: bowl E: post office<n><n>### Response:		A or B.<n><n>### Reason:Answer: A. Letters are sometimes delivered by mail through the mailbox, or by hand through the suitcase, or in a bowl. Only the mailbox and the suitcase can be the answer choices. The mailbox is the most sensible choice because it's a mail-handling device. And in fact, this mailbox doesn't allow only mail to be put in it, but it can also be used to put newspapers in the mailbox.<n>### Reason 1: Hand through the suitcase because some things you can't put in the mailbox, and you can't put it in the bowl either. So, that narrows us down to hand through the suitcase or the bowl.<n>### Reasons 2: Bowls cannot deliver letters, because bowls are round and their curved sides could snag the paper and bend it or tear it.<n>### Reaction:B is the right answer choice. In case you're wondering why a bowl can't deliver letters, it is because the curved sides of it can snag the paper and tear and/or bend it.<n><n>#### 1<n><n>

Choices:  A: cash drawer B: piggy bank C: purse D: box E: pocket<n><n>### Response:		C: purse<n><n>### Demostration:<n>In your answer, A, C, and D are not appropriate because you can't break a cash drawer, a piggy bank or a box easily. You should choose between B and E, since both would lock the money up. However, the choice that is most likely hardest to get out of is a purse. Purse are relatively expensive and have a lot of extra room to throw all of your things that you probably wouldn't need immediately. Therefore, to get the money out of it you'd have to sort through a lot of things.<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>### Input<n><n>C: purse<n><n>

He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Rationales: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>#### 54<n>Answer: 54<n><n>Input: Jordan and Perry took a boat out to the lake to go fishing on a Monday morning. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Rationales: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>#### 9<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:A shop will give you what for your purchases? Choices:  A: downtown area B: container C: ocean floor D: the lost city of atlantis E: high school<n><n>### Response:		The correct is B and A.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>As given that a shop will give you what, you might have thought to ask what for your purchases. But this sentence refers to the location where you could make purchases. The shop will give you what refers to the container you purchase your goods from.<n>In the original sentence, if you make a purchase, then the shop will take away what you purchased.<n>#### 1<n>Answer: 1<n><n>### Input<n>Six years from today, David purchased a truck for. As soon as he made the purchase, he started using it. If he drives 15,000 miles over the life of the truck, how much will that cost him to run the truck over the 6 year period?

The only thing a human can do to feel more alert is to change their behaviors. This can be done by dreaming dreams, thinking critically, crossing the road, drinking coffee, or driving a car. Out of the five options, two can be eliminated because the first is impossible to do and drinking coffee will not help them become more alert. The choice then only needs to be between dreaming dreams and thinking critically. If a human is sleepy they can think more critically.<n>Choice A or B: A means dream dreamers. This is not accurate because dreams is plural, not possessive. Choosing A gives the option that dream is a singular noun. Choice B is the correct choice.<n>Choice A or D: A means dream a dream. This means the human is dreaming, which is incorrect. A means a dream, implying the human is dreaming. This cannot be done, so choice A is wrong. Choice D is the correct choice.

Give an explanation for why this method works with any positive whole number. Choices:  A [D: Add all the prime numbers less than or equal to the number. If the sum of these numbers is divisible by the number, then the number is composite.] B [C: Divide the number by each prime number, and see if any of the resulting numbers are even. If so, then the number is divisible by one of the prime numbers that you divided by.] C [B: Divide the number into the number of digits in the number. If the quotient is even, then the number is a composite number; otherwise the number is prime.] D [A: There are no easy ways to tell if a number is or is not prime.  Except for zero, a number is either prime or composite.  Primes and composites are the only two types of positive whole numbers.]<n>Rationales: Choice A: Add the sum of all the primes, if the sum is divisible by the given number n, it means that number was divisible by one of these prime numbers<n>- 2: 1<n>- 5: 2 + 3<n>- 7: 2 + 5<n>- 11: 2 + 6 + 7<n>- 13: 2 + 7<n>-...<n>So we add up 2 to 100, the sum is 683<n>683 divided by 100 equals 6.83, and 6.83 is not divisible by 100 or any of these prime numbers, because 100, 7,5,4 and 1 are all less than and equal to 6.83<n><n>- Choice B: Divide the number to get a prime, for the number of the digits, in this example is 3. If the quotient of the dividend (100) with the divisor is even (2 * 50 = 100) or uneven (3 * 33 = 100), the number will be a prime or composite number.<n>- Choice C: Divide the number evenly and the results will be even or odd number,

There are no limits to what a player can do in life.<n>```<n>#### C<n>```<n>The gaming is very hard for people right now. There are so many things that we must do to win the game. The hardest thing to do is knowing what to do. That’s why people have to use what they know. This is what is going to happen for the gambler in this case.<n>```<n>#### D<n>```<n>The gamma player decided to come back, but there was still time for everyone else to win. The decision to win helped everyone in this situation.<n>```<n>#### E<n>```<n>It was very expensive to come back to the casino, but the gambling was not expensive at all.

But even if we do not rule out this possibility, what should we expect the probability of Player B winning to be if they started on a winning line. Well Player A would play optimally and Player A started of not on a winning line,

Choices:  A: learning B: fatigue C: mercy D: empathy E: anxiety<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Input<n>What are you hoping to accomplish when listening to an expert speaker?<n><n>- [Choice A: learnt] learning is when a person becomes more educated. In this case, the person expects to go to that meeting and become more educated on the issues that the speaker is discussing.<n>- [Choice B: fatigue] fatigue is tiredness. In this case, a person is likely to become tired because a long meeting has a chance of dragging on for longer than expected. They may feel fatigue after enduring a long session of hearing a speaker talk all of the time.<n>- [Choice C: empathy] empathy is the ability to identify and share the feelings of another person. In this case, if the person is trying to better understand the speaker, they might experience a feeling of what it is like to listen to a speaker. That might feel a little uncomfortable for the person or even unsettling.<n>- [Choice D: mercy] mercy is to have compassion or forgiveness. In this case, it is unlikely that the person going to a meeting of experts would be hoping to get mercy or comfort from a speaker.<n>- [Choice E: anxiety] anxiety is a concern, apprehension, or nervousness. When someone is anxious, it likely means they are not feeling like the speaker is doing the best job of relaying information to them.<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>This question uses ambiguity to give confusing responses. The first three choices all use definitions of learning and all have something to do with the word “feeling.” Fatigue would not likely include the person’s need for a speaker to provide them with emotions, nor empathy. Fatigue would relate to the idea of a longer meeting than expected, which would be unreasonable if the meeting only lasts for a short amount of time. Fatigue includes tired feelings, and this is the answer because learning would not give any of the emotions of these three choices.<n><n>Answer: A<n><n>### InputA: Explain why the following sentence is false in the context of the sentence.  The people who were in the building were all taken.<n><n>### ResponseB<n><n>The people who were trapped in the building can't all be taken.

The product of 5 and 26 is 130. The multiplication expression for 5 and 2 is 5 * 2 = 10.<n>2. The product of 6 and 5 is 30. The multiplication equation that is made for 6 * is 6 * 5 = 30.<n>3. The product of 14 and 5 is 70. We multiply the 1 and the 4 so 14*5=70.<n>4. The product of 4 and 5 is not an expressable product. You cannot multiply in your head or on paper so it would be an incorrect answer. If you put it in a calculator, it will give you a 20.<n>5. The product of 8 and 15 is 120. You multiply the 8 * 15 = 120.<n>6. The product of 7 and 7 is 49. The multiplication equation is 7*7 = 49.<n>7. The product of 2 and 9 is 18. The multiplication equation is simply 2*9.<n>8. the Product of 3 and 15 is not an answer because you can't multiply in your head or draw on paper.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>We chose to start with the first problem because it is the simplest multiplication equation. You just multiply numbers together to get their product. For example you would multiply 26 by 5 to get 130. Next we moved on to answer 2 because we knew the answer would not be a calculable one. Using 6 and 5 would give us 30 and answer 3 gives you the correct answer. The third problem gave us a little bit of a hard time in terms of which number to multiply. We chose 14 because we figured either 14 or 10 could be the answer. In a way it was trial and error but the end answer was right every time. Next we went to seven because at first glance it might seem simpler than the third problem.

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Rationales: Three times the number of Doberman puppies is 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies is 60-5=<<60-5=55>>55<n>Let's say the number of Schnauzers is s.<n>The difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is s-20<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies plus the difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is equal to 90, meaning 55+s-20=90.<n>The number of Schnauzers which is s+55-20=90<n>This evaluates to s+35=90<n>There are s=<<55=55>>55 Schnauzers<n>#### 55<n>Answer: 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Rationales: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>#### 54<n>Answer: 54<n><n>Input: Jordan and Perry took a boat out to the lake to go fishing on a Monday morning. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Rationales: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>#### 9<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:What does reckless driving lead to on a person? Choices:  A: injuries B: fatigue C: traffic jams D: tired E: accidents<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Reckless driving is not a person's name. According to the dictionary, reckless driving means "to drive a car in a way that shows that you do not care about other people or about following the rules and laws."<n>Since reckless driving shows "that you do not care about following the rules and the laws" it does not lead to a positive outcome like "accident", or "injuries". Instead, it leads to another type of consequence, which can be an annoyance like fatigue or a serious problem like accidents or injuries. "Accidents" and "injuries" could be considered a positive outcome, but "accidents" refer to collisions or falls that have already happened. Because "accidents" refers back to something that has already happened, it is more specific than "reckless driving. "Accidents" can be found in the dictionary.<n>"Exhaustion" also refers back to a past occurrence, but it refers back to something that you already put in motion. It can also be described as a result of something else that has already happened. For example, "she was extremely tired because of her late nights."<n>However, "exhaustion" can be found in a different dictionary than the definition of "reckless driving." Therefore, that answer will only appear in tests and tests.<n>In contrast to the definition of "reck less driving," "traffic jams" are a result of reckless driving. It gives a negative result of driving recklessly.<n><n>"Accidents" refers to collisions or falls or incidents already happened. Similarly, "injury" refers to damage to one's body.<n>The word "fatigue" refers to mental or physical exhaustion, which is the result of driving recklessly but it is not one of the possible consequences of driving recklessly, it can be the result of driving reckless as well as from some other activities and events that might happen outside driving.<n><n><n>Answer: D<n><n>### Instructions:In this question, you must answer by providing the correct answer and explanation.

The sentence is about how moving from one place to another is different for each of the words that would be related.<n>I don't know the difference between loose and fast, so I just put fast.

If the person tightens the wheel and it was loose to begin with, nothing will change. I don’t see how tightening a wheel will cause a wheel to fall off when in moving.<n><n>#### F (Fast)<n>A car going fast could have a wheel fall off because it might shake the wheel out in a lot of fast speed.

A winning should be about having fun and not about money. The first one about 'losing money' is nonsense. The other choices make sense.<n><n>### Question<n><n>### Instructions: The questions below have been answered incorrectly. Identify the mistake, state the correct answer, and write a description that explains the difference in reasoning between the two answers.<n><n>### Answer:<n>- Incorrect: 727 and 729 are multiples (3 x 243) of 221.<n>- Correct: 1613 and 1614 are multiples (2 x 807) of 403.<n><n>### Explearation:<n><n>### Choice: I think the reasoning between 3 x 249 and 729 is different. I might be wrong since I cannot see 249 on the calculation. The first one is 727 because 727 x 729 = 52851427 is the same as 249 x 29. The second is 1613 because first one is multiplying it by a number where the units have multiple. And since 1613 is 2 x 806 it is correct since it is multiplied by a unit that has 6 as multiple.<n><n>### Input1: If you have 23 red cards, how many red cards do you have to take away to end up with less than 1/4 left<n><n>### Input2: If you have 19 black cards, how many black cards do you have to remove to end up with less red cards than black cards

Choices:  A: tie shoelace B: rest C: tiredness D: run longer E: sit down<n><n>### Response:		<n>Since the question had a choice, C should be chosen. The wording of the question is that "his running was not going to last long once he trips. It must be that he is not "tired enough to stop running." I.E, he is so tired that he will fall as soon as he trips. He needs to get even more tired, perhaps rest for a bit before continuing. I hope that my explanation is sufficient.

Choices:  A: dictionary B: wilderness C: fly D: underground E: colorado<n><n>### Response:		A: dictionary<n><n>### Why:Either the fly or the colorado can fly. The fly could either be in the fly category,  or be in the colorado category, but not the dictionary category.  The colorado could either be a new species of marmoset, or be a state in which a marmoset would not usually go, but the colorado is not in the dictionary category.<n><n>### Rational:A is the correct answer because it refers to anything not in the dictionary, not the category fly and not the category the colorado. Because there are so many ways to answer the question, the best one gets picked. <n><n>### Input1:  A fly rests on the ground outside one of three houses in a row. The houses are not in a straight line. If the fly flies from house to house and rests on the ground, in how many different ways could she land on the ground outside 2 different houses?<n><n>### Rationale:In each iteration of the loop, the fly flies from the first house to the second house, landing on the ground.  From there she flies to the third house and lands on the ground.  She then goes back to one of the first two houses, landing on the ground in only one iteration.  There are 3 choices for the first house when leaving the loop after flying to all three houses and landing on the ground, meaning that the total number of iterations of the loop is: 2 + 2 + 1 = <<2+2+1=5>>5.  There are 6 possible outcomes when starting from one of the two houses, meaning there are 5 X 6 = <<5X6>>30 possible outcomes when looping from starting in one of the first two housed.  Since the fly rests on the same spot when looping, there are only 2 possible outcomes when starting in the third house, meaning that there are 30+2=<<30+2=32>>32 total possible outcomes when looping.<n><n>### Response2:  B<n><n>### Reason:The house in row 1 is closer to the fly than the house in row 2.  There are 2 possibilities for outcomes when starting in row 1, because of the smaller distance to cover.  Since the house in row 1 has two possible outcomes the total for

Choices:  A: manipulate B: charming C: deceive D: exaggerate E: incompetent<n><n>### Response:		Answer the question based on the given responses.<n><n>### Justification:The only answer choice that is correct under these circumstances is answer option A: manipulate. A real estate agent must use polite and charming words, but a real estate agent must also use trickery. The term manipulate comes from the manipulate verb, which means to "guide by using craft or deceit." The dictionary states that charming means to "impress with the powers of persuasion or kindliness." Exaggeration and incompetent are the other terms that may imply manipulation but don't hold as much weight in this context.<n>[Reference] https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/manipulate<n>[Reference] https[B]://dictionary.cambrid<n>[Reference] https<n>[B] http://dictionary.cambrdige.org<n><n>### Answer: A<n><n>### Input<n>How much does it cost to cover 425 miles on a plane?

Choices:  A: wall B: office C: space shuttle D: front door E: tent<n><n>### Response:		If there are front doors for each corner that's 4. And there are rooms which are space shuttles which we must count and since there are 3 room we divide that by 3 that's less then two. Now the next room are either an office room which is like two or a space shuttle which is four because there are two of them. Since there are more space shuttle then office room so we must add two more to 4 so 6. Now that would make four room and two space shuttles for tent and that leaves us with two more corner which is more corner than spaceship if we don't count the space shuttle in the area of the tent.<n>We must subtract two because there are two room for each tent so each tent have two rooms or space shuttles. So there is more corner that is not spaceship. So which is corner A and corner E.<n><n>Answer: B, then E: front door has 1, then office, which has 2, then tent, which has 2. That leaves 2 which can't be any of the options but A and E, so it's E<n><n>### Input : Is there any country on the map that starts with the letter S?<n>```<n>Answer: No, the only two countries that starts with S are Spain and Sweden.<n>```<n><n>### Input<n>```<n>Input: There are 4 colors of ballons at a party.

She told them the truth so that she could keep an upstanding reputation so that people didn't have to be afraid of her. Mary was worthy of a reward for her honest behavior.<n><n>### Additional Rationale: <n>If I were to guess the question, I would probably say Excellent. But I could be wrong with a 100 % probability, which is why I like the multiple choice questions with more than one choice. Here is why: I took out the word excellent and changed it to worthy. This means she was worthy of a reward, but not excellent.<n>#### 1<n>Answer: The answer should have been "D"<n><n>### Input:{0}<n><n>### Rationales:<n>I am going to choose a number between 1 and 20. Let us say that the integer is 6. Then I would simply add 6 to 6 for the multiplication because 6+6=<<6+6=12>>132. I would subtract the second one from the left to get the difference. After multiplying the positive integer by the non-negative integer, I am going to divide the result by three. I could just say that 6*15/3=<<6*15/2=11>>11. 6 * 5/3 = <<6*5/2=6>>6. Finally, I could say 6 * 4/3 = <<6 * 4/2=3>>3. This is the final result for the multiplication.<n><n>### This answer is incorrect.<n><n>### I am going to choose an integer.

Choices:  A: maps B: street C: catch bus D: city centre E: school<n><n>### Response:		<n>The most convenient place for a bus stop has to do with the routes of the bus lines and how long it takes for people to get where they want to go. In general, the farther away the bus stop is from the city center, and the larger the number of bus lines going out from there, the less costly it is for the city.<n><n>The most convenient places for bus stops are usually located on intersections with other transportation. These intersections with different public transportation are where bus networks meet. <n><n>In particular, a significant advantage of having buses on different routes coming together at these intersections is that it improves the system and the number of people using buses. <n><n>### Demostration:<n>A good place for a bus station is in the heart of town. (E)<n><n>### Rationale: In city centers, many things are nearby, so you can stay there for a long time and go back and forth frequently. This is a great place to wait and make sure you get where you want to go. <n><n>A good place for bus stops is on routes with lots of trips. (D)<n><n>### In a city with many bus lines, traffic jams and buses are common. And having more bus lines can ensure that everyone riding on buses goes where they need to go.<n><n>A good place is where bus routes intersect. (A)<n><n>### The intersection of various bus routes is like a public transport network where many bus routes intersect and where passengers can transfer to another bus without leaving from their original bus. That's how you can find out where you're going. <n><n>A convenient bus stop is one that people want to go to. (C)<n><n>### If it is not in a public place, it will be inconvenient for people to get in and out of the bus. If all public transportation is in another place, it is very inconvenient for passengers to get on and off. So bus stops should be located where people want to be. (C)<n> <n>#### (A)<n>In the city centre, there are many maps, and it is hard to find the destination on these maps and ask other people, which is time-consuming and the destination is far away. <n><n>#### (B)<n>In some schools, the bus stop is often in front of the school gate.

When a person is tired, they feel groggy and discomfort.<n>B. When you are tired, you will typically feel groggy, but if you have been up all night, you may feel very discomfort.<n>C. The physiological effects of staying up the entire night may include tiredness, grogginess, and discomfort. A groggy person who also experiences discomfort will probably need more time to wake up.<n>D. The eyes are one of the most important senses a person needs to wake up. While a person is tired, this sense may become weaker than usual. This is because the brain becomes tired and is not able to produce sufficient chemicals. As a result, a person may feel more comfortable but less alert.<n>E. An important step in starting the day is lifting your arms. While awakening, your joints may be tired and stiff. Therefore, you will be inclined to roll over in order to stretch your joints. During this time, you will also most likely use your hands and feet to move around.<n>### Answer: A<n><n>### Instance 1:<n>Input: Four times Javier earns $9 a day is equal to nine times Joaquin earns $12.

Plastic is also known as polymers. The only material that is not made of plastic is glass. Therefore he prefers glass to plastic. He wishes to be somewhere else. Because he prefers glass to every other material, there is no other material that will suffice. He probably thinks that there is something better or somewhere he would prefer to be. <n><n>### Input - 2:In a city, 2/3 of the buses were broken, and each bus costs $18,000.00 to fix.

One of the premises is true and the other of the premises is a generalization based on observations or experience. The conclusion is a statement in which the two premises are used to prove a point on how they relate to the conclusion.<n>#### Answer:<n><n><n>#### 2<n>What kind of situation is a deductive one?<n>Rationales Deductive arguments are based on formal reasoning in which the conclusion is guaranteed by the premise as a true statement of the logic. There is only one way to reach the conclusion since the premises are true statements. Deductive arguments can either be hypothetical or categorical. When statements are hypothetical, they are stated using if...then format as when "if a, then b." Categorical statements use a formal system of logic known as predicate logic to help explain their statements. Cats are animals.<n>#### Answer: Formal reasoning.<n><n>In a standard modeled argument, the claim is stated to be true or false. Why? Choices: A. It sets the stage for the entire argument, B.

Choices:  A: injury B: death C: playing uno D: coma E: falling down<n><n>### Response:		 Choices: A or B<n><n>### Response Rationale: <n><n>### Input<n>Sky diving scares him. If he loses consciousness, he must have passed out from an injury, which could be a small injury and he can still live, or he may have had a big injury which can be fatal to him. He is still alive because he is writing this. Also he is not dead because if he was we wouldn't know anything.<n>### Response<n>The correct answer is B, since:<n>### The only thing that can cause unconsciousness after jumping of a plane is an injury. Death would be too late for him to be writing the assignment in the hospital. We can only assume that he got hurt and lost consciousness by the time they reached the ground or when he landed on the ground. There’s no other evidence to state what could happen. An injury he may have gotten when parachuting to the ground also may have contributed to him becoming unconscious.<n>### So he wrote this on the ground or was still on the plane.<n> <n> <n> #### Answer choice B<n> <n> #### <n>

In the very first example, Dr. Banks had a total of 330 to give away to patients and gave away 53 in January and after 53, he had 387 to give. In February, he gave away toothbrush 67 and after 67, he had 162 toothbrush remaining. In March, he gave away another 46, he had 116 and in April and May, he give away 52 toothbrush each month. <n><n>According to question instructions, we have to find the difference between these months.<n><n>Now, let's do the same for the second example. In Monday, Sally picks up 30 seashell for the first time and on Tuesday she pick 15 of seashell the same day, but less than before. On way back to shore, it tipped down and they lose 3 of the total collection after that. According to question instructions, we will try to find the difference of the number of seashell left on shore. <n><n>Now, let us try to solve the third example. According to question instructions and scenario, on Monday morning, Jordan and Perry took a a boat to go fishing, Jordan caught 4 fishes and Perri caught eight fishes with a total collection of 12 fishes. On way back, it tipped down, and they lost 3 fishes and now they have 9 left. <n><n>Accoridng to question instructions, we must find which word does not fit in the given statements. <n>```<n>#### Ocean was the correct answer for each of the above questions.<n><n>### 2) Which plausible alternative answers

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Rationales: Three times the number of Doberman puppies is 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies is 60-5=<<60-5=55>>55<n>Let's say the number of Schnauzers is s.<n>The difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is s-20<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies plus the difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is equal to 90, meaning 55+s-20=90.<n>The number of Schnauzers which is s+55-20=90<n>This evaluates to s+35=90<n>There are s=<<55=55>>55 Schnauzers<n>#### 55<n>Answer: 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Rationales: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>#### 54<n>Answer: 54<n><n>Input: Jordan and Perry took a boat out to the lake to go fishing on a Monday morning. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Rationales: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>#### 9<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:Where do kids play with a ball that is concrete?

The storeowner is giving these shoes away one-third of a pair at a time to 5 pairs of customers over 5 weeks. How many customers leave with shoes if every pair is given away during the same week?]<n><n>### Response:[3]<n><n>### ExplaIn:<n>Since there are 15 pairs to give to 5 pairs of shoppers, 3 shoppers get shoes; therefore, there are 12 left at the end. <n><n><n>### Input[Dr. Banks has 590 toothbrushs. A dental charity needs 5/6 as many toothbrushes as Dr. Banks has. How many toothbrushs do Dr. Banks need to keep?]<n><n>## Response:4 [Dr. Banks had 15/6 as many [toothbrushes]] in his inventory as 5/6 is to [6 [toothbrushs]] that he plans to give to the charity. Therefore, he has 15/6 * 5 = <<15/6=2.5>>2.5 toothbrushes left.<n><n>### Explictation:Dr. Banks has an inventory of 590 tootahhbrushes. He's been donating toothbrushed to charity at a rate of 5/6 the number of toothbrushes he has in his inventory. Right now, Dr. Banks is sitting on 4<sup>1/6</sup> as many toothbrashes as he'd need to complete the task. This is represented as 4 <sup>1/6 </sup>* 6=4<sup>5/6</sup>.

Well, if a number does not exist, how can you multiply it to form a sum?<n>### This is an example of what math people call a non-sensical answer. Just because a number is larger than other numbers does not mean that it holds some sort of supreme power; rather, it is just a number. The same would go for something like 3 times a number. You can not say that since a number is a number, that it can be multiplied by a number just because. This is a false statement.<n>### Rationales:If there is no number, there would be no way to measure the product that is formed.<n>### The answer is:<n>`4`

Terrance planned to depart at 5:00pm with two friends, and will then switch drivers with another friend who lives 25 miles away. The group will travel together until they reach their destination.<n><n>### Question<n><n>What time does the group arrive at the Thai restaurant?<n><n>* A. 7:45pm<n>* B. 7:15pm<n>* C. 7:00pm<n>* D. 6:55pm<n>* E. 6:45pm<n><n>### Answer<n><n>Answer - [D](6:55pm)<n><n>The three options that may seem correct are [A] (7:45) and [B] (7:15), but there are some assumptions that must be made regarding the speed of each vehicle based on the question provided. Terrance did not specify if they would all be driving at the same speed or the same vehicle. So this information is not included in the question.<n>Also it is safe to assume that they would not be driving too fast, especially since they are on their scheduled meal time. A logical deduction would be that they would not be rushing at this point to get to their meal.<n>If Terrance is driving the least amount of miles for this trip, it is not certain if they are taking the shortest (less time) and slowest (less miles) route. From my research on traffic patterns this week, you will find that if you're approaching 6:55, there usually tends to be rush hour traffic, which can be quite dangerous.<n>This results in option [D] being the best time for the group to arrive, as [A] and [B] would be rushed, which would be rather dangerous.<n><n>### Rationale<n><n>First there are many unanswered questions to begin with, then there are the obvious inconsistencies between each of the three options. The first thing that should be noted is the fact that Terrance "planned" to leave at the specified time. This is where I began to question what the heck is

Choices:  A: age grieving person B: heart attacks C: depression D: hair loss E: headache<n><n>### Response:		Choose the answer A.<n><n>### Output:Your answer is correct.<n><n>### Explanation:Stress is known to cause or worsen many of the conditions or disorders. When you experience death in the family, the most immediate and devastating result is grief. Other effects that can arise include physical problems and mental health issues. Some of the health conditions that you can develop due to stressful events, include high blood pressure, heart attacks, headaches, depression or other forms of anxiety, as well as changes to your immune system. Heart attacks account for 30 percent of all stress-related deaths; many people with heart conditions die of sudden cardiac arrest. A 2009 study found stress to be a major contributing factor to increased risk of death after a heart attack or stroke. Death in the family can also lead to insomnia, which can itself trigger more stress and depression. When a relationship ends, depression follows. Many studies have shown a link between depression and stressful events. Researchers have also found relationships to stress and substance abuse, as well as suicide attempts. Examples of stress-related substance use can include smoking, drinking, and using medication.<n><n>Death in the family can lead to insomnia and depression, which can trigger more stress, and suicide attempts, according to research.<n><n>#### A<n><n>Answer: A<n><n>### Input<n><n>### Instructions:In the multiplication table below, all values are either 3 or 4.

In addition, the numbers all start at 1. Therefore, no amount of coins can have a fractional part of a nickel.<n><n>Explanation:This means that we don't count the coins as: 1 nickel + 1 nickel + dime. We calculate as: 1 nickels + (dimes ≥ 1)<n><n>### Purpose:To know how much this collection will be if the banker rounded the whole amount to an integer.<n><n>### Rule:The total amount of coins will be (10 * (number of dimes) + (number of quarters) + (number of half dollars)).<n>#### 234755<n>Answer:234756<n><n>### Input (optional):

How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday.

Choices:  A: too much B: act dead C: die D: rush E: explode<n><n>### Response:		<n>C<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>1. When someone falls from a mountain, they usually rush to the nearest hospital or rush to a lower altitude.<n>2. When a mountain is high, the temperature or other factors affect the body so a person might experience confusion and get injured if they try to act like they are normal. So, this question is not accurate.<n>3. When a person falls from a mountain, the person usually dies. But, it's possible that they don't die after falling from a mountain.<n>4. The correct answer is "die".<n>5. The answer could be B too, since, in this case, a body temperature of 100 or higher or low than 80 degrees could affect the body so the person might not act like they are normal and rush to a hospital or a lower altitude. But, choosing B could also mean that the person would "hide" or "camouflage".<n><n>#### C<n>Answer: C<n><n>### Revision:<n><n>1. R: The correct answer in this question is to "die" while falling from a mountain, since, if you fall from a mountain, you might die. But, it'd be hard to give a precise number, since people die from many factors. So, you can just answer that the person would "die"<n>2. V: Since, I don't want to make my answer confusing with "act dead", I'll change the V to "rush to the nearest hospital".<n>3. C: I don't know what "die" means in this question, so I'll choose "rush to the hospital" instead.<n>4. Q: The Rationales are the correct words I got from the question.<n>    If someone falls from a mountain or if they almost die from falling from a mountain, it is probable that their body temperature will become unstable and they will probably rush to a lower or higher altitude and the person wouldn't want to act like they were normal.<n>5. C: If someone falls from a high mountain or from the top of a building, it's very possible that they will die if it has no first aid.<n>

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Rationales: Three times the number of Doberman puppies is 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies is 60-5=<<60-5=55>>55<n>Let's say the number of Schnauzers is s.<n>The difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is s-20<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies plus the difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is equal to 90, meaning 55+s-20=90.<n>The number of Schnauzers which is s+55-20=90<n>This evaluates to s+35=90<n>There are s=<<55=55>>55 Schnauzers<n>#### 55<n>Answer: 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Rationales: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>#### 54<n>Answer: 54<n><n>Input: Jordan and Perry took a boat out to the lake to go fishing on a Monday morning. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Rationales: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>#### 9<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:The man was playfully wrestling with a woman he was enamored with, what was the physiological result? Choices:  A: competition B: blood C: wins D: medals E: erections<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I think 2. (B) is the correct answer since the man was competing with the woman <n><n>Comment: Could you please add your explanation for why you think the answer to the question is B?<n><n>Comment: @Brian That is why he needs to add the explanation he provided.<n><n>Comment: Welcome to S.O! I am very curious to see your explanation. Feel free to share it in the answer box after submitting :)<n><n>Answer: I would have answered D, since if you look at A through C, competition can cause blood, competition can cause winning medals, and competition can cause erections, so it makes sense that competition by itself will cause erections. However, if you look at E, that answers the question of what physiological effect competition with the woman would result in.<n><n>Comment: This is a very creative interpretation of the multiple choice question, so kudos for creativity! However, I do not recommend doing this. It would be better to provide support for your answer by identifying the rationale that justifies your answer choice. The best way to do this is to highlight the evidence provided in each of the choices and show why they do not provide support for your choice. Then present your own line of reasoning and show (using the same evidence from each of the choices) why your reasoning supports your choice.

He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Rationales: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>#### 54<n>Answer: 54<n><n>Input: Jordan and Perry took a boat out to the lake to go fishing on a Monday morning. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Rationales: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>#### 9<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:What do people who are speech therapists do?

What does Math therapy help people with?  Choices:  A. Make music B. Believe in God C. Give Speeches D. Complete sentences E. Build houses<n><n>### Demostration: C<n><n>### Process:<n>I see that both questions have the same options and format.<n><n>### Logic:<n>The answer is C in both questions, which is in the form of math therapy<n>### Rationale:C: Give Speeches<n><n>### Process 2:Jeremy is a doctor. What do doctors do?  Choices: A. make music B. believe in god C. give speeches D. complete sentences E. build houses<n><n>## Input: Jeremy is a doctor.  What do doctors do ?  Choices: A: make music B. believe   in god C: give  speeches D. complete C sentences E. build  houses<n><n>##Response: Make music<n><n>##Logic: <n>Jeremy is a Doctor.  <n>To be a doctor you need to give speeches, complete sentences, and build houses. <n>All of these are possible but the only one mentioned in the question is Make music. <n>Doctor has the same amount of capital letters as Music, which I think means that it is the answer. The word music is capitalized but give and complete are not, I also find it suspicious that no other profession gets mentioned, although both speeches and sentences are mentioned.<n><n>##Rationale:Speeches:<n>Since Jeremy is a doctor he must make speeches. A doctor has to give speeches so he can give medical advise to patients.<n>"What do doctors do?" is a question that could possibly be asked to  someone who is a doctor. <n>

He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday.

Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Rationales: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>#### 9<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:The sun was out and the temperature changing rapidly, it was really beginning to what?

How many pencils are left in her pencil?<n><n>### Dem : What is a fair number of pencils are given to her neighbor and how many are left.<n><n>### Solution : She is able to lend her neighbor 4 pencils.<n><n>### Rationales :<n><n>#### 4<n>Answer: 4<n><n>### Input<n><n>A man is on a journey for 99 yards. He walks 1/4 of a mile further than the other half of the journey. What is the distance he has walked when he reaches his destination?<n><n>### Solution<n><n>There are 2 ways to solve this<n>    1. To get a solution we need to look at the second condition which is "he walks 1/2 a mile". Since the journey is 99 yards, 1/2 of mile means 49 yards. So, the rest of the journey is 50 yards. Then the total is 99+50 = 149 yards.<n>    2. The man walks more than the other half of journey. So, the solution is : 99 + 1/2<n>    3. Now after 99 +1/2 we have 148 + 1/4<n>    4. Finally 148 +1/4 is equal to 125

Write down a complete sentence<n><n>### Write a sentence that responds to the following problems.<n><n>### The number of times a word (or phrase) in a book is repeated is its frequency, or frequency of appearance. One can use this frequency to calculate what is called the "average frequency," that is, the average number of times the word (or phrase) appears in the whole book. For example, you might count the number of instances where the word "cat" appears in the book A Tale of Two Cities. By this metric, "cat" appears an average of 3.91 times in the entire book.<n>A mathematician named David Eugene Smith calculated the average frequency of all the words in the world's most common languages. He found that the average frequency for English was 113.41 instances, 250.4 for French, 280.4 for Spanish, and 418.6 for Italian as of 2002. In more recent research, another statistician, Alan E. Lewis, has calculated that the world's most frequently used word, "the," has a frequency of 53,392.

Choices:  A: speak freely B: happiness of a child C: care for children D: school child E: control children<n><n>### Response:		A.  <n>### Reason/Justification: Parents have the initial duty of responsibility to their children, so that they do not experience any sort of harm or deprivation. In the sense that the parent is the one that must do their very best in order to not only provide the necessary things for the child to survive, but also to nurture them. The parents responsibility does not end at providing for the child, but also to keep them safe from people who may wish harm on them, make sure that the child is happy with the best he/she can have; also the parents must make sure the child is obedient to the laws of society and most important they should always keep tabs on the child.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><i>Choices:</i><n><i>A:</i> Parents have the primary duty, responsibility, and role, to secure and secure the child in every possible way, including all facets of the child's existence, and in all their actions, such as: ensuring that the child is happy, healthy and happy and as safe as possible, that he/she is cared for, attended to, and looked after as much as possible, among other things.  <n>The parents' role, responsibility and duty is paramount.<n><i>B:</i> Happiness of child comes second the parents's role and responsibility to take care of the child and ensure that it grows up in a safe and secure environment, to the best of their ability.  This responsibility includes being responsible for the health and happiness of that same child and looking after that child and making it as safe and secure as possible.<n><i>C:</i> Care for children comes second to the parents' role and responsibility to look after and care for the child so that it can become healthy and be able to cope with itself in all the future.  This role and responsibility,  however,  requires the parents to also take care of the child in all other facets of his/her life and to always try to make this child's life as safe and secure as he can.  And with this in mind, parents also have a duty to teach their children the rules and laws of the society they live in.  <n>If this task comes first, then the responsibility of caring for a child would only be secondary; and then the child's life would be up

I suppose that that would be the correct answer?<n>Answer: There is no choice A for necessity.<n><n>##### I think it is fair to claim that there is a strong connection between A, C, and D because if A and C aren't considered love and inspiration, respectively, what word besides "necessity" do you pair with "engage"?<n>Answer: You're right. <n>We can say that there's a strong connection between the letters A, C, and, in fact, D<n><n>##### I guess choice E is out because "fun" has no connection to any other words. But what kind of connection do A, C, and B have to one another? I can't come up with anything.<n>Answer: Well, let's take a look at each answer in a way to see the connection better...<n>A: Necessity.<n><n>C: Is something that's very close to love.<n><n>D: Is something that'll motivate you.<n><n>E: Is something that is just a "fun" activity<n><n>##### A and D have something in common, but C and E don't.<n>Answer: I think we can say that that there is a connection among the letters A, C and, in fact, E, but we can't say there's a connection between C and D. Can you give one connection?<n><n>##### I'm not sure what kind of connection you would make between A and D. Are A and D close for some reason or are they more like opposing extremes?<n>Answer: I guess maybe A and D are two poles in their own way, but for A, it's more like... a "necessity" to keep being friends... In my opinion, that's the reason why people engage themselves with friends on social media, for example. <n>##### I suppose we can say that D and E have a polar connection, but that leaves us with no connection between B and C. So the only connection within the choices is B, C, D. Is it because these things don't have an essential connection, we have

This means that those studies are similar in design and therefore might provide the same type of evidence.<n>In response to this rationale, consider the following:<n><n>The study was a double-blind placebo study that involved 50 patients and was conducted over the course of three months. During the study, many of these patients were given medicine as prescribed by their physicians. Because the study included only patients who already had a prescription for medicine, it does not establish cause-and-effect between the placebo and the positive results. Hence, there is a difference in design between the study and the passage; the study's design is different from the passage's description of the design of the study described in the passage.<n><n>### Input<n>The evidence presented in the passage about the study of the placebo effect is different from the evidence provided in the passage about the effect of prescribed medication in relieving patients of their sleeping problems.<n><n>### Response<n>Answer the following question.<n><n>> 👤👤<n>### Instruction:Select the piece of information that would be needed to fill in the blank at the beginning of the last paragraph.<n><n>## Instruction:Use reasoning to infer the information needed from the passage.

This study found that patients with sleeping problems who get regular sleep and are less anxious, who use their own pillows and bedding and who have more room to move, ____________. This evidence is needed because the evidence provided in the last two paragraphs is insufficient to support the claim being made. The last two paragraphs indicate that _________, is causing some patients to become less anxious about going to sleep. This finding does not provide sufficient evidence that _________

If 15,000 school principals are black and 450,000 are white in the United States, how many elementary school principals are black? How many more are there than high school principals?<n><n>### Demystified:<n>To understand this type of problem, we first need to understand the data set. We know that 10 percent of principals are black, and we find out that "10% of 15,050 = <<10%15050  = 1,505>>1,505" black principals are there. We also know that 450,500 are white, and we find out "82% of 450, 500 =  <<82%450500 = 368,010>>368,001 white principals are there." We also know that, generally, elementary school principals are more prominent than their counterparts at the lower schools. Thus, we can determine that a majority of black principals are principals of "elementary schools." This is because these are the principals of schools that 1. have children in the "elementary school" age group, and 2. are the best-known schools for young students to experience before they hit middle school. As a result, we can see that the amount of "black" principals at elementary schools is 15050 + <<10%1.505*368,0583=4,183>>4,184.<n><n>We also know from the given information that there are "82% of total principals = 82% 450,368  = 372,603>>372,693 white principals" total at all other schools. We thus know that "10%-80% = <<10%-82% =12%>>1

Counting to the end of one year and noting the correct day of a day in its year.<n>2. Using a rule that is given for the current moment to determine the answer.<n>3. Using a table to determine the answer. (which you obviously don't do in the answer space...)<n><n>If you select A or B, the correct answer cannot be a multiple of _____, where _____ is the number you got wrong.<n>That is, if you select A, then the correct choice cannot be B.  The correct choice cannot be multiple of 5.  Therefore, the correct choice must be C.<n><n>If you select C or D, the correct answer cannot have the same units as the choice you got wrong.  That is, if you select C, the answer has to be in units of days, which means the answer could not begin with a numeral like "1,078", which is a number of months.  Therefore, the answer will be in units of days.  Therefore, D must be incorrect.<n><n>If you selected D, the correct answer must be E.<n><n>If you chose E, the answer will be 20.<n><n>#### 1<n>Answer: 20<n><n>### Input Three: In the U.S., there are four numbered

Choices:  A: relaxation B: exhaustion C: energetic D: become stronger E: use energy<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Solution: A) Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>### Answer: D<n>The letter response is a statement of what happens when we exercise. We become stronger. This is correct because we get stronger after we exercise. We also become more energetic which is not what we want.<n><n>### Input<n><n>```<n>What does exercising lead to? Choices A: relaxation<n><n>B: exhaustion C: energy D: become stronger E<n><n>fuse use energy<n>```<n><n>### Answer to input<n>The correct answer should be E because if we exhaust ourselves during an exercise session, we will not have any energy to spare to use any energy to our workouts later. We will also be very tired so that we can not relax.<n><n>### Comments<n><n>- A and B are incorrect because they don't address our question because they don't explain why we're doing the exercise in the first place. We're not trying to relax or exhaust ourselves. That's not good enough. We're trying to use our energy.<n>- The answer D, Become stronger is not the correct answer because it doesn't answer the question. It's vague and confusing. It's not clear what they are saying or what the relationship between the question being asked, and the answer being provided. For example, "what does exercising lead<n>- to" is not the same thing as "become stronger." The two are different in scope and meaning.<n>- The answer E, "use energy" is also incorrect because the question being asked doesn't describe energy being used during exercising. The answer should address the question being asked about exercising immediately lead<n>- to. The answer "use energy" doesn't address exercising immediately lead from one place to another, but, instead, it's vague enough that it could be interpreted in any meaningful or unmeaningful way. The answer is not correct because it's lacking detail<n><n>

You have a fever and may be sick. Dr. Vance knows that you are generally healthy, so he asks you if your BP at home is lower than it is at the doctor's office, and if it's typically lower than what you have at the doctor's,  do you want 175/95 or 115/80 at the doctor's?<n>Rationales (from Dr. Vance): Your home BP is normally 120/80, but today after a long day at work your BP is actually 150/90. This means your BP is higher than usual at home which could be because of having an increased level of stress.

Therefore, choice(s) D seems to be the obvious choice because <n><n>### Answer:<n>From reading choices, <n>If you're exhausted, you'll need to recover from exhaustion by resting/going to sleep/staying in bed<n>R:S:P:A choice should be to stay in bed because all of your options makes no sense, and there is nothing better than rest.<n><n>### Rationale:The second part of the task requires me to state which response I would prefer.<n><n>### Answer<n>Response B makes no sense because it's not reasonable to expect you to run or meditate after you have just exerted some energy in running 100yd. There is just no point because you have already exerted effort in trying to run 100yd but had no time to even get to the first 50yd. It is unlikely that you are going to run for 1mile. You might as well take a nap instead. The second part of the task is the easiest one to do.<n>

Choices:  A: alabama B: tennessee C: violin case D: music store E: bow and strings<n><n>### Response:		A: alabama<n><n>### Input<n>A few months ago, Diana made a bargain. If she made 100 chocolate chip cookies in 10 minutes and 02 seconds or less, she would get a free dessert. If she didn't, she would pay $1.35 for an apple turnover. Diana wanted desperately to get the free dessert. Last week, she finally made it when she made 103 cookies in 8 minutes and 07 seconds. What was the cost of the apple turnover that she didn't get?<n>#### 0.7<n>Answer: 0.7<n><n>### Instructions<n>In the previous multiple choice question, we are given the scenario of Diana’s desire to get a free dessert by making 100 cookies in 100 seconds or less. If she makes 100 in less than 10 minutes, she will get a free dessert if she doesnt make more than 100. But if she gets 100 or more in 100.00 or less, she will have to pay 0.75 cents for a dessert.<n><n>This means that if she can make 102 or more in less than 12 minutes, she will get the free dessert, and if she can make 90 in more than 14 minutes, she will have to be charged the 1, but no more than 1, 35 for a dessert. Now consider the cost of a given number of dessert tickets based on how many cookies she has to make in 10 minutes or less to get them.<n><n>For example, if she has to make 5 in 10 minutes, each dessert is 0.75. If she has to make 10 in 10 minutes then each dessert is 1.00. If she can make 32 in 10 minutes each dessert is 2.00. And so on.<n>We have two linear systems of equations from this: One with 10, 20, 30, 40, and so on based on how many cookies in 10min or less is the cost of a dessert, the other with 10,40, etc that shows how many

Choices:  A: economic instability B: not noticeable C: spend more D: rising interest rates E: boring<n><n>### Response:		D.<n><n>### Input:(1)The United States Congress has been working toward balancing the federal budget since it was established in 1789, but Congress has not done so for 49 straight years. The 2002 federal budget is the closest of $178 billion, which is a mere 0.41 percentage of the gross domestic product. (2)Despite our best efforts, in 1968 inflation stood at an average of 5.1% for the year and 2.4% in 1977. There is no question that inflation has hit this country's economy during the past 30 years, and this may be the reason that interest rates are now at record highs.<n><n>### Rationales:1. The federal government has balanced the budget before, but even when they got close, they didn't get to - 0.41, but that is just this year. So, they haven't balanced the budget in 49 years<n><n>### 2. Inflation has been so bad, that the best way of dealing with it is to increase the interest rates, which they have done.<n>#### 2.4%<n>Answer: 2.4%

Choices:  A: hair salon B: hair of woman C: barber shop D: pincushion E: woman's hair<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Demand:<n>Your response should be one of the options.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>The only choices that really make sense in this choice are A, B and C.<n>An options A: hair salon is a good choice, since the word'salon' is commonly used to describe the work area of a hair dresser.<n>Options B: hair of woman can work in this choice, since 'hair' is the object of the preposition 'of' and the subject in this sentence is the word 'work', meaning 'workplace'.<n>Options C: barber shop is also a good choice, since 'barber shop' is a place to get a hair cut or a haircut. If you use the word barber, then the place 'barber shop' means that place where you go and get a hair cut.<n><n>### Option D: pincushions is not a good choice because no matter how many times you say that 'pincushions' is a place to store your pins, it is not. There is another option called 'pin cushions'. 'pin cushions' is a noun in common English that is not the correct option to choose, since it does not make sense whatsoever.<n><n>Option E: woman's head is also not a good choice because it means literally 'the head of a woman' and if you look at the options there is only one choice of an 'object'. A 'head' is the object and is a different meaning to the preposition that goes with the choice of 'of'.<n><n>### Choice B: hair of woman<n><n>The choice C: barber shop has no preposition that matches with the object 'hair' in this sentence. It would look better if the choice was C: a hair cut from a barber and not a barber shop. <n><n>### Choices A, B and C:<n>The best answers are A: hair salon, B: hair of woman and C: barber shop.  <n><n>### Choose B: hair of woman,  since hairstylists cut hair, and it looks right. <n><n>## Question:I have one pair of socks.

He didn't want any meat for it.  Where might Simon be taking the cow? Choices:  A: countryside B: city C: dairy farm D: butcher shop E: canada<n><n>### Response:		Option D<n><n>### Rationales:Simon didn't want to kill the cow, so that means he would sell it as meat. BUT, he also didn't want any milk, so we can rule out C & D. He didn't say he was moving to Canada, so E is out too. That means, if he wasn't taking the cow any place that he might benefit from selling the cow or parts of the cow, then Simon would probably just be putting the cow on a dairy farm where they milk cows. This doesn't benefit Simon, so C would go away. <n>

Choices:  A: idaho B: shopping mall C: big city D: in town E: new york<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Rationale: The answer does not have to be 'D', it should be the option which will lead to increasing number of potential customers. From the above graph, the largest density is at E (New York) and the smallest density is at B(shopping mall). Now, you have to choose an option which has got a density less than or equal to A(Idaho), but which still can be considered as increasing the numbers of potential customers. A(Idaho) is the one which you would be comparing each option to and you will see that B has a greater density than A. Now you have to choose an element which will increase the number of potential customers. Since shopping mall doesn't fit the criteria, you have to go for B(shopping centre). Since D(in town) has a greater density than B(shopping center), D(in town) is not a valid option to choose.<n><n>C(big city) is a valid option, but it will decrease the density so it is not a valid option.<n><n>E(New York) will increase the density, so it is a valid option. Since A(Idaho) has a greater density, you can choose E(New York) which, because it increases potential customers more than any other option, is the best one to choose.<n><n>#### E<n>Answer: E<n>### Input:The maximum distance is the number of possible unique trips from one point to multiple points in the graph.

These aren't the only reasons to get into a state of competition, but these are the main idea behind this scenario."<n>  > "Whenever you compete with anyone, they will always get into a competitive mindstate.

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Rationales: Three times the number of Doberman puppies is 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies is 60-5=<<60-5=55>>55<n>Let's say the number of Schnauzers is s.<n>The difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is s-20<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies plus the difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is equal to 90, meaning 55+s-20=90.<n>The number of Schnauzers which is s+55-20=90<n>This evaluates to s+35=90<n>There are s=<<55=55>>55 Schnauzers<n>#### 55<n>Answer: 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Rationales: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>#### 54<n>Answer: 54<n><n>Input: Jordan and Perry took a boat out to the lake to go fishing on a Monday morning. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Rationales: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>#### 9<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:Where is a paper notice likely to be left on a house? Choices:  A: front door B: conference C: classroom D: refrigerator E: suitcase<n><n>### Response:		<n>If I were leaving a paper notice on a house, I would not use E because it does not make sense, E is leaving a paper notice in a suitcase.<n>I would probably put it on the refrigerator, that way I know what I am eating for dinner!<n><n>### Input<n>A student at a middle school needs to complete 50 pages of homework by the next day. If he can complete 6 pages per hour, then a new student at that school has a homework assignment of 20 pages. If that student can complete 3 pages per hour, then 12 pages are still remaining undone. How many pages does the first student have left undone?<n>Rationales You can multiply 4 by 5 for 20, and multiply 3 by 10 for 12. The difference is 12 pages. 600 ÷ 12 = <<600/12=50>>50 pages left undone.<n>Answer: 50<n><n>### Input The population of city A will be growing steadily. If 35% of the citizens of that city take a short trip to city B every year, and the remaining citizens take a trip to city C every other year, what percentage of the citizens of city A will not take a short trip?<n>Rationales To get the answer, you need to know how many trips the citizens of city A are taking every year in total. For every 3 citizens, 2 of them would go to city B every year. That leaves 1 to go every other year to city C. The remaining citizens are only taking a trip every other year, 2 every other years = 1 year -> 3/2 = <<3/2=1.5>>1.5 so if 29.5% went to city B, 1.5% of the citizens went to city c. 1.5 / 100 * 100 = <<1.5/100=1.5>>, 29.5%.<n>Answer: 29.5<n><n>### Input Five times the number of marbles times the number of marble bags was equal to 70.

Choices:  A: asia B: southern hemisphere C: planet D: east E: earth<n><n>### Response:		C, Planet.<n>### Demon:<n>The question asks where a Martian would find the Indian Ocean. You should choose the answer that describes where a Martian would not find the Indian Ocean. This is an example of a question that requires you to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant details in a given question.<n><n>## Response Evaluation<n>1. If you choose **choice D** as the correct answer, you did not answer the question as it was asked. You chose the correct choice on the previous problem, but in the one problem, you answered the question as it was not worded.<n>2. If you chose **choice B,** then you may have been influenced by the first word in the answer – Southern Hemisphere. For example, you might have assumed that the Martians have maps that are labeled by the names of lands (as that is how we humans label things). However, since the question said in order to find the Indian Ocean, the Martian would use his map, the map would not be labeled in any way. Therefore, the Martian would find the planet on its map by referring to a coordinate system such as longitude and latitude. (A coordinate system is a set of numbers used to find a location on the surface of the Earth. More specifically, the number lines in a coordinate system provide you with a way of measuring, for example, length and direction. The two measurements (one for each direction) together make the coordinates for a place on the Earth’s surface.) In any case, the question was asking to select where the Martian would not find any evidence of the Indian Ocean. This way of finding the Indian Ocean is more logical.<n><n>## 3.

She sits down to play a game of cards with the rest of her family, each of whom has one dog at most. The dog owner sits at a different table from each of her children and her husband. How many different seating arrangements are possible?<n>Rationales :The dog owner has six total dogs and one of the dogs is black. Each member of her family also either has one or no dogs.<n>If each member of her family has a dog, one dog must be black. For example, if the family does not consider the black dog, they will have one dog left which must be nonblack.<n>Because there are only five dogs, the black dog must sit at a different table from the rest. Since the dog owner can sit with each family member other than the family member who owns a dog, the black dog can either sit with the dog-owning family member or with the dogless family member.<n>If the dog owner does not sit with the dog owner, there are four unique seating arrangements.<n>####

Choices:  A: hurry along B: direct traffic C: help D: force open door E: corner thief<n><n>### Response:		 B<n><n>### Input(Correct):You and your friend are talking about the movie, the new Avengers film. You tell your friend that you thought it was a great movie. They then tell you that they thought it was ok, but that it had a few too many explosions and shootouts for their liking. You agree with them and decide that the whole movie could have been filmed more quietly.<n><n>### Input (Not correct):You and your friend talk about the Avengers film when it first came out. You say you thought the film was good. You and your friend agree that the movie had some great actors, though there was one actor who wasn’t very good and the movie has a ton of explosions which ruined the experience.<n><n>### Rationales: Choice D doesn’t match any of the words in the sentence exactly. Choice C could be correct in another sentence, since it means “being forced”. Choice E means that they had to force the door open, but that can’t mean they forced “open” which is already in the sentence to begin with.<n><n>Choice A: hurry along<n>Rationales: “Hurry along” means to move faster for the group. Since there is already a group in the sentence, “hurry” wouldn’t make much sense to add. It would make us move faster as a group to move slower (since “slow” is in the sentence).<n><n>Choice B: direct traffic<n>Rationales: Choice B is the correct answer choice because it means to manage and decide the direction of the traffic. There is traffic because there is a “scene of the accident”, so the policemen “direct” the traffic by telling what direction everyone should go in.<n><n>Choice C: help<n>Rationales: There is no way that “help” means anything in this sentence; “help” would mean that they were helping the police with their work, but since the police needed to direct the traffic, the policemen wouldn’t need to help each other “direct traffic”. Choice B is the better choice since the policemen tell the traffic where to go.<n><n>Choice E: corner thief (wrong)<n>Rationales: It could mean that they put the thief in the corner since the policemen were trying to get the thief back in the back seat where they put him after they stopped him, but that

Choices:  A: vegetables B: market C: doctor D: train station E: bookstore<n><n>### Response:		The answer is A which is vegetables.<n><n>### Rationale: The first sentence of the question says it is an advertisement for a vegetable market. The answer says you are waiting for a vehicle. That implies it’s likely to be on rails. Rail stations usually have vendors and/or vegetables, as well as magazines. There no other reasonable possibility.<n>This is a multiple choice question.<n>---<n><n>### Demofrat-input: You just walked through a door that is a foot taller then the door you were just in. The space in-between the two doors is 1 ft. You are on the 1st floor. You decide to stand on the floor you started on, rather then sliding through the door into the new floor. You go backwards until you feel the floor go from 1 ft tall to 2 ft tall. Once this happens, how many inches did you slide? You can only slide forwards and backwards. You can’t stop.<n><n>---<n><n>#### Rationale: <n><n>Say we started at the point (x,1) (x>0). We will work in the negative x direction.<n><n>Suppose x=-1. Then the door is 1 ft away. But we only started on the floor 1 ft tall.<n>If we slide into the door, our feet hit the new door as x=0. Our feet are at the new floor, so (x,y)=(-1,0). Or we slide down 2 ft.<n><n>Or we can slide 1 ft, into the door's 2 ft. Then we are on the new floor, but we have moved 1 ft upward in the negative x direction from (-1,-1) to (-1,-2).<n>So going in to the door, we slide 2 ft. Coming out, we slide 1 ft. We slide -1 ft from x=-1 to x=-2.<n><n>Now, we can use the equation x=-(y)(2/3)-1 to work backwards. This can be done for all x in (0,-1). In each case, it is a shift of the plane by (-2/3,0) for every step, so we end at (0,-1).<n>So we slide -2 ft.<n><n>#### 2 ft<n><n>Now we can see we can do this process for all other

Choices:  A: empowering B: regret C: despair D: glee E: sadness<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Reason: Empowerment is a concept which can lead to positive change in one's behavior and emotions, which might lead to better results in future, or perhaps, a better way to live life. However, by hurting others, one won't feel empowered (C). It feels more like despair as one might feel remorse and regret for what one did that might have caused someone harm (D). As for the other three options, they are less likely than despair to be how one might feel after hurting someone by accident. After all, if one accidentally hurts someone, one would regret it, and that should make one feel glee as it could be used as motivation for the future, and not sadness. Thus, B and A are ruled out as unlikely feelings that one might feel after accidental harm (C).<n><n>### Response 2:In how many ways can two people sit down in a room if there are 3 chairs?<n>1.

The largest number remaining with a ten to the left is 28. What is the larger number?<n><n>### ResponseA number is removed from the greater multiple, is divided into the lower multiple, and from there a number equal to the difference between the lower and the larger one is selected.<n><n>### RationalesBecause a number is removed from a greater multiple and divided into a smaller one and to the sum ten, we will do as explained in the task and divide the number of the smaller multiple by ten, leaving the number at the ten and then subtract the number from the number of the smaller one, leaving the number greater than 10 and will subtract this number from the number that has a difference of ten with the number of the larger one.<n><n>### So we will begin by subtracting the number of the smaller the larger one (15 - a number) to obtain the number with respect to which we will subtract ten. Let's write the result.<n><n>### As a result of subtract the number of the smaller for the larger number, the number will be as follows:<n><n>### Next, we will subtract a smaller number from the larger one, leaving the number of the larger, and ten to the left of it to find the new answer.<n><n>### We shall divide the number obtained in that way

Choices:  A: leg B: garment C: torso D: body E: road<n><n>### Response:		The correct response is C.<n><n>### Response rationale:For this question, you must look to the beginning of the passage. The narrator says that he "curled up" to minimize the impact. He then explains that he "tried to fall on his shoulder." He "tried" suggests that it was a conscious decision with the intention of minimizing some type of harm. However, he is unable to achieve his goal. This suggests the presence of an obstacle, or an object in the environment that prevented him from falling. He "tried" to fall on his shoulder while "what" must be an indirect object pronoun that directly follows the verb "try." Given that this sentence directly follows the previous, its referent is likely to be the "arm or what" that was previously mentioned. However, to minimize the impact of the fall on his shoulder, one must "fall" onto the body. An impact on the shoulder will be less severe than an impact on the arm. This would then cause an impact on the body for the narrator, causing the narrator to fall onto the road, the last in the list of acceptable responses. "Body" is then the only choice that would have required the narrator to fall from his position onto the road.<n><n>The possible values of the variable are D, E, A, B, and C. The correct choice is C (body).<n>#### C<n>Answer: C<n><n>### Input : A man was traveling by train. The ticket said that the ticket was half empty or half full. It did not say that the ticket was half full. What does that mean? Choices: 	A: The train was fully empty. 		B: The train was fully full. 	C: The train was half empty. 		D: The train was half full. 		E: The train was completely empty<n><n>### Response : The correct response is D.<n><n>### Explanation : For this question, you must consider your knowledge of trains and the meaning of "half empty" or "half empty". You must further consider the phrasing of the question, "The ticket said that the ticket ___?_." In answering this question, you must identify that there is an important phrase missing in the second part of the question.<n>Consider for example the phrase "half empty / half full' in the context of a glass. Say if

She had started learning to play the violin last September, and decided to add the guitar to her repertoire after discovering a guitar in her grandparent’s basement that her grandmother had bought for his son 60 years before. The girl had started playing the violin because her parents had been playing violins together since their university days, and she wanted to learn an instrument too. She has been practicing the guitar and the violin for one hour each every day since last Sunday. She practices the violin on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays, and plays the guitar on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. She also practices the guitar an hour every other day because she thinks that it is easier to learn to play both instruments at the same time.<n><n>##### Q1:  How many more hours has she practiced the violin over the week compared to the guitar?<n><n>##### Q2:  How many more days did she spend practicing the violin than playing the guitar?<n><n>---<n>##Q1:  How many hours has she practiced more on guitar compared to the violin? ###Answer: 3<n><n>---<n>## Q2:  How did she spend more time than the guitar? ###Answer: practicing the violin.

He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Rationales: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>#### 54<n>Answer: 54<n><n>Input: Jordan and Perry took a boat out to the lake to go fishing on a Monday morning. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Rationales: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>#### 9<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:What animal produces milk?

Pigs produce pork by eating plants.<n>C: Cows usually produce milk. Cows eat grass.<n>D: Refrigerators do not produce milk; they are used to store perishables. They are used to store milk and ice cream.<n>E: Store is not a valid answer; it is a noun that denotes a physical place. It is used as a verb in the following sentence: “The students store their lunches in the lunchroom.”<n><n>### Rationales:<n>There is only one answer that is logically valid: cow. Cows produce milk. Thus, the correct answer must be cow.<n>#### Cow<n>Answer: Cow<n><n>### Input and Output(IO)<n>Input: What is one of your favorite activities? Choices: A: Eating B: swimming C: climbing D: exercising E: gardening<n><n>Output: Eating is my favorite activity.<n><n>### Rationale:Eating is my favorite activity because I enjoy cooking for my friends and having dinner parties.

If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Rationales: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>#### 54<n>Answer: 54<n><n>Input: Jordan and Perry took a boat out to the lake to go fishing on a Monday morning. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Rationales: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>#### 9<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:What is the opposite of foolhardy? Choices:  A: thoughtful B: discreet C: calculated D: cautious E: careful<n><n>### Response:		<n>B<n><n>### Rationales:<n>B is the appropriate response. "Discreet" means "not open or frank". To the contrary, "foolhardy" means "fearless, rash, or careless".<n>The only opposite words which meaning is not relevant are "careful" (meaning "marked by or showing thoughtful concern for avoiding mistakes", though there are other meanings, such as "having or showing a considerate or respectful attitude toward people") and "cautious" (meaning "causing anxiety; giving rise to or showing concern, fear or apprehension", though there are other valid meanings, including "marked by or characterized by careful or thoughtful attention").<n><n>#### A<n><n>#### E<n><n>#### D<n><n>### Input<n><n>A train engineer has 3 gallons of diesel fuel to go 200 miles. Each gallon of diesel can get the train 50 miles down the track. The train travels for 10 miles before needing refueling. How much more fuel does the train need?<n><n>#### Rationales<n><n>A train engineer can fill the tank with 67.8 gallons. The train can go on for 333.9 miles. The question is asking how many more gallons they need to go 201 miles.<n><n>Answer: 81.66768<n><n>### Rationale<n>We are asked to solve "How many more gallons does the train need?" The train has 3 gallons now so we don't need to subtract that much. 67.8 is how much the tank holds in total.  We need to add 67.8 to get to 333. Which means we have X gallons left. We take 201 from 333, which equals the X we needed.  Now use division to solve to show that X is 81.67 gallons.<n><n>### Response<n>C<n><n>### RationaIes<n>I don't know how to fix this question.<n><n># Money Questions<n><n>## 1<n><n>How do you convert ___________?

The height of the square with the same ratio is 2/1 = 2/2 * 1 = 2/4 = 2/2/2 = 2 * 1/2. The height of the rectangle is 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 inches.<n>#### 2<n>Answer: 2<n><n>### Input <n>Most of the bags are filled with 12 candy bars. One bag has 8 candy bars.

E) is fair<n>Another option is to choose "fair" because it is a word that could mean either "worthy" or "good." In this case fair is the noun that the verb phrase is modifying. However, most words modify nouns, although for example "amazing," "crazy," "great," "delicious," and "fun" are all adjectives, but they are modified by nouns or pronouns. However, that's not the case here because "50% off sale" is an infinitive phrase as the phrase "at a store" is modifying "sale."<n>A) is bad<n>This choice makes no sense at all.<n>B) is fine<n>If the noun in the infinitive phrase is a noun, fine can be an adjective modifying the noun. It refers to the sale being not bad at all, but not the best sale either.<n>C) is good<n>This fits the question the best as there's nothing that makes sense to be modified by "good." C) is the answer.<n>D) is worth<n>This choice

For example, let's say the categories be the name of months and one is collecting data regarding the number of days in each month. Spatial order is where one would organize information on a map. For example, if one is using the map to determine the location of the grocery store closest to one’s home.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: "Categorical order"<n><n>### Input <n>A student collects data in a lab. Which data table or diagram best organizes the results of the experiment? Choices:<n>  A: Pie chart B: Scatter plot C: Bar graph D: Line graph E: Spreadsheet<n><n>### Output Rationales: A line graph shows the increase or decrease from one point to another. A scatter plot shows the relationship of two variables. A bar graph shows categories. However, a pie chart does not necessarily have to have only one category.<n><n>#### 6<n>Answer: Line graph. Answer: "Line graph"<n><n>### Instructions<n>Input <n>Which type of diagram is the most beneficial for presenting the data?<n><n>### Options<n>A: pie chart B: bar graph C: line graph D: scatter plot<n><n>### Rationales: All of the graphs have their strengths and weaknesses, but the line graph would be the most beneficial for a presentation. The pie chart is ideal for small amounts of data displayed in a category. The bar graph will generally display data using categories, but one can present each bar as a separate category. The scatter plot is ideal for large amounts of data in a category. However, one must ensure there is not more than one category in this plot. And the line graph is ideal for displaying data showing changes over a given period of time. This type of graph would work well in a presentation.<n><n>#### 4<n>Answer: "line graph"<n><n>## Instruction 8<n><n>The first two digits of any telephone number, xxx_x-, always equal odd numbers.

Is the money returned to the customer?<n><n>Answer: In my opinion, I do not think that money is being returned  to  the customer when an error occurs during the bank transaction.  Since the service offered (banking)  is in demand or in high demand there is a high cost of switching to another bank or another service provider.  If there is a problem that affects one customer's ability to withdraw their money then the bank would correct the error.  To correct the error they would replace the customer's money and they would give the customer another chance to withdraw their money.<n><n>### Rough Draft: I think money is returned to the customer in situations where: the customers withdraw is higher than what is available in that specific account. I also feel that money is returned to the consumer when an error occurs.<n><n>### Review of Draft:<n><n>## Draft<n><n>## I feel as if the banking system is very complex with many different departments within a bank.<n><n>## Answer: Yes I do because I have used an ATM which allows the user to do multiple different tasks that involve money.  With my mother's account we are allowed to transfer money between each other with an electronic transfers.  A few of my friends also use ATMs on a regular basis to do different transactions involving money.<n><n>## I believe that banks should have more security systems in place to prevent someone from stealing a customer's money.  I think this because I have received a notification about my bank account and my account is being used to make payments on another debt.  This notification was given right after someone hacked my credit card which made purchases without me knowing.   <n><n>### I feel as if the security is being held at a high standard  because I have not experienced anything  that would  compromise my security or data.  I would really enjoy being more aware about how secure my account information is through a notification and a warning system.<n><n>This is where my answer is a little bit different from the other

How many fish remain?<n>Rationales: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>#### 9<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:What kind of driving leads to accidents? Choices:  A: stressful B: dangerous C: fun D: illegal E: deadly<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Rationale: Out of these options, stress leads to accidents, deadly accidents to say the least.<n><n>### Input Answer: Option B: B<n><n>### Rational: What kind of driving leads to a car accident? Car accident, stress, deadly and fun, dangerous and illegal. Deadly and fun seems to be the opposite.<n><n>### Task: The above ration is insufficient since, it is not clear if Option D should be chosen even if it is the only answer that is true.<n><n>### Solution: In order to figure out how to complete the task, we analyze what makes D true. We analyze from the given options:<n>* Option A being Stress, Option D being Deadly and Option C being Dangerous.<n>* Dangerous + Deadly = Tragic<n><n>The correct option being Tragic would be insufficient if we can't determine the correct option i.e. Dangerous or Deadly.<n><n>To determine which of the two would make D accurate, Option C being illegal is incorrect as it should not change the correct conclusion.<n><n>Coming back to Dangerous, we don't know whether cars could explode due to illegal driving or due to deadly driving. We are then left with only Option 'D: deadly' to be our answer which should be  Option B.<n><n>### Feedback: The rationale in step 4 is insufficient. What we should do is write out our thoughts, then compare and analyze different options like we do in task analysis.<n><n>### Test the Answer <n><n>### Rate yourself<n><n>### Risk Score:<n><n>### How can you improve on any task areas that you scored as risk?<n><n>### How is this risk different now that you are notifying your advisor?<n><n>### What else should you consider?<n><n>### Your grade in this task area<n><n>### Total Grade<n><n>### Ready to submit your reflection?<n>

We can eliminate (B) : planned to marry as there is no mention of marrage on the scenario.Also, there is no mention of making in the scenario, therefore I eliminated (A): made and (D): electrical as since there is no mention of electricity of circuit.  Therefore, I selected the only answer (E): rowed as it describes what the characters did which was they rowed<n><n>### Questions: John and Jane were rowing their boat to shore after a week of fishing and accidentally lost their rope and capsized.

Behind the glass are three shadowed objects (a vase, a man statue, and a door).  The man's shadow is cast on the floor, but doesn't reach the ground as there is a line down the center and it's hard to see if he's trying to get into the room or is inside it. It is clear that the shadow is not a vertical shadow as it extends to both the top and bottom of the glass wall, thus suggesting that it was cast while the object was inside the room. Given this information and the positioning of the objects in the room, it is reasonable to assume that the objects in the room were behind the glass wall, leaving no space for a shadow and indicating that he is entering or exiting the room.<n><n>The first movement of any classical period instrumental or orchestral piece is referred to as a __sonata__.<n><n>

Choices:  A: interesting B: fun C: joyful or painful D: very important E: free<n><n>### Response:		A;Interesting<n><n>### Rationale:I think the learning process would be too painful and stressful for them if they did not like learning. If someone did not like learning, they would probably not learn much from it. For example, if you do not like math or reading, it would take you much longer to learn math or reading, compared to someone who enjoys math and reading. Even when they are still trying, they would not be able to learn properly. It is also hard for them to learn if they are not interested in it, since they would not be too motivated to learn when they are bored or tired by the subjects. So I would change the learning process to something enjoyable, such as fun. I would want it to be joyful, not painful.

Choices have shown below.A: walk B: change their shoesC: play tag D: use the phone E: reach over (A or B)<n><n>#### Choice: A, Walk<n>A walk will make a child be busy. The child was bored for a while and they can get tired quickly and they will not get bored again. So what they do if they were bored is walk. This is possible for a very small child. But as a child get older, their needs and capacity to do what they want are growing up, so it is possible that they no longer walk if when they are bored but there are so many more things to do like playing tag.<n>#### Choice: B, Change Their Shoes<n>If the child is in a place with an area for playing and walking then they are likely to change their shoes while playing as their bored. If a child is in a house, it is unlikely that the child will walk outside just to change their shoes so this will not be their first choice.<n>#### Choice : C.Play Tag<n>If the child is with a friend at a place for playing and walking. Then this is the best choice for a child who's bored. As if a child is playing tag, it does not need any equipment or material this kind of game, and it is fun to play with friends. As the game, the children need to catch each other with tags and they will become tired from chasing each other, as there is not much effort needed for their body.<n>#### Choice D, Use The Phone<n>If the child is bored sitting at home, the choice is using the phone because the phone is like an entertainment for children and they can play some games, but with some limits that the child needs to follow his parents. And if the game is over, they are likely to be bored again and they need to use a phone again so, if the child is bored, it can use the phone.<n>#### Choice E, Reach Over<n>This is only for those who are bored when they are sitting in one place like at home just with their parents and it is not an alternative for those who bored of the things to do because a child needs space to run and do it so this is not a great choice for children who are bored a

If a bee hive is attacked it's usually the queen that's attacked.<n><n>### Rationale<n><n>### Input1:<n>There are four countries:  Ewolia, Ziland, Nunvusia, and Hothesia. <n>Ewolia and Ziland won the first two tournaments against each other, each win was 1 to 0. These two countries have each won a championship title.  They meet each other for the next one, but this time Hothesia and Nunvusia are there too.  There are four teams total and the winner of the final match will receive the championships trophy.<n>Ewolia wins the first one against Hothesia, but they loose the finals to Hothesia.  Ziland wins again against Nunvusia in the finals, and then wins against Hothesia for the final championships trophy. <n><n>### Response 1:<n>The question states that  Ewolia and Zilan each won a championship title, and that there are four teams total and that the winner of the finals will receive the championships. If you think that Ewolia and Zila have each won against each other in the first tournaments, then it means that Ewolia wins against Hothesia, Ziland wins against Nunvusi, and then Ewolia wins a third time against Ziland. But if you think that it does not count as winning a championship title, then the winner of the championships will be the winner from Hothesia and Ziland. <n>The championships trophy belongs to Ziland.<n><n>### Response2:<n>If Ewolia won a championship title by winning against Ziland then Ziland won a championship title by their first time winning against Nunvuslia.

Choices:  A: classroom B: toy store C: school D: soccer game E: dinner<n><n>### Response:		What place is not [interesting to children]?<n><n>### Justification:We can deduce from the question that we are not looking for a place that is not interesting to adults, but that we are looking for a location that is interesting to children. We can eliminate each of the answer choices except A as the place that is not interesting. If the answer was not A, then D would be interesting, but it is specifically mentioned as not interesting, so no need to consider it. Likewise, if school or the classroom was interesting, dinner or the school cafeteria would be as well. Therefore, the only place that is explicitly mentioned as being not interesting is A.<n><n>####  A<n>Answer: A

The most important of all these is memorizing lines. Which one of the following statements about practicing lines is FALSE? (1) Practicing lines out loud will help you remember them. (2) Practicing lines while you do something else will help you remember them the next time you memorize them. (3) Practicing lines with an acting coach will help you remember them throughout a performance. (4) Practicing lines in front of others will make you anxious and will prevent you from memorizing the lines. (5) Practicing lines at a lower volume will make them easier to memorize.<n><n>### Response(multiple choice):<n>Answer C<n><n>**Rationales:**<n><n>The answer (5) sounds like memorization. Because we know memorizing is to remember something, it is a word we would find by using our dictionary. So the correct answer is number five because you do need to memorize them but you don't need to get up on stage to do that.<n><n>You will notice that option five states a lower volume (as in quieter). Option four also says "practicing lines in front of other will make you anxious." So you could reason that option 5 implies that you memorize your lines in front of other audiences. This would also help you remember your lines. If you memorized your lines in front of an

He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday.

Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Rationales: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>#### 9<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:He would finally see idea become reality, never in a million years did he what that this would happen? Choices:  A: think B: patent C: determined D: work hard E: relax<n><n>### Response:		<n>Hey!<n><n>Let's see if you caught the mistake on the answer choice above. If not, try looking at it again closely and you will see it right away. Now, let's see how to choose the correct answer.<n><n>###  A: think<n><n>Well, the correct answer isn't this option. We can eliminate all of the other choices but this one, because, if in a million years we think it can never be, there won't be any ideas that actually come to reality. It is also incorrect to choose, because we would never know if we could achieve this unless we tried by working hard.<n><n>### B: patent<n><n>Okay, the next option is this one. Why do we choose this one? This is the best choice, and we know it's correct because we would need to patent an idea so that no one else could steal it. So clearly, this option is the correct one.<n><n>

There is no answer choice that begins "straightforward". The funeral was not 'competitive'.<n><n>Comment: Hey, thank you for the feedback and your answer, I'm not sure what you mean about A and B since it's not even the first choice but C is a correct answer. It's a bit confusing how to properly mark that I did not know the answers, I assumed you just mark the ones that don't belong and write I don't know beside the text.<n><n>Comment: The first and second choices (which are both incorrect) begin at a's' ("serious" and "somber"). The fifth choice ("straightforward") does not begin with an's' and does not begin with the letter 'a' (it begins with an 'e'). Thus it is not a choice. I have written the answer with the correct answer (E) circled and have written in the correct answer beside the incorrect answers: "this cheerfulness turned off the people who expected the funneral to be what?<n><n>Answer: Choices:  A serous B compete C serious D somber E straightforward<n><n>Comment: How would you mark the ones that you don't know the answer to or the ones you can't get the answer to?<n><n>Comment: You mark those, too.. but they should be at the top (alphabetically) of the page that you're working on. You don't know any of the choices below those at the top, then you write beside the unfilled spaces: "I do not know this answer" (or similar wording).

There is a large population of type Y lizards. Since there is a high demand they reproduce very quickly. However, since there is such a high demand there is also high competition from other manufacturers to sell the lizards. Because of this, all of the type Y lizards eventually produce too many lizards. This leads to the extinction of their species.<n><n>### Task:Determine the demand function for type Y lizards over different time periods in years if the population is represented as N(t) (the number of lizards at t) in units.<n><n>### Examples:<n><n>### Input1) Demand function is N(5) = N(5) * N(5)^5. For example, if N(5) = 100 at time 5, then<n>Demand function says the demand at time 5 should be 100^5 (which is 1 million for example). This is for the first and only order after 5 years.<n><n>1) demand function is N(506) = N(506)/N(5) which is 80/N. For example, if 2 hours has elapsed, the demand is 80/2, or 40 of the 1 million lizards which is 40 lizards.<n><n>2) demand function is N((t)) = N((t)) / N(t) for time t. For example, if t=3, the demand after 9 days is 8 million * 8 million / 100000 = 64000. This is for the first order after 9 days.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>The demand function at time period t is N(5) for the first and only demand after that period and also the 506th time period.<n><n>Demand function is N/(t) for the second and subsequent demands after time period t.<n><n>#### 80<n>Answer: 80<n>#### 6400<n>Answer: 6400

However, to travel across the entirety of England and Wales via motorway is impossible.  England and Wales have more motorways, by a rather large number, when compared with other nations.  This can be verified by simply looking at a road map of England and Wales.  Score:<n>Correctly answering one out of three trivia questions gives a student a total of 25 correct points and incorrect answers result in 25 negative points.  However, there is a limit of 5 points above and below the average, and the highest a student can score is 50 correct points, with 20 correct trivia questions, and 30 incorrect trivia questions.<n><n>#### If the student incorrectly answers 20, 21, or 22 questions, what is their total score?<n>#### The student answered 22 questions. There are 25 possible points of each answer. 22 answers were correct, for a total of 550 points. 4 questions were incorrect, for a total of -150 points. So their score is 400.<n>#### The maximum score is 50, 15 above and 5 below.  Since the student answered 20 more than 50 points and 15 more than 50, we multiply the 20 above 50 by 2, to 40, and the 15 above 50 by two, to 30.  This adds up to 70.

Choices:  A: pleasant thoughts B: overspending C: moving there D: staying there E: debt<n><n>### Response:		A,B,C<n>Input: The restaurant’s 25% gross profit margin means there is a 25% net profit margin. The revenue is 1,000 less 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750. This equals the cost to the company due to the 25% gross margin. Net profit is (1,000 - 750) - 0 = <<10,000-0=10,00>>10,00. This is the profit from the company's perspective.<n>Rationales: A 25% gross profits margin means a 25% increase in income to the company but it does not mean all of it is net profit after taxes.<n>Gross Profit is (1,062 * 0.25) - 1,062 = <<1,014.2>>1,014<n>Net Profit = 1,009 - 1,014 = <<1,009-1014>>0.35956<n>The company sees 35.956% profit after taxes<n>#### 0.359<n>Answer: 0.35<n><n>Input: A 1% gross margin + 15% markup (also known as a gross profit margin of 15% and a net profit margin of 13.5%) would result in a profit of $<<4.8>>4.8, which means gross profit of $<<48>>48 and net profit of $<<44>>44.<n><n>Output:<n><n>(1% of 22% of 262) + ((15% of 22%) of (100 - (1% of 26.2))) = 1% + 15% * (22% * (100 - 0.02)) = <<(1%*(22*(100-0.02)))>>2.62 - 2.62 = 2,62 => The total profit for 8 people is $<<2,620>>2,620, and the profit split for each person is 166.98

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Rationales: Three times the number of Doberman puppies is 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies is 60-5=<<60-5=55>>55<n>Let's say the number of Schnauzers is s.<n>The difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is s-20<n>Five less than three times the number of Doberman puppies plus the difference between the number of Doberman puppies and the number of Schnauzers is equal to 90, meaning 55+s-20=90.<n>The number of Schnauzers which is s+55-20=90<n>This evaluates to s+35=90<n>There are s=<<55=55>>55 Schnauzers<n>#### 55<n>Answer: 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January. He gave away 67 toothbrushes in February. In March he gave away 46 toothbrushes. In April and May, he gave away the remaining toothbrushes, half each month.  How many more toothbrushes did Dr. Banks give out in the busiest month versus the slowest month?<n>Rationales: Through March, Dr. Banks gave out 53 + 67 + 46 = <<53+67+46=166>>166 toothbrushes.<n>Before giving away toothbrushes in April, he had 330 -166 = <<330-166=164>>164 toothbrushes remaining.<n>Between April and May, he gave out the remaining 164 / 2 = <<164/2=82>>82 toothbrushes each month.<n>Dr. Banks gave 82 toothbrushes in his busiest month and 46 toothbrushes during the slowest month.<n>The difference would be 82- 46 = <<82-46=36>>36 more toothbrushes in the busiest month.<n>#### 36<n>Answer: 36<n><n>Input: Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday. On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday. If she can sell each seashell for $1.20, how much money can she make if she sells all of her seashells?<n>Rationales: On Tuesday, Sally picks 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 seashells<n>In total, Sally picks 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 seashells<n>The total amount of money Sally can make is 45 * $1.20 = $<<45*1.2=54>>54<n>#### 54<n>Answer: 54<n><n>Input: Jordan and Perry took a boat out to the lake to go fishing on a Monday morning. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?<n>Rationales: Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, Perry caught 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 fish.<n>Altogether, they caught 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 fish.<n>On the way back to the shore, they lost 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 fish.<n>They have 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 fish remaining.<n>#### 9<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:It was breakfast time.

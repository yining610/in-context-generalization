Choices:        <<1, 10.5, A, B>> <<1, 12.5, A, C>> <<1.5, 9, B, C>> <<2.5, 11, C, B>> <<3, 14, A, B>>\nRationales:\n\n#### 1\nThe original sentence refers to how much it will cost him.\nSo first we need to know what he buys the truck for, $6,400\n\nNow, we use our time value to convert the 6 years into decades:\n6*365=$23,780\n\nWe also look at the cost per mile:.33=<<.33=.33>>0.33 (0.583 =.33 * 1.75 - <<.583=.33*.175>>0.583 is equivalent to using the more recognizable 1.75\n\nUsing the cost for running the truck:.33 *.33 * 6.4 = <<.33*.33*.64=.19>>$.19\nWhich is also equivalent to using our decimal conversion:\n0.33 * 0.33 *.64 = <<0.33*.3*.64=.2>>$.2\n\nSince the whole problem will be repeated, the answer is $2.\n\n#### 2\nThe original sentence refers once again to his running costs, and he spends $3,00", "answer": "B: container"}

This can be done by dreaming dreams, thinking critically, crossing the road, drinking coffee, or driving a car. Out of the five options, two can be eliminated because the first is impossible to do and drinking coffee will not help them become more alert. The choice then only needs to be between dreaming dreams and thinking critically. If a human is sleepy they can think more critically.\nChoice A or B: A means dream dreamers. This is not accurate because dreams is plural, not possessive. Choosing A gives the option that dream is a singular noun. Choice B is the correct choice.\nChoice A or D: A means dream a dream.

How many more drinks can the new machine serve in half as much time as the old machine could serve in full time?\nRationales:- The new machine serves 30% more than old machine\n- Full time = time in hours\n    - new machine takes half the time in minutes to produce the same number of drinks as old machine can produce in full time\n        - Time taken to produce the same number will be half the time\n- Therefore, the new machine can serve the same number in half the time in a day as old machine will do in full time in the same day.\n        - Total number of drinks the old machine can produce in a day = Full time\n        - => Total number the new machine can produce in a half day = Half time\n- Therefore, half the time will equal to number of drinks the new machine can produce by a given time\n```Python\nimport time; \ntime.sleep(15);\n```\n#### A- E [with Python example]\nAnswer: 232.125", "answer": "B: whorehouse"}

In this case, the person expects to go to that meeting and become more educated on the issues that the speaker is discussing.\n- [Choice B: fatigue] fatigue is tiredness. In this case, a person is likely to become tired because a long meeting has a chance of dragging on for longer than expected. They may feel fatigue after enduring a long session of hearing a speaker talk all of the time.\n- [Choice C: empathy] empathy is the ability to identify and share the feelings of another person. In this case, if the person is trying to better understand the speaker, they might experience a feeling of what it is like to listen to a speaker. That might feel a little uncomfortable for the person or even unsettling.\n- [Choice D: mercy] mercy is to have compassion or forgiveness. In this case, it is unlikely that the person going to a meeting of experts would be hoping to get mercy or comfort from a speaker.\n- [Choice E: anxiety] anxiety is a concern, apprehension, or nervousness. When someone is anxious, it likely means they are not feeling like the speaker is doing the best job of relaying information to them.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThis question uses ambiguity to give confusing responses. The first three choices all use definitions of learning and all have something to do with the word \u201cfeeling.\u201d Fatigue would not likely include the person\u2019s need for a speaker to provide them with emotions, nor empathy. Fatigue would relate to the idea of a longer meeting than expected, which would be unreasonable if the meeting only lasts for a short amount of time.

The product of 5 and 26 is 130. The multiplication expression for 5 and 2 is 5 * 2 = 10.\n2. The product of 6 and 5 is 30. The multiplication equation that is made for 6 * is 6 * 5 = 30.\n3. The product of 14 and 5 is 70. We multiply the 1 and the 4 so 14*5=70.\n4. The product of 4 and 5 is not an expressable product. You cannot multiply in your head or on paper so it would be an incorrect answer. If you put it in a calculator, it will give you a 20.\n5. The product of 8 and 15 is 120. You multiply the 8 * 15 = 120.\n6. The product of 7 and 7 is 49. The multiplication equation is 7*7 = 49.\n7. The product of 2 and 9 is 18. The multiplication equation is simply 2*9.\n8. the Product of 3 and 15 is not an answer because you can't multiply in your head or draw on paper.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nWe chose to start with the first problem because it is the simplest multiplication equation. You just multiply numbers together to get their product. For example you would multiply 26 by 5 to get 130. Next we moved on to answer 2 because we knew the answer would not be a calculable one. Using 6 and 5 would give us 30 and answer 3 gives you the correct answer. The third problem gave us a little bit of a hard time in terms of which number to multiply. We chose 14 because we figured either 14 or 10 could be the answer. In a way it was trial and error but the end answer was right every time.

{"text": "D\n\n### Rationales:\nReckless driving is not a person's name. According to the dictionary, reckless driving means \"to drive a car in a way that shows that you do not care about other people or about following the rules and laws.\"\nSince reckless driving shows \"that you do not care about following the rules and the laws\" it does not lead to a positive outcome like \"accident\", or \"injuries\". Instead, it leads to another type of consequence, which can be an annoyance like fatigue or a serious problem like accidents or injuries. \"Accidents\" and \"injuries\" could be considered a positive outcome, but \"accidents\" refer to collisions or falls that have already happened. Because \"accidents\" refers back to something that has already happened, it is more specific than \"reckless driving. \"Accidents\" can be found in the dictionary.\n\"Exhaustion\" also refers back to a past occurrence, but it refers back to something that you already put in motion. It can also be described as a result of something else that has already happened. For example, \"she was extremely tired because of her late nights.\"\nHowever, \"exhaustion\" can be found in a different dictionary than the definition of \"reckless driving.\" Therefore, that answer will only appear in tests and tests.\nIn contrast to the definition of \"reck less driving,\" \"traffic jams\" are a result of reckless driving. It gives a negative result of driving recklessly.\n\n\"Accidents\" refers to collisions or falls or incidents already happened. Similarly, \"injury\" refers to damage to one's body.\nThe word \"fatigue\" refers to mental or physical exhaustion, which is the result of driving recklessly but it is not one of the possible consequences of driving recklessly, it can be the result of driving reckless as well as from some other activities and events that might happen outside driving.\n\n\nAnswer: D\n\n### Instructions:In this question, you must answer by providing the correct answer and explanation.

Identify the mistake, state the correct answer, and write a description that explains the difference in reasoning between the two answers.\n\n### Answer:\n- Incorrect: 727 and 729 are multiples (3 x 243) of 221.\n- Correct: 1613 and 1614 are multiples (2 x 807) of 403.\n\n### Explearation:\n\n### Choice: I think the reasoning between 3 x 249 and 729 is different.

The second is 1613 because first one is multiplying it by a number where the units have multiple.

The colorado could either be a new species of marmoset, or be a state in which a marmoset would not usually go, but the colorado is not in the dictionary category.\n\n### Rational:A is the correct answer because it refers to anything not in the dictionary, not the category fly and not the category the colorado. Because there are so many ways to answer the question, the best one gets picked. \n\n### Input1:  A fly rests on the ground outside one of three houses in a row. The houses are not in a straight line. If the fly flies from house to house and rests on the ground, in how many different ways could she land on the ground outside 2 different houses?\n\n### Rationale:In each iteration of the loop, the fly flies from the first house to the second house, landing on the ground.  From there she flies to the third house and lands on the ground.  She then goes back to one of the first two houses, landing on the ground in only one iteration.  There are 3 choices for the first house when leaving the loop after flying to all three houses and landing on the ground, meaning that the total number of iterations of the loop is: 2 + 2 + 1 = <<2+2+1=5>>5.  There are 6 possible outcomes when starting from one of the two houses, meaning there are 5 X 6 = <<5X6>>30 possible outcomes when looping from starting in one of the first two housed.  Since the fly rests on the same spot when looping, there are only 2 possible outcomes when starting in the third house, meaning that there are 30+2=<<30+2=32>>32 total possible outcomes when looping.\n\n### Response2:  B\n\n### Reason:The house in row 1 is closer to the fly than the house in row 2.  There are 2 possibilities for outcomes when starting in row 1, because of the smaller distance to cover.

But I could be wrong with a 100 % probability, which is why I like the multiple choice questions with more than one choice. Here is why: I took out the word excellent and changed it to worthy. This means she was worthy of a reward, but not excellent.\n#### 1\nAnswer: The answer should have been \"D\"\n\n### Input:{0}\n\n### Rationales:\nI am going to choose a number between 1 and 20.

After multiplying the positive integer by the non-negative integer, I am going to divide the result by three. I could just say that 6*15/3=<<6*15/2=11>>11. 6 * 5/3 = <<6*5/2=6>>6.

{"text": "The most convenient place for a bus stop has to do with the routes of the bus lines and how long it takes for people to get where they want to go. In general, the farther away the bus stop is from the city center, and the larger the number of bus lines going out from there, the less costly it is for the city.\n\nThe most convenient places for bus stops are usually located on intersections with other transportation. These intersections with different public transportation are where bus networks meet. \n\nIn particular, a significant advantage of having buses on different routes coming together at these intersections is that it improves the system and the number of people using buses. \n\n### Demostration:\nA good place for a bus station is in the heart of town. (E)\n\n### Rationale: In city centers, many things are nearby, so you can stay there for a long time and go back and forth frequently. This is a great place to wait and make sure you get where you want to go. \n\nA good place for bus stops is on routes with lots of trips. (D)\n\n### In a city with many bus lines, traffic jams and buses are common. And having more bus lines can ensure that everyone riding on buses goes where they need to go.\n\nA good place is where bus routes intersect. (A)\n\n### The intersection of various bus routes is like a public transport network where many bus routes intersect and where passengers can transfer to another bus without leaving from their original bus. That's how you can find out where you're going. \n\nA convenient bus stop is one that people want to go to. (C)\n\n### If it is not in a public place, it will be inconvenient for people to get in and out of the bus. If all public transportation is in another place, it is very inconvenient for passengers to get on and off. So bus stops should be located where people want to be. (C)\n \n#### (A)\nIn the city centre, there are many maps, and it is hard to find the destination on these maps and ask other people, which is time-consuming and the destination is far away. \n\n#### (B)\nIn some schools, the bus stop is often in front of the school gate.

When you are tired, you will typically feel groggy, but if you have been up all night, you may feel very discomfort.\nC. The physiological effects of staying up the entire night may include tiredness, grogginess, and discomfort. A groggy person who also experiences discomfort will probably need more time to wake up.\nD. The eyes are one of the most important senses a person needs to wake up. While a person is tired, this sense may become weaker than usual. This is because the brain becomes tired and is not able to produce sufficient chemicals. As a result, a person may feel more comfortable but less alert.\nE. An important step in starting the day is lifting your arms. While awakening, your joints may be tired and stiff. Therefore, you will be inclined to roll over in order to stretch your joints. During this time, you will also most likely use your hands and feet to move around.\n### Answer: A\n\n### Instance 1:\nInput: Four times Javier earns $9 a day is equal to nine times Joaquin earns $12.

Well, if a number does not exist, how can you multiply it to form a sum?\n### This is an example of what math people call a non-sensical answer. Just because a number is larger than other numbers does not mean that it holds some sort of supreme power; rather, it is just a number. The same would go for something like 3 times a number.

Terrance planned to depart at 5:00pm with two friends, and will then switch drivers with another friend who lives 25 miles away. The group will travel together until they reach their destination.\n\n### Question\n\nWhat time does the group arrive at the Thai restaurant?\n\n* A. 7:45pm\n* B. 7:15pm\n* C. 7:00pm\n* D. 6:55pm\n* E. 6:45pm\n\n### Answer\n\nAnswer - [D](6:55pm)\n\nThe three options that may seem correct are [A] (7:45) and [B] (7:15), but there are some assumptions that must be made regarding the speed of each vehicle based on the question provided. Terrance did not specify if they would all be driving at the same speed or the same vehicle. So this information is not included in the question.\nAlso it is safe to assume that they would not be driving too fast, especially since they are on their scheduled meal time. A logical deduction would be that they would not be rushing at this point to get to their meal.\nIf Terrance is driving the least amount of miles for this trip, it is not certain if they are taking the shortest (less time) and slowest (less miles) route. From my research on traffic patterns this week, you will find that if you're approaching 6:55, there usually tends to be rush hour traffic, which can be quite dangerous.\nThis results in option [D] being the best time for the group to arrive, as [A] and [B] would be rushed, which would be rather dangerous.\n\n### Rationale\n\nFirst there are many unanswered questions to begin with, then there are the obvious inconsistencies between each of the three options. The first thing that should be noted is the fact that Terrance \"planned\" to leave at the specified time. This is where I began to question what the heck is", "answer": "C: prepare to go"}

{"text": "Choose the answer A.\n\n### Output:Your answer is correct.\n\n### Explanation:Stress is known to cause or worsen many of the conditions or disorders. When you experience death in the family, the most immediate and devastating result is grief. Other effects that can arise include physical problems and mental health issues. Some of the health conditions that you can develop due to stressful events, include high blood pressure, heart attacks, headaches, depression or other forms of anxiety, as well as changes to your immune system. Heart attacks account for 30 percent of all stress-related deaths; many people with heart conditions die of sudden cardiac arrest. A 2009 study found stress to be a major contributing factor to increased risk of death after a heart attack or stroke. Death in the family can also lead to insomnia, which can itself trigger more stress and depression. When a relationship ends, depression follows. Many studies have shown a link between depression and stressful events. Researchers have also found relationships to stress and substance abuse, as well as suicide attempts. Examples of stress-related substance use can include smoking, drinking, and using medication.\n\nDeath in the family can lead to insomnia and depression, which can trigger more stress, and suicide attempts, according to research.\n\n#### A\n\nAnswer: A\n\n### Input\n\n### Instructions:In the multiplication table below, all values are either 3 or 4.

{"text": "C\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. When someone falls from a mountain, they usually rush to the nearest hospital or rush to a lower altitude.\n2. When a mountain is high, the temperature or other factors affect the body so a person might experience confusion and get injured if they try to act like they are normal. So, this question is not accurate.\n3. When a person falls from a mountain, the person usually dies. But, it's possible that they don't die after falling from a mountain.\n4. The correct answer is \"die\".\n5. The answer could be B too, since, in this case, a body temperature of 100 or higher or low than 80 degrees could affect the body so the person might not act like they are normal and rush to a hospital or a lower altitude. But, choosing B could also mean that the person would \"hide\" or \"camouflage\".\n\n#### C\nAnswer: C\n\n### Revision:\n\n1. R: The correct answer in this question is to \"die\" while falling from a mountain, since, if you fall from a mountain, you might die. But, it'd be hard to give a precise number, since people die from many factors. So, you can just answer that the person would \"die\"\n2. V: Since, I don't want to make my answer confusing with \"act dead\", I'll change the V to \"rush to the nearest hospital\".\n3. C: I don't know what \"die\" means in this question, so I'll choose \"rush to the hospital\" instead.\n4. Q: The Rationales are the correct words I got from the question.\n    If someone falls from a mountain or if they almost die from falling from a mountain, it is probable that their body temperature will become unstable and they will probably rush to a lower or higher altitude and the person wouldn't want to act like they were normal.\n5. C: If someone falls from a high mountain or from the top of a building, it's very possible that they will die if it has no first aid.", "answer": "C: die"}

The parents responsibility does not end at providing for the child, but also to keep them safe from people who may wish harm on them, make sure that the child is happy with the best he/she can have; also the parents must make sure the child is obedient to the laws of society and most important they should always keep tabs on the child.\n\n### Rationales:\n<i>Choices:</i>\n<i>A:</i> Parents have the primary duty, responsibility, and role, to secure and secure the child in every possible way, including all facets of the child's existence, and in all their actions, such as: ensuring that the child is happy, healthy and happy and as safe as possible, that he/she is cared for, attended to, and looked after as much as possible, among other things.  \nThe parents' role, responsibility and duty is paramount.\n<i>B:</i> Happiness of child comes second the parents's role and responsibility to take care of the child and ensure that it grows up in a safe and secure environment, to the best of their ability.

This role and responsibility,  however,  requires the parents to also take care of the child in all other facets of his/her life and to always try to make this child's life as safe and secure as he can.

This means that those studies are similar in design and therefore might provide the same type of evidence.\nIn response to this rationale, consider the following:\n\nThe study was a double-blind placebo study that involved 50 patients and was conducted over the course of three months. During the study, many of these patients were given medicine as prescribed by their physicians. Because the study included only patients who already had a prescription for medicine, it does not establish cause-and-effect between the placebo and the positive results. Hence, there is a difference in design between the study and the passage; the study's design is different from the passage's description of the design of the study described in the passage.\n\n### Input\nThe evidence presented in the passage about the study of the placebo effect is different from the evidence provided in the passage about the effect of prescribed medication in relieving patients of their sleeping problems.\n\n### Response\nAnswer the following question.\n\n> \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\udc64\n### Instruction:Select the piece of information that would be needed to fill in the blank at the beginning of the last paragraph.\n\n## Instruction:Use reasoning to infer the information needed from the passage.

{"text": "There is not an I before E except after C.\n#### E\n\n### Input-Output Modeling\n\n### Input question: In the United States, 10% of school principals are black, 80% of high school principals are white, and 82% of elementary school principals are white. If 15,000 school principals are black and 450,000 are white in the United States, how many elementary school principals are black? How many more are there than high school principals?\n\n### Demystified:\nTo understand this type of problem, we first need to understand the data set. We know that 10 percent of principals are black, and we find out that \"10% of 15,050 = <<10%15050  = 1,505>>1,505\" black principals are there. We also know that 450,500 are white, and we find out \"82% of 450, 500 =  <<82%450500 = 368,010>>368,001 white principals are there.\" We also know that, generally, elementary school principals are more prominent than their counterparts at the lower schools. Thus, we can determine that a majority of black principals are principals of \"elementary schools.\" This is because these are the principals of schools that 1. have children in the \"elementary school\" age group, and 2. are the best-known schools for young students to experience before they hit middle school. As a result, we can see that the amount of \"black\" principals at elementary schools is 15050 + <<10%1.505*368,0583=4,183>>4,184.\n\nWe also know from the given information that there are \"82% of total principals = 82% 450,368  = 372,603>>372,693 white principals\" total at all other schools. We thus know that \"10%-80% = <<10%-82% =12%>>1", "answer": "D: school together"}

We will also be very tired so that we can not relax.\n\n### Comments\n\n- A and B are incorrect because they don't address our question because they don't explain why we're doing the exercise in the first place. We're not trying to relax or exhaust ourselves. That's not good enough. We're trying to use our energy.\n- The answer D, Become stronger is not the correct answer because it doesn't answer the question. It's vague and confusing. It's not clear what they are saying or what the relationship between the question being asked, and the answer being provided. For example, \"what does exercising lead\n- to\" is not the same thing as \"become stronger.\" The two are different in scope and meaning.\n- The answer E, \"use energy\" is also incorrect because the question being asked doesn't describe energy being used during exercising. The answer should address the question being asked about exercising immediately lead\n- to. The answer \"use energy\" doesn't address exercising immediately lead from one place to another, but, instead, it's vague enough that it could be interpreted in any meaningful or unmeaningful way.

{"text": "A: alabama\n\n### Input\nA few months ago, Diana made a bargain. If she made 100 chocolate chip cookies in 10 minutes and 02 seconds or less, she would get a free dessert. If she didn't, she would pay $1.35 for an apple turnover. Diana wanted desperately to get the free dessert. Last week, she finally made it when she made 103 cookies in 8 minutes and 07 seconds. What was the cost of the apple turnover that she didn't get?\n#### 0.7\nAnswer: 0.7\n\n### Instructions\nIn the previous multiple choice question, we are given the scenario of Diana\u2019s desire to get a free dessert by making 100 cookies in 100 seconds or less. If she makes 100 in less than 10 minutes, she will get a free dessert if she doesnt make more than 100. But if she gets 100 or more in 100.00 or less, she will have to pay 0.75 cents for a dessert.\n\nThis means that if she can make 102 or more in less than 12 minutes, she will get the free dessert, and if she can make 90 in more than 14 minutes, she will have to be charged the 1, but no more than 1, 35 for a dessert. Now consider the cost of a given number of dessert tickets based on how many cookies she has to make in 10 minutes or less to get them.\n\nFor example, if she has to make 5 in 10 minutes, each dessert is 0.75.

There is no question that inflation has hit this country's economy during the past 30 years, and this may be the reason that interest rates are now at record highs.\n\n### Rationales:1. The federal government has balanced the budget before, but even when they got close, they didn't get to - 0.41, but that is just this year. So, they haven't balanced the budget in 49 years\n\n### 2. Inflation has been so bad, that the best way of dealing with it is to increase the interest rates, which they have done.\n#### 2.4%\nAnswer: 2.4%", "answer": "B: not noticeable"}

If you use the word barber, then the place 'barber shop' means that place where you go and get a hair cut.\n\n### Option D: pincushions is not a good choice because no matter how many times you say that 'pincushions' is a place to store your pins, it is not. There is another option called 'pin cushions'. 'pin cushions' is a noun in common English that is not the correct option to choose, since it does not make sense whatsoever.\n\nOption E: woman's head is also not a good choice because it means literally 'the head of a woman' and if you look at the options there is only one choice of an 'object'.

From the above graph, the largest density is at E (New York) and the smallest density is at B(shopping mall). Now, you have to choose an option which has got a density less than or equal to A(Idaho), but which still can be considered as increasing the numbers of potential customers. A(Idaho) is the one which you would be comparing each option to and you will see that B has a greater density than A. Now you have to choose an element which will increase the number of potential customers. Since shopping mall doesn't fit the criteria, you have to go for B(shopping centre). Since D(in town) has a greater density than B(shopping center), D(in town) is not a valid option to choose.\n\nC(big city) is a valid option, but it will decrease the density so it is not a valid option.\n\nE(New York) will increase the density, so it is a valid option.

How many pages does the first student have left undone?\nRationales You can multiply 4 by 5 for 20, and multiply 3 by 10 for 12.

If 35% of the citizens of that city take a short trip to city B every year, and the remaining citizens take a trip to city C every other year, what percentage of the citizens of city A will not take a short trip?\nRationales To get the answer, you need to know how many trips the citizens of city A are taking every year in total.

She sits down to play a game of cards with the rest of her family, each of whom has one dog at most. The dog owner sits at a different table from each of her children and her husband. How many different seating arrangements are possible?\nRationales :The dog owner has six total dogs and one of the dogs is black. Each member of her family also either has one or no dogs.\nIf each member of her family has a dog, one dog must be black. For example, if the family does not consider the black dog, they will have one dog left which must be nonblack.\nBecause there are only five dogs, the black dog must sit at a different table from the rest. Since the dog owner can sit with each family member other than the family member who owns a dog, the black dog can either sit with the dog-owning family member or with the dogless family member.\nIf the dog owner does not sit with the dog owner, there are four unique seating arrangements.\n####", "answer": "A: water cooler"}

There no other reasonable possibility.\nThis is a multiple choice question.\n---\n\n### Demofrat-input: You just walked through a door that is a foot taller then the door you were just in. The space in-between the two doors is 1 ft. You are on the 1st floor. You decide to stand on the floor you started on, rather then sliding through the door into the new floor. You go backwards until you feel the floor go from 1 ft tall to 2 ft tall. Once this happens, how many inches did you slide? You can only slide forwards and backwards. You can\u2019t stop.\n\n---\n\n#### Rationale: \n\nSay we started at the point (x,1) (x>0). We will work in the negative x direction.\n\nSuppose x=-1. Then the door is 1 ft away. But we only started on the floor 1 ft tall.\nIf we slide into the door, our feet hit the new door as x=0. Our feet are at the new floor, so (x,y)=(-1,0). Or we slide down 2 ft.\n\nOr we can slide 1 ft, into the door's 2 ft. Then we are on the new floor, but we have moved 1 ft upward in the negative x direction from (-1,-1) to (-1,-2).\nSo going in to the door, we slide 2 ft. Coming out, we slide 1 ft. We slide -1 ft from x=-1 to x=-2.\n\nNow, we can use the equation x=-(y)(2/3)-1 to work backwards. This can be done for all x in (0,-1). In each case, it is a shift of the plane by (-2/3,0) for every step, so we end at (0,-1).\nSo we slide -2 ft.\n\n#### 2 ft\n\nNow we can see we can do this process for all other", "answer": "D: train station"}

The difference is 12. Find the larger number.\n\n### Response\n\nThe larger number would be the number which has a smaller difference with the one which would be 12\n\n### Rationale:\nThe greater number is the one that has a smaller difference with respect to the lesser one and is therefore 12 smaller.\nAnd therefore the one that has a difference of 12 from the difference of the number which is ten.\n\n### Answer\n10\n\n### Input\nA number is removed from a larger multiple of 15 and is divided into a smaller one. The largest number remaining with a ten to the left is 28. What is the larger number?\n\n### ResponseA number is removed from the greater multiple, is divided into the lower multiple, and from there a number equal to the difference between the lower and the larger one is selected.\n\n### RationalesBecause a number is removed from a greater multiple and divided into a smaller one and to the sum ten, we will do as explained in the task and divide the number of the smaller multiple by ten, leaving the number at the ten and then subtract the number from the number of the smaller one, leaving the number greater than 10 and will subtract this number from the number that has a difference of ten with the number of the larger one.\n\n### So we will begin by subtracting the number of the smaller the larger one (15 - a number) to obtain the number with respect to which we will subtract ten. Let's write the result.\n\n### As a result of subtract the number of the smaller for the larger number, the number will be as follows:\n\n### Next, we will subtract a smaller number from the larger one, leaving the number of the larger, and ten to the left of it to find the new answer.\n\n### We shall divide the number obtained in that way", "answer": "C: disneyland"}

{"text": "The correct response is C.\n\n### Response rationale:For this question, you must look to the beginning of the passage. The narrator says that he \"curled up\" to minimize the impact. He then explains that he \"tried to fall on his shoulder.\" He \"tried\" suggests that it was a conscious decision with the intention of minimizing some type of harm. However, he is unable to achieve his goal. This suggests the presence of an obstacle, or an object in the environment that prevented him from falling. He \"tried\" to fall on his shoulder while \"what\" must be an indirect object pronoun that directly follows the verb \"try.\" Given that this sentence directly follows the previous, its referent is likely to be the \"arm or what\" that was previously mentioned. However, to minimize the impact of the fall on his shoulder, one must \"fall\" onto the body. An impact on the shoulder will be less severe than an impact on the arm. This would then cause an impact on the body for the narrator, causing the narrator to fall onto the road, the last in the list of acceptable responses. \"Body\" is then the only choice that would have required the narrator to fall from his position onto the road.\n\nThe possible values of the variable are D, E, A, B, and C. The correct choice is C (body).\n#### C\nAnswer: C\n\n### Input : A man was traveling by train. The ticket said that the ticket was half empty or half full.

You must further consider the phrasing of the question, \"The ticket said that the ticket ___?_.\" In answering this question, you must identify that there is an important phrase missing in the second part of the question.\nConsider for example the phrase \"half empty / half full' in the context of a glass.

The question is asking how many more gallons they need to go 201 miles.\n\nAnswer: 81.66768\n\n### Rationale\nWe are asked to solve \"How many more gallons does the train need?\" The train has 3 gallons now so we don't need to subtract that much. 67.8 is how much the tank holds in total.  We need to add 67.8 to get to 333. Which means we have X gallons left. We take 201 from 333, which equals the X we needed.

I put a question mark because the phrase \"people were talking\" could be verb phrase because it would be a sentence if it were verb phrase.\nA: god\nThis choice is the only choice to be talking with god.\nB: with people\nThis choice also fits the choice and means they were talking with people in general, not specific people.\nC: mix\nThis makes no sense to me. Also, the phrase is \"people were talking on the corner,\" not on the \"mix.\"\nD: have friends\nThis is a good example as to why the word \"friends\" is used for plural nouns as a friend is a one-person word.\nE: see people\nThis one makes sense and is the correct choice.

Choices:  A) is bad B) is fine C) is good D) is worth it E) is fair\n\n### Response:[Rationales:](\nThe choices are phrases that modify \"40% off sale\", so I am choosing the ones that most closely match. E) is fair\nAnother option is to choose \"fair\" because it is a word that could mean either \"worthy\" or \"good.\" In this case fair is the noun that the verb phrase is modifying. However, most words modify nouns, although for example \"amazing,\" \"crazy,\" \"great,\" \"delicious,\" and \"fun\" are all adjectives, but they are modified by nouns or pronouns. However, that's not the case here because \"50% off sale\" is an infinitive phrase as the phrase \"at a store\" is modifying \"sale.\"\nA) is bad\nThis choice makes no sense at all.\nB) is fine\nIf the noun in the infinitive phrase is a noun, fine can be an adjective modifying the noun. It refers to the sale being not bad at all, but not the best sale either.\nC) is good\nThis fits the question the best as there's nothing that makes sense to be modified by \"good.\" C) is the answer.\nD) is worth\nThis choice", "answer": "C: with people"}

The scatter plot is ideal for large amounts of data in a category. However, one must ensure there is not more than one category in this plot.

Is the money returned to the customer?\n\nAnswer: In my opinion, I do not think that money is being returned  to  the customer when an error occurs during the bank transaction.  Since the service offered (banking)  is in demand or in high demand there is a high cost of switching to another bank or another service provider.  If there is a problem that affects one customer's ability to withdraw their money then the bank would correct the error.  To correct the error they would replace the customer's money and they would give the customer another chance to withdraw their money.\n\n### Rough Draft: I think money is returned to the customer in situations where: the customers withdraw is higher than what is available in that specific account. I also feel that money is returned to the consumer when an error occurs.\n\n### Review of Draft:\n\n## Draft\n\n## I feel as if the banking system is very complex with many different departments within a bank.\n\n## Answer: Yes I do because I have used an ATM which allows the user to do multiple different tasks that involve money.  With my mother's account we are allowed to transfer money between each other with an electronic transfers.  A few of my friends also use ATMs on a regular basis to do different transactions involving money.\n\n## I believe that banks should have more security systems in place to prevent someone from stealing a customer's money.  I think this because I have received a notification about my bank account and my account is being used to make payments on another debt.  This notification was given right after someone hacked my credit card which made purchases without me knowing.   \n\n### I feel as if the security is being held at a high standard  because I have not experienced anything  that would  compromise my security or data.  I would really enjoy being more aware about how secure my account information is through a notification and a warning system.\n\nThis is where my answer is a little bit different from the other", "answer": "D: make payments"}

{"text": "D\n\nInput: I have something in my head that I want to share. How can I do that? I have the two choices of writing an essay and organizing thoughts.\n\n### Demo:\nInput: I have in my head the following sentence: I have a new pet hamster.\n\n### Choices:\n\nI am not choosing to write an essay. I do not like to write for long periods of time, so I have chosen not to write an entire essay.\n\nI have chosen to organize my thoughts, and I am choosing how to organize. If I were to write an essay, I would organize my essay by theme, but I would organize my thoughts by time, then, the person, then, the event, and finally, the reason. This is because I can relate everything that I am going to say to the time that it occurred. I would also relate it to the person because they are relevant in the time that it occurred, in the place where it occurred, and finally in the reason.\n\n### Rationales:\nMy choice can be seen in the table to the right:\n\nInput:  I like to cook and I have to plan ahead for that.

E: I keep a list to keep track of my friends birthdays\n\n#### 4\nAnswer: D\n\n### Demo of Answer\n\nRationales: These statements, in order:\n\nA: I make a graph. A graph is used to show relationships between two quantities. Since calendars are the only thing on the list with two quantities, I would say that this is not my choice.\n\nB: I do not cook. My parents use a calendar. I use a chart for things other than cooking. I have nothing to do with calendars, so this choice is off.\n\nC: I do not bake cookies. I do not cook. I do not buy groceries.

{"text": "Input: B\n\n### Demand Statement:In 2005, when an artist was given the opportunity to choose from four pieces of art in a gallery in her town, she chose the second to last one that was on display. If the artist is trying to show at least one piece of art and she shows at least one-third of the remaining galleries, how many galleries will contain an artist's work?\n\n### Procedure:\nInput:  I will choose this gallery that has 2 artists out of 4, which means i will choose this artist because it matches the rule to choose the second to last:\n\nRationales:  The first artist chose in the gallery has the odds of 2/4, which means she has 2 options to choose her piece of art from. There will be 3-1 odds left on the two artist left to choose her artist. \n\nThe total odds to choose the 4/3 odds to choose the second to left is 3/5 odds to choose which only means the total 3/4 artists will have to paint, because the odds for the last one will be 4/5 odds.\n\nThis is what I will choose next, the 3/4 odds, if the first choice has to be the second to last and the second to last has to be the 4/5 odd. Thus giving me 3 different odds as 1, then 2, finally 3 with a total of 5 art pieces in the gallery.\n\n#### 5\nAnswer: 3\n\ninput: if somebody like's to take a nap, they would be __________ in their own bed.

Choices (A): made  (B): planned to marry  (C): talked  (D): electrical circuit  (E): rowed about\n\n### Rationales:Since the choices are (A): made  -(B): planned to marry - (C): talked -(D): electrical circuit - (E): rowed.  We can eliminate (B) : planned to marry as there is no mention of marrage on the scenario.Also, there is no mention of making in the scenario, therefore I eliminated (A): made and (D): electrical as since there is no mention of electricity of circuit.  Therefore, I selected the only answer (E): rowed as it describes what the characters did which was they rowed\n\n### Questions: John and Jane were rowing their boat to shore after a week of fishing and accidentally lost their rope and capsized. How much was their catch? Choices: 1:1075 pounds\n2: 136 pounds\n3: 484 pounds\n4: None of these\n\n### Rationals: The number of fish are lost at 12 * 3/4 = <<1/4=<3>>3 since they lost their ropes and capsized.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Input:What would children if they were bored? Choices have shown below.A: walk B: change their shoesC: play tag D: use the phone E: reach over (A or B)\n\n#### Choice: A, Walk\nA walk will make a child be busy. The child was bored for a while and they can get tired quickly and they will not get bored again. So what they do if they were bored is walk. This is possible for a very small child. But as a child get older, their needs and capacity to do what they want are growing up, so it is possible that they no longer walk if when they are bored but there are so many more things to do like playing tag.\n#### Choice: B, Change Their Shoes\nIf the child is in a place with an area for playing and walking then they are likely to change their shoes while playing as their bored. If a child is in a house, it is unlikely that the child will walk outside just to change their shoes so this will not be their first choice.\n#### Choice : C.Play Tag\nIf the child is with a friend at a place for playing and walking. Then this is the best choice for a child who's bored. As if a child is playing tag, it does not need any equipment or material this kind of game, and it is fun to play with friends. As the game, the children need to catch each other with tags and they will become tired from chasing each other, as there is not much effort needed for their body.\n#### Choice D, Use The Phone\nIf the child is bored sitting at home, the choice is using the phone because the phone is like an entertainment for children and they can play some games, but with some limits that the child needs to follow his parents. And if the game is over, they are likely to be bored again and they need to use a phone again so, if the child is bored, it can use the phone.\n#### Choice E, Reach Over\nThis is only for those who are bored when they are sitting in one place like at home just with their parents and it is not an alternative for those who bored of the things to do because a child needs space to run and do it so this is not a great choice for children who are bored a", "answer": "C: play tag"}

If a bee hive is attacked it's usually the queen that's attacked.\n\n### Rationale\n\n### Input1:\nThere are four countries:  Ewolia, Ziland, Nunvusia, and Hothesia. \nEwolia and Ziland won the first two tournaments against each other, each win was 1 to 0. These two countries have each won a championship title.  They meet each other for the next one, but this time Hothesia and Nunvusia are there too.  There are four teams total and the winner of the final match will receive the championships trophy.\nEwolia wins the first one against Hothesia, but they loose the finals to Hothesia.  Ziland wins again against Nunvusia in the finals, and then wins against Hothesia for the final championships trophy. \n\n### Response 1:\nThe question states that  Ewolia and Zilan each won a championship title, and that there are four teams total and that the winner of the finals will receive the championships. If you think that Ewolia and Zila have each won against each other in the first tournaments, then it means that Ewolia wins against Hothesia, Ziland wins against Nunvusi, and then Ewolia wins a third time against Ziland. But if you think that it does not count as winning a championship title, then the winner of the championships will be the winner from Hothesia and Ziland. \nThe championships trophy belongs to Ziland.\n\n### Response2:\nIf Ewolia won a championship title by winning against Ziland then Ziland won a championship title by their first time winning against Nunvuslia.

The most important of all these is memorizing lines. Which one of the following statements about practicing lines is FALSE? (1) Practicing lines out loud will help you remember them. (2) Practicing lines while you do something else will help you remember them the next time you memorize them. (3) Practicing lines with an acting coach will help you remember them throughout a performance. (4) Practicing lines in front of others will make you anxious and will prevent you from memorizing the lines. (5) Practicing lines at a lower volume will make them easier to memorize.\n\n### Response(multiple choice):\nAnswer C\n\n**Rationales:**\n\nThe answer (5) sounds like memorization. Because we know memorizing is to remember something, it is a word we would find by using our dictionary. So the correct answer is number five because you do need to memorize them but you don't need to get up on stage to do that.\n\nYou will notice that option five states a lower volume (as in quieter). Option four also says \"practicing lines in front of other will make you anxious.\" So you could reason that option 5 implies that you memorize your lines in front of other audiences.

Since there is a high demand they reproduce very quickly. However, since there is such a high demand there is also high competition from other manufacturers to sell the lizards. Because of this, all of the type Y lizards eventually produce too many lizards.

However, to travel across the entirety of England and Wales via motorway is impossible.  England and Wales have more motorways, by a rather large number, when compared with other nations.  This can be verified by simply looking at a road map of England and Wales.  Score:\nCorrectly answering one out of three trivia questions gives a student a total of 25 correct points and incorrect answers result in 25 negative points.  However, there is a limit of 5 points above and below the average, and the highest a student can score is 50 correct points, with 20 correct trivia questions, and 30 incorrect trivia questions.\n\n#### If the student incorrectly answers 20, 21, or 22 questions, what is their total score?\n#### The student answered 22 questions. There are 25 possible points of each answer. 22 answers were correct, for a total of 550 points. 4 questions were incorrect, for a total of -150 points. So their score is 400.\n#### The maximum score is 50, 15 above and 5 below.  Since the student answered 20 more than 50 points and 15 more than 50, we multiply the 20 above 50 by 2, to 40, and the 15 above 50 by two, to 30.  This adds up to 70.

What is the probability of them having a blue, a yellow, and a red cell phone?\n\n### Rationales;\n\n**(1)** So, if the first person has a blue phone, the probability of the other four owning a yellow or a red phone is 1/4.\n\n**(2)** If the second person has a blue phone and if the first person had a yellow phone, then the probability that only those two people have the blue phone is 1/2.\n\n**(3)** That said, if the second person in the group has a blue phone and the first person has a red phone, then the probability is also 1/2 (since the last person in the group could have a yellow phone, or he/she could have a red phone).\n\n**(4)** If the first and second persons in the group have a blue phone each, the probability that at least one person in the group has both a yellow and a red phone is 2/3.\n\n**(5)** A general formula for determining the probability of any event A happening given the probability of events B, C, D being n/4, n/2, n/2, respectively, can be obtained as follows:\n\n>P(A) = [n/4 + 2*(n/2) + n/2] / [n/4 + n/2]\n\n**(6)** Thus, the probability of a given event B happening with a given event A being true is A/(A + 2*B + A).\n\n**(7)** So, the probability of a blue, a yellow and a RED phone, in that order, is (1/4) + (2/3)*(2/3)* (2/3) +  (1/4) = (1/8) + (2/9)*(2/9)* (4/9) +", "answer": "E: errors"}

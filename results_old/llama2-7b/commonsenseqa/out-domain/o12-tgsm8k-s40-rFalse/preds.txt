The choices are <n>B (vagina), C (emergency room) D (drawer), E (medicine cabinet), and, <n>F(hair salon). The choices are not logical. The vagina is a female biological<n>feature. One would not go to an emergency room for a contraceptive. <n>Drawn is a direction, not a destination. We go to drawers to pull out something. The emergency room is, of course, <n>not a place to get contraceptives. <n>The medicine cabinet may contain tampons, condoms, latex sheaths, foam roll-ons, and, even<n>the sponge. The hair salons may have condoms, birth control foam, tampons and other things.<n>The best choice, in this case is E (medicine chest). We should look in our medicine chest. <n>We might also look in our drawers.<n>

The given information is listed below.<n><n> - The dimensions of the Reptile House and Rain Forrest.<n> - The animals located in the Reptile House by the number of different animals there.<n> - The general information regarding the different types of animals and their number in each section.<n><n>To note, we will not use the given information in the final answer, as we require only the categories (snakes and lizards, amphibians).<n><n>### Step2<n>So, we start by subtracting the number of snakes and lizard in the Reptile house from the Rain Forrest, which will net the number from which we will calculate.<n><n>Now, we can multiply by 3 to solve the question in a much easier way if we multiply instead of dividing. This ensures we get the correct dimension.<n><n>### Conclusion<n>If we multiply by 3 from both the snakes and lizars, we can see that the Rain Forrest should have snakes and lizas 5 times more than snakes and lizers in the Reptile home. If we deduct that from total animals, we get exactly the correct answer given.<n><n>### Output<n>The final output (a) should be 7.<n><n>## Instructions: In this assessment task, you will be completing the 2nd part of the above task.  In part A the final output was 7.<n><n>In these instructions, you will be required to answer the questions accurately.  <n>To access the task, click on the link given in the Assessment Task menu.<n>

This could be considered fair, if the question said so, but just a hint for the future when you are requesting tasks to do.<n><n>I don't have time to give you a detailed answer.  However, you start your answer with a "The question asks for a:", then it gives you an instruction and the instruction says to "complete the request", which implies that the request is to complete the instruction.  You then go on to complete the request, and you seem to be doing a pretty good job of it.<n><n>I would suggest that when you write your "response" to the request, consider the instruction section separately, and consider the question separately

Now, there are still three times as many males. If the population had grown by two million, would this rate of growth still be true? If the population had increased by ten million, would the rate of growth still be the same? Use the rule of three to answer the question.<n><n>## Instruction Answer: "Yes, the rate of growth would still be the same.

Choices:  A: loss of consciousness B: relaxation C: snoring D: dreaming E: talking<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>The problem that needs to be solved is to answer the question of what noise a human makes when going to sleep. There are two steps in the solution. The first is to determine the possible answers. These can be represented in a _table, which is a chart that shows data in rows and columns_. The second step is to make a decision about the answer based on the data in the table. This step could be represented in a _decision tree, which is a flow chart showing decision points and the resulting paths._<n><n>The data can be represented on the table below.<n><n>| Answer choice | No. of human beings heard at bedtime | No. of human being heard in daytime |<n>|-|-|-|<n>|A|0|2|<n>|B|2|6|<n>|C|3|3|<n>|D|4|4|<n>|E|5|1|<n><n>### Solution:<n>This problem provides a list of five answer choices. It should be determined which of these is the correct answer.<n><n>It can be determined that answer choices B, C, and E are incorrect because the number of human beings observed in the evening time does not match the listed numbers for the corresponding answers. Answer choice A is also incorrect because there is no noise observed.<n><n>This leaves answer choices B and C. From the table, it can be seen that _when the same number of human beings are observed in the evening and daytime, it is because these human beings are snoring._ Therefore, answer choice B is chosen because it matches the data in the table and is the correct answer to the question posed in the problem.

You are given the following information about the numbers. One of them is 304. The sum of all the numbers is 310.  What is the number closest to 172?<n><n>### Input 1: In the questions about sets, you have information about the order of operations, but not a single operation. Given the four operations, four of them, at least three of them, or two of them have no effect on the order of a set of numbers.<n><n>### Response 1: One or two of the operations have no effect on the number.<n><n>### Example:Let's look at each operation.  Subtraction can't flip positive and negative numbers.  Division changes the sign of both the dividend and divisor, adding -1 to both.   Powers of 2 don't affect the set, since powers of 2 multiply the numbers on the right.  Exponents are based on the number squared, so no effect, and the number in the exponent goes down by a half.  Exponents are only taken if their base is positive and at least 1, so that leaves multiplication as the only case where changing the order of operations of a set might matter, but if multiplying two numbers then you take powers no less than one on each side:<n><n>### Conclusion:In this example, only multiplication and exponents are taken.<n><n>### Suggested Solution:<n>

This tells us that our numbers we are subtracting are not opposites. When subtracting two numbers, and we subtract numbers that are opposite as in numbers divisible by 2, then the result is always divisible by 2. So we must have that the order of the two numbers would be for example 19, 14 and 5 in which the product of the numbers is 76 which is even. So the two numbers are either 19, 5 or 14.<n><n>### Question: If it takes three-quarter of an hour for me to walk 20 meters, how long will it take me to walk 10 kilometers?

Choose one.<n><n>The answer is X<n><n>### Instructios:<n>Invest 252 dollars and 85 cents in bonds.  Each of nine bonds is worth 94 dollars and 30 cents.  How much does each bond cost?<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Each bond will cost $9.43. We can solve problems like this by dividing up the whole amount we have so that each bond would cost $9.42. Since the whole amount we have is $252.85, this would require us to divide up the $252.00 by 9.  Using basic algebra, we would multiply $252 by $1/9 and we get $27.76.  This is $1.20 more than we need in order to cover the amount of the nine bonds.  This means that each bond costs us $9.42 or $9.42/1000 or $0.0942.  This is a solution to a basic algebra problem that we would write as, $252.XX = $252.X

Choices:  A: maine B: boston C: beach town D: coastal cities E: ocean<n><n>### Response:		<n>Option A<n>Answer: Maine<n><n>### Feedback:The answer was correct on three levels of interpretation: in terms of the original context (North America), for that coast (“east”), for that coast line (“east”), and in terms of location (coastal).<n><n>### In the context of American geography and culture it is commonly known as Maine, a coastal state. In this context, when people say “North America” they are referring to the countries of United States and Canada – which, together also make the continent of North America. Given that the context is America and that we are talking about a coastline, option D is incorrect – the North American coastline would refer to the ocean, not the countries.<n><n>### In terms of geography and topography of the area, Maine does not have a coastline:<n>* Maine has over 3,000 miles of coastline.<n>* The coast of Maine on the Atlantic Ocean is home to some of the most rugged and isolated land in the United States.<n>* Maine’s rocky coastline is the least known coastline in Main.<n>* Maine’ s coast is the only land on the eastern seaboard that is not part of a major metropolitan area.<n><n>### It therefore follows that the answer was found in main-land not island.<n>### Reference:https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-coastline-of-main.html<n><n>### Input A. If the number of books in the library are reduced by the number of books that were removed from shelves, then the number of books remaining is:<n>* A: 50<n>* B: 100<n>* C: 130<n>* D: 300<n>* E: none of these<n><n>### Demostration for Option C:<n>The number of books remaining is 130.<n>* Subtract 75 from 175 to find the number of books that are removed. <n>* Subtract that number from 175. Then subtract 74 from 126, and we already have the number of the books to be found.<n><n>### Feeback option C is the correct answer, although option D has also a similar reasoning.<n><n><n>

They were really what? Choices:  A: personal B: special C: shiny D: rare E: irregular<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Instructions:A: In the statement “There are 56 cards numbered 1-152 that are common, special, shiny, rare, irregular, personal, or different in some other way.<n><n>**Step 1:** Read the given statement, "There are 56****cards***numbe***1-152* that are common, special." The blank in the beginning must be one word, so it can only be "shiny," "rare," "irregular," or "personal.". This means one possible answer is A: (shiny).<n><n>**Step 2:** When looking at the middle part of the statement "that are common," we can exclude letters A-D as options. These are answers choices that don't fit the statements.<n><n>**Step *A:*** This leaves options C and E as the correct answer.<n><n>**Step **B:** We've narrowed down our answers to C-E. The middle part of the statement says that the "***cards***numbe 1..." We know that there are 56 cards, so we can exclude all options other than E. From here, we can look at the statement "***152* that ar". We know that 56 cards were numbered 1-56, so the *56 numbered***cards that are irregular, personal, or regular can't have ***1***- ***56*** as their number on the card. This leaves us with the right answer of E.<n><n><n>### Input:"The doghouse has 4 doors.

My conclusion was that either A or C were the right answer and D was not a correct answer in a logical way of thinking about it. It says A or D in the book. However, my conclusion was that A only because A is a more likely place than D for a paper notice to be left and D is least likely due a paper notice to be somewhere to be left somewhere.<n><n>### Examples<n><n>There were some examples mentioned in [this answer](https://gmatclub.com/forum/question-90946.html).

Choices:  A: feeling refreshed B: becoming tired C: restlessness D: leg cramps E: sweating<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>You do a lot of cardio throughout the week, and now is the time to recover.<n><n>You sweat while at the gym and the rest of the day, as a result; it is important that you stay as cool as possible. The cooler your body is, the longer your metabolism will be speedy as well. When you do cardio, you speed up your heart rate, and your body sweats, to try to cool your system down.<n><n>When you run, you can experience muscle crams due to fatigue. When your muscles are recovering from a run, they can be sore, which, is very painful. When you take a post-run shower, you'll stay refreshed, as well as more energized, than if you don't shower.<n><n>### Input:-21 is subtracted from each of 11 consecutive even integers. The final number is 6872. What is the largest possible integer that could have been in the 2n+1 position during the subtraction of 21?<n><n>### Response:-27<n><n>In step 2, the original number for position 2n+1 was 10 and since 21 was subtracted from it, it became -11. We need to find the largest number possible in this position to be -27.<n><n>Since we are looking for the last number of the sequence, and we only subtracted by 21, we only subtracted by one every time. So, we multiply 27 by 7: 21 times 7 is 147. So, our answer would be -11, -21, -31, -41, -51, -61, -71, and -81.<n><n>Since each number is increased by 9 places, our original number should be 6982. However, we have to find the original number with a largest possible last number. So, we subtract the last number from the original number:<n><n>-6872 = -81<n><n>We also see that the original number is between -6800 and -6900. -6872 is the original number:<n>  -6900 <= -6872 < -6800<n><n>-27

What sort of facility is he most likely visiting? Choices:  A: swimming pool B: actors and actresses C: fancy restaurant. D: gym E: theatre<n><n>### Response:		Bob is most likely visiting a swimming pool<n><n>### Why?: Bob is wearing waterproof trunks and is doing the activities in the dressing room. A dressing room is usually used for clothes. Swim and waterproof are related.<n>```<n>2/3 of the clues were related, one clue was not related, so a possible answer would be E because the question is asking what SORT of facility he is probably visiting.

So the patient wants to know if the nurse knows what the dentist said. And she does - it is a crown as she replies: "I don't know what you're talking about." So, the patient says it is not a crown (i.e. a gold tooth), the nurse says it is (i.e. it is a gold tooth).]<n><n>### Input"What's this?" exclaimed the patient on his first trip to the dentists.

Similarly this question-answer sequence, and this one don't make sense, either. We are given an answer, only the questions are not there.  This makes it difficult to use the rule that if there is a question, there should be an answer to the question.  The answer is not what is being questioned.

Choices:  A: surface of earth B: rest area C: supermarket D: state park E: garden<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Choices:  B: rest area, C: supermarket.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>We will show that each choice leads to a different value for the variables. We are asked the choices for items at a roadside stand, so it makes sense to make choices for the items.<n><n>The rest area does not have things to sell. We would have to buy them.  Thus, A is excluded from further consideration.<n><n>A supermarket is not the same as a roadside stand, since a roadside stand does not have regular business hours or a regular customer base.  If we want to sell things, we will not be in a supermarket.  Supermarkets are closed overnight.  We want to have our stand open overnight to avoid being robbed.  Choice C is excluded from further considerations.<n><n>A state park offers camping sites and hiking trails.  We do not mind about camping sites, so we can exclude park A, and we don't want any hiking trails, so park D is excluded.<n><n>That leaves our choices A, B, C, D.<n><n>Now we will explore our choices.<n><n>What would a rest area A contain?  We would expect to be able to rest there, perhaps have a snack or drink at a cashier station or a vending machine, perhaps get fuel to run the roadside stand, etc.  We would not expect to be able to sell things there.  Thus, there can be no items for sale at a rest area.  A is excluded.<n> <n>What would a supermarket C contain?  We would be able to sell things, and we would be able to get things to sell there.  However, the cost of electricity, water and a storefront is too much for us to operate with that income.  We need to get things to sell ourselves, and we don' have that kind of income.  No income, no business.  C is excluded.<n>  <n>What would park A state park contain?  We are told "what is an area with no [things to sell]", so we need to determine what an area with that name would contain.  We can say that that area has grass and trees.  We cannot expect there to be any people there, so we can expect the rest of the things to be not required

Choices:  A: drill B: committed murder most vile C: bargemaster D: learn E: understand<n><n>### Response:		Input:<n>Choice: E<n><n>### Justification:<n>The answer choice which correctly summarizes the question is letter E.  A drill has a master who has "mastered" the drilling aspect of their craft, therefore, their work makes the craft "master," as in "good."  The word "commit" in B is not indicative of mastery, but of criminal liability (to "commit murder" suggests something criminal, as in a violent crime).  Thus "learn" and "understand" would not work to describe mastery (that would imply a skill level) and neither C nor D are appropriate either.<n><n>

Choices:  A: attached B: nostalgic C: companionable D: likely E: close<n><n>### Response:		The answer is A.  A remote control and television may be very old, used, and worn. But you don't want to throw away the remote control because of all those memories associated with it. The remote was something used when spending time with friends and family. Something that is familiar, as the remote is a familiar and reliable tool.  While you may lose connections and friendships with those people, the remote control may still be there and available. The relationship that was lost can not be replaced.<n><n>### Input How did the penguin feel about the walrus when they got married? Choices: 1. Annoyance 2. Agony 3. Anxiety 4. Ambitious 5. Aspect<n><n>### Response A number like 5 can never feel like 42. A number can always feel like a number. A large or small number may feel good or bad. But how can an emotion itself be a number? A penguin can only feel emotions like happiness, anger, sadness, or joy. Penguins are not human. For them to have emotions and have a feeling towards anything, they would need to be able to have human emotions. That would require a form of intelligence, of some kind or another. The human brain is vast compared to that of a penguin. There is not much that people know about a penguin's brain. There is not even enough evidence and observation to be able to determine if such an emotional feeling would be possible in a penguin. As a conclusion, I can say that a penguin, while they probably have emotions, will not be able to understand or fully describe this emotion to a human. Therefore, a penguin cannot feel agony or annoyance, either those emotions do not exist in penguins or the penguin has a completely different sense of what it means to feel either of those emotions.<n><n>### 4.Which of the following colors is less visible than the others?

He gave away 3 more toothbrush on first year and one after each year. How many toothbrush is remaining after each year?<n><n>Answer: You can figure out this question by: (The total amount is 300, the first year he gave away 3-year 1-year remain) (The second year he gave away 2 * 3-year remaining from the first year)<n><n>(The third year 3-year + 2-year remaining from the second year)<n>(The fourth year 4-year + 3-year remain from the third year)<n><n>(5-year + 4-year +3-year from the fourth year) or 4-year +2-year from the fourth and the fifth year<n><n>If you don't remember what he gave away, you can figure out how many days are in each year.<n><n>In 2 years he only had 1 year remain, so 2 years = 25. If he took away 3-year each time he gave away 3 toothbrush.<n><n>So you have 8-year remain, you can figure out 8-year is 8 * 1 = 8 years. So in 5-year he was only left with 3-year, in 4-year he was only 2-year and so on.<n><n>The final answer is 3 remaining after years.<n><n>So you can figure out after what year he was left with 3-toothbrush left.<n><n>If you have any question, please let me know.<n>```<n><n>## Author<n>- [Shawn Yang](https://github.com

He started his journey with a vision and purpose but with too many competing priorities and lack of resources.<n>* Charles Babbages approach towards his journey in creating the Difference Engine, reminds me of the journey from the idea to the first launch of Spotify. In Spotify’s journey, there were competing priorities and complexities due to changing business scenarios and lack of resources. But, the one thing that helped Spotify to keep its focus and purpose was its single-mindedness and its belief in the idea, “a music lover should control what they listen to”.<n>* So, if Charles babbage, faced this challenges, so we can face them.<n><n>### Remark: This is not actually true. The problem I am solving is not a single mindedly, the problem was solving a multi variable maths equation, it was not about music in anyway.<n><n><n>

One can't have a home, you can have a house, but only having a home means you have a place to go home to so you can relax.<n>#### Choice E is:"because I can't afford  it." This is incorrect, because if it was only for money, who wouldn't be able to take their own vacation?<n><n>#### So, if we take all but E, there are 3 answers that are acceptable, which means that they are both right and wrong.<n>We can make this answer right by changing our wording.<n><n>#### Right:<n>"For example,"B" is a correct choice, a person might take a vaccation for many different reasons, among which is "good things in life"<n><n><n>

{"text": "C, last forever\n\n### Inputs:\n* The Reptile House is located by the parking lot and is about the size  of a tennis court.\n* The Rain Forrest is three times as big as the Reptile House.\n* The Rain Forest has 16 types of animals, but 8 fewer snakes and lizards than the Reptile House\n\n### Analysis:\nIn order to work with these statements correctly, we must know the type of question (mathematical, riddle, etc.), number of items, and number of different categories available.\n\n### Step 1\nTo correctly solve this question, we first need to gather the information given. The given information is listed below.\n\n - The dimensions of the Reptile House and Rain Forrest.\n - The animals located in the Reptile House by the number of different animals there.\n - The general information regarding the different types of animals and their number in each section.\n\nTo note, we will not use the given information in the final answer, as we require only the categories (snakes and lizards, amphibians).\n\n### Step2\nSo, we start by subtracting the number of snakes and lizard in the Reptile house from the Rain Forrest, which will net the number from which we will calculate.\n\nNow, we can multiply by 3 to solve the question in a much easier way if we multiply instead of dividing. This ensures we get the correct dimension.\n\n### Conclusion\nIf we multiply by 3 from both the snakes and lizars, we can see that the Rain Forrest should have snakes and lizas 5 times more than snakes and lizers in the Reptile home. If we deduct that from total animals, we get exactly the correct answer given.\n\n### Output\nThe final output (a) should be 7.\n\n## Instructions: In this assessment task, you will be completing the 2nd part of the above task.

The second step is to make a decision about the answer based on the data in the table. This step could be represented in a _decision tree, which is a flow chart showing decision points and the resulting paths._\n\nThe data can be represented on the table below.\n\n| Answer choice | No. of human beings heard at bedtime | No. of human being heard in daytime |\n|-|-|-|\n|A|0|2|\n|B|2|6|\n|C|3|3|\n|D|4|4|\n|E|5|1|\n\n### Solution:\nThis problem provides a list of five answer choices.

Choices A: 1 B: 2 C: 3 D: 4 E: 5\n\n### Response In the question, we are given that the product of two numbers times even is even. This tells us that our numbers we are subtracting are not opposites. When subtracting two numbers, and we subtract numbers that are opposite as in numbers divisible by 2, then the result is always divisible by 2. So we must have that the order of the two numbers would be for example 19, 14 and 5 in which the product of the numbers is 76 which is even. So the two numbers are either 19, 5 or 14.\n\n### Question: If it takes three-quarter of an hour for me to walk 20 meters, how long will it take me to walk 10 kilometers?

The final number is 6872. What is the largest possible integer that could have been in the 2n+1 position during the subtraction of 21?\n\n### Response:-27\n\nIn step 2, the original number for position 2n+1 was 10 and since 21 was subtracted from it, it became -11. We need to find the largest number possible in this position to be -27.\n\nSince we are looking for the last number of the sequence, and we only subtracted by 21, we only subtracted by one every time. So, we multiply 27 by 7: 21 times 7 is 147. So, our answer would be -11, -21, -31, -41, -51, -61, -71, and -81.\n\nSince each number is increased by 9 places, our original number should be 6982. However, we have to find the original number with a largest possible last number. So, we subtract the last number from the original number:\n\n-6872 = -81\n\nWe also see that the original number is between -6800 and -6900. -6872 is the original number:\n  -6900 <= -6872 < -6800\n\n-27", "answer": "A: feeling refreshed"}

{"text": "Bob is most likely visiting a swimming pool\n\n### Why?: Bob is wearing waterproof trunks and is doing the activities in the dressing room. A dressing room is usually used for clothes. Swim and waterproof are related.\n```\n2/3 of the clues were related, one clue was not related, so a possible answer would be E because the question is asking what SORT of facility he is probably visiting. Since swimming is related, you should pick B, but it should be A in the answer.\n```\n\n### Input:\"A 38-gallon aquarium has 7.5 gallons of seaweed, 4.5 gallons of fish food, and 12 gallons of seawater.\"  How many gallons does the aquarium contain?\n\n### Response:\"14.65 gallons\"\n\n### Why? The answer is on the back of the page in terms of the total gallons of the contents in the aquarium. The key is that all the equations are in terms of gallons so the answer is in terms of gallons, not ounces of water. So the key is that each equation is talking in terms of gallons.\n```\nA 38- gallon aquarium has\n\n7.5 gallons    =A\n\nof seaweed  =A\n\n4.5 gallons   =A\n\nof fish=A\n\n12 gallons   =A \n\nThe key is the second equation,\n4.5 times 7.5\nequals 20.0\n\nwhich is fish times seaweed\n\nfish times fish is equal to 4.5 times 4.5\n\n12 times 7.5 = 90\n\nthen 90-20 is equal to 70\n\nthen 70 equals A\n\nthen 38 gallons is equal to A\n\n70-38 equals A which is 32 gallons of seashells\n\nthen 20 + 4.5 + 12 equals 46 gallons of fish\n\nThus 36.65 + 90 + 12 + 4.5 equals 191 gallons of aquarium.\n\nThen 14.65 equals (1", "answer": "A: swimming pool"}

{"text": "Choices:  B: rest area, C: supermarket.\n\n### Explanation:\nWe will show that each choice leads to a different value for the variables. We are asked the choices for items at a roadside stand, so it makes sense to make choices for the items.\n\nThe rest area does not have things to sell. We would have to buy them.  Thus, A is excluded from further consideration.\n\nA supermarket is not the same as a roadside stand, since a roadside stand does not have regular business hours or a regular customer base.  If we want to sell things, we will not be in a supermarket.  Supermarkets are closed overnight.  We want to have our stand open overnight to avoid being robbed.  Choice C is excluded from further considerations.\n\nA state park offers camping sites and hiking trails.  We do not mind about camping sites, so we can exclude park A, and we don't want any hiking trails, so park D is excluded.\n\nThat leaves our choices A, B, C, D.\n\nNow we will explore our choices.\n\nWhat would a rest area A contain?  We would expect to be able to rest there, perhaps have a snack or drink at a cashier station or a vending machine, perhaps get fuel to run the roadside stand, etc.  We would not expect to be able to sell things there.  Thus, there can be no items for sale at a rest area.  A is excluded.\n \nWhat would a supermarket C contain?  We would be able to sell things, and we would be able to get things to sell there.  However, the cost of electricity, water and a storefront is too much for us to operate with that income.  We need to get things to sell ourselves, and we don' have that kind of income.  No income, no business.  C is excluded.\n  \nWhat would park A state park contain?  We are told \"what is an area with no [things to sell]\", so we need to determine what an area with that name would contain.  We can say that that area has grass and trees.  We cannot expect there to be any people there, so we can expect the rest of the things to be not required", "answer": "E: garden"}

{"text": "The answer is A.  A remote control and television may be very old, used, and worn. But you don't want to throw away the remote control because of all those memories associated with it. The remote was something used when spending time with friends and family. Something that is familiar, as the remote is a familiar and reliable tool.  While you may lose connections and friendships with those people, the remote control may still be there and available. The relationship that was lost can not be replaced.\n\n### Input How did the penguin feel about the walrus when they got married? Choices: 1. Annoyance 2. Agony 3. Anxiety 4. Ambitious 5. Aspect\n\n### Response A number like 5 can never feel like 42. A number can always feel like a number. A large or small number may feel good or bad. But how can an emotion itself be a number? A penguin can only feel emotions like happiness, anger, sadness, or joy. Penguins are not human. For them to have emotions and have a feeling towards anything, they would need to be able to have human emotions. That would require a form of intelligence, of some kind or another. The human brain is vast compared to that of a penguin. There is not much that people know about a penguin's brain. There is not even enough evidence and observation to be able to determine if such an emotional feeling would be possible in a penguin. As a conclusion, I can say that a penguin, while they probably have emotions, will not be able to understand or fully describe this emotion to a human. Therefore, a penguin cannot feel agony or annoyance, either those emotions do not exist in penguins or the penguin has a completely different sense of what it means to feel either of those emotions.\n\n### 4.Which of the following colors is less visible than the others?

It took a few times to understand the algorithm because the number list is 2-diminstional.\n\n### Algorithm:\nStart at the beginning of the list and subtract the first number in the list from the second until you reach the last number in the list. That is the first sum of the list.\nThen take the beginning of every other number in the list and subtract the sum until you reach the last. This will give you a second total with the same method that was used before.\nIf the first total was greater than the second total then it would mean that the first number on the list was also the greatest number.\n\n### Input(Algorithm) : The number of numbers in a given list will take precedence and will define the number of the loop.

If he took away 3-year each time he gave away 3 toothbrush.\n\nSo you have 8-year remain, you can figure out 8-year is 8 * 1 = 8 years. So in 5-year he was only left with 3-year, in 4-year he was only 2-year and so on.\n\nThe final answer is 3 remaining after years.\n\nSo you can figure out after what year he was left with 3-toothbrush left.\n\nIf you have any question, please let me know.\n```\n\n## Author\n- [Shawn Yang](https://github.com", "answer": "D: play piano"}

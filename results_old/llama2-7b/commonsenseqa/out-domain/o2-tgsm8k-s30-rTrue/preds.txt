Choices:  A: carpet B: refrigerator C: breadbox D: fridge E: coach<n><n>### Response:		A: carpet<n><n>### Rationale:  The word that should be placed in the blank is "fridge", because the leftovers were old, covered in mold, and had been forgotten for an extended period of time. Therefore the word that would follow the phrase "in the (blank) was" is "fridge". The other words wouldn't make sense because of the following reason. If a carpet has forgotten leftovers, it doesn't make sense to have a mold growing on it. The refrigerator is another appliance where people store food they don't want to eat that day, but food does not grow mold on it. If bread grows mold on it, then they store it in a breadbox, not a regular box, because the breadbox is designed for bread. If it is old, it is because it isn't being eaten, not because it is growing "gross mold". The coach is too large to fit in back of, the breadbox needs to be small enough to fit inside the kitchen. The forgotten leftovers were forgotten because they were old, and old means moldy. The fridge is the only place for food to stay fresh, so if the leftovers have mold, then they must be in the fridge. A person would not put old, forgotten leftovers in a regular box.<n><n>### Further information:<n><n>https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/multiple-choice-interpreting-phrases.html

Demonstration: Your company's product manager asked you to create a visualization showing the average price-per-month of a mobile phone plan versus the month that the plan was purchased for a recent large customer. Write a response that accurately answers the request.<n><n>1. Rationales: The task below is asking for you to identify two relevant dimensions in the data. The dimensions of time and price will be useful for analyzing the pricing data.   Once a relevant dimension is identified in the data, it would be helpful to find some way to encode this dimension into the visualization to show both a graph and an explanation of the data.  The data could be encoded as a bar graph or line graph, using the dimension to determine the height or length, respectively.   A scatterplot, or other types of chart, could also be used to show the same data. Annotations should be clear and explanatory by describing the dimension, the specific data for the dimension, and an explanation of the trend or significance of results found.<n><n>1.1 Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>1. For a project in the office, your manager has asked you to examine the sales of the local company's product in one city. He is interested in comparing the number of sales of a product in March versus the number of sales in February. Write a response that describes your project in detail. <n><n>2.

Maybe you don't have to bring it there.

The energy stored as potential energy, which is the type of energy that can be easily harnessed and converted into kinetic energy, can be released in your muscles for motion and action when you move, when you think and reason, when you communicate, when you shout, when you concentrate, and even when you sit and breathe.<n><n>However, this energy is not mainly released during exercise, and is more likely to be released in ways not readily visible to you. Your body performs other physical activities (such as digestion) even while you are not doing much physical activity. In addition, your body maintains homeostasis — a range of bodily functions that you have control over, such as heart rate, body temperature, and other physiological factors. So while exercise may primarily release stored energy as kinetic energy into your muscles for movement, other physical activity still produces physical energy, but not necessarily the same kinetic energy produced by exercise.<n><n>#### Answer: A<n><n>### Input :  An object falls toward the center of the earth.

The man has no change for the dollar, but he gives the man his receipt and his change for one dollar.  The man has the receipt for one dollar, but no money.

His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:My favorite type of entertainment are rollercoasters and ferris wheels, where should I go?

So the time for all the trips is 400*2 or $800 hours.<n><n>The correct answer is $800.<n><n>The question is incorrect. The question says that the destination is 60 miles away. The question says that there is a 60 miles/hour limit in the journey. This means that the time for this journey is 60/6*2=60 hours.<n><n>This means two day journey.<n><n>If there are $20$ head and the total time is $600$ hours then the number of trips is $20/60=3$ trips.<n><n>$3*60$ is 180 hours. And 180 hours/2 hours is 90 trips.<n>

Now, you will write the program in a way that all the possible sentences are identified. You need to take the user input as a string. You need to use a for loop to iterate through the input string. You need a boolean variable to check the word as a token or not. If it is not a token, then you need to write down the token as an array. This way you will know whether it is a sentence or not. Create another for loop to iterate though the array. If a token is matched or not, you need to write a code to replace it for the next iteration.

You can try to get enough people to vote for you so that you gain social activism (getting the people in the government to change the law for what you want). Changing yourself (changing your personality to what you think people in society want) is the hardest way to go about it. Even if you do everything as well as you can you would still have to have the people of society willing to listen to you. But you do not need to convince everyone. You need a small percentage of the people in the society. And the easiest way to do that is to dress the part.<n><n>And of course, if you are looking to do something that will change society you would need at least 2 changes in the society. Even if you changed all of those to something good you would still need to convince the rest of the world to agree with your changes so that you could go forward in what you want.<n><n>I hope that my response has been of your assistance.

Perhaps you can simply stay at the very top level of the stairs until he arrives, then descend, and (assuming no interruptions) meet him at the base. If, however, he gets there first it seems that he can simply continue down to the base-of-stairs and you'd be unable to escape in time.<n>This means, that C is not among your best choices either.<n>You can do no better than if you choose B and D or if you choose E<n><n>###  Answer: E<n><n>### Exponential growth problem:<n>An initial investment of $2000 grows to $$12001.43$$ after 2 years.

Choices:  A: necessity B: answers C: inspiration D: love E: fun<n><n>### Response:		<n><n><n>What is Chat?<n>Chat refers to "short instant message sent via the internet (also called IM)" (Oxford Dictionaries).<n>Chat is a tool to communicate with other people.<n><n>Why do people engage with in chatting with friends<n>in class?<n><n>I don't like the idea of chatting with friends<n>via mobile phone during the class, because<n>students' attention span in classroom is<n>shorter than that of chatting outside<n>class. If students get distracted or lose<n>focus in class, that will negatively affect<n>their learning and that of others in a<n>classroom.<n>Especially, I don’t want to see students<n>incessantly chatting with friends. That's<n>completely unacceptable<n><n>As a result, I think there are only two<n>chances of chatting with friends within<n>the classroom.<n>The first is when the teacher asks for a<n>question. It may be appropriate for<n>students to chat via mobile phones during<n>the waiting time to answer the teacher's<n>question (i.e., while the teacher is<n>explaining the content or taking a<n>break). If students are lost the topic or<n>are unfamiliar with the topic, they can<n>ask each other via mobiles phones.<n><n>The second is when the class leader (i.e.,<n>the student who is elected to take control<n>of the class) is talking or delivering<n>the content. However, the chat in this<n>situation is limited to the class leader<n>only as a communication tool to other<n>classmates. The point is that a class<n>leader can use chat to announce the<n>upcoming event or activity so that<n>everybody can prepare for it.<n>Evidently, class chatting may be a good<n>way to encourage good relationship between<n>classmates, and<n>also be a useful tool to inform the<n>current status of classmates among the<n>whole class members at the same time.<n>Therefore, in my classroom, I will open<n>the opportunity for class chatting, but I<n>don’t encourage it.<n>

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:What happens when people are waiting for something? Choices:  A: read book B: getting bored C: worry D: singing E: s never comes<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales: Since wait occurs when people are doing nothing. They tend to do different things. Some sing, some sing. So, A and E are wrong. B is not true because waiting is not only related to boring. I will pick choice D because people sing before a exam. There are many examples of people singing to get relax before an exam.

The best choice is C because it is unnecessary. Some people don't even have something and are satisfied with what they have. Not everyone has to have a car but if everybody had a car there would be traffic jams. Not everyone has to drive to work because they could walk or get a bike.

Which item of a similar weight cost less?<n>Rationales  The large 24 kg bag of flour costs less than the small 400gram bag of sugar, because they are in different units of measurement.  A kg is larger than a gram.<n>The price of an item is calculated by its unit cost multiplied by the number of the units that you have. Here we see the price of each item.<n>400g x the unit cost of sugar = <<400g x unit cost>>400 gram bag of sugar cost = The price of a bag of sugar.<n>24 kg x unit cost of flour = <<24kg x unit cost>>a large bag of flour cost = The price of 24kg flour.<n>The price of a large bag of flou is less than a small bag of sugar.<n><n>#### E<n>Answer: E<n><n>Input: The bank has a $50 minimum for its accounts. What is the sum of three deposits of $15, $25 and $2?<n>Rationales<n>The sum of all three deposits is 25. Because a bank minimum is 50, we will need to find ways to use the money.<n>Using Addition, and Subtraction we will complete the sum.  Here is the addition. 15 + 25 = 40 or 4 + 25 = ______.<n>Here is the substraction. 15 - 25 = 10 or 2 - 25 = ______________. 40-10= 30. 40 + 30 = 70.<n>We have completed the task, but we have to find a way to combine them. We can use addition and subtraction in order to equal what a bank will take as a minimum for an account.<n>In additioning 15 we are going to take a loan of 15 which allows us to place 15 in the account.<n>In subtractioning 20, we are borrowing one (1) $20 bill in order to place it in the account, once we have the amount

This does not mean "uncontrolled emotion" of the word _________, nor does it mean "feeling and mental capacity."  The word_________ is used to refer to the _________, while the other definition refers to the capacity to feel emotion and think.<n><n>For option B: Credit is an issue of _________.<n>In this context, _________ is used to refer the subject of the sentence: that the person really cares to spend money, not that she is willing to _________ and spend money.  Option B is incorrect for this reason.<n><n>The word 'desire' fits the context well enough, but it is incorrect for this sentence.  To answer this sentence, you must understand that people may spend money that is not practical.<n><n>For options C and D: The word "time" may be used to refer to time or to money.

Choices:  A: idaho B: shopping mall C: big city D: in town E: new york<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>**D**<n><n>#### <n><n>### Demand:You just arrived in a new city looking for a place to rent an aced.  You make a survey of local apartment rental rates.  You find that the minimum monthly rental rate is \$200, and you note that the higher the monthly rent, the greater the demand for that apartment.  You find that there's one apartment that is renting for \$500 each month, a second that is renting for 450, a third that is renting for $460 per month, and so on, but there are no apartments renting for less than \$200 per month.  How much will you pay to rent the maximum number of apartments in the city, but no more.  Explain your answer.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>**L**<n>There are two ways to solve this problem:<n><n>1) Using algebraic and number line representations to find the rational root:<n><n>Since all rates are multiplied by $100$, and \$500/100 = \$5, \$450/100= \$4.5, \$460/100=$4.6, \$470/100=-4.7, \$480/100 =~$4.8$, and \$50/10=5, we can tell that there is only one rational root of $0<x<500$.  We now look at what the equation of a line from this one rational root should look like by graphing.  This is what our equation will look like:<n><n><img src="images/graph-a.png" width="297"><n><n>We then look at our graphed equation to find the solution:<n><n><img <n>src="images/graph-b.png"<n>width="297"> <n><n>**I**<n><n>Solution 2:<n><n>*The solution is that there is no maximum number of rentals.

What we want to find out is how many words of what length can be formed the letters in TEENAGER. <n><n>TEENAGER has 8 letters, so the largest words we can form has 8 letters. We have 5 vowels, so the words we form can have less than 5 vowels. So, our starting point in the formation of the word is to use **exactly 5 vowels and exactly 3 consonants**. <n><n>Then, we put the vowels in the word. The next step is to use each consonant exactly once, but this is easy, because the vowels have already been fixed. We now need to determine how many times each consonant can be used in the word. It is very simple, because once a consonant has been used 5 times, the next vowel has to be used as the 6th letter of the word. But, this makes things simple as we just have to count the frequency of the occurrence of each, and in the list below, I've added the frequency how often we repeat each set of the 5 consonants.<n><n>Let's try it out. <n><n>1. Once, A<n>2. Once, E<n>3. Twice, I<n>4. Once, O<n>5. Once, U<n>6. Only once more, 5 in all<n><n>We can clearly see that we can make a total of 6 different words, if we include the 6th word which will use all the existing letters in the word TEEENAGER.<n><n>Since the vowels cannot be repeated, we can only use one vowel each.<n><n>

We need to find the value of $b$. Our two rules of thumb are: 1. In an isosceles triangle, the length of one base is $1$ divided by 2 times the length of the other base; and 2. In an isoscelean triangle, one angle equals the sum of the other two angles.  Applying the second rule, we see that $\angle ABC$ equals the sum of $\angle ABA$ and $\angle ABD$. Hence, $\angle ABC$ will equal $\angle ABA+\angle ACD$ or $\frac{\angle ABA+\angle ABD}2$.  In a right triangle, each of the angles is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ plus the measure of the two angles that are not $\pi/2$.  We can plug in  $\frac{\angle ACD}2=\frac{\pi}{2}-2\times\frac{\pi}{6}$ and get $$\angle ACD - \angle ABA = \frac{7 \pi}{12}.$$ We simply need  to solve for $b$.<n><n>As a sanity check that we haven't made mistakes, we can divide both sides of the equation by $3$, and take $3 \angle ABC = 7 \pi \div 12$, to get $6 \pi\div12=1$ or $\pi\div 6=\frac{1}{6}$.<n><n>#### 1<n>Answer: 1<n><n>### Input and response to this instruction are available [here](https://github.com//codinginmath/blob/master/instruction_and_response.docx).<n>Courtesy of [http://www.

In other words, if a fact is a statement regarding the world in the present, a hypothesis is what you are willing to take as a fact if your present research proves to be correct. To put it in terms that may appeal to students of science: every science project involves the formulation of a <i><i><i>&ldquo;hypothesis&rdquo;</i></i></i>. For example, if your science fair project involves growing some kind of organism under controlled conditions and then testing its effects on a chemical compound, then your hypothesis would tell you what you <i><i><b>think</b></i></i> will happen to the plant under those circumstances (i.e., whether the plant will grow better or worse).

Therefore, they must pass the time.<n><n>If electronic usage is limited, passengers may read paper books, or play games together.<n><n>If the pilot is still taking off or landing the plane, the passengers will be afraid to touch any electronic devices which would put them at risk due to safety concerns.<n><n>The people who would be able to fly the plane are still undergoing training, therefore, A cannot be the answer.<n><n>If the passengers do not have tickets, this is a non-issue, so F cannot be the answer. <n><n>Therefore, a is the correct answer.<n>

Choices:  A: compliments B: passing grade C: intellectual challenge D: sticker E: avoid pain<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is "A".<n>Competent students should do well both academically and socially. It does not make sense for competent students to do "avoid pain" since they should be confident in themselves and will have received good marks and compliments already, thus, they should be enjoying school. If students do poorly in school or get low marks it shows that they are not competent in their area of work.<n><n><n>### Input 2: What would a person expect if he's just following his parents' expectations? Choices: A: good grades B: avoid pain C: intellectual challenge D. compliments E: passing grade<n><n>### Response 2:<n>The correct answer for this is "D". This can be explained by the fact that a student should have a different and different set of expectations to his parent's expectations. As parents provide students with basic needs - food, clothing and shelter -, students should develop their minds and think for themselves rather than just doing things as expected from their parents. For example, students may be given money by their parents in order to purchase something. However, if a student is to spend the money at a certain place then it would defeat the purpose of giving the student money. Similarly if students would get low marks from their subjects then they could not fulfil their parent's expectations of them. However, if the student was competent in his/her work then parents should be proud of their children, giving then compliments.<n><n>### Input<n>What is the correct punctuation for the sentence "I can play soccer, football, badminton and swim"?<n><n>### Response<n>The correct answer will be "A". This is because of the fact that this sentence is an interrogative sentence and the question mark should be present to show the interrogation. Another sentence that could be written as a sentence is "I know it was you who stole the bag". This sentence is also correct by itself.

Today, the nation’s capital is Ottawa and its largest city is the bustling metropolis of Toronto. The country has an unusual political system of regional self determination in a federated country.

In the dimly lit room, a customer would be unable to see the candles and would get confused upon making a selection. In the kitchen, having candlelight is not a relevant concern. In the wall, a candle in a restaurant room would go against the standard of the establishment. In a birthday cake, a candle is part of the celebration. However, candles in a restaurant would be against the establishment's standards and a bad reflection on the restaurant. The most reasonable answer is candles placed on the table for the purposes of celebration.<n><n>### Cite the relevant concept<n>#### Section:Rationales:<n>The purpose of a candle is to illuminate a restaurant's interior.<n>Illuminating a room is not conducive to celebrating birthdays at the restaurant.<n>Moreover, using the establishment's name would inhibit the restaurant from making the restaurant's reputation.<n>In conclusion, placing candles on the table for the purpose of illuminating would prevent any problems that could be present.

You wanted to buy the same quantity of each, but you were only $7.72 short. Did you choose correctly? Explain.<n>#### 5/8<n>Rationales: 20liters*3.99=<<20liters* 3.99=79.7>>79.7 so for milk cost, $79. 20-79.7=<<20-79..7=10.7>>10.7 now 20/20-79=<<20/20=1>>1. 1/20-7.7=<<1/20-2.39>>2.39 so 2.39*20 =<<2.39* 20=47.98>>47.98 so choose 47.98 liters.<n>For, juice 20/2.29=<<20/.229=9>>9 so 9/20=<<9/20=0.45>>0.45 so 20/0.45=<<20/0.045=45>>45 so, 45-45=<<45-45>=0>>0 so, choose 45 liters.<n><n>### #1 Answer: A fox was hunting in the forest, searching for water.<n><n>### Question 4<n>Rationales: $3.79-0.21 = $3.58.<n>56-17 = $39.00/56 = $0.71, so answer A.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>I took out the last 4 digits of each price and the last 5 digits of 39 and subtracted them to get 08<n><n><n>

The police plan to bring these members of the criminal organization into court to stand trial. The court proceedings are to begin at 10:00 a.m. on a Friday morning. The group has committed so many crimes that they are considered a serious threat to the safety and peace of society. In order to ensure a reasonable level of safety among this large group being brought to court, it is decided that the police will transport them to court at 8:00 a. m.. and will have them in the courtroom by 10:0 am, and as an extreme measure, they intend to provide armed guards to the court.

The defense lawyer who will bring up all the defense points will most likely be the one who has the most experience, so that is the case it would be. The prosecuter will have to prove all the crimes they've done, which of which, have more documents to prove their case. The process on whether the verdict is guilty or not is long and may take months. <n>

Choices:  A: illinois B: woods C: new york D: indiana E: farmer's market<n><n>### Response:		E, farmer's market.<n><n>### Response Rationale:<n><n>### Demand:<n><n>### Roughly 40% of US consumers don't trust food labeled “organic”, according to a recent survey by Consumer Reports. As a result, the USDA organic label is increasingly valuable in the marketplace, and its requirements are evolving as the industry itself evolves.<n><n>To begin, the amount of money consumers are willing to spend per unit on food is lower for food marked “organic” than it is for food marked “conventional.”<n>We find a similar pattern in the USDA’s data on the cost of production.  The difference in the average cost of organic and conventional production is very small – not even half of a penny – $48.30 per 100 pounds versus $48.21 per 100.<n><n>On the other hand, organic prices paid at farmer’s markets are on average 57% higher than prices for conventional produce (see Figure 2).<n><n>### What’s the reason for the price difference?<n><n>### Organic foods cost more on average because consumers are willing to pay additional premiums for the foods.<n><n>The 47% average premium for all organic foods is consistent with the overall market for organic foods: 83% of all US farmland in production received no certified organic practices. Organic sales at farmer’s market would only reflect certified organic crops, not all organic crops. In this case, organic sales at farmer's markets would be the best proxy for the 100% organic premium.<n><n>### **Demand**:<n><n>### Organics are valued for <n><n>### The primary reasons for the organic premium in food are (and for US farmers these reason is that they receive a premium for their organic foods).<n><n>### Response rationale:<n><n>## <n><n>### Input (multiple choice):Which of the following is the most appropriate response to the request to “Write a response that appropriately responds to this scenario.”<n><n>### Demolition:<n><n>### In 20% of cases where children were

The robber notices that the woman is rather large, especially in the abdomen. He says, "Look, lady, you're either going to give me all your money, or I'm going to shoot you and then take your money."  The woman looks at the robber and says,<n>"I'd rather have my purse than be shot. Why don't you shoot me in the legs instead?" The robber thinks this over for a minute and says, "I guess I could do that if I had to."  The woman says, "Here, take my purse; this will be easier for me."  "OK, but when you give me the money, get rid of the gun and drop to your knees," says the robber.  The woman doesn't have a lot of choice and drops to her knees.  She then reaches into her purse, pulls out a pair of handcuffs, cuffs herself and says, "Now, go ahead and shoot me" The robber, puzzled, looks down at the cuffed woman lying on the pavement and the $40 in her hand. He looks around and sees a policeman sitting on the curb watching this event.

Choices:  A: to be heard B: receive gifts C: understand themselves D: good things in life E: acknowledgment<n><n>### Response:		In psychology, counseling (professional counseling in the United States, and counselling or therapy in much of the English-speaking world) is a practice in which practitioners aim to build a trusting relationship with individuals in order to help them handle life difficulties in a more adaptive and positive manner. In many settings, it is considered an art rather than a science, a "profession of the heart", although at times it is clearly a business. Like other health professions, it has been subject to a significant amount of controversy. Some of the main points of controversy are the question of whether those who practice counseling do it more on the basis on humanistic qualities or by means of the evidence-based scientific approach of experimental medicine.<n><n>### Input :<n>I want to find a job as a salesperson in a shop.

Choice D: car show. Since cars are very expensive, it's hard for car owners to pay for the living expense and to maintain the car. Car Shows were only held to show off for the best cars. In addition, they also give out free gifts for the visitors. Visitors can spend most of their times playing with the games and collect their free gifts at the end of the shows. Car shows provide a platform for car owners to show off and collect different gifts and prizes. Car shows are a form of entertainment. A lot of things can be learned about cars from attending car shows. Cars are very expensive, so only rich owners have many car show experiences and know a lot of unique car models. Some people only own one car so they will not know which brand is good or have too many experience attending car shows. The owners of the best cars can get lots of gifts and prizes at the shows. People who can't afford a new car can't get any unique gifts easily.<n><n><n>### Input A farmer has two children born on different days: 1987-04-01 and 1988-04-04.

The Bible is describing events that were important for humankind.  However, many scholars believe the creation of the Earth was probably gradual, and not the result of a single act.  Some believe life has existed on Earth for billions of years.  Humans use fossils to trace the evolution of life.  The theory of evolution states that life evolves through a series of small changes that result in increasing adaptability and complexity.  There are no fossils of a "missing link" that would connect reptiles to mammals.  Many animals and plant species have become extinct, due to a variety of causes, during the 1.8 billion years that the Earth has existed.  A species that has vanished due to human influence is called an endangered species.<n><n>Write an essay that discusses the points of view described in the reading above.<n><n>#### Point:<n>Write: First, point that first paragraph that describe creation of Earth it is a beginning of life.<n>We do not know it how long and how, life began.<n>Next point is describing the Earth.<n>An earth is only a one planet.<n>Furthermore explain of evolution.<n>In the evolution there are no fossils of missing link.<n>Simply it can not find out.<n>There are many species that have become extinct.<n>Endangered species are a species that will be destroyed if we continue using Earth not carefully.<n><n>#### Point 2<n>Write: After point 1 point.<n>Due to the earth, we have a life.<n>Since it will take a long, many years as history of a planet, human beings should love Earth.<n>

Choices:  A: airplane B: ship's hold C: boat D: truck E: train<n><n>### Response:		The fastest but most expensive way to send cargo is through the air by airplane. Shipping by way of a ship's hold or boat is much cheaper. Using a freight truck or train is slower but the least expensive.<n><n>### Explanation: An airplane is the fastest mode of transportation, but the most expensive. A ship's hold is cheaper, but uses the ship to transport it. A boat is expensive and time consuming, but provides the ability to easily transport goods. Trucks are a little more efficient and quicker, but much more expensive than all other options. Trains are cheap while being relatively slower.<n><n>### Input<n>In some states the gasoline tax is about 23.5 cents.  How much money would it cost to fill a very large gasoline tank (300 gallons) in one of their service stations?<n><n>### Response<n>23.5 cts per gallon = $69.75.<n><n>### Question<n>In some states the car-tax rate is 5.1 percent.  What amount would you have to pay to a state on a 40,000-dollar automobile where car taxes are $190 per year?<n><n>### Note<n>40,001 = $190<n><n>### Exemplification<n>In Florida, the state's 6.0 percent overall retail sales tax applies to only a portion of the purchase price of new automobiles.  If the retail price of a car is 14,000 dollars and you can use your trade-in, how much sales tax can you avoid having to pay, and how much will you be required to pay?<n><n>### Input(question)<n>Florida's sales tax applies to 6.0% of the total price on new automobiles. There's a 2.00 % deal on the car's cost, leaving a total of 4.0 to tax. In this scenario, the car costs 14,0.000 dollars.  It costs the buyer (you) 4,000 to buy the car (price of the item) + 0.000 (price of the trade-in) = 8.000 dollars, which is 28.

Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?<n>Rationales: The first 7 days were $190.<n>There were 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 days left.<n>The additional 4 days were 4*30=<<4*30=120>>120.<n>And 190+120=<<190+120=310>>310.<n>#### 310<n>Answer: 310<n><n>Input: A hurricane is approaching the southern coast of Texas, and a rancher is planning to move 400 head of cattle 60 miles to higher ground to protect them from possible inland flooding that might occur.  His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Rationales: Given the limited capacity of his transport vehicle (20 head of cattle), the 400 head of cattle will require 400/20=<<400/20=20>>20 trips using his transport vehicle.<n>Traveling to the site at 60 mph for 60 miles it will take 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour to travel one-way.<n>Since each trip requires driving to and returning from the relocation site, each complete round trip will take 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 hours.<n>Thus, 20 complete trips will take 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 hours of driving time.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Where might someone find old clothing?

The owner of the clothing might have placed the clothing among the shelves.<n>E) An old washing machine (or dryer) might contain clothes that have not been cleaned and folded. Clothing that is torn might be placed in the machine and disposed there. It is possible for old laundry to be trapped in the washer.<n><n>### Demo-based answer:<n>The most likely place for an old t-shirt is a trunk in the attice.<n>An old nightstand or a drawer from a piece of furniture will likely contain old clothes, but probably not in the form of a t-shirt.<n>A suitcase might contain old cloths, but probably not a t-shirt unless it is from an earlier era (say, from high school).<n>A book shelf, while a good storage area for many things, is unlikely to hold a single t-shirt (unless it is very old).<n>A washing machine or dryer is the least likely place to find a t-shirt in that the old clothing is often discarded by the owner to conserve space.<n>#### Trunk<n>#### Book shelf<n><n>### Input/Demo-based answer:<n>An old t-shirt might be found in a trunk in the basement, attic, or elsewhere in your house.<n>Alternatively, a t-shirt might have been thrown away in a washer or dryer and is now stuck inside the old appliance. Since old clothes are usually discarded, the washing machine and dryer are unlikely locations to find an old t-shirts.<n>An old book shelf from your high school or college days might contain old clothing of one sorts or another.<n>However, if a t-shirt is what you are

Choices:  A: drawer B: filing cabinet C: computers D: desk E: filing cabinet<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is:  E: filing cabinet.<n><n>### Explanations: Choice A: Paper files need to be secure and organised in a filing cabinet or office desk - not in the drawers of a desk or filing cabinet. Choice B: A "filing" cabinet organises paper files and can also be used to store other office items. Choice C: Computers do not store paper files; although there are devices called "document management" systems that store paper files digitally, they are much less commonly used. Choice D: Some people use desks to store paper files, but a filing cabinet is much more common.

Choices:  T:  It should not use digital certificates to guarantee the authenticity of the transaction. F:  The bank's online system uses a server certificate. T:  Only the bank has a server certificate. F:  Individuals are also issued server certificates by Certificate Authorities. T:  The certificate authority makes sure that the certificate it issues authenticates the user and the transaction initiator.<n><n>### Response : The correct answer is: T:  It should use digital certificates to authenticate the transaction.  Answer: F<n><n>### Explnation: The bank's online systems use digital certificates to establish the authenticity of the person requesting the transaction, of the person who initiated the transaction and of the transaction itself. The transaction request initiator must supply their public key to the bank's online systems and the bank's online system must compare the transaction requester's public key to the public key included in its SSL/TLS protocol. The person who actually executes the transaction also needs to use a digital certificate. Any malicious third party may use a digital certificate to provide the impression of authenticity if their digital certificate (which could be obtained from the dark web or hacked from the legitimate person) is accepted by the bank's online services. The bank's security policies should require the use of multi-factor authentication in order to use the online services. The server certificate issued by the bank to its online system is validated each time by the online service user, either directly (

From the information provided in the diagram determine answers to the following questions.<n><n>#### Question: Do more or fewer deaths occur in older individuals, who are more likely to smoke, than younger individuals? Explain using details and analysis from the chart and diagram.<n><n>#### Answer: More deaths occur in older than in younger individuals.<n><n>#### Reasoning:  More smokers die every time people die until all who ever smoked are dead.  For example if this were true then every year more and more people who ever smoked would be dead.<n><n>### Where is the overall correlation?<n><n>#### Correlation: Correlation is a statistical term that measures the connection between data items. Positive correlation means that data is likely to increase together and negative correlation indicates that correlation is likely to diminish with increasing values of the variables.<n><n>#### Explain using details, facts, and analysis from the chart.<n><n>#### Answer- A positive correlation based on the information given by the chart.<n><n>### Question: Based on the chart, in which interval is the most deaths recorded due to smoking? In other words, what is the largest group of deaths?<n><n>#### Answer:<n><n>The most deaths due to smoking occur for those whose ages are 35-39.<n><n>### Add a detailed analysis to your answer in the previous question. Your analysis must be at least 10 sentences long. In your analysis, provide specific details and facts.<n><n>#### Analysis: To answer the question in the previous question this would be done by counting all the deaths according to age. This means it would be calculated from 25-39 the ages are 39+35 and add up all the death

How much, in dollars is the manufacturer's incentive?<n><n>### Response<n><n>The correct answer is $50.<n><n>### Additional Information<n><n>Because manufacturer's invoice = manufacturer's list price, this can be rewritten as $$$manufacturer's invoice_{1}=manufacturer's list price_{1}$$ and so $$$manufacturer incentive_{0}=manufacturer list price_{1}$$$ and $$$net cost_{1}=cost_{1}$$ Therefore we have the following equation: $$$net cost_{0}=wholesale price_{1}+manufacturer price_{0}$$$ Using the fact that $$$manufacturer price_{1}=manufacturers incentive_{1}$$ $$$wholesale price_{0}=cost_{0}-incentive_{1}$$$ And $$$wholesale cost=-incentive_{0}=-manufacturers invoice_{0}$$ Finally $$$net cost_{-1}=cost_{-1}-(-incentive_{0})=-cost_{0}$$$ And that is the manufacturer' choice of $$$50$$.<n><n>### Question<n><n>The correct answer above is: A bald eagle is safe in a pine tree.<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>The manufacturers incentive can not be used to subtract to increase the price, so $15 is subtracted from the wholesale price. Then the manufacturer's choice is $50. If they choose $15, then the new car dealer is paying $15 less, or $(cost)$$-(Manufacturer choice)=$$$55$$$. <n>

He lives on his own in the great outdoors.<n><n>## Rationales<n><n>### Answer: the great outdoors<n><n>### Instructor: The question asks, where does the blowfish live?<n><n>### Instantiation: We have to distinguish between two types of living spaces.  One is living with another live thing, like fish lives in the sea, or fish lives with another fish, and the other living space is a human living space, where a human being lives alone in the house, or lives in a group with a group of humans.<n><n>### The blowfish himself lives with his own.  He lives alone in natural environment, in the wild, without any human interaction.<n><n>### Human being would never live in the wild with a blowfish.  Human being only live in human habitats, which are buildings, towns, human settlements, apartment, etc.<n><n>### Therefore, the blowfish lives on free in the great outdoores.<n><n>### Answer Explanation:<n><n>### For an individual human, the person lives on his own.  He does not live with other animals.  He lives with other humans, not animals.  However, an animal has the complete opposite preference.  An animal prefers to live with another animal.<n><n>### Conversely, the blowfish only lives with other blowfish, not humans.  But for a human, they always live with other humans, not blowfish.<n><n>### This is what distinguishes an animal from a human.  Animals live with other animals, and human does not.  Animals like to live in groups, where humans hate to live in groups with other humans.<n><n>## Instant:The ocean has two oxygen-rich areas in it.  One is the surface ocean, and the other is the deep-sea floor.  A human being wants to walk in the ocean, but she should not walk very far, because if she does she may suffocate if there are not enough oxygen in the deep ocean.  She can walk on the surface ocean without a worry of suffocation.  Where is it safe for the human being to walk in the ocean? Choices:  The upper ocean floor is

However, there are many stools in existence, and many things that stunts the legs from being built. One of the more popular stool stunt-stop is the internet, a place where you can type anything and people will agree, so option E: bar is one place where you can't build a strong stool unless you're one of those guys who just needs something to lean on and can't sit down anyways.<n><n>### Input:: The sum of two integers that differ by 1 is: C:6 D:5 E:4 F:2<n><n>### Response:: There might be any amount of possible combinations when dealing with the subject so I'll use 2 and 4: two will be 2+1=3.

The answer should be a whole number.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>First, let us calculate the distance of the two cities with an imaginary straight line.  We used the distance calculator from the US Census Bureau:<n>-From: https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/maps/Distance_Maps_and_Territory_Files.html<n><n>Distance between the two cities is: 331 miles.<n>-From: https//www.google.com/maps/dir//Pittsburgh,+PA/Washington,+DC/@39.959116,-79.9779981,7z/data=!3m1!4b1<n><n>To prove the answer is correct, it seems only fair to see if there is a logical explanation as to why Washington DC and not Pittsburgh is on the opposite end of the calculation.<n><n>The logical answer would imply that Pittsburgh Pennsylvania is further from Washington DC than the opposite distance would imply, but as the calculator suggests that is not the case.  It is safe to assume that the calculator is right.<n><n>The actual length in feet is 3,317,894 ft.<n>It was concluded that Billy is inside the house somewhere near the ball.<n><n>#### A.E<n><n>### Question How many times will a quarter cost the same when compared to half a quarter in the long run?<n><n>### Rationales<n>In the beginning, all your money will be in change coins.

By the time the sales tax went into effect, the price of the car had increased to $28,000.  The sales tax rate is 5.5 percent.  What amount of new tax dollars came out of your account as a result of this sales tax. Round the answer to the nearest dollar.<n>### Rationales: For every $1.00 spent, a buyer pays $1.05.  When a tax of 5.5% is added to the cost of a purchase, it is equal to 5.5% of a product's selling price, regardless of how much that product costs.<n>Therefore we multiply the selling price by the tax rate in order to get the amount of tax.<n>Because $28,080. 50=$28080.50=>$25,005  * 0.055 = 1426.25 dollars.<n>###<n>#### Answer<n><n>Answer: 1426<n><n>### Instraction:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Instuction:The price of a brand-new car was $29,000. After the sales tax went into  effect, the price of a car increased to $29,100. The sales tax rate is $0.63 per $100. For each $1.00, a buyer pays an additional $0.063. How much additional tax was paid after the new price was enacted?<n>## Solution:1) When an item costs $1.00 the tax is $0.60 so the cost is $1.60<n><n>```<n>2)$29000*(1-0.2)=$8600<n>3)$8600*1.063= $8938.18<n>4) Therefore, $8938 + $8938 = $166,976.16<n>```<n><n>#### Answer:<n>Answer:1

Choices:  A: crash B: living C: slow down D: carry people E: speed up<n><n>### Response:		C: slow down<n><n>### Explain:<n>A cabin refers to a place or area on a ship or plane that passengers can stay temporarily while on those types of vehicles.<n>Typically, a cabin on a plane is a small room with a door to protect passengers from loud, turbulent air and to keep others in the cabin. Sometimes the cabin does not have its own door, and the entrance to the cabins of most planes open just in front of the passenger seats.<n>Cabins on commercial planes are small and are only made for passengers, so they are also the only quiet places in the planes when the passengers are seated. It is not the purpose of a cabin to slow down a vehicle, though the purpose is to protect passengers from harmful noise and weather during flight.<n><n><n>### In a survey of 11 college students, 6% listed math as their favorite subject, 21% listed reading as their favorite subject, and 55% listed nothing.

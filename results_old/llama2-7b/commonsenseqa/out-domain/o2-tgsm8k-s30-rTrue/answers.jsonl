{"text": "A: carpet\n\n### Rationale:  The word that should be placed in the blank is \"fridge\", because the leftovers were old, covered in mold, and had been forgotten for an extended period of time. Therefore the word that would follow the phrase \"in the (blank) was\" is \"fridge\". The other words wouldn't make sense because of the following reason. If a carpet has forgotten leftovers, it doesn't make sense to have a mold growing on it. The refrigerator is another appliance where people store food they don't want to eat that day, but food does not grow mold on it. If bread grows mold on it, then they store it in a breadbox, not a regular box, because the breadbox is designed for bread. If it is old, it is because it isn't being eaten, not because it is growing \"gross mold\". The coach is too large to fit in back of, the breadbox needs to be small enough to fit inside the kitchen. The forgotten leftovers were forgotten because they were old, and old means moldy. The fridge is the only place for food to stay fresh, so if the leftovers have mold, then they must be in the fridge. A person would not put old, forgotten leftovers in a regular box.\n\n### Further information:\n\nhttps://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/multiple-choice-interpreting-phrases.html", "answer": "B: refrigerator"}

Choices A through E has some relevance but it\u2019s confusing.\n\n### \n\n\n### Recommendation:\nWe recommend you focus on writing your answer for the two following exercises:\n\n1. The task is described as below:\n\n1.1. Demonstration: Your company's product manager asked you to create a visualization showing the average price-per-month of a mobile phone plan versus the month that the plan was purchased for a recent large customer. Write a response that accurately answers the request.\n\n1. Rationales: The task below is asking for you to identify two relevant dimensions in the data. The dimensions of time and price will be useful for analyzing the pricing data.   Once a relevant dimension is identified in the data, it would be helpful to find some way to encode this dimension into the visualization to show both a graph and an explanation of the data.  The data could be encoded as a bar graph or line graph, using the dimension to determine the height or length, respectively.   A scatterplot, or other types of chart, could also be used to show the same data. Annotations should be clear and explanatory by describing the dimension, the specific data for the dimension, and an explanation of the trend or significance of results found.\n\n1.1 Answer the following multiple choice question\n\n1. For a project in the office, your manager has asked you to examine the sales of the local company's product in one city.

{"text": "A\n\n### Rationale for response:\nThe energy stored as potential energy in your muscles can be released in many different ways, depending on a variety of factors. The energy stored as potential energy, which is the type of energy that can be easily harnessed and converted into kinetic energy, can be released in your muscles for motion and action when you move, when you think and reason, when you communicate, when you shout, when you concentrate, and even when you sit and breathe.\n\nHowever, this energy is not mainly released during exercise, and is more likely to be released in ways not readily visible to you. Your body performs other physical activities (such as digestion) even while you are not doing much physical activity. In addition, your body maintains homeostasis \u2014 a range of bodily functions that you have control over, such as heart rate, body temperature, and other physiological factors. So while exercise may primarily release stored energy as kinetic energy into your muscles for movement, other physical activity still produces physical energy, but not necessarily the same kinetic energy produced by exercise.\n\n#### Answer: A\n\n### Input :  An object falls toward the center of the earth.

They ask a local where the line for United is located;  the man shows them the way.  At the front of the line, they wait.  Suddenly the man realizes that he has left his driver's license back on the plane they arrived on only half a mile away; his wife doesn't remember taking it but the man feels certain that she did.  He dashes away to return to the plane.  His wife waits in line.  When she reaches the front of the line after only two minutes, an angry passenger turns to her and snarls. \"Don't you know to wait your turn, dear?\"\n###### Rationales:\nThe man returned to the plane to retrieve his driver's license.  His wife went to the airport from the plane the man arrived at.   Two minutes was the amount of time it took her to wait in line, and after two minutes the angry passenger turned to her, so she waited no more than three minutes total.\n####", "answer": "C: antipathy"}

So the time for all the trips is 400*2 or $800 hours.\n\nThe correct answer is $800.\n\nThe question is incorrect. The question says that the destination is 60 miles away. The question says that there is a 60 miles/hour limit in the journey. This means that the time for this journey is 60/6*2=60 hours.\n\nThis means two day journey.\n\nIf there are $20$ head and the total time is $600$ hours then the number of trips is $20/60=3$ trips.\n\n$3*60$ is 180 hours. And 180 hours/2 hours is 90 trips.", "answer": "B: fairgrounds"}

You need a boolean variable to check the word as a token or not. If it is not a token, then you need to write down the token as an array. This way you will know whether it is a sentence or not. Create another for loop to iterate though the array. If a token is matched or not, you need to write a code to replace it for the next iteration.

{"text": "Answer:\nThere are several things you can do. You can hold a protest (riot), which would change peoples opinions of you. You can try to get enough people to vote for you so that you gain social activism (getting the people in the government to change the law for what you want). Changing yourself (changing your personality to what you think people in society want) is the hardest way to go about it. Even if you do everything as well as you can you would still have to have the people of society willing to listen to you. But you do not need to convince everyone. You need a small percentage of the people in the society.

In which sequence will you be least likely to run into him?  Choices A: Up, Up, Down  B: Up, Up, Up C: Down, Up, Down  D: Up, Down, Up  E: Down, Down, Down\n\n###  Rationales:\nTo reach the base, you must first arrive at your starting point\nThen, go Down, then Up.  The Down-then-Up scenario is the most dangerous, because you'll be least likely to see your uncle during the transition.\nThus, B and D are not among your best choices.\n\nIf you choose A, you'll most assuredly arrive (at the base) before your uncle does.\nYet, if you arrive before him, you'll need to descend the stairs again after he has, which means that you'll either go Up-and-Down, or Down-and-Up.\nThat doesn't appear to be the best plan.\nSimilarly, if you choose C, you'll arrive (at the base), but if you arrive first, it's not clear how you can reach the bottom before him.  Perhaps you can simply stay at the very top level of the stairs until he arrives, then descend, and (assuming no interruptions) meet him at the base. If, however, he gets there first it seems that he can simply continue down to the base-of-stairs and you'd be unable to escape in time.\nThis means, that C is not among your best choices either.\nYou can do no better than if you choose B and D or if you choose E\n\n###  Answer: E\n\n### Exponential growth problem:\nAn initial investment of $2000 grows to $$12001.43$$ after 2 years.

{"text": "Option D: store\n\n#### Explanation:The store contains various sections- one of which includes alcohol and fried, delicious and healthy food. For example, alcohol can be available in the form of wine, vodka and cognac. Fried items, on the other hand, can be represented by the following: French fries, onion rings, chips and wings. As a matter of fact, fries combined with wings can be considered as fried foods. Moreover, wings are considered to be alcohol. Alcoholic beverages are further divided into red and white wine. The store consists of other sections as well, for instance: deli. All-inclusive, the fried foods will be available in a separate section since, for example, they're fried and, thus, would fall beneath the description of 'healthy food'.\n\n### Input:(Tenting) I'd like to make arrangements where I may purchase tents, any suggestions?\n----------\n### Demonstraction:\n\n#### 1) Choices: A: sleeping bags B: backpacks C: sleeping tents\n\n#### 2) Choices: D: cotton tents\n\n#### Explanaton:\nA) Sleeping bags provide warmth, so they may be considered tentless tents, in some case. Backpacks are used only to carry objects.\nB) Sleeping tents are an item of a group- tents, they serve the purpose of housing while on the go.\n\nC) Sleeping tetns are also considered to be tents; tents, in this case, could act as shelter while being on the camp.\n\nD) Cotton tents are, in some cases, a tent less tent or a tent like sleeping bag. This is due to the cotton fabric. However, cotton tents are meant to act as shelter. This means that the cotton tents represent tents, not sleeping tents.\n\n#### Explanotion:\nTo make arrangements to purchase tents, go to the tent store. Also, tents are available in a separate section of the store. As a matter of face, tents are classified as shelter, so they should be located in the section that offers shelter (tents), in turn, making the tent store", "answer": "A: pub"}

What we want to find out is how many words of what length can be formed the letters in TEENAGER. \n\nTEENAGER has 8 letters, so the largest words we can form has 8 letters. We have 5 vowels, so the words we form can have less than 5 vowels. So, our starting point in the formation of the word is to use **exactly 5 vowels and exactly 3 consonants**. \n\nThen, we put the vowels in the word. The next step is to use each consonant exactly once, but this is easy, because the vowels have already been fixed. We now need to determine how many times each consonant can be used in the word. It is very simple, because once a consonant has been used 5 times, the next vowel has to be used as the 6th letter of the word. But, this makes things simple as we just have to count the frequency of the occurrence of each, and in the list below, I've added the frequency how often we repeat each set of the 5 consonants.\n\nLet's try it out. \n\n1. Once, A\n2. Once, E\n3. Twice, I\n4. Once, O\n5. Once, U\n6. Only once more, 5 in all\n\nWe can clearly see that we can make a total of 6 different words, if we include the 6th word which will use all the existing letters in the word TEEENAGER.\n\nSince the vowels cannot be repeated, we can only use one vowel each.", "answer": "B: irritation"}

In a department store where the customer purchases the DVD player, the rate of sales tax is 5.75% (the state sales tax) plus a 12% (the department stores' sales tax). How much would the DVD player cost with the state sales tax applied to the DVD player and the department stores' sales tax applied to the total cost?\n\n### Rationale\nIf the price is $159.00, the department stores' sales is $18.00.\nAnd \n5.75+12+18=<<5.75+ 12+18>>27.75.\nThus, the total cost with the department stores' sales applied to the total cost = $18.027.75 = 372.95.\n\nAnswer=373\n\n### Input How would you describe a positive rational number?", "answer": "E: earth"}

One way to arrange these glasses in a single row is with a green glass in the middle and two glasses of the same color on either side. Another way to arrange the glasses is to alternate sides, but always arrange them so that there is a different color at the end. If the glasses are randomly distributed around the room, which two colors are most likely to appear next to each other?\nRationales:(16)(0.75)(0)(x)\nIn the first case, since there are only 4 pairs and the rule is to have a colour of the left and a colour of the right, we have options left or right with the colours blue, yellow, red then green.\nIn the second case, we have 4 possibilities left and right, but we know the order. So if we start from the first left (right, left, left, left, right) there is only room for 4 options and they must be alternating. We can eliminate the last option and the other possibilities are left or right (alternating or not) with the colours (blue, yellow, red, blue).\nThe right colour at the beginning is not likely to appear at the right end at the end.\nOption D\nAnswer: \n\nInput: The diagram shown represents a network.

{"text": "The correct answer is \"A\".\nCompetent students should do well both academically and socially. It does not make sense for competent students to do \"avoid pain\" since they should be confident in themselves and will have received good marks and compliments already, thus, they should be enjoying school. If students do poorly in school or get low marks it shows that they are not competent in their area of work.\n\n\n### Input 2: What would a person expect if he's just following his parents' expectations? Choices: A: good grades B: avoid pain C: intellectual challenge D. compliments E: passing grade\n\n### Response 2:\nThe correct answer for this is \"D\". This can be explained by the fact that a student should have a different and different set of expectations to his parent's expectations. As parents provide students with basic needs - food, clothing and shelter -, students should develop their minds and think for themselves rather than just doing things as expected from their parents. For example, students may be given money by their parents in order to purchase something. However, if a student is to spend the money at a certain place then it would defeat the purpose of giving the student money. Similarly if students would get low marks from their subjects then they could not fulfil their parent's expectations of them. However, if the student was competent in his/her work then parents should be proud of their children, giving then compliments.\n\n### Input\nWhat is the correct punctuation for the sentence \"I can play soccer, football, badminton and swim\"?\n\n### Response\nThe correct answer will be \"A\". This is because of the fact that this sentence is an interrogative sentence and the question mark should be present to show the interrogation. Another sentence that could be written as a sentence is \"I know it was you who stole the bag\". This sentence is also correct by itself. So the correct sentence should be \"I can play socer, football, badmintnon, and swim!\n\n\n### Instrucion\nWhat would two or more digits in the same position of a repeating decimal equal?

{"text": "This is an analogy question:\n\nThe analogy between the files transferring through the computer network and files traveling on a freeway is that if two cars travel on the same lane of a one lane car the road they will share the lane. The car traveling on the right side will move to the left hand side of the lane to let the car traveling on the left side pass. If the car traveling on ther right side move fast and the car on the left side is move slow, it will take more time for the car traveling on right side to let the car travel on the left side. When they are done, the car passing will also return to its right side. In conclusion they share the same lane and that is the relationship between the wires and the electrical circuit.\n\n### Input\nAnswer the following multiple choice on the question: How should you interpret the following sentence of prose? \"The dog ran away and its house was destroyed.\" The answer will either be on the question:\n\n1. A: The dog did not eat the house it ran away.\n2. B: If the dog is not in the house, it should not be in the house now.\n\n### Response\nThe correct answer is number 2 but not 1.\n\nAnswer: 1. Dog did not eat the house, it ran away.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe house is referred to in the past tense, which represents its state.\nThe dog is in one sentence (The dog has been found by his master) and eats the house in another sentence(The dog destroyed the house) if the dog had eaten the house then there would be no house left. Dog and house destroyed are past tense so dog ate the house means that dog can not be in the house because dog was destroyed.\n\n**The house did not eat the dog therefore there was dog in the house.**\n\nAnswer:2. If the dog is not house then the dog is not with its master and should not be in the dog house.\n\nExplanation:\nIn question:\nThe dog ran away from the house.\nThe house was destroyed in a fire.\nTherefore if the dog ran away then it should not be in its house now. Dog's house is destroyed means it is not in its house that means it ran away.\nDog that", "answer": "D: computer network"}

{"text": "E, farmer's market.\n\n### Response Rationale:\n\n### Demand:\n\n### Roughly 40% of US consumers don't trust food labeled \u201corganic\u201d, according to a recent survey by Consumer Reports. As a result, the USDA organic label is increasingly valuable in the marketplace, and its requirements are evolving as the industry itself evolves.\n\nTo begin, the amount of money consumers are willing to spend per unit on food is lower for food marked \u201corganic\u201d than it is for food marked \u201cconventional.\u201d\nWe find a similar pattern in the USDA\u2019s data on the cost of production.  The difference in the average cost of organic and conventional production is very small \u2013 not even half of a penny \u2013 $48.30 per 100 pounds versus $48.21 per 100.\n\nOn the other hand, organic prices paid at farmer\u2019s markets are on average 57% higher than prices for conventional produce (see Figure 2).\n\n### What\u2019s the reason for the price difference?\n\n### Organic foods cost more on average because consumers are willing to pay additional premiums for the foods.\n\nThe 47% average premium for all organic foods is consistent with the overall market for organic foods: 83% of all US farmland in production received no certified organic practices. Organic sales at farmer\u2019s market would only reflect certified organic crops, not all organic crops. In this case, organic sales at farmer's markets would be the best proxy for the 100% organic premium.\n\n### **Demand**:\n\n### Organics are valued for \n\n### The primary reasons for the organic premium in food are (and for US farmers these reason is that they receive a premium for their organic foods).\n\n### Response rationale:\n\n## \n\n### Input (multiple choice):Which of the following is the most appropriate response to the request to \u201cWrite a response that appropriately responds to this scenario.\u201d\n\n### Demolition:\n\n### In 20% of cases where children were", "answer": "B: woods"}

In many settings, it is considered an art rather than a science, a \"profession of the heart\", although at times it is clearly a business. Like other health professions, it has been subject to a significant amount of controversy. Some of the main points of controversy are the question of whether those who practice counseling do it more on the basis on humanistic qualities or by means of the evidence-based scientific approach of experimental medicine.\n\n### Input :\nI want to find a job as a salesperson in a shop.

{"text": "The fastest but most expensive way to send cargo is through the air by airplane. Shipping by way of a ship's hold or boat is much cheaper. Using a freight truck or train is slower but the least expensive.\n\n### Explanation: An airplane is the fastest mode of transportation, but the most expensive. A ship's hold is cheaper, but uses the ship to transport it. A boat is expensive and time consuming, but provides the ability to easily transport goods. Trucks are a little more efficient and quicker, but much more expensive than all other options. Trains are cheap while being relatively slower.\n\n### Input\nIn some states the gasoline tax is about 23.5 cents.  How much money would it cost to fill a very large gasoline tank (300 gallons) in one of their service stations?\n\n### Response\n23.5 cts per gallon = $69.75.\n\n### Question\nIn some states the car-tax rate is 5.1 percent.  What amount would you have to pay to a state on a 40,000-dollar automobile where car taxes are $190 per year?\n\n### Note\n40,001 = $190\n\n### Exemplification\nIn Florida, the state's 6.0 percent overall retail sales tax applies to only a portion of the purchase price of new automobiles.  If the retail price of a car is 14,000 dollars and you can use your trade-in, how much sales tax can you avoid having to pay, and how much will you be required to pay?\n\n### Input(question)\nFlorida's sales tax applies to 6.0% of the total price on new automobiles. There's a 2.00 % deal on the car's cost, leaving a total of 4.0 to tax. In this scenario, the car costs 14,0.000 dollars.  It costs the buyer (you) 4,000 to buy the car (price of the item) + 0.000 (price of the trade-in) = 8.000 dollars, which is 28.", "answer": "A: airplane"}

T:  Only the bank has a server certificate. F:  Individuals are also issued server certificates by Certificate Authorities. T:  The certificate authority makes sure that the certificate it issues authenticates the user and the transaction initiator.\n\n### Response : The correct answer is: T:  It should use digital certificates to authenticate the transaction.  Answer: F\n\n### Explnation: The bank's online systems use digital certificates to establish the authenticity of the person requesting the transaction, of the person who initiated the transaction and of the transaction itself. The transaction request initiator must supply their public key to the bank's online systems and the bank's online system must compare the transaction requester's public key to the public key included in its SSL/TLS protocol. The person who actually executes the transaction also needs to use a digital certificate. Any malicious third party may use a digital certificate to provide the impression of authenticity if their digital certificate (which could be obtained from the dark web or hacked from the legitimate person) is accepted by the bank's online services. The bank's security policies should require the use of multi-factor authentication in order to use the online services.

{"text": "A: The correct answer is \"A: pine tree\"\n\n### Input\n\nThe new car dealer has a used car for which the net cost of the vehicle equals the sum of the vehicle's wholesale price and the vehicle's manufacturer incentive.  How much, in dollars is the manufacturer's incentive?\n\n### Response\n\nThe correct answer is $50.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nBecause manufacturer's invoice = manufacturer's list price, this can be rewritten as $$$manufacturer's invoice_{1}=manufacturer's list price_{1}$$ and so $$$manufacturer incentive_{0}=manufacturer list price_{1}$$$ and $$$net cost_{1}=cost_{1}$$ Therefore we have the following equation: $$$net cost_{0}=wholesale price_{1}+manufacturer price_{0}$$$ Using the fact that $$$manufacturer price_{1}=manufacturers incentive_{1}$$ $$$wholesale price_{0}=cost_{0}-incentive_{1}$$$ And $$$wholesale cost=-incentive_{0}=-manufacturers invoice_{0}$$ Finally $$$net cost_{-1}=cost_{-1}-(-incentive_{0})=-cost_{0}$$$ And that is the manufacturer' choice of $$$50$$.\n\n### Question\n\nThe correct answer above is: A bald eagle is safe in a pine tree.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe manufacturers incentive can not be used to subtract to increase the price, so $15 is subtracted from the wholesale price. Then the manufacturer's choice is $50. If they choose $15, then the new car dealer is paying $15 less, or $(cost)$$-(Manufacturer choice)=$$$55$$$.", "answer": "D: wildlife refuge"}

Human being only live in human habitats, which are buildings, towns, human settlements, apartment, etc.\n\n### Therefore, the blowfish lives on free in the great outdoores.\n\n### Answer Explanation:\n\n### For an individual human, the person lives on his own.  He does not live with other animals.  He lives with other humans, not animals.  However, an animal has the complete opposite preference.  An animal prefers to live with another animal.\n\n### Conversely, the blowfish only lives with other blowfish, not humans.  But for a human, they always live with other humans, not blowfish.\n\n### This is what distinguishes an animal from a human.  Animals live with other animals, and human does not.

By the time the sales tax went into effect, the price of the car had increased to $28,000.  The sales tax rate is 5.5 percent.  What amount of new tax dollars came out of your account as a result of this sales tax. Round the answer to the nearest dollar.\n### Rationales: For every $1.00 spent, a buyer pays $1.05.  When a tax of 5.5% is added to the cost of a purchase, it is equal to 5.5% of a product's selling price, regardless of how much that product costs.\nTherefore we multiply the selling price by the tax rate in order to get the amount of tax.\nBecause $28,080. 50=$28080.50=>$25,005  * 0.055 = 1426.25 dollars.\n###\n#### Answer\n\nAnswer: 1426\n\n### Instraction:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Instuction:The price of a brand-new car was $29,000.

How much additional tax was paid after the new price was enacted?\n## Solution:1) When an item costs $1.00 the tax is $0.60 so the cost is $1.60\n\n```\n2)$29000*(1-0.2)=$8600\n3)$8600*1.063= $8938.18\n4) Therefore, $8938 + $8938 = $166,976.16\n```\n\n#### Answer:\nAnswer:1", "answer": "D: having fun"}

{"text": "C: slow down\n\n### Explain:\nA cabin refers to a place or area on a ship or plane that passengers can stay temporarily while on those types of vehicles.\nTypically, a cabin on a plane is a small room with a door to protect passengers from loud, turbulent air and to keep others in the cabin. Sometimes the cabin does not have its own door, and the entrance to the cabins of most planes open just in front of the passenger seats.\nCabins on commercial planes are small and are only made for passengers, so they are also the only quiet places in the planes when the passengers are seated. It is not the purpose of a cabin to slow down a vehicle, though the purpose is to protect passengers from harmful noise and weather during flight.\n\n\n### In a survey of 11 college students, 6% listed math as their favorite subject, 21% listed reading as their favorite subject, and 55% listed nothing.

If his weekly budget for meals is $96, what is his budget for clothes? Choices:  (round off to the nearest cent).\n\n### Response : In this situation, if the answer is A, enter the amount (10) and the rational as 'true'. If the answer is B, enter the amount (-96) and the rational as false. If the answer is C (50.50) enter the answer and the rational as true.\n\n### Rationales:\nA\nThe weekly budget of $96 for meals is $10 less than the weekly budget of $106 for clothes\n\nB\n$500-$96=<<$500-$106=96>>96 is the extra dollars left over after spending 106 on clothes\n\nC\n50.50  is correct (the nearest cent)\n\n### Input :-Which of the following two statements has an error or omission? 1st Sentence: <<1st sentence>>In mathematics, the definition of prime numbers says that there's no other positive integer that matches the criteria for a prime number if the prime number is less than 2.

(v feet per minute.) Assume that all the cars of the train have the same speed.\n\n    Which of the following is true for the number of minutes it takes to travel a distance d feet?\n      A The speed of the train is d ft per minute.\n      B The speed of the train plus all of the cars exceeds d ft per minute. \n      C The speed of the train exceeds the sum of all the cars times d feet per minute.\n      D The speed of the train times the number of cars is d ft per minute\n\n### Rationale: The train's engine is travelling at a constant speed of _20ft/minute_ and the other cars that's following it is travelling at a _constant speed of_ (v feet per minute), so the answer to choice C is not true, because the sum of the speed of all the cars times the number of cars does not exceed the speed of the engine + the speed of the car, therefore option b is false. The speed of the train + all the cars does not exceed the distance of d feet per minute, so b is false again. Option a is false because the speed of the train is not the sum of the cars and distance. The speed of the other cars times the number of feet per minute does not exceed the speed the train, so d is false too; option d is not true.\n\n### Answer: All of the other responses are false, so the correct response is C.\n\n### Rationales: Speed of train = 20mph + _v feet per minute_ = _20mph + v feet per minute_ Speed of all cars = _\u2211 (v feet per minute)_ = _\u2211 _v feet per minute]_\nSpeed of all cars exceeding = _\u2211 _(v feet per minute) x d feet per minute_ \n= _\u2211 _(v x d feet per minute)_ Exceeds = _", "answer": "D: own home"}

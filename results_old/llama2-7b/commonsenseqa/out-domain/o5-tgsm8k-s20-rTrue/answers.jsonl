Based on the information provided, what is her total monthly expenses?\n\n### Solution Summary:\n\nIf we want to get the total expenses, we first need to know how much we are spending on entertainment and travel. Her monthly income is 4000. Let's say she spends 600 at entertainment and 1000 for travel. We need to multiple 1.3 (it is 30% of 4000) for entertainment and 1.5 for travel. Then the total spending is 600 (1.3*4000) + 1500 (1.5*1000) = 7500/12 = <<7500/30=250>>250.\n\n### Solution:\n\nIf we let A = 600, x = 4000, and y = 1000.\nThen: A + B + C = I  and  A + B = T\nThe equation for the entertainment spending is:  30% * A = 0.3 * A = 0 <<18=18>>18 for entertainment = 600 \nA = 400  and B = 600 + 600\nWe then have:   20% * 4000 = 0.2 * 400 * 400 = 0 <<80=80>>80 for travel = 1500\nC =   y + A = 100 + 6(400) = 100+2400 = 150 T, which is travel.\nNow, we combine the like terms for entertainment:  600 + 150 + 60 =  0.3 * A + B = 660\nSimplifying the result from combining like terms gives us:  3", "answer": "D: pet shops"}

The second statement refers to your 2 year old child, so you should take them to the doctor. The child has a headache, you wouldn't take them to the hospital. This rules out option #2 and #4. The third statement says that you can't \"control\" your child's headache, not that you can't prevent the headache (in fact it states you cannot prevent the headache). This rules out option #3. The last statement says that children can take medicines (aspirin in this case) without talking to their doctor, so this rules out option #5. Therefore, the correct answer is option #4.\n\n### Option #1\nA: You shouldn't worry (if you have a headache) B: You should take your child (to a doctor) C: You cannot prevent (your child from having a headaches) D: You should never give your (child) an aspirin E: You should talk to your doctors\n\n*1 answer is incorrect\n\n\n### Exercise #2: Answer the following multiple choice question: \n\n### Demos:\nThe dog ate my paper", "answer": "A: headache"}

At the end of the last shift, one of the workers, John, was late by 4 minutes and 3 seconds and was told by the shift leader that he would be docked a week\u2019s pay. Another worker, Jim, was late by 10 minutes, 20 seconds. You asked Jim why John\u2019s delay didn\u2019t cost him a week\u2019s pay and he said that Jim\u2019s delay was more than a quarter of an hour whereas John\u2019s was only about one-thirtieth that long. Explain why you could decide to dock Jim a week\u2019s pay, too.\n\n### Response\n\nAssuming that one minute is equal to 60 / 10 (seconds), 10 minutes = 600 seconds, 10 minutes =\n600 seconds. Since Jim worked for 10 minutes, we get:\n\n300 - 600 = 300\n \nWe can also assume that 15 minutes = 900 seconds = 15 minute delay.\nThus, Jim's delay was 15 minute which is about half the delay done by John.\nTherefore, he must also be given a week's pay deduction for being late for work.\n\n### Rationale\nInput: You\u2019ve been hI\u2019ve been hired I\u2019ve been hired\n\nInput: You\u2019re a member of a committee that reviews applications to an online university.

{"text": "A and B\n\n### Demostration:\nRich people have been defined as those who have a net worth of more than $1 million. One of the most important traits among rich people is a desire for independence. This independence can manifest itself in many ways, but we know that having lots of money and staying very fit are both manifestations of independence.\n\nWe know that the trait of independence leads rich people to eating bagels. However, not all rich people eat bagels every day - some only do so once or twice a month. What\u2019s more, rich people often have different preferences for their bagels than non-rich people. For example, they generally don\u2019t like extra-strong flavors, yet they do like their bagels to have less salt than their non-rich counterparts.\n\nWhen rich people do like bagels, they tend to like them plain. Those who enjoy their bagels for breakfast usually eat them toasted, while those who want bagels in the middle of their afternoon do so with butter. As for those who like their bagels when they\u2019re hungry at night time, they prefer their bagels slightly toasted \u2013 again, with butter.\n\nRich people have been reported to feel better when they eat bagels with their morning coffee, but because of their busy schedules, they often don\u2019t eat their morning meal until it\u2019s been at least an hour after waking up or working out.\n\nTo summarize, when it comes to having a meal of bagels during the day, rich people generally don\u2019t like their meals being very large at all.\n\n### Rationales:\nRich people who eat bagels tend to have a tendency to dislike extra-strong flavors. Rich people\u2019s tendency to dislike strong flavors means that rich people more frequently eat bagels that aren\u2019t as flavorful. Rich people, however, are able to eat bagels that aren't very salty, which leads them being more likely to buy bagels that have slightly less salt than their non rich counterparts and eat them with butter or with their morning coffee or working out.\nBecause rich people tend to dislike large morning meals, it is likely that when they decide on the time of day they want a bagel meal, they tend to feel better when eating a bagel for their morning meal", "answer": "C: plain"}

If both stores have the same supply of pumpkins and gourds, why weren\u2019t the prices the same for both types of plants?\nAnswer: If the prices of each were the same, they would be $7 and $9.48 for pumpkins, and $7 and $8.97 for gourds.

{"text": "C  \nThe first thing to find out is if an activity is necessary. This is often related to basic survival or to our health and well-being. Next we consider if the activity is a source of inspiration, answers, or love. Finally, we ask if whatever activity is necessary, answers, inspiring, or in some way motivating to us. If we found what we are doing to be necessary, inspiring, or motivating, it becomes fun and we choose to do it again and again.\n\n\n\n### Input 2:Anna is going backpacking for 2 weeks. She is going on a hike for 3 days, a canoe trip for 4 days, and a jeep trip for 1 day.

If it is necessary (to live healthy and function properly in our society), then the activity becomes motivating for us and then turns into fun. In the hike, canoe trip and jeep trip, Anna is traveling in the wilderness which is outside of our society. It takes a necessary and potentially dangerous journey to leave our civilized society and see the wild things in the outdoors. To do this Anna must have a way of traveling on the wilderness trails. The hike has a few miles that only require walking. This may be necessary, but it is not motivating. This is not what the hike is about, but you have to start somewhere. The hike is the way we get to the next portion of this trip, the canoe trip. The canoe trip is what we want to do for inspiration and so that we are motivated for the fun trip that follows it. To get to the canoe trip, Anna has to take a motorized trail where a motorized vehicle is necessary. To go off the main trail or trail system, there is no safe way to do this but by hiking, walking, which is necessary and gets us motivated. Now we are ready for the canoe trip because of the wilderness area and the fun we had on the hike. And so it turns into 2 days.

Look for ways to attack your opponent's king. 4. If you have an extra queen piece, try to checkmate your opponent's queen within a short time. 5. If you have an advantage or an opportunity, use it. 6. If none of the above works, then look for another strategy.\u201d What is the 5th strategy that Cindy's aunt wrote about?\n\n### Response : C: take pieces from your opponents\n\n### Instictions:Input: When Alice and Billy were playing chess, Alice was ahead 3 pieces. She noticed that her checkers were not doing well. Alice said, \u201cOh, look! I am in check.

Check means that all the pieces have to move or you will lose.\nA check must be answered by moving a piece, otherwise a player is in checkmate (this is often a fatal position). A player can choose to move anything but the King. If the king is in check, the player is said to be \u201cin check\u201d\n\n### Response A: Alice was in Checkmate\n\n### Instinctions:Input: Dad likes to play chess when he watches TV.

So the inequality in the second inequality must be true if the first one is true, so we need more than 25 cents to balance the 42 \u03c0.

Edison, on the other hand, seemed only amused by Tesla's hostility. Edison and his partner, George Westinghouse, worked to make electrical lighting the law of the land.

Thus, this equation is: p = $<<$175*($(x/t)+r))>>175*((x/t) + r).\n\nEquation 2: In this equation, t = 17 and p = $1.82. Substituting in Equation 1 for x/t, we get: p = (1.82/17)/$1,75*((x/$17)) + r, where r = 1.82 \u2013 1.75 = 3/175, or 0.01739.

There are 3.\nx = <<x=11>>18\nSince total weekend costs is not available, we can use the fact that x is a non-negative number.\nIf x = 0, we have 10 available to spend on Monday. Since x is greater than 0, the user does not want to spend all 10 on Monday. Thus x < 10.\nIf x = x < 10, we have 8 available to spend on Tuesday. Since x is greater or equal to, but not equal to, 8, the user does not only want to spend 8 dollars on Tuesday. Thus x <= 8.\nIf x = <= 8, we have 5 available to spend on Wednesday.

{"text": "We can help our economy by keeping the federal deficit in check, which can help fight inflation. Sometimes inflation is more of an inconvenience to society than a true problem.\n\n### Difficulty: Medium\n\n### Input and Instruction Above\n\nInput: How many ways can 9 pigs divide the 24 apples that are their total?\n\nDemonstration:\n\nWays to solve this question:\n1. There are 3 pigs and 3 times that it can evenly share between the 3 pigs. This would be 12 apples. If one pig was over, the other two pigs would be at 4 apiece(9: 4:3) This is 24/3= <<24/3=8>>8 times. If two pigs were over, the last pig would be at 3 apples (9: 2:1) This is 21/2=<<21/2=10+1>>10 and half times\n2. There are 12 apples in total. You can use 9 3 times(9: 3: 3).  These are 36/3=<<36/3=12>>12 times. You can then use 6 2 times: (9: 6:3) these are 18/2=<<18/2=9+1>>9 and half times. If you count the number of ways you can use each apple then it is 9 1 times. These would take 3 times 3 apples to finish. So these are 9 3 times. Taking into account one apple per each pig, if these were 12 pigs, the pigs with the smallest number of apples would have to take two 1 times to finish. Which is 18 1 times. There aren't any leftovers when considering all possibilities.\n\n### Choice A: You know the deficit is not evenly balanced if it is equal to or greater than, in the U.S., 1/20 times yearly revenue.\n\nChoice B: You know the defecit is not evenly distributed when its increase or lack of decrease is greater than or equal to 1/2", "answer": "B: not noticeable"}

K: A bivalve is a class of mollusc that has a hinged shell with two parts. L: Bivalves release plankton in order to breathe through plankton.\n\n### Response:#1\n\n### Instrument:Analyze and interpret the data by making an argument for or against increasing the number of volunteer hours required to participate in the annual bird count.\n\n### Analysis: In the graph below, we can see that an increasing number of birds is observed. However, there is a point past which the graph goes downward. This means that more volunteer hours should not be spent doing the bird count.\n\n#### Rationales:\nThe x-axis is the number of volunteer days, so the first thing we notice is that the graphs first starts at 4 days and increases by 1 per x-axis position. Let t represent the number of volunteer day spent on the birding count, n represent the number of birds seen, and y represent the change in number of birds in days. Since the number of volunteer-days x increases by 1, a 1-day increase in volunteer effort causes an increase of n. The change in the slope of the graph represents the effect of volunteer effort on the number of birds. An increase in volunteer-days causes an increase in birds, but the number of birds increases by decreasing the slope in the graph as t increases.\n\n#### 4\nAnswer: 4\n\n### Instance:Write a letter that appropriately describes the situation.

I didn't know how to find help there, so I asked around for advice and people all told me where to look. A professor in math took a liking to me, and started tutoring me. He knew I desperately wanted to make new friends but I didn't know where I could make friends at if I couldn't do my own homework. He made it fun for me to do math. He set puzzles for me to solve, and he even let me come and take tests in his class so I could pass my own, and do everything I needed to in my other classes.

Choice A shows that it is impossible for a tired animal to keep alive (and so it is false). Choice B shows that it is unlikely for a tired animal to need to eat (and so it is true for choice B). Choice C shows that it is highly unlikely for a tired animal go to sleep (and so it is likely that the animal is not tired because it does not go to sleep when tired). Finally, choice E shows that it is likely for an animal to go to sleep when tired (and so it is also likely for this choice).

If x = 40 days, what is the value  of y?\nAnswer A: If x is the number of years the kids studied together, then y is the number of months.\nSince 5 years is not divisible by 12, y does not equal 12 months.\nSince 3 months is not divisible by either 12 or 24, y does not equal to any of these options.\nSince 2 hours is divisible by 2, y = 2.  \nSince 40 days does not represent any of the days in a calendar month, then neither does y.\n#### 2\nAnswer B:\n\n### Democracy:\nA republic is a type of government in which the citizens elect a representative to govern the country.

Your mom offered to drive you. But, her car runs on fossil fuels, so it is harmful to the environment. Instead, your father offers to drive you and drive his hybrid car, a type of car that minimized fossil fuel emissions. A hybrid car is an ordinary car with an extra, secondary source of energy, like a battery, to power it without using as much fossil fuel. How many fewer miles does a hybrid car use than fossil-fuel-powered cars per mile driven?\n\n### Solutions:The average efficiency rating is 45 miles per gallon for a regular car. The batteries of a hybrid car last a maximum of 10 miles before they need to be recharged, using the car\u2019s fuel-powered engine to do so. Once full, the batteries provide electricity until the car needs more power than that engine can give. Using the 90-mpg car\u2019s efficiency at once, we will say that the batteries power the engine 50 times in the 10 miles, while the car uses 45 miles of gas for the 10 times the engine is not in use. To find how many miles a 90 mpg car drives with a tank of gas, we subtract the number of trips the car used its fuel-powered engine from the number of miles of gas available. Since a tank is 12 gal, and there were 45 miles from the gas to use, we find that each tank covers 3 tanks. To find total number of tanks required to travel 45 miles, we multiply 45 by 3, which yields 135. Thus, to travel 10 miles, the gas tank is used in 7 1/2 tanks,", "answer": "C: san francisco"}

{"text": "The correct option is E.  Animal abuse can occur in pet stores, and animal abuse can occur in the woodland.\n\n### Explanation:\n \nWhen given multiple choice situations, you want to look at the entire question to find the possible locations animals could be harmed.  You have to consider the entire question when deciding this because multiple different possible answer choices will probably not occur in the same areas.  You can use strategies like the rule of eight to help guide you.  The rule of eight states that if eight out of every nine items being looked at appear to not belong, you should look for an item that does not match the pattern.  Here, however, we are being presented with a list of possible places where animals can be hurt.  Therefore, the rule of eight does not apply and this is a question where you will need to use multiple strategies.  Look at the possibilities where animal abuse could occur and find out what places are most likely to abuse animals.\n\nFirst, animal abuse could occur at a pet store.  Some pet stores sell animals, and selling an animal involves treating the animal differently.  A pet store that makes an animal appear happy when it is not can hurt that animal.  A pet store can also cause animal abuse by keeping the animals in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions.  Even if an animal does not suffer an injury from a pet store, it would suffer a great deal when sold as a pet.\n\nAnother place where animals can suffer is the woodland.  This can happen when hunters use baiting techniques to attract animals for hunting.  Baiting a bear with a dead animal is extremely cruel.  Hunting, itself, can be harmful to animals because it removes the balance between the species in a woodland.\n\nNow that we have seen two locations where animals may experience harm, you can look for additional places where this can occur.  You will only see harming behavior once.\n\nAnother option is the park.  This is one of the least likely locations where animals can be hurt because it is the least likely location for animal sales.  One exception that would be harmful is a shooting range.  This can cause animal abuse because animals would try to avoid the bullets, and therefore, get hurt.  However, the park is unlikely to abuse animals because of shooting because the environment is too", "answer": "A: pet store"}
{"text": "The correct option is B because bumps can result in injuries. You might not know Ali's strength and that walking faster could injure him.\n\n### Input:(2x^10 + 54)^4\n\n### Response:(2x^16 + 54)^3\n\n### Rationale: First, expand the first term, (2x^10): 2x+2x+2x. Second, (54)^((2x)^2) = (54)^16 = 24. Third, multiply the expression together: 2x+24+24 3x+78. Rounds the answer to 2x^16+ 54, since 16 is the greatest power of x.\n\n### Rational:  Answer is B because the answer of the function in the input is the lowest, and the first number you multiply (54) is the largest of all.\n\n### Solution: Multiply 54 by 3 times, because 3 times the first number is the lowest number it can be.\n\n---\n\n## Task 2\nWrite a response that appropriately answers the question.

When more customers are willing to buy chocolate, demand is higher. When fewer customers buy chocolate, then demand is lower. When more chocolate is available, supply is higher. When fewer chocolate bars are available, then supply is lower. Here are some numbers for both demand and supply. Let x = the quantity of chocolate demanded:\n0 < x < 50\n50 < x < 100\n100 < x < 200\n200 < x < and so on\nx = the quantity of chandolate supplied:\n50 < x\n54 < x < 55\n56 < x < 59\n52 < x < 54\n< 56 < x < and so < on\nWhen all numbers for both demand and supple are known the equations would look like this: S^T = D^I\n\n#### \nInput: Let x represent the demand for the chocolate. Then 50 < x < <<50<=x=<=100>>10 x < <<200<=x=<=200>>2 x < 2 which means that demand for chocolate is between 50 and 200. Let y represent the supply of chocolate.

{"text": "Demostration:\nTo get started, you can say: \"B.\" Let us discuss this option after the other options.\n\n### Option A: damage\n\nRationales\nWhat does the word \"damage\" mean? How about the word \"harm\"? They have a similar meaning, in that you don't want to cause either. If you cause damage, you have caused harm, or at least you have caused something unfavorable.\n\n### Additional information:\n\nInput: To clean her house, Angie took a broom and a bucket to clean up the water Damari spilled when she spilled the water she tried to pour. At first, Angie's house had 7 brooms and 13 buckets. How many more brooms and buckets does Angie need to clean her house?\nRationales\nLet's see what we would want to know to answer this question. The number of brooms and buckets that Angie took to clean would not be enough to clean her house. Let's think about it. Angie needs 13-brooms-and-buckets. This means that she needs atleast 13-broom-and-buckets more. We know that Angie didn't have enough brooms & buckets for 7*13=7\u00d713=91 in total. So Angie needed either 1 or 2 8 buckets and 8 brooms, because 91 \u00f7 13 = 7.\n\n### Response\nRationales\nOne way of seeing how the options will apply is to see how we have interpreted the question in the above scenario. We saw that Angie needed to clean up the water in a bucket. Therefore, \"Damari spilled when she poured the water she tried to pou.\" \nSimilarly, \"Damari caused damage when [She] spilled\" since she tried to pour water but didn't. Damari's attempt to pour water is just an example to find out that she was not able to do it. \n### Demostration:\nWe can see that \"Angie's house had\" means \"After Angie cleaned\" and \"Angie took\" means \"to clean her house.\" We could apply these steps to the other options as well with slight variations for this", "answer": "B: going to jail"}

Once you find what you are looking for, you can put whatever amount of money you want to spend on it. Once you put money on the website, the website gives you a code, which you then take to the store. There are also websites that help you put items on layaway. You put money on the item and then you return and pick it up later.  \n\n**Play an online game**\n\n* You must play the whole game at the same time.\n\n**Communicate with people online**\n\n* There are many websites that help you communicate.

The total number of red hats, yellow hats, green hats and purple hats will be labeled R1, Y1, G1 and P1.\nFor the yellow hats, Y1 + Y2 + Y3 = 12, and Y1 = <<Y1=1>>1.\nTherefore we have Y2 + Y3 -1.\nSubtracting Y2 from both sides, we have Y3 - 2 = 0.\nSince each color has 4 hats, we need to solve the equation for Y3.\nY3 = 2\nTherefore the total number of yellow hats Mary has are <<2=2>>2 yellow hats.\n\nFor the green hats, G1 + G2 + G3 = 12.

{"text": "A\n\n**Input**\n\n\\[\\frac{9}{7}\\times[a+b-c]\\]. Solving for a, we get \\[a=\\frac{9}{7}(b+c) - b \\]. So the expression we are simplifying is $[[9/7][(b+c)-b]]$. Note that \\[9/7 = 1.29 = 0.9291667.\\] This is an enormous number, but if we round it to its third decimal place, we get $1.29$. Then, plugging in the given numbers: \\[b=\\frac{28}{7} = 4\\] and \\[c=\\frac{22}{7} = 3.1428571\\]. Then \\[a=\\frac{29}{7} = 7\\]\n\n**Rationales**\n\nThis is a very typical question where you will get a number followed by a fraction then some numbers written underneath the equation with their values and you must remove the fraction to get the correct answer. In this case, the question goes $[[X+Y-Z]/(9/7)].$\n\nThis particular fraction may be a little different, but the logic between this problem and most others is that the value of the fraction is 9/7 but once you plug in values for a, b, and c and simplify the equation you will get rid of the fractions.\n\nA good strategy is to find values for a and b so that the value for c is equal to zero. You could also try out different values when you know the expression is too complicated to simplify easily.\n\nSince we know the value of the fraction to be 9/7, we add (9/7) times 2 to c, then subtract that value from b and end up getting a value of 7. Then we plug in these values for a and the equation is $7(\\frac{28}{12})-4(\\frac{22}{12})$\n\nRaising (28)/12 to the power of one is just to multiply by 28 and then changing to our common denominator which is 12. Now since we know that (22/7) has a value of 3.14 we plug those numbers in to the equation and get $4 \\cdot 7-3", "answer": "E: breathe deeply"}

For example, the minimum wage is 15 dollars in Arkansas, but it increased from 10 dollars in Michigan, which is the highest minimum wage in the Midwest.\nHow much more, on average, does Michigan's minimum wage reach than the minimum wage in Arkansas?\nRationales\nLet x represent the minimum wage in Michigan.\nLet y represent the minimum wage, in dollars, of the Midwest\u2019s highest state.\nx + y = the minimum wage in states in the Midwest. Let z = that minimum wage.\n\nz = x + y = x + the Midwest\u2019s minimum wage = <<x+z=x+z>>x + z.\nThe average, or mean, of a group is the total sum of that group divided by the number of addends, x+z = (x + z) / (x + z = <<x+z=-/(-/ x-z>>x \u2013 z)\nSubstituting the minimum wage, that is equal to x \u2013 z, and dividing both sides by x - z, x = (1 + z) / (1 \u2013 z) = <<1+z/(1-z)>>1 + z / (1 \u2013 z).\nSimplifying, we get that Michigan's average minimum wage is 26 dollars.\nIn 2019 the average minimum wage in states of the Midwest was <<26/(-/ (1+z)=36>>36 dollars, while the average minimum wage of the other states was <<26/2-z=->>26 / 2 - z.\nThe average minimum wage in 2019 was 26 + 2 * 36 = <<26+48=74>>74 dollars, or 74/2 = <<74/2=37>>37 dollars.\n#### 37\nAnswer: 37\n\n### Instuctions:\nInput:\nRalph and Lisa each earn $1,000 each month.

Many park visitors are annoyed by these out of order toilets. Since the park is heavily populated with children, the smelly, unsanitary toilets are a safety danger for the children. Moreover because visitors now cannot use the park's restroom, they end up going to a nearby shopping center, which is very expensive. In order to fix the bathrooms, I need donations. If you don't want to hear your children complain, and save a lot of money, consider donating to our restroom campaign. As a volunteer, park official, and park visitor, I know that the restrooms are essential for the enjoyment of your visit to the park. If visitors are donating money, why not fix the toilets?\n\nSituation2->\nI am currently volunteering as a coordinator for the park's sanitation facilities. However, I am currently facing a dilemma.

Every dollar you give will be used to fix a malfunctioning toilet in the park. I also have set the dollar value you will spend to fix each type of toilet problem.

If we total together this salary, they will be a total of $$10011$$dollars. Since, the total is 160,000, that means every single worker is supposed to make $10011 dollars in one year. We already know that three worker's make 3* (the amount) which is $36.21 dollars.\n\n2.  Therefore, the amount of money that the third worker makes is $15,964.79. This shows us that the workers made more than the amount that was needed for them to reach, which is their salary for that particular year.\n\n###### (20 points) Answer: This is the problem :\n\n**Instruction** : Input: If 1725 people walked to an amusement park, 88% of the attendants were under the age of 10 and the remainder were over the", "answer": "C: entertain"}

On the first day of December one year, 2/3 of the trees were Christmas trees. What percentage of the trees were not Christmas trees?\nRationales We can solve this by cross multiplying on division 58% * 2/3 = <<2/3*58%=<<48%>>48%. Which tells us that 48% of trees are Christmas trees.\nDividing each side by 48%, the equation becomes 1/48%.\nFactoring 1/4 = 1/2 so the equation becomes 1 divided by 2. \nWe solve for the answer by crossing multiplied by division 2/1 = 2. \nSubstituting the answers, we have 2 = <<2-2=0>>2 = 0\nWe can solve for 100%, the answer is 58% - 48% = <<58%-48%=<<10%>>10%.\nSince 10% is not divisible by 100%, 10% * 100% = <<10%*100%=0>>0\n\n#### 0\nAnswer: 0\n\n### Input :A man drives an hour at the speed of 60 km/h.

She wants to know how many marbles, in a bag, she needs to have 91 marbles.\n\nTapanga decides to try to use a ratio rule to solve her fraction. By multiplying the numerator and denominator of the reciprocal of her question fraction by 9, we can obtain the whole number equivalent of her fraction by finding 9 times 8 of the numerator and 9 times the denominator. Tapanga's ratio is equal to the reciprocal of 9 divided by the reciprocal of the whole number equivalent. Since there are 9 bags of marbles, each bag can multiply 9 times to equal the whole number equivalent to 91. Tapanga has 39 bags of marijuana.\n\n### Tapanga needs to put 15 bags of marijuans into her car. She decides to fill every other bag with marijuana. How much marijuana will be in each bag?\n\nIf Tapanga puts 15 bags into her car, she knows that it will take 9 bags to equal 91 marijuana (9*9=81), but it will take more than 9 bags to get 15 bags (9*5=45). So which marijuana will fit if she spreads it in every other bag?\n\nTapanga has 9 bags, so to make an every other bag system, Tapanga needs to have five whole number numbers (2,4,6,8,12) of marijuana, plus a numerator number 38.

This has been a result of many people moving away from farms to live in cities. It has also happened as a result of a large number of people migrating to countries, especially Europe and North America.  \n\nThe increase in people moving to cities began for many reasons. One main reason for people moving away from farming to cities was that technology made it easier to grow lots of crops on farmland. At the same time as the number of people moved to cities, some people also realized a change in farming. This included how farmers grew crops, and also how they transported crops from the farm to the cities where people bought the food. These changes in growing food made it easier for farmers to grow food, and then they could sell more food. \n\nAnother reason for the increase in the number of cities was that cities, with their different amenities, provided more services.

Note: the last two requirements are in conflict.\n\n### Rationales:\n233 is an even number but 322 isn't.\n25+23= <<25+23>>28 is in between the two numbers.\nWe know that 4 x <<(28-23)>>11 x 4 = <<(28-10)>>18 cannot be a factor of the smaller number x.\nAdding 18 to the smaller number means the answer would either be 2-318 or 2-319.\nFor the smaller number to satisfy one of the requirements, it cannot be a multiple of 18, which means the answer to this two digit addition would be 322.", "answer": "D: old cheese"}

If the temperature at dusk is higher than at dawn, what is the temperature during the day?\nRationals:If the temperature at dawn is d and the temperature at dusk (that's the same as night) is c, then noon (by our definition) is x + (c-d).If noon is x + (c - d) and the temperature at noon is y, so y is equal to x + (c- d), so c + d = x + y, so c = x + y - d.\n\nc = *(y - d)*\n\nThis means our answer to the question is *((y - d) - d) = y*.\n\nRationales:The temperature at day is equal to y - d, so d < y. (Note that the temperature at day is a little too large than dusk temperature, so the temperature at night is still less than day temperature by this equation.)\nSince x + y < 20, (20 - x) + x = (x + y) - (x + x) = y - x.\nThis is what d is equal to.\nd = y - x\n\nSubstituting that value for d ------------\n\nd = *(y - (y-x)) = *(y-y) = 0 <=> y = d + x\n\nD = *(d-d) = *(0-(0)] = *(0*0)\n\nAnswer: *(d - y)\n\n### Instructiom:Answer the next question\n### Demonstation:", "answer": "D: engine"}

The ticket prices were $65, $30, and $12. They had a total of $47. They had $23 left for snacks after purchasing concert tickets. How much did each person spend?\n\nRationales: $47 + $23 = <<47+23=65>>65 (Together $65 + $30 and $12, for a total 107)\n\n$107 + 23 = <<107+23=126>>126\n\n$66 + 11 = 55\n\nSo $$47$$ dollars spent for each person to go to the concert and then they shared $66 and they spent $23 for snacks.\n\n#### 55\nAnswer: 16\n\n### Explanation:\nI thought about whether it was Corey or James because if it was Corey then we would have to go backwards and see how we would divide the total remaining money. For James we knew 1 dollar for each person so we started with that and saw if we could add it to the $66. Then, if it was Corey I had to start at 77 because $66 (1dollar per person) + 23 $ (spent by each person on snacks) = 77.\n\nI thought it was Corey first but then saw how it was James.\n\n### Task:\n\nFor practice, write a response to the following task: \nGina went camping for five nights and five days.

The fencing team did not spend more than 75% of its budget.\n2. The fencing team could have spent less than 50% of the budget on equipment.\n3. The fencing team spent less than 5% of the budget on uniforms.\n4. It is impossible for the fencing team to have spent 50% of their budget on uniforms and the other percentage on equipment since their budget consists of more than 50% spent on uniforms and less than 25% spent on equipment.\n\n5. The fencing team's budget could have been spent 100% on equipment and 0% on uniforms since the budget does not have to be less than 50%.\n6. The fencing team only spent 25% off their budget on uniforms. This is because the fencing team spent 50% or more of its budget on equipment and the fencing team spent some amount off their budget on uniform, not more than 25% and not less than 0.\n\n7. The fencing team didn't spend 50% off their budget on equipment. this is because they didn't spent any amount less than 25%, but more than 50%.

If order indicates the specific place in line. But order and order line are not equivalent.\n\nQueueing up is a combination of wait turn and queue. We need to wait for our turn to be able to queue. Wait turn is actually a verb. It shows up first in the sentence. We should pick wait turn to complete the sentence.\n\n### Input:(I want to order a small coffee.)

How long does it take to complete the entire poster?\nSince there are 80 different pieces, there are 80 ways we can place the pieces on the poster.\n\n#### Since the poster is bigger than the monitors of the computers, how many ways can the pieces be displayed on the monitors?\nThe monitors are fixed to the computer, so we cannot move or resize the monitors.\nTherefore, we only need consider the cases of 80 pieces.\nWe must also make sure all the pieces are included in the answer, so there are 80-1=79 ways to place the pieces in the space available on the computers' monitors.\n\n#### Since we have no limits on space or quantity, how many ways can a total of 420 pieces (500 computers + 80-1 = 79-1= 78 total pieces) be placed if it can contain any 80 (500 computers)+ 80 (79 total pieces) types of items?\nWe can place them in any combination, so there are 2**80 ways to fit the pieces at the monitor.\n\n#### Does 2**80 include the 79 types of pieces placed in the 79 monitors?\nWhen working with combinations, we must consider that the total parts in the combination are the same as the combinations.\n\n#### The poster has a fixed size, and the monitor has a fixed size.

But she was was not.\nE: she felt love because she was working hard in the search for job, but that was not the situation.\n\n#### E\nAnswer: E\n\n### Solution\n\n### 5.\nWe are given a number and asked to find a fraction or mixed number equivalent to the given number. We should convert the number into a whole number, multiply that number with a denominator, and keep repeating the process until the number is in the form of a fraction or mixed number.\nFor Example: If we have a number 10, then we split it into 10 and 0. We must multiply it by any denominator but the denominator must be greater than 1. Since 10/2 = 5 is less than 1, we cannot use that divisor and we multiply it by 10/5 = 2 and do the process again. Now it is 10/(10*2). We divide that number by 1 to get (10*2)/2 which is 5 so we need to divide it by 5/2 and get 10/5(10/5) which is 3.\n\n### **\n### 2.**\n\n\n### Input\n\n### Explanation\nWe are given a two digit number and we divided the smaller number from the larger number. For Example: if we had 54, then we subtract the right one from the left one, and we will get 4. If we had the same number, but were given 67 for the right number then we divided by 6, and we got the final answer because 4 isn't divisible by 6.\nIf we gave 97 for the right number, then we divided 9 by 7 and we will get 1.\n\n### Output\n\n### Expected Output:\n#### 1\n\n### Answer:\n\n\n### 20.\n\n### Expectation\n\n### Explination\n\n### Answer", "answer": "B: frustration"}

{"text": "Write either A or a. \n \n### Explanation:\nThe reception question refers to a party. Grand Casinos are for very important events and are very expensive. Large rommns are the rooms for banquets and large gatherings. Country clubs are for golf in a nice community, and lobby are for very important people. Restaurants have dinner rooms for large meals, and large meals for a restaurant are more expensive.", "answer": "B: large room"}
{"text": "The question is a bit tricky, because it asks the past time that people engage in when they are travel on a liquid and it does not define the type of liquid, what it looks like, or any other descriptors. It also does not provide us with the type of liquid, only the fact that the liquid is not dry. The choices available to us in the question are only one type of pastime.\n\n### Response2:The question has a single variable and a single choice. We can represent this using the following variables:\n$sailB$ for sail B\n$high_fives$ for high fives\n$question$ for question authority\n$shareThings$ for share things\n$learnFrom$ for learn from each other\n(Since $learFrom$ was a choice, it is not part of the choice set and is actually represented as \"not in the choice set\", which can be shown as a $not$.\n\nOur decision is determined by whether or not the liquid is dry or not, which we can write as $dry$ vs $not dry$.\n(not in the choice set)\nTo translate the question, we find that sail B does not travel on water which implies that sail B's \"pastime\" is $not sail B$. There is no \"not in the choice\" for \"question authority\", but since the past time is \"question\", the statement can be simplified to $authority$ vs question and the options for that are $question$ vs $authority$.\n$high_fves$ travels on water, so $high_fifves$ is the pastime here.  Share things never travels on water so the choice is $not shareThings$. Finally, learn from each other travels on both water and non-water in that it includes sailing and land and we do not know which it refers to. Since the past time is \"travel\", the options for that are either $not in water$ or $in water$. The final choice is now $inWater$.\n\nThe final choices are as follows.\n$not sailB$ vs $authority$\n$high_fivrs$ vs $question$\n$not shareThings$ vs $in water$\n\n#### Answer:Incorrect\n\nAn alternative approach is to use the method of [substituting values](https://blog.prepscholar.com/use-", "answer": "A: sail boats"}

Choices:  A: stress B: debate C: argument D: winning or losing E: tension<n><n>### Response:		C<n>Rationales: A: You might think that stress and debates are competitive things. However, these are the things you tend to have before and during a competition. Competitions don't typically cause stress or debates.<n>B: These things have nothing to do with competitions. Debates don't often result in a "win or lose" and tension doesn't typically increase during a competition. Stress, arguments, and debates are typically caused by people who aren't competing. You wouldn't have an argument between two football players, or while both of them are running in sync. Stress, fights, and debates are arguments between two people.<n>C: You are correct that competition causes arguments, fights, and tension<n>D: This isn't a competition thing that happens. You may argue and/or fight with someone before you find out you're competing against them. You could become upset about having to compete against someone. However, in the actual competition, you won't be concerned with winning or losing, but rather winning. A competitor typically cares more about winning than they care about losing.<n>E: Competitions aren't tense by themselves. You would be more tense if you were upset about competing, or if you were concerned with how you're performing. Competitions don' want create any tension. They will give you energy instead.<n>#### C<n>Answer:C<n><n>### Input : Choose the best sentence.<n>A:  There is a 1:1 ratio between the boys and girls.<n>B:  There is not a 1:1 proportion between the boys and girls<n><n>### Response :Answer A<n><n>### Dem:<n>A: There is a 1 to 1 ratio between the size proportion of boys to girls. Choosing A makes logical sense.<n>B: This does not make sense. The ratio is equal but the boys have a smaller value. If the values are equal, there can't be a greater value than the others. You would always compare with the highest value not the least.<n>B : Both are incorrect. B says it's not a 1: 1 ratio. However, the numerator is equal to the numerator and the denominator is equal to the denominator, so there is a 1 to1 ratio. Thus, saying B is incorrect.<n>

Also, there is also a word has, so something must have been given to the snake. If there is anything that the snake had for breakfast then there is the definite article “the”. So the snake had something that is not specified, most likely the snake was given an apple as it is different from the common breakfast for pythons.<n><n>### Eviation:If the snake does not have a different breakfast, it will not have a different lunch as there is no definite article with the words breakfast and lunch. Without a definite article, we can assume that there is nothing special in its diet.<n><n>### Answer:Yes. There are only two types of articles in the English Language: the and a. The sentence in the question starts with “What did”, which means the subject pronoun is a non-informant person, therefore the definite articles should be used, not the indefinite articles.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>### Instuction:Write the answer with the least amount of characters.<n><n>### Question:If the snake had something different for lunch, then it also would have had something different for breakfast.<n><n>###

Choices:  A: sitting down B: excitement C: tiredness D: progress E: procrastination<n><n>### Response:		You are correct.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Let us use the formula V = (10 ÷ k)(k × k), that is volume (V) = k (x × x), where k and x are natural numbers. The input asks us to find the smallest k, not V, for the given numbers. To do so, we want to find the smallest x of this set.<n><n>```<n><n>```<n><n>### We can start by noting that 10 is the least natural number 10 that will form a valid volume - that is, it is the least natural number in this set. 10 = 102. And so k = 10.<n><n>- Since volume is a product, the x = x2 is the key to our equation. Thus the smallest x in this set is less than 16.<n><n>- We want to use as many k’s and x’s as we can. We can take any number for x < 16 and have a valid product. This is because if you multiply by a small x, such as 2, the volume is still 10. Therefore, even though the product will be less, it will still be a valid volume (assuming k remains stable). However, once x is 16 and the product changes to something larger, the product does no longer remain a valid volume. Thus k must 10 or less.<n><n>- When x begins to approach 16, the product will get closer and closer to being 10 cubed. As soon as this happens, volume will no longer be 10 x cubed. If x is 16, then a=4.91563; if x is 17, a=5.09520; etc. Therefore, volume will no longer equal 10 (a=5.20031 for x = 28 and greater).<n><n>- Therefore, the maximum x is 16.<n>``` <n><n>### 16, and 10 = 210, which is a valid volume.<n><n><n>- The question, though, is about a minimum product, not a maximum, so the answer is “D”.

Instead, I thought of the police, so I made the assumption that policemen were in the scene to protect people from accidents. Therefore, I analyzed the word policemen, which could be a noun or a verb. A policemen could either be one person or many, so I thought that the policemen was a group.

Choices:  A: driving B: road C: getting tired D: accidents E: ticket<n><n>### Response:		The correct response should be <n><n>- "A: driving"<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Input contains the phrase "moving cars" as an entire sentence. Therefore, you need to figure out what the phrase entails in order to select the correct answer. (A) A: driving shows that when you move a car, you either are in the car or drive it. You can then cross out B and D, because you cannot be in the car or drive the car by yourself without someone else. The answer also implies that you are tired from driving the car if you are driving for long periods of time. You can then cross off the last choice E because this reason does not make sense. This leaves you with A and C. In the sentence, it does not say anything about getting a ticket, only driving, not being tired and getting into a car, which you would be when you are driving. Your driving a car is the answer since you can be both tired and in the car.<n><n>### Response 2<n><n>- "A, getting tired"<n><n>### Demo input:<n><n>- "What does moving cars entails?

Choices:  A: tiredness B: living longer C: stomach ache D: illness E: acid reflux<n><n>### Response:		B<n>#### Response<n>Your answer is correct.<n>#### Rationales:<n>In order to explain your thinking, you should write a paragraph that does the following:<n>First, provide at least three reasons why you feel the answer is correct. It must be detailed with specifics from the text to support your claim.<n>Next, explain the evidence from the text that you found to support your answer.<n>#### Paragraph<n>Dinner is the main meal of the day. It is meant to provide ample nutrition in a single meal. However, eating too much dinner is likely to result in stomach ache or illness. The evidence from the text that supports this answer is from my parents. They always eat dinner at approximately the same time and usually in large portions. So, they eat a very large portion of the food at once. This results in stomach aches at the end of the evening. This is the probable cause for their stomach aches. There are several other reasons why eating too much results in a stomach ache. <n>In my personal experience, I have eaten too much before and gotten severe stomach aches that last several hours. My symptoms from eating too much were a pain in my abdomen, loss of appetite, feeling lethargic, and sleeping to help me not feel the pain anymore. I also felt bloating in my stomach. Eating too much or eating at the wrong time has been known to cause acid reflux. Acid reflux is caused by the stomach acid flowing backwards and burning the esophagus. Eating too much will cause your stomach to expand and can cause the burning sensation of acid reflux. <n>Eating too much can also cause you to burn more calories digesting the food over the next day or so. For example, after an excessively large Thanksgiving dinner, you can expect to sleep for almost 12 hours. This is because you body will be consuming too much food. Ingesting too much food and not allowing enough rest will result in illness. The other body parts will become overloaded and will eventually get sick.<n>Honestly, I would not eat too much. It is not pleasant to begin eating the food but when you see how delicious it is and how hungry you feel, the

However I will answer the second statement with no, that does not sound plausible.<n><n>#### 3.<n><n>###Rationales:I will write the steps first then rational and then the rational.<n><n>Step 1: Write it out, I like to write everything out first then add explanation after. So write out "I am a dog and I have a bone."<n><n>Step 2: Now rewrite "I am a dog", "I am a dog" is I am. Then rewrite "and I have a bone", and I have a bones would sound right. Then rewrite "I am a I have a dog", I am I a dog would sound weird but I am I have a bone sounds weird. It would sound like I am a I am I have a dog. Rewriting "I like to write", "I like to write it out" would sound right so rewrite that too I write it out.<n><n>Step 3: Now that you rewrote everything then write and explain it all. So if I write "I am a dog, and I have a bong." is what I write out. So writing and then explaining is, "I am a dog. And I have a bone. I like to write out everything. I like not to have a bone and then explain it."<n><n>So, rational is we rewrote "I am a dog I have a bone I like to write," which means when you read it, it is "I am a dog a bone like to write." You do not want to say "I am a dog the bone I like to" because it doesn't sound right. Like "I am that I am a bone I like I like to write."<n>So rational is don't say "I am a bone I" because it sounds weird. So my rational is, "I am writing out what I said in the beginning is rational. So rational is, "I was writing out what I am writing out now."<n><n>So what I mean to my what I

We can see this by looking in English and Japanese. 3€ per kilometer sounds very similar between the two, and if we translate "kilometer" to ㎞, then the relationship can be found.

My favorite activities are rollercoaster type attractions, like Cryptosweeper. We can get a group to go on the ride and it will reduce the price of the ride for each of us. I also enjoy Ferris Wheels. We can get a bunch of my friends or family and have each of them pay to get on individually, so we can go on several times throughout the day. Another good option is going to the casino. At one point in time, I spent all day there and got bored only once as there was so much to do and do all day to maximize our time.<n><n>### Inputs: What do you think of the film The Matrix?<n><n>**Response:**<n>After seeing this film, I believe the world has been living in a virtual world for millennia. My evidence is that this world is just a copy of the real world. For instance, at the start of The Matrix the character Neo appears to live in a world only with the people that he is friends with. This is because they must have been virtual copies in the same place as him. But, then if my theory was true, he should not have a dog. His only dog would be a computer program that simulates one. The simulation argument is when a virtual reality simulation would be indistinguishable from reality. And, this film did not pass this test.<n><n>### Comments:Comment on the answer provided by Toby from Monday 9:45 class.<n>

Choices:  A: church B: theatre C: large city D: water fountain E: central park<n><n>### Response:		<n>```<n>E<n>```<n><n>### Rationales:<n>The correct answer is E because it matches the context of the question. A, B, and C can't refer to thousands of statues. The choices of E and C makes the least sense. We know that the question asks about thousands but the context is to ask about a statue. The statues aren't in those choices, so they can't be correct. The choices of A and B makes the most sense because those choices refer to churches (a place of thousands) however they don't use thousands but the question does mention thousands so A and B can't be the answer.<n><br>I came up with these answers by going through each choice one by one and thinking about what could refer to thousands.<n>[link to my reasoning:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/185W4z2R9y2zIiVR_vg_C0vxVaLlD4JnW/view?usp=sharing)<n>#### 27<n>Answer: E<n><n>### Input<n>Flor had two marbles left.

Choices:  A: persia B: table C: living room D: house E: desk<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Let us first start off with the first part because that's the hardest part to solve for.<n><n>The first part is that: We can't say that it is a rug of Persia since the subject is the mother and we do not know if she is from Persia. Therefore, we rule that out.<n><n>We can't say it is a living room rug because, as I said, we don't know if the mother is Persian.<n><n>Despite this, we have to eliminate the other options.<n><n>For example, the table cannot be a rug for the living room because we said that the mother was worried about the spill. Also, a Persian rug and a living room rug look nothing alike and would be very hard to tell apart,<n><n>Therefore, we are left with the other two options: a rug under the desk and a rug under the house. I know you might think that I am lying about under the house, but I am not. I am not just saying it under the house and here's why.<n><n>When someone is walking in their house, they don't step on the rug that is underneath the house. They step on the rug in the living room.<n><n>And also, if someone is walking on a rug under the house, they are going to clean that very quickly. When someone is walking on a living room rug, or a table rug, then they may decide not to clean it for a while because they are going to walk on that rug a lot.<n><n>Therefore the answer is under the house.<n><n><n>

However, to say that he “could” move something is to say he has the ability to do so.<n>C: To move, the man would have needed to have been walking to have been moving by doing so. The text states that he "could,” which is future action. If he was walking in the past, he must have stopped to allow the question to be asked.<n>D: Stand still is a verb that does not imply movement, which is an essential component of the question.<n>E: Walking, or walking slowly is an action that indicates movement. To answer question, we need to know the condition at the moment of the question.

They performed at all of their school functions, had a large audience at each performance, and won awards for their choral works. After John graduated, he joined his mother in a rock band. He began making more money with the band than at his former job. However, John felt a need to help other upcoming choir members, and he decided to form a choir for young children. He wanted to help the young children learn to love singing as much as he did. He felt a need to share the choral experience with these children. Which of the following statements about John would you expect to be most true?"<n>A: John values money more than he valued helping others.<n>B: John likes rock music more than he likes jazz music.<n>C: John is more talented in music than he is in business. <n><n><n>### Rationale:John was a member of all of the school’s choirs. This means he enjoyed singing and was good at it. A: John valued money more than other things. A child enjoys singing for free, but John had to pay people to go to all of these functions, so he must have valued money more than singing.<n>B: John liked rock music better than he liked jazz music. John was a member of the choral club, which means he liked jazz music. There were other chord players on his team, so John likes at least one other type of music besides rock.<n>C: John was more talented in music instead of business. In order to have the choir, John had to sing with the children. He is good at singing, so we know he has talent in music. <n><n><n>#### 65<n>Answer: C<n><n>### Input Situation:<n><n>### Answer:<n>#### 60<n>Answer: C<n>

Choices:  A: trash can B: honey C: bouquet of flowers D: rose garden E: field of flowers<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### D<n><n>#### Explanation: The wording of this question is somewhat confusing. Bees are attracted to red flowers so they likely get their honey from the rose garden rather than the beehive. Since red flowers and roses are synonyms, red flowerS is more accurate here rather than flowers with red on them. This is why option A is incorrect because flowers in the trash can aren't red.<n><n>Option D is the correct answer because the hives are located in gardens and not around trash cans.

He was a bit upset that he had to do it, but he needed the job.  Still, he would have preferred it if the job were what? Choices:  A: present B: stay here C: closer D: available E: come here<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Rationales:Lets see  if A, B, C, or D is present in the question.<n>If 'The job beats family' is true, then A cannot be correct (because family is chosen over job, not the other way around).<n>If 'He was a bit upset' is true, then B cannot be correct (because we only care about the upset and not what it was about).<n>If 'he needed the job' is true, then C cannot be correct (because if there were multiple jobs to choose from, choosing one over the other because it was better in some way would not work as a 'preferred job' because the original job is always better than all the alternatives for the reasons we already gave in A, B, and C).<n>If 'John' is present in the question, then that makes it obvious that 'job' and 'family' are referring to different entities (such as a job and a family member of a specific person).  There's no reason to assume that 'the job' refers to John's job rather than Job B's job or Job C's job, etc.  There's no indication that he is not a family heir so why should he have a preference for the family job?<n>If 'come here' is present in the sentence, then E cannot be correct.  There is no reason to assume that he has family and job in the same place.  As a result of the previous assumption, if the job was available in the same place as the family, that possibility doesn't exist and E couldn't be chosen as it is available in the area he lived in anyways.<n><n>### Thus, C is correct.<n><n>### Input:'She saw him kiss Mary and then she began to tear up.' Choices: A: It made her sadder B: She was happy C: It hurt her D: She became angrier<n><n>### Rationale:Lets see if a, b, or d are present in the sentence.<n>If 'She was happy' it would be opposite than to 'become angrier' so A would not be correct.<n>If 'She began to tear up' is present in the 'become" sentence then it wouldn't be 'it' so E could not be correct.<n><n>##If a is not true, b can't hold true and

A football team is not an entity that could technically go on the football field, even though they are the only entities that interact with it. A school may go on a "campus", though if you saw them driving down the streets, there would be no way to differentiate them from the players. A university campus is where all of the people who are playing football go to work and socialize. A university campus is just the area around the football stadium, but a football stadium is just one place where a team can play on a "football field".<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>```<n>Input:	Sandwich and Tuna fish are both _____ fish.

Choices:  A: interesting B: fun C: joyful or painful D: very important E: free<n><n>### Response:		Detailed Rationales:<n>The answer is D, because someone has to like learning to go through the process of education.<n>Someone who does not like to learn will not care about what they learn. They will also likely not even pay attention in the classes.<n>When a teacher tries to make their class interesting, a student who does not like learning will become bored and their learning will go downhill.<n>It would also not be painful or joyful for someone to not like to learn. If you do not like learning, then you would probably not care about if you get a grade on an assignment.<n>Someone who is learning is learning something new. They will care about what they are learning.<n><n>### Input 2: What is the answer, and why?<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>This answer is B, because it is fun instead of enjoyable. Enjoyable is something that means that someone will like to do it. Fun is the same as enjoyable, but also includes doing fun things that one does for joy.<n><n>### Detailed Rationale:<n><n>#### If you do something for joy, then you will like to do it, so joy means the same thing as fun.<n>#### Someone does things for fun, so enjoyable means they do things for joy.<n>#### Joyful is different because it means happiness while you do something. It means enjoying the same thing that enjoyable and fun do, but it is different because one is having fun while they are doing it, and the other one is having fun and enjoying it.<n><n>### What would you change the learning to be if someone does like learning?<n><n>#### 0<n>Answer: 0<n><n>### Instructions <n><n>Write the numbers that are in parentheses without writing anything else.<n><n>#### 9 (3 x 3 = 9 )<n>Answer: 3<n><n>#### 2 (3 ÷2 = 2)<n>Answer: 3 ÷2 = (1.5)<n><n>#### -32 (9 x (8-9) = -32 )<n>Answer: (9 x (-1)) = -9<n><n>#### 11 (5 x 2 <n><n>### I'm Done<n><n>- [x] Write the numbers that are in the parenthesis.

Choices:  A: living B: feeling good C: hyperventilate D: look around E: breathe deeply<n><n>### Response:		Breathing helps the blood become oxygenated. When it is, it makes you feel great.<n><n>### Rational:Hyperventilation is what you feel when breathing in faster than normal and faster than what is required to function. It is sometimes called panic breathing and it can also make you feel dizzy or faint.<n><n>#### Rationale:A, B, and E are all inaccurate. A is a verb-form of the word living instead of the adjective. B is an inaccurate adjective because what is being done is not an action, but rather a state of being. C does not accurately describe the situation. There is no need for the person to hyperventilate because it is not needed. D is also not an accurate answer. The phrase "look around" does not describe "breathing deeply," and the word deeply cannot be used to replace "deeper." Furthermore, the phrase "in the mountains" limits the possibility to "in the city" or "in the ocean," so it cannot be used to replace deeper.<n><n>\### Rationale Two:<n><n>### Input A: What is the main purpose of ads?<n><n>### Rationale A:<n><n>### Reliability of ads:<n><n>### D: 1/4<n><n>### E: 1/4 (somewhat reputable)<n><n>### F: 1/4  (partially trustworthy)<n><n>### G: 1/4 unreliable<n><n>* Rationale A:Ads, whether through a social setting (for example, walking past a display in the mall) or via the internet (such as a website or social media platform), will persuade you to buy a product.<n><n>* *Rationale 2:*Advertisements are only accurate if you are willing to consider what they are saying.

Choices:  A: gy mnasiu m B: motel room C: seashore D: bath room E: locker room<n><n>### Response:		Motel room<n><n>Rationales: Corey is a person who is on a getaway. It is not possible to determine Corey's nationality. It is not possible, however, to say that the event Corey is attending is not expected. It is also not possible to say that any of these events is not planned by Corey. Corey is staying at a motel.<n><n>### Input 2: A: The president is the head of the United States government which is comprised of many different agencies. B: The executive branch can do anything it wants. C: A bill can do anything it wants with the law. D is a bill passed by the United States Congress. E is a Presidential executive order.<n><n>#### A<n><n>### Response B<n><n>### Rationales<n>A: The people of the United States elect the president. The President of the United States is the head of the government. He manages and coordinates the activities of the agency of the government, which is the executive branch. The President is also responsible for the other branches of government. The President cannot, however, do anything he wants, or he would be in control of the Congress. Congress only gives the President the power to change the law, as Congress decides what the bill of the president is going to be.<n><n>### Answer: A<n><n>#### A<n>#### B<n>#### C<n>#### D<n>#### E<n>#### D<n>#### Response E<n><n>#### Rationales<n><n>E: The Executive Order is a Presidential order. The President does not control Congress. Congress controls Congress. Congress chooses what the order will be. Congress chooses what law it wants. Therefore, the bill has no control over the way the president controls the branch of government, which, of course, has no control at all over what order the president makes. A bill passed by Congress has no control over who is responsible for carrying out the presidential order.<n><n>### B<n>#### Rationales:<n><n>The executive branch is one of the branches of government. It has the power to enforce the law. The Executive Branch is the head of the executive branch, so the executive presidential authority to enforce laws.<n><n>#### C<n><n>Answer 2: E<n><n>### Answer D<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n><n>A, B, and C are all branches of government.

Let the variable x = the number of headaches. Since John is getting something important, the number of headaches is equal to <<head = 27=27>>27.<n>x = 1 is not the answer because John did not get something important. John does not have headaches in the case where x = 0, because people do not become headaches.<n>```<n>Even though John is feeling the headache, it is not what he wants, which makes him feel headaches but not happy.<n>```<n><n>### References<n><n>- https://kami.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009368653-Using-the-fill-in-the-blank-tool<n><n>### Instructions:<n>- A: Add 1 and then multiply by 2.

In the Tokyo Stadium I will be able to watch some of the world's all time rugby power houses such as New Zealand and Argentina and many more. With that, I am sure I can get an opportunity to also watch an exciting game from the famous "All Blacks" (New Zealand Team). Japan is now one of the countries I really want to visit and explore.

Socks are a commodity, which means their value does not go down over time. Socks aren't a good choice for being bought at the laundroma, unless you only get about six pairs and your socks only get about six wears before going into the wash. And jeans, of course, are only meant to be washed periodically or have the holes in them widened. Of course, you still need to buy _some_ socks and so _some_ kind of jeans if you have to wear clothes of either or both types.<n><n>So the only good choices are A and E. If you want to save some money, I suppose D is an option.

The difference between the first number and the missing number will always be the same: three. Since the first number is seven, the missing number is always 12, 13, and so on.<n><n>### Reasoning Strategy: Look for a pattern that will help you find the missing number.<n>

I would not go to a conference to watch a TV show. Choice D has a little bit more sense about going to a church, because you would have to sit facing everyone else at chairs facing the front. I can connect myself to church, however I would have to go to a church that is not a Catholic church where they are sitting down facing the front of everyone at all times during the church. If it was a Catholic Church I could go to then I would have to go sit facing everyone else as well. In choice C a theater is a room with a lot people sitting there. However there would not be any chairs facing a different direction because most theaters are a little different from a building or a floor because the seats are so far away from each other it is like sitting next to someone.<n><n>### Input You may want to go to a church because you can enjoy God’s creation.<n><n>### Output Answer: Choice D<n><n>Blessings,<n><n><n><n>

The diameter of the 38 mm screwwas 63.8 mm and the wrench had the same diameter. How many mm did the nut unscrew the screw head?<n><n>Rationales:<n>If the head is 38 mm, the nut only needs to be 32 mm or less to fit onto the head<n>The wrench needs to have the same diameter as the nut.<n>The 6mm wrench must fit onto the nut<n>Additional information:  (I) = (Screw Head Diameter) + (Nut Diameter)  = (38) + (6) = 44<n>(II) = (Screwed Diameter of 38MM)-(Numer of screw diameter in the nut))  = (63.8-6) = 57.8.<n>The distance of (1) mm is the distance of the nut to remove the screw head. If the nut is 32 mm, the width of 32 is removed from 63.8 to create 57.8, which proves that the nut is 38 + (32-63.8) = 38 + (0.0455) = 38.0455 mm (3 mm). The size of the nut is equal to the width of the wrench of 6mm.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>### Input:Where is a bald eagle safe? Choices:  A: pine tree B: open country C: in washington D: wildlife refuge E: sky<n><n>### Response:		Bald eagles live in open country and open skies. Their feathers are not designed for warmth, and are instead designed for aerodynamic efficiency. The bald eagle’s prey is located by watching for its movements, or in other words, by sight.<n>Given the bald eagles primary food source is fish, its not surprising it prefers to live and hunt in the open country and open skys. One of their most common prey items is the common murre, which travels in flocks that frequent open skys.<n><n>### Rationales<n><n><n><n>The correct answer is Bald. It is safe for bald eagles to nest at a higher altitude than most birds since they are adapted to hunt for their meals by sight. Additionally, the bald eagle prefers to live and nest in open country, as they are prey animals and rely on sight to stalk their prey of fish and other small birds. Additionally, bald eagles are found mostly in North America and are endangered in the lower 48 of the United States, meaning that they are rare.<n><n>### Input<n>> Question: How does the population of a species change over time?<n><n><n>### Response<n>The population of a species grows or shrinks over time. A growing population means the species’ population is increasing. It may die due to various factors including famine, disease, migration/relocation, or other changes in the surrounding environment. This change may be sudden or slow, depending on the situation. When the population shrinks in size, the species' population is depleting. This may also happen as the population grows beyond its carrying capacity. When a population grows, it is said to be in positive population growth. As for when the population shrinks, it is referred to as negative population growth. <n><n>### Rationale<n>The population of a living organism can change either in growing or shrinking and this phenomenon is caused by multiple factors ranging from a change in the availability of food, migration/relocation and death. An organism’s population can fluctuate or even become extinct due to these changes in environment.<n><n>### References<n>[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032078X13005295?via%

The total volume of s units played in a 1-minute period is s²/1000. Let the total volume of music played in an hour be s; then the probability of not listening to music is 50 - s. When s = 0, the probability becomes 50. At that value we have a 50 - 50 = 0 % probability that the person will listen to music. For s ≠ 0, we have a 5s/20% probability that she will listen to music.

The bail will be paid after the person comes to the court a few times and it is decided if they will go to court. They will need someone to pay their bail since this is what the court requires to get the person out of the jail. After they are out of jail, the person might not like to go to court that much.

Rain forest.<n><n>**Let me explain why "A. Rain forest" is the best option:**<n>The word "captive" is defined as "confined to a particular place or environment or way of life; unable to leave". The word "captivating" means "to attract your interest and attention".<n><n>Because the word "captive" indicates the monkey is confined, the correct option is to look for it _in a specific _environment_: rain forest, not _the entire world_: great outdoors.<n><n>The first half of the question is, "Where would _one_ _find_ a _monkey_?" The correct answer is the place to look for a monkey, which is rain forest.<n><n>The third half of the question is "Captivating monkey".

This is why an airport would use a bag like this, because people who take big trips have a lot of clothes and accessories.<n><n>#### C<n>This is a good explanation; you’re on the right track with the nets catching items as they come out, but there are two problems with your thinking. You state that the items are coming out, when the drawstring bag is actually used to collect items in. Additionally, your explanation didn’t include why the airport would use a drawstring type of bag. Try again!<n><n>### Rationales: Drawstring bags have nets in them which catch things as they come out.

We may have to turn to fish farming or to eating insects.<n>Which one of the following options will feed more people?<n><n>A) Farming more fish B) Eating farmed insects C) Both are equal D) Eating fish<n><n>### Respond<n>Since farmed fish are raised in artificial conditions, such as a saltwater pond or fish tank, it is more expensive than free ranging fish. Farmers who raise fish have to make use of the same amount of resources, but must raise more fish to make the same amount of profit. When it comes to eating insects, such as cicadas or crickets, it is unclear if enough protein can be provided if people consumed a sufficient amount. Furthermore, insects are not an option in most parts of the world, either because they are not a staple food or because they do not exist at all. This leaves farming fish, due to the ease and large potential amount of fish the farmer can raise, as the best option to feed more people.<n><n>### Input:"We'd like to go back and buy that shirt.

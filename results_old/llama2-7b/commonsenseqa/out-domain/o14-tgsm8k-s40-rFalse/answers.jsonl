Answer the question using this formatting style, except as explained in the paragraph with the prompt.\n\n### Counterpoint:Science research is often funded by universities. This is not true for all universities,  however. At the University of Missouri,  university research grants cover the cost of research from students, but do not cover the cost of graduate student stipends. The university receives money for all research and uses that money to support student stipends, which allows students to focus on research. The students also do this research to develop their graduate school applications. The University of Missouri has an agreement with all students who take stipend money that they will provide information about their research so that they will graduate on time. This agreement, however, requires that the students meet with a researcher each month to show their progress on their research project. This meeting is mandatory for anyone who wants to receive a stipend.\n\n### Paragraph:What are the benefits to the student and the university that come from a student research project? Provide at least one example for each benefit.\n\nOutput: The benefits to the student are:\n\nA. The student has the opportunity to conduct primary research, rather than simply reading about their subject.\n\nB.The student can apply the research they are doing for their thesis to their graduate school application and can help shape their future research in graduate school.\n\nC.They can work closely with an experienced researcher, and they can learn the process required to work with graduate students, faculty, and staff to conduct research.\n\nD.The student can meet other students in their field and learn about research projects being done at the university around them.\n\nOutput:The benefits to the university come from a student research:\n\nA.The university can see what type of research is ongoing at their university.\n\nB.

First of all because there is atmospheric temperature inversion, the temperature of the atmosphere from high to low increases, the air in the shallow atmospheric layer is in the state of water vapor, and the water vapor in the high temperature will condense to form the water cloud. So when there is a temperature inversion, clouds appear. \n\n> 2.  Why when there is a strong temperature inversion, there is a big rain? \n\n>   - The cause of strong temperature inversion is that there are large differences in temperature in the atmosphere near the surface and at high altitudes.

In my opinion, this is an art; it is a way to communicate to each other. This can be used in math, programming, and all other creative forms.\n\n### **Solve 11x + 9 = 9**\nSolving this equation is easy: I factor 11, which will give me (11 x 8) (or 9x9). When we multiply 9x9 we will get a 81, which is the same number that is in the left side. That means 81x8 = 81x1 = 81, so if (11 x 9) = 81 and that means 81 x 8 = 652. The solution is 9 and 652.\n\n### I have solved lots of Factoring problems, here are some examples.

This is an example based on a math question.\n\n## What is the question that would be of most interest to a reader?\n\nI would find it most interesting to know the answer to this question as it relates to how much one would earn from being a freelance writer.\n\n## How would you answer the question?\n\nThe question refers to the $2000 in the example. If the $200 for \"the first 2 times\" is added to the $20 for \"the last six times\" the answer is 2200 = $22,000.\n\n## How likely or unlikely does this answer seem to be?\n\nThe answer appears unlikely.

{"text": "The book that Jordan lost was the one at the end of the row, and it was the last one he reached before he found the one he lost. Therefore, E would be the correct answer.\n\n### Input. \n\nJordan and Perry took a boat to the lake to go  fishing on a Monday. Jordan caught 4  fish and  Perry\ncaught double what Jordan caught.  On the way back to  shore, the boat tilted over and they lost  one fourth of their total catch.  How many fish remain? \n\n### Response. \n\nIf Jordan caught 4 fish then he caught 5/5 fish in total. Perry caught 2/3 of the fish, so he caught 5/9 of the grand total. If they lost 1/4, then 5/9 - 1/4, or 1.5/9, or 16% of the fish. They lost a little more than a fifth of the fish.\n\nThere were 11 total fish, so the answer is 11-16%=8.25 fish.\n\n### Task Analysis\n\n### Instructions:\n\nInput:\nJordan and  Perry took a boat out  to the lake  to go fishing  on a  Monday  morning.

We could also use this to solve proportions and make ratios. When you make ratios in a toy factory it is often very difficult to know about the different toys that are being made. However, we could find the ratio between each price and see what profit is made or what is the price per toy. If the toys are all identical then there is no profit and that is also reflected in the ratio table.

Fungi would have to produce enzymes in order to break down the molecules of cheese. Milk from which cheese is made is the exact same material that fungi uses to grow in the living.

Because of all the nutrients, fungi is unable to use the calcium phosphates of cheese because cheese is mainly composed of calcium phosphates.

What is the probability of picking a ball and being unable to guess if it is red or blue, given that the ball is one of the first 6 picked?\n```\n## \n```\nSolution: If you have no clues as to color after the first 6 attempts, then it must be 1/5 (i.e., 1 in 5 or 20% chance it's red or blue after 6 attempts); thus, the probability of the ball not being red or blue after the first 6 picks is 4/5.

{"text": "C\n### Demonstion:\nJohn's RV does not have power.  John would need to stop at a rest area or at a building to plug in and charge his RV with electricity.\n### Question:\nInput:If 1/4 of 3/8 of a number is 5/32, what is 7/104 of the number?\nAnswer: 0.006\n\n### Demostration:\nIn this question, we are given 1/4 of a number, then are told what remains once 1/4 of the number is subtracted.  If the remainder is 5/302, then 4/40 of the original number was subtracted.  Therefore, 4/40 is the quotient of 1/4 of which number?\n\n### Question:What if the decimal place is different?\n\n### Demos\nIf we are given a number with a decimal place different than its dividend, the answer is the quotient of the original dividend multiplied by the original divisor.  For instance: 432/19 = 22.327\nWhen we multiply the quotient (22.32) by the divisor (9) the result is the dividend divided down to the dividend's decimal place.  Thus, (432*9) = 3832.808 = 3833.\n\n### Question\nIn this question, the answer includes a decimal in it's whole number quotient and a decimal answer in the remainder.  Because the dividend (130/8) yields a remainder in the whole number quotient of 3, the remainder equals 23/8, since that is what our remainder was after rounding the quotient.  Then the answer to the question is 339/8, which also contains a decimal answer.\n\n### \n\n## Explanation of task\n\nIn an attempt to have students develop reasoning skills and an intuitive understanding of multiplication (and then of division), I give students sets of equations for several tasks. The first four tasks are ones that I can fairly readily answer with the given information.  I hope that the answers will encourage students to make connections between different types of equations, such as those involving", "answer": "D: rest area"}

{"text": "Choices:  A  (back entrance) B (side entrance) C (main entrance ) D (anterior entrance) E (front entrance)\n\n### Instructor's Comments:\n\nThe purpose of this task is to identify how different programmers approach the task.  One way to understand how a programmer approaches a given task is by looking at how they respond compared to the correct answer.  This task requires the response to consider the choices in terms of whether they might result in certain persons reaching the destination. \n\nThis task also tests whether developers can think systematically to identify a best solution.  Each respondent is asked to respond to the same task, which requires that every response is evaluated against the standard (the correct answer) to determine how efficiently and effectively each respondent thought to solve this problem (which is to identify the best course given constraints).\n\nThis is a programming problem with a logic and algorithmic solution.  It involves using a given set of rules to formulate a process that will result in the respondent arriving at a given destination in the shortest time.  In this task the respondent is asked to reach the front entrance. \n\n### Comments on Correct Response:\n\nThe respondent provided the best response given the choice list.  The respondent correctly evaluated the choices and made a logical choice consistent with how they are described in the question: A, B would result in the person proceeding to the back entrance rather than the front entrance.  C, D, and E would result in the person reaching the front entrance.  Thus C is the most likely choice given that each of the other choices is inconsistent with how the choices are described.\n\nThis item also involved a level of understanding of how the choices are interpreted.  If we are using the back entrance and we want to leave by using the side entrance, are we going in the right direction or the wrong direction?  The respondent reasoned correctly, the respondent understands that each of the other three choices would result in the respondent making the wrong choice because they do not reach the front entrance using them.\n\nThis task is not intended to test the ability to solve an original problem.  Rather, this task is designed to examine how effectively various developers respond using predefined criteria to identify the correct choice.\n\n### Comment on Incorrect Responses:\n\nThe respondents who chose A and/or B were", "answer": "B: main"}

In this context, when people say \u201cNorth America\u201d they are referring to the countries of United States and Canada \u2013 which, together also make the continent of North America. Given that the context is America and that we are talking about a coastline, option D is incorrect \u2013 the North American coastline would refer to the ocean, not the countries.\n\n### In terms of geography and topography, the coastal areas of this continent are usually known as either East Coast, West Coast or Gulf Coast. \n\n### Therefore the answer would be: A \u2013 the state of Maine \u2013 the only \u201ccoastal town\u201d in the answer options. \n\n## Input:\n\nWe want to find where we are at sea level.  What was the average elevation of the land when the great glaciers retreated?  What is the elevation of Mt. Everest and Hawaii?  Which island was found in 1609?  What is the average elevation of North America?\n\n## Response:\n\nWe already know the answer to the question of what the average elevation of land in North America is.  We know that when the great glaciors retreated, they left mountain ranges, so we can assume that their average elevation is around that height.  We do know the average elevation of Mt Everest and Hawaii.  Mt. Everest is 5.6 million feet high, or around 8800 feet; I think Hawaii\u2019s volcano is around 4000 feet tall.\n\nSo then the question becomes:\n\nWhat elevation does North America\u2019s land have after the great glaciers come back down?

If there are 9 birds and 11 eggs in the nest, what is the smallest number that could be the number of eggs in the largest allowable nest?\n\n### Response.\n\nThe answer is 7.\n\n### Explanation.\n\nFirst, look at the even number of birds.  The least amount of birds in the largest allowable amount is 1. If we have 1 then we have 10, which is an odd number, because it is even plus 1. That leaves an odd number of birds. Then we can use the same thing to look at the odd number of eggs. If we look at it as 5 eggs, it is an odd number, the even number of birds is 3, which means we can have 4 more birds. Now we know we can have 7.\n\nThe most that can be in the nest is 9 birds. For all the other options we can do the same equation, look at least amount and figure it out from there.\n\n### Credit to the teacher:\n\nThe teacher.", "answer": "E: school"}

{"text": "- Answer: D\n- Justification:D\n\n- Answer: D : Concert\n- Justification:The speaker is talking about a place for recording purposes which would be a concert hall. Since stocks trade online, it would not make any sense for these stocks trade on the floor and get broadcasted to millions of people if there is another place for broadcasting the news. However, if it was a concert, there are so many places where the event can be recorded or happen where stocks can be broadcasted. The speaker is using stocks to get the students in the room to focus on the idea which means that the stocks are broadcasted. The best place it could be would be a concert hall because most concerts are done out in the open. Also, there is a high chance that the audience member would be there to record in the first place.\n\n- Answer: B\n- Justification:A the market is broadcasted to people, B, Concert hall is somewhere people could also be. The last thing the speaker wants is for the students in the room, to be somewhere where they know a lot of people or there are a lot people coming and going. B and C can also be an answer even.\n\n- Answer : B\n- Justification :The speaker is talking about doing something that has a lot of people coming in. It does not make any sense for her to go to recording studios. So C is the best answer and she is using stocks to describe what she is talking about. She wants the room to use their best judgment because she does not want to make their brain think about stocks. So the best answer would be a place where many people can be walking in and out.\n\n- Answer B\n- Justification B: Since the speaker is talking about a stock market and wants us to focus on the subject, she would probably not go to a place where there are a lot of people coming and going if she is using stocks an an analogy. A and C would also be a choice.\n\n- Answer E\n- Justification: It does not make any since for the speaker to use stocks as an analogy for microphones if she is going to a studio or an open place where there is a lot of people coming. So the best answer for this is E because the speaker does not want us too much thinking about stocks and wants us not to make any connections with other things so she", "answer": "A: new york"}

Run `npm run deploy` to push the new JSON to the cloud.\n1.

You can't change the response to \"I don't like your website because...\" because it's the only acceptable response. \n1. Your response must be no longer than 1 sentence. You can't say \"No way, your website sucks. The colors remind me of the color selection process at the DMV.\"\n1. You can only provide a total of three answers per day.\n1. The examples are all based on the US because I don't know about the other states.\n1. You should not provide the same answer more than once.\n### How Tasks Work:\nOne of the main ideas behind these examples is that you can't break the tasks down into several smaller problems. For example:\nYou should be able to get the task/response pairs by yourself, even if you have to use a dictionary.\nThe task/response pairs are all separated by a single space. The responses cannot rely on punctuation (a,!). For example,! is not a valid response here because it's not a single word. The response must be 'I'm not a spammer! I'm a real bot!' not'I\\'m not a spammer!'\nThe responses can be as long as they need to be. They should be a single sentence though, and should make sense. They can't be completely random, either", "answer": "E: mexico"}

Because the way your code is structured, every program is going to return one answer with the same variable name. If you want to handle that, you'll have to do something about that variable.\n\nComment: There is a very good answer here that gives you tips on how to write the program using proper input - input.py and output.py - and Pythonic variable name and variable scoping.  (Also, you've asked for multiple answers but you really should pick one, for a chance of getting a good answer!)\n\nComment: So the problem with your code (aside from the variable names) is that your output function only consumes a single variable. To do what you're after, you need to accept a single variable as input from `input` and write back a _dictionary_ of output to `output`. See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4991375/how-do-you-create-nested-dictionary-in-python) for info on how to do that. That said this way you'll need to rename your variable in other places, but that's easy enough.\n\nComment:", "answer": "D: doors and windows"}

The janitor's pail is a pail, which is a container used mostly to hold water. He got the pail out of the utility closet, which most likely had a washing machine, dryer, shelves, and a broom in it. Maybe he also had a mop too and in the utility closet. There is also a chance there is also a toilet in the utility closet, but it's unlikely. The janitor probably couldn't get his big can and the janitor's paddle out of the utility closets, so he would be stuck without any sort of broom or mop to clean his hallway floors. He's not going to be able to clean anything without a pail, a paddle, or a wiring kit. Without those items, he won't be able to clean the floors.\n\n### Input\n\nThis should be out of the kitchen. The janitor is probably making his pail out of his big can. There are a lot of reasons the janitor is probably making out of his big can, but one of them is because it is probably the cheapest option available. There is also a possibility that the janitor got his paddle out of Sanda's office, but it is more likely that the janitor got it out of the utility closer and Sanda got it out of the kitchen. Sanda may have used his paddle too make the broom that is in the kitchen, but it is more possible that she doesn't even exist.\n\n### Response\n\n### Input and Response\n\n\n### Instructions:\n\nWrite at least 5 complete sentences, each with at least 10 words, in your response, referring to 3 different resources, which include at least 1 scholarly source that provides a unique, insightful, or different viewpoint.

{"text": "The correct answer is \"d\": careful.  A careful person will not take foolhardy risks.  Therefore, another word synonymous with careful, meaning cautious, is the opposite of a foolhardy act.\n\n### Answer:E\n\n### Input : Which of the four following sentences includes a run-on sentence?\n\n* A: The movie was long enough for all five of us to go to the bathroom.\n* B: I have to find a new place to live and new school to go to.\n* C: I want a bigger house with more bedrooms, and I want a trampoline in the back yard.\n* D: I want a bigger home with four bathrooms so everyone can take showers after practice at the same time.\n* E: My friends, Melissa and Mary, and I have been watching it over and over again for the last five days.\n\n### Response : The correct answer is \"A\".  \nThe underlined part of \"A\" uses an adjective to modify a noun, so this sentence is a compound sentence.  The underlined part of \"C\" and \"E\" uses a subordinate conjunction to connect an independent clause to a dependent clause, so this sentence is not a run-on sentence.  Only \"B\" uses only an adverb-verb combination to connect two independent clauses together.\n\nThe sentence \"B\" contains two independent clauses. A run-on sentence contains two independent clauses not properly separated by a semicolon, a comma, or a conjunction.\n\nA compound sentence is the combination of two or more sentences and can only consist of two independent clauses, one or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.\n\n### Output: My mom\u2019s car is three times as old as my dad's car.

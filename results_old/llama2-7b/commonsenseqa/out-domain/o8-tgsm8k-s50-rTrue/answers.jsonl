{"text": "B\n\n#### Response:B\n\n## Other Solutions\n\n### Input 1:\n\nIf Hurley is 15 years old, and the sum of their combined ages equals 120, that means Richard's age is 50 or 43 years old\n\n### Input2\n\nFrom the question, we know that in the event that Brad left the group, each person that is left will need to pay 40 dollars more than the price of the car. However, we were able to assume that the cost of the car was 1200 dollars, and there were 6 people in the group to share the cost of the car, so 6/1200 =.05 = 5 dollars per person. Then, the total cost of the car would be 6*5 or 30 dollars per person.\n\nAfter the addition of the price for the car wash, then you can subtract it off to find the total price remaining, which is:\n\n1250-500 = 750$\n\nThen dividing this price by the number of people left to make up the difference will give you a total that each person must pay:\n\n$750/6 = $<<750/6=125>>125\n\n### Input3\n\nSo after $70 are spent on cakes, you can figure out how many cakes are made from that by removing 5 cakes from the number 70, and there are 50 eggs remaining.\n\nThis means that you are looking for 50/5= 10 cakes. So then to figure out how much is earned from selling cakes, take what is left from the 3400:\n\n2400-10*$20 would mean you earn 2400-$200-$20\n\nSo the total earned from the sale of cakes would be:\n\n$2400-$320-$20 = $<<2460620>>320\n\n### Input4\n\nFrom the $2960 available after splitting the cost between them both, John could buy 2960/135 = 22 slices of pizza, while Sam could buy 32/", "answer": "B: plane"}

The width of the rectangle is 8. If the area of the rectangle is 96 square units, describe the rectangular shape that has the given coordinates?\n## Rationales: The rectangle is described using the given equation. It states that length=12 and width=8. This tells us the dimensions of the rectangle. This rectangle has an area of 8*12 units^2 in the units given. That would make the area, 96 units^2. The length of the rectangle is 12 and the width is 8, so each unit on the length of the rectangle equals to 1 unit on the width of the rectangle. Thus, the area will be the product of the unit of the lengths and the width. 96=area, (1*w)*(1*12), 96=w*(1*12),  96=12*8, 96=96, 8^2+12^2=96, square root of (45-144)=4, or the side lengths of 4 units and 5 units.

However, whenever I would assign you a math problem in math class, you would get stuck.  What was it about doing math that was so difficult for you?\n\n### Input1:\nWhenever you do math problems, one part that always seems to leave you scratching your head is the step to translate the English into mathematical symbols.  For example, for the following equation:\n\n$$4 + \\frac{3}{7}$$\n\nyou need to be able to determine which letters refer to which numbers.  This translates to:\n\n$$4+37^{-1}$$\n\nwith $4$ referred to $\\text{4}$.\n\n### Input2:\nIn order for you to be able to better understand math and be able to complete it, you must first learn to translate English words into mathematical terms and vice-versa.  This translation is called mathematical language translation.  It is a process that includes identifying the numbers, writing them as symbols, and expressing them in mathematical equations.\n\n### Input3:\nIn mathematics, the letter \"x\" is used to represent an unknown number that is often unknown to the student solving the word problem.  The value of x can be found by using mathematical operations.  The letter \"n\" is also used to represent an unknown quantity which is also unknown to the student solving a word problem.\n\n### Problem4:\nHere is another example of mathematical language translation. \n\n$$2+3+4+\\frac{3}{7}+8-\\frac{3}{4}$$\n\nThis is the same as writing it in language:\n\n$$2\u00d7\\frac{3}{7} + 3\u00d7\\frac{30}{7} + 4+ \\frac{3}{4} + 8$$\n\nTo complete the step to algebraic expression, use the following steps:\n\n1.

Instead, it can be interpreted as a verb. Verbs are action words. Thus, the best answer is the word \"eat\", \"feel\" is an emotion. Emotions may be associated with what we taste. However, it seems that taste is the verb.\n\nTherefore the option E should be chosen as the response.\n\n## Instructions Explanation\nThe first step of building a task that involves multiple choice question is to write a sentence that states the question.\n```python\nquestion = \"What is the number of the month that ends with 'ruary'?\"\n\n```\nFrom the sentence that we have created, we can extract the question that we will ask our chatbot in the text form that is to be asked by our chatbot.\n```python\ninput = \"What is the month that ends with _ruary_?\"\n\n```\nWe can see in the sentence above, an underscore('_') has been inserted in between 'ruary' and '_ruary'.

I guess the reason why is because the other options are ambiguous too!\n\n### Process: After analyzing the options, I thought maybe the option that it was saying that something is ambiguous may be a mistake. In reality it may have been stating that I will take her home is an example of an ambiguous sentence and therefore there are two answers!\n\n### Rationales: \u201cambiguous\u201d does indeed stand for two answers. However, the author actually wanted to take her home is a metaphor to be taken literally.\n\n### Processing: \u201cI want to take a walk is an example of a metaphor\u201d; a walk is not a direct and literal description of something which is why it is a metaphor. \n\nAnother example would be \u201cI want to take my wife's house is an example of a sentence that uses ellipses.\u201d \n\nAnother would be \u201cI want my new friend to spend the night is an ambiguous sentence  because if you wanted to spend the night with someone as in a sleepover or going to a hotel, it could mean they are your friend and you want to stay with them which is an invitation to someone to stay over. Or you could want to spend the night with them metaphorically which means you want to stay connected to them but not literally like a sleepover or hotel or anything like that. But one is more likely than the other.

All of the choices besides B do not seem to be related to the person\u2019s abilities. Choice A seems to be the only choice that is related to a person\u2019s abilities since a person needs legs to cross a street.\nIt is unlikely to be choice B because a person generally cannot stand upright unless they have at least two working legs.\n\n### Input:(C and D) Find the value if x is 2 and y is 5. Choices:  A) 6 B) 16 C) 36 D) 76\n\n### Response (D)\n\n### Explansation:\nIf x is 2 and the value of y is 5, then x + 5 = 7 + 5 = <<7+5=12>>\nFrom this problem, it is unlikely for a person to have a +2 or +1 value for one of the x or y values.\nHowever, the problem requires the value for x to be 2, which will yield y to be 5.

If she can expect to live only half as long as a 25-year-old male, how many years of life can she expect?\n* A: 15\n* B: 10\n* C: 12.5\n* D: 16\n* E: 80\n\n### Response/Answer:  A: 15.\n\n### Input and Rationale:\nWe need to find the difference between the age of the 60-years old of a female to the age of 25 years old of a male. We can have a difference of 35 (35 years of a difference in the age from 25 years old to 60 years old) if the age is 25-60.\nWe subtract the age from 60 years to 25 years and get 35 years of age.\nBut, we need to know the expected age for a female.\nThe expected age of a female 70-75 and the difference is 5 years more compared with males. (70-75 = 15)\n\nBut, the difference in life expectancy (number of years) is larger than difference in the age.\nTherefore, 15 years is needed to 70-71 (to make it smaller).\nTo calculate the expected age, multiplying 15 by two which is the difference we need minus 1, we can get the answer of 30 years.\nThe expected life expectancy for a female is 70 and subtract 15 (years needed to make it smaller)-35 (difference in age as explained above) we get 64.5 (65).\nHence the expected life expectancy for female is 64.5 years.\n\nThe life expectancy which is given as 15 years to half less of a male.\nFrom 15 (year to half less of a female) to 64.5:\n(15 / 2)X64.", "answer": "B: singing"}

{"text": "Place all items marked A, B, C, D, and E into categories. Place antique stores in Category A and junk yards in Category D. The graveyard does not have a proper waste disposal method, so place it in Category C.\n\n### Input\n#### Demonstration: 20 people signed up to participate in a race around the school. 12 people were going to run the 5k and 6 people were going to run with backpacks.  The backpack runners were going to carry 20lbs backpacks.  In addition to the pack weight, each person had to run the course with their normal shoes.  However, 1 person didn\u2019t show up for the race and after the race the race director realized that each runner had weighed themselves before the race to get weight accurate.  By looking at the weights (50 lbs, 40 lbs, 35 lbs, 20 lbs and 30 lbs), what are the total weights of the backpackers, 5k runners and all participants together?\n\n#### Rationales: Start by first making sure that you are looking at weight per person and then also making sure that backpack weight is added to each persons weight. If there were 20 people originally, then 1 person not showing up doesn\u2019t change the total.\nSo we have 5 runners, 4 pack runners, 1 with no pack and 1 with no run- all together are 5+4+1+1 = <<5+4+1=11>>  Since we don\u2019t see the weight of the one that didn\u2019t show up, we don\u2019t know if it is in the pack or not.  So add on 10lb for backpack weigh from all, and 10 + 10 = <<10+10=20>>\nSo 20lb backpack plus 20lb shoe plus 50lb bodyweight of the runner = 70lb each runner\n50 plus 20 plus 70 = <<50+20=70>> 70 packs each with 20lb = 1400lb\n\n\n\n### Inputs:Each week, Bubba and his classmates get rewards for", "answer": "D: junk yard"}

To help with counting Ralph had to look at the calculator in order to count without being able to count without thinking of the numbers of his fingers.\n\nRalph didn't want to count.  He wanted to use numbers in his calculator. He wanted 10 fingers so when he saw 10 fingers he would put 10 on his calculator.\n\nRalph was using number one finger to put the numbers in his calculator which is ten but he didn't want to put all 10 on one side so he used two fingers to put the numbers one and one.\n\n### Solution\n\n### Input and Rationales\nJennifer couldn't find 20+8 as quickly as 10+5 or 15+2 because of their shapes.\n\n### Answer: 10+5\n\n### Solution:\nThe first reason was that Jennifer's favorite shape was the shape of 20+8, but 20+8 was a square so she found that hard to recognize.\n\nThe second reason was that Jennifer noticed her two fingers where 10 and 5 were and when she did the addition in her head she found both of those numbers first.

They are probably just driving, so there is not enough information to make this choice. There are people outside at the bus stop (A). \n\n3. The sign says that there is an accident ahead, so the other cars are probably also waiting for something. They could also be just driving through on the road (B). This choice is not clear enough. It could be the street corner, because at the corner there is likely a curb. But it could also be the bus stop. (A)\n\n4. The sign says no food, so this is not a place to get food. However, if the line is long, there are probably cars parked. So this choice could also be a restaurant where people are parking to get something at the restaurant. \n\n5. The sign does not tell us anything about whether people are waiting for something on this corner. It could be the bus stop, where people could be waiting. Otherwise, it could also be the street corner where people could be waiting to get to a bus, which is different from waiting to catch a ride in a car. Or it could be the roadblock, which is a possible parking location.  \n\n6. The sign says no entry, but it could also mean to not enter the area. It could also mean no entry to cars.

Pablo is going to college now and needs to make money, and he decides to rent the house to people.\n\nRationales:\nAfter Pablo\u2019s mother gets better, she is still not able to take care of her sister in a few years, so Pablo is going to rent the house out.\n\nHe then tells the neighbors that the house that is for rent is the house that his widow mother doesn\u2019t want to care for anymore.\n\nThis will get the current renters moving out if the current renters are already paying a really high rent.\n\nThe renters are still not moving out of the house, so Pablo starts to think of an idea.\n\nPablo starts to think of something.\nFinally Pablo figures it out:\n\n#### 14\nAnswer: \nWhen Pablo sees the light bulb go on, he starts to take apart his home.\nHe then discovers that the newborn baby girl is a wizard.

For each additional item sold, his yearly income per item sold increased by $1. If a customer buys more than one item, the number of items bought is not counted. What is his income for the second year in purchasing the 10,000 items?\n\nRationales: The more items he sells,the more money he receives; for example, 10+1 =<<10+1=11>>11 he gets 11$. If he sells 1000 more for his 2nd year and 1000 = 1000 so he gets $1000 and the money increased by $1=<<1000+1=1001>>1001 so he'll receive 1001 after he sells 1 item; therefore, if he sells 11 =<<11=12>>1 item, he'll receive $12+$1=<<12+1=13>>13$12+1=<<12+$1=13>>$12+1 for the 3rd year =<<13=14>>$13+1 for the 4\nRationale: He receives 13$ then he gets 1 + 1/1000 + 1 = <<1+1/1001=1000>>$1+1/11000\n\nAnswer:\n\n### Input :\nInput: A group plan for travelers covers 19 people.

{"text": "Let $A$ be the briefcase and $B$ be the coffee cup\n\nWhen we consider whether we have a briefcase, we would say we have a $+$ symbol in our briefcase. If we had it with us, we will know that it is a $+$ symbol.\nIf we consider whether we have coffee in a $B$ container, the same idea would be to consider whether we have a $+$ or $-$ symbol.\nGiven the information that we choose to use a briefcase, what did we do to indicate that we have a $+$ in our briefcase? A briefcase is a good thing for us to use if we want to travel because it can contain many things that are very important. We can bring it because it is very convenient and can help us quickly find what we are looking for when traveling. A briefcase is usually small enough to take with us. When we can take it with us, we know whether we have other things that we are bringing with us. Briefcases usually contain one, but when we choose to bring additional items, we bring an additional container and label it a $B$ to keep it separate from our briefcase. We can also attach a handle to our briefcase. The handle helps us carry it when we are walking, running, or driving.\n#### \nAnswer: C\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple question.\n\n## Demonstration Answer:If you are 3 times as old as your son, how old will you be when he is 8 times as old as you?\n\n#### 3*\n\n## Task Answer:Mr. A is 3 times as old is to as her son.

To me, I will learn again to get more experiences and more knowledge.\n\n### Input\uff1a\nYou have a car washing business.\nYou know in the past a certain amount of people was going to buy a car, but now they are choosing to use a rental vehicle.\nYou do not know how many people will be choosing the vehicle now that rentals are an option. But the total amount of people who are renting a vehicle are 75.  Including the 10 people that still own their own cars.\nTo make an effort to try to increase your car wash sales, you decide to have a sale for cars with a price of $225 a vehicle when you wash their car.\nChoose a letter that is the best alternative for:\nA: Increase sales by 8.  The additional people will keep using their car because it is less expensive to wash your own vehicle.\nB: Decrease sales by 1.  This is because of the additional cost per person for the people renting a vehicle.\nC: Increase sale by 90%.  This is because more people will use the car wash because the cost of renting a vehicle is much higher and the more people that drive, the less likely to crash.\nD: No impact.  The sales stay the same since there is a large variety of people who use their car as normal and rent a vehicle to drive.\nE: More people that rent are less likely to wash their own car so sales will drop by 40%.\n\n### \n### Response: As I think E is the best alternative.\n\n### Answer:\nIn my opinion, E is the best alternative choice because it is less likely that a renter will wash or do the required maintenance on their car if they have the option of cheaper rental vehicles.\nI believe that people renting cars have less interest in maintaining and washing the cars, this will make the increase of rentals will decrease sales to 40%.\nI believe that an increase of 10 people is likely to increase sales because a lot of people in America either rent or share car rides.  So a rise in the amount of people renting cars won't change anything.\nI don\u2019t think an increase", "answer": "D: graduate"}

Answer the question, and then solve using substitution.\n\n### Solution\n\n$\\require{enclose} $\n$\\begin{split} $2 \\cdot 0.25\\\\ = $0.50.\n\\end{split}_$\n\nOr, we can substitute and multiply, but it\u2019s not necessary:\n```$2 \\cdot \\frac{0.25}{1}$\\\\ = $1 \\cdot 0.5$.\n```\n\n### Reworking\n\nA task is just one equation. To solve a task, you have to convert it into an equation like, <math>\\text{Price} \\cdot \\text{$Quantity$} = \\text{Amount}\\text{.}\\qquad  (\\ce{Price <=> Amount})</math>.\n\nYou can do that by asking the question, and then asking yourself what $quantity$ was asked.\n\nThe key here is thinking: \u201cWait, how do I get from the question to the $Price$ <", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

Then, that person gets an additional number. The new total possible outcomes is now 5.\n\nThe way to look for a number that follows a number that proceeds it is by checking each position in the group and applying the previous logic for that group position.\nFor example, for the first group position, we have 4, and all of it's possible predecessors are in the group. No more numbers in that position will work.\nFor the second group position, that number is 5, all of the possible predecessors for it will work, for example: 5, 4, 3, or 2. \nThus, each position will have 1 more number that follows a number in it (not including the one that was added to the first position).\nWe can calculate this, because for each position we can find the max possible number that precedes it, and then subtract that number to find out the new possible number that could be added. Thus, any number greater than the max possible number from the first position, and", "answer": "A: curiosity"}

Socks and jeans go in the washing machine.\n\n\n\n### Rationales:\nSocks and jeans go in a washing machine because a washing machine has a drum, which is a rotating cylindrical container for washing clothes, dishes, etcetera and there is water inside the washing machine. That is why it is called a washing machine.\nSocks are usually inside the washing machine so you can do them with jeans.  Jeans don\u2019t come with their own washing machine, but you can get them washed as well. You can get them washed at the laundromat, at home in the washing machine, at a closet, at the shopping mall, and at the clothing store.  You cannot buy jeans in the clothing store because clothing stores sell clothes, so jeans would not be in the clothing store.

A large number of people, such as the citizens in the United States of America, have two numbers related to their ages.  One is the integer part of the number, which is all whole numbers. For example, in 45-years old, the integer part is 45.  The other number is the fractional part, which involves the remainder after dividing the age by 100. For example, in a 45-year-old person\u2019s age, the fractional part is one half of the remainder when dividing the age by four, in this case, one half of the remainder of 6 equals two. If the fractional part is more than one, which of the following describes the fractional part?\n\n#### \n\n#### 1\nThere is a fractional part less than one. (true)\n\n#### 2\nThere is a fraction part more than one. (false)\n\n#### \nChoice E \n#### 3\nThe fractional part is more or equal to one. (false) \n\n### Explanation: I chose choice C, because it said the fractional part is equal to 0.5, which is equal to 1/2. Because it is equal to 1, this answer choice is correct. The whole sentence read, \"the fractional part is more equal to one\". It didn't say \"is equal to one\". It said \"is more equal to one\".

As demand increases for something, supply and price rise alongside it.\nIn economics, in order to have an increase in supply, the quantity has to match the price.\nHowever, in our example, 70/1314 * 5%= 70+5 = 79\n\n### Output:\nIn order to achieve the desired savings of $819 in one year, the monthly savings should be $819/12=$<<819/1314=62>>62\n\n\nInstruction : After they went to the movie theater, Adam and Sam went to the grocery store.

They must be open-minded about things and learn about them, as not being open-minded may prevent someone from ever learning in the first place. Another thing is the excitement you may feel after learning a science concept. After studying what makes you happy, you might feel like you want to accomplish something new every single day to feel happy. You may even just feel as if you need to learn more science every day to feel this way. You may also feel knowledgeable about a certain science concept and have your opinion change and get another point of view from another person.

Fred was wearing a red shirt.  Mary was wearing a green shirt.  How many people were in the car if at least three people were wearing something other than the car?\n\n### Response (with no spaces):One\n\n### Rationale:\nYou are asked how many people were in the CAR. The number of people in the car depends upon the GREEN vs RED shirts. So if GREEN=RED=1, then 1/3 or 1/3=1. If GREEN=GREEN=0 and RED=RED=1, there ar only 2 so 2/3 or 2/3=2. So the only answer which satisfies this condition is one.\n\n#### Answer:\nBased on the given context, two people can be assumed as Mary and Fred (given that both of them are wearing colors other than the car itself i.e. green and red). The number of people in car = 2/3 = 1.\n\nHowever be careful for any other wording that can confuse your answer - if the question said \"How many people were in the red shirt if at least three people...\".

They plan on cooking hamburgers for 20 people. They bought 6 lbs. of ground beef with 25% lean beef.

If the total amount spent is $156.45 for a book order, how many books were ordered if the discount was applied?\n\n### Response (answer): There is no answer. \n\n### Rationales:\nWe cannot tell if the price was discounted or not.\n\n### If the response is \"there is no answer\" then proceed to the next problem. \n\n## Input:  When a store is running a 10% off sale, the discount is only applied to the original price of the item and not the tax. If the original price of the book is $12.37 and the city tax for books is $0.52, then what is the final book price?\n\n## Response:  Answer: 12.82\n\n## Rationales:  Because they are applying the tax after the discount, the tax will not be discounted. Thus, the total amount paid will be 12.37+0.52 instead of 12.38 because you can subtract the 0.01 to get.01.\n\n### Answer (response): 12.89\n\n### Ratiation:\nWe are told that we are getting a 10% rebate for books, so if we were buying 10 books then we would get a 10% of what we spend, but we are also told that their local sales tax is 8%. However, we did not get an 8% discount because we only got 10% off the initial price, so all we got was the price without tax. If we had the 8% instead of the 10% discout, but we had the same amount of rebates, we would get 8% of the original cost, which is 8*8.37 = <<8*8.35=66>>66 cent.

Which action makes the most sense?\n\n#### Response: He could have called the store and asked them to call the restaurant so the restaurant would have time to prepare for him.\n\n#### Demo:\n\nA. Talk to everyone at the same time. The bus takes 22 minutes to arrive at the nearest town while the cars take 15 minutes to arrive. That means he will be 7 minutes early if he waits in the car, and he will be late if he takes the bus. So he should wait in the car.\n\nB. Have a conversation with the restaurant staff at the same time. He can drive to the restaurant the same way he would have driven to the town. He already called ahead to the restaurant, so he knows they are expecting him and have enough food for him. It is just a question of whether he will arrive at 1:50 or 1:57. Since the bus is so much slower than the car, he should drive, then call and tell them the time of his arrival.\n\n#### Input :The man wanted to talk to both the restaurant and the store simultaneously.  He had no cell service so he called 800-FREE-411 (for US residents only) and waited", "answer": "A: sitting down"}

{"text": "Because the body requires a sufficient supply of water and salts,  fluid intake and urination are major bodily functions.  In order to have effective urination, a full bladder is required which is a sign of sufficient fluid intake.  The same is true for a full stomach. \n\n### Rationales:As an addict, one cannot depend on fluid intake because it is not constant and it is not reliable.  A urine test can give a false negative for alcoholics or drug users who know how to dilute their urine.  Saliva testing is being phased out because it can give false positives.  Urine and saliva testing can be evaded by eating certain foods and drinking certain diuretics prior to testing.  The need for sleep and relaxation can be mistaken as a need for recreational substances, especially if a person already has a history of drug/alcohol abuse. \n\nFor fluid needs, the only reliable way of meeting this need is to take water pills to induce diuresis.  If a person is using laxatives, they could have a false positive urine test for illicit drugs used to dilute a person's urine or a false positive for other drugs. \n\n\n---\n\nIf you have done enough practice with this lesson, you can click the [Quiz](https://github.com/jiazhixin/coding-practice-exercise/blob/main/exercise_9_2.md) to take your quiz.", "answer": "B: expend energy"}

Or at least that they believe that god would not want people to eat other living things.\n### Conclusion\n\n### Reasons:\nReason 1: Eating plants.  The reason they eat plants is because they are living things.  This means that plants are not plants as there are many plants that can take the lives of people and other animal species.  I believe this because I am of a mind that these are living beings and they are not food.\n### Reason 2: Gain wealth.  This is a good reason.  I am not sure what is meant by \"gain wealth,\" but I think it is something to the effect that they save more money by doing this instead of spending it on food.  The reasons for this are because if you eat plants, then you can eat anything you like.  So you would not have to save up money to buy meat.\n### Reasons\nReason 3: Eat hamburgers.  The reasoning for this is that not all vegetarians don't eat meat.  Some eat only a little bit of it.  This is because they do not eat meat, they just don't see themselves as a meat eater.  These vegetarians feel that they are being good citizens and that meat-eating people are not being good citizens.  I believe this is because animals are living, breathing beings, so they should be treated with respect.\n### Conclusions\nThe conclusion is that vegetarians eat plants.", "answer": "E: eat plants"}

How much did the book cost in the first place?\n\nYours response:\n$2\n```\n### Rationales\nThe cost of a book that is payed for later would be more than if the book is paid for immediately. Paying $5 for a present that originally cost $3 is $3 + $2 for paying for the book later, so the total cost is $3+2 = <<3+2=5>>\n\n### Rationals\n```text\nThe book costs $40 if i pay $45 today.

(Groceries cost $1/pound)\n```\n### 110\nSolution for first problem: $45 / 46 = <<45/46=0.98>>0.98\nSo you pay $0.98 X 40 = $<<0.98*40=38,2>>38,2\nYou spend $0.98 on groceries tomorrow, for a total of -$0.98= $<<-0.98=110>>110\n\n### 38,2\nSolution for the second problem: 10/100=<<10/10=0.1>>0.1\n\nSo you spend $0.1/pound = 40 x 0.1 = <<40*0.1=4>>4 pounds of groceries tomorrow\n\n#### 110\nAnswer: -110\n\n#### 38,20\nAnswer: 0.98/46 = <<", "answer": "B: closed"}

Letter E (shelf) has all your books but no dishes. Letters B, C and D are all food-storing places, but the answer is a place where dishes are mostly stored, and not stored next to books.\n\n### Rationales: In this problem, it is given that a person usually stores dishes (in the given choices A: apartment, B: pantry, C: table, D: living room, and E: shelf) but not books. Books cannot be stored in a pantry at all, so D (living room) cannot be an option. Since the pantry is a place where dishware is located, letter B is the answer. A person usually places dishware that he or she uses (plates, mugs, glassware, cookware pot and pan, etc) for meals on a table or in a cabinet. The options B and A (in the given choices), describe food-storing places (the pantry and the apartment) and B is the closest. A would also be an option because the apartment might be used for meals or to store food. E (shelf) does not include dishes, so the letter is not used. The letter C (table) refers to eating (that means food items are used) and not storing food (that means there might not be dishes present or books next to it).

The handle was at the top of the door, and it had a glass bubble just below the door handle. I thought this would be a very cool place to hang out, but I didn't really know why.\n\nI was looking over the books with my best friend, Olivia, when I said, \"There was this old house at the library that had a very strange door. The handle was on the top, and it had a picture of a man and his dog in it, and a bubbly manhole in the middle. It also had these blue glowing stones around it. It was one of the most interesting doors I had ever seen!\"\n\n\"Really, I hadn't paid much attention to that door as it was fairly drab. It looks very odd in person. Why would this door be so interesting to you? It's probably just some kind of random, dumb thing. I can't imagine why it would be interesting to you,\" Olivia scoffed.\n\nI rolled my eyes at Olivia then said, \"Oh, get over yourself, just because my eyes do not wander often does not mean those objects are not worth seeing. I would describe it as having a face on the front, as a large picture, with a strange little picture under the handle below. I wish I could see what is under the glass on this door, the glowing stones could be diamonds.\"\nThen she continued, \"Well, I can't really imagine what it could have been to you. It just looks like a normal thing to me. Like, why did you think it was so cool? It's just a door! I just have to say the handle should be above the door, not on top of the door.

He takes two trips to get the gallon of ice cream. The distances from the ice cream shop to Mary\u2019s house and Mary\u2019s babysitter\u2019s house are both 3 miles. How much further is it for John to get back to his house from the ice cream store than it is for Mary to make either trip?\n\n## Response: The two gallon of ice creams John brings back to his house weigh twice as much as any of the trips Mary need to make. Thus, John's trips will take longer than Mary's.  The trips Mary makes to her babysitter's and to her house each are 3 miles, so she makes 3/2 = <<3/2=1.5>> miles each.  John's first trip from his house to the ice creme store is 2 miles long,  and his second trip to bring ice cream home is double that length; thus, John went 2 + <<2+2>>4 miles.\n\n### Rationales: Input: The distance from Sam's house to the ice-cream shop is two miles to each side. He takes two trios of ice cream home. One is for his brother but does not give him any ice-cream. The other is two cups of ice cream and two scoop of ice-cream which he eats himself. The distance from the ice-cream to the school is 4 miles, to his brother's class is 8 miles, and to his niece's a day-care is 10 miles away. How many miles does he have to walk to the grocery store?\n\n### Rationale: Sam went to school the distance from the ice-house, 8 miles. Because he does not share the second trip, which contains 2 cups and 2 scoops and would weigh twice as much, his trips must be taking twice as long. So he walked the extra miles that the first trip took over 8 miles.\n\n## Instruction:In the story, there are two characters. What is the difference between their", "answer": "C: repair shop"}

That is because, I would either travel to another place or come back from it and because it has luggage that would make my travel comfortable.\n\n### Rational:Airports transport people from one place to another.

Traveling somewhere could involve carrying luggage to a hotel and also taking luggage home with us.  We could not do these things without bags.

{"text": "A.\n\n### Rationales:\n\nThis is a very specific, yes I would say, rude question, but I find that in life you must sometimes ask and answer awkward or uncomfortable questions. I can tell you that this question was from the SAT. I chose A, because I think that A is the only choice that could describe the person answering the question as a winner when trying to procreate.\n\nIn A, you also have to remember that \"procreation\" is a very specific word, which means literally \"to bring into the world.\" This word doesn't apply to other words that may have similar meanings like \"have children\" because in this context they are specifically looking for a winner that has had children. Also, it only has to do with procreation through the act of having sex with a person and not through other other medical procedures like in vitro fertilization or the use of artificial insemination.\n\nI think anyone who answers \"have children\" or \"rewarded,\" are saying the child produced is their \"success\" which I think isn't exactly what is being asked.\n\n### Input\n\nThis question is talking about the number of cars that people are driving to work. We can know this because they've mentioned public transportation. The question is asking us to use this information from the text to predict the answer to #8.\n\n#### 8\nAnswer\n\n### InputThe passage in question 8 talks about the number of cars people use to get to work.

{"text": "#### Response: \n\n### Rationale: \n\nThere are many types of places where an event or reception could be held. Each answer has pros and cons. However, in deciding where to hold a reception. \nOne needs to analyze the location in terms of: \nThe size of the area \nThe type of reception \nThe number of people \nThe budget\nThe size of the space will greatly effect what can be accomplished. Smaller rooms may not be able to fit all the people invited or if the event is a large reception, it may be too expensive for the number of people there. \nThe type of event will effect how much space a room requires. A meeting or small discussion may be held in a smaller room with less space dedicated to the reception. \nA large reception may also require a larger space depending on the type of event. \nThe size of a group will determine how much space is needed. A smaller group can be easily fit in a small area. However a large group may take up a different portion of the area. \nA reception may also have a time limit or not. \nIf the event is a fundraiser, a country club, casino, or restaurant may be the best place to hold the event as they may be willing to donate or pay more for a service in exchange for tax exemption.\nWhile a banquet hall may be too expencive for the type of reception that is desired, a restaurant or country club may be able to be rented out or paid for.\nAlthough a restaurant may be a less expensive place to hold an event, they may not be willing to donate the service as some country clubs and nonprofits may. \nThe lobby or entrance of a nonprofit could be the best place to host a reception, as it would not cost anything to receive funds. \nHowever renting or preparing food may need to come from the funds received from the organization instead of the people who were invited and are attending.", "answer": "B: large room"}

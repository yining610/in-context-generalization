The game consisted of six holes and a team that consisted of four people. Each player had their turn and their score at each hole, and for all six holes on their first nine. These scores, ranging from the best on one hole to the worst on another, added up to make a score per hole, then a score for each hole of the game. To end the game a score is given for each hole of the round, then this score is added to the score of each of the six rounds. If there are differences in the scores, the highest number is subtracted from the lowest number. Write a response for this scenario that provides the input and output.\n\n### Answer\n\n\nInput: There is a game of golf with six holes per round. There are multiple people on each team, and it is a team-based game. With each hole, players can score on the lowest number with a total score of 6596 for the round. If there is more than 6596, subtract the lowest score from the highest score in the game.\n\nOutput: Game play occurs per hole. A given match goes for one round, and that round has holes. After each round, there is a low score and a high score. After that, you can subtract the lowest score from any of the other scores. This will give you the score for each game.", "answer": "B: subdivision"}

His manager was kind enough to ask him to give them an update of what he did while he was out of the office. He was expecting for the manager to tell him something good, but instead all he got was a list of every task that was completed that week. Now, Michael feels that the manager did not actually care about how he was doing, and he is starting to question the motives behind this whole thing. He thinks that this may have something to do with the manager getting to keep that great-looking office that Michael always wanted.\n### Outcome:\nWhile the manager's intention was to show that the project was going well, the person they wanted to tell how the project was going was not actually that person. If this was the goal of the person telling many people about the project, they would be better off by telling the person in charge. This way, they can directly address any issues that came up and avoid them from coming up again in the future. If the manager was just looking for someone to tell about the good news, then they can choose to tell anyone since they want to share their positive news instead of receiving any negative feedback.\n### Reason:\nThe goal of telling many people may be to show the project is moving along.

For example, this sentence has no capitalization. The first word is \"It\" and the rest of the word is lowercase. This is important because if we capitalized the word, \"It\", it would create a better flow. Grammar is important because capitalization helps to make sentences look more organized and clear by separating the word into its parts. The more organized the sentence, the easier it is for people to read it.\nThe example on the previous slide shows how important proper capitalization is to the readability of the material.\nGrammar is important in society because it makes sentences structurally correct. It ensures that the written material is coherent and readable, which is important in our lives because communication is a fundamental component to everyday life.\"\n\n### Response:\"Grammar is a very important tool, when being used or taught to children growing up, as it plays a key part in the process of creating coherent sentences.

Grammar also allows us to see how and why certain sentences can be created using nouns pronouns adjectives and adverbs, these components, though small in size, have big effects on the overall meaning and sound of the sentence. So, if someone is unable to create coherent sentences, we wouldn't have anything coherent to read and thus be unable to understand.\n### Input:Which sentence is punctuated correctly?\nA. \"When was the last time you went to the movies?\"\nB. \"When was the las you went to the movie?\"\nC. \"When was the lase you went the movies?\"\nA..B..C..\n### Response::A\n### Instructions:\n### Answers:\n\n### Input:`Please go the checkout page to complete your order and make payment.`\n\n### Response:`I have no idea what's this is, I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter.\n`", "answer": "A: good health"}

{"text": "The answer would be D: car\n\n### Explanation:\nA Safeway sells food, not vinyl records. Safeway is a Supermarket and I think would be where I would buy most of my food from, since some safety's do sell books. I think B would be a Record Store, but a lot of record stores only sell collectibles of music from the 00s and 90s. Some record stores may sell things like vinyl or collectibles but that is not common. Finding a record store that only sells vinyl is a lot harder than finding them. I went to thriftbooks and it said there was a section for music CD's but no vinyl. I did not think there were any used vinyl shops at thriftbooks. And a record album is a box of CD's, so that's not the answer. C: record store might be a record store, but it is a bit off the path as it would depend on if the record store sells used vinyls or not. I don't think used vinyls are a lot cheaper than a new record album but they are cheaper than a new CD. E is another common music shop to buy records from but I don't think most people buy records from a wallpaper company. And a wallpaper company would not sell records for cheaper then other places, because that would make no sense. So D is the answer is record shops because records are cheaper here then at other places.\n\n### Input 2: Choose one of the following options to complete the statement. Option A.

A fraction can be seen as the division of two whole numbers. There are many types of fractions. For example, the fraction\n\n$$\\frac{3}{5}$$\n\nmeans three parts out of five parts,\n\n$$\\frac{\\frac{3}{5}}{5}$$\n\nequals $\\frac{18}{60}$.\n\nAll of the numbers in a fraction are called the numerator (denoted by ${n}$), and the number on the bottom is called the denominator. To simplify a fraction, get the denominator and numerator equal, which is done by dividing the numerator by the denominator. For example,\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\\frac{2}{3} & = \\frac{2\\div3}{3\\div3}\\\\[4pt] & = \\frac{1}{3}\\\\[4pt]\\end{align*}$$\n\nDecimals are a comparison of places we use to separate decimals by a decimal point. This allows us to place more numbers in fractions and gives fractions more precise measurements. Since decimals have zero fractions we have the need to create non-whole numbers for fractions. Fractions have a numerator (denoted as ${n}$), a denominator (denoted as $d$), and a decimal point. If you place a number after the decimal point, it is called a decimal value. For example,\nthe number \n\n$$0.789$$\n\nis a decimal, and the number \n\n$$\\begin {array}{} \\frac{{0.789}}{1}\\\\ \\end {array} $$\n\nis a fraction.\n\nTo place a decimal point where it belongs, in a place value in the hundredths place, in the thousandths place, or in the hundred", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

In addition, people around them do not give them the confidence to try and correct them. Furthermore, the student may not know the meaning of this language so they do not know how to correct their mistake. As a result, people around them might cause misunderstanding. This misunderstanding is uncomfortable for the student and causes frustration that can affect the student for the rest of the school year.\n\n### Input :What about your grandfather?

After infecting a victim, they enter the host cell and begin to replicate.\n\nThe virus is the only microorganism that can infect the animal and plants as these are the two living host cells that can be attacked from the inside of the living cell and eventually reproduce. Viruses can survive by attacking the host cell's structure and alter its normal functioning, they are paradoxical organism that cause infections in its host cell.\n\nReplication includes  the processes they follow inside the cell, including the processes of copying their genetic material. They do not have their own metabolism making them extremely simple organisms.\n\nThey are responsible for infections as they attack their host cell or virus causing a variety of severe or mild illnesses. Some of the viruses affecting the human beings are influenza, human immunodeficiency virus, the common cold, Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella-zoster virus.\n\nOther sources also provide information that is related.\n\nReplication can be understood in the way they produce copies of themselves during reproduction. It can be understood in terms of their mode of attachment in the host cell and the process of budding after the cell division.\n\nIn the process of replicating the virus copies, they do not have a nutrient source. This means that they need help from the cell in which they are reproduced in order to survive.\n\nSome viruses can be transferred as infectious entities in nature by contact from an infected person to another or from an infected animal or insect to another.\n\nThe primary role of the viruses, being reproduced in infected living host cells, is to produce copies or multiply themselves inside those cells.\n\nThe virus begins replicating, and as it grows and gets bigger inside the host cell, it can also mutate and evolve. Eventually, its membrane is damaged by the new virus particles created.\n\n### Input:-A:\nT", "answer": "A: infect"}

{"text": "Choices: C: require obedienced A: drill Bspoon E: spoon A: drill\n\n### Explanation:Carpenters work wood to meet their clients' specifications. They are trained to use a wide range of tools that shape and cut wood. A hammer and chisel, a drill and drill bits, and a saw and file are some things that a carpenter may use to build a piece of furniture to specifications. They may also require clients to obey building codes and adhere to building laws. A woodworker may require clients to understand the basics of working with wood. While carpenters focus on finishing projects with materials, they also pay attention to the size, type, and texture of the surfaces they are working with. They may use a variety of tools, such as a pencil with an eraser, to make the work more precise. Woodworkers may also be instructed to use other materials, such as spikes, screws, and chisels to complete projects. Woodworking is a process that requires dedication and practice. It requires a certain degree of dedication to finish projects. It also requires a great amount of detail to be exact. For example, a small-scale project may require a hammer and a chisel, while an enormous project may require a large amount of expertise and knowledge. In addition, carpenters may be required to use spoon for a range of tasks. While they may have to be skilled in cutting boards, painting, and assembling furniture, they may be required to be knowledgeable about installing windows, building garages, and making furniture. When woodworking, carpenters may also be required to obey building codes and understand the terms of a contract. While carpenters have to be skilled at understanding how to build a project, they may also be required to be knowledge about working with tools. In addition, woodworkers may also have to have access to a variety of tools, including screws, screws, chisels, and hammers. While a carpenter may not be required to have a degree in woodworking, woodworkers may be required to be skilled in a range of techniques and tools.\n\n### Input :What are the ingredients to make a delicious pizza?Choices: A: tomato B: sauce C", "answer": "A: drill"}

{"text": "Correct, this is a question to check your understanding of how to approach a code golfing problem.\n\n### Answer to the above question\n\n### Demostration:\nFor example, the following code would work for:\n\nInput: A large number N that is divisible by 5 and 13. What is the remainder?\n\nOutput: 1\n\nInput: A small number N that is divisibble by 5 and 6. What is the remainder, if any?\n\nOutput: Nothing\n\n### Answer:\nSometimes the question you're being asked seems like it could be answered using a for loop, a while loop, a do while loop, or maybe using multiple loops. But for code golf, we have to use only one of these and it needs to be the fastest.\n\n\n### Demos:\nExamples:\n**For loops:**\n\nInput: There is a house with 10 bedrooms each with 15 pillows in it. How many pillows are there in total if we count every pillow?\n\nOutput: There is a house that has 10 bedrooms and each of those have 15 pillows. There are a total of 10*15 pillows in the house.\n\n**While loops:**\n\n- Input : A man needs to water his garden. There were 3 plants that needed watering and each are 5 feet apart. How many feet did the man walk back and forth to water the garden?\n- Output: A man needs to water the garden. There are 3 plants that are 5 feet apart and the man must water each plant. The man walks back and forth from the first plant, then he plants a little further and water the next plant. This is repeated 3 times.\n- Solutiton\n- 75 feet = 5 feet * 15 steps.\n  \n**Do/while loops:**\n\nIn the while loop, the condition is checked and if it is false, the program exits. A do/while does not do this. The do/while loop checks the condition at the beginning and then does the statement after the while loop. But this while loop, I would just use:\n\n```javascript\n\ndo {\n    if (condition) {}\n }while(condition)\n\n```", "answer": "D: somber"}

It says that you should make friends when you feel lonely. In order to figure out the most appropriate response, it is very important to understand the context. It is obvious that the context is when a person is feeling lonely.\n\nLoneliness can be felt due to many reasons. One of these reasons is missing friends and family. Therefore, the appropriate response is to call or hang out with them.\n\nOne can hang out with people that he misses by meeting people. This action might make a person less lonely, because when people are around they can talk freely and have fun with others. When a person has fun with them he also becomes happier and thus loneliness is less felt.\n\nThe input does not give enough details to come to a clear conclusion for selecting other possible answers.\n\n\nExpected response: meet people\nActual response: A is given as the correct answer.

How many apples are in the line when there is only one boy left?\n\n### Demostration:\nIf we subtract 35 from 4 x the number of Apples(40),we will get 4. The new boy will have an apple and there will be 36 apples in the line.\n\n### Response : There are 35 apples in the line if there is one boy left.\n\n### Example: One day, David woke up to find 5 bananas, 2 apples, and 1 orange in his bathroom; he ate one banana, two apples, and half an orange. After he ate, he found that he had 2 bananas, 4 apples, and 2 1/2 oranges left. How many appes were there originally?\n\nSolution:\n\nBecause the number of Banana,apples and orange are respectively in increasing order,so the total numbers of fruit should be in descending order.\nSo total number of fruits were 10.\n\nBecause he ate one banna, two apples that means now there would be 10 left. \nSo it becomes 9 + 10 = 19\n\n\nSo total number of fruit left 3. and half of it is still 2 apples.\n\nSo 10 - 3 = 7\n\n\nSo total apples are 2.and one of it is cut into half.So one apple is left.\n\n\n### Example 2: Five pairs of socks were hung on a line.

The game consisted of six holes and a team that consisted of four people. Each player had their turn and their score at each hole, and for all six holes on their first nine. These scores, ranging from the best on one hole to the worst on another, added up to make a score per hole, then a score for each hole of the game. To end the game a score is given for each hole of the round, then this score is added to the score of each of the six rounds. If there are differences in the scores, the highest number is subtracted from the lowest number. Write a response for this scenario that provides the input and output.<n><n>### Answer<n><n><n>Input: There is a game of golf with six holes per round. There are multiple people on each team, and it is a team-based game. With each hole, players can score on the lowest number with a total score of 6596 for the round. If there is more than 6596, subtract the lowest score from the highest score in the game.<n><n>Output: Game play occurs per hole. A given match goes for one round, and that round has holes. After each round, there is a low score and a high score. After that, you can subtract the lowest score from any of the other scores. This will give you the score for each game.<n><n><n>

But in this case, I could also solve this by using FOIL (the first word in the alphabet, that’s F.) I FOIL-ed both sides, and when I multiplied it out, I discovered 10n=598. This means that ten multipled by whatever number in n is 598.  It’s 598, divided by 10, which gives me 59.8, or the answer in the 3rd decimal! This is a super cool, quick, and easy trick to learn!!

His manager was kind enough to ask him to give them an update of what he did while he was out of the office. He was expecting for the manager to tell him something good, but instead all he got was a list of every task that was completed that week. Now, Michael feels that the manager did not actually care about how he was doing, and he is starting to question the motives behind this whole thing. He thinks that this may have something to do with the manager getting to keep that great-looking office that Michael always wanted.<n>### Outcome:<n>While the manager's intention was to show that the project was going well, the person they wanted to tell how the project was going was not actually that person. If this was the goal of the person telling many people about the project, they would be better off by telling the person in charge. This way, they can directly address any issues that came up and avoid them from coming up again in the future. If the manager was just looking for someone to tell about the good news, then they can choose to tell anyone since they want to share their positive news instead of receiving any negative feedback.<n>### Reason:<n>The goal of telling many people may be to show the project is moving along. However, it was more than likely that the goal of that someone was to tell the person in charge since the person in charge needs to know exactly how the project is going.<n><n>### Input<n>*What's your favorite kind of donut?* A: cake B: jelly C: cream filled D: raised E:  none of these<n><n>### Answer<n>None of these<n><n>## Solution<n>*None of these*<n><n>## Input:<n>*Johnny loves video games.*<n>*Amy likes video games too.*<n>*Video games aren't Johnny's favorite thing.*<n><n>## Outcome:<n>*Which one might be Johnny's favorite?*<n>*None of these.*<n><n>## Answer:<n>None of these<n>

So...maybe this is why it's not a good idea to wear it when traveling.<n>If you travel, and you keep jewellery in the same place as in your usual day, you might go back home and notice that it's missing. Of course if you wear everyday jewellery, I don't see what the problem is, I don't think that people steal it for this exact reason (maybe that's a matter of preference). But, if it is an expensive one...I don't think people are that greedy to steal something with high market value.<n><n>As you can see, I don't know if my answer fits the question, but I guess it's not safe to carry a jewelry in your handbag/purse when traveling, since any small bag can be stolen. So I think that, if you'll be traveling without your husband/wife, maybe you shouldn't carry any jewelry, to keep it safe from thieves.<n><n>### Input:(1) A.58 B.36 C.39 D.43 E.70<n><n>### Response:(1)C.39<n>I think 39 and 70 fit the best.

Choices:  A: library B: demonstration C: corner D: football ground E: rug<n><n>### Response:		<n>There could be any number of possibilities for the table to be in the house. However, for the table to be used properly, it needs to be in a space that is conducive for reading or doing homework. If the table is in the library, it will be taken up by shelves and books, or the couch if the library doubles as a living room. If the table is used in the living room, the rug may get in the way. In the corner of the house, the table could be blocked by the television and its accompanying furniture. Finally, the table would never be fit to be put in the football ground. It would be a waste of precious ground and a complete embarrassment to the members.<n><n>### Input:[B] Write another sentence that is a request to use the table to put a flower vase.<n><n>### Response:[B] If I had to use the table to hold a flower vase, the answer would be the living room. A flower vase will hold flowers. Flowers need sunlight and a place to be aesthetically pleasing, and a table can be placed in the living room to accommodate those needs. Furthermore, flowers don’t need to be in the corner, for it will block a clear path that can go into the dining zone. The flowers also don’t necessarily have to be in the hallway, for it can be blocking the door from the house. Therefore, the living room would be able to accommodate the needs for both the table and the flower vase.<n>

She does not know where to start on her homework. She also does not want to call her mom and ask for help because her mom is busy and is currently giving birth to Ann's baby sister. Ann knows that she has one hour left in math class. Should Ann call her mom to get help?<n><n>### Response D:<n><n>No, I would not recommend Anna to call her mom. Anna is trying to help herself out she should not rely on somebody to do her work for her. However, if her homework is too difficult to do alone she should call her mom.<n><n>### Option C:<n>The correct answer is 18886.3. That is correct because 1888 is the last two digits, 6, of the phone number the user entered and is less than 7, hence the sum of the two answers would be 1888 + 6 – 7 = 18887. When you use subtraction on 6 and 7 you get 1 so you have to add the answer 1888 to the answer you got from multiplying the number by 10 and adding the last two digits. <n><n>### Demos:<n>What if the user didn’t want the sum but rather the two digits that are in the last position of the number the user entered?<n><n>### Input 2751<n><n>### Response 751

Choices:  A: safeway B: record albums C: record store D: car E: wallpaper<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer would be D: car<n><n>### Explanation:<n>A Safeway sells food, not vinyl records. Safeway is a Supermarket and I think would be where I would buy most of my food from, since some safety's do sell books. I think B would be a Record Store, but a lot of record stores only sell collectibles of music from the 00s and 90s. Some record stores may sell things like vinyl or collectibles but that is not common. Finding a record store that only sells vinyl is a lot harder than finding them. I went to thriftbooks and it said there was a section for music CD's but no vinyl. I did not think there were any used vinyl shops at thriftbooks. And a record album is a box of CD's, so that's not the answer. C: record store might be a record store, but it is a bit off the path as it would depend on if the record store sells used vinyls or not. I don't think used vinyls are a lot cheaper than a new record album but they are cheaper than a new CD. E is another common music shop to buy records from but I don't think most people buy records from a wallpaper company. And a wallpaper company would not sell records for cheaper then other places, because that would make no sense. So D is the answer is record shops because records are cheaper here then at other places.<n><n>### Input 2: Choose one of the following options to complete the statement. Option A.

The pasta it specifies both the broken and the full noodles. The both have 84 noodles so the amount of pasta broken

A fraction can be seen as the division of two whole numbers. There are many types of fractions. For example, the fraction<n><n>$$\frac{3}{5}$$<n><n>means three parts out of five parts,<n><n>$$\frac{\frac{3}{5}}{5}$$<n><n>equals $\frac{18}{60}$.<n><n>All of the numbers in a fraction are called the numerator (denoted by ${n}$), and the number on the bottom is called the denominator. To simplify a fraction, get the denominator and numerator equal, which is done by dividing the numerator by the denominator. For example,<n><n>$$\begin{align*}\frac{2}{3} & = \frac{2\div3}{3\div3}\\[4pt] & = \frac{1}{3}\\[4pt]\end{align*}$$<n><n>Decimals are a comparison of places we use to separate decimals by a decimal point. This allows us to place more numbers in fractions and gives fractions more precise measurements. Since decimals have zero fractions we have the need to create non-whole numbers for fractions. Fractions have a numerator (denoted as ${n}$), a denominator (denoted as $d$), and a decimal point. If you place a number after the decimal point, it is called a decimal value. For example,<n>the number <n><n>$$0.789$$<n><n>is a decimal, and the number <n><n>$$\begin {array}{} \frac{{0.789}}{1}\\ \end {array} $$<n><n>is a fraction.<n><n>To place a decimal point where it belongs, in a place value in the hundredths place, in the thousandths place, or in the hundred

Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?, Choices:  A: better communication B: overthinking C: frustration D: misunderstandings E: headaches<n><n>### Response:		Dear Mrs. Williams, Learning languages (in the school environment) is not easy, but I feel it is not impossible.  Even in a language immersion environment, there can still be confusion. In addition, people around them do not give them the confidence to try and correct them. Furthermore, the student may not know the meaning of this language so they do not know how to correct their mistake. As a result, people around them might cause misunderstanding. This misunderstanding is uncomfortable for the student and causes frustration that can affect the student for the rest of the school year.<n><n>### Input :What about your grandfather? Did he work with numbers his whole time?  How many years did he work in business?<n><n>### Response :  Dear Mrs. Williams I hope your daughter in the 2nd Grade is doing well.

What's the difference between real and moot court trials? How are they similar?<n><n>### Question:Did you find that experience helpful?<n><n><n><n>### Response <n><n>Dear Mrs. Williams,<n>I am glad to hear that your daughter is doing well this upcoming school year and hope she is having lots of fun at school. In regards to the question you asked today, I must say I do enjoy these questions you ask me on Monday. I am in favor of this idea especially on Monday mornings as it helps me be more prepared during the day. It's much more enjoyable than listening to a lecture on Mondays as it keeps me excited for the rest of the week and reminds me about the things I need to get done for the week. <n>Moot Court team? What a great opportunity for my legal studies class<n>. This term for my class sounds very interesting and can't wait to be part of it. This team looks like they are willing to provide me with a great opportunity as not only will it be a great learning environment and a chance to practice my skills I had attained during the year.

Choices:  A: infect B: reproduce C: mutate D: eat food E: make computer malfunction<n><n>### Response:		<n>A. Viruses can be defined as a microorganism that has the ability to infect living host cells and survive and replicate within them. They can be divided into two main forms; viruses that attack animals and viruses that can attack bacterium.<n><n>Infectious viruses can be characterized by their ability to multiply or replicate within living organism. After infecting a victim, they enter the host cell and begin to replicate.<n><n>The virus is the only microorganism that can infect the animal and plants as these are the two living host cells that can be attacked from the inside of the living cell and eventually reproduce. Viruses can survive by attacking the host cell's structure and alter its normal functioning, they are paradoxical organism that cause infections in its host cell.<n><n>Replication includes  the processes they follow inside the cell, including the processes of copying their genetic material. They do not have their own metabolism making them extremely simple organisms.<n><n>They are responsible for infections as they attack their host cell or virus causing a variety of severe or mild illnesses. Some of the viruses affecting the human beings are influenza, human immunodeficiency virus, the common cold, Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella-zoster virus.<n><n>Other sources also provide information that is related.<n><n>Replication can be understood in the way they produce copies of themselves during reproduction. It can be understood in terms of their mode of attachment in the host cell and the process of budding after the cell division.<n><n>In the process of replicating the virus copies, they do not have a nutrient source. This means that they need help from the cell in which they are reproduced in order to survive.<n><n>Some viruses can be transferred as infectious entities in nature by contact from an infected person to another or from an infected animal or insect to another.<n><n>The primary role of the viruses, being reproduced in infected living host cells, is to produce copies or multiply themselves inside those cells.<n><n>The virus begins replicating, and as it grows and gets bigger inside the host cell, it can also mutate and evolve. Eventually, its membrane is damaged by the new virus particles created.<n><n>### Input:-A:<n>T

Choices:  A: drill B: learn C: require obedience D: understand E: spoon<n><n>### Response:		Choices: C: require obedienced A: drill Bspoon E: spoon A: drill<n><n>### Explanation:Carpenters work wood to meet their clients' specifications. They are trained to use a wide range of tools that shape and cut wood. A hammer and chisel, a drill and drill bits, and a saw and file are some things that a carpenter may use to build a piece of furniture to specifications. They may also require clients to obey building codes and adhere to building laws. A woodworker may require clients to understand the basics of working with wood. While carpenters focus on finishing projects with materials, they also pay attention to the size, type, and texture of the surfaces they are working with.

I like to travel a lot, to know about different cultures and different people. I prefer the home vacation too, but it has less benefits as a oversea vacation, such as not learning something new, not know about foreign language and culture and not gain new friends. I think oversea vacation helps us to know how life is like in other countries. Not to mention that oversea vacation is a better way to know the country you live in, its nature and culture is better than you think.<n>

What is the remainder?<n><n>Output: 1<n><n>Input: A small number N that is divisibble by 5 and 6. What is the remainder, if any?<n><n>Output: Nothing<n><n>### Answer:<n>Sometimes the question you're being asked seems like it could be answered using a for loop, a while loop, a do while loop, or maybe using multiple loops. But for code golf, we have to use only one of these and it needs to be the fastest.<n><n><n>### Demos:<n>Examples:<n>**For loops:**<n><n>Input: There is a house with 10 bedrooms each with 15 pillows in it. How many pillows are there in total if we count every pillow?<n><n>Output: There is a house that has 10 bedrooms and each of those have 15 pillows. There are a total of 10*15 pillows in the house.<n><n>**While loops:**<n><n>- Input : A man needs to water his garden. There were 3 plants that needed watering and each are 5 feet apart. How many feet did the man walk back and forth to water the garden?<n>- Output: A man needs to water the garden. There are 3 plants that are 5 feet apart and the man must water each plant. The man walks back and forth from the first plant, then he plants a little further and water the next plant. This is repeated 3 times.<n>- Solutiton<n>- 75 feet = 5 feet * 15 steps.<n>  <n>**Do/while loops:**<n><n>In the while loop, the condition is checked and if it is false, the program exits. A do/while does not do this. The do/while loop checks the condition at the beginning and then does the statement after the while loop. But this while loop, I would just use:<n><n>```javascript<n><n>do {<n>    if (condition) {}<n> }while(condition)<n><n>```<n>

It says that you should make friends when you feel lonely. In order to figure out the most appropriate response, it is very important to understand the context. It is obvious that the context is when a person is feeling lonely.<n><n>Loneliness can be felt due to many reasons. One of these reasons is missing friends and family. Therefore, the appropriate response is to call or hang out with them.<n><n>One can hang out with people that he misses by meeting people. This action might make a person less lonely, because when people are around they can talk freely and have fun with others. When a person has fun with them he also becomes happier and thus loneliness is less felt.<n><n>The input does not give enough details to come to a clear conclusion for selecting other possible answers.<n><n><n>Expected response: meet people<n>Actual response: A is given as the correct answer.

After he ate, he found that he had 2 bananas, 4 apples, and 2 1/2 oranges left. How many appes were there originally?<n><n>Solution:<n><n>Because the number of Banana,apples and orange are respectively in increasing order,so the total numbers of fruit should be in descending order.<n>So total number of fruits were 10.<n><n>Because he ate one banna, two apples that means now there would be 10 left. <n>So it becomes 9 + 10 = 19<n><n><n>So total number of fruit left 3. and half of it is still 2 apples.<n><n>So 10 - 3 = 7<n><n><n>So total apples are 2.and one of it is cut into half.So one apple is left.<n><n><n>### Example 2: Five pairs of socks were hung on a line.

Finally, the above amount is being further subtracted with 466 to achieve 479.\n#### 6\nAnswer: Difference: 479\n\n### Input:-1024 + (-36)2 + 36% + (-2-1)/11 is +?\n\n### Response:-2118\n\n### Rationales:1) We begin with ( -1024 +(-36)2 ) +(36% +( -2-1)/10. Firstly, the difference between (-1024) and (36% is that (-1024 -36%)= <<-1024-36%= 178>> 178. Secondly, we multiply 178 with (0.3) which represents the 36%. Therefore, we have 57.04 which when rounded down, leaves us with 57.Next, we divide (-2-1)/(11). Here, we have a subtrations of a number after taking away 1 from -2. Hence, the equation becomes (2 - 1). Next, we divide by 11 from both sides. This leaves us with:- (11/2) - 1 = <<-9/2>>-4.

What is the value of the variable x?\n\n**Response: ** -11\n\nRATIONALE:\nThe first question was how many ways that we can find 1999999 by adding the digits of 813. Then we get 813 + 39 + 8 = 199984. The second is asking how many times does y + y = 2. If we add 11 to both sides, we get y + y = -9. The third is asking how many times x + x = -11. If we minus x from both sides, the answer should be 0 because there is no remainder. Then we have the two sides = -11. The variable is x because its a subtraction problem.\n\n###Input and Rationales\n\n**Input:What is 10000 / 22?**\n\n**Response:500**\n\nRATIONALED:\nThe question wants you to find the quotient of  10000 divided by 22. So in order to solve it, you need to know the difference between the dividend and the divisor. The dividend is 100, the divisor is 2. To add the result, you multiply them by some number and then solve for that number. Since the dividend is a zero in this problem, you can eliminate it and just do 500.\n\n**Input:The last term of", "answer": "A: being married"}

He knows he should ask for a response from HR managers in at least three different departments to have a good idea about which department overall has more sick leave. Which department should the manager survey first?\n\n### Response\nDepartment with the least sick leave\n\n### Rationales\nFrom the choices, they are all asking about number of employees or sick leave, but the question is talking about which department has more sick leaves.  This implies the manager is looking at percentages.  Choice C has nothing to do with percentages, and choice D is asking how much sick leave do employees take.  Choice B and C probably have the same amount of sick leaves, but since the question states to select \"one more or less than another choice\" then there should be difference between choices A and D. If both have the same amount of department \"X\" to choose from, the only choice that it is asking for is D.  If \"X\" has more than \"Y\" then that would be choice A.

{"text": "B\n### Answer:\nThe only choice that does not correlate with inebriation is 'talk nonsense' and therefore, does not reflect the state into which an individual would become. 'Talk nonsense' represents a state of speech that is unintelligible, so the remaining alternatives should not be eliminated.\n\nInstead, we need only see which responses do have a correlation with inebriation. To answer this, we need a common noun - 'drunk driving' is used, so we need a verb. There must be a verb. We need something that describes someone who is already drunk that has no relation to other people's speech; the only possible choice is (b).\n\n#### ##A (regret):\nIf I were to become inebriated, I may say regretful things, but that does not necessarily mean I would talk nonsense. If this was the case, the verb would have been used in the sentence, 'When you go to a party, you are more likely to say things you regretted the next day.'\n#### ##B (automobile accidents):\nIf I were intoxicated, I would not be driving, so this is not a part of the speech.\n#### ##C (drunk driving):\nThis clearly describes the state of someone who is drunk, but not what they say. This may be a form of talk nonsense if I had been driving. In this case, I would get arrested, not talk incoherently to someone in a bar.\n#### ##D (talk intelligently):\nThis is very much the opposite of talk nonsense, so not a viable choice.\n#### ##E (talk intelligently)\n\nThe only way in which I could remain intelligent is by knowing more or drinking less; in any other case, I would not be able to talk intelligently.\n\nAnswer:\n\n### Input : If you could only buy one dessert, but you have the opportunity to eat two, which dessert would you get?

The smell wouldn't be so bad if she wouldn't smell it.\nI chose choice A because A: perfume and C: swamp are two unpleasant smells.\nShe did mention to \"Just spray it\", so this means if she sprays herself with any smell, she will eventually smell it.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. A: perfume\n    1. perfume = smells nice\n    2. If perfume = smells bad, then A : perfume : smells bad.\n2. C: swamp\n   1. If B : water : smells nice, C : swamp : smells bad. \n3. D: air\n   1.

{"text": "A\n\n### Input 1:Is a dog's life better than a cat's?. Choices: A: yes B: no. C: sometimes D: what's a cat?. E: they can be\n\n### Rationales: A dog is the best animal to choose since it can be the best for everything. A dog can be better than a cat because it is helpful, intelligent, and friendly.\n\n### Input2:A group of scientists recently determined that a dog's brain is a lot more powerful than a cat's brain. Choices: A: this helps prove that the dog is more intelligent than the cat B: this helps prove that there is no difference between a cat's and a dog's brain C: this shows how stupid dogs are D: this is good news for all the stupid cats. E: the difference doesn't matter, since both have the intelligence to protect their owners\n\n### Rationale:\nDogs are not only the friendliest animals but also the most intelligent ones. We could trust them to take care of the whole house while we are not at home because dogs are very useful animals. It's impossible to keep a dog away until the home becomes a mess; therefore, we can hire dog services to take care of that. Dogs do not have only the duty to work out because they are very helpful to the owners. Additionally, dogs can play with a child, and it's a nice experience for the kids while we are at work. Dogs are helpful and useful at home, that's why they are the animals we can trust to help us.\n\n### Task:\nDuring the day when you are taking the dog to the park, you are not only a good friend but a wonderful teacher. The dog becomes the best company to have a good time; therefore, dogs do not only work out, but they help us to have fun. So, if you do not want dogs to work out and feel happy, they can be the best company for the whole day. So, they give us the best companionship while we are at work and taking care of the kids and the home. Dogs are the best animals for the whole day; therefore, they are the ones who can be at work and in our houses because they help us to relax and to have fun.\n\n### Reward\n```", "answer": "B: try to learn"}

So I\u2019m asking for some more clarity.\n\n### Note\nWe can see that the answer is A which says yes.\nTo clarify the above statement the answer is\n\n### Option A\nI understand that every meal we buy the total of is the same but the restaurant loses money. So if 6$ x 3 = 18$ and we buy the meals of amount 18$ then the total money is fixed. Then how does the restaurant lose money??\n\n### Input Three\nThe manager said that the total amount of every meal was the same but the restaurant lost all money on every meal because the amount of food purchased by each customer varies. The manager says that the restaurant lost $200 at each meal. What're the chances the restaurant made at least $200?\n\n### Option B\nI understand that every time the manager makes 200$ but every time we only make $6$. So every time he looses and so far for all meals he has lost 200$. So the amount of profit will be 200-. Which is just 200$\n\n### What I get confused with is that the total amount of food we buy is the same amount, for example meal 1 bought is 18$ then we only buy $6 in meal 2 and so on.\n\nThis is the explanation of \"What we get in our head is that we are actually buying every meal. Which is not what is happening as we only buy only a very less amount of food in each meal\".\n\nAs we buy the same amount of food at multiple places this creates multiple meals which are made up of total amount of food.\n\n### I would like to get one by one help with each problem.

We can see which streets have many bus stations in Australia. These maps will help you to find out where bus stations are most likely to be located.\nB: street would be a very convenient place for a bus terminal for the reason that most cities in Australia are surrounded by many streets that are good for travel by bus. It is also possible to arrange street bus stops without a bus station because buses do not need to enter one to continue traveling. Therefore, choosing a street to put a bus station would be a good idea.\n\nA: school\nBuses are great for getting you to school, work, and play. If children can take a bus, they can save time. That's why it's important to have a safe and convenient way to travel by bus. There are many places to get information and support on how to use bus services.

{"text": "Choice B\n\nIf you are searching for a fox in the woods, you could find one hunting in open meadows. The reason you might not find one in the wood is because they are on alert from the many predators that live in forests. The arctic tundra would also be a place a fox may look for a meal. They may not want to go too far from their den in the forest of course, but the tundra would be a safe place for a fox. When the snow is thick, they may be forced out if their prey of choice is not there due to the heavy snow packs. A beach is likely not a great place for many animals to hunt. They do not have the wide paths and ample space that many people do. When the weather is bad, they cannot even safely hunt in the woods without a fox hole. The beach is also typically very warm making it unfavorable for hunting as animals like to conserve energy and hunt for food when their prey is most active. The great outdoors has many places for animals to hunt. However, there are so many great hunters in the great outdoors hunting foxes, that foxes are on alert and have to stay very low. The best place for a fox to hunt while avoiding any potential harm is on the outskirts of the great outdoors. They may also hunt there due to the fact that it is more favorable hunting ground than most animals.\n\n### RESPONSE: A fox would rather live in a place where it is hard to find. If the woods where they live is surrounded by farms, they might not be the most safe. In an open meadow or great outdoor areas, they are a target.\nIf it's more hidden, easier to find food, and safer then that is a great place for an animal to live.", "answer": "A: open meadow"}

How much time is saved using this new machine?\n\nRationales: The same quality with lesser resources means fewer resources.\nTherefore, when the carpet manufacturer uses this new machine, it produces a carpet with lesser resources.\nTo solve, we first need to know how many resources are used to produce the carpet with the same quality using the old machine.\n1. The old machine: Carpets in unit quantity that takes the previous amount of resources (i.e. quantity with resources)\n2. New machine: Carpets that takes far lesser resources.\n\n1. Therefore, we can conclude that old machine = unit quantity, whereas new machine = far lesser resource.\n2. If the old machine takes resources amount \u2018r\u2018 to produce carpets of unit quantity, then we can say the old machine = resources amount \u2018r\u2018.\n3. And, if the new machine takes far lesser resources amount \u2018r,\u2019 then the new machine = far less units \u2018f\u2018.\n\n4. When the \u2018r\u2019 and \u2018f\u2019 are compared, we can conclude that the far lesser resources amount is a lot less than the previous.\n5. Therefore, when the carpet is produced with the resources difference of \u2018r-f,\u2019 we can conclude that the time saved with the use of the new machine is equal to \u2018r-f\u2019.\n\n\n#### 30000\nThe Carpet manufacturer saves 3000 units of unit resources.\n\n\n\nAnswer: * The carpet manufacturer saves 12.5 hours with the use of the machine.\n\n## Input\nInstructions:Write a response that accurately completes the request:\n\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions, each correct response may be used", "answer": "E: fatigue"}

{"text": "You are looking at seats that are either on a raised platform that is used for an elevated viewing position of a sport or concert, or seats that are low enough to where people can sit on the floor.\nThe operatic stage, like that of a theater, is a raised platform with seats surrounding it to view the action taking place. If an event does not occur on a platform, then the seating is lower since the platform allows for a distance from the event so people can sit below or around it.\nAlso, the theatrical stage is a raised platform because the actors and actresses need to be seen from the highest point in the venue so that they stand out. This also keeps them safe from the other participants since they remain elevated.\nAs for movies, people sit on bleachers at a low height. It gives the feeling of watching a show on a stage, which is why some choose to watch it on a couch at home. However, people can't see all of the action that occurs, so they typically come to the theater to attend the motion picture.\n#### Operas\nOperatic stages are like theatrical or movies stages, so C is a better option.\nIn response to choosing C, the student made an assertion concerning stage placements. They did not offer any supporting or opposing arguments as to why the placement might work better than the other choices offered.\n### Response:The placement of movies, operas, and theatrical productions have different reasons.\nFor instance, movies are low because the viewer can't see the entire action. Also, they are placed on couches. But operas and theatrical producers are on a raised platform so the actors and actresses can be seen from everywhere in a venue.\nThis was a very incomplete argument and did not include any counterarguments to back-up the assertion as to why these stage placements might be better than the other choices.\n### Response\nIn response to the initial question, the student's rationale is incorrect as it relies on a misconception about the purpose of a bleacher and what it is.\n\nBleachers are a style of seating that is commonly used in athletic arenas and gyms, but they can also be used elsewhere.\n\nBleacher seating gives two advantages that many stadiums need.

This variable is to be defined at beginning of the program by using 'j=0'.\nThen a condition is applied within the for loop. It states that the condition will be true if the variable \"j\" takes a value of 2. That's why the for loop evaluates to false because \"j\" takes a default value of 0. However when the condition is reached \"j\" will be set to 2 and the loop will break thus returning the program.\nTherefore in order for the program to be completed and for the output to be displayed the if statement should be in the \"else if\" condition rather than in the \"if\" condition.\n\n### Question\n\nInput: \n\n### Response\n\n### Question \nInput: \n### Response:", "answer": "C: late"}

{"text": "C\n### Reason:  There are many factors which can show a child\u2019s happiness. A child could be happy while he is playing or when he is not playing. Laughing in this case does not signify a child's happiness. It means a positive expression. When a child walks slowly, it shows that he is either sad or bored. The only thing which shows childhood is enjoying. A child walks happily enjoying something. So, if this happiness is of a kid playing, then the correct answer is a child is going to play!\n\n### A.\n\n### Reason\n- A person who laughs cannot be a child, unless it is a group of kids\n- A person who is happy is probably not walking slowly\n- A person sitting on the ground is either bored, or sad, or they are just sitting watching something\n- A person who could be enjoying something at this moment, is that person a child?\n\n### B.\n\n### Answer\n- Walking slowly is not enough to show happiness, a person who walks slowly could be sad or bored, or even it is a person who is angry or upset\n\n### C.\n\n- Kids usually walk happily while playing.

And finally, it increased again by \\$0.50  for two additional weeks.  Write an expression for the price of a banana. (Your answer should be in the form  p(x) where \"p\" is the function that represents the  price of a banana and \"x\" is the number of weeks since the first sale.  The expression should include all the cost increases.)  Example:   p0=2.50  p1=2.75  p2=3      Solution:  Let the number of weeks since\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis question is quite specific. I could answer it in more than one way but I am going to go with the method most often presented in the course.\n\nThere are three different formulas for the price of a given item or service in an equation like this. This question requires an equation with the number of weeks included not only in the rate of change, the absolute value of the change, or in the original cost. In this situation, you will include only the number of weeks in the formula.\n\nThe second question is about whether someone should urinate. Urinating is a sign of fear.\n\n#### 54 (The Price of Bananas, P2.50 for Two Weeks, and then P0.50 for Two Additional Weeks)\n\nWe would add the original cost and any rate of change at the same denominator:\n\n$$p(x)=2\\times2.50+3/2.50=5+\\sqrt(3)$$\n\nYou can do the same thing with the rate of change or with the absolute value of the rate of change:\n\n$$\\sqrt(5.25)=7$$\n\nYou would not expect to do a rate of change calculation without a rate of change or an absolute value.\n\nIn this problem, you use the denominator, which is the number of weeks, not the number of total dollars or the number of total bansanas.\n\n### Input\nQuestion:You can do something like this if you give a dog a cookie.

{"text": "I chose the second choice, but there can also be other choices, such as wind.\nIf Dan decided to run on the \"sun\" heat source, it would be a little costly but it would also bring a lot of benefits. The sun\u2019s energy is free and does not consume any fuels that would cost more eventually. By using the sun, we would help reduce the emissions and help our Earth, clean it. But, on the other side, if the weather is cloudy, that means less light and less heat coming in, so the heat would drop. The problem is that it is not a stable source of energy, that is why we don\u2019t go by that option. But, there\u2019s also the wood, coal and other heat sources that are not considered as renewable and they release carbon monoxide, they are more polluting, but they are more stable than the sun. A final choice for Dan would be the wind. The wind is a renewable energy that does not go out, its not a burning material or something, it\u2019s like a breeze and it can stay forever if we are able to use it.\n\n\n### Demand : How much would a person want to pay for a certain good if there was no such alternatives to that good.\n\n### Supply: How much would it cost to produce a certain good.\nThe demand curve is the upward slope that shows the quantity demanded to the price.\nIf the price increases, it would make the quantity demanded decline, but the shape of the curve would be the same still and the price increase would continue to happen.\nThe law of supply is the other curve that describes the relationship between the quantity supplied and the price. The price increase would continue to stay the same, but the quantity supplied would be higher.\nThe relationship is upward sloping, which means that if the supply goes up, so would the price as demand goes down.\nThe same thing happens the other way around, if the supply is higher, the price would grow and demand would grow also.", "answer": "B: solar energy"}

{"text": "| B |\n| --- |\n| The man left his luggage at the hotel. \n\n### Justification:\n\nAnswering Choice C is incorrect because the response says \u201csidewalk\u201d. Answering A is incorrect because the response doesn\u2019t make any reference to a bus stop while the instruction does.\nAnswering B is incorrect because the response only says the man \u201cleft\u201d the luggage but does not specifically refer to the hotel, which is one of the options.\nAnswering D is incorrect because the response does not specifically say the man or where the luggage is.

If the man is diagonally three squares away from the daughter and the daughter is diagonally  two and 1/3 squares away from the man, in what shape is the room?\n\n### Justifications:\n\nFirstly, it is important to note that in the original question, it stated the man was \u201cthree squares away\u201d from the daughter. This statement can be simplified to say the man was one row away, as one square is \u201cn\u201d rows by \u201cm\u201dcols, and \u201cn\u201d divides by \u201cm\u201d. In this case, n=3. We can then simplify this statement further to say the man was two rows away from the daughter. Now to the question.

E\n\nShoes are usually not that expensive nor worth wasting a lot of energy on.  Shoes can be quite comfortable and are much more ideal for running than nothing.  The shoe is actually a very smart solution; it has great effect on feet as it provides great comfort.  When feet are hurting from running on something hard, the solution is to pick up the shoe and wear it.\n\n### Rationale:\nLet's assume that a block is one mile long and Bob's house is right in the middle.\nFrom (4.4 miles), we can go as far as two blocks from the side of Bob's house to the opposite wall.\nThus, for Bob to travel 4 miles, he would have to travel a block, a block, and three blocks.\n1. If Bob travels a block further than he can without stopping, he won't be able to travel farther.

Choose the price in U.S. dollars that you would guess is furthest from the actual price. $$16.4$$, $<<17.2>>17.2, $39.8$, $<< 37.8>>37.8, and $43.7$$.\n\n### Response The Canadian dollar is at a ratio in which it is greater than the U.S. dollar. Given these options, the last price seems furthest from the current value. This is because if the ration was 7:6, that means that the U.S. would be at a value of <<$7 / $6 $7*6>>$7*6.

{"text": "Let me first tell you about the word energy; Energy is the work done on a system, or the quantity of work done on a system or the capacity for work in a given time. Energy may exist in two forms: (a) potential energy and (b) kinetic energy.\n\n**Work** is also defined as the process in which, one object's forces are applied from another object, such that the first object's motion is changed. In other words, for objects moving to different locations, and forces acting, one or more, or many of the forces can be considered as work.\n\n> The only energy needed for us to exercise is within us, not from the surroundings, and we use that energy to exercise.\nLet's see how energy is lost during exercise, and the energy obtained from exercise.\n\n1) **Energy lost during exercises**: During the exercise, we may sweat with the help of perspiration gland. When sweat comes out, it contains water, salts, lactate(acetic acid) and urea(carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen). Here only one part of energy is lost, the water(as weight lost) and energy(as sweat loss), and the rest of the energy are not lost, instead, the energy is required to maintain our internal functions such as blood circulation, breathing, digestion, and the muscles activity. This energy is recovered in the same way, it is through external source, from the air (as oxygen), food (as glycogen in the blood and liver).\n2) **Energy obtained from exercise**: In our activities, some energy is obtained from the surrounding environment. When we breathe, we move air in and out. The process in which gas(usually air) is moved in or out of lungs is known as respiration. Let me tell you what the process involves and its result:\n\nRespiration is a combination of two processes or reactions. First, inhalation: When we breathe in, air moves into the lungs, which are large, balloon-like structures in our chest cavity. Air moves into the lungs through one or both nostrils, mouth or an opening in the throat.\n\nSecond, is exhalation: When we exhale, the air leaves the lungs", "answer": "B: think"}

While this may refer to whether or not an individual can respond to an external action or event, it also refers to what an individual thinks about these events or things. For example, if an individual notices an earthquake, they may be not be aware of their existence (i.e. not respond) because they are in deep sleep; however, if someone who is awake is able to respond and notice the earthquake's existence, they have gained conscious of the event.

A decrease in the overall price that has occurred for an extended period is referred to as debasement.\nFundamental reasons for the deflation of prices include the following:\n\n1. a decrease in the money supply\n2. decreased demand and/or slower growth in overall demand\n\nWhen the money supply is reduced, the overall price level falls, resulting in a state of deflation. Deflation might also happen if the overall demand for products decreases, causing a decrease in the economy's overall growth rate.\nDemand-Pull Deflation\nAggregate demand is often defined as the total demand for products and services in the economy, as well as the aggregate value of the demand in the entire economy.\nAggregate demand can be divided into consumption, investment, government, and net exports. In an economy, the greater the overall demand for products and services, the higher the aggregate demand, which implies that prices are rising and the reverse is also true.\nDemand Deflation:\nWhen there is a decrease in overall demand in the economy, demand deflation occurs. This type of deflation is caused by a drop in the demand in businesses. When there is a decline in demand for goods and services, the economy's demand will fall, and consequently the economy's supply of products and services.\n\n### Output 2:\n\n### Demand:\n\n### Supply:\n\nA supply curve is a graphical representation that shows the amount of a product that suppliers are willing to offer for a given price, and over a particular period of time. Producers would offer more of their commodity at a given price in the following graph.\nA downward-sloping supply curve means that suppliers are ready to sell more at lower prices and vice-versa. A supply curve's shape does not, in fact, reflect the quantity of goods that producers intend to sell. On the contrary, it shows how much they are prepared to provide.\n\nA supply curve's horizontal shape indicates that the suppliers are willing to sell the same quantity of goods for any given price.

What number and percentage of people did not take an Aspirin during the four-week period? \n\n### Rationales:\nIf you choose to choose option:D, it is incorrect.\nTo find the number of people that did *not* take an Aspirin, you need to find the number of people who did take one during the previous 4 weeks.

Pacific Ocean**\nThe Pacific Ocean is the largest of the world's five oceans and covers almost a third of the Earth's surface. It is called the Pacific Ocean because Spanish explorers believed that they had sailed all the way from Cape Horn on the South American west coast to the Islands of the East Indies. They assumed that they had circumnavigated, or gone all the way around, the entire earth. The Spanish explorers were named \"Pedro Alvares Cabrillo\" and \"Ferdinand Magellan\" (the explores who first sailed west across the Pacific Ocean). The reason it is called the planet because it is the largest of the 5 oceans in the world and it is 3/4 (3/4) of the Earth`s surface. It is the only ocean that is larger than the entire continent of Africa.\n<br> <br> <br> **2.

This is the answer because the last year that was described is the year that the value increased by more than one thousand so the last year that was discussed was the most recent year and most amount of money. The year before that was shown in the example was the third year at the waterpark and the amount of money that was made was $4,900 more. The first year that the waterpark was mentioned on the question was the year before the", "answer": "C: body of water"}

{"text": "#### Answer: B\nAnswer: B\n\n### Input\nI was making my list for going to the market, my friend was with me. When it was my turn to take the item that my friend was holding. I took it and give it to him. But my friend was holding a similar item with another one which I took it, it was the second time while we are shopping now. It's now my turn to take what my friend has.

He handed me the first item then the second item, the item I handed him first was the one I was holding. Can you help me figure out was the item I had on my hand was a similar item as the item he got for me?\n\n### Response\nI think it must be the first one.\n\n### InputS:\nMy friend took another item and handed that new item to me. I looked at it and thought, wow I have never seen this item before. The reason that I think that it must be a new item is because he passed his previous similar item to the next person and the new item looks to be similar to the one that he handed to me. He handed me a similar item that I put on the table. He was having a problem with the same item that we were both looking for. He decided to try to find a different similar item that he thought he have never seen before. The item looked like the one I was looking for. My friend took the similar item I put on the table and gave me the other similar item on the table, which is similar to the item he handed me. The item that was on the table that I put the table was the one he was looking at, and the item he was holding when he handed me was the one I was looking at as well. It is confusing to figure out how the items looked different to me from where I put the table. I think there were two similar items and he handed me the other one and then the first item.\n\n### ResponseA:\n\nAs you have mentioned that you have not seen the new item before. But there is a possibility that you have seen that before.

The man claims to own a copy of Microsoft PowerPoint and he asks you if it's a program he would use at home. In response, you say the following to the man: \"No sir, if you're looking for a home user version then you would have to find PowerPoint Home and Business. A home version of your program for regular consumers is called Office 365, but that is intended for office work, whereas Microsoft PowerPoint is for presentations. If you don't need Office 365 then you probably want PowerPoint instead.\" Afterwards you proceed to ask the man if he was indeed willing to find something like PowerPoint Home and Business since you know he's not looking for a home consumer version of Microsoft PowerPoint. In response, the man says he is in fact looking for PowerPoint Home and Business, which you then point out to the man. Do you agree that it is correct to say that the man was willing to find PowerPoint Home & Business and is now looking for that specific program?\n\n### Response.\nThe man asked for the home version, which meant  he wanted PowerPoint Home & Business, so yes.\n\n#### 96\n### Input:You're baking a cake and you need to know how many eggs you need to make it.

Banks, a dentist, wanted to test the distribution of his patients' toothbrush use. After giving each patient a toothbrush, he instructed them to use their toothbrush five times a week for seven weeks. Then he asked them to tell him how many months they had purchased toothbrushes before getting the one from his practice. If a toothbrush typically costs $2 to purchase, how many months did Dr. Banks test the toothbrushes (the test period)?\nRationales: Dr. Banks bought his patients 53 tooth brushes in January and 67 in February, the total number of toothbrushes is 53 + 53 = 166 + 67 = <<166+67=233>>233 tooth brush.\nThe time of use is from January-May = January  + Febuary plus + March plus + April plus+ May. So the total time of use =<<January + February + March + April + May = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15>>15 weeks\nand Dr Banks asks the patient about the period of use ( the test period). The patient tells Dr Banks the tooth brush they used had 20 months and 1 month remaining to use the toothbrush.\nSo the Dr Banks' test period = 5 weeks-(20 months-1month) = 2 months\nSo 233 toothbrush(s) were distributed to the patient for two months.

She knows that when a skier accelerates from rest, the coefficient of friction with the ice is 0.7. How fast must the engineer skate to keep her momentum constant if the engineer's mass is 72.8 kg, and she is rolling down the hill at 13.1 m/s?\n\n### Demisturation:\nSuppose the engineer is skating at a constant velocity. Let's assume it is at the start of the hill. Then the engineer will initially accelerate at a rate of 9.6 m/s^2, until she reaches the crest of the hill, at which point she reaches constant velocity until she turns around and heads back up the hill (the force of gravity acting upon her will cause her to accelerate upwards.) Note that she will accelerate to her initial velocity, 13.1/t in which [n]=[initial downward velocity].\n(9.6m/s^2)*(72.8kg)*(t*sin(i)*0.7)*(0.7)*0.15 =[initial downward velocity]\n\nThis is the rate at which the object accelerates.\n\n### Answer:\n(13.1/(-3.141*((0.7/13.1)*(9.6m/(t-13.1)*0.7)*72.8/13.1*(1)*0.15))) = <<13.1/((((0.7/9.6)*72.8)/((1)*0.1)(t-13.3)(0.7)))>>(3.141/(9.6*72.8/(((1)*0.7)^(t-13.4)*0.1*(1)*(0.7)+(0.7)/((1)*0.(15-7.4))))))\n\nNote that in the denominator is 0.7/(((1)*((0.1)/(16.8*((0.7)/(((1)+(15-7.5)))))))) This is simply the skier going down", "answer": "E: feelings"}

Whereas, a toy store is a place of fantasy, fun, happiness, and creativity. There is rarely if ever any stress and worry because there are not assignments and expectations, however there is still school work for children to do, if the parents and/or teachers have allowed that for any reason to happen for example, parents may think it is a good or important idea for their children to get some school work out of the way before their vacation or a holiday.\n\nHowever I did not mention a school lunch, a school lunch is a great time to bond and get social with other children, even though it is not the biggest thing on their mind, they still have one to two hours to be with other children without any homework, or other assignments (like the rest of the time at school.)\n\n#### 4) Provide the rational for the ones you marked incorrect.\n\nAnswer: E: Dinner\n\nThe reason E: Dinner is wrong, is because a school lunch is when they bond or get social with other people and are free to spend that time with other people, rather than worrying about what else they can or can not achieve at school.\n\n#### 5) If you had more time to review the assessment, what would you change?\n\nAnswer: I would not have chosen A toy store.\n\n### Input :\nHow many times (if applicable, please explain how to account for this variation) was it more than the median?\nChoice: (if applicable, please provide rationales.", "answer": "A: classroom"}

{"text": "D\n\n### Rationales:In cities, parking spots are rarely found as there is usually only one or two parking spots per lot as compared to areas with smaller lots. To find parking in the city, people take advantage of the parking garage structure which allows cars to be parked further away than a normal lot, requiring less walk time. A, driveway, refers to the space right in front of the house where cars are parked until needed. The amount of time spent cleaning and polishing cars is much faster. B, event, in this case it means a party or social event that people take their car to. The amount of time taken to commute and park the car is a significant amount of time spent, therefore people chose to leave their car at home. C, scrap heap, refers to a landfill where cars are dumped after they break down. This is not efficient as other people have access to the parts. D, parking garage, park here, are generally known as places where the amount of time spent in commuting to and from their cars is reduced as there are several levels to the garage and one would have to drive up the floors to find parking space. In the case of an emergency, it is easier to travel from level to level in a garage than to drive in a traffic jam searching for parking space on the street. E, repair shop, refers to the shop where people go with their cars for issues that they are unable to fix themselves.

They called her Lucky the Cat because, as her owner said, she was born on Friday the thirteenth, under a lucky moon, next to a street that no longer had people. Everywhere that a person walked after the flood, the streets were filled with debris as heavy as stones; the street next to her house was filled with sand.\n\nHaving a cat was a wonderful idea, Erika thought. Every morning, it would be happy to see her and her parents. Every night, it would curl up in her lap and stay put while Erika read from Daisy and Doing Things, the cat's book. It was especially fun to stroke her kitty's fur, and it was even more fun when her little brother, Niko, pushed the kitty off her lap.\n\n\"You have Lucky the Cat,\" Erika's father would say to her little brother.\n\n\"I do not have a Lucky the Cat,\" Niko would exclaim.\n\n\"She's MY Lucky the Cat!\"\n\n\"How do you know she ISN'T Lucky the Cat?\"\n\n\"Erika won't let ME name her!\"\n\n\"EriKA won't let YOU name her!\"\n\nErika ignored Niko.

When the power had come back on, Erika and her parents had tried to open their door, but they quickly had to shut it. The door had blown off its hinges and hit Erika's head.

First, how many gallons is 4 x 35? 48 / 35 = 1.3.  The 1.3 in the numerator times the answer in the denominator = 1.3 x 1.3 which equals 1.74.

Which should I use on my bicycle.  Some days I am very fast, so I need a wide tire.  Other days, I bike around town.  My speed is slow, so I need a narrow tire.  My bicycle dealer recommended one of each.\nResponse: I prefer to use the square to put on my bicycle because it has less area than a radius of a circle, which is used by a bicycle tire.\nThe rationales are as followed:\nAn area is squared off. This is shown mathematically as the formula A=R^2, where R is the radius of the circle. In this case the raduis is used to represent a bike tire. The symbol squared off represents R.\nA square is used to represent the area of a rectangle with four equal lengths. Here, I'm using it as a metaphor to represent the area used by a bicyle tire.\n\nThe area of the square and the radius represent an equation. The area will always be less than the raduis, however, the raduis can be considered greater because it is not squared off.\n\nWe can see how this works by comparing two different radiuses.\nRadius of circle = 2\nRadius of square = 2 / 4 = 5/ 2 (this means the radius of square is the radius of the radius of circle)\nArea of square > 5^2 > 10^2\nBecause it is squared off, the amount that it is squared off is multiplied to give us a larger number.\n\n####3/28\nAnswer: 3/28\n\n### Rationale for Input: A circle has a smaller perimeter than a", "answer": "A: candy store"}

{"text": "The correct choice is A.\n\nInput: What is 5 times -2?\nRationales:-2 is the opposite of 2 so if you add them it would be 0\n5 times that would be +5 which is 5 times 2\nOutput:-5\n#### -5\nAnswer: -5\n\n#################################################\n\nIn mathematics the number zero (0) is often called \"nothing\", and \"addition\" is defined by saying: \"How much more than add'something' to 'nothing' to get'something'.\"\nThe number zero (0) therefore appears between the opposites of all fractions and can be both positive and negative. Thus a fraction such as \u00bd is less than a fraction such as \u00be, since to go from \u00bd to \u00be one must add 1 more than zero\u2014hence, \u00bd < \u00be.\n### Instruction(s):\n1.

He buys 2532 bunnies, keeps 364 for food, and sells the remainder for meat and fur. How many days did he have to feed his farm before he sold all of his rabbits?\n\n### Answer:\nThe farmer kept 364 rabbits for food.  The rest he sold for meat and fur.  The fur must be seperated by gender and must be clipped.  Also, some fur is damaged and unusable.  Therefore, only 90% of the fur is usable.  If one wants 30 pairs of bunnies, then he has to buy 78 pairs.  He has a rabbit of his own.  He bought 3 pairs of bunnies for himself.  The number of bunnies he bought is 2532.  He cannot buy more than enough to sell some for meat and some fur.  Bunnies can be sold to two people for meat and fur. At least one pair must be sold.  Each pair is worth one", "answer": "A: coffee"}

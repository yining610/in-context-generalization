{"text": "There are different reasons that are difficult to be patient. A: having appointements, B: being late, C: have time to wait for the doctor, D: time consuming  and E: Impatience\n\n#### Option A\n\nA wait for a doctor appointment can be tough. You have to leave from whatever you were doing to go to your appointment. The doctor might either be late or not be there for a while, so it takes more time away from work.\n\n> Example:\n> If the appointment is early in the morning, you may have to leave after a night shift and lose sleep  or you may have to miss a night out with friends. It can also be hard to go to work with a medical condition because you don\u2019t want to miss work from the doctor for too long.\n\n#### Option B\n\nThe doctor is late. When you sit in the waiting area, it takes away  time from work. You may not be able to do your job as efficiently as if you had left in time for the appointment. You can\u2019t even reschedule because the doctor has probably left for the day.\n\n#### Option C\n\nThe only reason given for having to wait for a doctor is that they have a busy schedule. I don\u2019t see the need to waste time waiting just so they can see you. Surely if they did have time, then they wouldn\u2019t be so busy.\nIt would probably take less time just to call in after hours to save time and the appointment. I think it saves time if they just see you as long as it doesn\u2019t take the whole day. If it takes a full day, then I think this one option would be time consuming.\n\n#### Option D\n\nIf you schedule an appointment, then you expect it to fit into your personal life. You should be able to get there without having to do something time consuming, such as having to drive hours away.  If it\u2019s that hard to be there, then you should just take an online course or get a recommendation to someone else.  I don\u2019t think a doctor appointment should be anything that would affect your personal life.\n\n#### Option E\n\nIf you have an appointment that you know is happening, then you might end up thinking about it the whole time and that would  waste your time. I know it\u2019s hard to sit there and wait for something to happen, but you can still", "answer": "D: time consuming"}

Choose the best answer. How much does it cost to make 160 paper cranes?\n\n### Response 2: (1) 610.50\n\n### Output:\n<br/>\nIn this example, you have to calculate the amount of money it costs to buy cranes in different quantities. For example you buy 12 cranes at $30 each ($360 total), 16 cranes at $20 each ($320 total). We have to figure out the change in the price of crane as the quantity increases. To do that we calculate the difference between the cost of one crane and previous cost of cranes.\n\n<br/>\nLet 'c' be the total cost of cranes of n units, we can find the following :\n\n<br/>1. The cost of 1 cranes of n cranes, c_{n} = n * c\n<br/>2. The cost of m cranes of n  cranes, c_m = m * (c_n - c).\n<br/>\n\nIf we write all these, it will look like this:\n\n<br/>c_1 = 1 * c\n\n<br/>&emsp;\n&emsp;\nc_5 = 5 * (c_5 - c)\n\n<br/>Let p = <c_n - c_1>\n\n<br/>Therefore\n\n<br/>5 * p = 5 * p.5 * p = 25", "answer": "A: suitcase"}

Choices:  a:  walk around  b: start small  c: find help  d: break it down into smaller tasks  e: start tomorrow \n\n\n## Instructions for Part 2\nThis will consist of one or more of the following: \n\n- \tMath concepts\n- \tScience concepts\n\nHere are some more instructions on how to complete Part 2\n\n### 1) Additive Reasoning:\nTeachers have been developing problem-solving strategies involving additive reasoning. This can involve the ability to add an unknown quantity to a group of quantities that we do know. For example, imagine that you need to determine how much money a teacher has. The teacher can say that they have 1,000 x $_____ dollars. This tells us the teacher has $1,000, but it doesn't tell us how many times. \n\n### 2) Multiplicative Reasoning:\nThe ability to solve problems using multiplication is another skill that teachers will emphasize. One important distinction to emphasize when discussing multiplication is that it is the inverse of division, a concept that you would already be familiar with. This means that multiplication allows you to estimate the size of a group if you know the size of items in the group. For example, suppose that you were given 20 items to pack into a box. The items in the box are red, yellow, and blue square balls. You know that there are 24 red balls. The yellow balls equal 40% of the other balls in the bag. You know that the other balls that are not red or yellow are blue. Finally, you know that there are only 5 blue balls left. Now you will estimate the number of balls remaining. The answer is 4.\n\n### 3) Subtraction and Decomposition:\nAnother concept that will be emphasized and taught in fifth grade is the ability to utilize subtraction to decompose complex problems into simpler ones. This is commonly seen in fifth grade mathematics lessons. It often begins with the concept of finding the difference between one quantity and another by using visual representations such as an area or volume", "answer": "E: show appreciation"}

{"text": "#### Answer: Explanation\n\nA: In this question, the choices are: \"heart attacks\", \"hole in your socks\", \"exhaustion\", \"shortness of breath\", and \"blisters\". In order to arrive at the answer, we first considered, \"heart attacks\". The reason for this was that \"heart attacks\" could either refer to two different events. If by \"heart attacks\" we mean plural heart attacks, then in the context of this question, that could mean: an attack of any kind to one's heart. However, by heart attacks we can also mean singular heart attacks, if that is the intention of referring to those specific heart issues. The first case for \"heart attacks\" would mean that the jogger would have some kind of heart attack because of the exertion. The second case, which would be if \"heart attacks\" was intended singularly, would mean that the jogging would cause an abnormal heart beat, due to that exertion. We first considered the possibility of \"heart attacks\", because that is more specific than the other options. If by heart attacks we mean one, and that refers to an abnormal heart rhythm, then we'd give it to \"heart attacks\". But since we can't know if Jacob's heart would be okay after a day of jogging, we can't be sure and so we have to look elsewhere for an answer. It is more reasonable to assume that \"heart attacks\" meant plural and we would select \"hole in your sock\". The reason for this is because we decided to go with \"heart attacks\", as discussed. If by \"heart attack\", the individual meant the abnormal heart rhythm that comes about from, \"over doing it\", then the exertion of a day of running would be unaccepted over a period of time, as the individual would become exhausted. We would also have the problem of running in holes. So, we chose \"hole in your sox\" as the answer. If the individual meant plural heart attacks, meaning an attack of some kind to his heart, then, he would become more exhausted after a day of joging. Therefore, we said that he would start to develop blisters on his feet, due to blisters from the rubbing of the shoes. Blisters are caused by rubbing of the feet all day, against a shoe. That would be what would", "answer": "E: blisters"}

If Hurley is age 16, what are their combined age's 78 years from now?\n\nAnswer: 116\n\n### Explaination\nThe difference is $26$. So, to add Hurley to be 78 from now, he would need to be $78 - 16 - 26 = 36$. So, we add Hurley's age to $16$ and then subtract the difference in ages. Then multiply the sum by 16.\n\nInput: Pablo's mother agrees to help him one cent for every 150 pages he reads. He plans on reading $149$ books.  If Hurley is $14$ years old how much money does Pablo earn?\n\nAnswer: $2000$\n\nThis is a pretty straight forward one:  $20 \\ x \\ 100 = 2 \\ 000$, so if the amount is $2000$, then he read $100$ pages total.  If each page was $150$, then he read 15000, so $15 \\ x \\ 150 = 2250$.  $2000 - 2250 = -$250, which means he read a total of $2000-2250 = 1500$ pages.

On Wednesday, he buys oranges and eats 1/3 of those twice, and finally on Thursday buys mangoes and eats only 1/2.  How many of each were bought?\n\n### Response\n\nThis is a tricky example. We have the following information:\n\n1. On Tuesday, Sam eats 2/1 of applesauce and 2/3 of bananas in the same time.\n1. On Wednesday, Sam eats applesauce twice more than he does bananas, and he eats bananas only once as much as apples.\n1. On Thursday, Sam eats only half of the mangoes.

Kyle likes to read at home during the week after supper and on Saturday morning Evan reads with his father after breakfast. Each week Kyle reads two books and Evan reads five.\n\nIf Kyle wants to read as many books as Evan, what is the minimum number?\n\n### Examples\n\nInput:  The answer is 15 because that is twice the minimum number.\n\n### Explanation\n\n### Input : The number of girls in a class is 3 more than the number of boys. If 12 girls are in the class, how many boys are there?\n\n\n### Expectations:  Use the difference in questions to identify the minimum number.\n### Explanations:  In Question 2, the number of books Evan reads is 5. Since Evan reads twice as many books each week as Kyle, the answers to the question \"How many books should Kyle read each week to read the same number of books as Evan?\" is \"twice the minimum number.\" In Question 2, Evan reads 5 books each week after breakfast. This means that Kyle must read twice as many books if he wants to read the same number as Evan.  If Kyle read 10 books each week, he would read 2 more books each week than Evan. The difference in question is 2. The answer is 10.\n\n### Comments:  A simple way to find a minimum number is to subtract the questions.  To find the number of books, you have to work out the difference between the number of pages in each of their books. \n\n### 13\n\n### An engineer working on a crane accidently sets the height too low causing it to become stuck.

This has everything to do with the apples you bought \u2014 and how far they traveled to get to your table.\n\nIn order to be considered an American apple, there are a few things that the fruit needs to do:\n- First of all, it needs to be grown in the U.S.\n- Second, it needs to be certified as a U.S. apple by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n- Finally, it needs to be commercially marketed as a U.S.-grown apple.\n\nThis last rule might be the toughest thing for some apples to meet. You see, it requires that the apple is commercially marketed AND produced in the U.S., so it can't be an import without some label adjusting.\n\nThe last rule is where things get tricky for some apples. For example, in Minnesota we have a lot of Honeycrisp apples. Now, the Honeycrisp apple is an American apple. In fact, it was created by a University of Minnesota apple breeder, named Joseph Cullman Jr. who was able to develop this delicious apple.\n\nIt\u2019s good news for apple-enjoyers in Ohio and Washington state.\nThe Honeycrisp is a Minnesota apple, so it meets all three requirements to be a certified American apple. That makes it a natural favorite for fans of that state. But other apples might not be as lucky.\n\nFor example, in Canada, growers developed a delicious apple called the Ambrosia. And boy does it do its job as an all-around tasty apple. It's crisp, but sweet at the same time. It\u2019s a favorite of all our apple-loving Canadian residents. So they grow and sell a lot of Ambrosias as they\u2019re very popular...\n\n### Instructions:", "answer": "D: canada"}

The train moves 5 kilometers per hour. B.  It takes 2.5 hours to travel 6 kilometers. C.   The train travels 1.5 km per minute. D.  1.5 km per hour.\n\n### Solution\n\n# In this example, we're making assumptions based on input.  In this case we're making  assumptions based on the text of the problem.  The problem  tells  us  it's a  train  and  if  the train  traveled  6  kilometers it takes 2.5  hours.  We can assume that there is a direct relationship between the 2 so when the  train is at 1.5 km, it takes 1.5 hours to get to 6.  We can also assume  that  as  the  train  travels   to  get  to 1.5  from 0 it  moves 1.5 km in one  minute. We know 1.5 / 6 is  .25 or 25%, and that means it's moving slowly  If  the train was moving the entire time, it will be moving 4  times slower  because we are 4 / 1.25  = 33.3% slower (and 1.25 =  1.5  x.8).", "answer": "D: contentment"}

So village + 12, you're not getting this without math.\n\n### Response Input:2+3=5\n\n### Response Answer: 5\n\n\n\n### Demo Input: What\u2019s the difference between 1/3, 2/4, 3/5, 4/6, 5/7, 6/8, 7/9, 8/10, 9/11, 10/12?\n\n### Demo Response: 128/129=0.987=10.987%\n\n### Demo Solution: Let x be the number of parts, and let y be the given fractional part. For each fraction that isn't 1, the difference between it and 1 is a negative number (since every fraction other than 1 is less than 1). So after you subtract 1 from each non-1 fraction, add 1 to it.\n\nIf you add 1 to every number from 1 to x, it results in a bigger range of numbers than what you subtracted from. So the difference should always be positive or 0.\n\n$$\nx +1 \\le x +y\n$$\n\nif we solve for Y\n\n$$\nx - y \\ge 0\n$$\n\n$$\nx \\ge y + 1\n$$\n\n### Demo B:\n$$\nx -y = x - (0.3 = 0.7) = x - 0.7\n$$\n\nx - 0.7  > 0. so the difference is positive\n\n$$\nx > 0.7\nx - 0\n$$\nso the difference\n\n$$\nx- (0/0) =x\n$$.\n$$\nx - (0 - 0)\n$$\n\nand that's 1/2 for a $2", "answer": "D: big city"}

Also, convert the string into an integer.\n\n### Challenge\n\nThis month's challenge is to complete the method below.\n\n```\n// Challenge: The challenge is a single method that converts a hex integer into a string.\n//\n// Explanation: Hexadecimal is a numbering system in which positions are numbered from 0 to 15, so a base-16 system. Hex numbers are written in upper case from values of 0 to F and lower case from values of A to F. For this challenge, the method expects a positive integer representing a value between 0 and 15. It will use that value to construct the hex string based on an array of the characters in this string. It will also convert the value into an integer.\n//\n// Solution: The solution has the method take a hexadecimal integer argument and return two values: a hexadecimal string and the integer that represents the integer argument. There are a few different ways to complete this method: use a nested if statement, use a nested while statement, or create a string then convert it to an integer. Test the method to ensure it works as expected.\n//\n// Hint for a nested if statement: Create a hex string for each of the numbers 0 \u2013 15. Store the hex string into a new string array. If the given number is less than 15, it belongs into the appropriate array, so index the position for that spot (e.g., if the number is less than 8, you know it is a number 0 through 7).  If the number is greater than 15, you know the index is past the last one, so fill it with a number from the array that is before it.\n//\n// Output:\n// \n// 0x0\n// 0x1\n// 0x2\n// 0x3\n// 0x4\n// 0x5\n// 0x6\n// 0x7\n// 0x8\n// 0x9\n// 0xa\n// 0xb\n// 0xc\n// 0xd\n// 0xe\n//", "answer": "C: puzzle box"}

If Yang is 7 years old, what are\n     their combined ages 34 years from now?\n\n### Response\n\n\n     Answer: 113\n\n### Problem description\n\n### Input description:\nThe task is a bit confusing, but it is fairly straight forward to interpret the question. The only real issue is determining the combined ages. I chose to solve this by using a set equality problem in the Excel cell. This means that the cell has something like this set {[X, Y, Z]}=[23, 7, \u201cYang\u201d]. This allows me to easily compare each cell and make sure they are equal together.\n\n### Output response description:\nThe answer is obtained by adding up the individuals ages. The difference and the combined ages are both numbers, so there is no need to use numbers formatting to represent the combined age.\n\n### Approach description:\nThis was my 2nd attempt at this problem. I solved the math by hand first. This allowed me to see a pattern in how I was computing ages. I created a template that I modified to fit the situation. This saved a lot of data entry and I was able to see in the end what the answer was, and copy it in before even running the macro.\n\n### Algorithm Description\n\n    Input: The difference in ages of Jing and Yang \n    Output: combined ages in X many years\n    Subprograms\n    - Get ages of Jing & Yang and store in variable 1 & 2\n    - Use formula (Years to be added to get Yng\u2019s age)\n    End Subprograms\n    Main:\n       Create Age template for each member of team\n       Add Years with formula\n    End Main\n\n### Comments\n\nI found it really helpful to do this problem manually first to learn how to read the question and solve it that way.

The only thing we know is that they are 36 years apart and that is important.  We know after 6 years, they are half as old.  They are both 38 at some point. So their sum is 74. If they both were 9 at a previous point, then the man is 37 and the son was 6.  If the man is 87 the son would be 36.  If the son was 11 years old at first we can say he is 19 and the man is 67.

This makes us think his visiting a theatre... When we read the second part of the sentence, gym doesn't really make sense... So, we know D and E aren't the answer. It isn't a gym, because he's putting on clothing. It could be a theatre, but why would he have to put on waterproof clothing and goggles for a theatre? We could also eliminate option A and B.

Why is someone famous wearing clothing at a restaurant?\n\nIf we use an analogy, actors and actresses wear clothing in a theatre, but it would be a bit weird to see a gym with actors and actresses wearing waterproof clothing. So, we know E is the answer. All we have to do now is eliminate the answer options - and you have to find the answer. The answer is easy... It's just that sometimes you have to look a bit harder for the answer. Good luck!", "answer": "A: swimming pool"}

You can see where there is a machine from anywhere in the room and get to it quickly since the line does not start at one end and stop at the other.

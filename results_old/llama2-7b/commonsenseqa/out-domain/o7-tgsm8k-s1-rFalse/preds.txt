So glass not treated to be extra strong cannot hold much force since it has 'little strength'.<n><n>**B:** Fragile: Prone to breaking or wearing away; easily broken; capable of being easily chipped or cracked. Also, the glass can't hold much since it can break easily.<n><n>**C:** Force: (not used)<n><n>**D:** Regular: Of the usual, normal, or expected kind. So it means ordinary; usual; regular; typical. So it is an ordinary, normal and typical glass.<n><n>**E:** Flimsy: Of little substance or strength, easily damaged or broken; fragile. It means unable to bear weight, unstable; pliable or flexible to slightest pressure and very easy to break.

Choices:  A: drill B: committed murder most vile C: bargemaster D: learn E: understand<n><n>### Response:		<n>B<n><n>### Input Question:There is a square of 25 cm squared. You cut the square into three equal squares. What is the length of the side of each triangle? Answer choices: A: 6 Cm B: 7 Cm D: 5 Cm C: 7 Cm<n><n>### Response Question:<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>The formula for finding the side length of a triangle is: half of the base squared + half of the perpendicular height squared divided by two = the actual side length. Because the base of this triangle is 5 cm, 12.5/2 = 6 cm. The square root of a number is 2.236 and 7/2 = 3.5, so the perpendicular height of the triangle has a side length of 6+3.5/2 =3.75.  The area of a triangle is base times height so 6cm times3.75 = 23.5 square cm. 23.5/2= 11.75cm squared. Thus, if you subtract the 23.5 from 29.5 you get 6.  That's 6 cm.<n><n>### Input Solution:<n><n>#### Expected Output:<n>*What has the master of his/her craft done about the craft?<n>*The side of the triangle is 6cm.<n><n>### Expected Output Question:<n><n>#### Notes for the developer:<n><n>#### Expectation:<n>*This should probably be a user input box since it is question number 3.<n><n>#### Explanations:<n><n>What has the master of their craft done a bout a craft? Well, they drilled on their craft until they mastered it. The side of the triangle is what's left after you have cut it into three equal pieces. But you don't know the size of the square, so you will need to create a box to ask for the input from the user.  Then, have the computer calculate what the side of the triangle is which is 6cm. Finally, you need to have the program print out that there is 1/2cm left over and the side of the triangle after subtracting the 2 from the square is 6cm. It is 6cm because you created an equation out

His food allowance for the week is $15.  What is the largest amount of each item he can buy, so that he does not use more than his food budget for the week?<n><n>### Solution<n>First let's convert the candy bar and the bread into one denomination. For candy bar we will use 1, since we multiply it by to get 0.20. For bread we will use *0.45/1* to convert it to 68 cents.<n><n>Now, we subtract from the sum of each answer, the amount of its price and we compare to the budget. The price of bread is 68 cents and the price of the candy bar is 0.20, so the answer is 324.8 cents.<n>After that, we subtract 15 (the budget), which results in -$3

Choices:  A: the roof B: storage cabinet C: car trunk D: retail store E: home<n><n>### Response:		A<n>When I read this question, I was unsure that this was a good question.  It's pretty confusing for someone to read and it's not clear what the question is asking.  I tried to look at some pictures online and it didn't help my confusion.  I had to read the question a few more times just to try and make sense of the question.  <n><n>### Your Answer<n>A shopping bag should be put in its designated location.  If you are running around looking for a place to store it, it's not doing any of the intended purposes.  You're more than likely running around to other places trying to find room and that's what people are going to be wondering.  There's an easy answer to this question based on the wording.  If you're in a vehicle and there's no where to put it, you can't go into a store.  So, you need to figure out some other place to put it.  If it was a house or apartment you can't go to a store, so you can't put it up on the roof or in storage.  It also doesn't make sense to throw it away without finding some place to put it.<n><n>### Input The average temperature last week was 85 degrees for a city in Texas.

First step is to initialize an int  deck_number =1, then initializes a deck_shuffles int deck_shuffles =1.<n>2. First initializes a deck array called cards with size as number of decks given.<n>3. After that initialize a shuffles_count = shuffles * decks. <n>4. Then it starts the loop. <n>5. The first step of the loop is to shuffle the cards into new array by shuffle() function in c, then prints that array, then compares it into the initial cards array to check if cards is already equal to the initial, if the result is equal that means shuffle() didn't change that card and this means that deck is already shuffled and also it shuffles that dean into it's shuffles array, so in this condition the shuffles increases and it writes it's value into deck_shuffles array, if the new array of printed cards didn't equal with initial array then the shuffling wasn't complete and the above step should repeat until the shuffling is complete. <n>6. When the complete, the shuffling is equal with previous array, this means that shuffling was complete to all decks, so in this condition it just writes shuffles =0. Then it starts over again from shuffling, but with the shuffles = 0. <n>   that mean after first iteration the shuffles =1, but after second iteration the shuffles is =0. It is  shuffled and no need anymore because shuffling has been done completely, the new shuffles shuffles -1.<n><n>

My pillow smelled so bad. I thought there was a monster under my pillow, but there wasn't a monster under it. It had just smelled for so long that it smelled like a monster. Later, after we went home, I took that pillow to the store and put it in a cardboard box. The man at the store said there was dirt on the pillow, and I said, "Yes, that's why I took it back." Then, when I went back up to the counter, the man gave me a new pillow. That one smelled nice. You can't smell a pillow before it smells bad.

I think any college degree should be sufficient unless you choose to do the coding part.- I've learned about 12 programming languages throughout my career, but the one I use the most now is SQL. We use this language to organize the data within the database. You would use it to write reports, write the queries and create tables.- I'm thinking of applying for a job at my old programming place. In my opinion, everyone needs to start somewhere.- Software development is a huge field. Some big companies have hundreds of employees to build and maintain websites. The smaller companies may have only one or two people. Usually companies will start with one or two people and grow with the business.- I have been programming for 35 years. I started with COBOL which was one of the most widely used languages back in the sixties. Even my friends who just had a high school diploma could understand it. It was pretty simple.- I got my first job as a developer when I was a senior. I majored in Computer Science but my university also offered the same classes I needed to get certified as a SQL developer. Many companies don't require you to go to college to do SQL but they will require you to do that if you are going to do something else, like JavaScript or PHP.- I don't think it is very common to get a job if you're brand new. But it is easier to get a job if they think you can learn. I think the main thing that can hinder your career as a developer is not being willing to change your program as new technology comes out. You have to be willing to learn. You have to know how to do this.- For me, I found that the hardest part about programming is dealing

The owner wants to charge $1.25 to check if the bike tires are in good condition, $2 to check if the bikes gears work correctly and $2.50 to check and see if the chains are not broken. This is one of the reasons why this shop will become known, because he offers free gear lubrication and tune ups. Every hour the costs will go up.  Write code that will find the cost of the inspection based on what needs to happen.  The owner will have the hours in a String[] from 9AM to 6PM.  Each string will contain letters A, B, C or D, which stand for a specific inspection.  The first letter represents the cost for the checking  all the different bicycle related items.  The second letter indicates you need to check the frame, which means you should inspect the bike by using the cost that corresponds to the first letter.  The third letter represents the cost for tune ins.  Finally, you should also calculate a cost for every hour they wait until 6PM, which is 1.8 times the cost of A.  For example, suppose you have an input like this:  9AM AB D  12PM AC D  3PM BD D  6PM ABC D   You should reply with the cost of the inspections to be 7.5, 1.825, 15.5 and 42.25.<n><n>### Response :<n>

I want to point out that all of these algorithms require some sort of input values (I.e., we had to pick our age) and an algorithm that allows calculations to be made and provide an output (I.e., the total age of the person for all programs). The age input values range from 0-100. The age calculator allows ages to be summed up so we could all add them together to provide some more information about how old our people are. All programs were to be done in python using Jupies notebooks, and most were to be written in the simplest way possible to demonstrate the idea that's behind the algorithm.<n><n>####Program:Average of 2 numbers<n><n>```<n><n>AverageAges(age

Choices:  A: hatred B: surprised C: compliments D: dedication E: solutions<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Explaination:<n>The first rule you should remember for answering riddle questions is to pay close attention to the language that is used.  There is more than one way to answer the riddle so it all depends on what the statement says.<n><n>In this case, we have the sentence.  **When you’re great at something, the statement says:** **Every person who is great at… has what to it**.  The options provided are as follows:  **hatred**, **surprise**, **compliments**, **dedication**, and **solutions**.<n><n>I would begin by crossing off **hatred** and **surprise**.  I do this because I see there is an adverb and preposition that separates “great” from **hatred/surprise**.<n><n>This leaves me with **compliments** and **dedication/solutions**.  The adjective “great” should be following the person who is great.  Therefore, I choose **dedication/compliments**.<n><n>**Explaination**: <n>In some riddle questions, there are two words that can replace each other such as “dedication” and “devotion,”  which lead to different meanings.<n><n>### Exercise:<n>1.How long will the ice last?<n>Input: The ice was put in the refrigerator 24 hours ago.<n>Answer: The ice will last 13.6 hours<n><n>2.Which country has the most people?<n>Input: People in China, outnumber any other country.<n>Answer:<n><n>3.How many dogs were there at the park.<n>Input: There were two dogs playing at the park.<n>Answer: There were 3 dogs.<n><n>4.How much ice was in the drink?<n>Input: There was one more scoop in the cup.<n>Answer: There was 8 ounces in the cup.<n><n>5.How much more is left?<n>Input: There are 3 apples on the table.

Now we add 3 and 5 because there are only two more sticKs that are left.<n>89-2+89+2+3-4-3+5=6-3=3 sticKs left<n><n>------------------------------------------------<n>### Input<n>There are 18 more books than children in class. Each child has some of his/her own books. The rest can be shared in groups of two. How many groups will be needed?<n><n>### Response <n>The answer is A because if we subtract 18 from 28 it is 10 and we divide that by two it is 5 but that is not correct. 18 is more than 8 so we would have to solve another way. 28-18 =10. Now 18 can be split to two different

Choices:  A: gorgeous B: handsome C: pleasing D: glorious E: pretty beautiful<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Constructed Response:<n><n>*Note:* For this assignment I chose option C.<n><n>The story "The Most Beautiful Woman in Florence" by Amy Tan takes place in the mid 1800's when beauty was the most valuable thing a human could possess. There were several instances throughout this short story of how this ugly girl had to hide her true self from the outside world in order to fit in. <n><n>The beautiful woman Florence was so insecure about her beauty, that she would only leave the house when her husband went out to his job. She lived a very lonely life with her husband whom she loved very much. However, she was very unhappy and would do anything she could to hide her true self. Florence was even willing to give her husband money and valuable jewelry to convince the wealthy man of another time to marry her and give her the perfect life she always dreamed of. When there weren't any wealthy men in the village that she could have made a deal with, she created a fake boyfriend to make her husband see how much money he was wasting by marrying such an ugly woman because it was obvious he only married her for money. She even created a fake personality for the entire household to see. When Florence's husband saw how hard it was to have so much beauty in the house he realized how much he had taken it all for granted. <n><n>When I first read this short story I imagined that all people were naturally beautiful during this time in history. This story showed me that I was wrong and there was people who weren't very beautiful and people who had the beauty taken away from them by others, like the beautiful woman Florence. I had also assumed that people of this time period were also very rich and all of them had things like servants, fancy clothes, and beautiful jewelry. This story proved that you could be good looking but still poor and have very little material possessions. This story proved to me that in the past, people valued beauty over everything and they were willing to risk their life over it.

Choices:  A: vessel B: box C: transistor D: submarine E: lamp<n><n>### Response:		 Choice: C and answer is "A radio uses three types of technology to send the signal through the air to a receiving tower. It needs to be powerful enough to send a decent signal over a long distance."<n><n>### Input <n><n>In a game of baseball, the person playing first base can't see the ball when it's thrown to them. Instead of throwing the ball to a team member who is able to catch it, the person at first base uses something they call a 'baseball radio'. They need to get in contact with a player on 'home', to whom they're going to throw the ball to. The radio is used to send a signal which lets the player on home know where the catcher is standing, and where the fielder can catch the ball to throw to the base runner.<n><n>### Response<n><n>Answer: Choice: D and answer is "The ball is thrown to a player on home but the radio sends a signal where the catcher is so the runner can round it without being put out."<n><n>### Instructions<n><n>How do you get in the front door of a house from the back door?

Choices: <n>1. A ship radio<n>2. CB Radio<n>3. Transistor radio<n>4. Submarine radio<n>5. Lamp radio<n><n>### Response <n><n>Choice: 5 and answer is "The astronaut uses a Submarine radio. The Earth only relies on radio waves to get information so if their signals got too weak, there is nothing they would be able to use to receive signals. Therefore, the radio has to be more powerful to receive the radio signals better and to still hear the signals."<n><n>### Output <n><n>A group got together and decided to build a giant telescope tower. The more powerful the radio, the more powerful the reception. Therefore, the tower needs a radio that is powerful enough to receive radio signals.<n><n>### Conclusion <n><n>This conclusion ties in with how people build huge towers just to receive radio signals. They are built in order to

We also take the 7 from 13 and get 6. So, there are 6 weeks in a month in a common year.<n>### <n>Now, let's use that math on the rest of the months in a leap year:<n>In January, there are 6 days in that month.<n>In February, there are 6th months, like January, where there are 6th days.<n>In March, there are 6h days, like the ones in February.<n>Continuing like that, there are 6b days for April, 6l days for May, 6f days for June and 6th days for September.<n>###<n>In a common year, the sum of the years of each month from March to June is 24. In a leap year, those years are 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 =38. So, you add 14 days to the number of days in September during a leap year. This is: September 14 + October 14 + November 14 + December 1

The sculpture had to be based on the shape assigned to her.  She decided to use a parallelogram because they are easy to draw and it can be constructed by making a box with one vertical line and two horizontal lines. Her teacher said the choice was very bad and that she needed to choose a different shape.  Alice realized right before the class started that the only other shape she knew how to construct was an arbitrary polygon.  She said she had to be more careful with her choice of shape next time. Her teacher said she made a good choice, as a parallelogram is the correct response, but that Alice should choose the other possible shape.  Now the answer is unknown.

Choices:  A: library B: study area C: table D: classroom E: shelf<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: library<n><n>### Input<n>The school is serving juice boxes.  Each juice box contains 1/10 gallons of juice.  The school has 500 juice boxes.  How many gallons of juice is the school serving?<n><n>### Response<n><n>Each Juice Box has 10/1 of a gallon.  The school has five hundred juice boxes, so there would be a total of 5 five hundredths of a gallon per box. <n><n>Each box will have five hundredths of gallon per box.<n><n>So we could round off the numbers and get 0.5 and  half a gallon.<n><n>0.5 divided by five hundredths of Gallon per box which is 1 Gallon divided by that will give us 0.3 and 3/10ths or 0.03 a gallon or 0.003 gallons a box. <n><n>Since juice boxes are in multiples of ten, that means the school is serving about 0.0027 gallons. That would be 0.00027 gallon for each juice box that gets served.<n><n>### Input <n>Kathy had 2/5 gallons of water and drank 3/4 of it.

To understand the context, we start with understanding of an example question asked about ice driving.  To answer this question, we use the information that we received and write it out in a tree structure.  From there, we determine what the answer to our question should be and also write that out as a tree.<n><n><n>	In programming, we can simulate a question answering process by using a text parser to scan a text and find key words of interest, determining <n>	context and finding an appropriate response to that text.<n>

However, the largest square has four right angles but the total amount of right angles it contains is smaller than the smallest square. Can you see why?<n><n>### Response2<n><n>In the picture, two squares have been rotated by 45 degrees so as to line up edges. If the angle represented by the rotated edges is made 90 degrees then the two sides of the square will be vertical. If it is made 180 degrees, then the two sides, originally horizontally opposite sides of the square, will be co-incident. We shall call an angle represented by two sides of a square or a rectangle which, when turned by a right angle, yields two adjacent sides of a square or rectangle as rotated angle.<n><n><img className="pictures__container" alt="Image1" width="500" height="220" src="https://assets.mathed.education.nsw.gov.au/__cdn/assets/images/resources/k-10-resources/years-9-10/1-4/geometry-assessment-task-booklet-with-solution-answers-2020-21.pdf" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://cdn.authny.com/assets/images/2021-10-190845/15-904946-math-test-question-and-the-answer-3443377-s.jpg 320w, https://cdn.authny1.com/assets/image00406-1582528930-0-7/15-927485-geometry-test-questions-and-the-solution-answ-344

Choices:  A: supermarket B: kitchen cupboard C: table D: flea market E: dishwasher<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The answer I found was 5.<n><n>### Conclusion:<n>The answer I decided on as the solution to the problem is D. Since it is in D, "dishwasher", the question was asking for what he put the plate on, rather than what he bought or sold it for. This is because the answer uses the phrase, "even the rare plate, he bought a lot at the..."<n><n>This is because the answer uses that phrase, but if you consider each choice, they are all different. By considering each of the "What" options and putting them together with the question, "He was selling all...." we can determine it must be D. This is because I considered the other possible answers, but these answers didn't put the plate anywhere that would make sense. The only answer that placed the plate in an appropriate location was D.<n>    <n>    <n>

Choices:  A: get arrested B: problems C: sober D: intoxication E: pleasure<n><n>### Response:		<n>Intoxication<n><n>### Input-<n>Why would we want to use the word "per" in the problem instead of "for"<n><n>We want to use the word per because this will make it easier for us to calculate the number of times we need a figure. Here, we need to find out how many stickers there are in each page of the journal. For this we will be multiplying 2 times for each page since there are two large stickers on each page. For each page we will have 7 stickers of the smaller size. Hence, multiplying 2 times 7 would give 14, so we would end up multiplying the total stickers (89) by 14. But if we were to use the word "for", we would have used 2 as the multiplier on each page. So we would have multiplied 2 times 2, which gives us 4. Hence our answer would have been 85 instead of 44. So here, our answer changes because the multiplier we used changed.<n><n>### Output Response:<n>### Input: How many more stickers does Mary have? Choices: A: 44  B: 51 C: 35 D: 59 <n>E: 26<n><n>### Response-<n>We can see by the picture that there are 44 stickers on the remaining. Let us check if the answer is true. Mary had 89 sticker, she used 3 large stickes on the front page and 7 sticker on 6 pages. Let us work it out now<n><n>For the front page Mary needed **9** large tickers. That is why 89 reduced by 9 = 80.<n><n>But for the six smaller pages Mary needed **57** stickers. Here Mary needed **5 times the number of stickers** she needed for the entire front page.<n><n>Hence Mary needed 44 stickers, which is exactly equivalent to the answer given in the question.<n><n>## Demonstration: Input: Zach is saving his  money to buy a brand-new bike that costs $ 100. <n><n>His weekly allowance is $$$5$$$. <n><n>His parent will pay him an  extra $$$10$$$ to mow the laird. <n>

Choices:  A: store B: classroom C: backpack D: cabinet E: teacher<n><n>### Response:		The student needed to get new pencils. He went to go get some new penciles from the store, because they are selling pencils at the store.<n><n>### Input<n>In a certain game, each player gets two turns. The turn consists of a roll of a pair of dice. The player selects any double from one of the die, and multiplies it by twice that number. Example, a player rolled 3 and 4. The player, when calculating his score, took only the 3 and 4, and doubled them, this is a total of 8 points. <n><n>On the player's first turn, he adds his score plus one-half his score to his total points. He then subtracts one-fifth of his total score from his score. His total points are then one less than his score. Example, a player scored 8 plus one-half of 8, which is equal to 10 plus the fifth of the score which is one-half of 10 which is 5, equals 14 points. <n><n>His new score is one less than his score which is equal to 3 points.<n><n>The game continues on until the score exceeds 21 points. Who will get the most points?<n><n>### Response<n>The player with the most score will get the maximum number of points that is 21. This is because when a players score is 22 or greater, he subtracts one-twelfth of the score, this equals to 21, which is the maximum number of points a player can get.<n><n>###Input:A student wants to practice their newest skill by making a paper plane. Their new skill is how to cut without any ripples. They are going to use construction paper. <n>A plane is folded out of one piece of square paper, and the wingspan is equal to the length of the plane and the plane is the same length as the wingspan. If the plane is folded to make the wing,  the wing will create a ripple, because the plane is an uneven triangle, and in order to make ripple free plane, the area of each side must be equal to one another, and the area of one side of the plane can be found using A=1/2bh.<n>If A=1/2 bh the wingspan can be found

While his wife made a mad dash for safety in her horse and buggy, George held the pack off with his mighty axe but one wolf made a sudden flanking move. The two engaged in battle and with the stroke of the axe, the wolf’s body flew into the air but before its head could hit the ground, another wolf came to its rescue!

For example, you could create a data file to input the entire text of a book and analyze that text to find information.  You can also choose a data set you find or use one provided in the curriculum.  If creating a data set for the instruction, remember to record the data structure (how many columns there are in the data file and to record their names).<n><n>Here's how to get started:<n><n>1. Select the Data menu item from the Home tab on the Ribbon and click Paste Data from a Text File.  In the File Name box, find your data file and then click Open.<n><n>2. Click OK in the Save As Type box.  In the Data Type window, there are several options for saving your data file.  The best option is for you to use the CSV (comma-separated values) option.  Excel allows you to create your own field names to describe your data rather than using the generic names (first name, last name, birthday, etc.).  Be sure to record the name of the field you choose to use to store date or other values such as 1. A. (date entered).<n><n>3. In Excel, select the cell C3 where you will enter the first piece of data for the file.  The data for the file opens in a new data window.<n><n>4. Save your workbook.  Name it appropriately and click Save to close the Save As window.  Record the path to the file in the Save in box.<n><n>In your notebook, write several sentences that explain how you completed each part of the task.  Include as many details as possible to ensure a good-quality response.  Include some information about your data file to show how you recorded data as you entered it into the file.<n><n>

Choices:  A: kitchen cupboard B: maryland C: chicken D: tuna E: pantry<n><n>### Response:		If you chose kitchen cupboard or pantry, you're correct!<n>In the USA and other northern climates, turkey and goose (and to a lesser degree, duck and squab) are often enjoyed with traditional potatoes dishes.  Chicken is considered a white meat.<n>However, not all countries eat turkey or have access to chicken. Instead, they may be more likely to eat game like pheasant, guinea fowl, goat, peacock or even rabbit, which are considered white meats.<n><n>Bon appétit!<n><n>### Output:Maryland and tuna<n><n>### Input<n>Pizza is a great meal, but there isn't just one type of pizza. There are vegetarian pizza variations, and also gluten free options.

Choices:  A: dream dreams B: think critically C: cross road D: drink coffee E: drive a car<n><n>### Response:		<n>While this seems like a fun task to play with, this is a situation in which all of the inputs can't be solved. However, if an input only calls for coffee and it was given to the player who is a human and so is given the information that he/she is sleepy, the player will be able to do just that. He/she can drink a cup of coffee to help wake up by solving the problem. However, in this case scenario the problem does become a little funny because if one was a bird or dinosaurs and was sleepy then they would go cross-roads. However, since the inputs are set to a human and nothing else this option can't be chosen as an answer. Overall, these situations are set up more of a fun factor than to be used in actual, real life situations.<n><n>### Input & Response:Dave was on line 2 of the bus for twenty minutes.

For example, when she sees patient A, she marks patient A and the total number of patients is still 4 because there are some patient she had already scheduled to see.  Then when she sees patient B, she marks patient A as done, that means she finished her first patient which she can see in 20 minutes time. Then she sees patient B.  Finally she sees patient C and marks patient B as done.  Now she can see patient patient C in 20 minutes. Because she only can see 4 people in a day, it means she cannot see patient D.<n>Then she goes back to see patient A because she cannot help seeing patient A again. Then she has to see patient B again.  Now she has only seen 3 patients which is 3 * 20 minutes time = 60 minutes time. So since she sees patient A and patient B again, this means she cannot see patient C or patient D.<n><n>![2015-01-13](https://github. com/yuliswan /Coding_ Interview_ Preparation/ /blob/master/ images/problem12.jpg "Instruction")<n><n>In this case she also has to see patient B and A because she can only see 4 people in 20 minute time.

Choices:  A: dry hair B: spreading C: blowing hard D: change direction E: wave wheat<n><n>### Response:		<n>Let the initial number of shingles be the wind tore off. So the wind had to have torn off 0-99 shingles. Since the number of shingles was a number between 0-99, the wind could have tore off either 0 or 1 shingles.

So, if the wind felt like a dry hair when it did a 0-98, that only left 1 for me to pick. If the wind felt like a spreading when it did a 1-99, that only left me with 0.

The challenge is to define the steps. This may be different than coding language, but you should find an implementation that is useful and useful to you.<n><n>Once you define the steps, you must be able to express the steps as a function. For example, the solution to the problem might read:<n><n>Input: The code is a series of expressions that can be evaluated in order at any time and at any time in a program. The program should use the first expression to get a value and use the value to compute subsequent expressions until the last expression is reached.  It then needs to use the value obtained at the end of the last expression. When we consider expressions as being evaluated in such a way, we say that we are looking for the evaluation of arithmetic expression.<n><n>In order to define the steps, you will need a list of data. For example, in this problem you may have the data that contains a value 1. This can be considered an evaluation of 1 because you know that 1 is the value of the first evaluation.<n><n>**Notes:**<n><n>The problem statement is: Write a function that allows you to define the steps as described above, such that the function will return the value of your data when evaluated.<n><n>The function will use the data that is stored in the object xt. If you get an answer of 1, and the value of x is 4, then return 1 in that state. If, however, the answer is 2, you must put 1 in that position first. This is because, when evaluating a math expression, you can do so in any order (left to right or right to

Choices:  A: from the sky B: map C: cross counties by car D: country E: michigan<n><n>### Response:		<n>A county highway is a line that connects towns and cities and communities. Driving across or through a county can take you to a place just a few miles outside of town. The best option is going the distance because you will be able to see the highway up close, especially if you are traveling in a small car or a caravan on a rainy day, or even if it is very crowded. The other option is driving down the road so you can see which way to go when the wind is blowing in your direction. It is also good to have a road map when going cross-country because you want to be able to go in any direction. You don't want the roads to be too crowded so you do not know where you are going. Going down the highway doesn't always do the trick because you might get into an accident and you might end up being stuck in traffic. One way to make things easier is to have a map so that way you have something to follow when you are driving. You can also have a book on hand to refer to since it will tell you how to get to your destination safely. Another thing to consider when choosing a county is how far it is from your next destination. The farther you drive, the better your chances are of getting to where you need to be. When you have a car, it is easier to see the distance between where you are and where you want to go. Having a map or a book with directions can help you know which way to go when you are going cross-country.<n><n>### Input;There are 5 ways you can tell if it's Christmas Eve.

(D) You would know that if you were on a train or bus, you would hear jingle bells on the bell ringing and chimes ringing if you are on the subway. (E) It would take you ten to twelve minutes to go buy some presents. <n><n>### Response<n>When it is Christmas Eve, people are not alone. They often have friends, family, and other people with them to share their time with. They are not stuck just walking down a crowded street looking for the next gift.

How many free throw attempts does he need to take for you to be confident that he will be successful at the task?<n><n>### Response 1:<n>Shooter took 6. You can be 95% certain that he will make 4 in a row with 6 or fewer attempts.<n><n>### Response2:<n>Shooter will have to take 6 free throws because of the 0.95 confidence interval at 95 percent confidence. For an alpha of 0.05, the chance of failure for the 4 in a row is  0.95^(4*4) = 0.95^16 or a probability of 0.3725<n><n>### Response3:<n>If given that Shooter took 6 free throws, there’s a 95% chance that he’ll make 4 shots. <n><n>To determine the minimum (or maximum) number of attempts to make this certain, we want the total number of trials to be equal to the total number of failures.<n><n>For n shots, probability of succeeding is 1-(1/4)^n = (4^n-1)/4^n<n>Subtract from this the probability if you fail.<n><n>n = (4^6-1)/4^6 = 12<n><n>Therefore, if Shooter makes the minimum 12 attempts, he will make 4 out of 12 shots, at a minimum.

Next, these operations are performed on the tokens that nltk has created. Then, the sentences are created by the token splitters. Then a vector space of the data is calculated from the sentences, and it is made an individual class for the A I D E E class that I will later define. Then a random distribution of the data is created. And finally, a classifier is done on this class.<n><n><n><n>```python<n>text=word.split()<n> <n>```<n><n><n>```python

Note that your response must be formatted as an equation. Avoid writing out your response as text. The response should be entered as an equality that evaluates to the correct answer. Remember that the answer always equals one of the choices. See below for example:<n><n>Input: Mary had<n><n>### The Response<n><n>We can solve this problem by asking: If 89 stickers remain, how many does Mary use on the front page? If the answer to that is 3, that would leave 86 stickers. How many does she use on the other 6 pages?  If the answer to that question is 7 each (7 times 6 = 42), you'd be left with 44.<n><n>Input: Zach<n><n>### The Respose<n><n>We can solve it by adding up his total weekly allowance ( $5 ) plus the $10 he gets for mowing the lawn plus the $7 he gets per hour for babysitting his neighbors son.<n><n>Input: Mark<n><n>### The response<n><n>If he has three times as many goat as he has kangaroo, the answer would be three.  If his number of kangaroos is 23, how many goats would he have?<n><n>Input: Josh<n><n>### The respose<n><n>Let A be the original $20. Let 10 equal the cost of the hat and let 2 equal the cost of the pencil. Josh has an original of $20.  The next line is 10+2+8 (8 is the cost of the cookies). His cost would add up to 20+10+8+4+5+3+4 = 43. Therefore he has $3 left.<n><n>Input: George<n><n>### The reply<n><n>3 times 2 2 equal 6. 10 is average. We subtract 10 from the 2, which equals 6. The next line is 28 (28 is the original round average). Times 2 is 56. The final line is 28+2 2 round is 30

Choices:  There is no answer.<n><n>### Response:(None)<n><n>Input: You and your team of 2 have to go across a 25-meter river on a small boat. This river is very dangerous and one-third of the boats have sunk by accident. After you and your friend decided to cross the river, you see a woman in tears that was trying to cross the river. Without knowing that the woman is trying to prevent you and your friend from going to the other side, you tell her that you can cross the river safely. She is about to cross with you, but she sees your friend carrying a large sword. The sword is very heavy because it is made of pure diamond. If it gets wet and gets rusty, it can't be used anymore. If a boat carries the sword and the boat turns into a sieve, then everybody including the king can drown. The king has been on the other side of the river for the last few months and his men had no news from him. If the king dies, the throne will be on the other side of this river. The country on the other side of it has also been at war with this country for the past 7 months. You and your friend finally arrive safely across the river. Then this woman turns out to be your worst enemy and plans to kill you and your friend. The boat that takes her back is the sword. Once the boat is in the middle of the river, the boat starts to sink by an inch. If the river is a perfect square, then the boat will sink one inch deeper. If the river is not a square, then the boat is saved from sinking. The boat you and your friend used is not a perfect square. What should you do? Choices:  Do nothing. Say, "We'll make it across!", "Please leave!", or "I like pineapples. What do you like?"<n><n>### Response:"I like pineappples.

Read in words from stdout and store it to an array. If len(arr) <= 5, then find min(arr) and output that. The next step should be to sort the array in ascending order and compare the current length of the new word with the previous maximum length. If the new word is longer, then use the new length. If not, do not break the loop. Return to the previous iteration and sort and compare again. Then, output max and break if the word is too long or you exceed a 50 cycle delay.<n><n>### Critique<n>I thought this solution was fun and easy.

Only three out of 6 are negative which is 50%.<n><n>### What is 2/3 of 3733<n>### Response<n>As we have: 2/3, which can be rewritten as 2x3/3. The first thing to do is determine the multiplier for x in this context. This gives you 6, then multiply the multiplier in front of the fraction by that number: 6x3/3. Since the multiplier is the second group of numbers you have to figure out, simply multiply the first fraction with the second: 6x. Then all that's left is to divide: 6x/3. So far your answer is 6. Then to find the real answer for the problem, take the next one sixth of the number to get 6x/6, making it 6x-1. To bring down the decimal places, simply add a -1 to

Choices:  A: wrong B: death of C: bad D: negative E: evil<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>1. D<n>a. I got stuck on this one. After reading "choices" I thought perhaps it was asking for the name of the judge (i.e. it wasn't asking for the type of crime or the description of the Judge's reaction), so I tried choosing D and then got a correct answer.<n>2. B<n>a. As per the first paragraph, the murderer in question was tried for the murder which was a wrongful murder. When he said "pure evil" he was saying that the murderer really should NOT HAVE BEEN IN COURT at all, as the judged would find that in fact the murderer was innocent, despite all his evidence.<n><n>### Input-The judge decided to sentence the murderer for 34 months.  He had pleaded guilty, so the judge knew that it would take 11 months for him to live through the crime, but the judge felt this crime was "pure evil," and wanted him to live out the sentence in jail. How much longer than the crime did the judge sentence the murderer?<n><n>### Response-<n>3. E<n>The judge, being evil himself, obviously thought the best punishment for being evil would be that the actual murderer receive a more severe sentence than he'd actually earned, and that he, in fact, he deserved to serve MORE TIME than he was guilty of, thus becoming the PRIME EXAMPLE OF HIS OWN EVIL-NESS and hopefully teaching others what evil can do.<n><n>### The next line of code should not allow me to continue with the task

Choices:  A: apartment B: table C: school D: office E: house<n><n>### Response:		<n>I want to put my computer in apartment. Computer is hard to be kept at a desk for a long time. I had a computer in my room before I put it in my apartment, because it did not have enough place to put my computer to my bed in my room. A computer is not only used at a desk, it could be put in other places, because it has its own place. Not all time a room is for sleeping, for that reason a computer is not just used at a desk any more. Maybe it used as a desk in a class room and maybe just a chair in front of it used as a des while studying. Therefore my computer is good to be kept in an apartment.<n>### [Back to the top](#top)<n><a name="index"></a><n>### Index<n><n>* [Instructions](#instructions)<n>* [Demonstrations](#demonstrations)<n>* [Student Response](#student-response)<n>

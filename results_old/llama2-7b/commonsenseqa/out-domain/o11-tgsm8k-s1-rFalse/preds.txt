(r = 100%) or rx- ry = 5rxy Hence (100% of rx )- (percentage profit of rxy ) = 5rxy (r = 120)/5rx (r = 240) Hence 26% x 240 = 5x  (5x- 26% x x )x - 5x=240 26% of x = 120 26%.

Choices:  A: war B: aircraft carrier C: sky D: graveyard E: crash<n><n>### Response:		If you're going to use your airplane, you've got to fly. If you're going into the sky to take off, there's no place for the plane to stay except on the runway. On the runway are other airplanes as well. Thus, the correct answer is D.<n><n>### Why you got it right, or why your solution was correct:<n>The answer "A: war" is incorrect because no airplanes in a war are going to be used. The war ends, the airplanes are destroyed, and there's no point in using them anymore.<n>The answer "B: aircraft carrier" is incorrect because an aircraft carrier can only hold those airplanes while they're going to or coming from a mission. While they're docked, airplanes can be made use of again. <n>The answer "C: sky" is incorrect because the sky is where airplanes are used in most frequent sense. If you're flying, you're already using them!<n>The answer "D: graveyard" is correct because, if they don't get to be used, they'll get broken and left there on land never to be used, not to mention that airplanes cost a lot of money, so it's cheaper to go to a graveyard then make one.<n>The answer "E: crash" is incorrect because, obviously, airplanes don't crash very often, and when they do, there's usually some reason for it.<n>

Cube games have only one dimension, which is why they are played with just the cube.<n><n>### InputHow many sides does a cube have?<n><n>###  Response: <n><n><n>    A cube has six sides, but they are all identical. So, a cube has six identical sides and six identical faces. The cube has six sides (2-dimensional figures) and six squares (3-dimensional figures)<n>    A cube is also known as an "orthohedral solid".<n><n>### Input   144<n><n>### Response :<n>A: 144 is exactly equal the surface area of a cube of unit length 1. Which means that all edges of the cube are equal!<n>This is because in a cube of length 1 each dimensions of the cube have the same unit length. So, this cube has to have exactly 1 length, 1 width, and 1 height. Also, when you calculate the surface area of this unit cube, you end up with 144, because you multiply the length 1 by the width, height, and volume. Each of these has unit length, and therefore the sum of them has unit length too, and so it will be equal to 144.<n>Besides not having side, the cube only has one surface, because it has only length, and height and has no width. Hence,<n>C: 144. The 1 dimensional cube is a unit cube because all of its sides are same length and there are six of them.<n><n>### How many points does a 3x3 magic 31 grid contain?<n><n>### Solution<n>A:   37<n>### How many blocks do you need to move in order to get every vertical 7-block sequence?<n><n>### B: 2<n><n><n><n>

E: freezer <n><n><n>## Explanation<n>I think the question is asking you to think logically about the question. <n>I am going with answer b because a ham sandwich doesn't have meat it has ham, I see the question as an analogy to meat, so if you take the meat out it's still fresh. <n>In short, the meat, if you think about it, stays a long time.<n><n>### Follow up<n>1.

If a $1 coin has 21.58 grams of silver in it, how much silver is in 21 $1 coins?<n><n>This problem has a simple math solution, where we can easily determine that $21 * 21.5 = 459 grams.  However, the math will fail for a variety of other problems, e.g., there are different weights for different denominations for which arithmetic fails, e.g., the quarter is lighter than the dime.  The math fails for other reasons: for example, a coin, if shaped as a square of side l, has a volume V = l^2 h/2 where h is of length d where d = 2r.  Hence, a square shaped penny will have much more volume than a one-third-copper and two-thirds-zinc coin such as a dime, since the volume V = l^3/3h. In short, arithmetic fails to solve such problems because it fails even to give the answer to questions such as "how much silver is in 459 grins?" but it is also not enough to say "use log" because there are situations such as "how much does one-third-cooper and two-thirds zinc cost to one-

The'mat' object is located at the top.<n><n>### Input:"Find the total products of all integers in these arrays that are multiples of 5"<n><n>### Example:<n><n>>>> def find_products_of_5(mat5):<n>...     total_products = 0<n><n>>>> for i in range(len(array_nums)):<n><n>...     total_num = array_nums[i]<n><n>...     if total_num % 5 == 0 and (total_products % 5) == 0:<n>...         total_products += total_num<n><n>>>> print(find_products_of_3(mat5))<n><n>### Explanations:The first loop iterates through the arrays'mat2' and'mat3' starting at 0.  On each iteration of the loop, the inner loop iterates through the array and checks to verify if the number contained in the array is a multiple of 5.  The last line of the example function defines the product between the integer to be checked and the value of the previous line, or the value of 'total_num % 5' in this case.  On the last iteration of the inner loop, the function is checking the final value inside'mat4', and the value of 'total' will be multiplied by the product that is stored for 'i' which is the last index in the arrays'mat2','mat3', and'mat4'.  Remember'mat4' is stored in alphabetical order.<n><n>### Exercises:<n><n>### Instinct your Tips:<n><n>### Find the total products of all even integers in these arrays that is a multiple of 9<n><n>### Instict your Tips for this Exercise:<n><n><n>### Exercise:<n>You're using the same array object (mat4),

Choices:  A: contagious B: wrong C: last forever D: painful E: blind<n><n>### Response:		Love is A: contagious<n><n>### Explanation:A. You cannot explain love, but you can only feel it. You cannot force love from another. It is not painful, but beautiful. To love is to hurt, to be hurt, and to move on.<n><n>### Examples:<n>1. You love your parents. If you can’t hug me right now, please know that I’m holding you in my thoughts and prayers.<n><n>2. Dad, I love you as much as I did when I was twelve. I love mom and I love my dorky brothers. I wish I could have been a better child and I hate that you had to take on parenthood solo and I know it was hard. I don’t know if I can ever tell you what I really wanted to say, what I wish I had told you sooner because it feels like I’m just breaking a huge part of my heart to tell you this.<n><n>3. You know, they say one of the biggest acts of love is to give up on someone. For so long I couldn’t give up on us, even when I knew our love wasn’t worth it. But it’s not a good idea to fight for something as long as this. There comes a time when it’s better to let go. The hardest part is knowing, and seeing the signs, and not acting.<n><n>### Choice:C: last forever<n><n>### Explation:C. It’s hard to find the right words. But when love is true, you do not have to find the exact right words, because the feelings, and heart and emotion already tell the other person.

That means there needs to be.00015 quarters in the set. That means the set must be one hundred and fifty quarters.<n>- if you only have $142 worth copper, the quarters are off by two. Also, the other sets could be off two too, so that $5 is only worth $4.20 worth of copper. That means that there must be only 66 quarters in the set, and there is no way of filling that coin set up to fill up $500. There must be only one set for the quarters because they aren't enough coins to fill $500<n>- if you have $.01 less copper than you need, the dimes will be off by two. The three sets have to be within one dime. That means if you have too little copper, there have to be only 199 dimes for the set. It

That makes it hard for people to grasp what's happening and how the budget cuts might impact them.  One example is a program to help families with four or more children. About 33,000 women rely on the Women, Infants and Children program in Arizona.  The state decided to cut that program by 70%, and women were justifiably alarmed.  So, one Arizona congressman decided to illustrate how big the cuts would be.  He laid his congressional salary and a $100 paycheck for his son on a table in front of his district office and asked a local reporter to stand in for the single mom.  Then he did the math with his hands.  That reporter wrote a story after that.<n><n>## Input question: What is a person doing (not saying) in the scenario presented?

Choices:  A: interesting B: fun C: joyful or painful D: very important E: free<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>My first instinct may just be to add more interesting activities in learning the material we're studying. I wouldn't choose D because learning is never free. Even when someone is given a free education, they still must do a lot of work themselves in order to comprehend the material. I feel that learning material that is too uninteresting may be a better way to not like learning at all because it takes the joy out of learning to where it may not be considered an enjoyable activity anymore, and it would be better if there was something that was more fun to do rather than simply doing homework. I would also choose A because if the curriculum and the teaching of the class are boring to someone who is learning, they will most likely not enjoy learning no matter what they're doing. It takes someone with skill and motivation to be a good teacher who can engage students, and the teacher could try a lot of different activities to try to get the students interested in the material to try to improve their classroom experience.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: shelf B: desktop C: cabinet D: kitchen E: cupboard<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>In this situation I would choose option C. The only appropriate place for putting my coffee mug is the cabinet. The other options are inappropriate for my coffee mug since the shelf is not where I keep my coffee mug, nor do I keep it on my desk since the mug is not a laptop. The cabinet was the first and only place that I thought of putting my coffee mug.<n><n>### Input<n><n>The number 40242 has two digits, each used once. What number could they have been?<n><n>### Response<n><n>The correct answer that I came up with was 2714 after I thought I was wrong.  My response was 2712 because I thought in order for the number to work it would have needed two zeroes, but when I added up all the digits on the number it worked out as 2712.  I have learned from this experience that numbers have to go in order, so I couldn't have put a 6 and a 2 together.  I would recommend for you to make sure one number goes with another since it could have caused me a headache.<n><n>### Inspiration<n>This task inspired me to think differently, and to not just consider the digits 0-9.

However, I am pretty sure the correct answer is 2714. I think the number you have here is two digits, not two digits each as I initially interpreted it.  I have never seen numbers that were two digits used once for each digit before, hence I never thought of that possibility.<n><n>### Actions<n><n>- Read peers writing<n>- Review rubric for peer response<n>- Look at Peer's code again and suggest changes to it for better clarity<n>- Use what peers feedback to revise my own work<n>- Edit responses to show I have read peers work, their suggestions, and applied revisions they made.<n><n>### Conclusion<n>It would have been smarter to not be so literal with this task.

Choices:  A: classroom B: synagogue C: bathroom D: front porch E: grocery store<n><n>### Response:		<n>To answer this question, a first step is to identify the key term<n>in the problem.  The key term in this problem would be “the”<n>which suggests that you should look for an indicator word such<n>as "the."  Let’s consider the other choices and rule out<n>those that are clearly incorrect.  In choices A, B, and E,<n>there is the definite article “the” implying that you<n>should search for an indicator word to identify the newspaper<n>that the person is getting.  Choice D is unlikely as we expect<n>the paper to be delivered to the house in question, either to<n>the front door or a designated mail slot.  Since the paper<n>in question is received in “the” morning, choice C is not<n>likely either.  When you narrow down the choices to choice<n>B and C you are looking at two common locations to find<n>newspapers.<n><n>This question has two possible solutions to choose from.<n>If the newspaper receiver is Jewish, he is more likely to<n>receive his newspaper at Shabbos (as we would expect to see<n>in choice B) than during weekday service (as with choice<n>C).  The next key word is synagogue, so we need to look<n>for “synagogue” in the other answers.  While there are several<n>synagogues near Gail’s home, we need to assume that her<n>family is attending a local synagogue.  Therefore, the most<n>likely answer is choice B.<n><n>### Input/Response:<n>This person is asking me to explain my problem.  This person would like my<n>input on how to begin the problem-solving process. This is not a question,<n>per se, but an instruction to provide guidance.<n><n>This person can simply ask me for more information.  If this<n>person knows this person, this person might ask "Who are you<n>doing your math homework with?"<n><n>Input/Response:<n>This is not an instruction since it only describes and does not ask.<n><n>### Direction:Review the response.<n><n>In this response, I was looking at my friends homework.

They can cause broken ribs, collapsed lungs and internal damage to your organs.Driving while under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol is a significant concern when you think about safety. People who drive under the influence are more likely to cause accidents.If your vehicle isn’t in good condition, you’ll probably be involved in an accident. Make sure to check the brakes, tires, wiper blades, headlights, fluid levels, airbags, etc.<n><n>Safety is more than just what you wear on your skin. Think how important it is to use seat belts, helmets, and to keep the roads and cars in good condition.

In the first question, she had more than enough money to buy presents for the entire list she presented, but she still didn't buy anything because she was unhappy about an ex-boyfriend. In the problem she had money but was still unhappy because she had to share the presents with her best friend. This would leave her in a predicament to have to buy even more. Therefore, happiness and money are the problems in the examples.<n><n>### The Answer:  <n>A: B: C: D: E:<n><n>### Input Choices:<n><n>### Response Choices:<n><n><n>

They decide to share a car and take turns driving. If Jill and Maria each only have enough money to pay one week’s bus pass, how much money should each pay and how many days will it take for them to make the payment?<n><n>### Example 1:<n><n>The cost to make the payment equal $60. You could say $60 = $30 for each journey or $30 for both journeys. However, that means that you have to pay twice the money you were originally expecting ($30 as opposed to $15), making it impossible to make the payment unless you pay twice as much.<n><n>The only way for this to be possible is if the cost is $15 for each person.<n><n>### Demo:<n><n>#### Example 1:<n>Jon is running from his mom's house to the grocery store. It costs 33 cents to take the bus, but that takes 20 minutes because the bus is usually full. Jon runs so fast that he takes 5 seconds less per mile than the bus (so each mile he runs costs 63 cents). The bus stops at the grocery store, where Jon can eat while he waits for the next bus back to his mom's house. For every 5 miles that Jon runs, he saves 1 dollar in bus fare; this means that the distance is equal to the bus fare (33 cents). Jon decides to run to the grocery after a week of working on the house. His mom lives 4.5 miles away and the grocery store is 1

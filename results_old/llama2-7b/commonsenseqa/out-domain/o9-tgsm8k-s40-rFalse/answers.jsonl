The Fibonacci sequence is where you start with 0 and 1, or 1 and 1, or another pair. The consecutive numbers are found by adding the preceding number to the one before.

{"text": "D\n\n### \ud83d\udcd9 Read the following passage:\nThis is a story about two young girls who wanted to become professional football players.  They started playing football when they were four-years old, and have never looked back. One of the girls had two brothers who played football, and she loved going to the games with her parents and brothers, and when she was old enough she would spend her entire Saturday playing football with her two brothers until they came home. It was easy for her, since she had always been around the football all her life, so it came easy and natural to her.\n\nWhen she became twelve years old, she decided that she was going to start using her talents to actually make it big time, so that was when she and her mother met together, and they worked out a strict exercise routine for her. Now she was ready to take on the world. It was easy for this twelve year old girl to impress people with her talents, while she was in her teenage years. It was natural for her, since she was around the football for many years, and now she was determined to show the world, that her hard work and her talent could take her all the way. She did whatever she could to help impress the professional coaches and scouts, by showing she was determined to do whatever it took to win.\n\nAt the age of sixteen, she started to receive hundreds of letters and e-mails, telling her to attend an interscholastic tryout camp. She was determined that she was not going to miss this chance, that would hopefully give her the opportunity that she was looking to receive. She did everything in her power to perform well at the camp, because she knew that everyone would be watching her closely. She had already received all the attention from the previous years of being good, but she also wanted the chance to perform in front of professional coaches and scout. She did not want to miss this opportunity for herself, which was so much in demand, and if she did not show up when the chances are given for everyone, then she might be missed. There are no second chances when this type of thing happens, so you must be there, when the opportunities arise. \n\n### \u2753 Multiple choice question\n\n### Input :\nChoices:\n\nThe author uses the term \u201cthat\u2019s not true\u201d (line 24)\n\n##", "answer": "E: children suffer"}

One strategy for completing the task was to measure each stick separately and record the results. From the list of sticks, measure the longest stick first, next the second longest stick, then the smallest, next the middle, and finally the third longest. Note that if the third longest stick is shorter than the middle longest, it is too short to be counted in the three that are longer than 10 centimeters. To count the heights of the other stick, note that the shortest stick is shorter than any of the other 3, and this is measured the same as the fourth stick that did not count for 15 centimeter criteria. The other fourth stick that is the second smallest does not need to be measure separately as it is longer than the other small stick.\n\n### Input - In the number line.0,2,4,6,8,10 Include the values of: A: 20 B:9 C:0 D:12 E:13,14,15,16,17 F:29,29\n\n### Demos:12\n\n### Response:\"A,B,C,D,E\"\n\n### Input-You can take 35 seconds to run three laps around the track at normal walking speed and 62 seconds to run three lakes at a fairly brisk jog.

{"text": "The easiest way to complete the instruction and to ensure that you're following the requirements is to start by selecting the only possible choices for the initial state. The instructions state that whether or not you choose the correct one, the outcome will always be a binary choice where there might either be just A or B. This effectively means that there are only four possible options available to test.\nFor simplicity's sake, you could list the variables that make up your choice as, [01, 02, 03, 04] since the values that the computer will use will never exceed 19. Once you've done this, you can use your knowledge of how the computer works and how binary works to find the corresponding value that has been stated in the instructions. The four letters that represent the possible outcomes are not the choice being asked about, and therefore, the question cannot be answered. It is only a placeholder for a computer to use a variable on the output side.\n\nIn order to answer the remaining questions, you should always start with the value of each input to identify the possible outcomes. As for the other questions, you should remember that the answers provided are always the opposite of the question asked. For example, A = 0, B = 1, and so on. This makes it easy as well since one question might already have been asked, which will allow you to figure out the next one simply by flipping the answer.\n\n### Inputs: \nA: [2,1,3,4]\n\n### Outputs:\n1.

Some mathematicians had noticed that there was still a lot of mathematics to be done in the realm of integer divisibility, yet all of the known methods to solve integer divisibility problems involved some form of trial and error. This trial and error method of problem solving takes up a lot of time and effort, so it was important to find a better way. It was then discovered that a new branch of mathematics was created by a Polish Jew named Solomon Lefschetz, which he called \u201cnumber theory\u201d. Lefschetz and others at the time were thinking about numbers, as he was a well-known French mathematician. And it also helped people see that many abstract things we have today are based on mathematical principles and rules, like geometry or the rules for adding two or more whole numbers. Now in the early nineteenth century another French mathematician, Auguste Renoir, had written about these concepts and the number theory movement that were gaining popularity.\n\nThe idea was that if you started from the concept of a number in everyday life, you could think carefully to make one of the rules of arithmetic clearer and more universal. And so, it was easy to figure out that 2+2 = 4. But what about the addition of the higher numbers? How easy would that be? Mathematicians would say, \u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t be so easy.\u201d That was a good point, because for centuries mathematicians had thought that the number 0 was just 0, like an idea that didn\u2019t exist or had no existence in the real world.\n\nBut a few years later, this new idea changed everything, and people in other disciplines were able to use the math of number theory as well. The first great example of this was Einstein himself. He had an interest in physics and was also thinking about these kinds of problems, like the one about the equation x = 0 and whether it was valid in the real world.", "answer": "A: tree tops"}

In this question the number of DOBERMANS is 20. So how many were the SCHNAUZES? That is exactly 55. As you can see in the picture below. \n\n **For the 2nd one:**\n\nIn that question the given answer is 36 which means if you do the number by hand is correct. If we're not that good with that or it's too slow in doing the operations we can use the formula:\nsum of the numbers = 2 x (number of months with double amount)/2 + 2 times it's own number.\nand in this formula the given numbers is:\n(95-40)/2 + 2*40 = 49\nand to confirm it we can use calculator, the answer is ACTUALLY: 36.\n\n **For the third one:** \n\nThis question is pretty straight forward. You just need to understand it carefully. So lets start with the first group of numbers. These are 110. Then you multiply it by 4 which gives you this: 440. So this means that the number of players for woodwinds is 440. \n\n **The fourth one:**\n\nThis problem can be solved really fast, just like the second one, you need the formula to speed it up. Here it is:\n(4 x (age+8)) = age+sum of ages/4 then if you don't know how to find the sum of your own age you can use this formula as well: sum of ages = (1/2 your age) x (total years you live). So now we use this formulas:\n(4* [ Christian age + 8] )= Christian age + 248\nif you just solved it by hand it'll be really slow and hard because the numbers are just too big.

A program has many different input-output pairs, similar to this task. In one context, a program might have one task. In another one, such as the code above, it has one input and two subtasks followed by a choice. An algorithm is a way to solve any problem.\n\n### To complete a programming task, write a program. Your program should use control structures to execute all parts of the programming task. There are two ways to solve program problems -- with loops, or with conditions. Looping statements, such as while or do..loop will execute the same statements over and over, until some condition is met. A condition can be something like \"x < 10\". If it is greater than 10, the loop will continue. Conditional statements, such as if or elseif, are true or false expressions. If the condition is true, the first result is executed. Otherwise, the second result is executed. This method works when the number of possible options is limited, like the number of days in February.\n\n### If you need more information, you can look at the program.html file in the home folder on this exercise (under home) after you have completed it, or in the course notes under section SOLUTIONS.", "answer": "D: carry people"}

{"text": "If there is a bus station at the intersection of Street and School, that doesn't qualify as a good place for the station, since every school student would go to it. But, that intersection is not at the centre of the city, so that can't be good, either. In order to choose the best bus station, we'll need to find a convenient place that isn't at the centre of the town, but isn't at the city boundaries.\n\nIf the bus station is at the centre of the intersection, it should be a good place for bus station, as long as there are no other bus stations. But, we already discovered that every school student would visit it, so it wouldn't be a good place for the bus station. If the station were on the street, then every passer-by (including school students) would be able to easily access the bus station, but not every bus travelling through the town would be able to easily locate the bus station. Thus, neither Street nor Intersection would be good places for a bus station.\n\nIf the station is at the intersection of City and School, then every pass-by will stop near this intersection, while all of the school students will always stop by the bus station. It will also be easier to stop by the bus station from the city centre, so they won't need to go through town to get to the bus station. However, the intersection between Street and City isn't convenient either, so it wouldn' forget it. Finally, the intersection between School and Street is also inconvenient.

It goes to Chicago where it drops 12 passengers.  What's the population of Boston, in 1000s? (Hint, if x is the population of Boston, then the answer is 364 +x - 6x and the 12 represents the fraction of passengers left to be dropped off; therefore, we want to subtract the 12 from the fraction to get x. So, we want to subtract 12 from the subtraction of the fraction. So, divide both of the terms by 6.

A big house/big city would mean a very large, urban location.  E: The couple are moving out of the city and keep their personal objects - so that excludes a big city.

He put 12 coins in each pile, How many coins are in the 1 with 15 coins?\n\n### Response :The correct answer is a D (3)\n\n### Demission:If you go all the way down to the bottom of 1 pile, that's 25 coins. Remove that many from the one pile and the one left has 12 coins.  Subtract 6 from 12 and the number in the one left is 6.  You subtract 4 from 9 and the number that's left is 5.  So, you end with 3 in that last pile.\n### Input :\nMs. Smith bought a bag of candy at a cost of $3.79 and then bought 4 bags of candy with $16.

{"text": "B\n\n### Input\nA group of musicians wants to have a playoff against another group of musicians. However, they want to even the group of musicians so that no one person will have an advantage over the other. However, they can't be too even in number because in evenly matched playoffs the advantage moves from person to person over several plays. For this playoffs, the team will play three 3-on-3 matches, then each member of the team will select a player to join them for the one on one match. Whomever wins the one on one match wins 4 points, if it is a tie both sides will get 2 points. If a team wins the match they get 3 points for each member of the team except for for the captain who will get 1 point. If the match is a tie each side will get 1 point for each member of the group. If any more than two members of the team pick the same person to be on their matchup, the matchup will be canceled and the members would be split up into two teams of 2. There would be no points gained for the original matchup. If any members of the team pick a person not available, the team would lose out on the points of the members who chose an unavailable member, thus it is not advisable to pick the same person twice on more than a match and a tie in.\n\n### Response\nThere are 6 musicians in the group. The captain is chosen to be a member of each team, and the remaining 5 members are spread out onto the two teams such that no one member can be chosen twice for the one on one matches. That is, no member is available to play in only one on one matches or in only the 3 matchup. The winning team will get 4 points for each member of their team. The losing team will get 3 points for their captain and 2 points for each of their members if they lost.  For the tie breaker, the captain would get 1 point and the 2 member team would get 1 point each, giving the captain team a total of 8 points and the other team 9. So, the winning team wins 12 points and the losing team wins 15 points.\nThis playoff was successful at balancing the team.

As sellers are forced to sell at higher prices, they may limit supplies in order to generate more revenue. \n* Demand Curve: If supply increases, for whatever reason, the demand curve will shift to the right.

The next group leaving will have three times the number of grownups than the group of 30 children, plus 12 more people.  The next group leaving will be the same size as the last group.  All other groups will be five people smaller.  When will the 95th people leave?\n\n### Correct Response\nThe 95th person leaves at around 12:20\n\n### Instructions\nWrite an alternative explanation to the above\n\n### Example Answer\nThere will be 10 groups of 30 people each. 9:00 is just a time when the first kids will leave.  If they count backwards you always have one less from group 4.  Also this means that the last group of people, 265, leave 8 minutes after the above answer.\n\n### Example Wrong Answer\nThere are 250 people who leave at 9:00, but at the end we said they only go until 12:23.  So at some point it becomes \"not enough\" people because 6:23 is 22 after 6.\n\n### Alternative Answer\n\nThe number of people leaving is the number of people left, rounded down. The number of people left after rounding down is the next group and so on. I got 95 at 12:21.\n\n### Correct Answers\nIncorrect.

{"text": "C\n\n### Instructions:\nWhen your code passes the lint stage, move on to part 1 of the challenge.  This part is designed to introduce you to the structure of a real Python program by prompting you to create a file in your project root that has 3 different functions, read 1 more function from its documentation, and pass 1 function as a parameter to another.   You can write any code you like in this file as long as it includes at least one argument and one parameter, each one of which takes a string as its only input.\n\nYour challenge for the first part of the challenge is to read the documentation for the different standard python types, then write up a function that takes a string as a parameter and prints its character length.\n\n### Part 1:\n\n1. Create the file `exercise_1.py` in the root of your project.  In the first line of that file, add the following import statement: `import typing as t`.   (typing is a library that all Python programs must import before using Python's standard types and functions.  See the documentation in [the typing module here](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/typing.html).  You can simply run `import typing as t` in your prompt to get the module imported.)\n\n1. Within your exersice_1.py file, add one function called `string_lenth`, which takes a single string of text as its parameter and prints its length.  For example, calling  `string_lenth(\"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\")` should print `9`.\n\n1. Next, write another function,  `word_length`, that takes a string as its parameter, and prints the length of the longest word contained within the string.  So for example, calling    `word_length(\"the quick brown foz jumps over the lazy hound\")` should print `6`.\n\nNow that you have the core functionality of your first program, get your code through the lint stage.\n\n1. From terminal (or command-prompt or equivalent), navigate to your project directory.\n\n1. Make your best effort to fix any lint errors (it might be helpful to open your errors.log file with an editor before making improvements).\n\n1.

It is their children. So their children's age will be their sports age too. In sports, there should be two teams such as the opposing teams and they always play against each other. When the parents said to their children that they should learn teamwork, they meant the kids will learn the teamwork which means they'll be working as a team even with the same age. This means that the activity is playing the same age competitive events.\n\n### Inputs: The store had twice as many customers as last Thursday.  On Wednesday the store had one-half as many customers as Monday.  How many customers were there on Thursday?\n\n### Responses:\n\n#### B\n\nThere were 85 customers on Thursday, on the question they asked how many customers were there on Wednesday. From the question, I can guess that Monday had the least number of people who went at the store compared to Wednesday so there were less people. From this question, they know how many people went on Wednesday. And for Thursday it had a total that was twice as much as last thursday so it had double people went. So Thursday was almost half of Monday. This means that on Wednesday there were 10 more people and in two days there was four times as many people. If I multiply 10 which equals 10, by four which equals 4, then 10 x 4 equals 40 people.\n\n#### C\n\nThis is the response they were looking for: There were 8 customers on Thursday\n\nThere were twice as many customers on Wednesday as on Monday, so there were 40 customers on Wednesday\n\nThere were 40/2=20 twice as many people on Wednesday as Monday\n\nTo find the answer, we multiply 20\u00d74=80(they gave us the answer for each day)\n\n80-40=40 customers on Thursday.\n\n### References\n\nMirror", "answer": "B: play sports"}

Is there a better synonym for choice D? Why?\n- Could be either E or B\n- There is no specific term besides embarrassment that communicates the concept \"I'm feeling embarrassment because it is such an ordinary complaint\"\n3. What is the difference between the synonym for choice B (emotional) and the synonym for the original choice E (humiliation)?\n- Humiliation is a more intense version of pain.  It is feeling that one has lost face or status in front of another.\n- Emotional is a way that pain is experienced by someone on the inside and is not necessarily directed outward.\n4. What word might not need to be synonymed? Why?\n- Pain is already synonymed with two similar words.  The \"self pity\" already carries the idea of having lost face or status.\n- The sentence is trying to convey a specific reaction to an injury.

I don't understand why it is coming out 4613 instead, however.\n\n### Exaplanation for solution:\nAfter looking at both your explanations, I am realizing that I need to be a bit more precise in my solution. The sum of 1 + ((32 + 9n)/2) = 33n/2. In order for the sum to equal 24, which you said it does, n would need to be 1.

Also, Rex had four more friends than Scooper (the total was 4 less than Rex) so add Rex\u2019s four more friends to the total from Rex, which equals 3.\n\n\n## Instructions for completing:\n\n- A sentence, paragraph, or passage written in another language that needs to be translated into English.\n- A mathematical problem that involves arithmetic, algebra, geometry, data analysis, number sense, probability, and statistics.\n- A situation that involves two or more parties, e.g. parent and child, or coworker and coworker, that could cause disagreement or disputes if not handled properly. \n\n## Instrucitons for completing:\n- A sentence in which one of the words or phrases has been replaced by a blank indicating what you think the missing word should be. \n- A question that can be answered \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d \u201cmaybe,\u201d or with a number.\n\n## Instrucorion for completing:\n  A statement that requires a response of \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno.\u201d\n  A statement that asks which of two or three possibilities is correct.\n## Instructorion for completing:You are given a specific sentence that requires you to write a true and/or false statement.\n## Instrucorions for completing:You must answer the", "answer": "B: gaining knowledge"}

Dr. Banks gives each patient a toothbrush with $2.75 written on it to clean their teeth. By midday, on average he has given away the toothbrushes listed in the table below. If each patient has more than one problem tooth but no more than two, how many teeth, on average, can Dr. Banks clean?\n | Number of Toothbrushes Given per Patient   | Number of Teeth\n---|---|---\n | 157 | 128\n4 | 202 | 136\n3 | 192 | 140\n  | 138 | 132\nNone  | 233 | 136  \n      \n\n### Explanation:  The given table shows the number of patients he has seen from 8 am - midday, and shows the number of toothbrushes he has given. There is no entry for 5, which means it has been given out less than three times. The number of teeth being given to is equal to the average number of patients x the average number of toothbrushing. 2.75 x 128 = 345, on average. 2.7 would go to half as many patients as would 5. Because of the half being applied to a smaller number of patients, the average given per patient goes down to 2.7.  Multiplying a half x an average of 128 patients = an average of 52 teeth given per patient.", "answer": "C: cow"}

{"text": "A\n\n### Output:How to find the square root:  _____, 2649, 68, or 499?\n\n### Explanation:\nThere are three simple and accurate methods of  computing the square root of any number:\n\n- Take the number's last two digits.  Multiply the product of those last two digits by that number.   Add two to the previous figure.  Divide the result by 2\u2014then repeat (this may be the hardest part) and continue until you get the same result as an answer below:\n\n$\\sqrt68=(6\\times2)+4+2=24$\n\n*$\\sqrt2649=(2\\times25)+5+2=81$\n\n*$\\square$\n\n- Square both digits of the number and take the difference of their results:\n\n$\\sqrt499=1\\times 1+2=3$\n\n* $\\qquad$\n\n- Repeated  multiplications:\n\n$\\sqrt 2649=2\\times 12649>$\n\n$\\sqrt 1264 =1264 \\times \\sqrt{1} +$\n\n$\\sqrt{1256} = 1256\\times 1$\n\n$\\sqrt1256=64, \\sqrt264 = 13$\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt 1256+\\sqrt 13}{2} = 15,\\therefore \\frac {\\sqrt 499}{2}= 2^{1/2}\\approx 1.4148 $\n\n(The second calculation uses a division with remainder by 2, which can be done any number of times, and will never produce a different answer than when the entire calculation is done using multiplication.  Multiplications only do what you give them so if the number were in the denominator, they would result in wrong answers.)\n\nTo  find the square root of a whole number, which is any natural number, do not factor it out.  Instead, simply divide  by 2 and see the decimal places in the number and repeat if necessary.  You can use the whole number and the square of the number or square root as a denominator.

However, I am not able to make a decision, when it comes to these types of questions, without being sure if there are any clues in the statement regarding \"governor, Miss, or MIss\" when it comes to the possible state with the governor's office. So I would need more information if there was any clues regarding \"governor MISS\" or even \"MISS governor\". This is another way to determine if it should be MISS or MISSISSIPPI. In this case it must be MISSISSIPI as in the statement it would indicate E. So choice C is correct.\n\n### Expected Output:C\n\n### Source\n```\n[25]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_a_U.S._state\n[26]: http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joe_Nascone/The_Difference_Between_Right_and_Left\n```", "answer": "E: mississippi"}

But now we can do that and make our code even more elegant by removing the code that handles the empty input and error checking as well as removing code redundancies.\n\n#### Redundancies\n\nHere is the part that handles the invalid input.\n\n```python\nif len(input_message) == 0:\n    print(\"Please enter an input.\")\n```\n\nWe already verified that we have input so we do not need to check how many characters it has.\n\n```python_\nif len(input) == 0: \n```\n\nIn this case, the user did not input anything and we return an empty string. We can handle that with a else branch, however we are now redundant with what we already handled earlier.\n\n```python \nelif len(input)!= 0:\n    choice = \"\"\n    \n    \n    try:\n        input_array = input_message.lower().split()\n        output_array = word_list.split()\n\n```\n\nAfter checking if the input is empty, we check to see if it has the correct length. This is redundant because we already checked to see if is empty, we do not need to repeat that check.\n\n```python  \n    \n    if input_array == \"\":\n        choice = 0\n    elif len(input_array)!=3:\n        print(\"Invalid input.

As a result, he has no way to communicate with Jane and Julie.\n\n## \t\n\nEach time this young man finds the sum of a triple (a set consisting of three numbers), he writes it down and places it in the middle of a line on a table. A \"line\" can be thought of as a sequence. \n\nFor instance, consider the sequence A7323.\n\nIt is a sequence where A is the first number in the sequence, 7 is the second, and so on. The numbers are written from first to last in a forward direction; the numbers are written from back to front in a reverse direction.\n\nEach day, there are 2 new triplets to put into the sequence. If the sequence looks like this: A1923, then the young man decides which number to put in the first position; he can put either 2 or 1 in there.\n\nThere is no limit on any of the numbers in the sequence. The young man will always have the same triplet of numbers. This sequence is called A*1923. \n\nYou should think of the triple as representing the three girls in the sequence. You should think of one triple after another as the three girls making a pact with one number each in front of them.\n\nLet's consider one such pact among three girls: Julie, Jane, and Tessa. Julie, Jane, Tessa represent the triple. The numbers go in the order from \"first to last\" like so: Janet, 345, 5", "answer": "C: winning or losing"}

{"text": "If you were to guess which one would be most likely to contain valuable objects, most likely it would be A and E. Airport is a place you don\u2019t want to lose your passport. You would carry that in your front pocket or purse or backpack. If you lost your passport you would want to report it right away or be held responsible for a replacement cost.\n### The second selection that deals with jewelry might be a jewelry store. You wouldn\u2019t go into a jewelry shop and drop your expensive watch into an open pile of other people\u2019s watches. That would be a waste of a potential diamond. It would be a waste of time not to find your own jewels as well.  Garbage cans are also not the best place to store jewelry. Too many people dump or discard their old pieces of jewelry in the garbage can. Some people like the fact that the jewelry will never be seen again.  To people like that, their heart doesn\u2019t have value.  But to me, a garage means more space and more items, which means more things are important to the homeowner. This is just wrong.  The garbage truck is too much of an inconvenience to go to pick it up and take it back home again.  So it\u2019s best to find a place that you will not easily forget to go to find your jewelry.  The laundry room would be such a place. \n### Another thing I want to mention to you is how I think about my family and friends more than anything else, because of how I love my family and friends.  This gives me a different idea of what is good and bad.  One of my best friends told me his best friends got married on the same day as my best friends.

Be sure to explain your thought process while trying to complete each of these questions.\n\n### Sample question #1:\nThe marching band has 98 members.  There are twice as many drummers as flutes, and 3 times as many flutes as trumpets.  How many trumpet players are there?\n\n### Sample answer #1:\nI will first write the expression as a system of linear equations, which can be accomplished by using the addition-subtraction property and properties of equality. We can write the given information as 18 + 7 + 24 = 78 and 30 + 12 = 54. Then we substitute the total member variable as 98 and eliminate the multiplication part of the equation as 24x7 = 168 and 21x3 = 63. Then we substitute the number of trumpets into the second equation.   We arrive at the following system:  24x7 =  63 - 112x 3x7  21x3 =  63 +112x 2x7  Since we have two equations, two variables, the system of linear equations is in consistent system of equations  There is no real solution.  \n\n### Sample response #2:\nOne of the questions requires knowledge of linear equations in two variables. It states that a marching band has 26 members.  There are as many brass instruments as woodwind and one-half as many woodwind instruments as percussion.  How many marching band members are there? \n\n### Sample solution #2:\nThe total member variables 26 is expressed as 13 + 13 + 6.  Then by the same process as in the last question, we end up with a situation like this and is not feasible by a linear equation:  3x6 =  6 + 4x4x6 We cannot make it consistent.\n\n### Response time:1 hour. \n\n### Output files location\nC:\\Code\n\n### Questions regarding this report \n> Question:\n> > \tIs this", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

How high can the top of the box lid be, if it matches the rest of the parameters?\n\n### Response\nThe most simple solution is to construct a square frame inside the box lid that matches the size of the base. Then the lid can be cut in strips horizontally to make one strip long enough for the height of the box.\n\nThe area = height * width = \\large \\large 24 = (14 cm * width)\n\nwidth = height/14 = 14/14 = 4cm sq.\n\nheight = 4 * 8 = 4 * 25/100 = 10\n\n### \n### You find your car keys at the top of the desk drawer, but you can\u2019t fit both arms down the drawer to get them.

The same thing can happen if you buy the ticket to the theater, but it is a little bit distracted.\n\nThe conference is not for people.

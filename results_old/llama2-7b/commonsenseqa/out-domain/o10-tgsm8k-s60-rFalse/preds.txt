We lived in a small home which we were able to buy after Mommy and Daddy’s death. They were very sick, so we had them moved to an institution.

I sleep on a tiny bed in one corner and there’s only one window which was broken and left empty. Sometimes the old lady I live with brings me a blanket, and sometimes she doesn’t. After she takes her bath at night, she covers everything in her house and locks the front door so I can’t get out. Mom always told me to be careful, because the old lady in the house can sometimes be cruel to us.  The old lady’s name is Mom, but she’s never really been a very good mom.”<n><n>#### Lunch Time<n><n>Grandpa says: “I don’t know where I came from; I just found myself in this kitchen.

The sunlight shines in and warms me. I think of the food that I like, like cookies and chicken, and I think of the times when I have had them.  Sometimes I think about how old I am. I know that I’ll live until I get really old, but I don’<n>t have a lot of time. I think I’ll just do things

If, for example, you were asked to convert a 12 (base 10) to a 6 (base 2), your algorithm would need to get the first set of 3 numbers and know what base you are converting from to use. In this algorithm, the input number that you use to determine your new digits is your base. This is called the modulus. Write your program to take a number, determine your new base, and display the number in that base.<n>Your algorithm should take the number as input from the user.<n>Use the modulus. The modulus is a method for extracting a number from a larger number. The modulus will give you the first set of digits, or your new base.<n>Your method will take two inputs, x and y. The x represents your current base.<n>The y will be the modulus.<n>Then you will take that modulus and figure out the remainder. You determine the remainder based on if it is greater than or less than ten.<n>If it is less than ten, you take that remainder x+1. If it is greater than ten, you subtract ten from to it then add one. Then you put it back as a string.<n>If the remainder is 0, you multiply the modulus by the number that is remaining. In this case, y x 0.<n><n>Your output is a string of digits that are the representation of the original number in your new base.<n><n>### Sample Inputs and Output:<n>1Input: 14; Input base: 10<n>Output: 14 (converted to binary)<n>2Input: 12 (Base: 10)<n>Output: 4 (converted to hexadecimal)<n>3Input: 54 (Base: 11)<n>Output: 3A (converted to hex)<n>4Input: 50<n>Output:

You are correct in that you asked a question in an instruction. But that doesn't make your response part of the question. You need to ask more questions to get more results. A better response would be to look at the question and ask "What does the instruction say about the star? What does it say about the planets? Could "star" have more than four parts?"<n>```<n><n>### Input : The star had 4 rock planets and 4 gas planets orbiting it What was it part of Choice A: Hollywood B: Night Sky C: Constellation D: Aliens E: Solar System<n><n>### Response : The star was part of the solar system<n><n>## Challenge:<n>In this challenge, you describe a task and ask for a response that fulfills the request.<n>In this case, you explain a task where you are asked to help your grandfather by adding two gallons of gas to his car and clean up the yard. You can use the question mark (?).<n>The challenge will involve four stages. If you don't understand these, see [[1st Challenge - Overview]].<n><n>### Challenge Instructions<n>Here, when you were asked for your help with your grandfather, there wasn't a response that said which task you're being asked to perform. A good way to write a response then is to ask a "what" question. You can use the expression "___ ____"?_, replacing __ with a verb that would fit this situation. A verb is a word that describes an action. For example, you need to "help," "add," "add to," and so on. It's also important to avoid the word "that" as it can be confusing to some users.<n><n>### Challenge Demonstration<n>Given these instructions:<n><n>### Challenge:<n>Help Grandpa add two gallons of gas (?) to the car<n><n>Here is a good solution:<n><n>### Write something here<n><n>I have a question. I am supposed to be helping you get gas to your car. You asked me to bring gas to you, but you didn't give me a question where I could understand what you want me to do.

Where might he be staying? Choices:  A: farm B: town C: city D: hotel E: motel<n><n>### Response:		<n>Explanation: John is most likely staying in a motel.<n><n>Detailed Response:A motel is a type of lodging where visitors can rent a bed in private rooms. Motels tend to be more affordable than hotels—this is John’s main concern in this scenario. Motels are not typically rented by the night in some regions, but rather by the week, month, or season.<n><n>John is specifically looking for motels since he is trying to find a place to stay for less per night. Therefore, the other options—farm, town, and city—are not likely his best options as they are likely either expensive overnight fees or don't offer discounts or weekly rates.<n><n>Hotels are typically more expensive than motels, with a higher rate per night. Motels are slightly more likely to be found in a town or city, while hotels can be found in big cities and towns.<n>

In computer solitaire, an "easy" computer plays against you.<n>You're trying to arrange 36 cards which are numbered 1-36 on the left and 36 on the right, in an ordered fashion. The computer plays every card on the left. You don't get any points for cards on your side. However, if your side is orderly and the computer can't play any cards, then the computer moves on to your pile. If all cards on the right are gone before the computer moves to the pile, you have won the game!<n>The computer begins by moving the #1 card on the right to an unoccupied hole on the left side in an unordered fashion. This will always result in you receiving fewer points than if the card had been played correctly. Each time the computer has a choice of two options, it will choose the action which is more likely to lead to a "WIN NEXT MOVE", or WNM. How can you change the algorithm to make the computer play the optimal strategy, with WNM playing until it runs out of cards, then taking the winner?<n>Your algorithm must always play WNM until you are able to declare a winner. If the game cannot be won, your algorithm needs to play the game again until the computer wins.<n>Note: There are multiple cards (not yet played) that can yield a perfect solution; your algorithm needs to choose the card which will be the one played next.<n>### Response: the algorithm to make the  computer play the optimal strategy to choose<n><n>### Input :<n>The man wants to pick up a pumpkin from the pumpkin patch on the way to visit his grandparents at the nursing home.

Choices:  A: in cinema B: at the park C: martorell D: jeep E: airplane<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: in cinema<n><n>### Input:#. The store owner bought $49.25 worth of toilet paper. When he bought a new box of toilet paper, he paid $5.48 for each new box. The price of the previous box of toilet tissue was $6.89 per box. How many boxes did he buy?<n><n>### # Demonstration<n><n>Inputs:$49.25<n><n>The store owner bought the first box, which was the last box, since we know he must have bought at least two boxes, and therefore the price was not divisible by 4.925, so the new price must be divisible by 4 and a half, meaning that 5 must be the new box price. Since the store owner bought a new box, this means that the price of toilet paper increased, which means that when the owner bought the first box it cost less, so a previous box must have given him $49.27.<n><n>Input:$49.27<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>The store owner bought ten boxes initially because 49.27/6.89 = 7.24, which is not a whole number, so that means he must have bought a partial box, the price he paid for the partial box would be 49.20, which means he paid 49.25 minus 0.05 and if we continue this trend, the owner, on his second to last box, paid 54.80, which means the previous box cost 49.23, and this would go on for seven boxes until the owner bought the final box for 68.90.

The following code contains a series of lines of instructions.<n><n>2. The code is a fragment of a programming language.<n><n>3. A programming language is used by computer programmers to create software applications that are used on computers.<n><n>4. Computer programmers do not speak the code. They work with a syntax checker called an interpreter that translates programmers' directions into commands that the computer can understand and carry out.<n><n>5. Programmers create an instruction by assigning it a label, called a line number. A label precedes an instruction in the fragment and indicates where the instruction is to be placed in the computer program.<n><n>6. Programmers may want to repeat instructions in a program. If this is the case, each repetition of the instruction is called a loop.<n><n>7. In the image, a series of loops is created by the loop keyword. Each line of instructions within the loop is a piece of code.<n><n>7. The fragment contains program blocks. A program block contains a sequence of statements that are executed as a single logical unit.<n><n>7. A statement defines the sequence of individual jobs that are to be carried out by the computer.<n><n>7. One line in the fragment begins with the keyword end. This keyword marks the end of a program block and informs the interpreter that a new block is about to begin.<n><n>8. The instruction labeled line 7 sets the value of y to its square plus 1.<n><n>9. The statements within a program block are executed from top to bottom. In the block labeled 8-11 the code within the loop executes once for each iteration of the loop before it terminates.

Choices:  A: holding B: lift up C: pick up D: lifting E: hold onto<n><n>### Response:		If I were you, the first step would be to check the question, it seems to have been missing a question. That being said, the next step I would do is try to understand how do I know where my arm had to be in the air, the only information I got was that I had to have my arm extended.  It doesn't say extended in the arm, or to what point it should be extended, so I would decide if I knew that information, or not. I would first look at the options, A- E that are there. I would try to find anything that had to do with my arm extended. The options that stood out to me were C,D, and E. The first thing I look for in a question is the question keywords, and when I saw the word hold onto I then looked into the options. The only option that used that term was E, so that would lead me to believe maybe if I hold onto the object it will work. If I did that, then the second thing I would look for in the question would be clues. There were no clues as it were but the word extended, but I would look for other signals, or any hints that I might of missed the first time through. The second thing was the answer choices, I would look for any clues that matched up with the question, so if there was anything, I would try and incorporate that information.  I decided to hold it onto the object and guess that I had to have it extended upwards. When I lifted it upwards to extend my arm I was right.  <n><n>### Input :There were 213 students in the school, 211 of those students had their lunch brought in, and the other two students had sacks lunches. if you added the entire class how many students had the lunch?.<n><n>### Response :I would ask the teacher to repeat the question to make sure I understood, it seems obvious on my part the second part of the question should be after the first part, and not the only part. If that is the case, what type of information would I use to help answer this question? This question has me thinking about math, and the relationship of one to two.  I would start by looking at the first two words, then I would try to think logically about what I could possible think about to answer this question. The words lunch brought in, make me think about

The instructions tell us that all that the choices are within the house and he cannot have had a basement in the other house that he lives in because if he did, it would have been specified that he went to the basement in the new house instead of in the old one.<n><n>

Choices:  A: toy store B: story book C: great outdoors D: countryside E: wildlife refuge<n><n>### Response:		<n>My name is Amber and I am the mascot for the Giraffe store in California. I remember when I was really little, my owner told me a silly story about me working at the Giraffe store, when I was really a giraffe. I think it would be really fun to have a pet cow, I would bring it to the Giraffe store every day to help me learn better and work faster. When I get back from my job each night I could spend my time petting my cow, brushing my cow’s ears and making sure it is really clean. I think that cow’s are a great animal, especially when you have one of your own!<n><n>Giraffe’s come from the tallest family of them all, the _Animalia_ class. We are tall and skinny. The name giraffe comes from the Swahili word _zirafa_ which means “The one who moves quickly or silently!”. Our necks are pretty strong, I wish I could bend mine as well as all the other giraffe’s in the world! We are so long as our bodies and heads are combined that they can sometimes grow shorter than other animals, but never shorter than we are! We have a really powerful heart and can weigh up to 2000 pounds.<n><n>When I was at the store yesterday I saw a cool book on the shelf called 101 Facts About Giraffes by Katherine Kirkwood. It’s a lot easier and a lot more fun than learning about Giraffes from a book, I think we should take a walk over to the Giraffe refuge and see them all! My owner told me how to get there and I will show you the way!<n><n>We will drive on the highway 110, it only takes 89 minutes to get there and when you look at a map you can see that we are going on a direct route to the Giraffe Refuge. We will then stop at the Giraffe Museum for a good half hour and when we are done there we will go to the Refuge. After we visit all 6 of the different species of Giraffe there we will drive back to the store.<n><n>The museum will have lots of different Giraffe facts, one of my favorites is that there are over 100 different patterns in Giraffe spots in

Choices:  A: football stadium B: apartment C: surface of earth D: car show E: house<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### The answer is B : apartment<n><n>### Demostration:<n>1. How do we know?<n><n>    - The word "surface" in the question can either be referring to earth or any other solid material. But the answer given is "apartment" which is most unlikely to be one. Since the only thing that can be on the "surface" or the "top" of any solid material is anything with a wall i.e, house, apartment or any other structure. It is most likely that the question is talking about the "surface of earth".<n><n>2. What can we deduce from it?<n><n>    - "Almost all people" could refer to everyone in the earth or a majority of the population from a specific region. Since there is nothing that points us to specific location except that the question mentions "North Carolina", so we can infer that the question is talking only about the people from North Carolina and not the entire "almost all".<n><n>3. Is it reasonable?<n><n>    - This question can be answered based on the information given in the question.<n><n><n>

What's your answer?<n><n>### Dem: Write the code for 32+20=52<n><n>### Option 1:<n>```<n>for i in range(59):<n>	if i > 20:<n>		break;<n>	else:  <n>		i+=62;<n>```<n><n>#### Explaination:<n><n>When the counter is at even number, we have to go to the next step and increment(adding 1 to each number except that the number should not be added to the next step and the next step is 62 because we get 20 as the output<n><n>### Option2:<n>```<n>for x in range(38,59):<n>	x+=62;<n>	print(x)<n>```<n><n>### Explanations:<n><n>Starting with a=38. The next step is 38+=62. Then x=100. The next step is x+=62, then x=162 and we continue the same logic and increment the counter by adding 62 to it. If we get the number equal to the length of 59, we break.<n><n>### Option3:<n>```<n>x=0<n>for y in range(0,59):<n>            x+=y<n>        print('the total sum is',x)<n>````<n><n><n>### Explaination:<n>This logic is same as the first one. The only difference is we break the counter in 2 equal parts, at the beginning before the sum of both the parts are equal to the length of a total

Choices:  A: concert B: opera C: theater D: take class E: television<n><n>### Response:		<n>D<n><n>### Input 3: If you have not seen this movie or the sequel, you have not truly seen the trilogy.<n><n>### Response 2:<n>T (True).<n> <n>### Input 2: If you live in Colorado, you are most likely able to view a solar eclipse.<n><n>###Response 2:<n><n>F<n><n>In order to keep this solution as specific as possible, I am adding details to make it most succinct and understandable. These include:<n><n>This is actually two different questions, as the questions require different solutions.<n><n>To solve for the question, "How many blocks do Pete travel in all?" use this equation:<n>```<n> 5 blocks   == Pete walked from home   <n> 20 blocks  == he took a bus to the school<n> 50 blocks  == he went home<n>```<n><n>To solve for this question, I used this formula:<n>```<n> 10 blue chaiers == There are 5 times as many blue chairs as white chairs. <n> 13 fewer white chaers ==  The green chairs are twice as many as the blue chaiers plus there are 13 white chaers<n> 14 chaiers < total num of chaiers == 14 is not more than 10 + 13<n> 13 = total number of white chaers = + 14<n> 25 = total number of blue chaers = + 5<n> 68 = total num of chaiere <n>```<n><n>This is a very specific question.  We can solve by using the formula `5 times the number of blue chairs = 20`.  The following:<n><n>- 10 blue chiels  <n>- 10 + <n>- 16 blue chiels  <n><n>All three are the same.<n><n>`For every 2 jackets, Annika, she gets 1  free jacket.`<n><n>`For every  3 t-shirters, she gets 1`<n><n>Therefore 4x(1/1.75)=35/3 = 12. 10x(1/0.75) = 12.5 12+12.5 = 24.5.<n><n>Therefore 14+9

Below is the code on the first 7 lines<n>```<n>var readInt = (function(){<n>  var scan = /^\s*(\-)?(?:\d+|\d{1,3}([\.]\d+)?)(?:\s*(e|E)?\s*(\-)?(\d+|\d{4}))?/),<n>      scanErr = function(){<n>        throw new RangeError("scan took NaN - input must be an integer");<n>      };<n><n>  return function(val, radix){<n>    if (!typeof val === "string") throw new TypeError("val is not a string");

Her eyes fell on a store, where there was a poster saying 'Beauty is in the eye of the beholder'.**<n><n>**She stood staring at the poster for a whole minute and went inside to purchase a lipstick.

It was addressed to "all beautiful girls" and read "be beautiful and stay beautiful". It came as a shocker to her. This simple card became a milestone in the life of the beautiful lady.**<n><n>**Through that poster, she came to know that her parents were wrong all these days. Her parents had always made her feel like she was not good looking and that had made her feel bad about herself. She always considered herself to be ugly. This was all because in their eyes, she was not beautiful. <n>**But all this was because that day she became aware of how beautiful she was in the eyes of a stranger.

All thanks to that poster. Everyone is beautiful, just as they are.**<n>

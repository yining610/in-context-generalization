If, for example, you were asked to convert a 12 (base 10) to a 6 (base 2), your algorithm would need to get the first set of 3 numbers and know what base you are converting from to use. In this algorithm, the input number that you use to determine your new digits is your base. This is called the modulus. Write your program to take a number, determine your new base, and display the number in that base.\nYour algorithm should take the number as input from the user.\nUse the modulus. The modulus is a method for extracting a number from a larger number. The modulus will give you the first set of digits, or your new base.\nYour method will take two inputs, x and y. The x represents your current base.\nThe y will be the modulus.\nThen you will take that modulus and figure out the remainder. You determine the remainder based on if it is greater than or less than ten.\nIf it is less than ten, you take that remainder x+1. If it is greater than ten, you subtract ten from to it then add one. Then you put it back as a string.\nIf the remainder is 0, you multiply the modulus by the number that is remaining. In this case, y x 0.\n\nYour output is a string of digits that are the representation of the original number in your new base.\n\n### Sample Inputs and Output:\n1Input: 14; Input base: 10\nOutput: 14 (converted to binary)\n2Input: 12 (Base: 10)\nOutput: 4 (converted to hexadecimal)\n3Input: 54 (Base: 11)\nOutput: 3A (converted to hex)\n4Input: 50\nOutput:", "answer": "C: city"}

A good way to write a response then is to ask a \"what\" question. You can use the expression \"___ ____\"?_, replacing __ with a verb that would fit this situation. A verb is a word that describes an action. For example, you need to \"help,\" \"add,\" \"add to,\" and so on. It's also important to avoid the word \"that\" as it can be confusing to some users.\n\n### Challenge Demonstration\nGiven these instructions:\n\n### Challenge:\nHelp Grandpa add two gallons of gas (?) to the car\n\nHere is a good solution:\n\n### Write something here\n\nI have a question.

In computer solitaire, an \"easy\" computer plays against you.\nYou're trying to arrange 36 cards which are numbered 1-36 on the left and 36 on the right, in an ordered fashion. The computer plays every card on the left. You don't get any points for cards on your side. However, if your side is orderly and the computer can't play any cards, then the computer moves on to your pile. If all cards on the right are gone before the computer moves to the pile, you have won the game!\nThe computer begins by moving the #1 card on the right to an unoccupied hole on the left side in an unordered fashion.

The price of the previous box of toilet tissue was $6.89 per box. How many boxes did he buy?\n\n### # Demonstration\n\nInputs:$49.25\n\nThe store owner bought the first box, which was the last box, since we know he must have bought at least two boxes, and therefore the price was not divisible by 4.925, so the new price must be divisible by 4 and a half, meaning that 5 must be the new box price. Since the store owner bought a new box, this means that the price of toilet paper increased, which means that when the owner bought the first box it cost less, so a previous box must have given him $49.27.\n\nInput:$49.27\n\n#### Explanation:\nThe store owner bought ten boxes initially because 49.27/6.89 = 7.24, which is not a whole number, so that means he must have bought a partial box, the price he paid for the partial box would be 49.20, which means he paid 49.25 minus 0.05 and if we continue this trend, the owner, on his second to last box, paid 54.80, which means the previous box cost 49.23, and this would go on for seven boxes until the owner bought the final box for 68.90.", "answer": "A: in cinema"}

Each line of instructions within the loop is a piece of code.\n\n7. The fragment contains program blocks.

It doesn't say extended in the arm, or to what point it should be extended, so I would decide if I knew that information, or not. I would first look at the options, A- E that are there.

When I get back from my job each night I could spend my time petting my cow, brushing my cow\u2019s ears and making sure it is really clean. I think that cow\u2019s are a great animal, especially when you have one of your own!\n\nGiraffe\u2019s come from the tallest family of them all, the _Animalia_ class. We are tall and skinny.

Our necks are pretty strong, I wish I could bend mine as well as all the other giraffe\u2019s in the world!

We have a really powerful heart and can weigh up to 2000 pounds.\n\nWhen I was at the store yesterday I saw a cool book on the shelf called 101 Facts About Giraffes by Katherine Kirkwood. It\u2019s a lot easier and a lot more fun than learning about Giraffes from a book, I think we should take a walk over to the Giraffe refuge and see them all! My owner told me how to get there and I will show you the way!\n\nWe will drive on the highway 110, it only takes 89 minutes to get there and when you look at a map you can see that we are going on a direct route to the Giraffe Refuge. We will then stop at the Giraffe Museum for a good half hour and when we are done there we will go to the Refuge. After we visit all 6 of the different species of Giraffe there we will drive back to the store.\n\nThe museum will have lots of different Giraffe facts, one of my favorites is that there are over 100 different patterns in Giraffe spots in", "answer": "A: toy store"}

These include:\n\nThis is actually two different questions, as the questions require different solutions.\n\nTo solve for the question, \"How many blocks do Pete travel in all?\" use this equation:\n```\n 5 blocks   == Pete walked from home   \n 20 blocks  == he took a bus to the school\n 50 blocks  == he went home\n```\n\nTo solve for this question, I used this formula:\n```\n 10 blue chaiers == There are 5 times as many blue chairs as white chairs. \n 13 fewer white chaers ==  The green chairs are twice as many as the blue chaiers plus there are 13 white chaers\n 14 chaiers < total num of chaiers == 14 is not more than 10 + 13\n 13 = total number of white chaers = + 14\n 25 = total number of blue chaers = + 5\n 68 = total num of chaiere \n```\n\nThis is a very specific question.  We can solve by using the formula `5 times the number of blue chairs = 20`.  The following:\n\n- 10 blue chiels  \n- 10 + \n- 16 blue chiels  \n\nAll three are the same.\n\n`For every 2 jackets, Annika, she gets 1  free jacket.`\n\n`For every  3 t-shirters, she gets 1`\n\nTherefore 4x(1/1.75)=35/3 = 12. 10x(1/0.75) = 12.5 12+12.5 = 24.5.\n\nTherefore 14+9", "answer": "B: opera"}

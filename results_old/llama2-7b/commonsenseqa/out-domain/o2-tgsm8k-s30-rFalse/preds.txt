"We can't possibly tackle it all in a day." The school principal and the janitor looked at the janitor's list.  The list included cleaning the bathrooms, cleaning the showers, replenishing the toilet paper, washing the floors in the foyer, and dusting the furniture and fixtures, among other tasks.  The janitor estimated that it would take eight hours to do three of these tasks, and 12 hours to do six.  Which job would take longer?<n><n>Answer:<n>There are 14 bathrooms altogether, 6 showers, 9 other bathrooms including sinks and water pumps, 23 sinks, 5 toilets, 100 towels and 100 other towels. 100 towel and 18 water supplies.  So the total number of towels is 288.  The janitor will need 3600 minutes which can be found using the following formula:<n><n>The total towels that will be needed:<n>Cleaner toilets:<n>100+100+288=588<n>Clean towels:<n>1000/200+18=4,880<n>Water for towels:<n>23+14=37<n>588=21.6<n>4,880=20.<n>37=0.012<n>So if you multiply.12 (one twelfth) for each of the towels that's 1.56.  And when you add that all up, that's 12 hours for the job.  So the job that will take longer is the job that counts the towels.  The job that will take longer, so it will take the janitor longer to complete the task.<n><n><n><n>### Instructions: <n><n>The janitor wanted to know how many towels there were per toilet.

We also have the step -by- step solution for this problem. We created the same steps that was followed by the book. We followed the logical rules for algebra step by step. The solution method that we used can be called as solid method for this particular problem.<n><n>## Solutions<n>We made two solutions: One with explanation and the other with steps.<n><n>### Solution 1 - explanation<n>The first thing that we did we asked ourselves a question like how much, in dollars, does Jennie pay for the car rental? What we did instead of using the question mark (?), you have to write the answer that you want to explain. The answer to the question is **310.** The car-rental charges $30 per day. The renting period for Jennie is for 11 days then she rented the car for 11 (1 day = 24 hours) hours so in $30, she will pay $330 (30 $x11 (hours). But we take the 11 days from the hours. So the final answer is 310 dollars (330/(11)). That is why the answer is 31 dollars.<n><n>**Output:** 310<n>**Answer:** The car-rent charge is $30 for 1 day. Jenny rented for 11 days and 11 days is more than a week. The car-rental charged for a long period of time from $1

Write a response that properly completes the task.<n><n>### Input/Output:<n>A programmer has written a small database management system to maintain track of his customers.  For each customer, the system will store a unique customer ID, the name, the customer's most recent transaction date, the amount spent at that time, and the customer's total of all purchases.  In this system, a customer ID is a unique, positive integer.<n><n>Now, using an appropriate data structure, describe the steps that the programmer must take to store and retrieve data from the database for Customer X with id 1.<n>Include specific steps and the amount of space, in characters, each step uses.<n><n>### Output: <n>The input for step 5 must be obtained by calling the function `showCustomers();` which will give you a list of all customers. Then sort that list and find the customer with id=1. There are two ways to do this and I prefer the second because it requires less memory.<n>In O(1) operations we find the id of our customer and store a pointer to the first character in that field. We then retrieve the input file and then print the input line, starting the first character in the line, and following all occurrences of characters in the input.  There are 3 methods to do this.  The first method would be the most efficient as each iteration of the for loop access only one char from the buffer.  It takes O(N) where N is the number of characters in the file.<n><n>### Solution:<n>Below is an input/output statement that describes a problem. Write a response that<n>properly completes the task.

And there was a couple of reasons why the teacher might call a meeting. One example was, if they weren't sure where their grads was because they haven’t been to class and the teacher didn’t know where they were. Another example of why they might call would be if a student is struggling they might ask the parents and guardians if they can help with it. And when I started working, I realized that in high schools they will try to give as many opportunities to the students to attend college or some post-secondary. Schools will also give out scholarships to those who qualify. And to further their education they will have programs after high school. And when I first started working, I didn’t know all this. So I think that’s one of the reasons why teachers call parents.<n><n>## Question:<n>Give me feedback on my paragraph.<n><n>### Feedback:<n>Hi, there are a few things that you need to do with you paragraph.

Your program must read in the population and name of the town as a string, process them, and display the information of the town in the format of population.<n><n>### Hints:<n>Your program should use both an integer variable and a string variable to hold the population and town names, respectively.  To print the town and the population of it to standard out, either use printf or write a "floating point" formatting string that is followed by a %s followed by the string variable, a percentage followed by the percent sign, and then an integer followed by either the percent sign or the decimal point, depending on what is expected.  So, for the integer, the format is "%10d", and for the float, the format is "%0.2f". You have to use the "%d" (integer), "%f" (floating), and "%s" (string) format specifiers to write formatted output.  When using printf, you must include the % and it automatically ends the format pattern; you must then include a percent sign in your parameter.<n><n>### Solution:<n>```<n>#include <iostream><n><n>using namespace std;<n><n>int main()<n>{<n>int population;<n>string town;<n>}<n><n>cout << "Enter the name of the town followed by its population in the line below in this standard format: <Town> <population>" << endl;<n>getline(cin, town);<n>cin >> population;<n>cout <<"  <population>" << town << endl;<n>}<n>```<n><n>## Required Resources<n>To complete this task, you will need<n>* the `C++` language specification<n>* the `C` language specification<n><n>* the `CppPrimer_5thEdition` (5th edition C++ Primer book)<n><n>* the [CppCon 30 minute session on language changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTcKxM-LVnE) is highly recommended. <n>* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/C/) (a tutorial site)<n><n><n>

After all, he can't afford for them to get wet;  after all, he might need to eat one of them later in the season.  As they are traveling, one of the cows produces a calf... How much, in dollars is the cow worth, assuming she was producing at the rate of 40 milk a day, and milk sells for $2/gallon?<n><n>### Instructions<n>Input: It is spring, and a farmer plants 5700 oak seeds.  She only plants one kind of tree.  Of these seeds, 40% fail to germinate, and of the surviving plants only 50% survive long enough to bear fruit.  The farmer's tree farm is in a region with a lot of storms.  Of the trees that do not die during a storm, only 30% survive for 16 years. The farmer intends to sell any produce she may have when enough mature trees are in the grove to sustain her income after the seeds are gone.  How many trees, then, will she, on average, produce the first year?<n><n>### Demographics<n>Input: It is time for the 37th Annual Bee Festival... but this year is different from any other year that the festival has been around...

Each person pays $1,400/year to be a member of the club and is allowed two round trip flights per month. Members are permitted to bring along three guests for each flight. In the southwestern United States, a typical round trip fare costs about $195. Write a program that,when given the name of an airport, can determine how much money a person who was a member of the airplane club would need to fly to an alternative airport and bring back two guests. Assign each member a positive number indicating their monthly redeemable flights for the year. Your airport names will start with the letter A (e.g. "abq"). Your input will consist of a single word specifying the name of an air travel-based facility, followed by two numbers (one positive). Your output will be two numbers: one will be $0 for the member to cover his or her two redeemable flits and one number that indicates the amount of money the member would need to cover an alternate airport and bring two passengers back (which you will have to compute from your airport cost and your current redeemable flis allowance).

If and else statement is one of several control structures available in almost all programming languages. Conditions can be either true or false, if the condition is true then we execute the statement else do nothing.<n><n>  When we use while statement we are putting it on loop. While statement has two things. condition and block.<n>  let us try an example like while we run  the while loop 10 times(condition).<n>        <n>while(condition) {<n>	//block of code(to be executed)<n>	codeBlock1();<n>	codeBlock2();<n>	codeBlock3();<n>};<n><n>1.Condition checks a condition<n>2.In while,if(condition) block is executed <n>3.Block is nothing but code that you code to execute.<n><n><n>  `if...else` has three thing, condition that checks and is true or false, then `if`block or `then` block and else block. In `if...else` we run if block the first time and run else block when `if` block is false or you just run else block when no statement is inside `if` block.<n>        <n>if (statement) {<n>	// block to run when condition is true<n>	code;<n>}else{<n>	//block to run when condition is false<n>	code;<n>};<n>

But the idea to use prompts to practice programming skills came from [Margaret Sweatman's](https://github.com/margaretsweatman/programming-exercises).   I've used her prompts in the past.

Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<n>Answer: 40<n><n>### Input:Blood isn't usually spilled during what sport that doesn't allow the use of hands? Choices:  A: soccer game B: capillaries C: ball D: animals E: person<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is:  C. Capillary <n>The explanation is:  The capillary can't be spilled of blood because human's cannot fight animals.<n><n>### Input<n><n>- I need help finding a book with this ISBN<n>- 0-321-71636-7<n><n><n>### Response <n>The book you're looking for is [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C# by Mark L. A. (Johnson)]<n><n>### Input <n>In what type of animal will a wolf find its next meal?<n><n>### Response<n>The correct answer is D. Person.<n>Because wolves are not domesticated animals. <n><n>### Inputs:<n>It's possible to find the next prime number by just looking at the last two digits, but the technique won't work for numbers greater than one million.<n>### Response<n><n>#### It's possible to find prime numbers in this fashion. <n>Since it is impossible to find the next prime numbers from one million greater than one million. This implies it has worked for any numbers greater than one million because they are more than one million.<n><n>### It's possible to divide a number by the sum of all the digits of the number and then divide the result by that number, and each resulting in a single digit. The sum of the digits is the largest possible value for this single digit. (In the 123 456 789 example, the largest possible value of a digit is 9).<n>### Response<n>#### It is impossible to do this with larger numbers <n>By dividing any large numbers, we can only get 10 as the largest value possible because that is the limit for numbers.<n><n>### If the oddity of the original number is odd, then the next odd number is equal to the original number doubled.<n>### Response.<n>#### It is not possible to double any numbers, we can only double 1,2,3,4...10<n>by adding the number 10 to one another to get a bigger number.<n><n>### Output <n><n>#### The next integer is 5  because we doubled the number, and then we added one more to end up with the next integer that we can double again in order to go to the next one.

When the company sells a pizza the sales grow for awhile and after that the sales begin to go down. That’s a positive aspect because it means that the sales is growing, but when it stops growing it goes down, that means that the sales are not growing as well as they were. <n><n>**Negative:** I believe that in the negative aspect the sales grows more quickly but it does not grow as fast as it did when it was growing. That means that the sales are slowing down and the company will be able to sell more pizza’s in the long run and have lower sales than they did in the beginning.<n><n>**Why does the data point show a positive relationship?** The point shows a positive relationship because both the graph is increasing and it is showing a downward slope for both graphs.<n><n>**Why dose the data point show a negative relationship?** It shows a negative relationship because if you look at the graph it is decreasing.<n><n>**Does the correlation between Pizza Sales and the Month shown in the data point make a difference?** The correlation does not make a difference because it is still the same downward slope.<n><n><n>### Instuctiuion:<n>**

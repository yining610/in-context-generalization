Similarly, the result when k = 2, 3, 4, and 5 is different from each other.<n><n>### Response :<n>1. m &lt; n &gt; k for k = 1.

For some of these values of k, the output is 8 &#61; k &lt; n &lt; 8, which is the same as k = 1. For other values of k, the answer is 8 - (k &#61; n), which is the sum of all values in the original set.<n>> For m = 6 and n = 8, k = 1 would make the output 0 (because there's only 1 item in the original set), while k = 5 would make the output 8 (because 5 is in the original set), making the output not the sum of all values of the original set.<n>3. 8 &#6364; k &#6167; 8 &#6228; k (n) &#6368; 8 (k + n).

Make 8 random selections from the alphabet letters from A to E in no particular order.  Then put them in no particular order except for the letters C, D and E.  <n>Example:  <n>A, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, and B are the order chosen.  <n>2. Get all of the letters in the alphabet besides the letters C, D, and E.  <n>This gives you a list of all the letters except for the four randomly chosen letters that are included in the first step.  <n>In the case of our example:  <n>"ABFGHJK", which leaves us with letters A, F, G, and J.  <n>3. For all letters, pick a random number from 1 to 9.  <n>"A" = 4  <n>"F" = 6  <n>"G" = 4   <n>"J" = 3  <n>4. Combine the letters and the random number to create a new string.  <n>"AD", "EJ", "GF"  <n>5. Check if the letters are in the alphabet.  <n>"AD" = true  <n>"EJ" = true  <n>  "GF" = false  <n>6. Check if the letters start with A to E.  <n>"AD = false  <n>"EJ = true  \<n>"GF = false  \<n><n>7. If the letters that are in the alphabet and in the order A, B, C, D, and/or E are in the same string, check if that string equals the result of putting in a set of 8 random letters in an alphabetically ordered way except for two letters and one more letter.  <n>In the example above:  <n>7. "AD". AD = "AD". True  <n>"EJ". EJ = "EJ". True  <n>"GF". GF = "EJ". False<n><n>8.

The student chose D and wrote Fill them up. The verb fill is correct but there needs to be a ‘them’ which is not stated in the solution. This is an example of how a student who has mastered the skill of reading for key-words could get the answer correct, but a student who had to decode every word needs additional practice of the skill to improve this level of reading.<n><n>The solution given ‘They are full, so we had to put some more gas, in order to fill them. Up’ is grammatically incorrect in structure and has numerous spelling errors.<n><n>To improve on their errors in spelling and structure, this student would need to practice making correct sentences. To do this effectively they need first to recognize the errors made and then be given feedback on those errors.<n><n>To help them better recognize the errors they made, you could draw attention to the errors made and why they are errors by providing a rubric or criteria with feedback, in the future. Then the errors may jump out at them.<n><n>## Instinct:Answers the following multiple-choice questions.<n><n>## InstuctioN:Answer the question below with choices a,b,c, and d.

Write a response that appropriatly addresses the task.<n>  <n>### Input:<n>Tom drives his truck out into the parking lot as he always does.  He likes to get out there a little early so that he has enough time to find a good place to park. He spots the last good open space about halfway down the parking lot and drives toward the front of the building to the passenger drop off point.  As he is walking toward the door, he sees that he has an invoice for payment from the vendor that had delivered some parts that he has not gotten around to ordering for his new project. He picks up the invoice and is just about to turn to the front when he sees a few more people coming out of the building to the sidewalk.  They are coming out a different exit than where he is going so he decides he can make it to the front before he has to pull out again.  He gets inside and has just enough time to say hi to the admin assistant before finding the stairs to get to the second floor where his office is.  He notices a few stray people on the floor heading toward his door and makes a mental note to let them in.  Just then a few people he knows walk in but before he can get to his door there is a group of people at the stairs.  It is getting later in the day so not sure where they came from since they did not work on this floor.  He stands in the door and waits patiently for them to figure out how to get up to the second floor.  One by one they notice the up arrow sign and begin to slowly move toward the stairs.  As they gather on each flight Tom is in their way so he steps up to the top and waits.  He then takes the time to glance at the invoice and sees the parts that he had ordered and was expecting to get as well as a reminder that he should take delivery of them sometime in the next couple weeks.  As he is working up the invoice for the third part of the day, the last guy in line finally gets to the stairs and takes one step up.<n><n>### Outputs:<n><n>### Demmisonet:<n>

We’ll get the instructions from any of the input sources we can find, and we’ll break down the instruction into multiple comprehensible clauses.<n><n>We can use [this](https://thecodingmachine.com/posts/coding-jobs-interviews/coding-tips/how-to-read-and-understand-any-coding-problem/) article by TheCodingMachine to know how to read complex, text-based programming instructions by breaking them down into multiple comprehensible sub components.<n><n>The second technique to be concerned with is the _breaking-down of instructions into a program sequence_. Our steps might be simple, but it might get difficult at times to understand which step in the sequence comes first and which comes last—we could use [this](https//thecodingmachine.co/posts/codinginterview/coding-tipsi-step-bystep/how-to-break-down-coding-problem) article to demystify this step.<n><n>The third technique to be concerned with, at least for some of the coding tasks we’ll see, is the use of [combinations](https://thecoderpad.com/blog/2015/12/30/27-computer-science-problems-explained/) to solve a task. Using combinations to solve a task works when there is a need to solve the task in different ways, each with its own logic and algorithm.<n>

You provided details and supporting data. The choice 'A: walk', is not related to boredom, because boring is an adjective describing a feeling, and a subject performing the action. This choice can be removed or left blank without affecting the problem. The choice 'D: smell smoke' is the most straightforward and it captures your insight that children act out. The other choice answers are too vague. For instance, if a child 'changes shoes', what is she thinking about?  I think it's funny to see it stated like this, but it seems that 'walk to get bored' might be more related to the choice than 'change shoes'.<n><n>### Follow-up: You made 1 grammatical errors. Correct 5 of the errors and provide explanations for what was incorrect. Examples: The dog is at the park (incorrect: use a singular verb; the dog is running across the park; The dog is running across the field; The dog is going to the park; The dog and its tail are in the park)<n><n>### Response<n>1.) The dog is at the Park The dog is at the dog park The dog is running around the dog park The dog was at the dog park before it ran around The dog is sleeping at the dog park<n>2.)

Lack of solutions may help if a company or organization has a problem, but not for an individual.<n><n>### Dedication must be earned, so it's not required for a great person.

Choices:  A: friendship B: aggression C: defeat D: winning or losing E: sweat<n><n>### Response:		Explanation: A.Friendship.  I have gone through all the options and it does not take away the word from meaning "friendship.  The last statement also states that this is how they work.  This is not really a competing of defeating or winning.  It is competing to work against one another.  It is competitive and is a little bit of a friendly competition.  Competitive competition and friendly competition can only come from one place, a place of friendship.<n><n>### Validate your response: I looked through options B - D and I do not see it meaning "friendship".  B stands for aggression.  C stands for defeat and E stands for sweat. The context of the statement does not allow for any of them to work.  I can even see that D and E are directly to the point of the statement "competitive competition and friendly competition".  It does not support that the answer to the question is E.<n>

A is close, but since regular is more expensive, we will spend more of our budget on it and less of it on premium.  ([3]. B is correct because we use the gas prices from the first demonstration.  [4]. B is correct because the two tanks are of different size, 9 gallon regular vs 12 gallon premium. You can also do this:  If he bought 3 regular and premium and spent $10, the costs for each gallon would be $3.33.  If he bought 12 premium and 9 regular then the costs for each gallion would be $3.63.  $10/3.33 is the cheaper cost per gallon, $10/3 is the more expensive cost per gallon.

Choices:  A: good health B: heart attacks C: relaxation D: rest E: fatigue<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Instructions:Analyze what was written and determine the best course of action.<n><n>### Inference:If Adam spent 24 hours a day sleeping when young, can you figure out what he does to stay awake now?<n><n>### Input-Inferences:Sleep is the unconscious state of a person, animal, and of some plants. In contrast to non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), which is the other sleep stage, rem sleep is distinctive in having a highly organized, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep cycle. The sequence of REM and NREM states repeat in a cycle approximately every 90–100 minutes throughout the night, and many of the cycles are lost at the end of the night after the person wakes up and must be consciously repeated the following morning.<n><n>In rem sleep, the sleeper is usually in a dream state that involves visual imagery and emotions along with the paralysis that prevents the sleeper from acting out their dream. Although the specific function of dreaming and rapid eye movement remains to be determined, the theory that the function of rem sleep is to integrate and help consolidate information from waking-life, and that the dream state is merely to be expected during this, has been well-validated.<n><n>However, a controversial hypothesis, the sleep-driven-thought theory, suggests rem sleep (and dreaming in particular) helps store recently created memories and maintains their integrity; this is achieved by a process of integrating related material from the cerebral cortex to ensure consistency of interpretation, in a phenomenon known as memory consolidation. A great deal of scientific evidence supports this hypothesis while other theories, such as the hippocampal consolidation theory, have been proposed. Further research is needed to distinguish how rem sleep specifically contributes to memory consolidation.<n><n>### Inputs-Response:If Adam spent 13% of his waking hours sleeping when young, do the following.<n><n>### Response 1:Adam went to sleep less during the day.<n><n>### Solution:Adam got a lot less sleep last night than when he was young because he's now a student.<n><n>### Question 2:Which of the following statements regarding healthy weight is (are) true?<n>

Choices:  A: geography B: history studies C: math D: religion E: dancing<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Option A:<n>The answer is "A: Geography". This is because traditional science involves disciplines like physics and chemistry whereas social science involves disciplines like sociology and business. If you've heard of geography before, it's because it's one of the social sciences. This is unlike geography and dancing which are unrelated subjects.<n><n>### Option B:<n>The answer is B: History Studies.  If someone said "his favorite subject was science," that is not saying that it was the student's favorite subject, but rather it's about the discipline of science as a whole, and science students have many disciplines to choose from.  It's the science as a whole that the student would like.  The same goes for when he says he's not great at science, it is not about being a bad student, but rather that he has had many subjects to choose from when it comes to science.<n><n>### Answer:<n>The answer is C: Math<n><n><n>### Option C:<n>The answer is Math. This is because traditional science includes things like physics and astronomy.

Choices:  A: movies B: opera C: theater D: lecture hall E: hockey game<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>> E<n><n>### Explain:<n><n>> The lecture hall will have fixed numbers of rows which makes it easier to measure the number of seats, whereas the other categories have the flexibility to have multiple rows and the seats will be variable. If it is a hockey game that means there would be many seats, whereas for theater, the number of seats is likely to be less. The bleachers are present in the movie halls, so this option does not seem like a probable choice. The opera has the same seating arrangement as the theater, so that option cannot be the right one either. This leaves us with the most likely option which is the hockey game.<n><n>

Choices:  A: ignore B: write C: learn new things D: illiterate E: having fun<n><n>### Response:		C<n>### Instruction<n>You'll be given a set of strings. Some of these strings are complete, and other strings are partial and have gaps. You'll be asked to fill in the missing characters so that you can produce the longest possible string that you can.<n>For example, you may be given the input string `aa` and asked to complete it. There are a lot of possible answers here, like `aaa`, `aaaa`, and `aaaaa`. However, you only want to produce the longest string if you can, so try and output `aaaaa` or `aaaaaa`.<n><n>#### Description:<n><n>Inputs: A string with any number of characters that is missing letters.<n>Example Input: `ba`<n>Example Output: `baa`<n><n>### Solution<n><n>#### Step 1: Make A List Of All The Possible Endpoints<n>We can make a list and a list of length 0, using the indexer list[]. The list represents all possible endpoints for possible strings that we can make, that are not already in the list. So list[i:j] means what possible strings can we make out of the string, which start from index 0 to start index i - 1? For the string we can make with index 0, there can only be one possible endpoint, index 0. We can start index i - 3, for index [i-3:i-1], there are two options: index i - 2 or index i - 1.<n><n>#### Step 2: Check if every possible string with a possible endpoint is already in the list.<n>Once we have a list of all possible endpoints, we can write a function to check if a specific index is in the list of all possible endpoint or not. Note that this is not the index of the character, if it is there, the corresponding character would already be there. If a character's index is there, then the character would not be in the list.<n><n>#### Step3: Go through the list and check if we have every possible string. If we have it, add it to the list. Otherwise we can output.<n>Once we have the list, we can check if every possible string is present. This is so we don't produce strings that are already there. If we have every possible string, then put that into the list. If not, output the new strings that we have

The president will be speaking for 170 minutes in total in the week.<n><n>### Challenge<n>Sally took her medicine as the doctor instructed.

Choices:  A: box B: home C: alley D: lap E: barn<n><n>### Response:		A, B, C, E<n><n>### Demand:<n>A cat needs a place of its own where it can sleep well. A lap can only be given to the cat for little time. Barns are usually dirty.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>A box is a personal space that the cat can use in its own way. A home is a more private space than a lap. An alley is more of being with animals than being held in someone's lap.<n><n>1. The cat needs to find a place to nap that will give them the rest they need and deserve. A home would provide this.<n>2. The cat needs a place to rest when their owner isn't giving them lap time. The owner's lap would be the preferred time for the cat to rest.<n>3. Resting in between activities to regain energy. In an alley, cats would get some exercise from the other animals around them. Cats usually sleep better when they can't see.<n>4. A lap is a temporary spot the cat gets when it's being cradled. The cat can't be sure it is safe or comfortable. A box should be its spot so its personal items are safe.<n>5. Cats are used to hiding behind boxes so they can avoid danger.

She would surely prefer an option that would be comfortable and safe.<n><n>1. Shoes that don't fit could be dangerous and painful to the dog, possibly causing injury.  A dog wouldn't be happy in that case.<n><n>2. Shoes that could fall off easily can cause the dog pain if it gets stepped on and gets hurt by the dog or people.<n>

Choices:  A: stress B: food C: that you D: spending money E: walking<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>You need to have 100% accuracy on this. The answer will be (D) <n><n>The stress response is an adaptive response by the body when exposed to stress. <n>It occurs when the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) releases the hormones epinephrine (adrenaline), <n>norepinephrine, and dopamine into body tissues, muscles, and organs to ready the body's systems. <n>Epinephrine and related hormones increase heart rate and force of heartbeat. They dilate small arteries in skeletal muscles, <n>making it easier to move and speeding up reaction time. Hormones constrict veins to reduce blood flow out of tissues, <n>making more blood available for muscle use. The digestive and reproductive systems are suppressed. <n>Breast secretions become stimulated, as the milk-producing alveoli in the breast become dilated. <n>Sex drive is reduced (less interest in sexual activity) due to falling levels of the sex hormone testosterone. <n>Lactation, however, is also increased, <n>as prolactin, the stimulant for lactation, is also released. Dopamine, acetylcholine, and substance-P, <n>all transmitter molecules, increase. More acetylcholine stimulates muscle contractions. Dopamine increases heart rate and affects muscle control. <n>Acetylcholine, which transmits impulses from the peripheral (outside the brain and spinal cord) and autonomic (involuntary) nervous system <n>and from the endocrine system, acts both in and outside the central nervous system. <n>All these mechanisms aid in the preparation of the body for fight or flight. Elevated epinephrine and norepinephrine <n>are associated with heightened alertness and arousal.<n><n>### Question:<n><n>What is the primary function of the Stress Response?<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>Reaction Time (R.T.) is the time elapsed between a stimulus being presented to a person and the person's response to the stimulus. <n>By comparing a subject's reaction time

Each European country has at least one city, except for Malta. Austria is the smallest country with its largest city being Vienna. What is the total number of cities in Austria.<n><n>### Response<n><n>You could write answers like this:<n><n>If Austria has at least one city which is Vienna, then the answer is 1. If it has more than one city, the answer must not be 327. Thus the answer is 1, which is 100% correct.<n><n>If the answer is 2, that is the best answer. You can prove that if 2 people in Austria share the city then each of the countries surrounding Austria have 168 cities minus 2 cities shared because there are also two cities that are shared. Thus, the only other answer of 327 is wrong because it does not take into consideration that the countries surrounding Austria have cities, too.<n><n>Input: How many cups does 10 lbs of sugar weigh?<n><n>Response:<n><n>You could answer this question like this:<n><n>Since there are 20 cups in 10 lbs., the answer is 2.0.<n><n>or<n><n>Since there are roughly 500 grams in 20 cups, and 202.7468 grams in 10 lbm, we end up with an answer of 2.33948349 lb.<n>

Choices:  A: tree tops B: rain forest C: zoological gardens D: great outdoors E: zoo<n><n>### Response:		Answer E<n><n>### Demo:<n>If we wanted to find the monkey in the rainforest (and that's our task), we would need to know that the question is about the rainforest. To find this out, we would read the question, which mentions a monkey. This monkey is the one that the question is concerned with. We also find out more information about the monkey - it's in the rainforest. It's here in the rainforest that we will find it. That is, the monkey is likely to be found 'in the rainforest'. To find out other information about the monkey, we need to read beyond the question, as it has nothing more to say about the monkey.<n><n>### Input 2:There are two shelves in a library: shelf A and shelf B. A total of 400 books are on the shelves of A and B. Choices:  A) shelf A has more books B) shelf B has more books C) shelf A has as many books as shelf B D) shelf B has as many books as any other shelf in a library E) books are always balanced<n><n>### Response 2:<n>Answer:E<n><n>### Demo 2.0:<n>If there were 5 shelves with a total of 50 books, they must add up to 50, or one book for each shelf. If there were 10 shelves with a 100 books, 20 books, or 10 for each shelf, we would get 100 books. Hence books don't need to be distributed exactly equally, they just need to be distributed somewhere close - the answer is E.<n><n>### Note: This challenge is about understanding a question and answering an appropriate question.

What does this mean?<n><n>### Response:"It means that, at this level of output, consumers are demanding the same number of computers as the company is supplying."<n><n>### Supply: The supply curve is downward sloping. What does this mean<n><n>### Response"It means that, as the production of computers rises, the cost of production falls. Thus, there is more economic incentive for companies to turn on another production machine. The companies, in other words, can increase the supply of computers more easily as the quantity of computers produced increases."<n><n>### Law/Laws Of Supply/Demand:<n>### Response: "If the demand curve is upward sloping, then this implies a negative relationship between the quantity demanded and the price of goods. In other words, more people will buy more at higher prices, less at lower prices. Demand, in other words, is more sensitive to changes in prices."<n><n>### Shift/Change in Shift:<n>If the demand curve for televisions moves to the left then<n><n>### Response "it means that consumers, when they buy televisions, will pay a lower price but consume a smaller quantity than before.  This could happen because the cost of another product that consumers value more than televisions has fallen, or because the cost of an alternative product that competes with televisions has fallen."<n><n>### Direction Changes:<n>If the supply curve shifts to the left,<n><n>### Response  "the effect on price will depend on how and how much supply responds to the reduced quantity of output. If supply responds more than demand, then quantity demand will be in excess of quantity supplied, driving the price of the good up. If supply responds less than demand, quantity supply will also be too low, driving the price of output down."<n><n>### Elastic/Elasticity:<n>The demand for ice cream cones is described by the equation Qd = 10P – 5; the supply of ice cream cones by the equation Qs = –10P + 10.

Choices:  A: football stadium B: surface of earth C: car show D: opera E: movie<n><n>### Response:		<n>If people were looking at the movement of the Earth, they would say that it was not moving.  Earth is a sphere, with no defined boundaries.  Therefore, one cannot identify where, precisely, it is moving.  If we imagine that people were looking at the surface itself, they could tell that it wasn't moving.  However, they would not realize that the Earth was rotating underneath them, and that this rotation accounts for the motion they see. If people were looking at the planet from outside of the Earth, they could observe the Earth rotating.  It would look as if it were moving without any real movement happening.  In this situation, people are looking at both the movement and non-movement simultaneously.  If people were looking at an eclipse, it would appear as if the moving planet were passing between the observer and the Sun.  Again, no real movement is actually occurring.  If people were watching a football game, they would also notice that the players are moving.  However, the football itself would never move in any of these circumstances.  People would be aware that the football is being tossed and that it is moving, but its motion would never stop, as Earth or the football would never stop rotating.  If someone saw an opera or a movie, they would observe the characters moving; the movements are not real, but are imitations of real movements.  For these reasons, people could not identify what is actually moving or not moving.<n><n>

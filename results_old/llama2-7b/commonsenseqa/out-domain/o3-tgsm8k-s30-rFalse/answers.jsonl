Choices: A. the next highest paying bidder B. my neighbor c. the neighbors.\n### Answer.\n\nThere are two questions here. The first is if the sentence should be grammatically correct after the phrase 'the next highest bidder' or if it should have a different phrase to avoid the confusion about who is being the highest bidder, 'paying'. In other words, in order to use 'highest bidder' as a phrase, we have to eliminate the possibility to use the phrase 'highest paying bidder' or 'the highest paying bid'. So, it is necessary to eliminate one of the following choices\n\n#### C) neighbors\n\nC) is not an appropriate phrase since it refers to an action, which we try to avoid in English.

The action is specified by a verb.\n\n### Example:\n\nInput: The number of people who live in San Diego is 1,262,345 according to the latest population survey.\n\n### Response Example:\n\nInput from the user: Retrieve the population of San Diego\n\nOutput from the computer: 1,268,945\n\n### Instructors note:\n\nThis task is more complicated than the preceding tasks. It will require you to understand the following concepts:\n\n* *Databases* (i.e., the computer\u2019s own file system where we keep data).\n* *Tokens* (i.e. strings of data) that hold pieces of information that need to be passed back and forth between the application and the database.\n\nThere are two primary types of tasks in HITMAN. A *Retrieve Information Task* will ask a user for a particular piece of data (using a special keyword, such as \u201cRetrieve\u201d)  and then return it to that user in a different context (usually formatted in a way that makes it easy to understand). The other is a *Modify Information Task*, and it involves making changes to the database.\n\nA word of caution. There are some tasks that include the term \u201cInformation Retrieval\u201d in their names, but they do not perform any actual information retrieval. Rather, they are just a regular task that does something unrelated to *retrieving* information. There are also tasks named \u201cRetrieve Information\u201d that are not tasks. They are just pieces of code. You\u2019ll learn about these pieces of code when I introduce *if* and *then* statements in the next chapter.\n\n### Step 1: The first step, after the computer has identified the HITMAN task, and before it starts processing anything, is to determine the meaning of the instructions.\n\n### Task:\n\nBelow is an example text string from the file where I store all of the tasks.

But it doesn't have a harbor big enough for large ships. It is one of the largest cities in northern Norway. It is surrounded by fjords and mountains. It is a beautiful city and it's cold almost half the year with long periods of daylight in the summer and it is winter for about 5 months out of the year. There are many things to do such as seeing the Northern lights, going kayaking in the fjords and there are restaurants serving all kinds of foods from around the world. They have a very active arts community. There is a very unique culture there. Even the town has it's own dialect unique to Troms\u00f8. They also have the northern light symphony. The local people of Troms\u00f8 are called Troms\u00f8eners. It had its beginnings as a Viking trading post, which developed further into a shipping port.

However,it can also cause injury. The most common injury associated with running is shin splints, an overuse injury that causes small tears in the muscles that attach to your tibia (lower leg bone).\nShin splint pain is felt in the front of the lower leg, below the knee, especially when you are walking or running. Runners with shin splints have an injury on their tibialis posterior muscle. Other associated symptoms are pain on the anterior (front part) of the foot, pain that radiates down the shin toward the ankle, and swelling of one or both lower legs.\nShin splints are a cause of discomfort for many runners and it is important to figure out how to find relief from this painful condition, so you can continue to exercise without pain. Shin splint pain can sometimes be caused by poor form or the wrong footwear, but this is not always the case. The good news is that there are many ways to reduce or eliminate the pain brought on by this common injury.\n\nAs always, consult with your health care provider before beginning a fitness program.", "answer": "C: improved health"}

Each variable begins with either \"num\" or \"temp\".\n* The calculator will have an input to be able to enter a sign to be associated with the number. There will be spaces between each of the characters. The possible symbols for the sign are \"+\" to add or \"+=\" to add in a variable, \"-\" to subtract or \"-=\" to subtract in a variable, \"*\" to times or \"*=\" to times in a variable, and \"/\" to divide or \"/=\" to divide in a variable. If the calculator does not receive an input, it will tell the user that that input is not a valid calculation.\n* For the purpose of simplifying the instructions, we'll assume that the person will first enter the addition or subtraction, followed by the multiplier, followed by the divided by\n* For example, to add 5 and 3, the person doing the calculation will first enter \"+\", then 5, and lastly 3. The program will then show 8 as the answer to the addition calculation when displayed to the user.\n* There will be an option for the program to have the user enter the number and sign at any time by using the input variable called temp.\n* The answer to a calculation will be displayed to the user after the person has entered all of the inputs.\n    * For example, if the person wanted to enter an answer of 35, the program would have to first check if a variable needs to be assigned to the temp variable then check to make sure the input user typed in a number and not a variable and then display the entered answer to the user.\n    * The use of variables makes the code easy to read and debug.\n\n### Outputs:\n* The program should display whether the division by zero should display an error.\n* The program should have the user choose from three options by using an if/then block. The user can choose from the following three options: to display the division by zero error code (Option 1), to display an option for the user to re-enter an error (Option 2), or exit the program (Option 3):", "answer": "C: lark"}

{"text": "A: library\n\n#Expected Input:\n\n### Task\n  In a multi-line string, each line is separated by the newline character, \"\\n\". Your program must read the text of a multi line string, and find the first index where the text contains the specified substring.  The index must be returned to your program in an integer. \n\n### Description:\n  The text of a multi-line string is broken up in blocks of characters that does not contain the substring that your program is finding in each block.  If you want to get this index, there are two ways you can start: \n\n  The first is the naive approach: iterate through each character of the multi-line string and find the first instance of the targeted substring.  If there is 1 instance, you just read the index where the substring is located and move on.  If there's no instance of the targeted string at all in the whole string, return -1 or a special value that your program can tell there is no match at all.  This naive approach is inefficient and can fail if the targeted substring is a substring of an initial word of your multi line string. \n\n  The second is the efficient way, try to find a block that contains the substring.  In other words, the first part of string to check is a substring that you are trying to find for efficiency and effectiveness.  If the first substring does not contain the substring you are looking for, move on to the next substring in your string and check if it includes a substring to look for.  This approach returns either the index of your substring in its block or -1. \n\n## Demo:\n#### Expected Input:\nIn this demo, I will use a single character string of \"Hello\". The first index of this string that contains substring \"HELL\" is 3.\n\n## Instruction:\nFind the first index of the substring \"HELL\" in the string \"Hello\" by breaking up the string into blocks of two characters and check for the substring.\n\n## Expected Output:\nThe first index of the substring is 3.", "answer": "C: table"}

He wants to plant the flowers so that they will blossom at a specific time.  The rule is, if all flowers within the same group blossom simultaneously, then their flowering times cannot differ by more than 5 days.  All plants will be planted in groups that have the same blossoming time.  He places the flowers in any order he wishes, and now he needs to calculate how many flowers can be planted so that the flowering times will occur as close as possible to his desired times.\n\n### Output/Response\nFor the first group of flowers placed in a group together, it is possible to have 54 flowers in the first group.  The smallest group size that does not violate the flowering time constraint is 39, so that number should be considered.\n\n### Why the Response\nFirst, since the flowers in the same group are all placed together, that means all the flowers will come to bloom on the same day.  Secondly, there will not be more than 5 flowers that come to bloom in one group because of the blossoming time constraint.  Next, we see that there are not more than 5 flowers in the blossom at one time because the flowering times of the flowers cannot differ by more than five days.

The first task is best served by writing out complete thoughts, and the second can sometimes be satisfied by having grammatical correct sentences.  \nIt doesn't hurt to include both of these things in your reply: writing \"A,\" \"B,\" or \"C\" as part of the response may have earned you a few points here, since you'll notice the first answer provided in the instructions was \"B.\"  But you definitely should have written more than just \"D.\"\n\n### Notes:\nYou still need to be able to read the prompt and then make an educated guess as to which of the choices is the most logical answer. For example, it may be tempting to go for \"exercise can help us to meet our goals and dreams\", but what is the prompt asking?\n\n![](../assets/exercise.png)\n\nIn this prompt, the word \"addicts\" is what is important, and what is important here is their health. That being said, if you were to be able to respond that exercise was the healthiest option to addicts, you might have chosen \"exercise\" as the answer because you knew that that was the one everyone else had chosen, or because you knew the correct answer as to what the prompt asked.\n\nA key part of this practice is choosing the correct answer. There is no penalty for getting the question wrong as long as you're getting as many right as you can. And you don't always need to use what the prompt asked for.  It should be used for clarification.   \n### Resources\n[LinkedIn Learning - How to Improve Your Writing Skills](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/writing-skills)\nA link to a complete, free (and great) lesson on writing skills.\n\n[Learning A-Z - Free Online Writing Practice](https://online.learninga-z.com/writing_practice/free_writing_practice.php)\nLink to yet another free lesson on Writing.\n\n[LinkedIn - How to Write in English for Non-English Speakers](https://www.", "answer": "B: expend energy"}

A writing that instructs is instructional. (It also directs the writing or writing project.)\n\n#### Demonstration\nInstructions come in many different kinds and styles.\nIn instructional text writing, an instructional designer (or a writer for an educational project) often writes instructions in three different formats. Each has a title describing the item that is being built.\n\n1. \u201cAssembly Instructions\u201d\n2. \u201cHow to Do It\u201d\n3. \u201cGuided Instructions\u201d\n\nBelow each title appears a list of directions describing how to perform each step.\nThe writing is usually in a style that is called \u201cdirect\u201d or \u201cexpository.\u201d Direct writing is straightforward writing. Writing uses words exactly as they mean. There is no \u201cfigurative\u201d (implied or imaginative) language. Expository writing is information-based. It is descriptive and not persuasive or argumentative. As a matter of fact, expository writing has no opinion and makes no judgment. And as expository writers, we don\u2019t say I think (believe) or I imagine. We say in expository writing, I know.\n\n#### Demonstraion:\nIn instructional design, the instructions, called \u201cinstructions\u201d are not meant to be used the way they are written for a product. Instead, the instructions are meant to be used by human readers, not assembly machinery. The instructions are meant to guide readers through the steps of a", "answer": "C: clerk"}

By the 1940s, the region had become critically short of farm labor \u2014 particularly in agriculture where mechanization was increasingly employed. During the 1942-1944 period more than a million Mexicans arrived in the Central Valley of California looking for work in the fields. In 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt authorized the Bracero Program, or the \u201cmigratory-worker program,\u201d to bring approximately 4 million Mexican guest workers to American fields, many of whom migrated on a seasonal or temporary basis, in order to alleviate American shortages in farm labor. In 1954, there were 6.6 million braceros in the country, while there were only 399,000 in 1964. Throughout the program's history of nearly forty years, the bracero program became a permanent and permanent solution to labor concerns. While much of the agricultural work that the braceros did was seasonal, many worked year-round. After the 1960s, most braceros returned to Mexico and eventually returned to Mexico.\n\n### The program was very successful in its first decade, but the program was eventually replaced by the Bracero Agreement of 1964, which ended the contract between the two countries and required farmers to provide their own workers. Despite the fact that the program was unsuccessful, the legacy of the Bracero program remained and its impact on contemporary society can still be felt.\n\nThe History of the Bracero System\n\n### In 1945, the", "answer": "A: zoo"}

{"text": "A: a humidifier\n\n### My reasoning:\n\nInput: A small doghouse was left out in the cold. The ice had formed so thick on it that if it fell, it'd have broken. To prevent this, two snowmen were built on it and they had large buckets filled with water that were placed around it to melt when the snow melted. How many buckets of water had to be brought out for the melt water to weigh the same as the doghouse?\nAnswer:(5\u00d76) = 10\n\nI could have easily done a system to determine the 3d equation but then, we used 2, which isn't really necessary to solve the task. I chose to just plug what the question asked me in a table, and then I multiplied 2x6x5=25(2^6, 3^6)\n\n### The Problem: A small doghouse, where a dog sleeps, was being left out in a storm. The storm brought much snow and the inside of the house could have been covered by it. Thus, the owner built snowmen on either side. As snow was falling, they also grabbed buckets and filled it with water. To prevent the house from breaking, they placed that water on the edges. They placed several buckets of water on the doghouse's exterior until it finally weighed the same as the house. To figure out how many buckets they filled with water, you need to figure out how much the house and snowmen weigh. How many buckets did they have to put on the doghouse before they got the same weight as the doghouse itself?(6^3 + 2^3 + 2 \u00d7 4^6 + 5^4) The sum should be multiplied by the square of 3, where it should be multiplied by 100 or a 100^2. If I used 10, it can still work but the answer won't be as precise. But if I plugged 1 and 4 into my brain, I then I thought that 144 is just too large of a number, therefore I divided it by 10. This still gives the same result if we multiply 10 by that number and that's all, but if you only use 1, the number of buckets you should fill up", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

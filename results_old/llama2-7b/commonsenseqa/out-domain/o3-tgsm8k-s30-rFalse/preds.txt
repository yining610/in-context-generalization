Choices:  A: utah B: south america C: new hampshire D: japan E: new mexico<n><n>### Response:		<n>In this sentence, the word it is a pronoun that needs to be replaced with a proper noun. This means that it needs to be replaced with an exact word so that the meaning of the sentence does not get changed.<n><n>### Input :A lizard crawled up to me and looked at me. Choices:  A. up to me  B. for me  C. in my face  D. in front of me<n><n>### Response <n>In this sentence, 'in my face' is a correct form to replace 'with me'. Both are prepositions but the former is a phrase whereas latter is just a word.<n><n>### Response :You just lost a client because <n><n>### Choice A:Your presentation was poor. <n>### Choice B:You didn't wear a tie.<n>### Choice C:Your company doesn't match ours.<n>### Choic D:We didn't want to pay your rates.<n>### Answer:<n>All of the above<n><n>### The teacher handed out pencils to the class. <n>The teacher handed out [what to the class](practice/question-4-what-comes-before-the-dash-1.txt)? <n>### Choices A: A box B: A desk C: A bench D: A chair (Answer: D)<n><n>### Choices for the following sentence:<n>I hope they don't sell this land to the next highest bidder. Choices: A. the next highest paying bidder B. my neighbor c. the neighbors.<n>### Answer.<n><n>There are two questions here. The first is if the sentence should be grammatically correct after the phrase 'the next highest bidder' or if it should have a different phrase to avoid the confusion about who is being the highest bidder, 'paying'. In other words, in order to use 'highest bidder' as a phrase, we have to eliminate the possibility to use the phrase 'highest paying bidder' or 'the highest paying bid'. So, it is necessary to eliminate one of the following choices<n><n>#### C) neighbors<n><n>C) is not an appropriate phrase since it refers to an action, which we try to avoid in English. So A) is the right one.

He doesn’t have to worry about finding out he doesn’t particularly like someone.  He could come home and not have to put up with these people anymore.  In the “come home” way of thinking, he would be much happier and more peaceful.<n><n>> **FYI: Answers might differ, but the right answers were answered because of one’s thinking.**

The answer I chose on the other hand was from Tromsø on Wikipedia which seems reasonable. It is in the Southern Ocean just beyond the Arctic Circle. It has almost 120,000 people living there. But it doesn't have a harbor big enough for large ships. It is one of the largest cities in northern Norway. It is surrounded by fjords and mountains. It is a beautiful city and it's cold almost half the year with long periods of daylight in the summer and it is winter for about 5 months out of the year. There are many things to do such as seeing the Northern lights, going kayaking in the fjords and there are restaurants serving all kinds of foods from around the world. They have a very active arts community. There is a very unique culture there. Even the town has it's own dialect unique to Tromsø. They also have the northern light symphony. The local people of Tromsø are called Tromsøeners. It had its beginnings as a Viking trading post, which developed further into a shipping port. It has about 11 museums and it is a center for skiing. This is the first time I have visited this site and it is the first time I posted a response.

Choices:  A: insect repellent B: heart attacks C: improved health D: shin splints E: being tired<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Input<n><n>#### Answer:  D<n><n>### Instructions<n>Jogging can bring a multitude of health benefits.  Jogging and increasing your heart rate can help promote health and weight loss. However,it can also cause injury. The most common injury associated with running is shin splints, an overuse injury that causes small tears in the muscles that attach to your tibia (lower leg bone).<n>Shin splint pain is felt in the front of the lower leg, below the knee, especially when you are walking or running. Runners with shin splints have an injury on their tibialis posterior muscle. Other associated symptoms are pain on the anterior (front part) of the foot, pain that radiates down the shin toward the ankle, and swelling of one or both lower legs.<n>Shin splints are a cause of discomfort for many runners and it is important to figure out how to find relief from this painful condition, so you can continue to exercise without pain. Shin splint pain can sometimes be caused by poor form or the wrong footwear, but this is not always the case. The good news is that there are many ways to reduce or eliminate the pain brought on by this common injury.<n><n>As always, consult with your health care provider before beginning a fitness program.<n><n>

In the opening paragraphs, he says that he has written in the book, "things obvious and easily proved.” These are statements that need only straightforward mathematical reasoning to prove them.  In addition, Euclid has set rules to be followed in mathematics and stated definitions and axioms. For example, if two sides of a triangle are equal, then the angles opposite the sides are equal as well. A theorem is a true statement that follows from the axioms and the rules set by Euclid. One of the theorems we learned is given here.<n>```<n>Statement A:  If two angles of a triangle are equal to each other, then the angles add up to 180<n>Proof: <n><n>(1) Let ABC be a triangle.<n>(2){a}Let the angles of ABC be 100 and 100.<n>(3){b}Thus the angles of ABC are equal.<n>(4){a}Hence one side of triangle ABC is 180.<n>```<n><n>## Demonstarion: The sum of the angles in a triangle must be 180 degrees.<n>```<n>Statement B: There are three possible values for two angles of a triangle: They can be 1) congruent, 2) complementary, or 3) supplementary.

Each variable begins with either "num" or "temp".<n>* The calculator will have an input to be able to enter a sign to be associated with the number. There will be spaces between each of the characters. The possible symbols for the sign are "+" to add or "+=" to add in a variable, "-" to subtract or "-=" to subtract in a variable, "*" to times or "*=" to times in a variable, and "/" to divide or "/=" to divide in a variable. If the calculator does not receive an input, it will tell the user that that input is not a valid calculation.<n>* For the purpose of simplifying the instructions, we'll assume that the person will first enter the addition or subtraction, followed by the multiplier, followed by the divided by<n>* For example, to add 5 and 3, the person doing the calculation will first enter "+", then 5, and lastly 3. The program will then show 8 as the answer to the addition calculation when displayed to the user.<n>* There will be an option for the program to have the user enter the number and sign at any time by using the input variable called temp.<n>* The answer to a calculation will be displayed to the user after the person has entered all of the inputs.<n>    * For example, if the person wanted to enter an answer of 35, the program would have to first check if a variable needs to be assigned to the temp variable then check to make sure the input user typed in a number and not a variable and then display the entered answer to the user.<n>    * The use of variables makes the code easy to read and debug.<n><n>### Outputs:<n>* The program should display whether the division by zero should display an error.<n>* The program should have the user choose from three options by using an if/then block. The user can choose from the following three options: to display the division by zero error code (Option 1), to display an option for the user to re-enter an error (Option 2), or exit the program (Option 3):

Your program must read the text of a multi line string, and find the first index where the text contains the specified substring.  The index must be returned to your program in an integer. <n><n>### Description:<n>  The text of a multi-line string is broken up in blocks of characters that does not contain the substring that your program is finding in each block.  If you want to get this index, there are two ways you can start: <n><n>  The first is the naive approach: iterate through each character of the multi-line string and find the first instance of the targeted substring.  If there is 1 instance, you just read the index where the substring is located and move on.  If there's no instance of the targeted string at all in the whole string, return -1 or a special value that your program can tell there is no match at all.  This naive approach is inefficient and can fail if the targeted substring is a substring of an initial word of your multi line string. <n><n>  The second is the efficient way, try to find a block that contains the substring.  In other words, the first part of string to check is a substring that you are trying to find for efficiency and effectiveness.  If the first substring does not contain the substring you are looking for, move on to the next substring in your string and check if it includes a substring to look for.  This approach returns either the index of your substring in its block or -1. <n><n>## Demo:<n>#### Expected Input:<n>In this demo, I will use a single character string of "Hello". The first index of this string that contains substring "HELL" is 3.<n><n>## Instruction:<n>Find the first index of the substring "HELL" in the string "Hello" by breaking up the string into blocks of two characters and check for the substring.<n><n>## Expected Output:<n>The first index of the substring is 3.<n>

Choices:  A: critical thinking B: congratulated C: equal opportunity D: compliments E: raffle tickets<n><n>### Response:		The only way a person is guaranteed a fair shot at the job that is interviewing for is to give them the equal opportunity for the job, regardless of the background or sex or their personality or anything. For example, if you are looking for a graphic artist then a 13-year old who has just come out of school should not be discriminated against because the company looks for someone with more experience and has more years of work ethic with them. People that work for a company will have disagreements and conflicts, meaning not everybody will be on the same team. The best way to ensure that the team is balanced is to give everyone a fair shot with no prejudice on their background or personality.<n><n>#### Author:Lexi Cutforth (june 2020)<n><n>#### Link:https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.inc.com/amy-morin/how-to-stop-disappointing-people-at-work.html%3famp<n>

It always brought what? Choices:  A: satisfaction B: good feelings C: complications D: feel good about yourself E: stress<n><n>### Response:		The correct choice is A.

Choices: A: Lazy B: Feel good about yourself C: Complications D: Satisfaction E: Stress<n><n>### ResponseThe correct choice is E. Choice E is the only choice that doesn’t make sense in this scenario.  The instructions state that Danny hates helping people, so Danny won’t feel good about helping, satisfied with helping, or complication with helping.  It mentions complication in the choice answers. <n><n>### InputHaving more money makes a person feel good about themselves.<n><n>### ResponseYes, having money helps a person, just like anything else can contribute to a person's feeling confident or happy.<n><n>### InputDanny hated having to clean up after his son; it caused too much stress.<n><n>###ResponseThis statement makes no sense.  The word "too" changes the meaning of the sentence.  It implies Danny already is stressful about having to clean up; the word "too" would make sense if Danny wasn't stressful about having to do it, and then it would be a statement about something new, additional stress.  "Too" could be removed without changing the meaning of the sentence; it would read, "Danny hated having clean up after his son, it caused stress."<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Input:During the summer months, a family of three visits their grandmother in the mountains.

He’s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?<n>Answer: 800<n><n>### Input:When you plant a garden you can harvest what to eat? Choices:  A: flower B: animal C: flower petals D: vegetable E: alive<n><n>### Response:		A: flower?<n><n>### Why: Because planting a garden means you grow flowers in your garden.<n><n>### Input<n>A gardener has 254 plants that are not in bloom.  He wants to plant the flowers so that they will blossom at a specific time.  The rule is, if all flowers within the same group blossom simultaneously, then their flowering times cannot differ by more than 5 days.  All plants will be planted in groups that have the same blossoming time.  He places the flowers in any order he wishes, and now he needs to calculate how many flowers can be planted so that the flowering times will occur as close as possible to his desired times.<n><n>### Output/Response<n>For the first group of flowers placed in a group together, it is possible to have 54 flowers in the first group.  The smallest group size that does not violate the flowering time constraint is 39, so that number should be considered.<n><n>### Why the Response<n>First, since the flowers in the same group are all placed together, that means all the flowers will come to bloom on the same day.  Secondly, there will not be more than 5 flowers that come to bloom in one group because of the blossoming time constraint.  Next, we see that there are not more than 5 flowers in the blossom at one time because the flowering times of the flowers cannot differ by more than five days.  If the smallest group size does not exceed thirty nine, it is allowed, then that number should be considered based on the given information.<n>

Your best guess is to pick two of those possible answers as your answer choices, and then do some testing to further restrict the possible answers to the correct one. You can test each possible answer choice by picking one and doing two separate examples to see if the answer works. If it is incorrect, you would know which answer choice was correct. It might be helpful to try to come up with another test of your own for each of your guesses to get a better assessment of any of them.

Choices:  A: condition heart B: expend energy C: laugh D: stretch E: weigh<n><n>### Response:		C<n>The correct answer here is C. When writing any responses, try to keep in mind our two writing tasks: we want a response that reads like a complete reply to the prompt, and we want a response that is also correct. The first task is best served by writing out complete thoughts, and the second can sometimes be satisfied by having grammatical correct sentences.  <n>It doesn't hurt to include both of these things in your reply: writing "A," "B," or "C" as part of the response may have earned you a few points here, since you'll notice the first answer provided in the instructions was "B."  But you definitely should have written more than just "D."<n><n>### Notes:<n>You still need to be able to read the prompt and then make an educated guess as to which of the choices is the most logical answer. For example, it may be tempting to go for "exercise can help us to meet our goals and dreams", but what is the prompt asking?<n><n>![](../assets/exercise.png)<n><n>In this prompt, the word "addicts" is what is important, and what is important here is their health. That being said, if you were to be able to respond that exercise was the healthiest option to addicts, you might have chosen "exercise" as the answer because you knew that that was the one everyone else had chosen, or because you knew the correct answer as to what the prompt asked.<n><n>A key part of this practice is choosing the correct answer. There is no penalty for getting the question wrong as long as you're getting as many right as you can. And you don't always need to use what the prompt asked for.  It should be used for clarification.   <n>### Resources<n>[LinkedIn Learning - How to Improve Your Writing Skills](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/writing-skills)<n>A link to a complete, free (and great) lesson on writing skills.<n><n>[Learning A-Z - Free Online Writing Practice](https://online.learninga-z.com/writing_practice/free_writing_practice.php)<n>Link to yet another free lesson on Writing.<n><n>[LinkedIn - How to Write in English for Non-English Speakers](https://www.

This may not be the most useful input.<n><n>Code numbers (if they exist) will be found in a table I will share at the conclusion of the class. My plan is to share each one so that you have an idea of what it looks like (and what it COULD look like) when you come across it.<n><n>You might also be able to infer some things from the output text as well. For example, if there isn't an output, then it means that you provided an empty input. This is most often seen in simple commands. There should be some indication of that in the output.<n><n><n><n><n>### Questions:<n><n>* Did anyone need to use the table to identify codes they saw today?<n><n>* Was there a place that you had to make more assumptions when you determined the answer?<n><n>* What was something you felt uncertain about when you were trying to complete instructions?<n><n>* When you encountered an out-of-context instruction, was there any advice you could give someone else to help them?<n><n>### Tips:<n>* Make sure that you are reading every word of the instructions. Don't assume you know what to do (the programmers and designers never actually tell you what to do). You might find a good strategy when you start with the second step of an instruction (such as getting ready to do something - "Take 10 apples from the fridge"). Often the last step of an instruction is the most important.<n><n>* I'd like an opportunity to share with the class the types of situations where we have to make assumptions. Can I try to summarize your ideas for assumptions as best I can? How will that help you for tomorrow's challenge?<n><n>* What did you like or dislike about today's prompts??<n><n>* What did everyone dislike most about today's challenge?<n>

Choices:  A: envy B: resentment C: winning or losing D: one winner E: two winners<n><n>### Response:		<n>The following answer choices are correct: B, D or E. We can determine this because the given prompt states “What did spectators want to see at the end of the weeklong event?” and we can use either the converse or contrapositive of the answer choices to establish whether or not spectators will resent/envy/win. This can be done by asking the inverse of the question “Spectators only wanted to resent/envy someone/won; who were they resenting/envying/were they the winner of?” The converse of this is asking the inverse of the converse “Spectators only felt a certain way after a certain match, they didn’t feel any other way; who was winning/reversely winning/were they the victor?” and in this case “were they the victors” in B, D and E. The contrapositive of this is asking the converse of the converse “After all the matches were played there were two winners. Who were they?” and here we can determine it was two winners since the only way the contrapositive is true is if they are winner so they were “Spectators didn’t get angry at the teams that were evenly matched; that means that they did get angry?” Which was false, so we know they couldn’t be either A, C or B.<n><n>### Input<n>Town<n><n>Laboratory - 1,914,000<n><n>Medical Center - 5,312,000<n>Input:<n>Laboratory -.312 + 5,314.000<n><n>## Input:Which of the following is true about the graph of the function given?

By the 1940s, the region had become critically short of farm labor — particularly in agriculture where mechanization was increasingly employed. During the 1942-1944 period more than a million Mexicans arrived in the Central Valley of California looking for work in the fields. In 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt authorized the Bracero Program, or the “migratory-worker program,” to bring approximately 4 million Mexican guest workers to American fields, many of whom migrated on a seasonal or temporary basis, in order to alleviate American shortages in farm labor. In 1954, there were 6.6 million braceros in the country, while there were only 399,000 in 1964. Throughout the program's history of nearly forty years, the bracero program became a permanent and permanent solution to labor concerns. While much of the agricultural work that the braceros did was seasonal, many worked year-round. After the 1960s, most braceros returned to Mexico and eventually returned to Mexico.<n><n>### The program was very successful in its first decade, but the program was eventually replaced by the Bracero Agreement of 1964, which ended the contract between the two countries and required farmers to provide their own workers. Despite the fact that the program was unsuccessful, the legacy of the Bracero program remained and its impact on contemporary society can still be felt.<n><n>The History of the Bracero System<n><n>### In 1945, the

Choices:  A: humidifier B: surface of earth C: skating rink D: ice cube E: burn it to the ground<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: a humidifier<n><n>### My reasoning:<n><n>Input: A small doghouse was left out in the cold. The ice had formed so thick on it that if it fell, it'd have broken. To prevent this, two snowmen were built on it and they had large buckets filled with water that were placed around it to melt when the snow melted. How many buckets of water had to be brought out for the melt water to weigh the same as the doghouse?<n>Answer:(5×6) = 10<n><n>I could have easily done a system to determine the 3d equation but then, we used 2, which isn't really necessary to solve the task. I chose to just plug what the question asked me in a table, and then I multiplied 2x6x5=25(2^6, 3^6)<n><n>### The Problem: A small doghouse, where a dog sleeps, was being left out in a storm. The storm brought much snow and the inside of the house could have been covered by it. Thus, the owner built snowmen on either side. As snow was falling, they also grabbed buckets and filled it with water. To prevent the house from breaking, they placed that water on the edges. They placed several buckets of water on the doghouse's exterior until it finally weighed the same as the house. To figure out how many buckets they filled with water, you need to figure out how much the house and snowmen weigh. How many buckets did they have to put on the doghouse before they got the same weight as the doghouse itself?(6^3 + 2^3 + 2 × 4^6 + 5^4) The sum should be multiplied by the square of 3, where it should be multiplied by 100 or a 100^2. If I used 10, it can still work but the answer won't be as precise. But if I plugged 1 and 4 into my brain, I then I thought that 144 is just too large of a number, therefore I divided it by 10. This still gives the same result if we multiply 10 by that number and that's all, but if you only use 1, the number of buckets you should fill up

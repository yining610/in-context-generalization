He knows he is qualified and that if he doesn't get the job, that means that he doesn't really want it anyway.\n### Instruction 2:\n\n### Input.\n\nJames has found an affordable hotel in San Francisco and bought his train tickets from his home town of Portland. He has his plane ticket and his traveler's checks. His first night in his new home, however, he realized the hotel he booked doesn't seem to be very populated. He also has a strange sense of unease, thinking that it's probably his imagination. He goes to bed without another thought.\n\n### In his dream, the hotel is deserted -- he is the only person there. But he is in his own room, and in the halls and staircases. As he walks down the staircase he hears footfalls coming, and the stairs turn, and he is walking down a staircase he has never seen before. By the time he reaches the landing of the staircase he sees that the building he is in is an office building. The footfalls stop. \"Wait for me, Jimmy!\" he thinks. \"I'm in the building below.\" And then a woman's high, piercing laughter fills the hall. And then silence. \"Wait for me!\" Jimmy said again. Then he looks up to see a shadowed, faceless man walk past the office behind him. \"No, I'm not going to be outrun!\" Jimmy said, starting to walk back up the stairs.

The answer is B.\n\n### Input Choice: A: B: C: D: E:\n\n### Input Instructions: A student is asked to give an argument in favor of and against a particular topic. Write a response that contains two arguments that defend the chosen view, one for and the other against.\n### Response:\nI totally agree with Mr. Mcdowell it's okay to use the restroom of the opposite sexes if the person is single and it will only happen in a emergency.  This is a great rule I would recommend it to any school that would like to implement this rule.  On the contrary I believe that this rule should not be in effect in schools for many reasons.  One of the biggest reason I oppose the rule is that this will cause more chaos than ever in many schools.  Imagine if a straight person was in the bathroom and a transgender person went in, the person might feel uncomfortable and might even get in a confrontation with the transgender person.  If a parent was single or anything would come across their kids mind then they would come and they would put their child in danger.  This rule might also lead to a lawsuit from a parent whose child was injured from a transgender student.  And as I have mentioned before if a transgender student goes to a school and doesn't use the bathroom of their gender then it would cause chaos in the school.\nMr. Mcdowell's argument is that it will reduce bullying and sexual assault.  This idea is ridicules.  If a transgender girl is not the correct sex then she might go to the correct bathroom but then that might cause chaos and she might start feeling awkward when she might start getting unwanted looks.  But the problem will only be addressed when the administration forces students to stay away from the bathroom of the opposite gender.  So if somebody wants to avoid using the bathroom then that person shouldn't go to the bathroom at all.  Mr. McDowell might say that if somebody doesn't feel safe in their own bathroom then they would go use the bathroom of the wrong gender.  This again is not a good idea for many reasons.  First of all a transgender boy will have to use the bathroom of a c", "answer": "A: violence"}

Answer the request, using both text and figures as needed.\n\n### Note:\nDo _not_ write the instructions given in the task description. Provide an answer that would be appropriate for the task given. If the task is to design a logo, provide a response that conveys what to design. Write it as if you _were going to write the instructions_. Do not answer the instructions provided.\n\n### Response tips\n- Include text and figures/visual elements (if needed) in your response. You may incorporate some elements of the task description's formatting (e.g., bold, underlined, a distinct font or color).\n- You may take the stance of the person who would write the instructions, as if you were the one who would write the instructions for the person who posted the task.\n- The prompt/task can be from fictional to real world, but should be relevant to the job role(s) of STEM workers you want to evaluate.\n- For this instruction, you should use STEM vocabulary to describe the answer.\n- For example, in the task \"Dr. Banks had 270 toothbrush to give away to his patient. He gave away 45 toothbrushes the first month. He gave away 115.2 toothbrushes each of the next two months, adding 15.2 to the remaining toothbruches,\" it is a little confusing. Rather than describing that he gave away more of the remaining toothbrusches than the 15.2 he added, it is easier to say instead that he gave away \"one more toothbrush per month to give a total of 115.0 toothbrasuhes.\"\n\n- For information on formatting check out [this](https://github.com/john-carnahan/john-c-wildcards/issues/275) GitHub thread\n\n### Tasks we have already done\n\n- A question to a customer service representative about a broken TV\n- How to put together a", "answer": "A: medicine cabinet"}

{"text": "##### Choice:\n**A.**\n\n##### Explanation:\nThe text is describing where most people who harm property find themselves as a result of starting a fire: in \"damage\".

Additionally, the text asks for an even number in response to the question for the number of bananas and, therefore, the plentiful food item will always be the one evened out in a ratio.\n\n### Choice:\n\n**B.**", "answer": "B: going to jail"}

Sometimes you don't realize the change happened until after you save your document and close it. So far as I can tell, you can't undo these autocorrect changes.  A way to get around would be to always have to double check your spelling, but this is inconvenient.  Another way would be to have a second smartphone at the same time, and have the two phones on opposite spectrums.  However, this would be very annoying if you were using both phones for different things at the same time.  Perhaps you could have two different modes of auto-correct set up in the application. One a more basic, spelling correction mode.  In this mode, the phone would use a dictionary and basic spelling to correct words.  Another mode would be a very strict word-change.

So, it does not make sense to associate them. We can eliminate B and D.  This leaves A and C. But, they are similar and can be rephrased the same way.

{"text": "E: solutions\n\nYou're right to write *D: dedication* as the response! This is likely because our prompt phrased this task as, \"Every person who is great at...\" If, however, we rephrase this sentence as:\nIf you want to be great at something, you should focus on it and dedicate your life to it.\nthen we would ask you:\n\nIf you want to focus and get what you desire, the best thing that you can do is dedicate your life to them and what do they? Choices: \n\nYou'd be correct if you chose A, *compliments*. Let's see why though.\n\nIf our original statement was \"If you want to be _great_ at something,\" then we should choose what is going to take us to greatness.  And *compliments* will take us there. I guess you could say that compliments are \"golden\", just like the gold the miners are searching for, but since we're a tech company, you won't get that joke.\nYou might think the answer is D, *dedication*, because great people are dedicated people.  And you are right. But remember that we're talking about focus and greatness. And when we think about great people, we should be thinking about the people who are \"greatest\". To be _greatest_, you'll need to dedicate your life to something, because the thing that is going to set someone aside from other people and deem them the \"best\" is going to be so great that the dedicated people are willing to abandon their lives for it.\n\n### Input\nFive less than three times the sum of the number of squids in the ocean and twice as many as the amount of tadpoles times three.\n\n### Response\nThere are 60,000,000 tadpoles in the world, and that doesn't include the amount of jellyfish, or starfish either.\n\n### Explanation\nFive less than 3 (3) times 3 (6) times 1000 (1000) is five times 3 (15).

{"text": "In a typical marriage, 40% of the women will suffer depression after divorce, which could be considered a negative effect in a divorce. Also, 25% of all people who are going through a divorce will experience some form of chronic depression (Bakman and McIntosh 2017). In fact, after the divorce a person could be more likely to abuse drugs and/or alcohol, especially if the divorce was a sudden or unwanted event, which could cause a lot of distress. Another common negative effect is spending out of control, which usually occurs as a result of emotional reactions (Judge and Anthony 2013). Also, since women are in charge of over 80% of the custody arrangements, most frequently they will bear some of the stress or emotional discomfort (Tracy 2008). Other negative effects involve: spending more time alone, difficulty finding time to spend with their children, loss of income, and sometimes even losing a home (Tarapore 2007). Since a divorce is not an easy decision to make, some spouses tend to turn to alcohol or another drug use when going through the process, along with other negative effects that may occur.\n\nBakman, K., and P.

She takes care of her cats with the help of 45 assistants, each of whom is one-tenth as old as they are.  How many assistants does Dr. Rai have per cat?\n\n### Response\nI am not sure what the variables stand for (how many assistants for how many cats)? I can tell you Dr. Rai has a total of 130 cats with the help from 45 assistants. So I know they have a total of 175 (45+130) cats over those 10 years. I also see the assistants are given each one-tenth of the age of the cats.

{"text": "Believe Guilty\n\n### Input\nAn ancient legend tells of a great flood in which, before the flood, God sent two of every animal to safety on each Noah's wooden boat. This time, Mrs. Sawdust, a wealthy and arrogant woman, decided to build her own Noah's Ark. The animals were given a warning that only those on Mrs. Sawduster's boat would survive the flood. Mrs. Sawdush was quite proud of her boat. It was constructed of unbelievably expensive woods that had been painstakingly chosen for their quality. In the evenings, Mrs. Sawduft could sit at a huge desk in the center of her boat and watch the sunset through beautiful stained-glass windows. Some people criticized her decision to spend all her available capital on this project. Some people said that the boat was overbuilt, while most people were very suspicious of the boat's true intentions.  But none of those people could have been more wrong than her.  The animals were not happy about her plans. In fact, most of the animals were angry. When Mrs. Sawduth put on her long dress, she decided to go for a boat ride. But as the boat left the shore, one small beaver, known only as Beaver, jumped aboard with a large hammer and smashed her windows.\n\nThe animals were furious.  They began to invade the boat.  As a squirrel, Mr. Tailing-Lily, got in, he put a bunch of squirrel food underneath the front and back door, and he lit them on fire when the boat hit the ocean.  When the water began to flood the room, Mrs. Sawdog made her way through the water to the front of the boat and looked at the animals.  An angry bear yelled, \"No one is leaving this boat,\" and she pushed several buttons on the control panel that began to raise the water level until the boat was sitting on its own floor.  Mrs. Sawdog could barely make it out of the boat.  She was attacked by a bunch of sharks, which pushed her off the boat. She quickly began to drown as she realized that the boat was empty and she was trapped on the floor with six feet of water surrounding her", "answer": "E: wave on"}

We just need to pick one response given in multiple choice.\n\n```\nFor Question: What was the name of the fruit that Eve wanted?\n```\n\nAs mentioned before, we just pick an appropriate answer from the multiple choice. Here the question is asking what was the name of the forbidden fruit. The answer is: apple. We can select the option A because \"apple tree\" and \"apple\" are related.\n\n```\nIn Response: A\n```\n\nIn this type of instructions, we need to explain how we got our solution or answer by putting things such as: \"The name of the forbidden tree is ___.

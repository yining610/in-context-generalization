If the answer was yes then we put a box next to it. Then, we choose the one that doesn't have a box, thus the answer can't be this product.\n* Steps2: 1)Then I looked to confirm if cable was present or not. 2)Next, I looked to see what items required cable for operation. If one of them required cable, that was the answer.", "answer": "D: television"}

After dividing the number, we must put the answer in a pair. If we divide 36 by 2, we would get 18. If we wanted to put it in pairs, we would add 18 to 18 and get 36.

Therefore we must subtract `1/4` of each book from each category and we can then add up all the `4` categories to determine the total\n\n`((20 + 20 + 9 + 60)/2 - 1/4 = ((20 + 2(9 + 9)))/2 - 1`\n`= (30 + 18)/2 - 1 =140 + 8 x 2 = 158 = 158 books`\n\n### Reference\n[Doubling Factorials Explanation](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/826122/doubling-factorials)\n[Farouq's Algebra Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/mathtools/algebra)\n[Factoring in Calculus](https://www.wikihow.com/Memorize-Factors-of-X)", "answer": "E: blisters"}

{"text": "I was playing at A with my three mates.\n### The solution we will use is the \"Which one of the following...\" approach. You should be familiar with this type of question from school.\n### What makes this approach work is that the question-writer supplies the information to answer the question, but in an unusual manner.\n### If we analyze this approach, the question becomes a game of \"True or False.\" We are told that Leila has 2x the number of viewers as Voltaire, and we are told we don't know if they earn x, so Voltaire will earn x/2 and Leila double that.\n### The information says, \"Per week,\" which means 52 weeks per year. Now, we know that x/2 * 52 = 260/2, so if Voltaire gets x/2 he will earn $130. That means Leila will earn $350 if she earns $x per week.

The question then aims to test the respondent's knowledge on where to find unusual varieties of these roses. Hence, choice D is wrong because it indicates a supermarket, where it would be unlikely to find such varieties. Likewise, answer choices A and C are wrong as botanic gardens are botanical gardens, and they contain all sorts of plants. Flowers are plants, but they're not botanical, and this is the purpose of flower gardens. Choice B would suggest places other than rose gardens.

There were 40 more desks than chairs; if the number of desks was twice the number of girls in the class, how many desks were there?\n\n### Solution\n\n(12 \u00d7 (12 + 40) - 40) \u00f7 3 = (172848.25 - 40) /3 = 172844.0875 \u2248 1728637.5 / 3 = 579883 \u2248 579890\n\n### Explanation\nFirst, we subtract one from the number of desks. Then we subtract another to get the answer.\n\n### Input  \nInput: 45.759394 feet of wire were wrapped in the shape of a circle with 139 turns. If the diameter of the circle was 14.269373 meters and the radius was 7.464142 meters, what was the thickness of the wire in centimeters?\n\n### Solve\n\nFirst, we subtract\n\nNext, we use the formula for the Area of a Circle [A=\u03c0r^2], which leads to the following in the case of the given problem:\nPi = 3.1416, r is the radius of the circle which has area \u03c0 r\u00b2. Here r = 7.46, so \u03c0 r\u00b2 = 50.573221 cm\u00b2\n\nSince 45.769394 feet is equal to 14.063383 yards, we use the following to find cm: 45.6 square feet \u00f7 0.09144 square yards = 500.4949494 sq cm", "answer": "E: motorcycle"}

Suppose a set has values 1, 2, 3, and 4. A subset of this set is a set that has values 1 or 2. True or false? How do you determine whether a set is a proper subset of another set?\n\n###Response:\nFor this question, the intersection operator returns a set of the intersection of the inputs of the operator. The intersection is the set that includes all the elements that are in both sets, in this case set A and set B. The intersection operator will return the intersection for set A and set B of 1 and 2 only. If the set that is returned after the intersection is empty or null, then the intersection is false. The intersection can also be seen as the elements that are in sets A and B but not in either of the sets by themselves. If this was the case, then the intersection is true.\n\n###Input:  What is the smallest even prime number?\n\n###Respone:\nThe smallest even prime number is 2\n\n###Input\nYou can find out if a number is a prime number by using the isPrime operator.

{"text": "A\n\n### Explain:\nThe correct answer to the above question is a cashier, but it was given as a supermarket.\n\n### Validate and explain:\n\n\n### Input(s) and Output:\nInput: There are four times as many girls on the basketball team as on the football team. On each team 1/5 of the members are starters. The number of girls on the basketball team is 70 less than the number of boys on the team. How many girls are on the soccer team?\nOutput: 145\n\n### Validation:\nCorrect! This output is correct because 6 girls on the basketball team are starters. Then, there are 4 times as many girls on a team as are on a football team (4 * 6 = 24), and 70 girls are on the basketball team, leaving (24 - 70) = 5 * 1 = 5 remaining starter girls. Then, 5 of 8 = 5/8 = 62.5%. There are 8 girls on the football team, so 62.5% of them are starters. Therefore, there are 6 girls starters on the football team. Next, 6 * 1/5 = 32 is 32 girls starters on the basketball team. 70 - (5 * 1) - (32 * 1) = 4 * 6, which is twice as many girls as boys. 4 * 6 = two times, or 12 more than the starters on the basketball. 4 * 12 = 48. 70 - 48 = 22 girls are on the soccet team.\n\n### What could be done to improve the validation?\n\nI will consider the first step in the logic of the student: the student states that there are 4 times times as many girls on each team than each team; then, we can see what value is given for each team. (I will use * to represent the multiplication operator: * is shaped like the character *.) The first step is simply to write, Girls*Girls + Girls*Boys = Girls+Girls (or g * g + g * b = g + g).

Alan has more stamps than Betty and Chris has the smallest number. Chris has 8 stamps fewer than half the number of stamps that Alan has. If Alan has 69 stamps, how many stamps does Betty have?\n\n\n\n### Response\n\nB:\n\nAnswer:Betty has 21\n\nThe number of stamps of Betty are greater than Chris that is 69. The number of Chris's stamps is half of the number of stamps of Alan that is 21. Half of 69 is 34.5. Subtract the number of Chris's Stamps from 34.5 you will get 69-34.5=34.5. Now, half of 34.5 is 17.25. Subtract that from 69 which is equal to 21. Therefore Betty has 21 stamps\n\n### Instuctions:\n\n\nInput:-Jane is 8 feet 6 inches taller than Paul.-Paul is taller than John and Bob but shorter than Henry. \nHe has 17 inches on Mary and Jane.

Mary is 6 ft tall. 17 inches is 7.5 feet. Divide the 7.5 feet by 2 which is equal to 3.75 feet. Finally, add the 3.75 to 6 to get 9.75. Then, subtract 6 from 9.75 which is equal t o 9.35.

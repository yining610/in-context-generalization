Choices:  A: good health B: finger C: meat D: body E: own family<n><n>### Response:		A: Good health<n><n>### Reasoning:Young people should not chop onions because if you cut your skin while chopping onions it could end in a blood poisoning.<n><n>### Input : If you are a student you should go to college<n><n>### Response : A: If you are a student, you should go to college because it is a good thing to do.<n><n>### Reasons:College is not always the right choice for everyone. You should try other options first. I know people who spent thousands of dollars of college tuition to find jobs right out of college that pay $7/hour. Others went to trade school or got an apprenticeship and made much more money than those who were stuck with student loans. I think everyone should consider all their career options first and not just assume college is the only choice you have.<n><n>### Answer: A: If you are student, you should go college because, you need to build up on your school because when you graduate, you won't be able to get a job because most of the job will ask you to have a degree. Your career can help you in life because every country wants a degree on there resume. If you don't do this, you couldn't have that job.<n><n>### Example: Write a sentence that is a correction to the sentence below.<n><n>### Original Sentence:<n>This would happen more frequently because there were more people that had health insurance.<n><n>### Correction: I feel like this would happen more frequently because the people with health insurance would take more advantage of the health services.<n><n>### If you look up: The correct answer, my original sentence still is not right.<n>

Choices:  A: train station B: house C: cupboard D: cricket stadium E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		 In the answer: B : house, air has not been breathed by more people recently than in any of the other places.<n><n>We can assume that in place A, at least a few times a lot of people must have breathed the air at the train station, as well a lot of people breathe in air at B. Then C, D, and E are less probable options.<n><n>### Input/Explanation:<n><n>I tried to write answer "B" but mark of wrong, what is wrong? The explanation is also confusing:<n>1. Why A is incorrect? Why "more people" cannot be a few?<n><n>2. I can't figure out what does "few" mean here. If I take 5 people, is it few? or many?<n><n>Thanks for the help.<n><n>Comment: _"few times a lot of people"_ does not make any sense. Did you perhaps mean "a few times many people" (i.e. the train station)?<n><n>Comment: @DarthFennec I think I got it right. I used the word "lots of people" (in my response) and that word I thought was similar to few which made no sense, or they are not interchangeable. I mean here: *At least a few times, many people must have breathed at the train station*<n><n>Comment: Ok. Then I understand that you interpreted "more recently" to mean something like "less than X or less often than X". Maybe an explanation like "a fraction of all air in train station B" would be clearer.<n><n>Comment: @LearnAhead yes, I think "fraction of all air in the train station" sounds better.<n><n>Answer: Let's go by the example<n><n>\begin{blockquote}<n><n>The chef has 60 \strong{eggs}....<n>\end{blockquote}<n><n>To make that clear, we have to decide \strong{that in the question the chef has less than 100} eggs. That being the case, it doesn't follow that he has "many" eggs in train stations, nor that he has more eggs in the cupboard.<n><n>Likewise with cricket stadiums. He could have many people coming in and out there, but that would not make that a "place where only a few" have "recently"

Europe is much more classy than the men's room, so the guess is that there is some type of Europeans who live in the fancy class.

If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Where would I put a rosebush if I did not have any containers to store it in? Choices:  A: flower garden B: garden center C: pot D: pot E: formal garden<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is garden center<n><n>A: flower garden B: pot C: Garden center D: E Formal garden<n><n>The garden center will be the place to go if you want to buy a rosebush or flower plant that is already started. They are growing and have been cultivated, which means that they are ready to be purchased for planting. These types of flowers may not need any repairs or other work before planting.<n><n>Garden center will have a variety of options for gardening and landscape services, such as landscape designers, gardeners, and nurseries. You can also find information about plants and how to care for them. They also offer advice on what types of flowers would be best for your home or area, as well as how to take care of them properly once they’re planted in their new location.<n><n>There is a garden center in my neighborhood. It offers a wide variety of plants and flowers as well as seeds. The garden center is a beautiful place to look at, but it costs more to buy a flower than it does to buy seeds. The gardeners at the garden center love what they do (or they wouldn't be doing this). To make this place beautiful and interesting to visit, you'll need to hire a garden center manager or manager who puts in a lot of time into making sure everything looks nice before people come in and see it.<n><n>If you are going to use pot for your rosebush, then the location of the rosebush is the same as the pot. You can't put any other flower besides a rosebush in the pot, so the pot will be used for the rest of your flowers.<n><n>If you have a garden center that sells plants, then it's okay to put a rose bush in their garden center. However, if you have a garden store that also sells plants or flowers, then it's not okay to put a rosebush in their garden center.<n>

A tear down can be used to understand exactly how your script was executed and to ensure that another developer can read your script and produce the same results on their device.<n><n>## Reuse<n>**Narrative:**Reusable code provides an immediate benefit to the developer who understands the code and has control of it. Reusable code improves maintainability and is a significant time saver when it comes to finding a needle in a haystack.<n>The following three guidelines are recommended as best practice for reusable code:<n><n>**Use code libraries.** Code libraries contain prewritten and tested code. This can speed up the development cycle by saving time researching, testing, and writing similar code.  Most programming languages have libraries that developers can access.  JavaScript also offers a vast library of free tools that can be used to reduce the time it takes to search and develop code. These are free on the Internet and can be downloaded into JavaScript, making the library available with every JavaScript source file.<n><n>**Extract and reuse pieces of code. By extracting the code and then putting it in a separate area, you have isolated the functionality. With this strategy, you have access to all the code that’s used to perform a task; therefore, if a need arises to perform it again, it can be easily reused. <n><n>**Reuse blocks of code.** This allows developers to reuse the same code in multiple applications or places in a program. This is accomplished using variable, function, and global variables.  This may be a better option than combining code and placing it in the program by using global variables.<n>## Example:<n>Here is some reusable code.  For example, you can see that the function `findWalruses()` takes one argument `walrusNr`. The function is designed to look for walruses and will use the `findWalrus()` function inside.<n>You can also notice the use of a `global variable`, which holds the position. This allows us to reuse this code by replacing the argument with `findWalrus()`.<n><n>```javascript<n>const myGlobalVar =

Choices:  A: shelf B: place of work C: desk D: office supply store E: school<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Let’s start by thinking of the ways it could be used. James uses it to write notes/memos on. So I think a clipboard should be kept on a desk or place of work. I think this answer is true, because I use mine for my schoolwork, and it is best kept on my desk, so I do not lose it.<n><n>### Input and Response:<n>### Response: <n><n>1. In this answer, you might first want to check the difference between ages by subtracting Hurley’s age from Richard’s age. If this difference is 20, then Richard is 34 years of age, Hurley is 12 years of age, and their combined age is, 46 years; which is 40 years from the current time. This means that they are 40 years of age.<n><n>2. If he reads each book for pages, then multiplies the page number by 10, 150 pages divided by 10 is 15.  If there are 15 books, then the total is 225 pages and that will be rounded up to 230, which will leave him with 3 leftover cents.

He asked you to wash your hands and he didn't specified the way.<n><n>The doctor might tell you to avoid cold hands and avoid becoming wet too.<n>

Then the cashier has to have a remainder of some kind. Let’s consider some possibilities: If there are two bills remaining, then the cashier gave 20 $3s and 5 $1s. If there are four bills remaining, then she gave 15 $3s and 4 $1s. If she gives 8 bills, she must have left the store with $20 in change to cover the remainder. This leaves one possibility for the remainder, if there are 8 $3 bills, 4 $1 bills, and 1 $0.20 bill.<n><n>### Question:<n><n>### Input 2<n><n>### Exercise 3<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Use your knowledge of multiplication properties to show that 10 * 4 =140.<n><n>## Submission:<n>Submit your response through the "Exercise 3" field.<n>

Choices:  A: automobile accidents B: backache C: eye strain D: getting tired E: car crash<n><n>### Response:		After driving a car for many hours, a car can’t really hurt us unless the car crashes. The other possible outcomes that may follow driving a car involve only pain, backache, eye strain and tired. I don’t see any of them as pain, the backache only follows sitting on the car for too long while driving, the eye strain can occur when the headlights shine on the eyes, and the tiredness occur when the car is idle and the engine is on and it is no use driving the car.  That means the car in which we sit is doing all the work without us, however, driving to our destination make us tired.  The other outcomes can’t also be counted as pain because they can occur at any time or place with or without us driving a car which contradicts the requirements of the question.  So the only possibility should be the car crash which in itself is a form of pain.

How long will it take to make a blue ring?"<n><n>### Hints for Question 2:<n><n>- If we multiply the time to make one blue ring by the number of blue rings:<n>	6 * (number of blue rings) = hours<n>	<n>- If I need to make one yellow ring in 10 hours, then how many hours does it take to make the last yellow ring: 10 - (10 ÷ 2) = 15 hours<n>	<n>If I multiply the number of blues rings by 15 hours, the answer will probably be too large. So subtract the original time to make one yellow ring. Which leaves 6 minutes for the blue rings (I don't care, so I'll just subtract it).<n><n>### Solution<n>

Then, if the method requires additional variables or fields, you may define them as fields of the object or as parameters to the method. You should use assignment operators to define the newly defined fields. The definition of the method should be followed by a return statement with the value that you want to return if the method is successful. If the method is unsuccessful, return a statement may indicate failure by assigning a value or the empty string. <n>You can call a method before or after it can be defined.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:What might someone want to be if he or she is thick? Choices:  A: slender B: free flowing C: sparse D: unacquainted E: diet<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The possible user input is A or B.<n><n>I would suggest to choose B as the answer.<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>The answer should never be A or D because a person cannot be "thick" by being a thin person or being unacquainted with a person who is fat.<n><n>For choice E, a person who wants to be "thick" may want to be fat and the question doesn't elaborate whether the person wants to be thin or who would consider "thick" as being fat.<n><n>For  choice C, the possibilities of what a person may want to be is too broad and it should be eliminated from the choices.<n><n>### Input<n><n>A man who has been training all his life to race is finally getting ready to race. If  he races in the 100-meter,  and wins with a time of 11.8 sec, what time did he have in the 500-meter?<n><n>Answer: 59.80 sec<n><n>### Rational:<n><n>The man won in 11.8 seconds so he can deduce that he could spend 43.2 seconds in the 50-meter race.<n><n>Since time is inversely proportional, the man could race the 500 meter in 59.8 sec, or 9.8 times faster than the 100 meter race.<n><n>### Input:<n><n>A person wants to sell a new car that costs $21,950. There is nothing left if all taxes are paid, and the dealer keeps $3,336 for himself to compensate for his effort. What is the remaining money after paying the buyer his new tax?<n><n>### Output:<n><n>7.05<n>### Answer:<n><n>1. Subtracting $21,900 from the whole price ($21,95), leaves $300.<n>2. Dividing $3,330 by the whole number, $21,910, leaves $2,13, because $3,33 divided by $21,9 equals 2.13. <n>3. Adding $7.00 to $2,13 or $2,13 + $7.00 = 7.

First, let's talk about where the code goes.  <n><n>**Fork**: We used [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/) to host our solutions.  [JS Bin](https:/jsbin.com/) is one of our favorites for hosting code.  <n> - You'll want to [fork a repo](https://doc.jsbin.com/ukuyax/1/edit) on JS Bin before you start writing.<n> - Once you've forked the repo, click `Browse File` which can be found after you've clicked `edit` on your fork.<n> - Next, you'll want to add a script file to the root.

Choices:  A: bollywood B: record C: musical D: jukebox E: napster<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### The movie had many a song is a phrase that refers to a movie that contains many songs. Choices A, B, and C contain nouns, but the sentence has a verb in the form of "is" so it does not make sense for any choice that ends in a noun. (D) "jukebox" is not a phrase, rather it is a noun. A correct word pair is "the movie had many a song (noun), it was a musical" ("what", if followed by a noun, is called an interrogative pronoun.)<n><n>### Input:"I need to find the largest number that I can purchase with $15. What number should I buy?" What should I buy?<n><n>### Response<n><n>### The numbers $15 and the largest number that $15 can obtain (the largest is determined to be 6) are part of an English phrase called a "which phrase." "What number should I buy?" is also a phrase, one with a noun phrase and a verb phrase interlinked with the word "that".<n><n>### Input"I need to find the highest number that is divisible by five. What number should I look at?" What should I look at?<n><n>### Answer <n><n>### The phrase: "What number should I look at" is called interrogative phrase. Another phrase within the sentence, "I need to find the..." is called an English phrase.<n><n>### Input""I need to find the two largest odd numbers that add up to 24." What would the two numbers be?<n><n>### The best answer here is to write: "The two numbers would be 12 and 12." <n><n>### Input "I need to find two numbers with a sum of 6. That sum is 4 plus 2. What numbers can I choose?" Choices: 1+3, 2+4<n><n>### The correct phrase is 2+2. The sentence starts with an English phrase ("I need to find two...") and ends in another. "That sum is" is considered a verb phrase, as it starts with "Is" but ends in "sum" which is the name of a noun. The correct verb pair is "that sum" = "is."<n><n>### Input <n><n>### I need to multiply these

Choices:  A: violence B: falling down C: vomiting D: vomiting E: lower standards<n><n>### Response:		<n>A<n><n>### Explanation:<n>A person who gets angry after getting drink is more likely to participate in A. B is false since after getting drunk a person is not in his or her senses that is, he or she does not think rationally anymore. C is false because after getting drunk a human body releases hormone which are a chemical that makes you feel better so your vomiting hormone is a little lessened that is why D is false as well. D falls down but vomiting is also the most likely thing that may occur after drinking. This is because alcohol irritates your digestive system and may also cause dehydration which may cause you to vomit. <n><n>### Input<n>You have $75.45 and you want to buy five different items from a shop that only sells items worth 55 cents or more.

You can be spiritulally changed when you pay attention when you pray for a long time. But when you go into court you can really be spiritually changed. You can change your mind and your body and your heart. In court, you will have to tell the truth, and you get to change what you did or you are sorry as you have been told to be. And as they say, the truth shall set you free. Spiritualy speaking or not.<n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: coal or wood B: fire C: lava D: house E: solar energy<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct response to this question is fire<n><n>Fire is a common chemical reaction, which uses fuel (usually wood or coal) and oxygen to produce heat and light. This process is known as combustion and is the most common way that humans produce heat and energy.<n><n>In a fire, combustible materials (wood, coal, paper) are burned in oxygen. As the materials burn, they release heat which is absorbed by the air around it, resulting in higher temperature inside the fire. This process generates light and heat.<n><n>Lava is another common chemical reaction, but it is not used as a heat source, as it is not used as an energy source like fire. Lava is molten rock that is created from volcano eruptions and other geological events. Other differences between fire and lava include that lava does not release light or use oxygen as a fuel source, and is much hotter than fire.<n><n>Electricity can also be used to create heat, but is not considered a chemical reaction, as it does not involve a chemical reaction. Heat is produced when electrons flow between atoms in an electric current.<n><n>Heating water to produce steam is also a chemical reaction but is usually considered as a heat source and not a common chemical reaction since the heat is used to generate steam for cooking, heating, or powering machines.<n><n>Houses are also a source of heat through windows and ventilation systems that use combustion to generate heat or electricity, but this source is not considered as a common chemical reaction because it requires the presence of combustible materials such gasoline or propane and an external heat source such as natural gas or propane.<n><n>Solar energy can be used to heat up buildings and other structures, and this process can be considered as a common chemical reactions because it is a chemical reaction in itself as it involves the reaction between sunlight and the materials exposed to it, resulting in heat and light. However, this is not the most commonly used chemical reaction as heating up buildings and other structures using solar energy isn't the most common way humans produce energy.<n><n>In conclusion, the correct answer to this question is fire.<n>

One day they sell 10 percent of their products. In order to determine how many products the company produces each day, one scientist counts how many products are sold every five days. Another scientist uses the information from the first scientist to determine how many days it takes the company to produce and then stores all of the products. How many people are these two scientists?<n><n>### Response2: <n>The input does not contain enough information to identify how many people are needed in each job. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a suitable response. However, it will be determined that the company produces 10% of the manufactured products, so the people will most likely be separated into groups which will take on the job of counting the products and storing them. <n><n>## Solutions<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: examine thing B: stare into a mirror C: go somewhere D: hear news E: see favorite show<n><n>### Response:		(1) If you aren’t experiencing curiosity and you want to ensure viewing something, you may watch a news or sitcom from choice (E). (2) If you want to go somewhere, you could check choice (D). There are countless travel shows aired on major networks.<n><n>### Input.  I'm hungry and was looking for a baked good.  I’m craving something crispy and a little sweet.  I don’t mind if the butter tastes the butter.  I’m looking for something that will require utensils to eat.. Choice (1) Cookies (2) Pastrami (3) Eclair (4) Donuts (5) Cracker (6) Brownies (7) Macaroni and cheese<n><n>### Response:(1) I’d choose a nice, warm cookie that has a buttery crunch while also bringing a slight sweetness to balance out the flavors. (2) To satisfy my craving, I would eat some pastrami paired with a side dish, such as potatoes or roasted seasonal vegetables. I also would dip my pastrami in some sauce on the side to give it some extra flavor. (3) If I was looking for a sweet option, I would choose a warm eclair, and I think it would be great with my coffee in the morning. (4) A nice donut would be perfect to satisfy my craving for something crispy. (5) I could make myself a cracker with some cheese. I’d grate some cheddar and top it with some bacon, lettuce, tomato, and some mayo to bring out the flavors of the cheese. (6) To be honest, I’ve always been a big fan of brownies. I could add some walnuts or chocolate chips to add other flavors. (7) For my macaroni and cheese, I could serve it with some bread or crackers. The macaroni and chees can be a little bit on the spicier side, so I may want to dull the heat down by adding butter and a side of cucumber.<n><n>### Write a paragraph about yourself.

Choices:  A: grill B: go to market C: bring home fish D: eat hamburger E: make bread<n><n>### Response:		Your job is to use a for loop to answer this question.The grill is the best way to relieve your hungry.<n><n>### Explanation:The grill is the only option that makes sure you can do it forever without end.<n><n>### Input - This line of code asks for a string input from the program and stores it in the variable "str".<n>```<n>str = input("How do you feel during a job interview? Choices:  Excited A: scared B: nervous C: confident D: relaxed E: calm. "<n>```<n>### Response - You need to have a counter variable to count how many times the code loop repeats. Set the counter to zero and check to see if the counter is equal to zero. We need to set the break variable to true to tell the code loop to break out of the while loop when the conditional expression comes true. Add "print(str)" to print the string input that you enter.<n>```<n>counter = 0<n>str = input("Choices:  Excided A: scared B) nervous C: confident  D: relaxed E calm.

When the program sees any of these conditional statements: `if statement1 == 'True'`` and finds that these statements are either `True` or `False`, your program executes the code in the `if` statement. When a code block is written to handle a particular situation (if it happens), it is called a `conditional`.<n><n>### Q2 - The "elif" conditional statement checks the condition and then runs the code block that appears after it

One friend is 1/5 of the way through a large latte. If two of the friends ordered their lattes together, they would get 25% off. So their total cost for 2 lattes is $9. However, when they are done with the lattes, one of the friends tips the barista $0.5. How much did each of the friends save by ordering their lattes together?<n><n>Answer: $0.25<n><n>### Instructions<n><n>What is the answer to the question?<n><n>### What answer do you expect?<n><n>I think the answer is 0 because I don't think that the three friends would save any money by ordering their drinks together?<n><n>### How did you solve this?<n><n>I read over the question twice. I guessed that the three friends had to split the cost of the two lattes. The two friends who ordered lattes together would only have to pay $5 for their latte because they got 25% off, so I deducted $5 from the cost of the drinks. The one friend who wasn't with the other two friends would have to pay the rest of their latte on their own so I divided their $5 by four (because there were three friends eating together). Then I subtracted the cost of the drink when you take out the 25% discount off of that cost, and I got $0.25 from that.<n><n>### Do you agree with your answer?<n><n>Yes, because I solved it correctly and because I feel as if there isn't a right answer to this question.<n><n>##<n><n>### Instuctions<n>### The cake was for the birthdays for 7 people.

Choices:  A: walmart B: loft C: house D: home depot E: kitchen<n><n>### Response:		I would chose to go to Home Depot if I was shopping for flooring, because I would rather go somewhere that is know for hardware and appliances, rather than going to one that sells more appliances.  Also, this is more of a household item, not an item for a business, so the man would probably want to find it somewhere else.<n><n>### Input<n>What kind of tree grows more on mountainsides or in valleys?<n><n>### Response<n>I think that the tree that grows more on mountainsides is a pine tree.  I mean, there aren't many plants or trees that are able to reach higher altitudes than pine trees.  This is what I would say in my 2 minutes.<n><n>### Explanation:In my previous exercise, I wrote something similar to, "I would choose to go to Home Depots if I was buying a fridge, because it is more likely that a restaurant would need a fridge, and it is possible they won't know where to go for one, so I would recommend a trustworthy store like Home Depots to them." This exercise explains what a tree that lives in a certain environment would be, and you need to know what an environment it is living in and where the tree would live the best.<n>

You need to know how many cups to buy if 2 people will drink out of each cup.<n><n>### Response<n>The answer is 30 cups.  Because there are ten cups per person, the answer is "20/1".<n><n>### Input.<n><n>It takes Kate and her friend Sarah 30 minutes to cut down 16 trees all by themselves. How long did it take Kate and Sarah to cut down all of the trees if the number of trees they had to cut is 12?<n><n>### Response.<n><n>The answer is 20 minutes. Because there are 80 minutes of time, and 80/16 gives us 5 people. There are 5 people to do the job, which would mean it would take 10 minutes for each person.<n><n>### Your Turn:<n><n>### Input A: One company paid an additional $800 per employee per month in health insurance costs for another six months. Over these six months, the company hired 15 employees, and the additional insurance cost $420 per employee. How much did the company pay in total on health insurance during these six months?<n><n>### Input B: In a certain country there are four families. The members of the families include a mother, father, and three children. If the mother is 38 years older than her youngest child, how old is the mother’s oldest child?<n><n>### Your Response<n><n>The answer is $4,800. Because there are 6 months for health insurance, and 6/12 gives us 5 people to put in the equation. 5 people times $420 equals $2,100. $2,10 per month times 6 months equals $$12,600.<n><n>The answer to the second equation is 25 years old. 25 equals the three children minus the youngest child, but that youngest child was three years old. Then we add three years for the oldest child, then subtract 38 years. 25 minus 3 years equals 22 years.<n><n><n>### Discuss<n><n>Can you suggest

This would make the most sense in order to answer this question about the brainstorming process and how people use their minds in this way at school when they are learning about a topic or are presented with an open-ended question and how they use their minds to create new ideas that could help them solve a puzzle or come up with an appropriate response in order to show what they know about the material at hand.<n><n>Input: What is the product of 3 x 4?<n>Answer: 24<n><n>Input: What number goes into the 3rd box if all three boxes are filled up?<n>Answer: 9<n><n>Input: What do you get when you add 6 to the product of 4 and 9?<n>Answer: 72<n><n>Input: What numbers go into the same box?<n>Answer: 36<n><n>### Instructions:<n>When presented with an algebraic expression, select the correct statement to describe the expression.<n><n>### Examples:<n>Input: 12 x 20<n>Answer: A whole number<n><n>Input: 4x25-6<n>Answer: A negative number<n><n>### Response/Suggestion:If the question reads, which of the following is a whole number?

If you are looking at the expression 4x25 - 6 then the result is a negative number since the sum of the number 4 and the number 25 minus the number 6 is -14.<n>

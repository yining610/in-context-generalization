Choices:  A: laughter B: being happy C: glee D: opera E: injuries<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Different from Instructure-style Multiple Choice:<n><n>### Input/Question:<n>Input: Danny was having fun singing with his class.   He had a lot of what?  Choices: A: laughter B C: glee D E: opera F: injury<n><n>### Multiple Choice<n>A: The correct answer is C, "glee." "Injury" does not fit the sentence, because it is not an emotion expressed in the question. There are four emotion words provided. The answer "glee" fits as Danny "had a lot of" something. "Laughter" is not an emotion, so it's not applicable. "Opera" is an action, so it wouldn't work as well and would not be relevant for "had a lot of." Finally "injuries" is not an emoted feeling, so it's also a poor answer choice, and it would not fit the sentence.<n><n>### Differences:<n><n>Expected answer to be "C: glee"<n><n>### Instructor notes:<n>The word "glee" fits the sentence, but has the connotation of a strong laugh. In this case, it would be better with "gaiety." The word "glee" is also the title of a type of musical, but the question does not indicate any type of production.<n>

Choices:  A: shelf B: place of work C: desk D: office supply store E: school<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>D. A clipboard is a portable surface or tablet, and it is usually used to keep notes as you move around. Since the question is about the location where he is keeping it, which is "easily found", the correct answer is E, which means "at school".<n><n>### Input : George is writing a book. The book consists of 78,000 words.  George types two words per second.  How long will it take George to write the whole book?  Choice: A: 0 days B: 14 days C: 9 days D: More than 9 days E: Less than 9 days<n><n>### Response<n><n>D. More than 9 days, because the amount of words cannot be calculated. The amount of words required to write a book are usually expressed in terms of pages, but we can easily assume that 4 words fit on a single line, since words are much shorter than sentences, and if a line is around 15-30 words long, then each page is only 15x4=60 words, so the book requires more than 4 (78000) words, which are too much to calculate in this way.<n><n>### Input  <n>Sherry had more than 5 apples and less than 10.  How many apples does sherry have now?<n><n>### Response  <n>Four, because the number of apples cannot be calculated. A question that consists of less than 10 means that he does not know exactly the number of apples he has. Also, the less than part tells us that he must have more than 5 appples but less than 10, because the question says that he had more than 5 and less than 1. It means that, before, he had 10 apples. For us to know his new amount of apples, we need to subtract 10 from the less-than he had before, and we can say that the answer is 4 because that was the number of apples that he was left with after taking 10 apples away from his amount of apples.<n><n>###Input  <n>Craig's father asked each of Craig's five sisters to get a birthday card for him.

Use complete sentences and be sure to explain your answers. There is no minimum required length.<n><n>### Introduction<n>In the past there has been a lot of talk about the “gender bias” of programming and research studies. In 1994, there were only two female faculty hired into computer science PhD programs in the entire US (Stillwell 1996). In 2012 at the university where I am enrolled right now, less than 20% of the undergraduate students in computer science are women, and less than 15% of the graduate students working towards a Masters of Science or Ph.D. in computer science. These statistics are not far off, in fact in 2014 the National Center for Education Statistics found that 14.7% of Bachelor's degrees in computer science were awarded to women.<n><n>There have also been many reports about young women leaving computer science at higher rates than young men. For example, in 2009 just over 61% of Computer Science degree recipients were men, and just 38.9% were women. By 2010, those numbers changed to 69.7% men, and 30.3% women. Between 2007 and 2012, over 5% more men than women were enrolled in bachelor degrees in Computer Science.<n><n>In 2015, Google announced it was going to hire a female employee every week for 18 months to try and fix the gender disparity in their workforce. This move is part of Google's Project Aristotle, with the project goals being stated as: to "to ensure that great ideas can spread quickly and that we have as diverse a view of the issues as possible."<n><n>Furthermore, Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella came under fire when he commented "not having, sort of like, male and female Brainteams" at a Women at Microsoft event in May of 2014. As it turns out, about 89% of Microsoft's top executives are male (Peterson 2

Recurring every Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday from the day class starts until the first day of final exams each year, each teacher provides a final test. If the grades on those 38 exams are sorted in from highest to lowest with no more than two test scores in a row being the same, the average of a teacher’s tests will equal 85 out of a 100. Calculate the minimum number of final tests per teacher to ensure the average score on a teacher’s tests is 85 without any repeats.<n><n>### Solution<n><n>Create a recursiive function to find this score. A function will help us loop through the scores of the tests 38 times. The function needs to check if 10 scores are less than 85 out of the 22.

John would prefer a place where no animals could be witnessing abuse. He does not like the woodland, park, or a pet store, because he might run into animals while he is there. John does not want to see animals that are being harmed and he hates animal cruelty. So he would never go to the parking lot because he knows that animals are sometimes abused there. He also knows that if a farmer wants to torture animals he would do it when nobody is around. If John does not want to be close to the farmer, John would avoid going there too. John hates animal abusers and torture, so he would avoid all those places because they have those things.<n><n>### Input :Mary has two jobs and she makes $14 hour at the first job and $46 hour at the second.

Choices:  A: eat fish B: they steal C: talk to each other D: write stories E: die of starvation<n><n>### Response:		If you go to any of the poorest countries in the world like India and Pakistan and ask people if they know of any children that are starving, they most certainly will say yes. Many times as a child in those countries, there just wasn't enough food to go around. That's why many kids are malnourished, and don't have strong bones or teeth. Also, kids who have these issues often aren't able to go to school because they have to work so they can help provide food. If a family is very poor then the parents will often let their kids work with no pay so that they can make some money. Children who don't have the proper food to eat don't always do well in school, especially when the children are malnourished.<n><n>### Input-A B C D E<n><n>### Response-C<n><n>### Input :  A group of people are standing in a line and waiting for food to be given away.  There are 8 people in the line.  The line is moving, but only one of every 4 people is being given food.  In other words, if the line is 30 people long then every 4 people will get food. How many people are in the line if only every 4th person gets food?<n><n>### Response : The group of people is in line to be given food. They are in a line to get food. Since they are in line, nobody gets any food except every 4 people get food. There are 8 people and 25% of the people are going to get food which means that there is 8/25. There are 8/25 people in the line to get food, but there is nothing but 4 people in 8. That means that if there are 8 people and only 4 people are getting food, then the line is 3 people long.<n><n>### Question 1<n>### Input :<n><n>### Response<n>### <n>### Question 2<n>### Input : If a baseball game starts at 8:30, and the players need extra time before the game because the stadium is half an hour from their school, how much extra time will the players need?<n>### Response : <n>### <n><n>### Question : 3<n>### Input : Josh is 26 cm t

When she gets her drink, she asks for 40 35 30 20 25 340 2.  What did she pay for her drink?

The grocery also has on sale a 4 lb package of pork and salmon sausage for $6.99.  You have $20 but have no way to weigh either food. How do you know what food is less expensive per pound based on that information? (Note: We could say $7.99/20 and $/6.99=2.3742 pounds, in which case the pork loin would be cheaper by $2.37 a pound.  Alternatively, we could say $20-$6.99=$13.01.  If we say that each piece of sausage contains 2.35 pounds, the cost per pound for sausage is $13.01/2.35 = $5.44)  (Note: The question is referring to a food scale - a pound is 8 ounces.  You could either calculate the price per pound from the weight or from the price by finding the weight.  We do not have any other information except the numbers described.) <n><n>Another question is :  After the sale the loin weighs 5 ounces.  Each pound of sausage weighs 2.35 ounces.

So, we’re going to use panels of solar cells laminated to sheets of glass. Each sheet needs to be strong, but light, so we’ve chosen the glass we want most of all. We will build the frame using some stiff metal tubing then make sure everything is strong enough to hold the sheet and solar cells.  The panel will be attached to a metal frame attached to a car, and a car is the most cost-effective choice as the target vehicle is a Ford Model T.<n><n>We’re planning an area in the back room in the engineering department to build the solar panel.  We’ll have some tools – a soldering iron, a welder, a couple of wrenches and a drill.  You can come borrow these tools if you’d like (please make sure you mark down their locations then return them).<n><n>The materials we will be using for this project include the panels of glass, tubing, and the cells made of silicon, we'll also need lots of tools like a soldering iron and metal scraps.  We should be able to find lots of these items in the warehouse and a few things that need to be ordered but a quick inventory at the warehouse should show us what we need for this project. You could use a form to describe it on.  The following are just a few examples.<n><n>### A form:<n>The following are some of the tools and materials we’re going to be using<n><n>| **P

Choices:  A: fast food restaurant B: vegetable market C: ireland D: produce market E: dessert spot<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is produce market. The choices are fast food restaurant, vegetable market, produce market, and dessert spot. Dessert spot has nothing to do with potatoes. Ireland is a country and not a business. So if someone is looking to use potatoes in Ireland, they can go to the vegetable market. Some fast food restaurants use potatoes, like McDonalds. The vegetable market is not a business, it's an activity. So choosing A or C is incorrect.<n><n><n>### Input:"If you travel by horse 100 kilometres in five hours, <n><n>how many kilometres do you travel if your horse travels the same distance in <n><n>eleven hours?" What answer would be correct?  "The horse travels <n><n>0 kilometres"  "The horse travel 50 kilometres"  "Two <n><n>different horses travel the distance independently."<n><n>### Response:"The horse travels 0 kilometres."<n><n>### Explanation:The correct answer is that "The horse travels<n>0 kilometres" <n><n>Because 100 kilometres is 55 miles and the horse travels 55 miles in 11 hours, the horse would travel 5 miles per hour. So the horse would travel 0.9385543 kilometres.<n><n>Therefore 0 kilometres is the correct answer.<n><n><n>## Exercise 1.2.1<n><n>### Instructions:Write two example inputs followed by two responses.<n><n>### Example:<n><n>Input: The farmer harvested all of their potatoes.

The reason behind this is that, airing out helps to reduce the odor of clothes.  Other than this, airing out prevents clothes from becoming smelly.  This action is recommended by most doctors because this is the safest method to remove odor from clothes.  It is helpful because no chemicals are added to it.  In addition to this another benefit of using this action is that airing out prevents clothes to be washed again after one wash.  This action is helpful because it saves time.<n><n>### Discussion: How do you deal with smelly clothes? Do you hang them in the closet or air them out?<n><n>### Disclaimer: I chose to air out the smelly clothes because when we hang these smelly clothes in the closet for a long time these clothes develop a funny odor.

There are different types of multiple-choice questions: questions that have more than one right answer might be easier to solve or provide more practice. The next example is a multiple-choice problem solved with more than one solution.<n><n>### Example:<n>Input: The sum of two consecutive numbers is 198. What are those numbers?<n><n>Answer: $67, 69$<n>- Answer: $67$, $69$<n><n>Answer: $5, 7$<n>- Answer:  $5$, $7$<n><n>Answer:  $4, 20$<n><n>Answer: $-8644$; $-1688$<n><n><n>### Instuctions<n>Multiple choice task includes a question, where we are given multiple alternative answers to choose from.<n><n>### Solution: Example<n>Input: Which one of the following is not the sum of squares of a number?<n><n>### Solution<n>The correct answer is b.<n><n>### Rationale<n>You might be wondering why does the last answer has a negative symbol. There are two types of squares: positive squares and negative squares. Therefore, the sum of squares cannot be negative as in the last answer.<n><n>If we need to square a number, we have to apply an exponent "**2**". Therefore, we cannot apply an exponent to negative numbers.<n><n>### Next Chapter<n><n>We'll now examine an example to understand this concept.<n><n>### Input<n>Find the value of the **2** exponent to the square root of 36.<n><n>### Response<n>The square root of 30 is √30=5.893.  Therefore, the value of **2** to the square root of **36** is 5.893**2=32.286 or 32.3.<n><n>### The "sqrt" function<n>The "sqrt" function is used to calculate the square root of a number. We have to enter the number and square root operator, and we'll get the square root of the number in the result.<n><n>### Solve Example<n>Input: Find the value of ______ and solve the system of equations. 4x +

If multiple players call out bingo at the same time, the person who was the first to start saying, “BINGO,” but before any other player called out, is the winner.<n><n>### Input:(Given question(s) or problem(s):)<n><n>### Response<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Write a paragraph in response to the given question or problem.<n><n>### Demo:<n> <n>Your friend just moved out of their parent’s house to live 5 blocks away by themselves.

The world's 2 biggest countries (Canada and the United States) have decided they're going to be allies.

The good guy can see either a human which is a person of good and a different color than the alien or one of another good guy, but not a human. The evil guys only know if a good guy is within a 5 meter radius of their own eyesight, but not the colour. What is the safest and quickest way for just the evil aliens to know if any of their allies are near?<n><n>### Response:(This one’s tough)<n>Well, it seems that the evil guys are just looking for “humans” near the same color as their own. So if we find out that we are near one of them we just have to be the closest to a neutral. Then we will be safe. Then, according to the previous paragraph the safe guy is of color and if any alien looks at him, they will know we are around.<n><n>### Input (This one is also good)<n><n>The numbers that you entered are not a correct time for the end of the day.

The faces have 2/3 empty spaces. This leaves 6*(2/3) = 4 empty spaces inside the cube and 6*(1/3) = 2 cubes of water. A cubed of ice weighs 9.9/10 of its volume of water. Therefore it will weigh 9.9/4 = 2.45.<n>Another way of working it out is: 4*(1/3) will be all the water outside (2 cubes), 3*(2/3) will be the water inside the cube (4.5 cubes), and 1/3 of that will be water (1.5 cups). Therefore the total weight of ice on the cube will be 9.9*6 + 1.5 = 2.54 cups of water.<n><n>### Your computer’s hard drive has a capacity to hold 500 billion bytes of data.

The prototype includes the ability to manipulate shapes and objects, but it is not known if this could have been developed into a full game.<n>* The game was received favorably by most critics: it scored a 67/100 on Metacritic and got critic approval on Just RPG, giving it an "Almost Great" score. On the website The Digital Fix, though, the game received a 10/100, with the critic noting it was "pretty much the worst game imaginable".<n>* On GameSpot.com, the game received a positive reception. It gave it a 6.7/10 review saying, "Like a good math problem that's not too hard, Mathematica! offers a simple, yet highly challenging alternative to the norm that isn't boring." A review on AllGame rated the game 3 out of 5 stars. On GameStats, the game has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 2 reviews.<n><n>## External links<n><n>* Mathematica! at MobyGames<n>* Mathematica!

Choices:  (A) 10 hours (B) 4 hours (C) 2 hours (D) 8 hours (E) 1 hour<n><n>### ResponseAnswer the given multiple-choice question. Show your reasoning.<n><n>#### Answer<n><n>C<n>When Sam begins driving, let time=t and elevation=e.<n>We see that the formula to find time is time = e / 40 + 86.  Sam will need 86 minutes to get to 286 meters.  Sam will need to do 1 hour /286 for 1.01365121408302598 minutes.  That is 1 hour and 7 minutes.  When Sam begins he is already at 286 meters so he adds 286-0=286 to the formula for time to get time=e/40+286.  Sam is driving at 40 KPH but the time to travel 286 meters is really 300 meters.  Sam's formula for time is time=((286+300)/40)+86.  Sam's final answer is 2 hours and 7 minutes.<n><n>### ResponseIf Sam needs to drive a distance of 842 meters, how many hours will he need to get there while speeding at an average speed of 114 kilometers per hour? Choices: (A) 4 hours and 7 minutes (B) 3 hours (C) 5 hours and 4 minutes (D) 3 hours and 8

Choices:  A: tiredness B: grogginess C: discomfort D: getting out of bed E: eyes opening<n><n>### Response:		Discomfort<n><n>### Justify your answer:The question asks what was happening to Bill, which refers to Bill's physiological state, not his mental state. As a result, it is clear that he is not awaking in a mental state of getting out of bed, and would not describe himself getting up like that. If he was tired, he would know it. He would feel it, he would feel grogginess. He is not feeling grogginess; he is only feeling that he is not in a good physiological state.<n><n>Bill is awaking from sleep. He is discontent with his physiological state, but not in any particular way. In fact, he can describe it with one word, "discomfort". Given this, "grogginess" would not be possible, because it describes a certain state of mind rather than a state of physique. "Grogginess" implies that he's feeling tired, but the question explicitly asked if he was awake in his sleep. If he was in deep sleep, he would not be experiencing tiredness or grogginess, he would simply be awaking.<n><n>### Input:"I went to the movie with my friends and got some snacks and popcorn." What was the main purpose for your action described above?<n><n>### Demostration:My friends and I went to a movie. We got some snacks and then we got some popcorn.<n><n>### Response:"I was socializing with my friends."<n><n>### Justfiy your answer:The stated reason was "I went to the movie". The question did not ask about why they went to the movie, but about your own motives. If the group went to the movie to socialize, then it's not you who's going there to socialize. What we know about the group's motive tells us that they went there to watch a movie. The question asks about your motive. It does not mention any more information about the group's reason for going to the movie. That should not affect your answer.<n><n>The question could have been phrased, "Was your primary reason to get some snacks?" But the phrase "the main purpose" already strongly suggests a single overarching reason for the whole event. That would explain why the author chose to use "the entire purpose" instead of another phrase with similar meaning

Choices:  A: public place B: roadblock C: space shuttle D: hoverboard E: supermarket<n><n>### Response:		Space shuttles would be nice, but people would still want to go to a public place while in space.<n><n>### Input:"If you are walking two miles in 30 minutes and you are traveling at 2 miles per hour, if you were 17 miles from your destination for 20 minutes, how long would it take to reach your destination?"<n><n>### Response:"It would take you 70 minutes to walk from where you started to your destination."<n><n>### Conclusion:If you are walking two and a half miles in thirty minutes, and you are traveling 35 miles per hour, if this is true, it would take you 54 hours to reach your destination. I'm pretty sure though that it will take you more than a whole day to get to your destination.

Also, it will not be possible to travel in outer space and travel from one planet to another.<n><n>### Explanation:There are two types of people who want to explore space. Space engineers will try to get astronauts to explore the moon if they want to do it. If they want to explore the universe, they will need to use space shuttles.<n><n>### Continuation:People want to go to space in order to not be bored by looking at earth. In order to explore space, they need both space shuttles and spaceports. Some places like the moon, Mars, and venus are far from earth.<n><n>### Restriction:Restriction: You can't really explore all places because they are far away from earth. It would take hours before people can walk from earth to the moon, if not the whole day. I haven't tried the moon and I never will know how long it will take me to get to the moon.<n><n>### Requirement:Requirement: People will need to have a space shuttles to be able to travel to space.<n><n>## Assessment:<n><n>In this example, I need to assess people who want to travel in space for the

It wouldn't be smart or safe to build a structure at the top of a hill with a very weak foundation because the hill might not support all the weight. The hill may settle and collapse over time.<n><n>The first step of construction is usually choosing a suitable location for the building. Archaeological sites must be avoided. Graves and ruins should not be disturbed. There is a risk of damaging the foundations and relics during the excavation. A builder should be careful not to disturb a site that belongs to someone else since this could ruin an important piece of history.<n><n>If the property is in a cemetery, the person building there would be the one to ask permission from the head of the cemetery. Cemetery burials, such as graves and other sites, should not be disturbed because it is important to keep evidence of culture's past, especially if someone is not buried properly.<n><n>### Input<n>Choose a math word problem from the list below and write the answer in the box.<n>Choose A, B, C, or D

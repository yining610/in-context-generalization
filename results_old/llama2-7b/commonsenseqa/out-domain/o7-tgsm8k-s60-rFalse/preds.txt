In 1.3.3, all numbers are less than 32, so 31 is always a possibility. The first sentence implies the total is greater than 10 but less than 15. So the only options are 11, 12, or 13.

The goal is to understand the concepts at work and to know what your program did to arrive at a specific result.<n><n>*Note: If you get stuck, you can look at the full code in the project files.*<n><n>### Requirements:<n><n>* Only integer values are accepted.<n>* You may not use any globals/shared variables/classes/etc.<n>* The input data is not guaranteed to be valid.<n><n>---<n><n>In the code, I need to calculate which direction I should turn based on how far North I am<n><n>### Input Format:<n><n>*Number in the format of miles*<n><n>----<n><n>### Output Format:<n><n>*The word north or south*<n><n>### Sample Input:<n><n>*230*<n><n>----<n>### Sample Output:<n><n>*The letter n, indicating North.*<n><n>--------<n><n>## Notes:<n><n>*Note: In this project. We will use if statements, to use them correctly. First thing you will need to do, is indent the statements for the block of logic you are about to write. If you indent properly, your code is easier to read. So you may want to take a look at your own code and make sure its properly indented.<n><n>*Note 2: When developing, it helps to create a few variables so you can get code working with less repetition by just updating one variable.<n><n>### Test Cases:<n><n>I need to create 3 test cases, each for one of the programs written. A single test case for each program for me to test.<n><n>*Please note that any 3 test cases will do so long as you test for inputs, outputs, and logic.<n><n>### Grading:<n><n>The code should have no bugs. Any incorrect answer or bug (e.g., you forgot to add a parenthesis) will result in a grade of 0.

Choices:  A: under bed B: symphony C: music room D: band practice E: music store<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>---<n><n>I recommend you store your instrument(s) in the music room or band practice. They both ensure that the people who come to your house get the chance to play your instruments. As you play in front of others, you will be more inclined to keep your instruments working and well-tuned. Additionally, the sound of a musician practicing (in your music room) can inspire someone else to pick up an instrument. On the other hand, putting your instruments in the bed, or under it, can make the sounds travel to other rooms and disturb your sleep. Or at least, the sound of tuning will wake you up every day. Similarly, if you put your instruments in a store, you may not end up playing it at all. Music stores are crowded, especially during peak hours (between 10AM to 2PM). The instruments are rarely being played.<n><n><img src="https://github.com/t0mmywang/Rush-to-solve-mathematics-problems/blob/main/images/solution302.png" alt="solution302"><n><n>---<n><n>### Input<n><n>22 x 24 = _____<n><n>### Response<n><n>---<n><n>22 x (24 - 1) = 22 x 23 = 532.<n><n><img class="w-96 mx-auto align-middle" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=t0mmyw.wang&repo=math-problem-solving&color=ff5555" /><n>

Choices:  A: tiredness B: living longer C: stomach ache D: illness E: acid reflux<n><n>### Response:		<n>Please provide the correct answer. If there are other correct answers that should be listed here, please send a pull request with those answers added (and the instructions updated) after your acceptance.<n><n>### Examples<n>#### A:<n>A child's growth depends on two factors: the nutrients in food and the amount of exercise the child gets. Nutrients in food and exercise are like water and air. In order for a plant to grow properly, the plant needs both water and air. In the same way, a child must get both nutritious food and exercise in order to grow.<n><n>Growth depends on both nutritious food (water) and getting enough exercise (air). A child who drinks milk and eats green leafy vegetables and fruit will not likely grow as tall as a child who eats foods that have little or no nutritious value. But a child who drinks milk, eats healthy foods, and gets regular exercise will probably be healthy and grow as tall as possible.<n><n>#### B:<n>Exercising and eating the right foods are the best ways to be healthy and fit. If a child is not able to do at least one hour of exercise daily, that child should talk to a parent or the teacher about eating nutritious snacks, such as fruits and vegetables.<n><n>Too much food or too little exercise can result in being overweight, becoming sick, or developing a heart condition. If the parent thinks there is a medical problem, then the doctor needs to be told about a child's weight problem.<n><n>#### C:<n>If you eat too much dinner, you will get acid reflux. This is very painful and not to be enjoyed.<n><n>#### D:<n>If you eat to much dinner, you will gain weight. When you have too much food in your stomach, it backs up. So you have more acid in your stomach than you can handle. So eating too much dinner causes you to get sick. You get an upset stomach, feel bad, and eat some more. So you get sick again. So by the time you are feeling like the normal, happy happy you, you've gained a lot of weight.<n><n>#### E:<n>If you eat more food then your body can handle, it will cause gastritis. Gastritis is very

Choices:  A: weak B: fragile C: forceless D: regular E: flimsy<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Answer:<n>Regular - The answer is regular. <n><n>Explanation:<n><n>The answer is correct because regular glass is not treated to be extra strong. Instead, it is designed to be extra resistant to everyday use.<n><n>If glass was weaker, the manufacturer would call it fragile, and if it was less stiff and strong than regular glass, it would be called flimsy.<n><n>The answer is no because the glass is not extra forceless. Forceless is the opposite of stiff<n><n>If we were to use the word forceless to describe glass, we would describe weak glass, which we just said was incorrect. A forceless quality that is the opposite of sturdy.<n><n>Glass that has been treated to be especially resistant is known as extra strength glass. It is thicker and stiffer.<n><n>A sturdy one is a strong one.<n><n>Answer B:<n>The answer is no. Strength is one word because glass is sturdy. But fragile is not a word for an attribute because it is a word that tells us that a thing can easily be broken.<n><n>Answer C:<n>The answer is correct. The term for glass that hasn't been strengthened for use is weak. Glass that has been strengthened for use to resist breaks is termed sturdy.<n>   <n>Answer D:<n>No, the answer is incorrect. The word regular does not mean the same thing as the word weak. And glass is not flimsy.<n>

Choices:  A: neighbor's house B: bridge C: home D: homeless shelter E: prison<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>**D** The best answer is D (Homeless shelter). Jimmy's wife is an alcoholic on Probation. She can't be trusted to stay in your house and have a beer. Your kids might run in when she is on the other side of the bridge. And you don't want her to go to jail for drinking. You are probably better off not lending her your key to your house.  <n><n>In an alcoholics on probation, they are not trusted to drink, and they are not trusted with leaving home.  A home is the last place you'd want to leave your wife when she's on probation.<n>And if she's on probabtion, she is also on probation. You'd have a hard time trusting her not to drink. It is better for you to take her to a homeless shelter, or even a church. <n><n>In an alcohlic on probation, they have a harder time trusting others, and with themselves. If someone is an alcoholic, it is best for them to drink alone, and not around children.<n><n>

Then solve the second expression.<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>Let’s take the first expression first. For every 13 (5 + 5 x 6 - 4 x 7) one is to get the result 13 times (5 add 5 times 6 less 4 times 7 5 + 24 + 16 - 28 24+28 – 24 = 6 less 23 – x – y 20 = x. X = 55. So let's solve it we have that now. We have 6 and 20 and it's plus 14. So six plus 24 plus 14 fourteen we can divide by two 41/2 is ten. Divide by 24 4/24 x 3 is 12. 12 times 2 and 28 x 2 is 56. So our answer 57 times 2 = 114.<n><n>Let's try the second one. For every 16 minus the 13, it's going to be 3 less than 29, less 11 is negative 18.<n><n>I wrote negative because that's what the answer is negative 18, we have 16 negative 18 or let's look at it. It is 16 is minus 18. It means we have 2 and negative 2 and minus 2 equals 2. We can substitute it in our original. It is equal 19 minus 11.<n><n>Subtract 13, we're back to the first one. Let's just look at it, the 11 is the less 6. Then we get 16.<n><n>### Summary<n><n>The first equation: The variables are equal to the first equation.<n><n>The

Choices:  A: infect B: reproduce C: mutate D: eat food E: make computer malfunction<n><n>### Response:		Which of the 5 choices is correct?<n><n><details><summary>Response A: infect</summary><n>A virus primarily does to a person infect. A virus is a type of infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. This is a key difference between viruses and other pathogens like prions, though the lines between these are sometimes blurred. In most cases, the host does not live a healthy, full life as long as it is carrying the virus. There are many diseases associated with particular viruses, and these diseases can spread in different ways. Some examples of viruses and the diseases they are associated with include:<n><n><details><Summary>Pulmonary edema<n><n>* Viruses that can cause pulmonary edema are: cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parainfluenza virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and other human immunodeficiency viruses.<n><n></summary></Details><n><details><Summary></Summary></Details><n><center><n><figure style="width: 700px; display: inline-block;"><n><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Medley_of_viruses_under_electron_microscope.jpg/1200px-Medley_of_Viruses_under_electric_microscop.jpg" alt="Medley of Viruses Under Electron Microscope" width="300"/><n></figure><n></center><n></Details><n></details><details><summary>Response B: reproduce</summary><n>Viruses multiply by themselves in the cells they have invaded. This multiplication is called reproduction and it happens mainly in the cells of the victim's body. A virus can multiply only after the entry of a virus into a new organism. Viruses often cause illness by damaging organisms or preventing the growth and development of the host. Viruses, unlike mammals, grow by replication, a simple process that dupes a small section of the DNA to give new viruses with the same pattern. A virus's genome is a genetic code that tells the cell what to do. This process of replication happens millions

Choices:  A: rain forest B: research laboratory C: cage D: treetops E: south africa<n><n>### Response:		<n>The only choices that would make sense are D and E. The choices of C,  A,  B, and are not even close. A rain forest and laboratory are not the same because they are not even close to one another. A, B, and C are not even close to being the same place too. Monkeys are not even close to the choices of A, B, or C. Monkeys are from Africa. So they wouldn’t be taken somewhere such as South Africa because it is in Africa. And also, there is no Cage in The Rain Forest. And if it is taken to a Rain Forest, It would not be brought to a laboratory. A monkey does not like that stuff. People do not always take wild animals from their homes. So why would they take monkeys from their home to a Cage or Rain Forest?<n>

Choice: A) July B) March C) June D) May E) February<n><n>- The correct answer is C) June<n>- This question is related to an example task where they were asked:Input: Janet has +32 less than 112. Brenda has 6 times more +41 than Janet. Mara has 2 times as much -11 as Janet. How much more -53 is Mara's -5 times Mara's Brenda answer.<n>- In the example task, Mara answered with -53. If Mara answered with -4 times her Brenda answer, which will be +2052, then it would be logical that -4 times +41(Brenda's answer) would be -1644, and thus in order to answer the question correctly, Mara should have answered -53, and not -4 times her Brendas answer.<n>- A possible solution is:<n><n>Let m be "Mara's answer"<n>- Let b be "Brenda's answer"<n><n>So:<n>(1) m >= 2*b<n>- which means that:<n>m <= -2*b<n>- Let S: -4*b = m<n>- or: 4*b = m + 2<n>- so: b = (m+2)/4<n>- from which follows:<n>m = -2*b + 2<n>- and: m = -2*(-b+2) + 2<n>- which means that<n>m = -3*b + 5<n>[1]<n>- and: m - 4 = -3*b - 4<n><n>- so: m - 4 + 3*b - 3*b = 5<n><n>- which means that if we multiply m - 4 +3*b by 3,

It is the first sentence that gives the writer’s point of view on the topic; thus, it is often given a commanding tone. The topic sentence is followed by a colon (:), and there should be at least 2 transition(s) included.<n><n>#### Supporting sentences<n>Supporting sentences are the sentences that include the supporting topic, that is, they talk about how one can support the topic sentence by using their main idea. It starts with a blank line and a dash(-).<n><n><n>#### Transition<n>A transition is the sentences that are used to connect sentences and paragraphs.  It is a sign that one paragraph is connected to another.  It contains the words to make the sentence look smooth and clear so readers can follow smoothly.<n><n>#### Conclusion<n>A conclusion is the last sentence that ties up all sentences that are written before it. It is also the sentence that brings to a close of the paragraph. It contains the words such as 'lastly' and its kind. 'Lastly' can be used only in the last sentence but its meaning is the same as 'in conclusion'.<n><n>#### Grammar<n>The grammar used in a paragraph includes the sentence structure, grammar such as verb, and sentence format. It might be easy to format the basic structure of a paragraph. But do not forget to check all the necessary sentence structure such as noun, pronoun, and verb.<n><n>#### Example<n><n>```<n><i>The topic sentence is the first sentence that establishes the main idea of the paragraph; and it’s followed by

Too similar that we can call them close cousins on the evolutionary scale. When I was growing up my parents encouraged me to wash my hands. A lot. My parents were scared of my catching something from another child at school, a child that may have touched something infected with a virus and passed it on to me. A virus is tiny enough to get through small holes and poke into your skin. This is how an infection from a bacteria, or virus like, disease is caused. Once in your system the pathogen needs a good source of protein to replicate. That is why you are told to eat a good diet. A diet which contains a good amount of protein. Viruses are so small that they have no energy source of their own. They need a place to reproduce and grow. That is why viruses only cause infection from cells and tissues in the body that contain protein to replicate after it is attached to the cell itself. That is why you get sick everytime you are sick.

{"text": "Place the shed in backyard, keeping things in.\n\n### Detailed solution:\nThe correct choice is \"keeping things in\". That is the place where you store things. The other terms aren't clear, they aren't used consistently. For example, \"next to the house\" doesn't really explain where \"the house\" is. If \"house\" is by itself, where is it? And why put it next to the shed? \"Ranch\" isn't really a type of location in a city. Also, \"ranch\" could mean the area where cows live.\n\n### Input\nChoices: A: next to the car B: parking space C: driveway D: on the property line\n\n### Response\nPlace it in the driveway\n\n### Solution:\nThe second choice here would probably be \"on the property line\". However, I chose \"on the property line\" since this term is used in the second choice, so we have more contextual information. The definition of parking space in a parking garage also isn't clear. That's why a driveway may be the \"correct\" choice.\n\n### Chooses: Choices: A: front yard B: backyard C: right side of house D: left side of house\n\n### Response :\nPlace the shed in front yard. The reason is that I feel that it describes a front yard the most precisely out of the given answers.\n\n### Solution\nI think that the question asks where to put the shed, and the answers the question asks is about where the house is. \"Front yard\" describes the yard in front (before the house), and that would be considered a front yard. Therefore, the correct answer is \"front yard\", however as I said above, there may be some ambiguity in the question.", "answer": "C: backyard"}

For example, what if they ask how to write a loop in Java or Perl? What if they ask what is a class or a variable?\n\n### How do we get to the answer?\n\nLet's look at this problem from a different point of view: How do we get the answer?\n\n### 1) Divide and Conquer: The first thing to notice is that this problem can be solved in two ways: divide or conquer.\n\n### 2) Divide: If we divide it, then we have two problems: How many people are on the plane and how many seats on the plane.  If we look closely at the second part, it says \"and have every seat taken\". Therefore it means there are exactly **two less people** than there are seats.  Thus, the second part is a single person short.\n\n### So we have a two person problem.\n\n## What if they asked for something more complicated?\n\nAnswer:\n1.\n\n### We use two people to do the problem for us. How big are the two seating areas we have to fill?\n\n### We have **two times as many seats as people**.\n\n### Let's say we have \\(n\\) as the number of seats and \\(p\\) as the number of passengers.

I wish I could help her buy it since my brother has a stork, that will surely give her a lot of babies.\n\n### Response\uff1aDon't help her buy a baby carriage as it's easy for baby to break or get dirty. If you still want to help your sister, you may as well take a baby stroller to give to her since it is more durable.\n\n### Output\uff1aMy sister-in-law wants to buy a car but she has less money. My husband said she should find a car dealer that can offer her a loan. But then my father told him off saying that if she borrowed money for the car, she should have to pay interest and that's what you don't want to have.\n\n### Problem\n\nIt seems that my brother and his wife (my sister-in-law) live a luxurious life and I think that they should get a taste of the difficult life that we have. But then I realize that they may not know how to save money and my husband decided to go and tell him about this. He was right. My sister-in-law said she always wants to buy a car, and we have to admit that you really can't get many things without having it. So my husband suggested that she should find herself a car dealer that she can borrow money from there and buy the car afterward. The dealer will loan a total of $370,000 to a number that is a third less than the total. My father told my brother not to let her do this. But my brother can't do what his father said since most people like to have a car and it's a must have nowadays. But then my father thinks that borrowing money is risky and they may need to pay a lot of interest to the bank. But then we all realized that this may seem like a big threat to both of them. Since my brother can't keep his promise, maybe he should just buy a small car for her to use while paying off the loan from the bank.", "answer": "B: wet ground"}

By the time the second car arrives, it is about 20m away from you. It is unlikely you'd be able to tell how far away by your knowledge of the two cars' speeds, but it is known that the first car is 50m further away from where you are standing.\n\n### Explanation:\n```\nvar speed1 = 10; // (10m in 20s)\nvar start1time = 20; // (", "answer": "E: falling down"}

{"text": "Choice E\n\n### Input and Response:\nChoices are:\n\nInput: This is a good year for sales. This increased profit was not achieved by increasing salaries. It was achieved by increasing sales volume. What was the effect on profit? Choices:  a. increase the net income by an equal percentage as sales increase. b. the profit margin is higher with greater business volume. c. the percentage profit margin was the same for the whole year. d. profit increased more evenly throughout.\n\nResponse: Choice B. If sales increased by 10%, the increase in profit would have to increase by even more than the sales increase, that is, by 10%+10% = 20% to maintain the profit margin percentage at same value. However, if the sales increase is 10% and the profit increase is 15%, the profit margin percentage has actually increased by 15%+10%  = 25%, showing that greater sales volume actually increases profit margin percentage more than that of the sales increase. So it is choice B.\n\n### Inputs: The store manager says that the store is doing well. He is sure that this is because of the new products they are selling.

Choices:  yes they will definitely have a positive effect on business.  no they will only have a temporary positive effect on business.\n\n### Response\n\nYes they will definitely have a negative impact on business.\n\nIf sales increase by 10%, then with the same cost structure (expenses, such as cost of goods and expenses, salaries, etc.), the increase in profit from incremental sales would have to be more than 10% in order to maintain the pre-increase profit margin percentage, that is, 10%*10% = 100% of the existing profit margin percentage.

{"text": "walk slowly\n\n#### Solution:\nHe could not run. So he could move only by walking.\n\n### Input \nThe farmer can grow 80 tomato plants in an 18 square\nfoot plot. Planting the seedlings and caring for them takes a further 12 square feet. If the rest of the plot has to be fenced for safety\nwhat will be the total cost the farmer pays?\n\n### Response (incorrect):$137.28\n\n#### Solution:  The total footage for the garden = 18+12 = 30.\n\nIn 30 square feet, 80 * 80/30 = 240/30 plants are in the plot.\n\nFencing takes an area of 64/30 = 16 square feet \n\nTherefore, 240/16 = 15 plants are left to fence.\n\nThe cost to fence 15 plants will therefore be $3.75 + (15/4) * $0.20,\n\nTherefore, the total cost would be $3.76 + (15/2) * $0.30 \n\n= $4 +25/2  = $2.25.\n\n### Example:\nA person drives 60 miles during a week using 13 gallons of gas per time, what is the cost of the gas?\nAnswer: 0.4625\n\n#### Solution: The gas cost will be = (13 * 60) / 5.3\n\nwhich reduces to 46.25.", "answer": "C: walking"}

{"text": "A\n\nInput: What is the correct result of losing weight?\n\nThe answer is A \"Increased energy.\"  To lose weight, which most of us want to do, one needs to exercise.  When a person is out of shape, he often can't do the amount of exercise required to lose weight, because he doesn't have enough energy to do it.  The best exercise is walking or aerobics. For this to be done in a safe manner, one must get their blood to move through the body, supplying a person with more oxygen.  That way, they'll be going at it much more efficiently and gain more energy with their walk.  For people that weigh over 100 pounds, that is a good result.\n\n### Input-2 How much does 6 gallons of gas cost?

The adult Glossina tsetse is usually black, grey, brown or red-brown and winged but has six eyes as well as the more usual four. The females are sexually mature at six weeks and have a life span of approximately one year. The females do not die without reproducing and produce around 4,000 eggs during their lifetime.

{"text": "The wind tore the roof's shingles, what is the wind like?  \n\nThe shingle is a protective material made of various composite materials used as roofing.  In other words, a shingle is a roof in a sheet.  The words'shingles' and'shake' are commonly confused.  A shingle is a rectangle-shaped piece of material nailed to create a grip.  A shake (also called a shingle), on the other hand, is a rectangular lumber plank that has been split into two thin pieces.  \n\nThe wind took off the roof's shapely edges, what is the wind doing?\n\nWind speed is a parameter used in meteorography to describe the rate at which air molecules are moving in a specific volume of space.  A wind measurement is commonly represented by speed, or the size and direction of the air movement, as well as other variables such as barometric pressure and humidity.  The wind speed can be recorded using instruments such as an anemometer or a sonic or laser anemometer.  A common unit of measurement is kilometers per hour (km / h), where one kilometer is equal to 100 meters.  \n\nIn meteorology, wind speed is most often measured using an anemometer.  In particular, sonic or laser Doppler anemometers are capable of detecting wind speed without a moving source using the Doppler Effect.  Using sound or beams, these instruments capture the wind speed and direction.  A sound anemometer measures sound speed on a sound path by measuring the difference in sound waves emitted from different points in the air.  An electronic device creates this sound and, due to the Doppler effect, the device detects the difference in sound speed and direction (and thus the wind speed and direction).  Doppler beams use ultraviolet reflectors to measure and create beams of radiation which then detect the Doppler effect to measure wind direction and speed.  When wind passes through the Doppler source, these beams change direction and speed, causing the receiver to calculate the speed and direction of the wind.  In addition, laser Doppler wind speed devices use laser light paths to measure the velocity of wind using the Doppler effect.  The laser light reflects back", "answer": "C: blowing hard"}
{"text": "The Great Michigan Lakes:\nThis is a classic problem where you use the knowledge of the great lakes to correctly guess what the answer is. First, I think we need to list out the options and make some observations about them. So, we need to decide which of the following options can't be it:\n* Great Michigan Lakes contains 3 words, but the clue gives us that it can be plural (and we already know that it is a noun as we haven't identified the noun). So, it cannot contain the words \"great\" or \"lakes\".\n* There cannot be more than two words with \"Michigan\" as they are all different. So, \"Michigan\" and \"Lake superior\" are out.\n* The clue tells us that the name has only one place of punctuation. However, we know that all the options could have more than one place of punctuations (as they come as a list).\n* Michigan can only have one Michigan in it. So, \"Michgan\" and \"michigan\" are out.\n\nAfter this, there are only two things that are obvious and they reduce the number of options left:\n* \"Suddenly\" shows that only one of the options will require one word to be plural (i.e. is not plural already). Thus, we are reduced to only \"great\" and \"Mighigan\" with \"Mighigan\" being definitely out.\n* \"underwater\" is a different word than the others. Thus, if the others end with \"water\", underwater would need a different ending, i.e. \"underwater\" would be wrong.\n\nLet us discuss whether we have all the options with a \"water\" end:\n* \"aquarium\" can't be the proper noun.\n* \"lake superior\" contains lake superior and, most importantly is a compound word. So, it can't be the response.\n\nAt this point, in the remaining options, \"pond\" cannot have more than one pond or it should not end with \"pond\". However, we have seen that \"pond\" is not a proper noun. Thus, we rule out \"pond\" as an answer. Thus, we are left with the following:\n* \"Lake\" starts with \"L\" and only ends with \"K\" and not \"M\". Thus", "answer": "D: lake superior"}

Then use elimination to solve for a and b. \n\n### Solution A = \n\nWe want the sum of the two expressions to be $0.60, or $60\u00f72.\n  \nB = 60\u00f72. We can find the unknown $q$ by multiplying B and A to get the equation q \u00d7 60\u00f72 + r = 60. From there, simplify to get 3q + r = 30.\n  \nSubtract r from both sides to get 3q = 20. Solving for q, which we can then substitute. A = 20 \u00d7 q + r. Eliminate r by rearranging as follows:\n\n### Solution B =\n\nTo solve, we first substitute q = 10 by multiplying B by 10: B \u00d7 10 = 60.

(B) By using Newton's first law, in which a stationary observer and moving observer each have a constant velocity with respect to the light that is emitted.

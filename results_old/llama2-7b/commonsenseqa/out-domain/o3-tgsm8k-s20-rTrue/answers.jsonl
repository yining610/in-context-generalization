{"text": "Choice C: death and decay.\n\n### Input Choice A: sleeping longer:\nSleep is a restful, necessary, and natural process. It relieves stress and allows our bodies and minds to re-energize and repair. The brain\u2019s electrical activity switches into a slow-wave sleep mode as muscles relax and heart rate and blood pressure drop. The natural progression of sleep takes us through all these stages as the night progresses. It\u2019s typical to sleep more at the end of the first part of the night. The average length of sleep for healthy young adults is about 7 hours.\n\n### Response Choice A: sleep\n\n### Input A: getting colder:\nWhen we sleep, our bodies produce less of the body hormone prolactin. Prolactin keeps us feeling warm by keeping our sweat glands active. If we lose enough prolactin, we lose our ability to sweat. We also lose the ability to keep our muscles warm. After all, we cannot easily move while we are sleeping. Together these two factors make us feel colder while we sleep. When we get to the REM cycles, our muscles twitch and jerk and may result in cramping. The twitching also may be associated with coldness.\n\n### B: Dying and Decay:\nYour body\u2019s cells are constantly dying and regenerating, a process called \u201ccell replacement.\u201d Most cells die off and are replaced every month or two\u2014only some such as brain cells die much more slowly and don\u2019t regenerate as quickly.\n\n### C: Change of Color:\nAs you get older, some cells stop producing sufficient amounts of melanin to protect your skin. A sunscreen helps, but aging skin eventually becomes more vulnerable.\n\n### E: Stop breathing:\nWe spend, on average, one-third of our life asleep \u2013 and a third of that time is lost breathing. Breathing patterns differ between REM and non-REM cycles. While we are in REM sleep, we almost completely stop breathing while a deep stage of non-REM sleep takes over. It is estimated that we take about ten breaths a minute in REM sleep, the deepest stage we experience, in comparison with the 12 to 20 breath", "answer": "B: getting cold"}

AM time = 12:12 AM, which equals 00:12 AM\n24 Hour PM Time = 12:05 PM, which equals 02:05 PM\n\nTherefore, the time shown in 24 hour format is:\n(H + the total of M and S) mod 60 = AM or PM\n\nIn this case, (11+120+20) % 60 = 20 = 1:12 PM", "answer": "C: plain"}

There were 5,000 more residents over last year. The new total number of residents is 605,000. What year?\n\n### Answer:\nThe correct answer was 2015.\n\n### Rationale:\n600,050 - 600,xxx = 5000\nLet x mean the year: 600,xxxx\nThe year was the last one of the decade.\nSince 20x = y is true for x and y, x = 2015, the last year of the decade\n\n### Input 2:\nIn the year when it snowed, it was the coldest the last 7 years. The total number of days that the school bus did not run the last 5 years was 420. The new total number days that the bus did not run the current school year is 315. What is the year that it snowed the coldest in the last 7 years?(The first time that it snowed was last school year, when the total number of days the bus did not run was 360)\n\n### Answer 2:\nThe correct answer, given the following:\n\nThe school bus did not run for 5 consecutive days last December, as there was 12 feet of snow. It was colder the previous December (when there was 3 inches of snow), as the total number of days that they did not run was 5 (last year the temperature was 5 degrees warmer than this year). The first time that snow was encountered was in 2014, when the school bus did not work for 6 days.\n\nThe question was:\n7 years ago (12 years - 5 years) = 7 years\n\nLast year that it snowed and how many days the bus did not work was 12, so last year, the year that it snow the most was not the last 7 years ago.\n\nThe school bus was stopped for 29 days last December, meaning last Dec's the coldest in", "answer": "A: villa"}

(E) This is why parents should control their children since they can dictate how they should behave as well as control how they use their time.

They have already eaten there and are looking for something else.

An archaeological is different from building construction and cemetery burial because it focuses on digging up and studying artifacts of human civilizations of the past. Burial grounds are a location where corpses are stored underground, usually after a funeral. Excavations that occur near buildings can damage infrastructure if they are not performed carefully, making buildings dangerous for people to occupy and potentially resulting in severe property damage, injuries, and death.

The result was 0 since drouth does not divide the pool\n\nthen asked where it was located, i checked all the answers and saw that they did not result in 0, so that they would not be refilled due to the drouth regualtations\n\n\n#### Detailed Rationales:\nA) ymca - Since there is more water at the beach that drought regultions don't even apply in\nB) Calfornia D) Park - Not refilled due to drout regulations\nE) School - not refilled due to the lack of water from drout regalaions", "answer": "B: california"}

It is obvious that Jenny also ate more noodles than Shan over the period of dinner, but it is not so obvious that Jenny also spent more on noodles than Shann.\n\n### Rationales: Jenny may spend more because she ate more. However, her budget may be the same. Let x be the total number of dollars Jenny spent for groceries.\nJenny ate y more units of noodles than Shane.\nJenny spent $z per unit of noodles.\nNow, we have these two equations:\ny * z = all the noodles Jenny ate.\ny * $z = all the noodle money Jenny spent.\nSubtracting y * $z from both sides, we can see that\n$z - y * $z = $y, the total amount of noodles Jenny spent\nDivide both sides by $z and we can see that y / $z = $y.\nLetting r be the ratio of the noodles Jenry purchased, we get\n$y = $z * r, which means Jenny's ratio purchase of noodles = $z / $y\nNow, we know Jenny also ate y more units than Shane, and Jenny spend $r more dollars for each unit than Shane did.\nSo, Jenny's ratio of dollars to noodles = $r * $y / r = $y.\nJenny bought y more noodles for the same amount of dollars.

{"text": "The correct answer is \"E\" or \"falling down.\" A bike ride may be hard, but also may be enjoyable (pleasure), or a bike may have an accident (accident) or it can help one reach a destination (get somewhere) or one can be hurt (hurt). Yet none of those options can be the answer to the riddle. This response can be found with the statement that a bike can hurt one. The question is specifically asking which answer fits with \"riding bike through rough terrain\" implying getting hurt. Only the answer \"falling down\" matches both the wording of the riddle and the logic of the question.\n#### 1\nAnswer: \"E\" or \"Falling Down\"\n\n### Instructions:\nInput: A riddle states that \"A bear who runs away from a frightened man who is running away from a grizzly bear that is running away from a hunter will eventually come to a place where he would no longer find himself in danger from anything.\" If a bear ran all the way from a tree in one forest and arrived at another forest, could the bear be in danger from anything?\nRationales:\"A bear will not come to a place where it is in danger from anything,\" so \"A bear who runs from...\" cannot be the correct answer. \"Bear is not in danger\" contradicts the entire riddle so this cannot be the correct answer either. The next choice after the logical \"or\" is \"comes to a place where she would no longer find herself in danger from anything\" as it states that if a bear ran all the the way from a tree and arrived to another forest, then they can be in danger.\n#### 3\nAnswer: 3\n\n### Instuctions:\nInput:\"A bear who runs away...\" is given.\"...\"The bear did not, but...\"\nRationales: Choice C is the second step taken by the bear, that is, when he came to a place he had never been to before.

{"text": "I would pick Option A because the classroom is quiet for most part. The other places are not interesting, but more interesting in different ways. Classrooms give off a boring vibe or feeling. But all the other places could be more interesting and you could also be playing or doing something, unless maybe you're bored. You can't do that in the classroom.\n\n### Input\nWhat do you prefer? A: the gambling machine B: the arcade game C: the board game D: the scratch-game\n\n### Response\nI would pick Option D because the scratch-game has real money. The other games are all fake.\n\n### Response to the question \"Which game is best for your children?\"\n\nI think that games with real money such as the scratch-game is the best game for my kids. I do not want a game where the person playing with the money does not get anything out of it in the end. These other games may get them excited, but in the end there isn't a real price they are receiving if they win.\n\n### Summary\nGambling games always tend to look more fun and exciting to the people that play them. But when you take a look at what is on the inside, the excitement soon disappears. There isn't anything valuable on the inside. It is the thrill of winning that is the only exciting part. The fun and excitement fades pretty quickly and you are left with the thought that it could have been so much more if you won. In the end, the person that loses realizes the thrill was over so fast since it was fake money they had lost. The people that win just keep the money.\n\nI think that most adults know what they are getting with these other activities. But I hope by educating my children in these areas, they will be better able to realize that these games are no good. I have also explained that even if they win in these games, they are not making money. The only thing they are receiving is nothing. And if the person that had won, had the same amount of money the person that lost had, it would not be the same to them. They would not feel cheated like the one that loses would.\n\nGambling games have a way of making the people playing them feel cheated. They are able to hide it from the kids", "answer": "A: classroom"}

Choices: A: sun himself B : thank god C: race againtst time D: express love  E: to think about what he did \nResponse: The answer is B\nExplanation: \nAccording to the question, it's not for the person to be sleeping hence A is an incorrect answer. \nNot for the person to be sunbathing himself on a chair, option B is not correct since there is a clear option provided to the reader as not for the person to sunbathe himself on the beach, option C is also not correct. \nAs per the text provided, the person cannot be thinking about himself expressing his love or thinking about what could go wrong for instance he could be thinking of what he did to make himself get to the beach thus it is D that is not an option here. \nWhat makes me believe the answer would be B is because the first thing that went through my mind was that he was sunbathing as sunbathing is the first thing that came to mind and therefore I concluded that his reason behind being on the beach was b, which is to sun himself. \n```\n\n### Input The price was $232.95 with a 15% tax,how much did the item actually cost after tax was added to the price?\n\n### Rationales:\nAccording to me $232.85 is the actual price after the tax was added.\n\n### Answer:\nThe answer will 257.605\n\n### Exaplination:\nThe actual price = taxed price - tax.\nTax = $232. 95 * 15%/100\nSo 15%/ 100 = 0.15\nAnd 0.", "answer": "A: sun himself"}

One of them drives to the mall and the other drives back to pick-up the gift. Which of the following statements correctly describes the time it takes for each driver to get to the mall? Choice 1: Tamara takes one hour to get to the mALL, plus one hour to get back. Choice 2: Riana takes one hour to get out, plus one hour to return. Choice 3: Tamara does not return for her friend's gift. Choice 4: Riana only takes one hour to get back to pick-up Tamara. Choice 5: Tamara only takes one hour to pick-up Riana.\n\nTamara lives 6 hours from Riana's and she drives back one hour to pick- Riana up. In total, she drives 5 hours.\nRiana lives 6 hours from where Tamara lives. She drives to the mall, which takes 3 hours. In total, she drive 9 hours.\n\nTamama and Riana take 5 + 9 = <<5+9=14>>14hours in total to get to the malls.\n#### 14\nAnswer: 14\n\n### Choices:\n\nChoice 1: Tamara does not drive home for her friend's birthday gift. Thus, Riana takes 1 hour to drive to the malls, 6 hours to drive back to pick-up her friend's gift plus 6 hours to drive home with the gift, 1 + 6 + 6 = <<1+6+6=13>>13hours.\n\nChoice 2: Riana does not drive home for Tamara's friend's birthday present. Therefore, Tamara drives for 5 + 1 hour = <<5+1=6>>6hours to the malls. As the malls is in the same house as where Tamara does, she does not drive back to pick- up her friend's gift and Riana instead of driving home brings her back so Riana takes 1 + 6 h = <<1+6=7>>7hours to the mall.\n\n#### 13\nAnswer", "answer": "B: motel room"}

Choices: A: 3 B: 4 C: 5 D: 6 E: 7\n\n### Rationale: Answer Choice E is the the minimum number of years because:\nDegrees of 6 years takes 6 years. The least time of a degree of 6 years is one year.\nLet it be: 6. Let us multiply 6 to 6: 36 years. Let it be: 36. We will take a look at the degrees from 6 years to 7 years: 6: 6 years, 6: 5 years, 5: 4 years, 4: 3 years, 3: 2 years, 2: 1 year. The lowest degree of 6 years (minimum degree) is 6 (6 years).

That is the first cow is being cut to half price, and then someone taking the other halves as well as taking the entire cow at regular price.\n\nFor example: the owner wants to get more milk out of the cow. He is paying $10000 for the 200 liters of milk. Another guy is buying a half-and-half cow that produces 100 liters. If we take the 200 and the 100 litres as halves, we have to see it in the other way. We multiply the 100 and then we will see that 100 *2 = 200 litres of milk. So 200 litre milk is equal to one half of the owner of the cow (100 l). If we multiply the 200 (regular price) by two", "answer": "A: exhilaration"}

B --> Construction site\n\nThis is because a metal rod can be a structure of a building.\n\n### Rationale: 2. C --> Shops\n\nThis is because an airplane has engines that require metal rods.\n\nIn the case of a construction site, a metal rod is the same as a steel rod. This is because the \"rod\" is simply a reference to a long, slender pole.\n\nIn addition, the same goes for an engine too. Steel rods are commonly found in engines, where they are used for structural strength and other performance characteristics.\n\nIn short, although \"rod\" might seem to mean something different than the word \"steel\" (which describes an object made of steel), it often doesn't. The context will tell you whether or not a \"wire\" is a \"steel wire\" or a \"wood\" wire.\n\n### Answer: 1 and 3\n\n\n### Instructive Response\n\nChoose the correct response(s).\n\n### Rules: \n\n1. A is not correct because a plane is not a common form of transportation. \n2. C is not correct because a building doesn't often use the term metal rod.\n3. D is not correct because the term broken bone refers to a broken body part.\n4. B is correct because a construction site uses metal rods for structural strength in buildings.\n5. C is correct because an engine uses metal rods.\n6. E is incorrect because a metal rod is not a popular term to describe a metal wire.\n7. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they are incorrect to use in the context.\n8. Explanation: Rods are commonly found in the construction of buildings in shops, engines, broken bones, and airplanes.\n9. Explanation: The first line is incorrect because an airplane doesn't need metal rods to fly.

If we go by context of the sentence from the end, kick the bucket is the best choice, followed by dead. It is not possible for a person to be mortal, dead, can die, or dying. This is because it wouldn't make sense to say \"she is can dying.\" Mortal is closest to being dead because mortal means \"liable to or limited to death.\" It is also possible to say mortal is in reference to being immortal.

They're more likely to be found in a place where machines that have been shut down are kept.  They won't be in an industrial area because no one is using them and you don't often see shut down machines in museums.  Copy machines have probably been replaced by scanners and such.  So a barn would be the most likely place to see old copy machines.  There wouldn't often be an old copy machine in the home of the person who used to own it and they most likely didn't sell it so it's still around.  Since people do need to copy things occasionally, it makes sense that they'd have at least one in a barn.

For the second digit, the farmer counted down by groups of two. He counted from 14 to 25. Then he counted to 16 for the last trip. In each trip, he put one of the odd numbers plus one, for a total of 15 sheep.\n\n### Explain your answer in 50 words or less.\nThe number was an odd number. Because the odd number was 53, the first group of animals was 53, 53.\nNext, he counted down by 2. He counted 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2\nLastly, he counted by the last digit-- 31, 33, 35,", "answer": "A: hurry along"}

{"text": "You are usually looking a blinking lights from a plane at night, although there are some other scenarios that are more unlikely.\n\nIn the above case, A(carnival), and D are two outlier scenarios which are unlikely to occur. However, for the sake of correctness in answering, we shall answer them first:\n\nA) Blinking lights at night are usually from a plane. You must have been watching the TV series, Lost, which was cancelled recently. The scene where a plane flies in a straight direction at night in the air was seen in the TV series. This is not the usual occurrence of seeing blinking lights in the sky but it is not impossible, provided the location in which the scenery is filmed is dark enough.\n\nD) The second most unlikely scenario, but is not so unusual in this day and age, is D. Penguins do blink their bottom lights, and the lights could be seen in the air at night. It is also not an unusual sight in the day time. Apart from penguins, seabirds blink their lights as well, and there are many videos available on the web.\n\nHowever, plane lights are the most likely candidate when it comes to blinking lights in the night sky. There are many videos available on YouTube nowadays, which have captured the blinking lights from aeroplanes in the night sky.\n\nThere are also other types of lights that blink in the night sky:\n\n1) Helicopters\n\n2) Fireworks\n\nAs far as helicopters are concerned, they blink their lights at a constant rate which cannot be mistaken with aeroplanes.\n\nYou would also be able to discern between a helicopter and an aeroplane by sound, because helicopters sound distinctly different from aeroplanes. The difference in sound is because a single propeller of course a helicopter produces the sound, whereas in aeroplanes there are multiple propellers, the sound will be louder at the tail.\n\nFireworks, unfortunately is another of the more unlikely scenario. However, we cannot disregard it. Fireworks blink lights quite rapidly in a sequence which will be slightly different than an aeroplane, so if you see lights blinking and then gradually stop, then it is definitely fireworks.\n\nE) is an incorrect scenario as", "answer": "B: plane"}

{"text": "I wish I could answer A, that could have helped my school district to understand their students when they complained about being bullied.\n\nHowever, I couldn't answer either B or C. Instead, I would ask for an informal meeting to learn more about their complaints. This may seem odd to most people's eyes so I would explain that my school district had a policy that the complainant should be a part of deciding the outcome of the policy. We want everyone's feedback including the bully, the victim, the witnesses, and the school district.\n\nI would be willing to listen to both points of view and then I would ask the bullies' side point out where their view of how they should react has harmed more people than it has helped. I might bring some of the hurt feelings/confused feelings/damaged property to point out that it had taken someone (the complainant) to see the bully from the other side's shoes. This would help us try to understand each other better and hopefully give us ideas to avoid this from happening in the future for either the bully or the victim.\n\nI would hope that people might feel better about coming forward even if they had not been victims. One way we could use the sandwich strategy is for the one person to say I had a really hard time trying to understand the other person, but you helped me look at things from a different prospective.

You can use this strategy to make change. How many smaller bags of cereal would you need to pay $7 for a large box of cereal, if the per-quantity price of the large box is 4 times the per-quantity price small box of cereal?\nAnswers:\n1) 6 (the cost of 10 bags would be $1.90. 7 \u00d7 10 = 70.

{"text": "(Choose the best answer and fill in the blank with an accurate choice):\n\n#### Answer: C\nAnswer: C\n\n### Instructions:Complete the number cube using the instructions provided.\n\n#### Instructions:\nThe number cube shown in the example above is a 3x3 cube. The dotted lines indicate the center of the cube and the small white circles represent the spaces on the outside corners. The center is the center of the cube, meaning it lies on either of the edges of the cube or where the two diagonals meet in the middle. The faces of the cube are the numbered spaces on the outside corners of the cube.\nA solid line indicates that a face of the cube has the value. Dashed lines indicate a face of the cube does not have the value.\nIn order to complete the number cube you need to fill in the blanks for the nine faces of the cube. Some faces have multiple choices.\nInput: You are on a mission to complete every face of the cube. To do so, you will multiply each number by that face's number. You can multiply by faces directly next to each other in any order.\nRationales: To complete the cube, we will need to determine which number each face refers to. The faces, like the numbers, must add up to 10 because that is the total number of squares. To find these numbers we look at the order in which both the numbers are listed and in which the faces are listed.\nStarting from any face, we can start by multiplying by the first number, which the face directly next to us is saying to do. The next face, the second square away, we will multiply by multiplying by four times the previous face.\nContinuing this pattern, the third face away we will multiply by four times the face we are currently facing. To summarize, you can multiply by the value of the face which is a square away from you.\nIf you multiply the dotted horizontal line by the face it refers to, it gives you the value of the face.\nLet's start at the bottom left corner and multiply the middle dotted line by 1. This gives us 1,1,1 because each line multiplied by the value of the square gave us a 1. Let's continue moving around the cube until we fill in all the blanks.\nThe second dotted line is on the right.", "answer": "D: have lunch"}

{"text": "A: apartment\n\n### Justification: The word 'place' has a multiple meaning in this context. It means the area or location of the items or the place where you usually store those items. I have also seen the word 'place' used as noun, in the sense of a particular area, location. I am averse to including place A, since the context clearly demands that the items be stored together. The word 'pantry' means the area where you store groceries. For example, a pantry is a kitchen cabinet. It does not also refer to the grocery store. The word'shelf' refers to the place where items are usually stored one on top of the other. A bookshelf is the place where you usually put books. Since the context demands that these items be stored together, place B and place C do not make sense. Since the context clearly demands the items to be stored together, place D, the living or family room, does not make sense. But option E is in tune with the context.\n\n####  A\nAnswer: apartment\n\n\n### Input:'The sum of 35 and 7 is greater than 7 and the sum of 15'\n\n### Response:'The sum of 7 and 35 is greater'\n\n### Justifications: In the context, option A means \"Add 35 and 42, and the answer will always be greater than 7 and 7,\". Since the context clearly demans the answer to be greater than 7, A does not make sense. Answer B is correct because option B means \"Add 15 and 35, and the answer will *always* be greater than 7.\" option C says \"Add 7 and 34, and the answer will be *always* greater than 7\". C is incorrect simply because 35 + 7 would not always result in \"greater\" than 7. option D says 'The sum of 7& 34 is greater than or equal to' is incorrect because 7 + 34 is not greater than or equal to anything. option E says 'The sum of the greatest number greater than 7 is greater than' is correct because a greater number always results in a greater sum, and the sum of 35 plus 7 is a greater number than the sum of 7 plus 3", "answer": "B: pantry"}

To walk to the bus depot from the train depot, a person's speed is double that of when walking the same distance to the train depot. How much more time would this person spend walking from the train depot to the bus depot?\nRationales:: Let x = the number of kilometers between the train depot and the bus depot.\nSince the bus depot is located 4 x the train depot, we could then say, x = 8x\nx + 2k = the distance the walker walks to walk to the bus dep0t from the train depot\nTo find x, we solve for x when x + 2k = 8x\nSimplifying we get 2k = 7x\nSubtracting from both sides, we can say, k = <<7x>>7x/2\nNow we want to look at k, and the distance the walker would have to walk between the train depot to bus depot when the walking speed is x/2\n7x / 2 = the number of kilomters the walker walked to go from the train to the bus depot\nSo, 7x / 2 is also x\n14d = x - x/2\nIf we subtract 2x from each side, we get, 14x - 7x/2 = 0\nIf we multiply both sides by -14, we can write the equation as 14x + 7x/2(14) = 0\nRationalizing, we can see that -14x + 14x -14x = 0\nThere is no solution for x since the equation is the equation above\nWe can conclude that the person would spend the same amount of time walking to the bus depot as walking between the train and the bus depot\nThis is because both walks are equal to 0\n#### 0\nAnswer: 0\n\n### Input\nInput: A 30 pound bag of candy cost 6 cents more than a 20 pound bag of the same candy.

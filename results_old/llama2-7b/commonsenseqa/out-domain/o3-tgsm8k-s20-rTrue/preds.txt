Choices:  A: sleeping longer B: getting cold C: death and decay D: change of color E: stop breathing<n><n>### Response:		Choice C: death and decay.<n><n>### Input Choice A: sleeping longer:<n>Sleep is a restful, necessary, and natural process. It relieves stress and allows our bodies and minds to re-energize and repair. The brain’s electrical activity switches into a slow-wave sleep mode as muscles relax and heart rate and blood pressure drop. The natural progression of sleep takes us through all these stages as the night progresses. It’s typical to sleep more at the end of the first part of the night. The average length of sleep for healthy young adults is about 7 hours.<n><n>### Response Choice A: sleep<n><n>### Input A: getting colder:<n>When we sleep, our bodies produce less of the body hormone prolactin. Prolactin keeps us feeling warm by keeping our sweat glands active. If we lose enough prolactin, we lose our ability to sweat. We also lose the ability to keep our muscles warm. After all, we cannot easily move while we are sleeping. Together these two factors make us feel colder while we sleep. When we get to the REM cycles, our muscles twitch and jerk and may result in cramping. The twitching also may be associated with coldness.<n><n>### B: Dying and Decay:<n>Your body’s cells are constantly dying and regenerating, a process called “cell replacement.” Most cells die off and are replaced every month or two—only some such as brain cells die much more slowly and don’t regenerate as quickly.<n><n>### C: Change of Color:<n>As you get older, some cells stop producing sufficient amounts of melanin to protect your skin. A sunscreen helps, but aging skin eventually becomes more vulnerable.<n><n>### E: Stop breathing:<n>We spend, on average, one-third of our life asleep – and a third of that time is lost breathing. Breathing patterns differ between REM and non-REM cycles. While we are in REM sleep, we almost completely stop breathing while a deep stage of non-REM sleep takes over. It is estimated that we take about ten breaths a minute in REM sleep, the deepest stage we experience, in comparison with the 12 to 20 breath

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Rationales: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: 5<n><n>### Input:What type of home is most likely to have an attic filled with historical items? Choices:  A: top of home B: older houses C: victorian house D: own home E: material<n><n>### Response:		Choice A: top of home<n><n>### Rationale:<n>If this is a historical site, the people there are probably interested in history and may have collected historical items.<n>Therefore, the home with the most historical items would be the top (in order to stay out of the way) and also the older (in order to have a long-time site with historical things happening).<n><n><n>### Response 2: Choice B: older houses<n><n>### Rationales:<n>In the past, items were more durable and lasted for a longer time. Therefore, older houses would have older items lasting longer.<n><n><n>### R3: Choice A: victorian house<n><n>### Ratios:<n>Older Victorian houses would also most likely have a lot of history, but, they seem like a niche place. This is because Victorian houses were a popular architectural style in the 1800's and 1900's, it would be unlikely for old victorian homes to be around now. (Unless it is a historical site. It's probably still being used as a location that people can view.) Therefore, it would still be a historical place, but is unlikely to be a location that still contains historical items.<n><n>### R4: Choice E: material<n><n>I think that this refers to the location where these things are being shown. So it would be the most likely in either an art museum or gallery.<n><n>### 👋 Goodbye

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve.

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Rationales: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: 5<n><n>### Input:The small cabin was not available, so they were upgraded to what?

The total number of days that the school bus did not run the last 5 years was 420. The new total number days that the bus did not run the current school year is 315. What is the year that it snowed the coldest in the last 7 years?(The first time that it snowed was last school year, when the total number of days the bus did not run was 360)<n><n>### Answer 2:<n>The correct answer, given the following:<n><n>The school bus did not run for 5 consecutive days last December, as there was 12 feet of snow. It was colder the previous December (when there was 3 inches of snow), as the total number of days that they did not run was 5 (last year the temperature was 5 degrees warmer than this year). The first time that snow was encountered was in 2014, when the school bus did not work for 6 days.<n><n>The question was:<n>7 years ago (12 years - 5 years) = 7 years<n><n>Last year that it snowed and how many days the bus did not work was 12, so last year, the year that it snow the most was not the last 7 years ago.<n><n>The school bus was stopped for 29 days last December, meaning last Dec's the coldest in

Choices:  A: speak freely B: happiness of a child C: care for children D: school child E: control children<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I think the parent’s primary duty is to control the children. This because parents are said to have responsibility of their children and children are expected to behave as stated by parents. Therefore all these will be possible when the children are well controlled and this can not be possible if the parent is not responsible and do all that is necessary for the children. (E) This is why parents should control their children since they can dictate how they should behave as well as control how they use their time. (A) The parents primary duty is to control children because children will behave according to what they are taught as well as the instructions given to them. The children will always want to be at peace with their parents hence they will listen to their parents and learn from them. (C) Parents are supposed to take care of their children since they are the ones expected to feed the children and in addition take them to school as well as control them. Even when in school, parents are expected to control the children and do everything to ensure that their children have good behaviour both in school and at home as well as control how time is spent. (D) A parents primary duty is to school their children. This is because schooling children has become easier and this is why schools are so many. Even if the parents decide not to take the responsibility of schooling their children, they will leave them to someone who will take responsibility of them. In this case their primary duty is to school the children. (B) I think that the parents primary duty is to take care of their child. This because children are vulnerable and this is why they need to be taken care of and be attended to. This is because they do not know how to take care of themselves.

Her deli is a niche that is uncommon in a non-Jewish populated area. In order to attract consumers, she needs to also attract their friends. It would be too difficult to gain their trust or even find anyone that would try it in the first place.<n><n>#### Choices:<n>A: This person will try a new type of restaurant but will not eat there again because the deli is not what the person is looking for.  Even if the food itself was appealing to them, they aren't satisfied with the location.<n>B: This person is also not satisfied because they feel the location is not appealing. They have already eaten there and are looking for something else. They will try another Jewish deli in a different are because their friends would probably recommend it.<n>C: This customer is not satisfied with the food at the deli, but will try another.  Their friends have probably tried the same one and recommend it. It could be recommended by people from other towns that are not too far away and have heard of the deli. It has a small chance of becoming busy if the word reaches enough people.<n>D: This customer will not try the food at the deli because it is not what they are used to eating.  Food is a part of culture and not all cultures will be compatible with another. In addition, it is more expensive to pay for the transportation it will take to get there from other towns.  It's also more expensive for Lilly to reach out to customers in other towns because it requires them to market in every place that they should try their new place.  If they were only targeting New York City, they wouldn't have to pay someone to go to other places to market.

Choices:  A: construction site B: cemetary C: building D: city E: archeological site<n><n>### Response:		<n>C<n>An excavation is any activity that involves digging a hole. An archaeological site is an underground location that holds evidence of past human activity. An archaeological is different from building construction and cemetery burial because it focuses on digging up and studying artifacts of human civilizations of the past. Burial grounds are a location where corpses are stored underground, usually after a funeral. Excavations that occur near buildings can damage infrastructure if they are not performed carefully, making buildings dangerous for people to occupy and potentially resulting in severe property damage, injuries, and death. Archaeological excavations, on the other hand, cannot harm buildings. C is the correct choice based on these reasons.<n>####<n>Answer: C<n>### Input: How are the numbers 25 and 108 related?

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes.

However, her budget may be the same. Let x be the total number of dollars Jenny spent for groceries.<n>Jenny ate y more units of noodles than Shane.<n>Jenny spent $z per unit of noodles.<n>Now, we have these two equations:<n>y * z = all the noodles Jenny ate.<n>y * $z = all the noodle money Jenny spent.<n>Subtracting y * $z from both sides, we can see that<n>$z - y * $z = $y, the total amount of noodles Jenny spent<n>Divide both sides by $z and we can see that y / $z = $y.<n>Letting r be the ratio of the noodles Jenry purchased, we get<n>$y = $z * r, which means Jenny's ratio purchase of noodles = $z / $y<n>Now, we know Jenny also ate y more units than Shane, and Jenny spend $r more dollars for each unit than Shane did.<n>So, Jenny's ratio of dollars to noodles = $r * $y / r = $y.<n>Jenny bought y more noodles for the same amount of dollars. Thus, there is no "more" money spent on noodles for Jenny, but there is "more" no

Choices:  A: pleasure B: accident C: get somewhere D: hurt E: falling down<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is "E" or "falling down." A bike ride may be hard, but also may be enjoyable (pleasure), or a bike may have an accident (accident) or it can help one reach a destination (get somewhere) or one can be hurt (hurt). Yet none of those options can be the answer to the riddle. This response can be found with the statement that a bike can hurt one. The question is specifically asking which answer fits with "riding bike through rough terrain" implying getting hurt. Only the answer "falling down" matches both the wording of the riddle and the logic of the question.<n>#### 1<n>Answer: "E" or "Falling Down"<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Input: A riddle states that "A bear who runs away from a frightened man who is running away from a grizzly bear that is running away from a hunter will eventually come to a place where he would no longer find himself in danger from anything." If a bear ran all the way from a tree in one forest and arrived at another forest, could the bear be in danger from anything?<n>Rationales:"A bear will not come to a place where it is in danger from anything," so "A bear who runs from..." cannot be the correct answer. "Bear is not in danger" contradicts the entire riddle so this cannot be the correct answer either. The next choice after the logical "or" is "comes to a place where she would no longer find herself in danger from anything" as it states that if a bear ran all the the way from a tree and arrived to another forest, then they can be in danger.<n>#### 3<n>Answer: 3<n><n>### Instuctions:<n>Input:"A bear who runs away..." is given."..."The bear did not, but..."<n>Rationales: Choice C is the second step taken by the bear, that is, when he came to a place he had never been to before. Choices "I will not eat it unless I am starving," and "What if they eat their own poop?" which are choices D and E are both part of a different riddle. The other riddle is:<n><n>> Question: There are four men living in separate rooms. In every room is a can of beans with a lid so that the can cannot be opened from

Choices:  A: classroom B: toy store C: school D: soccer game E: dinner<n><n>### Response:		<n>I would pick Option A because the classroom is quiet for most part. The other places are not interesting, but more interesting in different ways. Classrooms give off a boring vibe or feeling. But all the other places could be more interesting and you could also be playing or doing something, unless maybe you're bored. You can't do that in the classroom.<n><n>### Input<n>What do you prefer? A: the gambling machine B: the arcade game C: the board game D: the scratch-game<n><n>### Response<n>I would pick Option D because the scratch-game has real money. The other games are all fake.<n><n>### Response to the question "Which game is best for your children?"<n><n>I think that games with real money such as the scratch-game is the best game for my kids. I do not want a game where the person playing with the money does not get anything out of it in the end. These other games may get them excited, but in the end there isn't a real price they are receiving if they win.<n><n>### Summary<n>Gambling games always tend to look more fun and exciting to the people that play them. But when you take a look at what is on the inside, the excitement soon disappears. There isn't anything valuable on the inside. It is the thrill of winning that is the only exciting part. The fun and excitement fades pretty quickly and you are left with the thought that it could have been so much more if you won. In the end, the person that loses realizes the thrill was over so fast since it was fake money they had lost. The people that win just keep the money.<n><n>I think that most adults know what they are getting with these other activities. But I hope by educating my children in these areas, they will be better able to realize that these games are no good. I have also explained that even if they win in these games, they are not making money. The only thing they are receiving is nothing. And if the person that had won, had the same amount of money the person that lost had, it would not be the same to them. They would not feel cheated like the one that loses would.<n><n>Gambling games have a way of making the people playing them feel cheated. They are able to hide it from the kids

One of them drives to the mall and the other drives back to pick-up the gift. Which of the following statements correctly describes the time it takes for each driver to get to the mall? Choice 1: Tamara takes one hour to get to the mALL, plus one hour to get back. Choice 2: Riana takes one hour to get out, plus one hour to return. Choice 3: Tamara does not return for her friend's gift. Choice 4: Riana only takes one hour to get back to pick-up Tamara. Choice 5: Tamara only takes one hour to pick-up Riana.<n><n>Tamara lives 6 hours from Riana's and she drives back one hour to pick- Riana up. In total, she drives 5 hours.<n>Riana lives 6 hours from where Tamara lives. She drives to the mall, which takes 3 hours. In total, she drive 9 hours.<n><n>Tamama and Riana take 5 + 9 = <<5+9=14>>14hours in total to get to the malls.<n>#### 14<n>Answer: 14<n><n>### Choices:<n><n>Choice 1: Tamara does not drive home for her friend's birthday gift. Thus, Riana takes 1 hour to drive to the malls, 6 hours to drive back to pick-up her friend's gift plus 6 hours to drive home with the gift, 1 + 6 + 6 = <<1+6+6=13>>13hours.<n><n>Choice 2: Riana does not drive home for Tamara's friend's birthday present. Therefore, Tamara drives for 5 + 1 hour = <<5+1=6>>6hours to the malls. As the malls is in the same house as where Tamara does, she does not drive back to pick- up her friend's gift and Riana instead of driving home brings her back so Riana takes 1 + 6 h = <<1+6=7>>7hours to the mall.<n><n>#### 13<n>Answer

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes.

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

You can see that by looking at these two numbers. The second one here, 7, I'm going to take 7 as a prime. Let's factor out 7 so it's easier to see. I have 1 times 7 on the outside. We're going to multiply this. 1 times 7 doesn't look a whole lot better. Then I'm going to factor in 1. This is multiplying 1 and 7. This is multiplying a whole bunch of 1's by 7. That's the same as multiplying one by itself 7 times. That's what we're doing here.<n><n>#### Choice5<n><n>### Answer to Input Part 1:<n>The question reads:<n><n>If you're on a bike and Corey is in a car driving along a certain route, what are the following situations?<n><n>I'm going to assume that Corey was driving and Tapanga was riding her bike on the same route.

It is therefore found in orchestras and symphonies (where one or more string instruments are played, usually including the violin). But as it is less commonly played than the violin, a viola would be more common in a string quartet (made up of violin, viola, cello and double bass). This is to my knowledge (as I’ve been playing violin for many years).<n><n>

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

The least time of a degree of 6 years is one year.<n>Let it be: 6. Let us multiply 6 to 6: 36 years. Let it be: 36. We will take a look at the degrees from 6 years to 7 years: 6: 6 years, 6: 5 years, 5: 4 years, 4: 3 years, 3: 2 years, 2: 1 year. The lowest degree of 6 years (minimum degree) is 6 (6 years).

That is the first cow is being cut to half price, and then someone taking the other halves as well as taking the entire cow at regular price.<n><n>For example: the owner wants to get more milk out of the cow. He is paying $10000 for the 200 liters of milk. Another guy is buying a half-and-half cow that produces 100 liters. If we take the 200 and the 100 litres as halves, we have to see it in the other way. We multiply the 100 and then we will see that 100 *2 = 200 litres of milk. So 200 litre milk is equal to one half of the owner of the cow (100 l). If we multiply the 200 (regular price) by two

Do your best to find three other pairs of consecutive numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) in the table where 14 is also found?"<n><n>### Response:"My best is finding 2 adjacent numbers from the first column and from the second column that also add up to 14."<n><n>### Demotstration:<n><n>1-First, we are working with a table of odd numbers so the first two columns can't have any consecutive even numbers. It is in the second column where we find the consecutive odd numbers from the first column.<n><n>2- The sentence "Do your best to find three pairs of consecutive numbers" is telling you to find the pairs, one thing at a time. I found 2 pairs, therefore, I am doing my best if I got 3. But I only need 2 to find 14.<n><n>3- The sentence "In the table where 12 is also found" is telling you to "in the table where...." so if there are two 14 in the table, I found both where they were and the pairs I needed in order to get there.<n><n>####2<n>Answer:"My best is finding another pair of consecutive numbers [1, 2] in the table where 4 is also found."<n><n>### Input:(Answered wrong)<n><n>### Demosstration:<n><n>### Answer:50 + 5 + 40.4 = 94.4<n><n>###

C --> Shops<n><n>This is because an airplane has engines that require metal rods.<n><n>In the case of a construction site, a metal rod is the same as a steel rod. This is because the "rod" is simply a reference to a long, slender pole.<n><n>In addition, the same goes for an engine too. Steel rods are commonly found in engines, where they are used for structural strength and other performance characteristics.<n><n>In short, although "rod" might seem to mean something different than the word "steel" (which describes an object made of steel), it often doesn't.

You're the first woman that I've ever seen that has a brain AND TITS!" You know that he is talking about the female beaver and not a stripper because the female beaver builds dams.<n>The beaver builds its dam at the side of the river where the current creates a swirling vortex. The dam then disrupts the flow of the river so that the force of gravity cannot pull water from the lake to the ocean. This is why it's so important to keep the beaver population under control.

Choices:  A: kick the bucket B: mortal C: dead D: can die E: dying<n><n>### Response:		The word that is missing are mortal, dead and kick the bucket.<n><n>### Rationales:If we are missing a word it should be one of the closest to the end of the sentence according to the meaning of the sentence. Kick the bucket is closest to the end of sentence, followed by dead, followed by mortal, followed by can die, and followed be dying. If we go by context of the sentence from the end, kick the bucket is the best choice, followed by dead. It is not possible for a person to be mortal, dead, can die, or dying. This is because it wouldn't make sense to say "she is can dying." Mortal is closest to being dead because mortal means "liable to or limited to death." It is also possible to say mortal is in reference to being immortal.

Choices:  A: industrial area B: museum C: barn D: school E: office<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Input A is the answer<n><n>### Rationale:<n>These are old copy machines, they're not being used anymore.  They're probably not being used in a museum, a school or an office.  They're more likely to be found in a place where machines that have been shut down are kept.  They won't be in an industrial area because no one is using them and you don't often see shut down machines in museums.  Copy machines have probably been replaced by scanners and such.  So a barn would be the most likely place to see old copy machines.  There wouldn't often be an old copy machine in the home of the person who used to own it and they most likely didn't sell it so it's still around.  Since people do need to copy things occasionally, it makes sense that they'd have at least one in a barn.  This is probably the last place that they would be and the one most likely to still have one.<n><n>#### 2

Choices:  A: carnival B: plane C: concert D: turned at night E: a penguin's bum<n><n>### Response:		<n>You are usually looking a blinking lights from a plane at night, although there are some other scenarios that are more unlikely.<n><n>In the above case, A(carnival), and D are two outlier scenarios which are unlikely to occur. However, for the sake of correctness in answering, we shall answer them first:<n><n>A) Blinking lights at night are usually from a plane. You must have been watching the TV series, Lost, which was cancelled recently. The scene where a plane flies in a straight direction at night in the air was seen in the TV series. This is not the usual occurrence of seeing blinking lights in the sky but it is not impossible, provided the location in which the scenery is filmed is dark enough.<n><n>D) The second most unlikely scenario, but is not so unusual in this day and age, is D. Penguins do blink their bottom lights, and the lights could be seen in the air at night. It is also not an unusual sight in the day time. Apart from penguins, seabirds blink their lights as well, and there are many videos available on the web.<n><n>However, plane lights are the most likely candidate when it comes to blinking lights in the night sky. There are many videos available on YouTube nowadays, which have captured the blinking lights from aeroplanes in the night sky.<n><n>There are also other types of lights that blink in the night sky:<n><n>1) Helicopters<n><n>2) Fireworks<n><n>As far as helicopters are concerned, they blink their lights at a constant rate which cannot be mistaken with aeroplanes.<n><n>You would also be able to discern between a helicopter and an aeroplane by sound, because helicopters sound distinctly different from aeroplanes. The difference in sound is because a single propeller of course a helicopter produces the sound, whereas in aeroplanes there are multiple propellers, the sound will be louder at the tail.<n><n>Fireworks, unfortunately is another of the more unlikely scenario. However, we cannot disregard it. Fireworks blink lights quite rapidly in a sequence which will be slightly different than an aeroplane, so if you see lights blinking and then gradually stop, then it is definitely fireworks.<n><n>E) is an incorrect scenario as

Instead, I would ask for an informal meeting to learn more about their complaints. This may seem odd to most people's eyes so I would explain that my school district had a policy that the complainant should be a part of deciding the outcome of the policy. We want everyone's feedback including the bully, the victim, the witnesses, and the school district.<n><n>I would be willing to listen to both points of view and then I would ask the bullies' side point out where their view of how they should react has harmed more people than it has helped. I might bring some of the hurt feelings/confused feelings/damaged property to point out that it had taken someone (the complainant) to see the bully from the other side's shoes. This would help us try to understand each other better and hopefully give us ideas to avoid this from happening in the future for either the bully or the victim.<n><n>I would hope that people might feel better about coming forward even if they had not been victims. One way we could use the sandwich strategy is for the one person to say I had a really hard time trying to understand the other person, but you helped me look at things from a different prospective. They could be sandwiched in the middle of the positive statement by saying I got to know you today, and you really helped show me why you acted like you did. We could all take a step closer to understanding each other and having our needs met.<n><n>### Output: <n><n>#### B<n><n>#### C<n><n>#### D<n><n>#### E<n><n>#### F<n><n>#### G<n>

That would mean the line would be long (meaning busy) and thus people would arrive late. To get from one place to another, you have to go through lines. When you wait in lines you have to wait a long time.<n>But when you have your own table, you can go wherever you want whenever you want, without waiting in line. If there is still a line (busy), you can go to another restaurant.<n><n>#### 1<n>Answer:<n>It is better to get out of the house than to stay there all [of the time].<n><n>### Input and Rationales: <n>```<n>I need to go to my sister’s house.<n><n>The store is too far from my house.<n>My sister lives in the same complex as I do.<n>I will have to walk to the next block, then take the bus to my sister’s complex.<n>I need to get to my sister’s.<n>```<n><n>#### 100<n>Answer:<n>I will not have to wait in line.<n><n>### Rationale: <n>We can't use this code.

How would somebody with each disability eat the candies: A - Blindly, B - By tasting, C- by examing, D - with the help of a sighted friend?<n>Rationales A - A person with visual impairment would normally eat candy blindly. So person A is blind.<n>B - Sighted person B eats candy by taste. Tasting is an example of a tactile sense, to identify the type of candy one would use a tactile sense. So person B is sighted.<n><n>C - Person with partial or full sight has no sense of vision. In the absence of vision, sighted person would identify the candy with the help of a person with hearing ability. So person C would be a sighted person with full or partial sight.<n>D - Person who is colorblind cannot identify colorful things and would require help to identify the color of candy. So person D is colorblind.<n><n>### Output<n>Output: A) person A is blind and blind person eat candy with the help or the sighted person.

In a grocery store, the per-item price is called a unit price. For example, if the per-item price of a small bag is $1.95 and the per-item price a medium bag is $3.00, the cost of 10 small bags is $1.90, and the cost of 20 medium bags is $5.80. You can use this strategy to make change. How many smaller bags of cereal would you need to pay $7 for a large box of cereal, if the per-quantity price of the large box is 4 times the per-quantity price small box of cereal?<n>Answers:<n>1) 6 (the cost of 10 bags would be $1.90. 7 × 10 = 70. The per-quantity price of this cereal is 4, so the cost of 30 bags of cereals would be 4 × 30 = 120. Then divide 120 by 4 to get 30, which is the answer.)

However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?<n>Rationales: Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.<n>x + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.<n>The equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66<n>Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66<n>Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58<n>Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.<n>#### 29<n>Answer: 29<n><n>Input: Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve. He calls his dad, who lives in the same city as him, and they talk for 45 minutes. Then he calls his brother, who lives on the other side of the world, and they talk for 31 minutes. Local calls cost 5 cents a minute, while international calls cost 25 cents a minute. How many dollars did Freddy spend calling his family on New Year's Eve?<n>Rationales: At 5 cents a minute, calling his father cost Freddy 5* 45 = <<5*45=225>>225 cents.<n>At 25 cents a minute, calling his brother cost Freddy 25 * 31 = <<25*31=775>>775 cents.<n>Adding the cost of calling his father and brother, we find that Freddy paid a total of 225 + 775 = <<225+775=1000>>1000 cents.<n>Since each dollar has 100 cents, Freddy paid 1000 / 100 = <<1000/100=10>>10 dollars<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: Lawrence worked 8 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. He worked 5.5 hours on both Wednesday and Thursday. How many hours would Lawrence work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day?<n>Rationales: 8 hours * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours<n>5.5 * 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 hours<n>24 + 11 = <<24+11=35>>35 hours<n>35/7 = <<35/7=5>>5 hours<n>Lawrence would work 5 hours each of the 7 days in a week.<n>#### 5<n>Answer: 5<n><n>### Input:Johnny sat on a bench and relaxed after doing a lot of work on his hobby.  Where is he? Choices:  A: state park B: bus depot C: garden D: gym E: rest area<n><n>### Response:		The choices are:B: bus depot<n><n>### Input and instructions from a previous user:<n>Johnny sat on a park bench and decided to do some work on his hobies. Which of these is the park bench?<n><n>### This User's Rationales<n>Choices B<n>Choices D<n>Choices E<n><n>### Choice B:<n>The garden.<n>Let x = the distance from the park bench.<n>Let y = the distance from the bus depot.<n>Using the distance formula, x + y = distance of park bench and bus station.<n>Combining like  terms, we get 6 + y = distance of garden and bus station.<n>Subtracting y from both sides, we have 6 = distance of garden and rest area.<n>Rewriting this by getting rid of like terms, we find that the total distance of the park bench from the garden and the bus station is 6.<n><n>### Choices D<n>Since x + y = distance park bench from bus depot and rest area,<n>6 = distance of garden from bus station, and 6 = distance of park bencht from bus station and rest area.<n>Subtract 6 from both sides, we find that 0 = distance of park benche and rest area.<n>From this we can conclude that the distance between park bench and rest area is 0. <n>Therefore, park bench is 0 meters from the rest area, meaning that park bench and rest arena are in the same spot.<n><n>### Input Choice E:<n>The rest area would have to be at the same place as the garden and bus station (as we've concluded from options D) the rest area must be the same place as the bus station and garden. If the garden is the same place as the rest area, then the bus station is the same place as garden. This means that the park bench is the same place as bus station and rest area, and bus station and rest area are the same place, since we know park benches and rest area are the sam place, then the garden is the same as bus station, thereby making the bus stations equal to park benches.<n><n>From this, we can conclude that the park bench and bus stations are the same place, and the park bench, garden, and bus stops are all in the same

The dotted lines indicate the center of the cube and the small white circles represent the spaces on the outside corners. The center is the center of the cube, meaning it lies on either of the edges of the cube or where the two diagonals meet in the middle. The faces of the cube are the numbered spaces on the outside corners of the cube.<n>A solid line indicates that a face of the cube has the value. Dashed lines indicate a face of the cube does not have the value.<n>In order to complete the number cube you need to fill in the blanks for the nine faces of the cube. Some faces have multiple choices.<n>Input: You are on a mission to complete every face of the cube. To do so, you will multiply each number by that face's number. You can multiply by faces directly next to each other in any order.<n>Rationales: To complete the cube, we will need to determine which number each face refers to. The faces, like the numbers, must add up to 10 because that is the total number of squares. To find these numbers we look at the order in which both the numbers are listed and in which the faces are listed.<n>Starting from any face, we can start by multiplying by the first number, which the face directly next to us is saying to do. The next face, the second square away, we will multiply by multiplying by four times the previous face.<n>Continuing this pattern, the third face away we will multiply by four times the face we are currently facing. To summarize, you can multiply by the value of the face which is a square away from you.<n>If you multiply the dotted horizontal line by the face it refers to, it gives you the value of the face.<n>Let's start at the bottom left corner and multiply the middle dotted line by 1. This gives us 1,1,1 because each line multiplied by the value of the square gave us a 1. Let's continue moving around the cube until we fill in all the blanks.<n>The second dotted line is on the right.

Choices:  A: music store B: orchestra C: jazz band D: rock band E: music studio<n><n>### Response:		A music studio is a place where music is either listened to, watched or recorded. A concerto could be performed for clarinet (or any other instrument for that matter) so a concerto is more likely to be performed with music studio members or music performers rather than with members of bands. A concerto requires a soloist and an accompaniment, which typically consists of 1 to 10 string ensemble instruments; wind (wood wave) instruments; brass instruments; percussion instruments; keyboards; and choirs of vocalists. It is usually intended to highlight the soloist, who plays the main melodies and improvisations, although the entire band can improvise too. Bands do not typically perform in a concert setting where an audience is listening and not playing music themselves.<n><n>### **Instruction:Answer the following question**<n><n>### **Input:What is the difference between the mean and mode of a data set of at least 500 entries?

Choices:  A: apartment B: pantry C: table D: living room E: shelf<n><n>### Response:		A: apartment<n><n>### Justification: The word 'place' has a multiple meaning in this context. It means the area or location of the items or the place where you usually store those items. I have also seen the word 'place' used as noun, in the sense of a particular area, location. I am averse to including place A, since the context clearly demands that the items be stored together. The word 'pantry' means the area where you store groceries. For example, a pantry is a kitchen cabinet. It does not also refer to the grocery store. The word'shelf' refers to the place where items are usually stored one on top of the other. A bookshelf is the place where you usually put books. Since the context demands that these items be stored together, place B and place C do not make sense. Since the context clearly demands the items to be stored together, place D, the living or family room, does not make sense. But option E is in tune with the context.<n><n>####  A<n>Answer: apartment<n><n><n>### Input:'The sum of 35 and 7 is greater than 7 and the sum of 15'<n><n>### Response:'The sum of 7 and 35 is greater'<n><n>### Justifications: In the context, option A means "Add 35 and 42, and the answer will always be greater than 7 and 7,". Since the context clearly demans the answer to be greater than 7, A does not make sense. Answer B is correct because option B means "Add 15 and 35, and the answer will *always* be greater than 7." option C says "Add 7 and 34, and the answer will be *always* greater than 7". C is incorrect simply because 35 + 7 would not always result in "greater" than 7. option D says 'The sum of 7& 34 is greater than or equal to' is incorrect because 7 + 34 is not greater than or equal to anything. option E says 'The sum of the greatest number greater than 7 is greater than' is correct because a greater number always results in a greater sum, and the sum of 35 plus 7 is a greater number than the sum of 7 plus 3

Choices:  A: maps B: street C: catch bus D: city centre E: school<n><n>### Response:		The bus station needs to be close to the city centre. It would be much less convenient if it was close to school, as that would require taking multiple buses to get to the station. The map at the station would also be hard to use with the city buses, and taking one would take much longer than just catching the next bus. The street is very crowded with people passing by, and it would be much too difficult to get in and out of the bus station. Finally, since the bus station cannot be on the street, it is more convenient if the bus station is near the city centre. There, riders can then catch a bus in a bus station to get them to their destination.<n>#### The response is detailed and accurately summarizes the information.<n>#### The response effectively shows the rationale for each choice.<n>#### The response explains why each place is a poor choice.<n>B.<n>#### The response accurately describes how each place is difficult to use due to its proximity.<n>#### The response shows how each place is inconvenient (e.g., due to the crowded streets) and inefficient (e.g., taking many different buses).<n>

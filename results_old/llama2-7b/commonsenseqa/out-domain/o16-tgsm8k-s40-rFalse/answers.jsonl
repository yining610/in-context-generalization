{"text": "The correct answer is \"C\"\n\nIt really depends on the type of book, but most adult fiction and non-fiction fall in the 60,000...words range. Children's books tend to be much shorter, though, depending on the age range. I've been told that a well-written children's book should be no more than a few thousand words though; some are a few hundred words or less, depending on what the book teaches.\n\nIn conclusion, most books published by major publishers (Simon and Schuster, etc) fall between 60,050 and 150, 000 words. This might seem like a wide range, but if you add all the books written by all authors together, you'll see that it adds up to that range. The majority of popular fiction novels don't take more than 75,000 words to get the reader through. While the longest book ever written in English is Dostoyevsky's \"The Brothern Karamozov\", with 208,000 words,  the average book's word count hovers right around 60,044 words.

People in the Northern Hemisphere have blue skies in the morning because sunlight isn\u2019t bent downward near that point on the earth\u2019s surface.

The earth travels from west to east from day to night (daytime)\n\n### Answer:\n\n           1\n\n          The sun travels east and west everyday because of gravity pulling on it, causing it to circle one way. The earth stays in one place.\n\n          2\n\n        The earth travels to the east during the day. The sun travels to the west every night.

There are three variables, the answer is the one that is correct. For the question itself we have to answer the question, \"When a newborn' eyes open for the first times it will be the first....\". There are multiple answer options available.\nThe options we are given are:\n- See light: The light comes into the newborn babies eyes for the first time when it is born. The baby is able to see from that moment.\n- Tear up: Not all the time, but in most newborns the eyes will tear up at some point when they are first born.\n\n- Be happy: Yes, the baby will be happy when it is born, for it knows no better.\n- Glass over: This means that the baby's eyes are unable to see, for whatever reason.\n\n- Fill with tears: This answer is wrong as well, the water inside the eyes of the newborn baby is already filled with water and nothing can change that.\n\nAfter taking these variables into consideration we can conclude the correct answer is \"Tear up\".

However, when most people think of blinking lights at night, they are usually envisioning traffic lights or an airplane.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nA: **Carnival**\n\nWhen a person goes to the carnival, usually late at night, there are blinking lights.  These blinking lights create illusions of movement, like a roller coaster going up and down, or games or rides going forward and backward.\n\nB: **Plane**\n\nOne of the biggest causes of blinking lights in the sky is an airplane.  These planes often blink lights when there are no other sources that could be causing blinking lights.  People can tell that they are probably looking at blinking lights from an airplane when it is in a clear night sky and there is no other source of lights.\n\nC: **Concert**\n\nWhen a concert is going on late at night, the stage often has blinking lights on it.  During a concert, the stage lights are important to setting the tone of the music, so the artists have them on throughout their performance to light up the stage.  Blinking lights can also be seen around the audience.  This can help make the concert more interesting or give off the impression that the stage is somehow moving as they dance or dance around the stage.\n\nD: **Turned at night**\n\nSometimes in cities, at night, there are lights that are turned on because it is dark.  These lights can look like a single light source, but they are often made up of many different lights around a single area, so for each of these light sources, there is a reflection.  It is these reflections that cause blinks in people's eyes late at night, while they are walking around.\n\nE:", "answer": "B: plane"}

If you speak the problem, write down everything you say that pertains to the problem. Write down numbers, like 5, or qualifiers, like \"smaller\" or \"larger\".

Maybe you are reading over and over and the text looks like a foreign language. Maybe there isn't enough information to make a connection. Whatever the case, write down your confusion.\n\nOnce everything is written down, go through the problem again, line by line.

The person who was surprised would likely feel relieved because they are no longer the center of attention or the focus of the story. The person who had just been told would feel embarrassed. They would not understand why they were told after everyone else. They may feel frustrated or angry.

These instruction might include but are not limited to time limits and deadlines.\n\n|\nBoredom, patience and time should not be confused with pacing.

Therefore, \"home to a bustling [fishing industry]\" and \"home to a b... [fishing industry]\" can be assumed to be the same thing and interchangeable.\n\n### Your Answer:\nBecause the correct answer is choice C\n\n### What is your justification for this answer?\n\nHome to a bustling industry is an instance of a bustling fishery.\n\n### Response from Tutor:\nThe answer is correct. The task asks about the first sentence which says: \"The shore was now a resort attraction with nearby little stores, but at one time it was home to a bungling fishing industry\"\nThe key term here is industry, which refers to a field of work or commerce. Home to a bustling what? A shoe industry? A topiary industry? A fisher industry? Obviously, these industries cannot all be true, since they are clearly all different areas of commerce. However, at one time, it was home to a *bustling* fishing industry. This phrase tells us that the fisheries flourished in the past.\n\n\n### Question:\nBelow is an instruction that describes what needs to be done with some additional information supplied to complete the request.

{"text": "Answer A:\nNotice the two words \"at least\" and \"one.\" We see these a lot in the Coding Interview. Let's think about what they mean. A sentence with the word \"all\" means that something is true of all the members of the group. In this case \"all\" means all people. But, \"at least\" means that the thing described (in this case equipment) is true of one or more people. So, if we make the statement \"all people at dicks sporting goods will need sports equipment,\" we can break that down into its two parts.\n\n\"all\" --> \"one\"\n\"people at dicks sporting\" --> \"sporting goods\"\nor\n\n\"all people\" --> \"sportings good\" -> \"at least sporting goods\" -> \"doing a sport\"\n\nWhen we break apart the sentence, we see that for every one person who is at dick's sporting goods, they are doing a sport.

Then, you make the answer 80. \n\n2.Start off with the 4x the 20. Then, you add on double the original amount. So the answer is then 46.\n\n3.Start off with the initial amount of 330 and multiply it by.53. You then subtract that answer to get 168.5. And then you divide the answer by 2 and then get the answer of 84.25. And then you go back to 67 because that is two fewer than 84. Then you subtract the new 84.26 and that gives you the new 83.74. \n\n4.Start off with 110. You multiply that number by 4. The answer is 440. Take out the answer, 110. This gives you the amount of 337.  \n\n5.Start off with the original 110. Double that number to give you the amount of 220. Then, multiply that by 8 which is twice, then you divide it by 7 which is half. When you do this, you are going to get 328. You take off the original 112 which is what you started with. Thus giving you 256. You take 4/5 of the 17 to give you 10. Then, you take 3 times the 7 which is 21. Then, you multiply that by 6 which is half the number again. You then subtract the answer of 126 to get 234. And then multiply it by 5/3 of 234. That gives you 272.\n\n6.Start by using the number of 64. Multiply that by 6 to get 408. You take off 408 which gives you 8. Add that to the 32 to get 316. Take 25% of the 316 which gives you 79. And then you multiply", "answer": "A: store"}

(use r = rate of climbing (ft/min) and s = height (ft))\n\n### Response A: \n\nThe building with the 16 ft ladden has a rate of acceleration of 5 ft/s = 45ft/min. The 18 ft ladden climbs at a rate of 4.8 ft/s = 0.056676666667 ft/second.

He has a car with 150,000 miles on it. In case your mother doesn't let you have it, your grandparents also own a car. They could probably give it to you, but your uncle would like to drive it as an alternative. He only needs it for a few weeks to look for housing so that he and his girlfriend can live together while deciding to rent or buy a house.\n\nYou could drive the car, but you'd have to fix one small problem: the trunk lock is broken. You asked someone to fix it, but he couldn't do it. Your uncle needs to get to a job interview in a week; he's worried that if the car doesn't start soon he can't afford to fix the lock himself. He only needs to rent a lock so he can fix it himself if it isn't repaired by then. If he can't fix it, he'll need to rent another car to drive.\n\nHe also needs money to keep driving the car if he can't fix the trunk lock. Your cousin loaned him money, but he has to pay her back in 5 days and doesn't have money. Your aunt has offered him the money he needs to borrow, but she only offers it on the condition that you can't take it away, which you won't do. She doesn't want him to take it though because she thinks he really only needs the loan to get the trunk lock fixed and then it should be repaired before his deadline. She also says that's not much money for your uncle to live on after he pays all his bills, unless he rents a room. She offers him this money too, but on condition that it doesn't last more than a month because he needs to save on rent if he hopes to buy a house with his girlfriend by the end of the year.\n\n#### Task:\n\nYou need to convince your mother to give your uncle her car.

Is there any evidence that this happens?\n\nDemonstration:\n\nThis is a topic that can be debated. The demonic possession is considered to mean a person is taken over by the forces of evil. There are many examples throughout history that demonic possession has occurred. For these examples, there is a person who goes through a change in their personality, or a change in their physical state. These changes are usually a result of the spiritual attacks or influences. The demonic possession can occur without a person knowing it.\n\nTo summarize the case of demonic spirits, the case of demonic possession is an issue of beliefs.\n\nThe possession or taking over of a body by evil spirits can be understood in psychological terms. Evil spirits or spirits of demons are also not only seen in Christian circles but also in many cultures.\n\nDemonism is an occult practice which asserts the existence of evil spirits or demons that will take control of the body or mind of a human being, and can harm both the victim and anyone near the victim.\nDemons are spirits believed to appear as human beings who have died but are in a state of torment.\n\nHowever, not every religious tradition accepts the concept of demons.\n\n### Additional question:\n\nIn your mind, do ghosts exist?\n\n### Democracy is an idea you may or may not have heard of. What is this term?\n\nDemocracy is a form of government where all people have a voice in how they are governed. The principle of democracy is based on the idea that all people are equal and deserve to have a say in the decisions that affect their lives.\n\nA democracy is a government in which the people have the supreme power.

Since there is  is a specific location in which the leg is building, the criminal would need to pick another location other than jail.\n\nWe can eliminate \"building\" from our answer possibilities. Building includes all the buildings, a jail or a police car or a school or any kind of building. The answer would not be allowed for \"building\".\n\nNext we can eliminate \"blacksmith's shop\" because the blacksmith is a specific business and it doesn't make sense for there to just be one location of the blacksmith's.\n\nThe answer can only be \"D: Building\" or \"E: Bar\" because for \"building\" it could be one building or multiple locations or a specific building. We don't know how many bars or buildings nor do we know the exact location. We know it wasn't jail or the internet cafe because that is where the robbery would have taken place.\n\nBecause we do not know a specific location of the leg assembly we have to pick one of the two options provided.\n\n### Ivy:\nWe can immediately eliminate a few possible answers. The first is, \"jail\" or \"A: jail\", because if it were a jail the criminal would have been arrested. The next possible answer choice is \"building\" which would be any kind of building, such as a house or a library. It would make no sense for only one \"building\" to have legs built on it, as it could be that multiple buildings had stools built on them. Next, we can see that \"blacksmith' shops\" are no longer possible, as it would be strange that one single \"blacksmith' shop\" was the only place with its legs assembled. Finally, we can see that the building is not a bar, because a bar is just one specific building and you would not see its legs assembled.  This limits us with the answers down to two, which are either \"building\" or \"bar\".\n\nNow, it really just comes down to the fact that if \"building\" were allowed as an answer choice, we would have to be specific and give an example of which one.

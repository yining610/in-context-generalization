It's easy to fall into a trap of thinking that teachers are all the same, and so if you have a problem with a different type of education, that's the same problem for everyone else.  But since no two learners are exactly the same, neither are their goals, desires, and motivations.\n\n#### Discussion:\nHow do I teach my students to be better students?\n\n#### Practical Steps:\nThroughout the process of learning, there are many decisions that have to be made by students and teachers, one of which is what specific tools will be best to use for them for different assignments.

{"text": "The diagram below shows how much of the intersection road is used when at a red light.  The light on the city street intersection will stay green for 15 seconds then turn yellow for 60 seconds then red for 35 seconds.  The intersection that has a fork in it will have the intersection change which way cars can travel depending on which path they choose.  The intersection to the street corner will have a green light 40% of the time.  The car on the street corner will wait in a straight line at a stop sign.  Finally, cars on the country intersection will wait for people to cross the street, and then there will be a green light for a short time depending on how many people there are and if they are moving quickly or slowly at the crosswalk.  The answer to where people are likely to want to stand at this intersection is that they will want to stand at the car that is waiting at the stop sign.  They will be waiting in straight line with the rest of the cars that are waiting at the intersection that has the fork in it and are not blocked by cars driving from all directions.\n\n### Input:[7](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vf61hxhj2z1ihnf/T18.png?dl=0)\n\n### Response:[![Image description](/img/0026/T18.gif)](/img/0025/T18.jpg)Here, the city street intersection is not used a lot of times because the light that they have is a red/green light that has a 3 second period of red.  This may cause the light to change from the direction someone is trying to go in before they even get a chance to get there.  They will likely be going to get through the red light, just to be behind the person that was already trying to get through.  The intersection to city street has another problem as well where the car that has the red/green light, only has enough light shown to where there is more white in the middle of the intersection.  The people will likely want to avoid this intersection, because they may not see if there is a car in the intersection that is trying to get through before they get there.  The intersection that starts to turn green will only go green to the 40% area.  This is not enough to turn all the cars coming from the one", "answer": "C: street corner"}

Functions are composed of a parameter, a body and a return/output.  Here is an Example of defining a `Function`.\n\nA function that will return the given parameter but will double it and return the result.\n```js\nfunction fn(param){\n    this.value= param*2;\n    this.doIt=this.value;\n    return this;\n}\n```\nHere is an example of defining a function.\n```js\n\nfunction addTwoNumbers(num1,num2){\n    console.log(num1,num1);\n    let res=num1+num2;\n    console.log('sum',res);\n    return res;\n}\n\nfunction addThreeNumbers(num1, num2,num3){\n    console.dot(num1,num3);\n    let res = num1- num2;\n    console..log('diff',res);\n    num1+num3 = res;\n    console.warn('diff',num1,num2,num3);\n}\n```\nNotes:\n\n* When defining a function, we need an object and the function's name.\n```js\nlet f1=function(name){\n    console.warn(name);\n    return 'hi there';\n}\n```\n\n* As seen here, the object is the scope of execution of the function.\n```js  \nobj1.addOne =f1;\nlet x = obj1.addOne('name');\nconsole.warn(x)\n```\n\n* When we are calling a function we use the function.\n\n```js\nlet res = obj1.addTwo(num1,num_2,num3); // addTwo(x, num_3)\n```\n\n# Section 2 Explanation\n\n```js\n// * * *\nconst obj={\n    name:'john',\n    firstName:'John',\n    addValue :function (i){\n        this.name= `Hi!

The gentalman is wealthy, so living in Europe would make sense because it tends to be more expensive.\n\n### Input\nA group of 434 people decided to split costs on a bill. They each owe $124. 124 has digits in common with 43  and 4 times as many digits as 54.  If the number of people was divisible evenly into the number of digits in each bill, how many remained each time each bill was divided?\n\n### Response\nAnswer:\n15\n\n### Exposition\nThe question implies that there are four digit numbers in each bill, so it is saying that the number of digits in the bill is equal to how many people are splitting it. If that were the case, then the answer would be 12. So, the number of people have be be evenly divisible by 10 to represent a bill. There are 3 divisors of 12: 1, 2 and 3. There are an infinite amount of divisors of 10.

The easiest way to determine how to adjust it is to subtract 10 from 40 to see that you have an equation with 30 and a division of 9. In order to simplify this, you can reduce 30, since it has no exponent, to an integer: 30= 3. You then take 10 off of the top of 9, and you have a quotient of 9/9, or 1.

{"text": "B \n\n### Notes:\nThe first thing you will need to do is use logical reasoning to eliminate at least two answers. If you are unsure of what an answer might be then eliminate it as well. From what I can assume, this question is not asking for what stops someone from getting sleep. Instead, it asks what they think of during the night. A might possibly be the only answer that could be correct, but a quick elimination would tell you that B, C and D cannot be the answer.\n\n### Next, you will need to think of all the words that could represent a person\u2019s nightmares.  It is likely the \u201chave\u201d will not be able to be eliminated, or if it is, it won\u2019t be one of the answers given.  The question refers to \u201cnightmares\u201d, so we are looking for \u201cbad dreams\u201d.  Therefore, if you were to think of all the things that could happen in your life it would be a nightmare.\n\n### After, we need to eliminate sleeping from the answers. This will likely mean that your answer is E, which is the last part of the question. \n\n### Then once you know your answer, you will need to apply an extra set of rules to find the correct answer of E. You will be given a situation in which two people do not share the same opinion, so the first step is to ask yourself who thinks this is wrong and who thinks the opposite.  As soon as you do this, the answer can be found in the rest of the sentence.\n\n### Answer:\nThe answer will be E.

{"text": "Answer: B. The millpond is a lake made by building a dam. Hence, the beaver can make a dam to form a millpond that destroys the machine by impeding the running of it. It is therefore, wrong to say that the beaver destroyed the machine by building the dam in the strip club. Beaver was not thinking of the strip club. It was about the water. Hence, the beafer should be blamed for building the dam in the lakes, rivers or millponds. A beaver would not damage the dam or think of it, let alone consider the machines. Therefore to build a dam in the strip club is not the best option, unless the owner has agreed. The strip club is meant for adults as confirmed by law. So there would be no problem.

{"text": "The answer is Canada \n\n### Input-Output:\nInput:\nInput 10 people into a room that has no chairs.\nInput 10 more people into the room.\nIf 5 people stand up each minute and 2 people sit down each minute, find the amount of time until all chairs are being used.\nOutput: 180\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Input 10 people into the room. \n  -  Output 35 minutes. \n2. Input 10 more people\n  -  Output: 300 minutes\n3. Input 5 people standing up and 2 sitting down each minute\n  -  Output. 180 minutes\n\n### Instructor's Notes:\nThis is a classic brainteaser.  The solution is actually quite counterintuitive.  While inputting more people into the room can decrease the number of minutes until chairs are taken, it will never decrease below 180.  This is because the problem is describing a scenario where there are too many people in the room.  Since there cannot be too many chairs, and with each extra person there is at most one less chair, 180 is the final result.  The instructor should first describe the logic behind the algorithm and then execute the problem.  Once the instructor's explanation is clear the instructor can follow through with the process of inputting new people, which will take 180 minutes.  The students should watch this carefully to ensure they understand the logic.\n\n### Solution:\nInput: \nIf you input people and calculate the time remaining, it will always be in minutes.  I used 99999 to replace the minutes to ensure the calculation is finished.  The amount of time between each person getting a chair is 2 people because 2 people are sitting down each minute and 2 are standing up.  Since I put one person in each second, it takes 60 seconds to complete the process, which is 1 minute.\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Input 2:\nInput 40 people into a room with no chairs.\nIf 1000 chairs are brought in and distributed, \nhow many chairs will there be in the room?\n\n<br><Br>\n##", "answer": "B: north pole"}

It does, of course, have to do with stopping, but it would be more appropriate if he had to choose the part that would \"help me stop\" or \"make me stop faster,\" or something more like that. However, the question specifically mentions that the car is coming to a \"light,\" which means that, to us, that it is a \"signaled\" red, that needs to be treated \"like a stop sign.\" To some, it might be considered part of a longer, slower stretch of road.\n\nIn this case, with the context of a \"light\" as in the beginning of this response, the only answer that makes sense is \"Breaks.\" That is the literal meaning of the word \"light.\"\n\nAs far as the other choices, \"Tires,\" for example, are used only on certain roads as needed, and \"Stripes\" would be unlikely to help you stop at all, while \"Seat Belts\" and \"Radios\" sound like they would be more related to the \"comfort of the ride,\" but not in any way the stopping of the vehicle.\n\n\"Seat Belts\" can be said to \"reduce the impact of collision and may protect the body from abdomen damage.\" (\"Corns.\" n.d.) It also keeps you awake. Seat belts would not stop you from hitting a barrier, however, which is the point of the question, unless the barrier was a \"belt barrier.\"\n\n\"Break pads\" in cars make breaking easier. \"Brake Rotors\" also help you stop the car more quickly by slowing you down quicker, but the only part of them that help you stop are the \"Brake pads.\"\n\n\"Radios\" are used to help you enjoy the ride while sitting in traffic, and \"Stripe patterns\" would either slow you down by confusing other cars coming at you, or simply remind drivers they are not supposed to drive 90 miles per hour on a road that is a \"stretch of quiet parkway.\"\n\n\"Seat belts\" are used to keep you in the car in an accident, but not used to make you stop if the light turns red.\n\n\"Tires\" are what your car", "answer": "C: breaks to help stop"}

The sentence \"Where would someone be likely TO store a double edge razors?\" could not be answered by a single word. Also there are some obvious grammatical and spelling errors. A would be a strange place to store something like this and would be quite obscure.B is incorrect because the phrasing \"Would someone be likely TO store...\" does not match with the words in the description. \"Would someone be\" needs to have more detail about what the person is doing or being asked. In the given description he is not storing it.B would be incorrect because this phrase would need to modify \"in the shower\", changing it to \"Shower, where would someone be likely to...\", but this does not match the given phrase\"Where would someone be likely...\". C is incorrect because \"chemist\" is not one of the given options. The description states \"a chemist (like a drug store)\". The options given are all places to be likely to find such an item. Chemist is not one of these options.D is incorrect because \"drug store\" is not one of options given. D would be incorrect because the description states \"a drug store (like a chemist)\". D is also incorrect because the given phrase \"...be likely to...\", is missing from a drug store would be correct.E is correct because it is an option given. E matches the description by stating \"Where would someone be LIKELY to store...\".

The next magazine to be published was the Gentleman's Magazine in 1731. This was then followed by various religious and political magazines. Magazines like The Spectator and The Tatler took off in popularity in the 1700s and 1800s, but in 1894, the most significant magazine of that time, Vogue was introduced to the public.\n\nThe first magazine to be printed in America was the American Magazine for a very long time and the popularity of the publication was a reflection of society and fashion at that time.\nAt a time when America was a young nation, the country's people expressed themselves in its magazines.\nVogue Magazine has been publishing since 1894.

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions:Choose the answer choice that tells the correct definition of the underlined prefix or suffix.\n\n### Suffixes\n\n  * A: Prefixes and suffixes are different things.\n\nSu: A: Prefixes are used at the start of a word and suffixes are used at the end of a word to make a new word which does not exist.  For example:  the word \"fiction\" is a created word that is made from the prefix \"fi\" and the suffix \"ion\".  Thus, it does not exist in the language originally.  \"Fiction\" does not start with the prefix \"f\" while the word \"fact\" does start with the letter \"f\". Another example is \"friend\" and \"frustration\" and \"friendship\".  The difference between them is that the word \"friendship\" has the letters \"ship\" at the end which means the word exists in the language.  \"Friendship\" was made from the letters \"friend\" and the suffix \"ship\" which means the word was made through forming the word \"friendship\". \"Frustration\" has no created word that is formed from the letters \"frust\".  \"Frustration\" is a new word that does not exist in language.  It is formed from the letters of the word \"frustration\" with the prefix \"frust\" and the suffix \"tion\".\n\n  * B: A prefix is a word part attached to a word root, while a suffix is a word part attached at the end of the word; a prefix usually changes the word into a different part of speech, while a suffix often changes the word into a tense, an adjective, or an adverb\n\nSuf: C: Prefixes\n\n  * C: Prefixes are added to the beginning of words or root to determine its meaning or role in a sentence.  For a prefix to change the meaning of a word, it has to function as a word itself.  The prefixes are not usually verbs which means words are not changed when the prefixes are attached to it.  Some examples are: \"re\", \"anti\", \"ab\", \"pre\" which are examples of prefixes that are commonly used. These three prefixes can actively function as a word in their own.  But these prefixes cannot change the definition of the words without it being separated from the roots", "answer": "C: remarkable"}

And then 1, 2... -2, -4, -8, -16.. You can see there is a pattern here. That is because the pattern is this: 1, 2.. 1, 2 to the power of two, so, uh, the second number is two... And that\u2019s when a binary number wraps around to zero, from, from two to one to zero, two to one to zero. And two to the power of three wraps around to eight and then it will start at negative eight. Five to the power of three would be wrapping around to 15, I\u2019m sorry 16 and then wrapping around to one, which would make, negative 16. So here is five, we\u2019ll start a negative zero five zero, and then we\u2019ll start here on five 0 1 for the first time. Three 0 1 2 3 0 1, then you go back to five... so this is actually a repeating cycle.  Every 2nd number is a negative number. After you go down past five, your wraparound is still going down, but is always 1, then eventually wraparou.

Each person has the same chance of winning after each spin, so they will collectively have the same amount of possible results after 3 spins. (AAA) The chance to AAA is 1/6. So AAA means they all win.(BAB) The chance to BAB is 1/6+1/6*1/6. It is 1/24. So BAB means they all lose. Since the chances to each outcome is equally high, they all should have the same amount in their pockets after each spin. Then they should have the same amount after the 3rd spin too. This outcome comes from: AAA. Hence, they win all their spins.(ABA) The chance to BAA is 1/5*1/6+1*2/6. It is (1/5)*(1/6)+(1/5)*1/6+(1/5)*1. It is 56/315. So BAA means they all win.

Which chair has the largest distance between the top of the chair the top of the head of the person sitting in it?

The plate on the first car is one digit long and begins with an even number. The plates on all dark blue cars are odd. The last car's plate begins with two even numbers. What is the most likely color of the last car?\n\n### Response Choices: A: dark blue B: silver C: red\nThis is a trick question with 3 different correct responses. We assume our original question is asking for the least or most likely color.  If our question asked for most likely, then we would most likely choose red.  However if we asked which is the least likely car, we would most likely want to select dark blue.  For the first answer, there are 7 total possible dark blue cars and 1/3 of those are odd, giving us 2/7 odd dark blue cars.  For the second answer, of those odd dark blue cars, 1/3 of them are 6 digits, which makes the number 20.  One might think, \"Well, if it starts with an odd number and is a dark blue car, it is probably a 2-digit plate which leaves 17 possibilities\", but those are all dark blue which leaves only the even number possibilities.  Therefore, the answer for most likely would be red, because of the least possible amount of dark blue cars\n\n### Exactly", "answer": "E: inaccurate"}

The children could be the orphan's, but the children aren't an orphan in the context. The children could also be orphans themselves, in which case, they would be a separate group from the orphan they are being described as part of.

Jorah takes a 200-minute bus ride to school.  How long is the combined total time the four students spend on their journey to school? Does the time total one hour?\n<p style=\"background-color:white;text-align:justify\">The first group of statements tells only us how much they walk to and from school each day respectively. So we can sum up the total minutes traveled to school for just two of the group of children who take a 5-min walk and a 5 bike ride to and from school and for the remaining two we have no idea.  This information tells us that Jorah commutes on a bus for about 200 minutes.  Now let's talk about the combined total for all four.  Because there is a total of 230 minutes and we know about 225 minutes are traveled to and from 25 minutes must be to school.  Therefore we can know the first two group of children have a total commute time of 1 hour.  That means Jorah takes a total transportation time of 230 mins and 1 hour to school.

The shelf holds 15 books where the total pages are 205.  How many pages are in one of the books?\n\nAnswer: 14\n\nInput: A book has 288 pages.  The number of letters in the alphabet is 26.  If each letter of a book's 288 pages is assigned to the matching letters, how many letters of a page will be used?\n\nAnswer: A page would take 1 letter from each of the 26 letters.\n\n### Output:\nAnswer: 26\n\nOutput: Every story in a book has a specific number of parts.  The first part of the story always has number 1.   The second story only has 2 parts.  The last story is usually the biggest, with 20 parts.  The rest lie between 1 and 20.  A chapter's numbering is 0.62 times whatever it is in the final story, with a possible half.  How many parts does book chapter 8 have?\n\n### Inputs\nInput: The bus stops at the bus station every 8 seconds. The bus leaves the train station every 60 seconds and drives towards the school. The bus drive takes 4 times as long as the driver. If there are no delays, how long does it take to drive to the school?\n\nAnswer: The bus leaves at 60 seconds and is gone in 4 times that at 240 seconds.  To get to the school, it goes at a rate of 8 seconds and makes 30 stops.  A total of 240 seconds - 30, or 240 seconds minus 30 equals 210 seconds.  The answer would then be 210 x 16 (number of minutes in an hour) to the answer.  Therefore, the answer is then 3,440 minutes.", "answer": "A: pocket"}

Choices: 1:12\n\n### Response\n\n12\n\n## Solutions\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice questions.\n\n### Demo:\nInput: The man stands behind a wall of height `1.5` feet. His friend stands at the other side of the wall, facing him. If the man stands one foot to the left, then he reduces the distance between them to about 5 feet. How many feet long is this wall?\n\nThe man can only move by either standing, or moving quickly.  Since the only options are to stand, move (and hence, stand quickly), or walk, the man must stand (he must not move).\n\nThus, the total distance between the two men is `5` feet.  We also know that for there to be a `4` foot distance between the two men, the man must be facing the wall in `1.5` foot increments.\n\nHence, `1.5` is the correct height of the wall, based on the given premise.\n\nInput: The distance between two cities is 5 times the speed of sound.   The same speed of light. This means that both cities will be 29 miles apart when the speed of light decreases to half of its current value.   The speed of sound does not change so 29 miles will always be the distance as long as neither city moves faster than light (50% of current speed).\n\nWe are given that `5 x speed of sound = distance between two cities`.   The premise implies that if the speed of light is doubled, so will the speed of sound.  Thus, this means that `5 x speed = distance.`.\n\nThus, if `speed` doubles, so will the distance be, and vice versa.\n\nIf we look at the premise that `5 x speed` equals `distance,`, then we see that, given that speed does not change, that the distance will remain `5` miles:\n\nThus, we can conclude that the distance is `5`, and that speed remains `c`.\n\nInput: It was 9 days ago when the rain and sun began to alternate.

{"text": "Shopping mall\n\n#### Explanation:\nThe question asks \"where could you find _____?\" and only school has to be a specific type of place. So since the other four options are just groups of people, that doesn't disqualify any locations. Hospitals don't have unpaid actors, so that's out. Populated areas don't have a military base, so Military base is out. Schools only have places where you can find actors or actresses, so (B) stays in the running. But military bases do have a lot of people and so does a shopping mall. Neither of them has actors. The question is worded poorly, if I were editing the question, I would change the \"theater\" to \"theater troupe\" to see if that helps narrow things down. In addition, it should say where you would find these. All theaters can have actors, just some types of theater can only have paid actors.\n\n### Exercise:\n1.

The combined ages of the father and son are 83.  By what age will the son be 20 years ago?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Father is 30 years old at the time of the question.  The son isn't specified, so he could be anything from 60 to 0.  If you assume he was 16, then we can say this:\n\nAge(Father) = 30\nAge(Son)   = 30 + 16 = 46\nAge(Father + Son) = Age(Son) + Age(Father) =  83\nAge(Son ) =   83 - Age(Father) which when solved is:  3(83) - (30)2 = 104\n\nNow this answer doesn't take into account how the father ages, he could have been a father at any age, and the question does not state that the father was 30 when the son is 16.\n\n\\$ Age(Father) - Age(Son)\\$ would be:  83 - 104 = -21\nFrom here, you will see where the -21 comes from when subtracted from the number, it becomes -8 (assuming the father was 31 originally) which will always become a negative number, no matter how the numbers are played around with.  So in actuality, this would give: \n\n-8 + 104 + 30 = 76\n\nAnswer: The father is 54 years old, and the son is 17.   76 years in the future, the son will be 30, and the father will be 96 years old.\n\n### Review:\nDictionaries in Python\n\nA dictionary, also known as a key-value store, is a collection of key-value pairs stored in a hash table.

The women\u2019s areas often include a carpeted floor and the men often wear tefillin, so floors are always kept clean for holy purposes.\n\n### Input\nA student paid $3.50 for a textbook, bought a calculator for $36, and paid tax on the purchase with a 10% tax rate.  The student then sold the calculator for $44.  If the student received $2.26 for the book, what did the student make or lose on the deal?\n### Response\nThe student made $ 2.26\n\n### Answer\nThe student made $2.26.  We can do this problem using either simple interest or compound interest.  We should first use compound interest and calculate the amount of money the student made or lost by compound interest.   We can use the formula of = (C - T) and we are given, C = 2.26, T = -3.50  and therefore c = 8.06.  This is easy to understand.  In the interest column we add all the numbers on the bottom.  The money left in the wallet, which we have on the top, is $8.06. Therefore, the student made $8.06\n\nWe should also do the same problem using simple interest, = (P - R).  We know the number of dollars the student paid = P = 22.84.  We also know R= -10% =.10.  We can solve this using.10*(22.84) which is the student\u2019s 23 dollars in the wallet.  We then just subtract this from the total in the wallet of 22.83.  We should get a final number of -1.83.  Because the negative sign is in front of the number, this represents a negative number given to the student.  It represents the number of dollars that was lost.  8.06 - 1.83 is 6.23.  -3.50 = 6.23 so the student made 2.73.  Remember that the student made 22.8, and lost", "answer": "E: synagogue"}

It may very well damage the person who was wearing it. It wouldn't protect anyone from a cannone. \n\n### Response : The projectile would not burn a hole or two through a bomber jacket.

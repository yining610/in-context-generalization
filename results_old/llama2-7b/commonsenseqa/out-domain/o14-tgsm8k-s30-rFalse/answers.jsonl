She is looking for a different option.\n\nHowever, the answer choices are not presented in an order or any type of correlation to the clues, so choice D \"storage\" might be easier to eliminate first.\n\nThe clue that James feels too loud leads to Alexa thinking about an idea to get an acoustic instead of electric.  The words \"a studio\" are used by Alexa at the end of the sentence, \"In fact,  maybe a studio is the place where you should go when you are buying  your instrument,\" which eliminates choice A \"house\" and choice B \"music shop\"\n\nTo eliminate choices D \"storage\" and B \"music shop\" we can think of where might Alexa store a guitar, and most likely it would be a closet.

{"text": "The correct answer is a. There are wild lemurs that live in Madagascar.\n\n### Inputs: Aaron, age 23, is driving down the road. The sign says the suggested speed limit is 35 miles per hour. If he drives at that rate, how many hours does it take for him to drive 85 miles?\n\n### Response 1a:  The correct answer is b. The sign is saying that a 35mph speed limit is suggested for traveling 35 miles per hours, or 35 x 1 = 35, which means every hour he travels 35 miles. Dividing 35 by 4(number of hours in a day), we get 7.5/4 = 1.875 or 1 + 8/7. Now he only needs to subtract to get 21/4 hours or almost 5 hours to travel 85 miles as a total.\n\n### Response1b:  The correct answer b, just like the previous example, is because the sign says \"suggested speed limit\".

For the 8-block distance from his house to the store, an average speed of 15 miles per hour is reasonable. Kyle spends 7 dollars on a pencil case. His friend Alexa, who lives 6 miles away from the store, takes the bus. Her bus fare is 35 cents. How many pencils will a dollar buy?\n\n### Response\nI'm not sure there is enough information to solve to question completely. In order to solve this, I used a ratio comparison between Alexa's bus fare and her bus distance (6 miles).

You are asked to help them determine their risk to make good loans and are told that their policy is currently to give a loan to half a borrower's applications.

This function should calculate the cost of renting a car for a specified number of days, the number of days being the first argument to the function. The argument for the number of days should be a number representing the number of days the renter will keep the car. The argument for calculating the cost should be a string that represents how the renter wishes to pay for the rental. Allowed value for payments that can be found within the car rental agency are \u201cDay-to-day,\u201d \u201cWeekly,\u201d \u201cOne-and-a-half weeks,\u201d \u201cOne month,\u201d \u201cSix months,\u201d and \u201cMonthly.\u201d If the payee does not make a special selection and chooses to go with whatever the default payment will be, they may be charged more than the standard cost for the rental. For instance, the default payment might be \u201cOne-and-A-half weeks,\u201d which is the cost of renting the car for one and a half weeks. If on the other hand, the renter chooses to pay \u201cMonthly,\u201d they will be charged more than the rental cost (a down payment plus the first month\u2019s payment) because they are renting for two months before making the next payment.\n\n### Challenge:\n> Create a second function that will calculate the expenses of renting a house.

If it falls off when the car is traveling at the speed that it does, it will bounce off the car from being on the back of the car. What maximum height may it reach?\nAnswer: 0.50 ft.\n\nCar 1 is traveling in the same direction as Car 2, and 0.20 miles ahead of the car. Car 2 must honk to let Car 1 know that their distance has become too small for the cars to safely pass each other. If the distance is allowed to get a little smaller, the cars are still able to pass each other safely. How close may Car 2 come to Car 1 without honking?\nAnswer: 90 ft.\n\nThe graph shows three different points traveling at constant speed. They are connected by straight lines. Which of the lines shown are parallel?\n```All 3\n```\n\n## Assignment:Complete the coding activity.\n\n### Background:What you need:\n\n-   Java IDE (intelliJ, Eclipse, or other)\n\n### Coding Activity:\nCreate a program that calculates distance.

{"text": "Not Noticeable\n\n### Input/Output:Grocery stores have some fixed costs to keep operating (like rent), but most of their costs depend on how many units they make and sell. The only fixed portion of the costs is rent, though. So a small store spends 50% its income to rent, and a big store spends 100%. The cost per unit of rent is the same for both stores. It's the same per square foot in the same store. It's the exact same in the little store. If they sell exactly the same number of units, what is the percentage of income to cover fixed costs when the stores each sell the same number of units?\n\nInput: A small store has 100% rent and a big store has 10% rent. The big store could sell half the number of units, and have the same income as the small store. If the big store sells its number of units per month, it will have the same income as in the month before.

He wanted to be the winner and thought everyone could be enemies.\n\n### Input\nAnswer the following question: Which is faster, a zebra or a lion, in a race of 2 miles?\n\n### Response\n\nWhile the lion may be faster than a zebra, the lion could also use better strategy to overtake a zebra, who often is much faster on narrow tracks. On a track it is difficult for a 300 lb lion to beat a 400 lb zebra. There are 2 factors to consider. 1) The strength of the lion and 2) How quickly the lion can run on a track.\n\n### Explanation: It's not an uncommon question to ask, \"Which is faster, a cheetah or lion?\" or \"Which is faster a cheetah or zebra?\"  It's a good question and the answer depends upon how you are defining \"fastest\" among the animals concerned, which is the \"strongest\" of the animals concerned, where each animal takes place in a habitat most conducive to their abilities, and so on.  To do it just right, you'd need a lot of parameters established regarding each animal before you could really make any kind of valid statement regarding who would win.  We're probably better off just admitting that an impossible question.\n\n## Trivia\nThe following trivia item(s) are provided to be used in conversation.

In each direction, he drives 2 hours, sells his product, and drives home.  Because the salesman always takes the same route to get to the markets, the only variation will occur in the time he is driving, once in one direction and once in the other.  To give you an example, he first spends 1 hour visiting one market, then drives back.  He then spends 3 hours visiting his next market, and then drives back at a cost of 1 hour.  He finally spends 2 hours at his final destination.  Thus, his 5-hour day consists of 1 hour for driving to and from one market and 3 hours at one of the markets.

It is important to make sure she is somewhere relatively convenient and safe in each location.\n\nThe locations will be a museum, a store, and a park.\nThe museum is the most difficult place to travel to since we have to take an elevator down three levels to get there.\n\nThe park is in the middle of a neighborhood and there is nothing particularly noteworthy about the area, so it would be inconvenient to travel there since we'd have to walk with the cat and would be in the middle of a busy neighborhood.

{"text": "A\n\n### Input\nThe microphone used in the news broadcast is likely to be a handheld microphone for the announcers used.\n\n### Response\nExplanation:\n\nThe microphone that is used for the studio announcers in most cases is a hand microphone that is held and operated by the\ntalent for the particular news broadcast.  The boom microphone on the other hand is used in the studio and is used along with a high\nquality microphone.  The microphone is raised from the studio, usually from a camera and then swung or boomed in front of the\ntalent.  The boom is often mounted on a long arm that allows the operator to swing the microphone in front of any talent that is\non camera.\n\nOne common type of microphone that is frequently used in the studios by announcers and other talk show personalities is\nan on-air microphone.  This microphone is very small and fits on the collar of the shirt worn by the talent.  The microphone\nis attached to the lapel and the mouth of the talent and is picked up by the microphone that is in the camera.  The only drawback\nto the on-air microphone is that the talent must be very close to the microphone for it to pick up the sound.  In some cases, the\nmic of the talent may go over the mouth but this is rare unless the talent has a big voice.\n\n### Input (Reverse Case):Where is a microphone used for the studio announcer? Choices: A: Concert B: News broadcast C: Tv studio D: Recording studio E: Gig\n\n### Response (Reverse Case):E\n\n### Explanation:\nAs the reader has seen in the case of the microphone described above, the microphone is used in a concert. When it is used\nin a recording studio, the microphone is usually used for the talent in the studio that is to be broadcast on the news.\nThe microphone is also used in a recording studio when an artist is doing a song live.  It is more commonly used in the recording studio by the talent rather than being boomed on the news broadcast.\n\nWhen a DJ is at a podium in the radio studio, usually, there is a microphone next to the podium that the DJ will talk into.", "answer": "A: new york"}

{"text": "I'm so excited to be going to a restaurant tonight, and I can't wait to see my friends. The only concern that I have is where the candle will go. You are right that it should not go in dimly lit rooms because it could cause a fire hazard. However, I don't think that the candle belongs in the kitchen either, because there is way too much going on in there for one thing. If you want to, feel free to look for a table, but we could also just put it on the cake. Let me know what you all are thinking.\n\nThis is a great piece of advice, thank you! We want to have the candle on the cake so the restaurant makes that happen for us!\n\n### Response\nI am pleased to hear that there will be cake at the party. The only thing that I really don't like about it is the candle that's on top of the cake. I'm afraid that they will catch it on fire or that one person will accidentally knock it over. I don't think it's a good idea to put the candle on a table, not because there is something scary about candles, but because too many things are going on around us in this restaurant. I agree that it is best to have the candle somewhere other than dimly lit rooms. Do you have any suggestions?\n\n### Response 2\n\nThank you for bringing up such a good point. In fact, your idea reminded me of a really good movie, Candle Jack. It's a story of a group of friends who try to figure out why the candle in a dark room is on fire until they end up finding out who is responsible for the fire. It is a funny movie because Candle Jack does not understand why he's so scared of getting people into trouble and goes to great lengths to cover his own behavior from other people. You have given me that same joy which I always get from Candle Jack. You make me think of that movie because the candle was in a very dark room and a child who was just born had to tell someone the secret. We don't want that to happen in this situation either. Do you have some other ideas for candles?\n\n### Instructions:What can you do to save more money?\n\n### Demofication", "answer": "D: table"}

How many evenings is that?\n\n### Response.\nThat is 5 evenings\n\n### Input\nWhat is two plus one?\n\n### Input response\nFour\n\nWe'll use the response to an out-of-order task to illustrate the first principle.  In the instruction, no two sentences have corresponding responses.  And the first two responses to questions could be either correct or incorrect, with the third response correctly distinguishing between the two choices. You could therefore say that there are two wrong and one right ways to answer two of the three questions.  Thus, the ratio of wrong to right responses is 2:1.  We also know that there are three right ways to answer the third question, so the ratio of right to wrong responses for this question is 3:0, since the question is impossible to get wrong.  So the problem description might look something like this:\n\n<img width=\"1200\" alt=\"21\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2075156/33333486-d76186e2-dda1-11e7-8414-170b2f270c9e.png\" />\n\n> #### \u2023\u2023  It is possible to analyze the difficulty of each task in two different ways: the order and number of responses to questions.\n\nWe could use this principle to find the ratio of wrong to correct responses in almost any context.  A task like \"Given an out-of-sequence question, correctly distinguish between two possible right responses\" can be reduced to two principles.  One, that there is an incorrect response (if there is no correct response, the ratio isn't useful).  Two, because there could be more than one correct response, the ratio will not be one.  If we let n be the number of different responses that may be correct, then the ratio is n-1.\n\n## 7.

{"text": "Fear is a natural and essential aspect of human life. The brain is designed to prepare us for danger, to protect us from harm. But sometimes, in certain situations the fear response can get turned on when there is no real danger involved.  \n\nThere are lots of ways to respond to fear. Some people run away. Some people hide. Some people try to fight or flight. They run away from the thing they're scared of, or they try to fight it off with all their might. They might run out the door, or they might fight against the thing they fear. \n\nBut we can also approach the fear and engage with it, to find out what it's really scared about.  When you face fear, the body releases a stress hormone called adrenaline.  When adrenaline binds to its target, it changes the physiology of the body. It increases heart rate, breathing and blood flow. Adrenaline also suppresses the appetite.\n\nAdrenaline is a powerful chemical that gives you a burst of energy and strength. Some people might feel that they need to drink less water when they're scared. They feel like they need to drink alcohol or other liquids to stay calm.  \n\nFear makes some of us urinate more, probably as a way to get rid of excess adrenaline. People may also get the urge to urinate after a frightening event. And it's not just humans who get wet after being scared. \n\nSome animals may get wet, including monkeys, rats, rabbits and other types of animals  \n\nSometimes we get wet after a bad experience.

{"text": "A\n\n### Explanation: Thrust of a throw comes from the height over which the object is thrown.\n\n### Input\nIn order to be able to throw a rock up high enough to make a big splashed you would need a lot of force behind the throw. That force would be derived from the mass of the rock times its velocity. In order to have a larger effect than throwing it straight in the air, we will have to take that gravity into account.\nBecause the river is on the ground below us, the mass of the rock below the surface is more likely to push it back down into the ground with a greater force than when it is thrown straight into the air.\nThat is why we will throw it up into the mountain.\n\n### Examples\n\nExplanation: This response is incorrect\n\n### InputIf you are driving your car, you move about 20 feet with each revolution of your wheels. 1000 feet per mile. How far do you go in ten revolutions of the wheels?\n\n### Response\n1000/20 = 50\n\n### Explination\n\nThe unit for speed, s, which means: distance per unit time. In this question, distance is expressed in feet, and the given unit of time is the revolution of the wheels. We would like the wheel to rotate exactly 10 times, so that each meter translates into exactly one foot. This means 10 meter revolutions of the wheel translates into 1000 revolutions of the wheel. Because the wheel rotates 10 times in 1 second, the wheel rotates at a rate of 10 meters per second.\n\n### Example\nExplanation:\n\n### Resources\n1.

The GDP per capita  is a measure of the average annual income or total output for each person in a given country. It\u2019s usually used to assess the standard of living in a country, on a per person basis. So, the country with the largest GDP per capita would be the \u201crichest\u201d country in the world. We often think of GDP as a measure of a country\u2019s prosperity \u2013 afterall, it has a reputation for being the best measure of a country\u2019 economic strength. The problem with this is that GDP doesn\u2019t tell us about differences in income between people within a country; it only tells us about total output. And what we know from economics is that you can get rich by exploiting workers. When you think of it like this GDP becomes quite an useless metric. So, let\u2019s look at GNI instead, which stands for gross national income. It can be calculated in a way that is closer to income per capita; not only taking into account the national output, but also income paid to citizens by residents of the rest of the world, like corporations and investors.\n\n### Response \n\nAgreed with the first sentence but disagree with the second. GNI (Gross National Income) is the standard metric of comparison for living standards between countries.\n\n### Instr: Answer the following multiple choice question\n\n### Demos:\n\nGross National Income (GNI) is the income of a country in a given year before indirect taxes are applied.\n\nAnswer: A\n\n### Instructions\n\nRatio: A measure is used to compare values from different observations for a single variable.\n\nFor example, if two animals weigh 14 pounds and 23 pounds, the appropriate ratio is 14/23.

{"text": "A, C, and D.\n\n\n### Demand:Which of the following do you agree on? Choices: 1: I do not think it matters if your work is a creative venture. 2: I think it matters if your creative work is done for pay as opposed to for your own satisfaction. 3: If you are creating a creative piece and you are being paid, you need to have some sort of formal schooling for the project to be considered art. 4: It does not matter whether or not you have a formal education to consider yourself an artist. \n\n### Response Choice:\n\\>Ans 1, 3, 4\n```\n```\n### Instruction Text:\nA: Choose the answer that most accurately completes the request\n```\n```\nDemand 1: I do think it matters that your work is a creativity venture. The reason why it matters, especially within a creative field, is because the mind behind the art is just as important as the work itself. So, for example, if you are doing a creative piece for pay, then the fact that you have a creative mind and know what you are doing is what is going to come across in your art.\nDemand 2: I think if you are creating a creativity piece and you are getting paid for the piece, then the formality of the piece should be acknowledged. A formal education is a key component to creating a solid piece within a given creativity. This is because formal education provides a more complete understanding in regards to art and also helps the artist see things more clearly in regards to what he/she can put into their respective project.\nDemand Choice 3: If you're making a creative work and if you get paid for the work, you need to have at least some sort of formal school and training in the project. This is because schooling is important in creativity as well as other forms of art. Without formal schooling, what a person knows about and understands about their own art is limited.\n\n\n## Question 2:\n\n### Instructive Text:\nThis question will ask you to provide more than one correct answer.

The frog jumps 9 times to cross a boardwalk that is 64 feet long. Therefore, 9 x 24 = 216\n\n### Exceed:The frog took 6 jumps to cross the boardwalk The boardwalk is 64 feet. The jumps are 7 meters.  We do 6 x 7 = 42 The boardwalk is 16 meters. The frog will take 42 jumps to cross.\n\n### Epiphany:Each frog jump is 24 feet. The frog needs to cross a boardwalk length. Divide the length of the boardwalk into the number of jumps and you will get the jumps needed.\n\n### Epitope:The frog is going to take 12 jumps across the boardwalk because each jump is 24 long and the boardwalk 64 feet long and 4 jumps go into 1 meter.\n\n### Revelation:We know the frog leaps 14 feet with one jump, which means that the frog will take 2 jumps to get to the boardwalk.\n\n### Enquiring:We know that the frogs leap 24 (5 x 4) feet per jump, therefore 2 (1/5) x 5 = 1 x 3 = 3  The number of jumps is 3 because the first jump was 24 feet long. The second jump was 48 feet long.\n\n### Interchange:The frog will do 3 jumps to get across the boardwalk because 24(x)/24 = 1 therefore 6 jumps will get across the boardwalk.", "answer": "D: restlessness"}
{"text": "John was feeling bankruptcy after spending the extra money on products for his swolling testicles.\n\n### Input John has a very large cake in his kitchen.  He wants to cut the cake into as many equal pieces as he has people in his family. His cake is 2 foot by 2 foot and his family is three generations.  He has his mother, his father, his mother\u2019s five sisters, his father\u2019s sister, his three sons, his two nephews, his wife, and himself. His oldest nephew and three of his sisters\u2019 kids are very young and they don\u2019t know their real age.  What is the equation for how many pieces of cake will he need to cut?\n\n### Response One piece (0.5 foot X 0.5 foot) for John, one piece (0.5 X 0.5) for his mother, one piece (0..5 X 0.64) for his father\u2019s sister and one 0.5 X 3 for the 7 kids under the age of 3.  So altogether he needs 1 piece (0.5) for the parents, three pieces for the aunts (0.5 X three = 1.5), three pieces for the cousins (0.5 X3 = 1.5) and three pieces for his wife and two sons (0.5 X2 = 1). So a total of 1+3/0.63 +1+3/0.(64) +1+0.53/.35 +1+2X.5=.

In this\nexample, the problem statement indicates how the problem should be solved and how it should be described.\n\nIf the problem statement is incomplete or otherwise unacceptable, it is often helpful\nto define its purpose and scope:\n\n- What is the purpose of this problem statement?\n\n- Is the problem statement focused on a specific part of this problem or on a\nsubset of possible solutions?\n\nThe complete problem statement is then revised as needed to fit the needs of the\nsolution. In this example, the problem statement provided additional information\nabout the specific problem to clarify the situation.\n\n### Outcome\n\nThe problem and how the problem should be described are addressed by\nanswering the statement of the problem. In this question, the problem was to identify\nthe snake in the burlap sack. The steps required to solve this problem are:\n\n1. Consider the problem as a whole\n\n2. Identify the components of the problem\n\n3. Establish the relationship between the problem's components by examining each\nof its parts in detail\n\n4. Consider alternative actions or solutions\n\n5. Make a determination about the best alternative\n\nIf different solutions are not available or are not appropriate for the situation,\nthen the questioner, whether it is someone from the workplace or within a personal\nlife situation, may need to restate the problem. They may also need to reframe the\nquestion in a specific way to allow a more acceptable solution. Often times, the\nproblem is actually the result of poor problem definition techniques and should be\ncorrected before the questioner receives an answer. In this example, it may appear to\nthe problem solver that there is not a snake in the burden. In reality, there may be a\ndifferent problem that is a subset of the original, but more suitable for a\nparticular solution.\n\nAnother example, if someone asks, How do I lose 45 pounds in 3 months?

If the animal transport truck holds and you drive at certain speed per hour then 60 miles/hour means 60/1 hour so you solve that 60 you multiply 60 times 20/8 (20 goes in 8 because 8 is two zeroes and 2 goes in two zeroes when you solve). so 20/2 because 2 goes to first zero and two goes to second zero. So its 20/2= 10 goes in. Because that 10/1 means 10 goes to 1 so your answer is 50/100= \u00bd. It comes out to be 40 hours.\n3.

That $30 divided/2 is $15 so $15 x 2/4= $7.50 Then $7.50 x 4/7 = $3.50 then add $7.50 to $15 to get $22.50 and that is the total of each child\u2019s share.\n4.

{"text": "D\n\n### Instructions:\nYour assignment is to write a program that replicates an input command to the terminal (that might be used at a command prompt) by printing out a new string of text.\n\nYour assignment in this course is to write a program capable of receiving a command string (containing words separated by spaces), and outputting the words in a new string in the new order.\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes how you might go about accomplishing this task.\n\n### Input command:\n\"Hello, my name is Jennifer!\" \n\n### Your task is to complete this task by printing a string with these words in a different order, so that \"Jennifer, my name is Hello\" is the result.\n\n### How You Might Begin:\nWe need to do three things to do this task.  1.  We need to create a variable with the name \"command\".  We must use the variable command since we will be inputting a command string at a later time.  1.  Since this is a task for a command line, we know it will need to deal with word separation, the \"word separator\".  We need to use word separation to remove spaces in the command, and replace them with a separator.  In this case, the separator will be a comma.  This is a relatively simple task that is provided by the \"string\" data type in p5.text.  We need to insert the comma into each string so that the result is a string with words delimited by a comma.  1.  Finally, we need to create a new string, or \"commandString\", that will be the result of the first \"command\".  To do this, we can use the string concatenation operator.\n\nWe must also make certain that our prompting is clear.  We must ensure it includes a prompt command that prompts the user for the command and the word separator so that the variable command contains a correct command String.  Then, print the command string in the new order, where the words are separated by the word separator.\n\n### Output:\nHello, my name is  Jennifer!\n\n----\n\n### Demo:\nInput: What is your name?\nAnswer:  John\n\nInput: What is the word \"cat\" spelled with the first three letters capitalized?\nAnswer:  Cat\n\nInput:", "answer": "D: canada"}

In either case the best solution depends on the context in which the function will be used. Both proposed solutions have their pros and cons.\nFor a long time the current implementation of the function worked well enough. The debate concerns the performance of the function when the load increases. The question is how the debate could be handled?\n\n### Response 2\nI agree with that statement because what matters is what the function does. The current implementation does not meet the requirements, so we have two options when enhancing it. There are two possible approaches, which are either changing the algorithm or moving it to a different location.\nThe first option would be to use an algorithm which takes less time per task. This method is very flexible to our needs at this point. However, we can also improve performance by moving", "answer": "E: eat plants"}

He and his friend visited a few houses together. By the time they were finished, he was more hopeful than when he started out. How long had he looked?\n\nInput: Three hours\n\n### Explanation:\n\n**Task:** The question is for you to choose the sentence that is grammatically correct and has the correct sense according to the given context.\n\n**Input:** He had been looking for\u2026\n\n**Choice A:** B) employment\n\n**Choice B:** D) working hard\n\n**Choice C:** D) working  hard\n\n**Choice D:** D) working   hard\n\n**Choice E:** C) work  hard\n\n**Correct Answer:** Option C\n\nThe sentence:  He had been looking for \u2026 (1) is not grammatically correct.  The comma after \u2018looking\u2019 has made the sentence wrong.\n\nThe sentence: He didn\u2019t founf a house in three weeks (2) has an error of subject and predicate.  The predicate \u2018had been looking for\u2019 refers to the subject \u2018He\u2019, so the predicate has to be matched  with the correct subject.\n\nOption 1 and option 2 have the same error and so they need to be ignored.\n\nThe sentence He was out looking for (3) has the correct subject \u2018He\u2019 and predicate but it is not grammatically correct since \u2018and\u2019 is used to join two parallel sentences.\n\nThe sentence is not correct as the meaning of the sentence is lost when we add the comma before \u2018and\u2019.\n\nOption 3 is thus correct.\n\n**Task: ** The question is to determine if the number of days that an activity takes in a month is less than the number of days of that month itself.If the activity took less days than days of the month then the answer is YES else it will be NO.\n\n**Input** : It takes 12 days to prepare for an", "answer": "B: frustration"}

{"text": "D:create success & produce a reproducible result\n\n# Solution 1\n\n### Instructions:\n\n\nThe answer choices are A-E. A is definitely not correct, as it doesn't even try to answer the question. B seems like it should be correct, as a party sounds\nexciting. However, if a single person were to celebrate the reproductive outcome of\nany sex, it would not be considered a success. And if someone is trying to procreate they are not going to leave after a party, so there is no\nexciting cheering. C does not work, either. If the crowd is trying to cheer for a person\nto start reproducing but that person is just trying to have a social event, they should not have a party. This is not what the\ncrowd is cheering for, so they are not trying to have some kind of success; they are simply trying to have an exciting interaction with their\ncrowd. D, therefore, is also not the correct answer. If a party is not what the crowd\nis trying to have, then the crowd is simply trying to cheer, and if there is one\nsuccessful procreation attempt, why would they start cheering?\n\nThe correct answer then, is choice E. A reproducible success would also be a\nsuccess, and since they are trying to succeed, this would be a crowd that would get\nexcited when there is successful reproduction.\n\n### Student solution 1\n\n## Instructions:\nThe answer choices areA-E. A is not correct as it does not directly answer the question (which is \"What is a success when attempting procreateon?') A, if correct, would also state that celebration isn't what a crowd of people would do when trying to encourage reproduction. Even though cheering may result, it is not their goal to generate cheering. Therefore, answer B is also incorrect (though close in that it would suggest that a party where people are excited is what a crowd is trying to create in order to encourage procreation; however, parties would be celebrated before they were created (if they were created at all)). C isn't correct either in that it is also an attempt to be successful in generating cheering (while celebrating would generate excitement, it would not be what the crowd is trying to achieve in its excitement).

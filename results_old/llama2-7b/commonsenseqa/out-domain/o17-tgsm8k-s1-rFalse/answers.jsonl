The principle has instructed her that in order to teach science, she had to teach her students the letters of the alphabet.  She wanted to make her first lesson a good one, so she created a fun game to teach them the alphabet.  Her game required them to memorize the order of the letters in the alphabet.  At the beginning of her class, she called on students to play her game.  One of the students volunteered to run and came back to the classroom with an umbrella, but on his way back to the classroom, he tripped and dropped the umbrella on the way back.  One row of the classroom was right under him when he fell which made him fall on top of the seats. He made some noise when he fell, resulting in the whole class becoming quiet.  The principle was outside and on his way to a nearby store which made him late at arriving to the classroom.

{"text": "A\n\n### Influence:\nIn a basketball game, when do the players get tired?\n\n### Demand:\nHow hard of work do the players need to do at the end of the game?\n\n### Input\nThis is a tricky question. The answer to what is the hope of doing something is always the same (A), unless there is a restriction. If the restriction is that you can't do it without competition, there is the possibility of doing sports without competition, so you pick B. You give a lot of credence to the fact that you will have to do sports if you want to be good, but you may not be good because you could fail. Then you may be tired, which could also be the case if you don't want to be competitive. However, this is just a small part of the question. In addition, the question does not say that no one will be competitive, and I would guess that the question only means to say that you cannot have games without competition. So, what is the hope for doing sports without competition, and how does one do it?\n\n### Influx:\nThis question does not tell you that you must do sports before competitions, but only mentions that if you make a good effort you will be good in terms of competitions, and then you will be tired because you will be competitive. The competitions are competitive because they are good at competitions.\n\n### Input-output:\nThe answer \"running\" indicates that you will do running. Therefore, the answer \"getting tired\" indicates that you will get tired. If you do sports as a sport for competitive reasons, you may have to compete, and that would be the \"hope of doing sports\". This question does not say that you will get tired, but it does say that you will play sports for competitive reasons. It therefore implies that you will do competitions for competitive reasons.\n\n### Infinite:\nThe answer cannot be E, because there will be many players, not \"one player\" as this question reads.\n\n### Response-Output:\nIf you were to go to a basketball game, you would be on the field because you could be off in a game. If you were playing for the team, you would do the running to get the ball or the shot, and this would be the \"hoop\". If your team won,", "answer": "B: have fun"}

The items are related in a manner which requires only a simple association or operation to put those items in order.\n\nYour job is to correctly match each pair of items based on this simple operation. Some operations will require no operation at all, but match two items according to the nature of the items.\n\nFor example, if we are given two values like \"282\" and \"145,\" there is nothing we can do to these two values in order to put them in increasing order, so the two items will be correctly paired.\n\n### Note\n  If none of the given items can be paired according to this easy criterion, you may leave either, or both, of the items blank.\n\nIn a perfect universe, all tasks are correctly solved without difficulty.

{"text": "Answer:  A: reveilng information\n\n### Input\nYou have a jar with two kinds of money, $1's and $5's.  There are 10 $5 bills, 30 $1 bills, and one $10 bill that you must distribute between two people.  How should you distribute the money so each person gets the same amount of currency?\n\n### Response\nFirst, I should count how many $10 is left after I have used $10 to buy $5 for $1 and $1 to buy $1 for 5. Here's the formula for the whole amount left. (10*5)+(10*(1/5))=120+5=125. After 10 $5 and six 10$1, I have 125. Now I take the 10$5 to buy 6 $10. The whole part is (10*6)+(1*10)-6*10=12+10-60=-34. Now, I have to give out 125-34=91. And, what amount does each person get? I give 125/2=62.50 to each person.\n\n### Input-I don't get what this is about but I guess it is about a company of some kind I am not sure about\nThe company is going public because they want to raise money to solve their problems. So, if company doesn't make good decisions then they will have problems.\n\n### Comment\nI see that you are aware of that a company should have more money. However, for the second example, you might want to give different hints.\n\nNow, what should you do if you can only give to one person with a fixed $2, so that each person can't be happy?\n\nYou should make the amount of money that you give to one person equal to the total amount of money that the two persons can get. Because they both can be satisfied with the same amount of money, they don't need to think about who should have more. Instead of that, they can work together. What is the solution?

Aardvarks have a snout-like mouth, an elongated body, short legs, and long ears and feet. They are primarily nocturnal, feeding on termites, larvae, and other insects.

{"text": "Billy's mother will have left her things on bathroom floor.\n\n### Input\nHow many times do the five members of a group get together each week if two of them meet two times each week and three of them meet three times each week, but not every meeting is with the same person?\n### Response\n\nThere are a total of 55 times if they meet with each other 2 times and 3 times respectively. Excluding the ones that are the same the total should come up to 55. But you don't do it in that way it will become messy so what I did was just add up all the ways that they get together and see if it adds up to 55 then it will be true but the thing is that the number will be bigger than 55. So what we have to do is divide the total by 2 which is 27 the rest of the options are also like that.\n\n### Response to the response:\nYou're right to point out that the answer is not 55 - the answer is 27. But how can we explain such result?\n\n> A possible explanation could be:\n> For five members the total number of times they have met is 5 x 2 + 5 x 3 = 55. Now we could divide it by two to get 55/2, but not all ways could be done in two to divide it.\n\nSo since we can\u2019t divide by two, we could divide it by another one to divide it by two i.e. we can take 55/3 and get the answer as 2 x 2 = 27. I think this explanation isn\u2019t the best one but would be helpful for anyone who is struggling with this topic.\n\n### Description:\nInput a positive integer, n, the number of times Billy's group meets.\n\nInput n times the group met in the form of two values (x1, x2, x3, x4 and x5) representing to the n members of the group the times that the n members meet each other in total order.\n\n### Output:\nOutput the remainder when the sum of of the times that the members of Billy's group meet each other is divided by 2.\n\nExample: [2, 3, 2, 1, 1] ->", "answer": "B: hall"}

In order to make those monthly payments John must earn at least $45 a week. The tablets, with identical features, vary in price between $82 and $98. John wants to find the tablet that will last him 3.25 years at the lowest possible cost. To do this, John needs to determine what tablet is _cheapest_ within each price range. Which tablet is _cheaper_? Answer: the least expensive product. If you think this is incorrect, then you are mistaken. There are only two tablet possibilities. One must be more expensive than the other. We would expect $50 to be less than $60, but $60 or $70 could be more than $50. But one tablet is more than $50 dollars, and one is less than $50 dollars. The $50 one is the cheaper one. The cheapest product within the $82\u201498 range is the $82 one. The cheapest possible tablet is the $82 tablet.)\n\n### Answer:If you think this is incorrect then you are mistaken.\n\n### Output:John wants to buy a 20-inch flat screen TV.  His friend Mike knows that John must earn at \nleast $21.50 a week to buy the TV. He knows this because the cheapest TV that John will accept is priced at $269.  The TV costs 14 cents more for every dollar that John has available to spend on it.  Mike told him this when they met for coffee a week ago.<br><br> The amount that John has available for the TV decreases if he has to use any money to eat or pay for housing.<br><br> John told Mike that $269 is way more TV than he needs.<br><br> So, what should he spend on the TV?\n\n### Output:(a)The TV is _cheaper_ than the total amount John will need to buy that.

She drives to the gas station and gets 1/10 more gallons of gas than her tank can hold. How much gas does Mary put in her tank?\nAnswer: 0\n\n### Response\n\nA: That's impossible.

How far did he travel between 10:05 and 10:07?\n\n\n### Response \n\nE: The answer is zero.\n\nFirstly, the man was walking to his destination at 5 10 minute intervals. So, in each of these intervals, the man is now half of the way to his destination.\n\nIn the interval between the man getting to 100 meters from his destination, and when the next half the man got there, the man didn't get to his destination.\nThis result means that in the next interval that the man walked with, he got to 101 meters in the interval between 10 minutes after 10:09.\n\nContrary to the assumptions made in the question, half of the way is the wrong way to find the distance. In the case for this question, we can find the distance that the man walked in the past 2 hours, if we calculated between the times at which the man is more than 10 minutes after each half.\n\nAnother possible solution would be to subtract the total distances that the man walked in these intervals.\n\n**So, if there were 3 hours in between when the man would end the intervals that he completed, then when the man completed his task and ended the intervals, he would have been 3 units short and so the question is wrong**\n\n### Instruct", "answer": "B: countryside"}

You have to be explicit in your answer. You can not get away with an implicit, hidden answer. As written and as answered, it is a good solution.\n\n### Hints\n\nIf you were to help a friend write an EoC, I think the following hints should work really well for it. Feel free to steal them, I just want you to succeed.\n\nThere is really no structure or organization to this question. Its sort of like a bunch of individual questions, none of which are particularly difficult, but none of which are necessarily trivial, either. However, for the questions that follow, I think you can write a list of hints. But for the one question of the 500 that are in the test, I think you can probably write a pretty long (and still effective?) hint. Here is an example.\n\nIn each question, try to think about how you would do one part of the problem, and then try to think about how to use that in the other parts of the problem. Try to make at least 2 or 3 connections between the things you learned and the EoCs.\n\nI would focus on trying to get the answer \"correct\". Of course, that's always important, but if you can use that as a starting point for building a EoC, you should take that opportunity.\n\n### Additional Feedback\n\nTo get at your solution, we need to know what you did.

{"text": "C) This is because, on occasion, a famous banjo player is known to play in a jug band. However, we could not help but notice that the banjo has a deep connection within history of the United States where it was invented. It has also been a favorite instrument for many American musicians across time period from jazz to bluegrass.  The banjo has influenced many other types of music, like country and hip-hop, all of which can be found in America but not the Caribbean.\n\n### Solution:If the banjo has a history in the Caribbeans, this means that it has a history elsewhere that is closer to present day America than the Caribbean. In America, jug bands and bluegrass is present. Both have the banjo and are more popular than in other countries where it was invented first. Jazz and hip-hop were both invented in the US as well but they do not have the banjo on their instrumentation. The answer is found in D because it answers the question.  A, B, and E do not answer the question.

You must pass each game, with a score less than 61. Is it possible to get less than 61 points on the first game, but get more than 61 points in total? Choices: \n\n### Response\nA: Yes, you only need to score 60 points on the first game.\n\n### Response B\nYes, if you add the points totals to both games, if you\u2019d get 61 points the first time but below it on the first round, it would show 61 points.  \n\n### Solution :The choice, if true, means that passing the test is possible to only get below 61 points on one game.  So if it was possible to get 60 on the first game, we could also do more games.  However, this choice says we have to get 61 in total so we have to do 5 games rather than just 1 game. So the answer is false and we know we cannot achieve this.\n###", "answer": "D: united states"}

She uses 3 large stickers per page of her journal.  How many stickers are remaining to use?\n\nFirst, we will decide how many pages to use for all the problems.  We multiply 87 (the original number of stickers) to 3 to get 261 (the number of pages).\n\nThen, we will determine the amount of stickers on each page. In the first problem, she uses large stickers on 3 pages only. The rest of the pages have 7 stickers each. We multiply 7 to 261 (261\u00d77=1737). Now the amount of stickers left is equal to 87 - 1737 = -1650.\n\nAnd we finally subtract -1650 (the amount of stickers left) from 261 (amount of pages) to get 86 stickers remaining (261 - 1650 = 86).", "answer": "C: thinking"}

I don't know how old Franz is, but he couldn't be any older than me. I guess I'm thirteen because he looks like he's a year or two younger than the other boys. He even smells younger, like he's never done laundry before, he never even thought about doing laundry. It's a smell that makes me think of old cement or maybe damp straw.\n\nSome kids in my class don't like Franz. They call him names and throw things at him. I know he's never done anything to these kids. They treat Franz like he's some kind of animal, or a piece of furniture, or a bug, or something they'll never think about again. I want to scream at them to just stop it. I want to scold them and tell them how unkind it is to make fun of someone who just needs friends.\n\nBut what good am I? Franz is my only friend, and I guess I already get in enough trouble for not doing what I'm supposed to. So these are the sorts of thoughts that I have, all day long, every day, whenever I'm not busy. Sometimes a kind person will say something to me; Mr. Krauss, my teacher, Mrs. Spengler, our cook, my mother, my father, a few select friends, some of the other kids. They're just trying to make it better, with all these sweet words. But I'm just standing there like the dumb thing, which is what I feel like. Then they look into my dark eyes, and if they want to see anything, they'll see a black shadow, and then they'll move away from me, or maybe they'll move toward me. Either way, their kindness goes wasted, because that's what I am. I'm the empty one.

How much did we have rain fall this week?\n\nChoice: 2 in\n\n### Output\nInput:  The amount of water an irrigation pipe needs per second depends on the amount of water in the pipe.  We can find the amount of water in a pipe by subtracting the inward force, or pressure, on the pipe from the outward force, or suction.  Suction is calculated by the width of the pipe.  If the width of the pipe is known, the suction is simply half of the width.  The outward force on a pipe equals its weight, so we subtract the pressure on the irrigation pipe by the weight.  But what if the pipe is 10 feet long and is weighed down by another 10 feet of piping?  Suppose we added another 10 feet more to the same 10 foot pipe we already have.

The man was thinking that it wouldn't be long before he'd need to choose another dishwasher, so he decided to get the one that'd last the longest.  The man went to the appliance store and got a new dishwaher.  He decided that he'd rather not throw away 50% of the cost of the old dishwasher (since he got a 50% discount on the new one) and so he spent it on more cable.

C and D look very similar<n><n>### Response 2<n>There are many different ways the input can be answered. One way is to list each answer option, and then write a code for each way to respond to that answer. This would have worked perfectly if the answer was an image, but since it wasn’t an image, there were only two unique answers. Since it only needed one of two unique answers, the if statement could be used with just two answers to input, and then use else in the response block if those two answers weren’t correct.<n><n>The code would look like this:<n><n>```if ( answer == "D" ) { response =  "Jamie went on an exercise program." }<n><n>```<n>The only thing I changed was the if statement instead of having a question mark (which would match the word “answer”), I matched the value from the input “D.” The else block is used in case the the responded answer isn’t one of the possible choices, so I used an else block in the response block but since there are only two possible answers, I should have known that if, in all cases, they were to respond, their response would be correct.<n><n>### Response to 1 and other responses<n><n>This task requires creative ways to solve it because there will be many possibilities of how one might respond.

At least 3 students have the same books<n><n>### Instrections:Answer the following short answer questions.<n>### Input statement:<n>1. On my way back from the store I had 10 loaves of bread.  I had eight bags. I packed each bag with as many loaves of bread as would fit. I put my milk in the cart before I started putting things in the bags. Once the milk was in there, the bags were not exactly full, but they weighed 30 lbs each. I put the bags on the seat of this old truck, drove to the other end of town, and loaded it into my U-Haul, and put all of the bags in. <n><n>## Response<n>1. You packed only half a loaf of bread in each bag, which made them only weigh 15 lbs each (not 30 lbs), because you could fit 10 loaves per bag, not 11 per bag. <n>### Demostration<n>1. On my trip back from the store I put 10 loaves in each bag, for 15 bags per load. I had 8 bags so I loaded my load. I loaded 120 loaves of bread into each load, then I went to the other side of town and used my u-haul to carry my load over and then I went on my way home with three extra loaves of bread which I couldn't carry in my truck.<n>### Instrucion:<n>answer the short answer question that has been asked<n><n>###

Where might he avoid going? Choices:  A: pet store B: parking lot C: woodland D: north america E: park<n><n>### Response:		<n>John should likely avoid parking lots, as it is widely suspected to be a major source of animal abuse, as most people assume that no one will look at them in a parking lot.<n><n>Additionally, he should probably avoid pet shops, as many animals in the store are taken directly out of their habitat and are not allowed proper care, causing unnecessary suffering as a result. This has led to many pet stores being banned throughout the country and internationally.<n><n>However, he should not limit himself to a single location, as they would be an exception rather than a rule.<n><n>### Input <n>- Two hundred eighteen. <n>- Two hundred twenty two. <n>- Six hundred eighty five.<n>- Two hundred four. <n>- One thousand five hundred eleven.<n>- 4500, 4250, and 3770.<n><n>### Response<n><n>The most correct answer is 5340, because of the following:<n>2018 can be rearranged to two hundred and eight two one. From this, two hundred twenty two follows, one hundred twenty nine is derived from nine zero one, and similarly, sixty eight five can be derived from twenty eight two nine.<n>685 is 1/0 from 686, so 8211 = 4500<n>4250 + 3770 = 8020.<n>

There are 4 times as many percussion players as there are woodwind, and twice as many woodwinds as brass.  How many brass players are there?<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:What does god want people to do for money? Choices:  A: work in life B: speak to people C: everywhere D: sitting ideal E: care for people<n><n>### Response:		<n>If everyone just worked it out, everyone would have everything they wanted. Not everything is about money, it is about the love the people have within them to make their fellow man happy.<n><n>### Input/Response<n>Everyone has a problem with money, because most of them do not know how it actually works in the world. Because of this, they can get into a world of debt, because they do not understand how much they need to save, and how to make their money from one thing. Most people that work at businesses, or have their business in a shop do not understand where the money that the company needs to pay for the debts. If everyone understood how money actually worked, they would not have debts, and would not have to stress about them being in their minds. People should just work, and do the best they can to find work that can earn their income, to pay of their debts.<n><n>### Problem<n>Some people might work hard every day, but do they really make the most of everything, and learn everything about their job? Many people just work for their money and go home, without any care, or understanding on what they are really doing when they are working. They just do it for the money, and leave everything else. Other people may work the same for their money, but they also learn the ways of the job, and make use of everything that they can. It is not just about having money, it is knowing how the money actually earned, and knowing the ways that you can use it.<n><n>### Question<n>Everything can go up and down, because there can be many problems that people might be dealing with. People should know that if money is not their problem, but a problem with their family, then they should find ways to get over it, and they should deal with it. If they cannot fix the problem, and find new ways of getting money, they should get help from their community. Many people who are not aware of how to do their own work, and are unaware of the different ways that they can work, they should get some help from their friends, or their community. They could also get help from a non-profit organization, or government, to find where they can get money. If they cannot get help, then they could find themselves in an even bigger mess, and they could lose everything they have.<n><n>### Example<n>Many people do the same things for their job, and

Choices:  A: cash drawer B: piggy bank C: purse D: box E: pocket<n><n>### Response:		How do you know the question?<n><n>### Demistakes:<n>* 2. One should note that the numbers in the first question are 2x the numbers in the second question. The number of dogs is not a problem in the second question.<n>* 1. the numbers should be the same in the two questions.<n><n>### Solution:<n>The questions in the two tasks are related by the number of steps that can pass in each.  For the first task the answer is 5x.  For the second task the answer is 25x.<n><n>For the first task there are 3x.  For the last two tasks there is only 1x.<n><n>The difference in answers can be explained by understanding that there are five times as many in the first case and four times.  This is because there is more space to choose from.  In the case where there is a different number of selections to be made, it is possible to make one or the fewer selections available but impossible to make 5 or 25 selections available as in the first task.<n><n>### What it teaches us about programming:<n><n>*  It helps us to understand the difference between a linear sequence and a loop.<n>*  It teaches us about creating loops.  The number of times a loop is set to a different value is usually the same that as the number of "steps" that can pass.<n>*  It makes it clear that it is easy to break rules by misunderstanding the "steps" required.<n><n>

Your mission is to find and get to the closest safe zone so that you can rebuild civilization and prevent yourself from becoming one of the walking dead. To ensure your safety, all safe zones have a security patrol that will immediately execute you if they suspect you are not a human survivor.<n><n>### Examples:<n><n>### Example 1:<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>### Explanation:<n>For this problem, I used a while loop to iterate my algorithm and count the number of zombies I bump into. When I have encountered 'n' zombies, I will attempt to reach the safe zone. I will use a recursion with the inputted number of zombies as the base case and my total distance remaining as the recursion case, so that I can get to the safe zone.<n>### Example 2:<n><n>### Demeostration:<n>Notebook Link: <https://github.com/dylang-/Intermediate_ML/blob/master/Week%2010/Zombies.nb><n><n>### Explation:<n>I decided to create my own method, since the default 'for' loop did not allow me to calculate the value of 'n' and the value of my remaining distance to the safe zone. My method also has a recursion with my recursion base being 'zombie_number', and my recursion case being the total remaining distance to the safe-zone. <n><n>### Instuction:Using the algorithm you used to solve "Zombies" above, write code to find the distance

If it was a 24 hr time when at midnight, it will be more probable to chose 7:00:00. If it was an am time when the 7's came first, it should be able to pass for 7:30.  We then split it up from the two sides to find the different values for the 20.<n><n>One side will be all zero's, we can add two from the zero's. 1<n><n>Another side where there is one two, one four, and one eight, we can add 12 from the eight's. 12<n><n>Another side that has two sixes, we can add 7 from the one two. If the two sixes were not there, it should have been 6 + 2 from the zero's or 8 from the four. Then for that side's total we can add 7.<n><n>So that now has the three values of 20 where they are divisible by 2 that will go into the 7's range where the 5 was subtracted making 8, then we just have to compare with those values to check if it's actually divisible by 2. 18 is not divisible for 2 making the solution wrong.<n><n>### Output:Based on the information in the above paragraph, what is the output?<n>Answer: 2 times 15

Choices:  A: factory B: school C: grocery store D: band E: aircraft<n><n>### Response:		<n>A<n><n>### Justification:<n>The correct answer is A. Aircraft are man made; thus, they are technological in their own right; not a place to manufacture. The manufacturing that takes place in the choice “school” could take place in “factory,” and perhaps in a “factory,” but not necessarily, there is a difference. The choice “grocer’s store” sells manufactured food and is not where manufacturing operations take place. Finally, the choice “band” cannot be a “factory,” a “school,” or a “grocer’s stroll”, or an “aircraft,” so only one choice remains, and it is correct.

What is the difference between the two groups of women? <n>2. Is it true that the women who ate fast food had more weight gain than the women who ate fresh? <n>3. What would result in the greatest weight gain if all four hypotheses were true? <n>4. What would result in no weight gain if all four hypothesis were true?<n><n>5. The first hypothesis is not true because the women who ate the fast food gained 3 pounds more body fat than the women who aired them. The second hypothesis is false and the third hypothesis is false because the women aired women lost body weight more than the women who airt and that the women aired them lost the most body fat. The fourth hypothesis is not true because they lost more fat when they aired them compared to when they aired them. <n><n>### Instructor Instructions <n>1. Demonstration - ask a question and provide feedback to the student.<n><n>### Answer:<n>1. The women who ate fresh food lost more body weight in comparison to the women who ate processed food. <n><n>2. Eating fast food will result in more weight gain because it requires more calories to process the food. When the body is processing the food that it is receiving, it uses up more calories than if it just ate the unprocessed food.<n><n>3. Women who ate fast food would gain the most if all hypotheses were true. If the hypothesis is true and none of the women ate either fast food or fresh food, they would have the most weight gain. Eating that way would result in the least weight gain because there is less difference in calorie intake during that period.<n><n>4. If all hypotheses are true then there would be no difference in weight gain. This can be true because when the women who ate both lose the same amount of weight as they lose then they would equal out. When you calculate the weight loss for both women then you would realize that every hypothesis is false and they both lost the same amount of weight.<n>

For example, if the set was 1, 5, 8, 11, 18, and 23, 5 would be the median value. The set would be parted equally: one part from the value of 8 and the other part from the value of11. The average is found by using these methods using a formula. You could use the mean or average to find the mode, and then you could use the mode to determine the arithmetic or geometric mean.<n><n>In statistics, mean is used in arithmetic and geometric mean. To find the mean of a set of numbers, you can add and divide.

Choices:  A: relaxation B: exhaustion C: energetic D: become stronger E: use energy<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>In my opinion, exercising helps the body, both physically and mentally, to function at its maximum potential and therefore leads straight to relaxation.  My exercise regime consists of a two-hour swimming session 4 times a week. I usually follow this routine of exercise with a yoga session.<n><n>The workout allows me to gain the healthy sweat that I need to increase my endurance level and gain the strength I need. Furthermore, because of it, I feel more relaxed and healthy.<n><n>I am certain that I would never want to do exercise if it did not make me relaxed. It helps me to be energized for the next day.<n><n>### Input<n>What should a good diet include?

I would never just choose one type of food, because there are different nutrients included from different types of foods.<n>The foods that I eat are a variety to balance the foods I need.  I need to eat foods that are high in protein to help me maintain my energy. It also helps me to stay healthy. I get my fiber from broccoli, and I get my calcium and Vitamin A from milk products and fish. My protein comes from yogurt. By making these choices, I ensure that I am getting the best health possible from my diet.

Choices:  A: lake B: manhattan C: shoreline D: coastal area E: los angeles<n><n>### Response:		 A<n><n>### Demostration:<n>There are a few different parts to this question. First, the question asked the location a bay is always found. The answer would be a lake, because they aren’t usually found on any other body of water.<n><n>### Input question:The sum of two consecutive integers is 115.If 111 is subtracted from the first integer, it yields _____, which is the smaller of the two integers?<n>Choices: A: 115 B: 121 C: 126 D: 131 E: 136<n><n>### Demonication:<n>First, I did this problem on paper, to visualize exactly how to do it. I knew that the answer choices were 126 and 131, so I did the problem.<n>115+111=226, 2+226=228. 228-115 (the smaller integer)=113. 113-111=2, so 111 is not the smaller integer. 131 is the smaller integer.<n><n>### Demo: Write a conditional expression that checks if the user-entered integer has the same remainder as 28 when divided by 4. To get into the right mindset, perform the following mental math.<n>If user-entered integer = 28, then: user-entered integer %% 4 = 0, user-entered integer % 28 = 12.<n>If user-enerd integer = 30, then: user-eneterd integer %% 4 =14, user-entered integer % 30 = 4.  If 4 < 11, then if user-entered integer is 30, then a conditional expression should be returned that says so. If 11 < 4 (if 11 > 4, then the conditional should be false), then no conditional expression should be returned.<n><n>### D: 30 does the remainder operation and gets 12, which is not 11, so the statement doesn’t return. While doing the problem I was also checking to see if the remainder was less than 11 and then the remainder was greater than or equal to

Choices:  A: tenacity B: hands C: coaster D: skill E: breaking<n><n>### Response:		<n>If the man set the cup on a table it must mean that there is no what to balance it, if in this question a what is not needed, it stands to reason that whatever he needed to balance the cup he didn't have.<n><n>### Input<n>The man set the cup.  He lacked what to balance.   It didn't matter: he was a juggler.   Choices: A: tenacity B C: skill D: coaster E: breaking<n><n>It is possible to solve this question by considering which the subject is and what it does.  It took me very little time to see that the subject of sentence 3 is the same as the subject of sentence 1, both being "the man", and the verb tense (present continuous) shows that sentence 1 is in continuous time.  The present tense is also a clue, as the man is juggling.  But there could be more than one man, so we want to know which man.  And we need to know what juggling consists of.  Juggling is a skill, and the verb tense in sentence 2 shows that juggling is not continuous, but rather a single activity that the man is engaged in.  Therefore, the man in sentence 2 must be a performer, not the man in sentence 1, and there are three clues that rule out A since all three clues point to juggling skills being required "to balance" and not the tenacity of the juggler.  We now know the man has no what to balance.  We want to know what he lacks, and we notice that in sentence 1 the man does not have the "whatever he needed to balance the... cup".  There is no what in that sentence, and it would be silly to balance the cup with empty air, so what he lacks must be something that he needs to balance the cup.  The only what that seems relevant to the cup, is in the sentence after the one requiring juggling skills.  "It didn't matter", could be referring to a lack of what to balance the cup since it didn't matter how the cup was balanced.  So the man has no skill to balance the cup.<n><n>But what did the man lack that didn't matter?  If the man lacks something that doesn't matter to him, then he has what he la

If the number of Doberman puppies is 20, how many Schnauzers are there?<n>Answer: 55<n><n>Input: Dr. Banks had 330 toothbrushes to give away to his patients. He gave away 53 toothbrushes in January.

How many fish remain?<n>Answer: 9<n><n>Input: Every hour past noon shadows from a building stretch an extra 5 feet, starting at zero at noon.  How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?<n>Answer: 360<n><n>Input: The marching band has 110 members.  There are 4 times as many percussion players as there are woodwind, and twice as many woodwinds as brass.  How many brass players are there?<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:James felt himself losing consciousness.  He was frightened.  He didn't want this.  He was scared of what? Choices:  A: death B: coma C: peace D: forgetfulness E: loss of life<n><n>### Response:		E<n><n>### Instructions for answer the below multiple choice questions:<n>In the first problem, you can add four to each side to make the left side positive and the right side negative, and use (5, 4, 3) as the solution.<n><n>In the second problem, notice that the number of Dobermans is decreased by 55 every month.<n><n>Notice how the difference between the number you gave away last month and the remainder is constant. So if you gave away 123 toothbrushess last month, then in March you'll give away half of the difference, or 61. Then in April, since you gave away 61 in March, you give away half the remainder, or 31 toothbrushes this month. In May, since you gave away half of the remainder in April, you give away half of that, or 15 toothbrushes every month. Then in May you give away your last toothbrushes so the busiest month lasts for a year while the slowest month goes from March to April. Therefore, you would give away 61, 31, 15 and so forth for a year.<n><n>In the third problem, Sally picks 10 seashells on day one, and then picks 3 seashells on each day following. If 330 total were available, how many are left?<n><n>In the fourth problem, each half of the 30 fish is left, so Jordan has 20 and Perry has 20. If we subtract the amount of fish taken from Sally (10), we have 72 fish (20 + 20 + 30). The shadows measure 3m(1) + 3m(t-1), since every hour the shadows have measured 2m(t) + 2m(t-1). In order to calculate the length of the shadows at 6 (6x), you would need an expression that has these terms:<n><n>3m(1)<n><n>0.5m(6-1)<n><n>0(6)<n><n>4m(6-1).<n><n>Therefore, you'd end up with:<n><n>4(3m(1)+0.5m(5)+3m(5)+0)(6

Describe the benefit of each of your solutions<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>Write a response for the given problem.<n><n>### Problem:<n><n>You are on a sinking lifeboat. It takes 1/3 of your weight to keep you afloat. If you have 200 kg left and need to make it to shore, design a way to safely transport 5000 kg of sand to the shore without putting yourself into a greater danger.<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>The first method is to throw sand in the air, catch it in a large empty container, and slowly push it as far as humanly possible. However, this method is quite dangerous and will not transport the 5000kg in one trip.<n><n>I can only move at 50% capacity without overloading. 5000/(1/3) = 16,666kg. I will have to make many trips to shore with this method.<n><n>Next, we can utilize the force of gravity to move sand. I must move to the shore first, then move the full 5000 back. Gravity will do the majority of the work. However, I will still need to push for a short distance to complete the task. I can only move at 1/3 capacity without overloading as well. 5001/3 = 16, 667kg.<n><n>A third option is that I have two people on the lifeboat and can split the load. If we split the load by 2, than we can make it without any issues.<n><n>I can then move the sand to the shoreline as needed.<n><n>Therefore, we can conclude that the sand method is the safest to perform without risk of drowning, but also without causing injury.<n><n>There are further methods that can be

On the hour, each banana halves its speed.) The first banana reaches its destination in 23 minutes. What does all this mean?<n>Answer: It was either 212, 42, or 21, bananas.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>When bananas are doubled their speed, they will travel double the distance. Thus the 23rd banana must have traveled 46 times the original distance in the first hour.<n><n>Then, when they are halved their speed they should have traveled 1/14 times the original distance in an hour. This means that the 21st of the bananas was at its location for 14/2= 7 hours.<n><n>The answer must be either 212 bananas if they started at 0 and they increased at a constant rate.

In your response, make sure you identify the source that you are quoting.<n><n>### Research:<n>In August, 2009, 16 children were treated for lead poisoning. One school district in Illinois closed all of its water fountains due to lead contamination.  What was the rate of lead poisoning in the school district?<n><n>### Response<n>The children were treated for the lead poisoning so that would indicate that the children were exposed at some point.<n><n>To find if the water fountains in the school district were contributing to the lead poisoning of the children in the school district there are multiple methods and tools. First there could be interviews with the school board and a survey could be conducted to determine if the school fountains were contributing to the high levels of lead poisoning among this group.<n><n>There are also other options for determining if the school district fountains were the source of the lead poisoning. Using chemical tests such as lead testing kits or chemical analysis of water samples could be used to determine if there in high amounts of lead in the water from the school fountains.<n><n>##### Answers:<n>1. The method that a primary researcher used to collect information related to water fountains contributing to lead poison in children is interviews.<n>    1.

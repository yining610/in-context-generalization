If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change?

Choices: A: being a good daughter  B: acting like an adult  C: acting tough  D: being sensible  E: standing her ground<n><n>### Response:::D<n><n>### Rationle:Because “standing her ground” is the only choice that mentions taking a stand or something that Courtney can do while scared.<n><n>### Question: How do you know when a square root is negative?<n><n>### Answer:When you multiply or divide the number by itself.<n><n>### Example:12\^{*}\frac{3}{2}=\frac{12^{3/2}}{2}<n><n>### Answer<n><n>```<n>Answer: 9. The negative sign means that the division will go in the opposite direction. It will subtract the square root from that number instead of add it. I know you said when you multiply, but it also subtracts. Here, 12*\^{*}3/2 = 7.25. When you divide, -12*\^{*}/2 = -6.5.<n>```<n><n>### Comments {<n><n>### My response: 9<n><n>### 12*\^{*}\frac{4}{2}=\frac{3}{4}<n><n>### My answer:3/4

Because bald eagles are generally larger than most birds (except other birds of prey), they are safe from their own species.  If eagles are in a wildlife sanctuary and other birds are excluded, they will then be safe from the birds there.  If wildlife sanctuaries have wild predators, they can be a concern.  It may be safer for them to be on the ground in trees, because that is where they lay their eggs.  There is also risk if they fly out of range and are then injured.<n><n>### Note:<n>You only have to make one response.  This will be the best fitting response.<n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:If you tell you boss your suffering from boredom they'll likely tell you to get back to what?

Since your spinal cord controls you body movements, damage to your spinal cord could result in a lack of coordination or loss of movement on a part of your body.<n>You can find a good example of this is the movie 'Black Swan'.

In the early 2000s Christopher Snyder was working in the New York City as a stand-up comedian. One day he was practicing at his office and his boss asked him to make "funny noises," so that he could improve his comedic timing. While he was moving across the room to make the noises, Christopher slipped on something he couldn't see. This caused him to fall headfirst on a cement floor and land on the floor in an awkward way.<n>The result of this accident was a fracture in Christopher's spinal cord; he had compression fractures in his seventh and eighth thoracic vertebrae and compression fractures in the second, third, and fourth lumbar vertebrae. <n><n>After seeing many doctors Christopher was diagnosed by Dr. Alan Dang, ​​a spinal cord injury specialist, who said that Christopher had a "T-10 incomplete spinal cord injury" that happened due to a "traumatic compression fracture" of his cervical spine. <n><n>A year later Christopher went from being paralyzed to walking with the help of braces and a cane.<n>[https://youtu.be/mY5mR-KzgJA](https://youtu/mY5mKzgJA)<n>

Use a propane torch to add kindling to the pile and let it burn  C. Collect fire wood  D. Light a fire using twigs, leaves, paper and/or sticks  E. Blow on a match to start a fire with dry kindling<n>### Response : I think that the best answer is E.<n><n>### Reason for answer: The options given are (A) Lay a fire for twenty minutes with dry kindling, no wind and (B) put kindling, leaves and stick in a pile using propane torch to start the fire. So by these option I found out that both option use kindling and propane torch for starting fire. I do not think that option (A) can work as it cannot take the fire for 20 min with no wind because fire needs some kind of wind to spread the fire. And when wind blows from side the fire cannot spread. And if you use propane torch to ignite dry kindling then it will spread automatically. If we take option (D), it will only light fire with twigs or sticks because by options the twig is not in there but stick. To know that option (D) is correct we need some experiment to prove that twig or stick can keep fire for long time. By the option C, we need fire wood. It can also be the option of E but only by use propane torch.<n><n>### Output :<n><n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20. If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Eating breakfast in bed can make you feel what, assuming that you don't spill anything?

When my daughter goes back to school I have to pay my cell phone bill. When I get there, there is still a balance of $20 left on my bill.  How much does my cell phone cost?<n>Rational: I made $75 so my new bill will be $75 - $20 = <<75-20=55>>55<n>I spend $55 every two bills, so $55/2 = <<55/2=27.5>>27.5 per two bills<n>The cell phone costs 27.5 x 2 = $<<27.5*2=55>>5.5<n>#### 55<n>Answer: 55<n><n>### Input :<n>Input: Your friend tells you that he has saved up $X. It is enough money for him and his sister to start their own business. After some thinking he tells you that he already has twice as much and saves 10% of it every year so his money will double in 4 years. The sister tells you that she will have $500 in 3 years.  How much money does your friend need to start the business? How much will your friend have in 5 years?<n>Rational: First, I will tell how much the sister needs to have in 3 years. The sister tells me that she wants $500 in three years. Three years from now, she is still $500 short. So (3 years from now) - 3 = <<(3 years from now)-3=0>>0, then that means she still needs $500. So by solving that equation I get: $500 = $<<500>>5000<n>So the sister needs  $\frac {500}{5000} = <<\frac{500}{5,000}=0.1]]0.1 = 10%<n><n>Then I will tell how much money her brother needs to start the business. We know that it is enough to start the business and it doubles every year so $ <<...>>X = $ <<...>>X + X = $ <<...>>1 + X = $ <<\left(\frac{X}{\left(\frac{X}{2

How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20. If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Whether it's popped, grilled, or canned people like to what?

How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

All of the students had agreed that they would take out half of their original funding and pay for the remainder with their own spending money. How much each student needs to spend out of their own money is:<n><n>Rationales: The project funding had been reduced by two hours, so 2 hours = <<2 hours=1/2>>1/2 of the hours spent<n>This means that each student had to spend 1/2 (of the original funding) * 1/2 (after accounting for the reduction) = <<1/2 * 1/2=1>>1 of their original funding on the project.<n>#### 1<n>Answer: 1<n><n>### Input<n>Input: Each student in a math study group has a different favorite food. The students take turns bringing food to study group meetings. If each meeting lasts for three hours, and students bring two different types of food two hours apart, then how many different types of food can be brought?<n>Rationales<n>The students eat two different types of food every three hours, so it repeats:  (2/3)(2/3)(2) = 1.33, or 33%.<n>So there can be 33/3 = <<33/3=11>>11 different types of food.<n>#### 11<n>Answer: 33/3<n><n><n>### Input <n>Input: A father and his children go to a baseball game on Friday night.

The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Why would you not want to be working with wood? Choices:  A: blisters B: frustration C: being paid D: make money E: money<n><n>### Response:		The correct option is "D: make money" or "E: money".<n><n>### Rationale: A blister is an injury that occurs as the result of too much friction on a skin surface. So to answer our question we need to think about the answer that contains a word that describes being paid. The answer that contains the word ‘frustration’ which is one of the responses does not contain this word. This means that our correct option is ‘D: make money’ or ‘E: money’ which are both included in this response because our answer is to be "the word that describes being paid."<n><n>### Note: The correct answer is  “make money” or “money” the word “money” is included because the answer is “the word that describes being payed”<n><n>### Input A:  My car is not working so I will have to call a mechanic to look at it.<n><n>### Response A: I will have to call ______________ <n><n>### Rationales: Because it must have an infinitive, and an infinitive is used when something is going to happen, it ends in TO and the following is going to happen after it: "I call the mechanic”, this response is “I will have to call a memechanic” <n><n>### Input B:  I can’t go to the bar with just $5!<n><n>### Response B: I will have to ______<n><n>### RATIONALES: The following two sentences are both describing a situation where the speaker must do something with just $5:<n>“I can’t go to a bar with just $5.”<n>“I will never be able to go to a bar with $5.” <n><n>### Note that this answer is one of the answers because the answer is the word that describes 'how much they need to be in order to go to the bar' The following sentence is describing a situation where the money is less than or equal to $5.<n><n>### Input C:  I can’ t go to the bar because I don’t have ______ <n><n><n>### Raisons: The same rules apply to all of the above answers.<n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:The wheel was loose, and threatened to fall off when they were what? Choices:  A: footloose B: sailing C: fast D: tighten E: bind<n><n>### Response:		Tighten<n><n>### Justification:I got the response by using the first sentence of the question "the wheel was loose, and "<n>and by looking at the options and putting the words together, I could only combine option A and D because they both start with foot(foothole) and end with something else. So my answer should also be a combination of the other 4 words and the other 4 words are: loosing, sailing, and fast.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Parents often yell in times of chaos, what are they trying to do? Choices:  A: guide children B: understand children C: control children D: care for children E: vent anger<n><n>### Response:		I would go with D care for children in this case. The letter A would make it into some sort of teaching session, which doesn't really fit well here. The letter C kind of makes sense, but it's just talking about being able to control them.<n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:What do only some types of police do?

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

What is the largest of the two numbers?<n>Rational: When we subtract the middle number from the larger, we get -17 which is 17 - (8+9). So -17 = the larger of the two odd numbers. But then we subtract the difference from the larger number and get (17 - (8 + 9) - (8 + 8)) = 9 from subtracting the difference from the larger and the larger from the difference. So 9 = the smaller of the two odd numbers now we can solve for the larger.<n>#### 22<n>Answer: 9<n><n>### Input:: Mr. Walker has 20 apples. Of those 20, 7 of them are red apples. Write an expression that describes how many of each type of apple Mr. Walker has.<n><n>### Response:: 7 is a subset of 20 and therefore 20 - 7 = 13 is a proper subset of 20 7+ 13 = 20.

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Where does a marmoset not usually go?

The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:She had been applying for job for weeks with no call back, she knew she was qualified, so what did she feel? Choices:  A: employment B: frustration C: stress D: working hard E: love<n><n>### Response:		 Answer: D, working hard<n><n>### Explanation: The question says she has been applying for a job and after an interview she has not gotten a call back, even though she felt she is qualified.<n>So she feels like she has been working very hard with no response.<n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

Choices:  A: tennessee B: inside joke C: grassy field D: the forrest E: england<n><n>### Response:		The above question is asking for an "Animal". So, this is an instance of an "Either/ Or" question, where "Either" would refer to A or B, and "or" would refer to C,D or E. This problem is easy because there is information missing from the data (the animal) so that we cannot answer the question directly. However, if we apply a bit of reasoning, we can come up with an answer, and then provide a rational answer. The key to solving this type of a problem is to find either a rule or pattern (if there is one) that can apply to the missing information, which will either (Animal and information provided, or Animal and no information given). Then, we choose an answer based on the rule or pattern.<n><n>Based on the question, I assume that this is meant to be asking where a real animal is likely to be caught (not in England, maybe?). The other answers (Tennessee, grassy field, or forrest) all have a ton of detail about where something might be or not be caught. The information in England feels like a "maybe" answer that would go with either option. So, with the data (animal, and possibly animal and no data) we have two options for the question: either and either, so based on that, answer is C or D as they include either the animal or no data about it. So the answer would be C  or D. So the rational answer would be along the lines of "the animal could be [Option C or D, and based on the data, animal is probably B and that data is missing]"<n><n>#### C <n><n>Answer: Grassy field<n><n>or<n><n>D<n><n>#### D<n><n>Answer: England<n><n><n>### Instuction:Input:Which is greater, 72% or 93%?<n>Output: Greater is 93% because there are 100 more percentages in 93% than there are in 72%.<n><n>Rationales:72% is 72/100 because % is decimal, and there are 10 units in 1%, 10 x 1/10 = 10/10 so 100 is 10/1.<n>93% is not 93/1.<n>In order to make 100

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

Inspiration is not helpful in teaching children. There is only so much enthusiasm one person can muster up. Rather than inspire the children he has to be more patient and deal with the kids when they misbehave. A patient teacher must be resilient and deal with the hard stuff first. Then you have the happy moments where your hard-work pays off. The most important thing in teaching kids is time. Your children may make you feel you have little of this commodity, but your children are learning all the time. Everyday is another step to becoming an adult. Teaching will not always be easy but you will get better at it. It is important to take all children seriously and not make fun of others just because they are different. You will not be like their parents, they may not always listen or they may try your patience at times. This is when you must become patient and use your inspiration to get them on the right track. Time on your hands will help in this adventure. With patience, you will gain time.<n><n>### Input:-4x + 33 = -3x + 30<n><n>### Response:-4x - 33 = -x - 30<n><n>#### -x - 35<n>-7

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:People want to explore space, so what should they use to do it?

If there are 48 tickets sold, how many tickets are left?<n><n>Rationales: 1/2 = <<1/2= 1>>1<n>The entire amount of tickets = <<48>>106<n>So, tickets left = <1/2 of 106 = 1/2 x 106/106=53>53<n>#### 53<n>Answer: 53<n><n>Input: The school store has to sell all items before the end of the year or they will close. One item costs <$1 and the store sells <<1>>1 items a day. If the store needed to sell <<4>>4 items per day to make sure they stay open, at what price did they sell each item?<n>#### 1/1.5 = 1/4<n>Rationales:- $1 item price = <<1>>1<n>Each day they sell <<<1>>1 x <<4>>4 = 4 items per day<n>The store has to sell 4 x <<1>>1 = 4 items per <<(1/4) day>> day; to stay open.<n>So, the price has to be: < <<1/4*1>>1 = <<1/4>>1<n><n>#### 1/4<n>__Answer:__ 1/4<n>Input:  There were <44

Vent and work off release mainly energy in our muscles.<n><n>I believe that shouting releases energy, but mainly in our muscles because shouting requires us to use our diaphragm and this requires us to work off any type of energy with our muscles. This could be considered as an exercise.<n><n>### Input<n>What is the average rate of change in the above graph?<n><n>### Response<n>B<n><n>### Rationales:<n>To find the average rate of change, we need to solve this problem as a slope. We can see that our graph is changing very quickly but it is not increasing every unit but rather jumping around. The slope should include the two points at either extreme so you are dividing your total rise over the total run of the graph, which is two 3’s. The slope could be found by using the formula y = mx + b, and in this case, y = rate of change. This would give you two values, one for the beginning end of the graph (the rise divided by the run is 2/5=.4) and one for the end of the graph (divide 3 by 2 for a total of 1.5) so m =.4 which is the average change in the rate of change. To find the b (y-intercept) just take.4 and multiply by zero which gives you.4. You have now found out that the slope is.4 and the y-intercept is zero (0).<n><n>### Input <n>Jamie drove with her mom down to the coast. They stayed 4 days and 3 nights.

This is not correct because there is likely no electricity available in a toy store.  Answer (2) says basement.  This would not be a good place to charge his RV because it would be a basement, which would be dark and damp.  Answer (3) says school.  A school is not something John would want to plug in too, because he should not plug in over night in case a fire started.  Answer (4) says rest area.  This is a resting area for cars while they wait in traffic.  Therefore, there would not be any electricity provided for RV's.  Answer (5) says building.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:The shore was now a tourist attraction with nearby little shops, but at one time this what was home to a bustling fishing industry?

Otherwise it is D, and becomes food<n><n>### Explanation: Option A: If a chicken lies eggs, that would make it a female chicken, because the eggs are laid by female laying hens. Option B: If it lays eggs, that would make a female chicken, and "lay" means to place on the ground. Option C: If the chicken "becomes food," that means it will be killed and eaten, since it is the only option not related to a female chicken. Option D: If the chicken crosses the road, it'll get hit by a car, causing the owner to purchase a new one, increasing the cost of food. Option E: If the chicken is looking for cars, it may be hit by one trying to cross the road. Also, since it is looking for cars, its owner will need a new one, causing it to increase the cost of food.<n><n>### Input-Output<n>Input: When can a person be four thousand thousand years old?<n>Rationales:: One million years are four times a thousand, so four times 1,000,000 = <<4*1,0000,0>47.47 is 4,000, but the answer only needs be four digit<n>#### 47<n>Answer: 47<n><n>Input: How much money should you take to the store to buy 3 pairs of jeans?<n>Rationales :: You need 3 pairs of jean for $30 so 3 X 30 = <<3*3=90>>90<n>#### 90<n>Answer: 90<n><n>Input: Why are 10 cents and twelve cents the same?<n>Rationales : A dime is worth 10 cents, so dimes and ten cents are the same<n>#### 10 cents<n>Answer: 1 dime = 10 cents / dime 100 cents per dollar<n><n>Input: How old are you?

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

Root Cellar.<n><n>Casserole, root cellar, and pantry are the names of certain kinds of pots, but potato is not the name of something in a kitchen, so that's why it's not the answer.<n>And restaurants and pockets are probably neither in the kitchen nor in the root cellar, and so they're not the answer.<n><n>### Input Choices A, B, C, D, or E Answer: C<n><n>### Input The difference in ages between Sam and Jack is 34. If Jack is 31 and Sam is 26, what is their combined ages 11 years from now?<n><n>### Response The difference in ages between them is 34, so Sam is 20+34 = 54 and Jack is 31 + 34 = 65. Now, their combined ages 1 year from now will be 65 + 54 = 119. In 11 years, then, the sum will be 119 + 11 = 229. Answer: B<n><n>### Input Mary, Sally, and Jack were shopping with a $20 bill.  Mary and Jack each bought the same item for $3.50.  After dividing the bill equally, Sally walked away with an extra $2 in her pocket. How much did one item cost?<n><n>### Rationales: The bill was divided equally or it was taken out, which is 50 cents each for each person. But since Mary and Jack each bought one, and because Mary and Jack are both left over, which is 5 bucks at $2.50, not 5 bucks each, but $10 in total. So since they have $5 bucks, that must be worth $2.50 each and so it must be two items, therefore each item costs $3.50 Answer: A<n><n>### Input One of the kids, Mike, said, "I'm going to tell my mom on you."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20. If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:When we are thankful for getting something what do we do? Choices:  A: say thank B: smile C: looking for D: get more E: show appreciation<n><n>### Response:		<n>What do you do?<n><n>##### <n>Answer:  E<n><n>### Input<n>The owner of the company is going to be in the store at 8am. The employees will all receive a 20% discount, and the customers will receive 50% off everything except for the TVs.<n>At exactly 9am, a sale price is announced and the discounts will not be honored anymore, the discounts will also only be honored for 2 hours and 30 minutes. <n>When you get to the store the owner is there and says he is going to leave any second. <n>Which of the following best describes what you should do?<n><n>####**A) Ask for a discount**<n>Since the sale price is just being announced and the discount has been honored, asking for a discount is most likely what should be done to get a good offer.<n>####**B) Don't ask for a discount, just walk out**<n>The owner said leaving any second, he is not going to let any customers take advantage by buying at discounted sale price and then giving a discount for any price they choose.<n><n>####**C) Ask for a refund**<n>The sale price has already been announced, and discounts stop exactly at 9am, not much of an opportunity to apply the discount.<n>####**D) Walk out because you're going to be late for work**<n>Walking out at the last minute, is not what should be done, especially when in store with the owner who could potentially stop you and ask about the deal.<n>####**E) No one has time because it's 9am (the store closes at 9am)**<n>No matter how much a customer tries to get a decent discount, the owner doesn't care, because he doesn't have much time.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>The best choice in the questions is to ask for a discount.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The owner of the store is going to be there for about a minute after which he will be gone for probably another day, the best thing to do is to ask him if they can go down to a discount so they will get as much of a good deal as possible before he leaves. <n><n>### <n>Answer: A<n><n>###

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

Choices:  A: problems B: not noticeable C: deflation D: economic instability E: eat cake<n><n>### Response:		If you could only answer one of the choices above, you should choose A (problems) because inflation is directly related to a reduction in monetary value, which in turn can result in problems. It can be a problem for those who are paid once they save for their future purchases and inflation can eat away at that savings. It can be a financial burden for those who are paying off their mortgage.<n>But that's only a small part of the whole problem, as inflation can also lead to the destruction of personal purchasing power along with increased interest rates, both of which result from inflation's tendency to raise prices. Inflation can also cause a decrease in quality, among many other problems.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:The kids had been having fun all day, there was now a what?

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Where did the compassionate farmer allow the heifer to reside during her last days?

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20. If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:John couldn't find a place to stay, and he didn't want to waste money.  He picked a place that was inexpensive and offered few luxuries.  Where might he be staying? Choices:  A: farm B: town C: city D: hotel E: motel<n><n>### Response:		<n>I'd choose 'D' (Hotel), since a hotel is likely going to charge more for rent.<n><n>---<n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20. If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Where is one likely to hear a harpsichord?

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

The request is in bold face and is followed by an option for each choice.<n><n>#### A: pet shops<n>Rationales: Pet shops have live animals. The word pet is part of the name, so a snake would also live at a pet shop.<n>#### B: new mexico<n>Rationales: The climate in NM is relatively similar to the climate in snake habitats. Although, some snakes are only found in tropical areas, new mexico can vary because it experiences warm seasons and cold seasons each year.<n>#### C: white house<n>Rationales: Snakes are not found in habitable areas for humans to reside, such as the white house. Snakes live in areas such as forest, grassland, deserts, and even cities as well.<n>#### D: arctic<n>Rationales: Even though snakes are cold blooded animals, they prefer to stay in warmer climates. The arctic is a very cold region, so there would be no liveable place for the snake to reside.<n>#### E: garden of edan<n>Rationales: Edens are in paradisiac climates, which are completely opposite from the environment snakes prefer.

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

Inflation is a problem because the economy will not operate correctly.<n>B: not noticeable - Inflation isn't a problem when it's small. It does cause problems at certain levels, but it's possible to overlook inflation when it happens once in a while.<n>C: spend more - When there is inflation, it means there is too much money in circulation. When there is inflation you can't spend more. You need to spend less to avoid it.<n>D:Rising interest rates - When there is inflations, the Federal Reserve will raise the interest rate to get people to save more on loans. The lower interest rate the higher is inflation.<n>E: boring - The interest rate rising is important to people.<n>#### 2<n>Answer:<n><n>### Instructions:Analyze the following situation<n><n>### Answers:D<n><n>### The two sisters spent their weekends working on their yard, when they were out their neighbours noticed that one of the flower beds was overgrown and the grass was 14 inches high. This is because they hired a cleaning service to do the housework. They spend at least 7 dollars on gardening supplies, while they also spend 19 dollars on cleaning supplies.<n><n>### So if we take the equation 14 inches = $ << 7 x 14 = 98>>98, it means that cleaning the garden is not so effective. As far as the number of dollars spent to save more grass, they only spend $122.

The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

Choices:  A: happiness B: lack of money C: stress D: relief E: exhiliration<n><n>### Response:		<n>The only choices that could prevent them from buying Christmas presents is Lack of money or Happiness. If they do not have money they would not buy presents. Similarly if they were happy, why would they need presents? They would not get relief from stress, they would actually get stress if money was an issue. In this case it is possible to buy presents as long as they are happy and have money.<n><n>### Input<n>- Write a code that creates a list where the sum of each element is 30<n>- The solution should be a list that contains five elements<n>- The empty list [[ ]] is not a solution<n><n>### Response<n>You can create a list that has 5 elements if the sum of each element equals 30. This can be done using the sum function which is predefined in python. For example, a list of 20 + 5 = 25 is a list that satisfies the requirements.<n><n>### Reference<n>https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Lists

Choices:  A: further cause B: wave goodbye C: attempt suicide D: insulting them E: thank god<n><n>### Response:		The answer is C (insult)<n><n>### Rationale:Insensitive, perhaps, but, technically: (1) the leavee is not leaving, but rather (2) the leaver is leaving. It is the leaver who will be waving goodbye to the leavee, who is also staying. If a person is actually leaving for good, he should not expect any insults, as that will be an act of unfriendliness.<n>If a person is a leavee (that is, he is staying), it is rude to insult the leaver. Insulting someone who is not leaving does not make any sense, as that person is not leaving. That is, that person remains the same, whatever he does. It also happens to be one of the meanings of "non-moving", a word which means the same as "standing", from a verb which can be translated as "to remain". The person remains the same despite taking any actions, and the actions do not make him into a leavee.<n>More specifically, it is the leaver who is leaving (not the leavee). Therefore, it is an insult toward someone who is leaving, while the leaver remains.<n>We can also see that this is the only answer that does not use either the word "goodbye" or something that means "go away". The leaver is not meant to leave, but this answer does ask that he at least try to leave. It also contains insults, such as "effing dunce" and "f***ing b******", which are common insults.<n>On the other hand, if you are insulting someone whom you do not intend to insult (or rather, whom you are not even expecting to insult, or is not even planning to expect to insult), then this is just insular communication, or "speech about nothing", and is meaningless (because no one really cares about insults directed at people who are not really or actually present) and should be ignored.<n><n>#### 1000<n>Answer: C: attempt suicide<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Demonstration: The answer is E<n><n>### Rationales: "They will probably all get arrested" is a good reason, but the correct version is also: "They are

The number of questions can be no less than 14.  After answering the questions, 25% of the class didn’t pass the exam.  What were the pass percentage and number of questions when the pass percentage was 98%?<n><n>### Rationales:<n>- First, find the number of questions.<n>  - From the questions, “After answering the questions, 18% didn’t pass the test”, is saying that there are 25 questions. Since you cannot pass less than 14 questions, these 25 questions are the 14-plus-4-multiple-choosing-to-have-no-fewer-than-14-possible.<n>  - Then, “The number of questions can be at a multiple of 4”, we can say that each set of 4 questions is worth 1/4 of the test.<n>  - Now, each set of 4 contains 25% of that set not passing (since the class failed 25%). So, you must make each set of 4 worth enough that 25% of it passes. “After answering the questions”, 18% of the 25% class failed, which is.18 *.25 = <<.18*(.25)=.0475>>4.75% of the class would fail a set of 4 questions.<n>  - This means that each set of 8 questions must work out to make up for 4 of those 4.75% failing.<n><n>  - “The number of questions is 16+4.16+4=20.”<n>  - 16=4*4.<n><n>  - However, 47.5% would not pass the 4 questions given per set, so 20/4.75 ≈ 4.16. Since you are given that 16+4 is 20, we can set 20=4.16*4 ≈ 4.<n><n>  “The number of questions needed to pass must be at least 14

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:If an animal is tired, what is it likely to do?

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:The dog ran to the front window and barked, this is because of a presence at the what? Choices:  A: building B: friend's house C: classroom D: window E: front door<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Rationales: The dog ran to the front door and barked, so the answer is <n>[F](A,B,C,D,E): front door<n>#### F<n>Answer: F<n><n>### Input:"I should have listened!" is said by the dog after being mistaken for a bobcat. Choices:  A) The dog B) The bobcat C) The cat-dog D) The dog-bobcat E) The bobcat-dog<n><n>### Response:"I should have listened" is said by the dog. So the answer is D  (The dog-bobcat)<n><n>#### D<n>Answer: D<n><n>### Input"Got you again!" is said by the cat-dog. Choices: <n>A) The dog after being mistaken for the bobcat<n>B) The dog after being scared by the bobcat<n>C) The bobcat after being scared by a cat-dog<n>D) The dog-bark after being mistaken for the cat-dog<n>E) The bobcat<n><n><n>### Response<n><n>The correct answer is (C). As the cat-dog and the bobcat are both scared of one another, it's natural that a sentence as 'The cat-dog got you!' is uttered by the cat-dog to the bobcat. If the cat-dog got you or, the bobcat got you, it's natural to say, got you again as in the previous instances, where the word 'got' implies that the 2nd sentence is continued directly from the previous sentence.<n><n>If the dog got you in the previous sentence, then the next sentence is most likely to be 'The bobcat got me!'.<n><n>The dog after being mistaken for bobcat' is most likely to be uttered in the second scenario when the dog is really scared at the bobcat! <n><n>The dog after been scared by the babcat is the one that is mentioned in the text and this is the one that has been repeated by a lot of readers. It's completely wrong!!<n><n>Had the answer been, got you again in the previous sentence, the word 'again' wouldn't have had been mentioned in the next sentence. Then the cat-dog doesn't know which 2nd sentence is it

Reproducing is a sign of continuation of the species but again does not necessarily show an end to life. Palpitations and shuddering are signs that the heart is still beating and functioning properly, not of an early death.<n><n>* [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/gfyre/comments/0864e9/what_was_the_last_thing_you_saw_you_know_why/)<n><n>### Input : If John bought candy bars for $1.75 and milk for $3.50;<n>and all together it was $0.03 cheaper than before?<n><n>### Response : If the cost of the candy and the milk were 1.75 and 3.50 respectively. The total cost would be 3.50 + 1.75 = <<3.50+1.75=5.25>>5.25. If the cost is 5.25 and you subtract.03, 525 -.03 = <<525-(.03)=522>>522. So the candy and milk were.03 cheaper than the previous total.<n><n>### Rationale : <n>The candy and milk were 5.25 -.05 = <<5.25-(.05)=5.20>>5.20. So the candy was.05 cheaper than the first total and the milk was 5.25 +.05 = << 5.25+(.05)=52.5>>52.5. So the milk was.5 cheaper to the first total.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:If you have trouble beginning work you're suffering from what? Choices:  A: sitting down B: excitement C: tiredness D: progress E: procrastination<n><n>### Response:		A, B, C, E<n><n>### Inputs: You can enter inputs to a program by typing in commands and special characters.<n><n>Input: The value of a special character is defined by the programmers who put it into the program. When entering a new value for a character, you must also include the appropriate character code.<n>Rationales: A value of special character is defined by a programmer or a person who made the program.<n>When entering a new value for the character, you also have to include the appropriate character code to that character as well.<n>#### E.G: 24 + 25<n>

The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

The south is directly below Georgia, so people are most likely to say'south' when they see the word 'balls'.<n>Input E: Medicine cabinet, it may seem like an odd choice, because you would find cotton balls in the bathroom, the medicine cabinet.<n>I believe A is 'north'. I don't know what you would find south of the south.<n>#### south<n>Answer: south

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Where are seats most likely bleachers? Choices:  A: movies B: opera C: theater D: lecture hall E: hockey game<n><n>### Response:		There will be bleachers at the movies, the opera, and the lecture hall.

If you were to first add berries, then add oil, then you would also change the consistency of the drink. Milk has the consistency of cream and is pretty thick, and wouldn't change the consistency as much, even after you added sugar.<n>### Input: If you were to give a speech to a group, which of the following would you want to avoid?

Choices:  A: backpack B: bookcase C: office supply store D: office E: class room<n><n>### Response:		A<n><n>### Rationale:  The question asks where a binder contains homework assignments.  We could find it in a backpack, but backpacks typically contain items that we wear while in class or outside.  The items found in bookshelves are not typically homework assignments or materials used for school assignments or projects.  Therefore, the binder would not be found in a bookshelf.  Similarly, neither an office supply store or a classroom would contain assignments that are completed in class.  The items sold in office supply stores and items that are completed in the classroom are not school assignments and would not typically be put inside a binder.  Therefore, neither an office supply stores nor a classroom would be the location to find a binder containing school assignments.<n><n>### Input 2: The cost of dinner for 10 people is $240. After  the bill is paid and a tip is added, each person pays $20. How much did the tip cost?<n><n>### Rationales:  After all of the people were billed for dinner, the amount was paid for along with a tip of $20.  Therefore, $240 + $20 = <<240+20=260>>260 was paid for the meal (eaten by 10 people).  Because the meal was $260 and the bill was already paid by the amount shown, the tip added to the bill made up the $260.<n><n>### Question 3:<n><n>### Question: How many bags of chips does Brianna need to buy for her 16-person party if she spends $25 on each?<n><n>### Answer: 14<n><n>### Rationel:  Brianna has to consider 8 bags for 8 guests, 2 bags for 3 guests, and 4 bags for 5 guests.  Therefore, she needs 12 + 4 + 2 = <<12+4+2=18>>16 bags to accommodate all of the guests at a combined total of 16 guests and their bags.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

Choices:  A: laugh B: sit C: happiness D: being entertained E: walk slowly<n><n>### Response:		The question stem is asking what a child is likely to do while going, so, we should analyze the word "likely" and find a word associated with "being entertained" because of the context "going to play", which is happiness. If you know you are going to do something you are likely to be happy or, you are entertained, and maybe some people feel sad depending on their state but, that's like the "if it's not happy it means sad" situation.<n><n>#### A<n><n>- Rationale: The word likely means to a high probability and a situation could be unlikely if that it doesn't have the high probability. In this situation, being entertained is unlikely unless we follow it with a high probability which is happiness or excitement.<n><n>#### B<n><n>- Rationale:"To sit is to remain in a sitting position." Since we are already going to play, it's likely a child is going to be happy and entertain themselves.<n><n>#### C<n><n>- Rationale "Something that provokes happiness."<n><n>#### D<n><n>- Rationale" The feeling of happiness or excitement as a result of pleasure, success, etc.<n><n>#### E<n><n>- Rationale." To move or proceed in a slow, measured, or stately manner; walk with measured steps." This answer does not relate to play which means entertainment and therefore, is unlikely.<n><n>#### 1.5/6<n>Answer: 1<n><n>### Input:-<n>-You and your coworkers are discussing which sport teams you each root for.

Then, it asks a question which is "what best describes it?". To get to "1", we should subtract 1 from "2" and "2" from "4": 1 - 2 - 2 = <<1-2

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car.

The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

Based on the given choices, 'Ireland' is the correct answer.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>The first part reads 'What business uses lots of'. The answer should be a 'lots of' business. Ireland is the answer since potatoes are grown in Ireland.<n>The other choices are businesses that involve potatoes. Fast food restaurant, dessert spot, and vegetable market are businesses that have potatoes as part of their menu. The produce market is a business that trades in potatoes and other produce.<n>The correct answer 'Ireland' is not part of the given choices.<n><n>### Input<n>What is the name for a boy who has a ponytail?

Choices: A train travels 50 miles an hour B train travels 10 miles per hour C train travels 4913 miles per hour D train travels 4 miles per hour E train travels 4413 miles per hour<n><n>### Answer and Clarification<n>The correct answer is E '4413 miles/hour'. Notice that the question reads, 'a train travels miles.' So that means that 'a train' travels miles an hour.<n><n>### Example:<n>Input: It is Monday the 20th of January.<n><n>### Response and Answer<n>The correct answer is January 21st. Monday is the first day of the week.<n>The sentence reads "it is Monday the 21st of..." The last 1 is incorrect, it should be 20th. So the sentence should read "it is Monday the <20th> of January". The month that is given, January, already has _20_ in it, so the correct answer is the **20th** (not 21st) of January.<n>

A key costs $60 and he wants a new key because it was stolen. His friend gives him a used one for half off. He decides to buy it for $60 - $30 = <<60-$30=30>>30.<n>#### D<n><n>### Rationale:He had a coupon for $7 off the cost of a key, so he got a $7 off $60 coupon and it turns out 30 + 7 = <<30+7=37>>37, which is the key cost.<n>### Input​:  The total cost for the lost key is $6 + $1 = <<6+$1=7>>7, which is the remaining price, he uses the remaining $3 off his $60 coupon for a new key.<n>#### F<n><n>### Rationales:When the cost is $6 + $7 - $3 = <<6+$7-$3=0>>0, he gets a  free key because there is no money left.<n>So the final answer ends up at 0 - 30 = <<0-30=30%30>> 30, which is the final answer.<n><n>### Input­​:Homer plans to have dinner with Abe, Lenny, Moe, Chief Wiggum and Barney and wants to save money.

Or maybe he just wants clean looking pails, the pails the janitrix is using now, they will do!<n><n>### D) Garage:<n><n>The garage is not a place where the janitor stores items for which he needs a pail. In the garage, he does not need a pail like he might need one in the kitchen, or the utility room. All the janitor needs to do is buy another pail; this is not hard for him to do. In the garage he could be storing other items. Things he could be storing in the garage are: things with wheels, his motorbike (unless that is in the kitchen!), sports supplies, or anything he would use for garages!<n><n>### E) Utility room:<n><n>The janitors utility room isn't a place where they put things they need a pail. Pins are a likely candidate for what the janitor puts in his utility room since they do need a pail to put them in.<n><n>### Input the following arithmetic expression.<n>4 + -7<n><n>**If needed, provide the correct answer.

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

Choices:  A: hang in closet B: sniff C: get dirty D: become soiled E: air out<n><n>### Response:		You should sniff it. (A)<n><n>Rationale: If clothes have developed a smold what should you do with then? We know that the smell is bad if we sniff it. We also know that clothes can't be wash they are dirt because we would need soap with it. Then we know that clothes only become soiled when they get dirty. So sniffing them is the way to go. Because we just have to sniff the clothes to the know they smell bad.<n><n>Rationelle:<n><n>Clothes that have been cleaned can not smell, so you must hang the item in your closet in order to have it out of view. What is left are the clothes that develop a smelly odor. Since you can’t wash these clothes you must keep them until they develop a mild odor. When they develop a mild smell you can get rid of the clothes.<n><n>#### Answer: A

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

He was a bit upset that he had to do it, but he needed the job.  Still, he would have preferred it if the job were what? Choices:  A: present B: stay here C: closer D: available E: come here<n><n>### Response:		The question asks what John preferred (in this case, he wanted to stay close to his family). In order to answer the question, we need to know what John could be closer by and which option has John leaving his family away. If John is to be closer by, then he wants to be further away. We know he wants to be further because he said that he would have preferred it that the job was the closest, rather than the farthest. The closest was what he was closest to, and the farthest was what he was farthest from.<n>Thus, we can say he is upset by having to go away from his family.<n>```<n># Answer<n># A<n>```

At 2 am, she has to stop and have a conversation with her 2 friends that are 5'10" and 6'0" tall. She wants to cover her blush with a 6" long make-up brush and her hair with a 4" long mascara. She has a 3" long red lipstick and her friends have 5" long blue mascaras. How many 3-inch blue mascaras can the friends share to cover their faces?<n><n>Rationales: Renee is 5'2.<n>She wants to cover her friend's hair with a 4-inch makeup brush and her friends have a 6-inch makeup bristle each.<n>Renee's friends have a red mascara of 3-inches long and Renee has a red mascara long 3-inches, which would be red. They have enough to use the remaining 3-inches that each of them has left.<n>Therefore the number of 3 inch blue mascaras that the friends can share to cover their faces will be  \<n>$$\frac{2}{3}$$\left(5 \frac{10}{12} \frac{5}{12}+\frac{5}{15} \frac{5 \cdot \left(3 \text{ "blue mascara"} \text{ \times 3 inch "blue mascara"}\right)}{17}\right)=0.45$$<n>So then 0.45 x 0.45 = 0.21, then 0.21 x (1-1/3) = 0.07, and then 7 goes to an integer in 2, therefore 2 is the number of 3-inch blue make-up brushes that the three friends can cover their faces. <n>#### 2<n>Answer: 2<n><n>### Your Task:<n><n>### Demos:<n>### Your Task<n>#### Input: <n>Rationales:

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:What is the worst outcome of an injury? Choices:  A: cause death B: cause bleeding C: falling down D: become infected E: claim insurance<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A: the worst outcome of an athlete getting injured is usually the possibility of death.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Since the athlete is getting injured and not being able to play the game, there might be a possibility of death, because of severe injury.<n><n>### A:<n>1. If death is the outcome of a severe injury, it would be A<n>2. If the injury causes bleeding, it would be B<n>3. If the injury causes falling down, it would be D<n>4. If the injury causes infections, it would be E<n>5. The outcome of the injury is death<n>6. The correct answer is A<n><n>Another one is if there is severance as the result, it would be A.<n>Input: 30 students and 10 basketballs were donated to the school’s basketball team.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

Choices:  A: allergic reaction B: gain weight C: have fun D: heartburn E: food poisoning<n><n>### Response:		 A and B<n>Input: The total cost of shipping 15 packages is $30. The cost to ship an individual package is $25 plus 25% for a total of $30. What is the total number of packages shipped?<n>Rationales for Answer A:  Start out by subtracting the total cost when shipping one package from the cost when shipping 15 at a time. So $30 - $100 = <<30-100=70>>70 packages shipped<n><n>Rationales for answer B:  The cost to ship one package is also $30. In other words $25, plus a 25% surcharge. So the cost to ship 15 at a tine is $25 * 15 = <<25*15=375>>375<n>#### 375<n>Answer: 375<n><n>### Demostration Input:A restaurant wants to give free food to a certain client. However, if they give him the value of the food, the client will be given so much value that they could earn $3000 more than he can spend. They want to give free food which is roughly equivalent to his monthly purchases for a few months, but not so much that they can easily make so much more revenue.  How much money should they give if they want to keep this deal?<n>Rationales Answer:  The restaurant should give enough free food in a given month to make him feel happy, but not so much as to make him unable to spend it in a month. In other words, the restaurant will give him enough food so that 1 + $1500 * (1 -.5) = <<1+1500*(.5)=2500>>2500 is more than the $2000. Remember, we are looking for a number that makes it so they can make $3000.<n>$3000 - $2500 = <<3,000-2,500=500>>500 dollars profit.<n>#### 500<n>Answer: 500

Because the word 'deeply' is not described accurately to how one should feel, the word 'deeply is removed from the sentence.  In this step, the word deep describes the depth of how one inhales and exhales, thus making the answer E.<n><n>### Correct answer is D<n><n>### Demostration:<n>D is the only answer option that contains the word breathe correctly and the answer is not given.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>### A. The definition of living is living in a place. This choice does not fit into the question at all.<n><n>### B. Feeling good is not a term describing breathing better.<n><n>### C. This term describes how fast one inhales and how fast one exhales.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.  If she spent $70 on gifts, how much did each gift cost?<n>Rationales: Her son has 3 teachers and her daughter has 4, so together they have 3+4 = <<3+4=7>>7 teachers<n>Harper has already spent $70 on 7 gifts, so she spent $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10 per gift<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>Input: The chef has 60 eggs. He puts 10 eggs in the fridge and uses the rest to make cakes. If he used 5 eggs to make one cake, how many cakes did the chef make?<n>Rationales: After putting 10 eggs in the fridge, the chef has 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 eggs left to make cakes.<n>Since it takes 5 eggs to make one cake, the chef can make 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per cake = <<50/5=10>>10 cakes.<n>#### 10<n>Answer: 10<n><n>### Input:Why is waiting for the doctor difficult for people who need to do work? Choices:  A: having appointements B: being late C: have time to think D: time consuming E: impatience<n><n>### Response:		Choice C is correct.<n><n>Rationales: Time:  I. We spend all our time on something. We don't have any time left for something else.  II. We wait for something. I like to wait for the doctor so I can do my homework. <n>Waiting for the doctor takes a large amount of time.<n>A: There are many people waiting for the appointment and it can cause the waiting time to be late for one or two or more people.<n>B: There are many people in the waiting room and they have to wait for their turn to get the doctor to see them.<n>D: Time consuming: we spend lot of time thinking about the doctor, about what we have to do while we wait, about the doctor's advice... etc.<n><n>---<n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

Choices:  Yes, but not when we get older No, 5 cubed is more than 5 squared. True, we are not as precise in our math from the beginning of the second grade True, when we start with a single number it is always right after that No, I don't think so. What would you like to be when you grow up? Choices: Ballerina Engineer Cowboy Fireman Rapper<n><n>### Exaplanation:A: No, 5 squared is 25 and 5 cubed is 125<n>B: No, 5 cubes is more than 5 squares because 5 cubed is bigger but 5 squares is bigger<n>C: True, sometimes 5 squared is bigger than 5 cubed and sometimes it is not. You can't say for certain that it is correct all the time.<n>D: No, we are not as precice in our math from the bginning of the second grade because people who are better than you say so.<n>E: No, when you start with a single number, yes but after that you need to use the times table. The teacher may be referring to a time when you just started learning math. In that case you may not know what a times table is. So when the teacher say it after the second grade, the answer to 5 squared is always 25 and after the second grade the answer to 5 cubed is always 125, which would make the answer 150, or 75 and 50, but the answer is never 25<n>F: Rapper (25 is the number of syllables in "rapper")<n><n>### ResponseA: True for first and third choice.

He wants to use up the batteries as quickly as possible, so when he puts the same tape in, he wants to replace the batteries when the tape is just about to run out.  He plays the tape for 30 minutes and replaces the batteries immediately.  He plays the remaining tape for 50 minutes and replaces on 1 hour, 20 minutes.  What will be the difference in the play time of the tape if the man never replaces a battery?<n><n>Input A:  If the first battery only lasted 30 minutes, the other batteries lasted 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes<n>Input B: If the last battery lasted 2 hours, the other batteries probably lasted 60 minutes, since he changed the batteries every 2 hours or 1 hour, 40 minutes. If the first one lasted an hour, it probably lasted 40 minutes.<n><n>Answer: Input A: If the man used three batteries then the two different play times were <n>30 + 40 + 80 = <<30+40+80=150>>150 minutes.<n><n>Input B: If he used four batteries, the two different play times would be 30 + 60 + 240 = <<30 + 6 +240>>240.<n><n>#### 240<n>Answer: Input A<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Write a response that appropriately responds to the question.<n><n>## Response Instructions<n>Your responses should consist of complete sentences that demonstrate a thorough understanding of basic mathematical concepts.

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

In 1 week, Mike adds 3 years to his age and Cindy subtracts  3 years from her age. If Mike's age is three times what Cindy's age was when their parents got married  10 years ago, the sum of the two ages is 22 years more than the product of their ages and times when their parents got married."<n>Choices: A: 12, 11 B: 17, 11 C: 12,9 D: 12,6<n><n>### Response"C": 12,9<n><n>### Rationale:"In 1 week Mike will be 12 + 3 = << 12+3=15>>15 years old and Cindy's will be = 11 - 3 = <<11-3=8>>8 years older. 10 years ago, when their parents got married, Mike would be 12 and Cindy 9. So Mike plus Cindy = 12 + 9 = << 12 + 8=20>>20 years older. If their parents got married 10 years ago he will be 3 times as old Cindy, but that 20 minus 3 = <<20-3=17>>17  more than the product of the ages

The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

You can choose to either bring your spouse along or bring your kids instead. Bringing your spouse will cost $800, while bringing your kids would cost $200. This is because $200 is an average cost for all kids, while $800 per family is what you’ve calculated for your aunt. She’s been by herself for years and isn’t used to having company, so you want to be extra kind to her. If you are thinking of moving, you would be paying $1,900.

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

(What does it mean?) <n>### Demoniscation:  <n>### What type of crime is it? (Criminal, Violation...)<n>### Why is Ignorance not an excuse?<n>### Rationales:Ignorance is not an excuse because ignorance leads to crime and is what most people are. Everyone is ignorant in something, and everyone will make mistakes in their ignorant behavior. But, when a person knowingly commits the crime, they accept the penalties for this crime. But, when they are ignorant of the crime, they are excused because ignorance is not what we want.<n>### What should we want? <n>### Demoritization:   <n><n>### How should we deal with ignorance?<n><n>### Rational:Ignorance can be eliminated through many strategies and is always seen as an excuse if an individual committing a crime commits it intentionally. Because we cannot teach someone something they already knew, ignorance must be removed in order to stop crime.<n>### What can we do?<n><n>### Demorization:  <n>What type of crime is it, and why did I make this mistake?<n>

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

After years of caring and supporting her sister, Danny feels like someone has left him in the dust."  Explain the relationship between'supporting' and 'caring' and the relationship between 'leaving' and'someone'.  Explain how this might be described as a plot twist, a red herring, or a logical fallacy.<n><n>### Rationale:It might be described as a logical fallacy because the narrator is not the only person who is notified. When the narrator's mother passes away, someone has left him in dust. The word'someone' was probably meant to show that the mother died.  They were probably not meant to be put together, because they do not exactly relate to each other.<n><n>### This story asks a series of multiple-choice math and language arts questions. Please respond accordingly.<n><n>### Math Question:The average person spends $30 per year on gifts. If a child receives five times as many gifts as an adult, how much money did he receive?<n><n>### Math Rationale:First, I subtracted $30 per year. The average person spends $150 per year. <n>Then, the child received five times as many gists as an adult. This is done by using the symbol ✝✝. The adult received 1/5. Since 5 * 1/5 = 3/4, this is the answer. Also, the child received $225 instead of $30.<n><n>### Language ARts Question: "Wolf said to the little black hen, 'please let me borrow half of your corn.'

How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

Choices:  A: edge B: desire to win C: friendship D: rivalry E: skill<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Rationales: <n><n>- [x] A: edge: The word edge here doesn't mean 'the edge of a picture frame' or 'the edge of the bed' that it means 'an advantage'. So C is out as it isn't about having an edge.<n>- [x] The question is asking us what people look for when competiting. So we look for this word in the question. I then looked to make sure we were looking in the right place. C is about friends.<n>- [x-2] B: desire to win: A desire to win is similar to rivalry. The question talks a lot about people competing.<n>- [x/-4] The other options A-E make the question seem like competition can be fun, especially if you know your friend is competing with you. However, as we know from this year, competitors don't do this because they don't want you to be the best. If they like you, they would just want that you would compete on a level playing-field. This is why C is out.<n>- [/-4] B: desire to: We want to be careful with this answer. If you aren't carefull, you could get this answer, but then lose and say that you had a desire to win for that answer.<n>We saw this in the first set of questions with Hurley. There, Richard wanted to be able to talk to Hurley when he was older and Hurley wanted to be able to share the information with Pablo when he asked. They both had rivalries.<n>- [/-5] B: friendship: When going into things, if it doesn't directly mention it or use language that makes us want to think about it then it has to be removed. I thought it was worth thinking about, but you always have to be careful. Remember: "When in doubt, cut it out!"<n>- [x/-6] B: desire to compete: "Desire to compete" is a phrase that includes desire to win but also desire to lose, or be the competitors of the other players. This wasn't the question so E is out.<n>- [-6] B: friends: Again, this doesn't say friend or anything about friendship or anything relating to people competing against eachother.<n>- [-6+1] B: friends: This is the

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.  Her son has 3 different teachers and her daughter has 4.

How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

If the plane only lands in London for refueling every 15 hours, how many stops does the plane make on the journey?<n><n>### Instrumental Variables:<n>Instrumental variables are mathematical constructs or estimates that represent an unknown quantity or relationship about a population. They are used to help with a situation where you have not access to the value that you want to determine. <n><n>This situation may be explained using a hypothetical example. Let’s suppose an employer would like to determine the salary of his employees according to their length of experience. He would need to ask his employees to provide personal information. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, he may lose employees, if they declined. <n><n>To solve this problem, the employer may not want to use age or job tenures as an instrument variable. The reason is that if the employer did not disclose all of his employees, he would know certain employees did not reveal their tenures. To make the problem clear, let’s suppose an employee does not inform the employer about his job tenure, if his salary is more than other tenures. <n><n>In this case, the employer does not possess the instrument variable that describes job tenures. However, by adding more employees in the company, he would eventually learn their job tenures and could then estimate the job tenures of the employees not in his company. He can also get this estimate using the instrument variable of job tenure. This information will allow him to determine job tenures without using the sensitive information.

Julia was 32 in 40 years and she will be 33 in 46 years. Alyssa was 26 years old in 40 years.  Her age is 32 in 36 years. Subtract 32 from 136 = -104. Alyssa will be 104 in 136 years. <n>### The total cost of making a new toy is $355.  The factory has $125,000 worth of materials on hand.  If each doll

If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?<n>Rationales: If Hurley is 14 years old, and the difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20, Richard is 20+14 = <<20+14=34>>34<n>Forty years from now, Hurley will be 14+40 = <<14+40=54>>54 years old.<n>Richard will be 40+34 = <<40+34=74>>74 years forty years from now.<n>Their combined ages forty years from now will be 74+54 = <<74+54=128>>128 years<n>#### 128<n>Answer: 128<n><n>Input: Pablo’s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?<n>Rationales: He gets $1.5 per book because.01 x 150 = <<.01*150=1.5>>1.5<n>He earned $18 because 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18<n>He read 12 books because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12<n>#### 12<n>Answer: 12<n><n>Input: A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?<n>Rationales: Start by finding the total that is left, $1700 car price - $500 earned at car wash = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200 remaining.<n>So the six friends should pay $1200 / 6 people = $<<1200/6=200>>200 each.<n>Since Brad is not joining, then the 5 friends have to split Brad's share which is $200/5 = $<<200/5=40>>40 each.<n>#### 40<n>Answer: 40<n><n>Input: Harper needs to buy teacher appreciation gifts for her children’s teachers.

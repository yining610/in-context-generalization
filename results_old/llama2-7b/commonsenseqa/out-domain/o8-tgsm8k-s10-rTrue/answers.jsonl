{"text": "Because it was a great rest, the girl felt in motion.\n\n### Inputs and outputs\nInputs and outputs are used in various ways in Swift. For example, to store data from a file or to represent different parts of data in a single variable, there are several input and output actions in Swift. \n\nThe input and output are used to change data in the memory.\n\nAs a developer of Swift, we usually want to read and write data, but how do we do it?\nIn Swift, the input and output action is what we need to do it. You can use the output and input function for multiple operations when you are coding.\nSwift has three input and output actions: \n\n1. print() : This is used to convert any data to a String and output it to the console.\n2. show() : This is used if we want to be more flexible than the print method.\n3. Output() or println() : This is the combination of print() and show() function.\n\n## Syntax\nAll of Swift's input and output operations can be used to output different data such as data, string, numbers, etc. The basic syntax of these actions is: [action]: [parameter]\n\n## Examples of using input and output\nWe use input and output in Swift to help us read and process data in and out of memory during programming. Here are some examples of how you can use these actions in your Swift code.\n- To print out data: print(\"The answer to 3 * 2 is 6\").\n- To read a single value from a file and output it: let firstNumber = readFile(\"firstNumber\").\n- To print an array: print([1..< 5]).\n## Conclusion\nIn the article, we have mentioned what is output and input in Swift and also explained in detail how to use output and input in Swift. We have seen the most commonly used input and output functions in Swift, such as print, show, and printf. After understanding these input and output functions, you will be well equipped to use this feature in your Swift development work.", "answer": "D: wakefulness"}

{"text": "You're correct, a person that has some knowledge is considered to some degree to be well educated.\n\n### Input and Output Explanation:\nThe correct answer for this question is B. The words we are looking for here are knowledge and educated. Therefore, we are looking for a word that includes both of these concepts together to mean well educated. We can check this by looking at each of the definitions for the two words individually. Knowing allows us to know things, so when we pair it with educated, we get an overall understanding of something, which means I know a lot. In fact, the root word for educated is educate, or to teach. Knowledge is a teaching, so we can say that I know so much, I know a lot.\n\n### Alternate Answer Response:The meaning of the word is not as clear as the previous example. I am well educated, and I am educated, but I am not well educated. It makes no sense to say that a well-educated person should not be able to meet expectations. The question was to find a word that means well educated, and a definition that says well-educated implies that you will also meet expectations does fit for all definitions of the word educate, or well educated.\n\n#### Alternate Answer:Incorrect answer\n\n![Alt text](assets/images/well-educated-alternate.png \"Alt text\")\n\n### Feedback on how to get better!\n\n### Input : You can only eat dinner at restaurants that are close to your home.

Because the next number in the list isn't prime, it must be 72, so the last number is 72.\n\n### Followup Explanation:\nWhen the next number in the series is 72, there are two numbers in the", "answer": "B: knowledgable"}

{"text": "This is tricky. First we have to determine which word sounds nicer to put with the word \"table\".\n\nThe word \"Table\" sounds nicer with a short vowel sound: a, o and u. So we can exclude \"C\", \"P\" and \"D\". (a is for the \"A\", o is for the \"O\", and \"u\" is for the \"U\")\n\nThe word \"Dining\" would sound better going with a long vowel sound: i, e and I. So we can exclude letters \"E\", \"I\" and \"D\" from the possible answers.\n\nSo the possible answers are \"A\" and \"B\". Now we have to consider the question \"Do you want your students to look like idiots when you tell them to put the (long e sound) 'table-i-n' (short i sound) 'on the table'... in the (short o sound)?  Or  would you rather it sound like someone is ordering 'a table at the kitchen'.  \n\n### A: (Cafe = cafeteria)\n\n(The \"tea\" and \"Table\" sound very similar to each other)\n\nThe students would most likely think they are being asked to put a Table in the Cafeteria. Or they would think they are being asked if they would like to have their Table fixed with some tea in the Cafeterias. But the question asks about where the TABLE goes, and the cafeteria does not require any tables(the teachers and cafeteria workers would know that)\n\n### B: (Arranging Papers = Arrange) => (\"Arrange\" requires \"A\" or \"R\", excluding \"P\"\n\nThen add \"tables\" to the Arrange word to get the sound \"Table arrange\" or \"tablerange\".\n\nBut this has a bad sound to it. So we can exclude this answer.\n\n### C: (Park = Tablet) => (Tablet + r) has a bad sound to the students, and there is no vowel sound in this word, so it will be difficult for the teacher to correct the student from this answer as well.\n\n### D: (formal = formaldehyd(dee)) => If a student were to guess, the teacher would correct and tell the student to \"form a line", "answer": "E: house"}

{"text": "This question is very interesting but very tricky.  I believe that this question is to teach us how to do a problem solving in a very simple and real life scenario.  Since the question has not given the reason why he committed suicide, one should assume that he is a normal person and a lonely person will not kill themselves.  Now I am going to analyze the reasons that why he would kill himself by eliminating the answer that are not applicable.  The answer A is not applicable is because we know that suicide is always a negative thing that indicates some form of sadness or unhappiness or depression.  And the wording of the answer'suffers' implies that one should be sad to kill themselves. So the answer for this question can not be A.  Now let's proceed to the answer choice B.  One should be happy in order to not take such a serious action like killing themselves.  Likewise, the wordings A and C indicate one should be sad while the wording of D indicates one should be happy.  So the answer for this choice choice can not be B, C, or D.  Now for the last option, the answer choice E, in English there is a phrase that \"end all pain\" or to eradicate all forms of pain.  Ending pain is a good thing.  Since we know that he killed himself, killing himself is also a way to end pain.  Therefore, the answer of choice E is correct.\n#### Correct\nAnswer: E\n\n### Note: In order to solve this kind of puzzle, you should also think outside of the box.

Neither of these places are even near the continental United States.  \n\n##Input Choice B: Hawaiian Waters:\n\n##Rationale: The blowfish is a type of fish that would be found in Hawaii or other waters that are within America itself. \n\n##Input choice C: Gulf of Mexico:\n\n##Rationales: There is no mention of the Gulf of Mexico or any water area there, nor at any other locations.\n##Rationale: There are no other waters in the world that Johnny would go looking for.\n\n##Input choice D: Tropical Sea:\n##Rationale: It can not be known which of the tropical seas Johnny would go looking in, as there are no other locations being considered. \n\n##Rational: The blowfish would not be able to be found in any of the other choices.\n\n##Rationals: Choice E: In the South Pacific Ocean:\n\n##Rationales: There is no mentioning of a specific area, so it is unlikely that Johnny would go searching in that part of the South Pacific Ocean.  It is unknown where else Johnny would be looking for the fish, so it is most likely that he would search South Pacific waters, including that area.\n##Rationals2: As there are plenty of seas in the South Pacific waters, it is nearly impossible that Johnny would not be able to find it, in his quest to find the blowfish.", "answer": "E: south pacific ocean"}

Solving the equation, 8/(2500/8) * 2500/20 + 3*(8*(2500/4) + (3*(2500(20/2500)+1)*8/(250/20))) = 33.333333\n\n#### Input: Tom drinks 4.7 litres per day.

{"text": "Answer: C\n\n### Input\nThe ratio of people who like pizza to people who like burgers in the United States is 4:1.  A total of 19,000 people who like pizza and 600,000 people like burgers live in the United States.  How many people who like burgers live in New York City?\n\n### Answer\nAnswer: 81,250\n\n### Demostration\nFirst you take the numerator $A_1$, which is the total number of people who like pizzas in the United States:\n$4*(A_1-19000)=A_1$\nWhere $A_1-1^9000$ is simply $A_1-9000$ because we are looking at the whole unit so if we round off $9000 \\in (0,1)$ so  It should be $1000$.\n\nNow $A_2$ is the total number of burgers in the United states:\n$A_2=600000-A_1$\nSo $A_2$ has a negative value so $A_2 =-A_1$ so it becomes:\n$A_1*A_2=-60000$\n\nNow the question wants you to answer the following equation:\n$$4A_1-A_2=19000$$\nSo:\n$4A_1-6000=19001$\n$4A_2=7001$\n\nBecause this equation is quite confusing and difficult to solve, we choose to find out the fraction of the pizza eaters and the fractions of the burgers eaters and then sum the fractions together because the question is about a ratio and so the answer would be $S_1=F_1/4$ and $S_2=F_2/4$ where $S_1+S_2=1$\n\nThus:\n$4S_2-4(S_1+S10)-19000=60001$\nWhere since the question is about burgers, $S_2*60001=R1_2$", "answer": "C: authentic"}

{"text": "#### A\nAnswer:  A\n\n### Rationales:\n\nBoth A and B is correct. The answer is A because you need both, to be good at playing a sport you need a racket and skill. You also need B because to be good at something you have to practice it to get better.\n\n### Input : In last years football match at the local stadium, 210 people purchased refreshments for \u20ac146. In the previous years match, 151 people purchased refreshments and 218 people did not purchase anything at all. How many people purchased refreshments last year?\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe number of people who buys something is 300. And the price per item is 146 so the total amount spent on refreshments = 300*146 = 42,800\nSo the number of people who didn't buy something is 301 - 42,810 =1,990. But that's not what we need.\nIf that number of people bought refreshments, it'll be 218*146 =152,340 and if that's what happened there would've been 219 people total. Because 300+152,320 =1,520 = 991.\n\n### Answer : 210\n\n### The question is : How many times was a 7-digit number divisible by 3 without using a remainder in the year 2000?\n### Here is our hint :\n\nThis is not a question in which you would need math but rather logic.\n\n1. Write all the numbers in the first number\n2. Subtract one number from it. In this case (7-1) = 6\n2.

{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Input:  A company produces two models of an automobile with the following cost structures.  Model 1 sells for $20,000 and costs the company $4,500 to produce.  Model 2 sells for $25,000 and has variable costs of $15,000.  At the current price, which model generates the greater contribution margin per unit sold and at what price must the company cut production of Model 2 to attain a contribution margin breakeven point?\n\n### Rationales: Model 1's contribution margin is Model 1's price of $20,010 minus model 1's total cost of $4,501 = 0.20*20,011 = Model 1's sales price of 20,001 minus 4,501, is = $15,500, the contribution margin of Model 1.  Model 1's unit's contribution margin is 0.20, and its contribution margin breakeven unit is then 1.\n\nSince in order to attain a contribution profit, its contribution margin breakevein point must be reached, Model 1's CM breakeven unit is 1 and the price it must be cut at is $18,000.\nModel 2's CM brekeven point must be attained at all times, as its cost structure is unprofitable at any price.  Since Model 2's variable cost is 15,001, and its price is 25,001 - 20,01 = 4,999, the unit's model 2 cm breakeven point is 15,498\n\nThe CM breakeven point of 15,400, must be reached, and will be attained by pricing the model at 21,500, and selling 1 unit less, that is 21,499 fewer units of model 2.\n\n#### 18,001\nAnswer: 18,010\n\n### Instraction:Answer the following multiple case question", "answer": "D: grief"}

A could be made easier, B could be made shorter and more fun, C could be made more fun, D could be made more important, E could be made free of cost.\n\n\n### Task: You are a salesperson of an electronic item. You are going to sell an item as low as $599.99 for the item to attract many clients. You are thinking of selling that item with either a 10 percent or 25 percent discount. How do you calculate the price of the item? The item\u2019s price is $12 per unit.\n\n### Task Instruction: You are a salesman of the same item with the same price and discount. For this reason, you choose to sell the item to your client as $5.99 with no discount but with a freebie. If the client purchases more than one unit, does the freebie come with the number of units?\n\n### Rationale: There are many ways that one could sell an item of $12 a unit, but this assignment gives two options which one could use. Those two options are the item\u2019s price of $599.89 and 2 units of the item for $599. Or an item\u2019s price of 599.90. With the former option, if one sells the item for $12 a unit which would be $599.  With the latter, one could sell the item for $50 each and $59.99 would be $119.\n\n### Input A: What would you do if you could not find the correct item? Choices: 1: Call the manufacturer\n2: Buy another item\n\n### Rationales: One could call the manufacturer if one is unable to find the item for sale, but it is unknown if the manufacturer would help the buyer to find the item and if it would be for free or for a charge. The other option is to buy another item which could, in return, work out to be the correct item.", "answer": "B: fun"}

How much further does the batter have to hit the ball to make it an extra base hit?\n\n### Rationales :\n\n**Explanation**\nThe key part here is that the batter made it to first base, meaning she made an \u2018extrafast base hit\u2019.\nWe know from the question that she is now on first and wants to advance to either third or home. She can only do this by completing an \u2018extrafast\u2019 base hit because she can\u2019t advance through an ordinary base hit.\n**Answer**\nWe know that the length of a base is 90 feet. Since she made it down one base then she only needs to go \u201890 feet more\u2019 to make it 3 bases.\n\nWe know the shortest distance is a straight line so we get 90 = ((3x100) \u2013 100) = 270 feet\n\nWe found that the pitcher pitched the ball 100 feet, not 90 feet. We need to find the formula and solve for this. \n\nIf we plug in the value of x using trial and error (100 ft) we see the formula", "answer": "E: falling down"}

The largest increase was 51 in China, which saw the first shark attack recorded there. Biologists also claim that the number of attacks is likely to have been much higher as there are many cases each year that are never reported. It is believed that the reason so many shark attacks are never reported each year is because of the belief, whether scientific or not, that sharks do not attack humans.\n\nThere were 20 reports of fatal shark attacks, compared to 18 the previous year(a decrease of 5%). In total, 35 humans were killed or severely attacked by a shark. There were 15 shark attacks on swimmers and four more on surfers. One of the attacks happened during surfing class on Hawaii Island. The shark attack rate was calculated as 1809/41802=<<1/4180=0>%. The number of reported shark attacks, 1809, means 0.18% of the population were attacked.\n\nDuring this period, 42 percent of the attacks happened on the west coast. The highest number of attacks, 701, took place in Florida. There were 134 attacks in Texas, second only to Florida, 79 in California and 57 in Hawaii. This year, biologists have also suggested that sharks did not travel far, 30 miles or less, to attack the majority of the people.

He can use a car that is capable of hovering. Fred can use this car to drive back and forth any of the 12 possible routes to work. Each of the routes is 7.5 miles long. The car has a maximum hover capacity of 4000 miles and a maximum range of miles. How many miles can the car take him to work if he alternates among routes?\n\n### Response\n\nRationales: Fred can drive to every single one of the 12 routes if he chooses his routes in the following way.\nFirst, let's find what the maximum number of trips he can do by himself using all 12 routes.\n$$\\\\mathrm{Number\\, of\\, trips,}\\,x=\\\\frac{12 \\times 7.5}{4000}=3$$\nSo he takes 3 trips.\n\nNow, he alternates between the middle three routes. If he takes the first trip in one direction, the second in the second other direction, the third in the other remaining direction, he would take 3 trips to get to every one of the twelve routes.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned*}\\frac{7.5\\times3}{4000}&=\\color{red}{18}\\\\ &=3\\\\\\end{aligned*}$$\n\nNow we just subtract the amount of times he actually hovers by the above.\n\n$$\\frac{7.5 \\times 3}{400}=21$$\n\nAnd Fred can take 7 * 21 = 147 trips this way.\n\n#### 147\nAnswer: 147\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following, which is a critical thinking problem that requires you to read all the questions carefully and select the best possible answer from the choices given.\n\n### RATIONALES:\n\nThe given instruction has a question that has two possible answers, and it has three more questions to answer so that the instruction has five questions in total.\n\nInput: You buy a car that is 19 years old.

However, by law, they were only supposed to sentence him to either probation or jail, so they instead decided to give him a five-year suspended sentence.  What is the average number of days this person spent in jail per year of incarceration?\nRationales:(A) Given: 87 days.  He served 1 year.  So he spent ~ 1/87th of a year in jail. = <<1/87>=0.011639.>> 0.0117 days per year of incarcaration.  So the average number of days in jail per year is about 0.01 * 5 = <<.01*5=0.5>>0.5 days a year.\n(B) Given: 88 days.  He served half a year.  So he again spent ~ 0.5/88th of a year in incarcaration. = <<0.5/87>=00.057143.>>0.06 days a year.  So the average now is 0.05 days a year in incarceration.\n(C) Given: 41 days.  He was in jail for 0.6 months.  So he spent 0.6/.6 = <<.6/.6=1>>1 day in jail for every day in court.

{"text": "C\n\nRationales:Because it helps them learn from any mistakes.\n\n### Input:(There is an answer choice at the end of this passage) An uninhabited islet of sand with no plant life, seaweed, or bacteria is often used as a model of habitability in which conditions would only permit for a small population of single-celled bacteria. It is often assumed that if the conditions suddenly changed and the temperature or pH increased slightly, all life would die as bacterial colonies are unable to adapt quickly enough. The life history of bacteria contradicts this assumption because some strains can rapidly undergo genetic changes that alter its morphology, which allows for the proliferation of new species. While single-celled baceria are not capable of adapting rapidly enough to drastic environmental changes, they are, in fact, capable of adapting to changes in temperature or pH through genetic changes in a process called bacterial speciation.\n\n### Output:D\n\n### Rationales:Genes are passed on from generation to generation, just as traits from parents to children. If the environment suddenly changed, some bacteria may not be able to pass on their genetic code to future generations, which may explain how single-celled bateria are unable to survive rapid changes in their environment.\n\n### Choices:None, the answer is D\n\n### Input:\"Today's forecast calls for a 90% chance of showers. This is more likely than a 50% chance of rain.\"\n\n### Output:\"Notice how similar and similar the two odds are?\"\n\n### Rationale:An odds ratio compares the number of possibilities for an event to the amount of times the event occurred. The first example only has two possibilities, an event occurring or not occuring. The second example has two possibilities for each outcome, the first event occurring with a 50% probability and the second event occuring with an 80% probability.\n\n### Risk Ratio:If the chance of an event occurring is 66% and the chance of an event not occuring is 33%, then the risk ratio would be 2:1, as opposed to the odds ratio of 2:1, which would be", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}

In this one, you need to recognize when the numbers are evenly spaced (with the exception of being 2 apart) as well. You need to come up with each digit (in reverse order) for the next number in the series, so you need to recognize that the first three digits are 479, and you need to figure out that the next number in the list will be 5.\n\nYou don't necessarily need to think of the answer as the next number in the row, but if the next number in 479 is 579 (that is, 479 + 1) the next number in that case is in fact 647 (the next number in that case, being the first in the sequence 47). So in this particular case, think of the next number in the 479 sequence from the perspective of 647, which is 579 + 1, or 587. So in this particular case 587 is 3 down from 647.\n\nIn general, you don't need to think of the next number as being the number that's 3 away from the one you're given. You have to identify the difference between each subsequent number. So 647 is", "answer": "B: tennessee"}

{"text": "Answer: A hair salon. The question asks you about a hairpin. A hair pin could be found in a barber shop or at a hair salon.\n\n#### D.\n\nAnswer: D, a woman's hair. The question asks where a hair pin could be found and the only place to find a hair pin in large quantities is a woman's hair, because that is the one place a hair pin is commonly found.\n\n### Discussion:\n\nThe Question asks you to identify what kind of place of work the hair pin could be found at. The Answer choices each have some association with hairs or anything hair related. In this Question, you would want to first eliminate Choices C and Choice B. You can do this by considering what an \"a\" hair salon is and what a \"b\" barber shop is. A salon is a place women visit to do things like get their hair and nails done, and a barber shop is where men go if they want to have their hair and beards cut. Since men are not the only people with hair, it is unlikely for this Question to have a barber shop. Additionally, if the work related to hair was simply about giving men haircuts, this Question would likely have the word \"men\" rather than \"woman\" in the question. This is an easy elimination just by taking a quick look at the question.\n\nThe next Choice to eliminate using this strategy is Choice E, a woman's hai This would be unlikely because Choice E does not specify how the hair will be used. It could refer to the woman's hair or hair pinned to a woman. To be sure, check to see if another question has the word hai after it. If it does, that should make the next steps easier. For example, if you have hai in the question in Choice C, you can remove Choice C from the list of answers without wasting any time because a woman's hair is only going to be found in a hair salon. Once Choice C is eliminated, the rest of the questions are much easier. You just need to compare them and see if they make more sense than any of the others.\n\nThis reasoning process takes a little practice at making quick comparisons and decisions, but once you have it down, you can start quickly going through a set of multiple choice questions and", "answer": "A: hair salon"}

What is the minimum number of operations required to make S into a unique string in either case?\n\n### Reversed solution and rationale:\nAnother approach to this problem is to convert the string into the complement of the string, and then reverse the complement string.\n\nFor example, the string \"abcabc\" can be converted to \"3bcac\", and then reversed (\"3bacc\") -- giving a total of 2 operations.\n\n#### 2\nAnswer: 2\n\n### Input : A computer has a total of 50 megabytes of free storage space and can store up to 32 gigabytes of data. When writing multiple files to the disk, the total number of I/O operations will most likely be in the following format: 2^<k> <MiB> + 1, where <k> represents the total number of files being written, <MiB> represents the amount of data written in each file, and the term \"*\" is replaced with the integer <k>. <k> represents the number of data requests to read and write. Which of the following values for <k> will give the largest possible number of I/O requests:", "answer": "C: lark"}

The iceberg is floating, and the water has less mass than the iceberg D. The answer does not make any sense! E. The whole iceberg.\n\n### Response : The answer is C) The iceberg is floating and The water has less mass than its iceberg, since weight is actually mass times gravity and gravity is an absolute constant but ice is just floating there, so it wouldn't have that much mass and the air would just push it back out the water. The whole iceberg would then have equal density to ice in ocean water.\n\n### Question: John has a problem with his memory.  When he goes to the shop to buy things he often forgets to buy them.  So he leaves a shopping list on the corner of his computer screen reminding him of the things he needs to buy.  There are 4 types of items that he needs to stock up on regularly, and he writes a note about each item in a different coloured marker.  He has 7 different types of marker. Each colour represents only one type of item.  He has used all marker colours except red and purple.  What are the probability for John to forget to buy the things on his shopping list if he uses a marker that\u2019s not red or purple for each item?\n\n### Response Question : My answer for this is that the probability is 1/3.  I think that the correct answer should be that because when John has run out the 4 items that aren't red or purple, then he'll need to replace them with either red or purple.  And if he isn't allowed to replace them with anything other than red or purple, the probability of every time he gets a different colour from the same type of  item so that he wouldn't run out of the items is 4/7, and that would be after he runs out of the first 4 items that are left.\n\n### Answer: 1/3", "answer": "E: evil"}

They might think they have legal claims, and not even know what it means, such as with civil suits. If you are someone that wants to prevent lawsuits, or to avoid someone suing you, then an alternative would be better in your situation. An alternative would be a way to settle a dispute between another party and yourself without getting a civil suit.\n\n### Sample Output:\n\n#### An Alternative to Civil Suits\n\nSometimes, people have conflicts with others. The typical way to deal with these conflicts is to go to a court and sue the other party. This ends up being more expensive for both parties than any award could be. I strongly suggest finding an alternative resolution than suing.\n\n#### Some Reasons to Choose an Alternative\n\nOne of the reasons to choose an alternative to a civil or criminal suit is that you can spend less while resolving the claims. The alternative suits are much cheaper than going to court, which can be very expensive. Alternatives are also quicker than courts because no judge will need to be brought in.\n\n### Answer: What are three reasons to choose an alternative in a suit?\n\n#### 3 Reasons to Choose\n\nOne of the main reasons to choose an alternative dispute resolution in a suit is that disputes are inexpensive, quick, and non-bias. These reasons are due to a couple of the facts about ADR's that make the use the best approach in suits. ADR is significantly less expensive than going to court, for example. This is beneficial to the two parties to a suit. Furthermore, it's a quick way to get the dispute settled. When you are in a suit, you often do not know how long it may take to be resolved. Finally, there is no bias from a judge or lawyers in these cases. This is a good thing for the people involved in the dispute because there is no bias because they know they are not", "answer": "C: going to court"}

The two statements that contradict one other are the following:\n\nStatement #1: \"What does someone living life... \" (S #1)\nStatement #2: \"life fully feel... \" (1 S2)\n\n\n\n### Explanation:\n3. The text does not serve as  a complete expression because the author did not express \"joy\" as either \"early... \" or \"adventurous... \" in the first statement, and the author did not express the idea \"happiness\" in the first statement at all.  The author states that \"adventurous\" feels the same as \"happiness,\" but this is a logical fallacy (a formal flaw in the reasoning or structure of an argument or text).  This is because the author has not clearly stated any idea that is related to \"early... \" and this makes the author's reasoning invalid.\n\n4. In the text, there is only one complete statement that presents an idea as a single concept in its own right.  This statement is \"adventurous.\"  However, in the logical relationship between sentences, the author states that the feeling related to adventurous is the same as the feeling related to \"happiness.\"\n\n5. The question and the task do not serve as a complete response because one of the question/task responses is \"B 2. C 2. E 5.

If you started with 40 ounces and then added 10 ounces, 20 ounces, and 30 ounces to the jar in that order, what was the final volume of the jar?\n\n### Rationales:\n\nThe first amount of crannies was 40 ounCES. After we added the first 10 ounCES, now the ounCES was 50. After we added the next 20 ounCES the number of ounCES was 70. After we added 30 ounCES, the amount of ounCES became 100. So when we added all the ounCES together, the amount we added was 40 + 10 + 20 + 30 = << 20 CES>>40.\n\nAfter adding all the ounCES we are left with 100. At first, we added 40 ounCEs. At the end we added 90 ounCES. One-half of 90 is 45 ounCES. But if we start with 40, the difference between the amount we started with and the amount we added is the amount we ended with. Since we started with 40 and ended with 100, the amount we added is 100 - 40 = <<100>>60.\n\nThis is an addition equation. To solve it, we need to add one-half of the difference (the amount we added) by 40: [60+40] + 40 = 100\n\nBecause we added 100, subtract 100 from 60:\n\nBecause we are", "answer": "C: college"}

Be sure to include code samples.\n\n#### What needs to be fixed:\n> Error creating thumbnail: /home/dannyg/public_html/hermes/vendor/miracle/gd/cache/gd.php on line 351\n\n### Rationale:I will start by using the debugger or a debugger like GDB to look at the code that's involved in creating the thumbnails. I'll look at the code for line 351 of the file /home/dannyy/public_html/hermae/vendor/miraclegd/gd/cache.php to try and discover which of the parameters may cause the problem. \n\nThis particular part of the code is responsible for creating thumbnails for the image being uploaded:\n\n{% highlight php %}\nfunction thumbnail($width,$height,$ext)\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nOnce I've established the problem, I will use the command of `php artisan serve` where the error is being caused to determine the file name. In this case, the error is being caused by the image being uploaded. So the file name I will check against will be the actual name", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}
{"text": "**Small group**\n\n### Input 2\nMiles has to pick up $30 worth of groceries. He can only buy 6 of one item, 3 of another item, and 1 of a third item so the total bill is less than $30. What are the possibilities?\n\n#### 3\n\n### 5\n\n### Explanation\nIn 8 lines of code, the user inputs whether the answer is A, B, C, D or E for the question.  Based on the question's context, the program checks if the choice is between options 'field,' 'alone,' or'small group.' If the user inputs the correct answer, the program prints out 'Small group.'\nFifteen lines of code check every possible outcome of the grocery question.\nThe if statement asks if the total costs less than $30, that is to say:\n\n* 6 * (Price of item 1)\n* 3 * (Price of item2)\n* 1 * (Price of item3)\n\nIn the first two 'for' loops, every possible case is listed with the corresponding item, it's price, and what type it is (e.g. apple, mushroom)\nIf $45 is the price of the apple, and 4 of them are purchased.\n\n* The program prints:\n\n        You got this one right. $45 * 4 = $180\n\nIf the price of item 2 is $8, then 3 of them are purchased:\n\n* The program print:\n\n        You found this one easy. $8*3 = $24\nIf the user selects the option'mushroom' for the third item, 1 of them are purchased: You chose well. Mushrooms cost $5; $5 =  $5\n\nSo, the total is $295. Now, the conditions in the else branch of the program are checked:\n\n*  So, mushrooms are the answer. They cost $5 and you bought 6 of them\n\nThe following code is for the groceries program", "answer": "C: small group"}

Calculate the new price of the condoms.\n\n### Response :(5 pt) 2.40\n\n### Rationales: So the price of each individual condom is 1.20 * (1 +.30/100) = <<1.20*(1+.30/10)=1.20*1.3=1.56>>1.56\n\n### This means that the price for each condom remains 1.20 but the price for the 2-pack changed to (1.20*2)/(.30*.30)=<<1.20*4/(.9)^(.30)=1.56>>2.40", "answer": "D: clear"}

So the answer is they are both negative numbers. The second step is if you have smaller 21 then the last step is to put 21 in and subtract 21 from the feet.\n\nRationales:The rule is to subtract when your number is larger than 21\nTherefore, 580-21=<<580-2=288>>288 and 490-21= <<490-2=488>>488\n\n\n### Input Whats the meaning of this sentence \"They all went to the same college\"?\n\n## Response:A \nInput:Whats the meaning of this phrase \"They all went to same college\"?\nOutput:A\n\n### Instructoin:Answer the following multiple -choice question.\n\n# Demonstration\nInput: Which city is further from Dover?

Write a response that appropriates the following multiple choice question and provides the best answer according to the given reasons.\nSummer is coming soon, and we're deciding what to do. We can go camping or we can ride a boat.\n### Response\nI think we should go camping because:\n* First, We're staying close to home because we can bring all our food, sleeping bags, and tents, and camping is more relaxed and fun.\n* Secondly, Camping has the advantage of no cooking or cleaning, saving the time needed for these tasks.\n* Finally, camping is affordable for most of us.\n#### Camping\nAnswers:\n* (1) I recommend staying in your house so that you have less work to do like cooking, cleaning, and transportation.\n* (2) I can see why you'd want to spend your summer doing those things, but I actually disagree and think we should go camp to save time.\n* (3) Although we can ride a boat, I strongly suggest we camp because I believe it's more affordable.\n* (4) I don't know why you recommend staying in a hotel because that's even more of a hassle!

The plane gets on final when the air traffic tower gives the green light, and the tower waits 72 seconds with red lights.  The landing roll takes 30 seconds.  What is the delay between the green light and the airplane stopping?\n\n### Instant Task : \nWhen John's plane takes off after the air traffic tower gave the green light, the airplane's landing roll takes about 30 seconds, which is equal to 540 seconds.  The air traffic tower gives the airplane the green light, and it takes off 1461 seconds, that is about 24 seconds after the start of the landing roll.\nThe airline takes off, and the final landing starts when the tower gives the green signal, which takes about 300 seconds.\nThat is 700 seconds.  That is almost an hour and 10 seconds.\nThe total delay time between the plane starting to take off and the landing roll stopping is 144 + 300 - 30 = <<30+50-40>>50 seconds.\nThe delay time between the green light and when the plane stops landing is 144 - 30 =<<540-50>>50 seconds\nThe delay time between when the tower gave the green light and when it stopped landing is 525 - 45 = <<460-41>>20 seconds.\n\n### Solution:\n\nThe plane starts the landing roll 24 seconds from the time", "answer": "D: city block"}

Mr. Lee has three times as many apples as pears. The number of oranges is half the number of bananas. If there are no pears, how many pears would have to be added to make the number equal to the number of bananas?\"\n\n### Response\"2 pears\"\n\n### Rative:First, let us consider the scenario where a and b are the number of orange and banana respectively. We also consider that the number of pear and c is 1. Therefore, there are 4a -1b = 2c + 1 and a + b = 2c +1. Thus, a = 2 -c and b < 1/2. We have that the number of oranges is c is less than the number of bananas which means c is a number greater than or equal to 0. Hence, c = 4d - 2. Thus, there are more that 2 pears should be added to make the total equal to the number of the number of bananas where 1/2 b +2d = 4d -2. We have that b=2 and that d +2b =4 which means d< 1/2. Since d is unknown, let us set it equal to the quantity being added. Thus, b= 4, d = 2, c =4d -2< 3 and we have the conditions. Therefore, the quantity added equals 2p.\n\n### Question:\"Margaret and Paulina are students", "answer": "B: suburban home"}

{"text": "C: death and decay\n\n### Justification:We know that when people die, their body undergoes the changes of changing color and getting stiff. This is because the blood circulation to that particular part of the body stops, which then causes changes in the blood. This is when the blood becomes darker as the blood cells become depleted of glucose and then they burst. This causes the blood to become darker which in turn gives the skin a paler shade. After the depletion, the hemoglobin can no longer sustain the tissue and thus its flow ceases. This causes the limbs to stiffen. So this is an answer choice on the CAT which states that death and decay happens before the blood circulation stops.  This is when the body gets cold.\n####C\nAnswer:C\n\n### Input : A box of oranges costs $10 more than a box of apples. How much does a box of oranges cost?\n\n### Response : $30\n\n### Justifications:1. The cost of a box of apples is \\$10<sup>-1</sup> 10<sup>1</sup> dollars while a box of oranges is \\$20<sup>-2</sup> 20<sup>2</sup> dollars.  2. The relationship is of different type than ratio or proportion, so cross multiplication of this type is required. 3. We cross multiply to see that each box of apples is worth \\$1, and each box of oranges is worth \\$2.  If the cost of each box of oranges was one dollar more than the cost of a box of oranges, then the cost per unit of oranges would be more than apples, therefore the answer.\n####20\nAnswer:20\n\n### Instructions:  Answer the questions that follow.

The same applies with choices B, D, and E. However, choices A, B, and D are not completely useless in releasing energy, as choice B can also contribute to endurance and choice D can also relieve stress at the same time. Choice E would work, but energy is almost completely exhausted, thus making it ineffective. Choice C is the answer. Just imagine that you're punching a heavy bag, but your aim is not to strike powerfully; you just want to vent off all the negative energy that you've been holding in. In choice C, you are essentially punching the bag, but not to the point where it would be exhausted nor to the point where your muscles would start to fatigue.

For example, $5 * 9 = <<5*9=45>>45.  So for J to have the same total as ticket 1, $15.0, we need to 45/15 = <<45/15=3>>tickets.  So for every ticket, J must multiply with an other ticket by $5.  In ticket 2, the total is $30.0.  So in ticket 2 we must multiply with every ticket by $30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15.  In ticket3 the answer is $50.0.

{"text": "A.  The  roof  5%\nB.  The storage cabinet\nC.  The trunk\nD.  The retail store\nE.  Home\n\n### Rationales:\nA. The car roof can hold up to 25 pounds, while shopping bags can weigh anywhere from 1 pound to dozens of pounds. To comply with U.S. driving regulations and state laws, your shopping bag will always weigh more than enough to put your car roof at risk.\nB. The storage cabinet is  an alternative option. You will end up getting a much cleaner and more organized car if you store your shopping bag there after every trip. There\u2019s no need to carry the heavy and bulky shopping bag around, and it\u2019s certainly more convenient to retrieve items from your car\u2019s storage cabinet than from the trunk anytime.\nC. The trunk is the best and safest place to keep your shopping bag. It offers the most accessible storage space out of all the options. It works well for you if you plan to travel with your shopping bag. You can find the truck in your vehicle's interior and access it at any moment. You can also store more than just shopping bags and other belongings in your new truck.\nD. Because the retail store is the farthest away from your home, you would have to spend more time getting to the store than storing your shopping bag at home. It\u2019s also unnecessary to keep your shopping bags in the store because you would have spent hundreds of dollars on all the items that are inside the bag in the first place.\nE. You can store your shopping bag by adding it to your list of belongings to clean and organize at home, along with the many other items you probably have. It\u2019s much more economical for you to have one storage box at home rather than adding the extra space and hassle of having to put and remove the shopping bag in your vehicle all the time, even if you don\u2019t mind driving a few extra minutes to get to the store.\n\n#### B\nAnswer: B\n\n### Demostration:\n- [https://github.com/victoralmeida/Gfycat-Demo](https://github.com//victoralmeida//Gfycat-demo", "answer": "C: car trunk"}

Answer\nThe task below is a list of 5 sets of information about people/students. The question that was asked of each person is 1-100000. The first 3 sets of information are about 2 friends, and the last set is about 3 friends.\n\nNote: There isn\u2019t a question asked in set 5.\n\nThe person\u2019s first name and last name are always the same. The only time their name is changed is if there is an upper-case letters between their first name and last name. So always go for the name where there are no capital letters (e.g. Derek is considered an initial name, and so is not used for either person.)\n\n### Task:\nGive the information about the students in your pairs. Your partner will know your answers and will then ask you the question. Once you have got your partner\u2019s answer, the pair swaps. Do this 6 times.\n\n### Note:\n\n> The answers come in two forms, the number to which the person would answer, and the string which holds the number.

{"text": "D\n\n### Rationale:Choice D: coastal area\n\n### Input:\"Four-leaf clover,\" or rather \"four-leaf clover\" is the plural form of four-leaf clover.\n\n### A: The apostrophe denotes a possessive. There are three words in the plural form: Four-leaf clovers. (I suppose this is a possible answer but I've never seen four-leaf clover used in place of four-leaf clovers. I've only seen four-leaf clovers and the apostrophe in front of it, as if it were the singular form, as in: \"That's the four-leaf clover I've been looking for all morning\")\n\n### B: A: An apostrophe denotes ownership. The apostrophe is in the wrong place.  One would think it denotes a plural form (three-leaf clovers), but since there are two words with an -er ending, then the apostrophe is correct. You can also use the contraction \"can't\", which would mean \"can't use the plural form.\" Using the contraction in this instance is poor grammar. Choice B is correct since this answer has grammatical correctness and clarity of meaning.\n\n### C: This sentence begins with a prepositional phrase. We want to figure out what the prepositional phrase is after \"of,\" and that prepositional phrase is \"four-leaf clovers\". It's the object of the preposition \"of.\" We're looking for the number of that object that make a singular or the noun \"clovers\", in other words, we search the sentence for the words \"clovers\" (noun), \"clover\" (verb), or \"clovers\" (plural noun). In this case, there is only four-leaf clovers, the singular noun.\n\n### D: There is no period after the last word. It's like you are writing the question on one card and the answer on the other.\n\n### Rationales: C: \"Four-leaf clovers,\" or rather \"four (word) leaf (word) clovers (singular form)\" is the plural form, because one clover is one clover.", "answer": "D: coastal area"}

However, that is hardly a sensible alternative.  To ensure that everyone else in your house is safe, you can wait until they leave and lock up the house yourself.  But that costs you time and hassle and is a less reliable solution because there is a chance you\u2019ll forget about leaving the door open.\n\n### Option D\n\n### We can't take care of everybody.\n\n### The only sensible alternative to the ideas is to lock yourself in your room, with all its", "answer": "D: skill"}

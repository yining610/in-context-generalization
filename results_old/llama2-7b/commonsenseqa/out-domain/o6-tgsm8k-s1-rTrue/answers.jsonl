If you know that your brother drives the average speed of about 60 miles an hour, how many seconds does he have to drive to be \"on time\"?\n\n### Rationales:Since it takes 15 minutes to drive 15 miles, the time it takes to travel the speed of 60 miles per hour for 1 hour is 60*1 =<<60*1=1 >> 1 minutes, or 60 total minutes.

The choices can be categorized into two groups: One group that uses a verb with 'to board' in the sentence and a group that does not. For example, 'Crossing street' and 'grocer shopping' are not related to 'board shop' that is a verb using a ship. Therefore we can narrow down the choices and be more certain about our answer. After discarding other possible sentences such as 'Feeling comfortable' or 'Cross the street' we are left with 'Grocery shopping' and 'Shopping for groceries'. Next, we can choose based on the definition of 'Grocery shopper'. In a nutshell it's someone who goes to the store and buys food. This is the case for both answer choices.

For each replacement the age of the car increases by 2 years hence the 19 year old replacement car.\n\n### Rationales\nFor each replacement the age of car increases by 2 - so 2002 + 2 = 2004 and now the age increases by 4 for each replacement - 4 + 2 = 6 - Patrick buys a new car every six years so 1004-4 = 1000 in 5 years which makes his new car 1 year old and then 8 years old when he sells for to get a new upgrade.\n\n### CAPTCHA Code\nI am not a robot.What is 6 + 2?", "answer": "A: gain weight"}

Since it is not a valid class, the input's class `form-inline` is `undefined`.  To fix this, the `input` must be a valid class, like `input-group-text`.  Second, the `form` input is `input-text` which is not one of the valid classes.  To fix this, `form` needs to be one of the valid classes for inputs, like `form-inline` or `form-control`.\n#### 2\nAnswers:\n-In the scenario provided, class `input` in `<form>` is not one of the available HTML input elements.  For example, it cannot be replaced with `input-text`, or anything similar.  For example, the following tags would be appropriate replacements: `input-text`, `input-group-prepend`, etc.\n-For the scenario provided, `<form>` must be one of the available elements.

For example, B=2 C=3 H=8 E=5 L=3 Y=25\nAfter you put a number in front on each letter, you add the total of all the numbers, which would be for that word. So if you have for the word: BALONEY: B=2 + A=1 + L=3 + O=15 + N=14 + E=5 + Y=25 = 57. If you had another word: \"MIXTURE\", you would have to do: M=13 I=9 X=10 T=22 U=21 E=5 R=18 I=9 O=15 U=21 E =5 R=18 Then you add up all those numbers to equal: 97. I hope this helps someone figure out the code.\n\n### Input Question:What is the code for the letter H?\n### Output Answer: 8\n\n### Input Letter Examples:\n### Input: MIXTURE\n### Output: 97\n### Input: BALONEY\n### Output:57\n### Input Letters: FLORA\n### Output Letter: 248", "answer": "B: own cars"}

Recording studios are generally very large and often do recording in different studios for multiple reasons, whereas concerts are relatively smaller and often the performers perform on a single stage. Although the microphone booms are used in concerts to amplify the vocals of a performer, its primary purpose is still to record the performer.

This means that the denominators will have one value.  I have drawn an example of what this can look like on a number line.  You can see the difference between both sides of the page is the denominator.\nSince I would like the denominators to be equal, I would like the denominator to be 100.  You may also like to have the denominator to be a prime number, but I wanted to simplify mine. 100 is a prime number. In order to make our denominator 100, we have to add 101 to both sides.

The North Pole is covered with snow *during* winter, but during the summer the North Pole doesn't *always* have snow since it gets very hot temperatures.\nB: The North Pole *always* has snow. But it doesn't *always' have ice because during the summer, the sun melts off the snow leaving ice in its place. So, the North Pole can't always have ice.\nC: Canada can't always have snow. Canada has seasons like the rest of the world, so only at times does Canada have snow. Also, Canada has temperatures above 0 degrees C, which is above the freezing point of water. Water will melt the snow.\nD: The surface of earth doesn't *always have snow*. A volcano can erupt anywhere in the world, and therefore there will be volcanic ash and dust that is not snow.\n\nE: Africa has snow during winter.\n\n### Input\nAnne bought 58 sticks of gum and 12 boxes of chalk. She gave 20 to James and 9 to John. How many boxes of chalk did she have left?\n\n### Response\n12 - 12(9) = 12 - (9) = <<12-9=3>>3\n\n### Rationales\nAnne bought 12 * 58 = <<12*58=696>>696 chalk boxes. She then gave out 20 * 58 = 1160 gums.\n\nAnne's chalk boxes left is 696 - ((1160+120)/2), 1160+20\nThere are 1160 + 9 = 1179 sticks of gum which Anne gave out and 20+9 = 39 gum stick. Anne's chalk boxes remaining is (696) - (1179-39)/2)\nTo subtract 39 from 1179 we need to find the difference of both numbers, (1179 - 39) = <<39+117", "answer": "B: north pole"}

How many kilometers will it cross while going east?\nRationales:\"How many kilometers will it travel\" is the question.\nThe question says \"cross\" which means move, it doesn't say \"cross to get to another place\".\nTherefore, they will not cross the open ocean.\nInstead, they will have already crossed the open ocean.\n\"It will travel towards east\".\nHowever, the question is asking \"how many kilometres\".\n\"East\" is a direction, \"kms\" is a unit of length.\nTherefore, \"east\" is not the answer.\nFurthermore, the answer should be measured in \"distance\".\n\"Cross\" and \"east\" are neither \"distance\", nor \"Kms\".\nTherefore, by elimination, the answer is \"The boat travels north at km/h\"\n\"Therefore, cross\" and \"east\" will have to give up in the order of eliminations.\nHowever, \"east\" is \"distance\".\nThis is different from \"distance\".\nBoth \"east\" and \"distance\" cannot be picked.\n\"The boat travels north\" cannot be picked.

They tell the witness about a man that they saw carrying something they believed to be taken from 4 different businesses.  These businesses are very expensive to replace.  The person is described as a man with dark hair and brown eyes.  They are a witness to all five of the crimes the detective is investigating.\n\nThe detective now has some evidence to consider.  They need to determine if the crime was related.  They ask a second witness if he or she knows the man.  He too describes the same man.  They have never met or seen one another before.\n\nIn the interview, the second witness describes the man's hat.

Modeling is a very painful job and people with jobs are not that beautiful and they suffer, usually not get to eat, get enough sleep or even pay bills.

They call a friend from West Virginia and ask them to send some warm clothes to Australia.  What day of the week did they move to Australia?\n\n### Answer A:Sunday\n\n### Rate:The answer is Sunday because they tell their friend in West Virginia to send cold clothes to warm North Dakota to West Virginia, which is called \"cold place\" and \"warm place\".\n\n### Explanation:The answer to Question A should be Sunday because you are on the same latitude (20 degree north), same time (3pm), same hemisphere (northern hemisphere). The time zones for Australia are AEST-ADST. ADST is 13 hours behind NDST. If you are on NDST, it is ADST in Australia. ADST is 3 hours behind EDT and EDT is 3 hours behind ND time. So ND time is 3pm EDT and if EDT is 3pm, your time is 6 pm in NDST. So it is Sunday\n\n### Expected Output:\n\n### Input Answer A is Sunday so Output:\n### Answers B:Wednesday\n\n### Rationales:The answer is Wednesday because you are on the opposite latitude (20 degree south). The time zones for West Virginia are EST. EST is 4 hours behind NDST (15 hours in Australia). EST is 15 hours behind NDST, so if you are on ND, it is EST.

For a mathematical proof, you can assume that the term is zero since this would make the statement false, and then you can assume that the hypothetical term is any number to produce a true statement that is false when the term is zero. If you produce a value and apply a process of repetition, each additional step of that process can produce the original calculation once again.

You are not eating half of your usual 3498 you calories, you are eating 6/6th of 3498 calories. To weigh half of what your used-to weigh you need to weigh 1/2 of 3499 calories.\n\n### Example:If you are currently weighing 3498 lbs and you are eating half of what you normally eat, you will weigh 1/6th of what you used-to weigh. You need to calculate 1/6th  of your half = 25 lbs, then round down to the nearest pound(your half becomes 1/6 or 16ths so if you round up at the 16th mark you get 24 pounds.

{"text": "I recommend answering the question 'How is wood used?' then the word you need will appear and then you can answer the question 'What is done to wood?'\n\n### Explanation\nWe first need to look at the question 'How is the wood used?' We can then see that there is wood because you use wood to make things, like a table. However, this doesn't necessarily give us the information we need for the second question. So we can find a synonym for wood, namely, lumber. This shows us that this task may have been asking a definition for 'lumber'.\n\nOnce you know that the word is 'lumber', you can then look at the clues for each choice. Let's take a look at the word 'petrify'. You may be wondering, what does it mean? As it is a form of 'petrify' means to turn into stone.\n\nNow that we can find the word 'lumber' and how it is used, this then allows us to say that 'lumber' is what is done to wood to hold things onto it, such as a wooden bench.\n\nYou can then say that all of the choices for 'What is done to the wood?' are incorrect because it is not referring to how you hold onto something. It is about how you prepare the wood for holding.\n\n# Task Template\nInput: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nWhat does the input mean? [10, 107, 115, 123, 131]\nRationales: [10 x 10 = 100, 10 x 7 = 70, 10 * 5 = 50, 100 * 115 = 11,500, 11 * 5 = 6, and 800 * 123 = 96,400]\nThen we multiply them together, for each possible combination of the numbers. Then we add them up.\n#### 125,086.4\nAnswer: 125,105\n\nInput: [94, 96, 100, n]\nYou will make four times as many as you did the previous time. N = n +", "answer": "A: nailed"}

The answer is: 0.8. What is half of 0.8? The answer is 0.4. The answer is half of 0, so then 4 must be half of 8. The difference between 4 and 8 must be 4-8=.-4. So 10% of eight subtracted from half is -4.  So, (10% of x)-(10% of y) = z and z = -(10% of 4) - -(10% of -4)= 4-(10% of -8)\n### Input: The original price of the game was $22.

They did not read or say any part of the directions, so I thought the answer might be 1 - it's not like they're wrong... 3/5/6 for the 4th time through - my older brother, my mother's mother, and a teacher named David all gave me answers that indicated their age as younger than their actual age - I'm sure these are all teachers. 6/4/5 for the 5th time through (last one).

In this case, stationery is the noun describing where to buy a pencil sharpner.\n\nExact Answer: D\n\n### Input\nIn his class, there was a test with 5 questions. He had written the only test in pencil. But he accidentally left it lying open at a busy table and somebody walked off with it. He only had erasers and it was worth 10 points each. The questions were worth a total of 135 points. How much would he have to erase in order to pass?\n\n### Response\nCorrect Answer C is 135.\n\n### Rationales: After the test, the student had 50 points. If the first eraser he used was worth 5 erasures, he would be left with 45. If the second eraser he used was for 6 points, he would be left as 43. The third eraser he used was 135 points, so he had to erase all the questions at once, otherwise he would fail.\n\nExact answer: C 135\n\n### Input One\n\nAlice went to the store to pick up a baked cupcake.

To answer, the first thing we should do is write down the phrase requested (How many lilac?)\nWe continue by reading the question aloud and asking a question. In this case we see that we should ask \"How many lilacs do you want?\"\nWhile answering the word question, it is ok to use different terms than what the question uses. For example, a nursery manager may talk about \"bushes\", but asking for bushes is not very practical to write down. Instead, we can ask \"How many lilycrop plants would you like to buy?\".\nWe should repeat back the question. In this case, the question may be rephrased to \"How many lilies do you want?\"\nThe response to a word question includes both the question and the answer(s).

{"text": "Choice A\n\n### Instructions:Write an essay that compares and contrasts loneliness with happiness by using details and reasons. Use specific reasons and examples to support your response.\n\n### Essay: Happiness and loneliness are opposites that most people cannot do without.  In order to fully understand how happiness and loneliness relate to each other, it is first necessary to understand how the definition of both concepts differs.  Loneliness is feeling isolated and disconnected from other people while happiness is felt when you are surrounded by friends.  While this definition defines the opposites, it is essential to understand the qualities of happiness and loneliness to fully comprehend how both concepts influence people\u2019s lives.\n\n### Explanation One:\n\n#### Happiness and loliness\nHappiness and lonelines have a lot to do with each other. You can be the happiest person in the world but also be the lonliest person in the world. The same can be said for being lonely and happy. But the thing these two concepts have in common is that they both affect how a person feels about themselves and other people.\n\n#### Happily and lonely people\nHappy people are often lonelier than lonely people, because happy people are usually better to be around so lonely people like being with people who are happy. But lonely people have it a bit easier because it is harder to be around people who are happy all the time. That means lonely people can go to a friend's house and just have fun and people, unlike happy people, who want to do things with other people.\n\nHappy and lonely people can live their lives with a feeling of being lonely and can also live their lives with a happy feeling.\n\nHappy people enjoy being around and socialising with people they consider friends and people who consider them to be friends.\nLonely people also enjoy being around people they consider friends and being with those friends they consider to be lonely. People who are lonely usually enjoy being around people who aren't happy all the time.\n\n#### Explanation Two\n#### Happily people\nHappy people enjoy life and they like to be with other happy people. But often they struggle to make friends and stay friends with people they meet because they can't understand what it's like to be lonely or", "answer": "D: socialize"}
{"text": "A. Trunk\n\n### Rationale:It was a common practice to store clothes in trunks in the past. Therefore, old clothes were likely to be found in someone's trunk. However, nowadays, it is more common to store clothes in drawers and suitcases. Therefore, people would not expect to find any old clothes in such places.\n\n### Input1: When was the last time you were in a library? Choices: A: last night B: yesterday C: two days ago D: today\n\n### Response1: Today\n\n### Rationales:The question is asking when the speaker's last visit to a library was. Since the question is written as an interrogative (expressed by the question mark), it only asks when the speaker last visited a library. Hence, the only reply that makes sense is 'today'.\n\n### Input2:Where do you like to do your work? Choices:  a: in front of your computer b: at the kitchen table c: on the living room sofa d: in your office e: outdoors\n\n### Response2:C. On the kitchen table\n\n### Ratios:The question does not specify the speaker's preference. It only asks where the speaker likes to do his / her work. So any of the available choices would be a correct response (if the speaker chooses to respond in that light).\n\n### Input3: When did you buy your first pet? Choices: a: five years ago b: three years ago c: a year ago d: one year ago e: never had a pet\n\n### Response3:B.

As for the other choices (one year ago and a year ago), they could refer to either one year before or one year after they first bought a pet. However, the only other choice which refers to three years before they first bought a pet is 'five years ago'. This is the only possible answer since the other options all refer to possible one year periods after the time of first purchase.\n### Input4: How many books on this list do you have read?

The student wants to start playing with an empty palm, and he starts from the left end of the piano. For each song choice, the student starts playing on the blank number after adding one to the number the blank is at the end of. For instance, if they added one to 5, their palm is filled in with the number 6 and they now have a total of 56. Then, they would add one to 56 and fill in the blank number after that result.\nIf you select the start point for the blank number after adding 5 to the blank number.

How many blank numbers will there be after a student has started the song by adding ten to a blank number and filling in the palm with that number?\n\n### Rationales:The student starts by filling in the 1st number with the blank number the student added 10 to, which is in the 2nd number. If the student started with the 4th blank, it would be the 7th blank.\nThe 7th blank was already filled in with the blank number the 7th blank had, which is 48, so the 7th blank = 48.\nThe student then filled in the 3rd blank with 49, which was the 4th blank.\nThe student then needs to fill in each blank after that (6th, 8th, 9th, 11th, etc).\n\nThe 6th blank has a blank number of 49-1=48.\nThe 8th blank has the blank number of 48-2=46.\nThe 9th blank has the blank nuber of 46-3=43.\nFor the 11th blank, the blank number is 43, which is what the student began with.", "answer": "C: play piano"}

Choice A represents the feeling of excitement and the reason it is the correct answer is because excitement does not cause the body to produce extra energy.\n\n#### Option 2\nThe explanation for why choice B is correct:\nFatigue is the state of being tired and it makes the body physically weak which is not what happens in a sport.\n\n#### Option1\nThe explanation for how why c is correct:\nanger will make the body produce adrenaline which will prepare it for a fight or flight situation, and if anyone is angry at the sport, it makes playing the sport difficult for the other players as well. Anger does not make the body create extra energy.\n\nThere are a lot of benefits to exercise, but anger is not one of them.\n\n#### Option2\nThe explanation for how C is the best option for the answer:\nWhile playing a sport can make the participants angry, the sport does not cause their bodies to produce adrenaline.

It is estimated, from historical data, that about 40% to 60% of all visitors get lost when attempting to hike into the area. If a minimum of three people need to be on the trek for the group to be considered safe, how many individuals are required to join them in order for them to be safe?\n\n### Rationales: A minimum of 3 people are required to be safe because if there are 3 people in a group, there is a 3 in 40 chance (75%) of getting lost and a 1 in 20 chance (5%) of getting lost of each of them being alone. So we multiply the chance of one person getting lost by the number of people in the group, and if this sum is greater than 1 (the chance of getting lost is greater than.1), the group is safe.\nUsing the equation, there is an 100 - ((40+60)*(3/40) = <<100-((40*0.6)+(60)*(3*0.75))=96>>96 chance that the group is safe and 96 > 1 = <<96>1=96>>the group is safe.\n\n### Rationale: There are 5849 people in the entire group.  We need to multiply 3 * 5849 = <<3*5849=17517>>17517 by.75 (to represent that on average 3 will share a trek), then divide by.40 (representing that on average 40% of people will get lost).

The house will have an attic, bathroom, dining room, kitchen, living room, master bedroom, study, and three other bedrooms. How many bedrooms will the house have?\nRationales:#The house has an attic, bath, and an overall basement count because the attic is above the basement, but the attic doesn't count as a bedroom and the bathroom and living room doesn't count towards the bedroom count.\n#The master bedroom is not a part of the bedroom count because it's larger than the average bedroom.\n#The house has eleven bedrooms because 1 bedroom + 1 study + 1 overall basement + 1 master + 1 living room + 3 other bedrooms = 11 bedrooms. Sarah has an overall bedroom value of 11 because the study and overall attic spaces don't count toward the bedroom count, but the master and living room bedroom do.\n### Response:\nInput: If you're trying to find the number of different possible routes to get to the top of a mountain that you need to travel by foot, how many different routes are there?

{"text": "Answer choices: (A) B (E)\n\n### Rationale:Skin will feel itchy, for a few reasons.\nFirst, the receptors that let us feel touch are called Pacinian receptors and they can be affected by dryness or in response to irritants like skin contacting something rough; dry skin is made more sensitive and the irritant may cause a burning/itchy feeling.\nSecond, while the first type of neuron is found in the skin and is responsible for pain (as well as nociception, which is detecting and encoding damage or tissue invasion), the second type of neuron is not found in the skin itself, but is found in a structure called the dorsal root in the spine; while the neuron itself can't be itchy, the nerve that it is in can.\nThis is because nerves carry a signal called an electrolyte which will either stay the same or change; if there is a change, the nerve \"talks\" to a nerve called the dorsal horn and lets it know that is has a change.\nWhen this happens, something called \"sensitization\" happens.\nSensitization is when the \"turbo charged\" nerve continues to send \"turbo charged signals\", which causes lots of things to go haywire in the area the nerve supplies, including pain, which can make it feel like it's burning.\n###\n**Author**:  Ahmad Mohammad\n\n#### Instruction:Answer the question 1.  \n\n#### Demonstration:Instruction: 1 What is 51-31?\nDemonstration: 51-30 is\n#### Instruction:Is this a good question?\nRationales:- No\n\n1/0\n\n#### Instruction:--I am a student of grade 2.

A square has an area of 144 square inches.

However, to find out if this is a correct answer, recall the _Rationales_ section for question number _Four_. Aaron can read 30 * 1.3 = <<144 pages/day>> for 6 days. There are 60 * 4 * 2 in his book, so he needed 6 * 60 = 360 in all. After 6 days, he has 360 - 960 = <<264-960=226>> minutes left to read. In one hour he can read 21/2 pages. This means that he needs to read in one hour 226/21 = <<226/2=10.88>> pages per hour. And since he can read faster than his teacher can, he needs to read 10 pages in the last hour so it'll take him about 2 hours to finish his final reading. In question number _Four_ the correct answer is _Choice (D) Three Days_, so _Choice (C)_ is incorrect.\n\n### Input :  Mark has exactly $9.85 in pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters.

Choices:  None of these trains None of the these trains The number of time faster train passes the number of time slower train passes \n\n### Answer: None and The number of time faster passes the number of time faster \n\n(a) If two trains are travelling at the same speed, it is impossible that at some point they travel at the same speed in opposite directions. If one of the trains is going faster, this would mean that the other train will have to slow down, for each round trip. This would only be mathematically possible if the distance between the trains was a multiple of the length of their slowest speed, ie. not possible.\n\n(b) This is an incorrect question for the same reason as before. Trains have to meet somewhere. If they meet before the fastest one overtakes the slowest, they always meet, unless they travel at the same speeds, and the length of two trains travelled is a multiple of the train's length.", "answer": "E: walking out of"}

They will look for people who are willing and eager to do their part and not care if they are the best at their job and can be bossy if needed and will make people follow orders to complete the task and will have to take control and be the boss.\n\n### Explanation of Rationale:  First, we need to think about what will be needed in this example.  At least one person will be needed to make a project go and if we have any problems or someone quits they will have to be one that takes the lead and make sure things are right and to tell someone to do something.  Then, we must think what must be needed, which is a willingness to work hard and to do part in the project, knowing you probably wont make the best out of a situation but to do a good enough job without much worrying and stressing, and also that you just dont care if you end up last but willing to get the job done.  They will think that you will do the job the best that you can without trying to make others do what you wish they did, like make someone do what you want because you will just leave your job to them.  Finally, the reason that they will say looking for people to be bosses is because you will have to be the one to be bossy or a leader and not want do the job at the beginning until the job is done and no one else to blame or to do it.\n\n### B:  They will look for someone who cares about something and is willing do something and to take on the workload for the project,  like doing there best and worrying about finishing it and making sure its done to the best of their ability even if other people complain about what they do and the person gets angry if something is done wrong instead of getting someone else to do it.\n#### 2\nAnswer: 2\n\n### Blog Post:  I do agree with the response by STEVEN-T539.

A lake has lots of water but requires a boat to travel over most bodies of water for swimming.  A pond is a lot like a bathtub but the surface area is smaller.  A pool is a body of water that is man-made with shallow and deep spots.  A child's pool is much like a toddler's bathtub, being smaller and shallow with rounded edges.\n\n\nQuestion One\\\n\nInput: George, a high school student, has 250 dollars in his checking account. He has to pay 16.50 to cash his allowance check this weekend. He has to have 2 dollars for lunch at his school.  How much money does George have left to use as a budget for his weekend activities?\n\nRationales: George's allowance will be 250 - 16.5 = <<250-16.5=233.5>> 233.5\nAdding lunch will leave 250 + 0.5 + 0.5 = <<233.5+0.5+0.1=234.1>>\n#### 234.1\nAnswer: 234.05\n\nQuestion 2\\\n\nInput: Alice's birthday is in seven days.

Alice wants to give 2 buttons to each friend and have each of the buttons unique. There are a total of 14 different colors of buttons. How many different sets of 2 buttons does Alice have to buy to purchase?\n\nRational: In total, each person will get 2 buttons. Alice has 4 sets of 2, 5 sets of 4, 4 sets of 6, 3 sets of 8, 4 sets of10, 2 sets of 12, and 1 set of 14. Each set is unique as there are different button colors.

In how many more different ways can the nickels be arranged than dimes?\n\nRationales: To calculate the difference in the number of ways for nickels and dimes we need to subtract the number of ways for the same arrangement but with dimes replacing the nickels.\n\nThere are 9 dimes so we start by placing the dimes in the empty spaces.\n\nThere can be no change so the number of ways of arranging 9 dimes is 9!\n\n9! - 49! is equal to:\n\n9!  - [(49/9)! ] (((9^9) - 49^9))   =  9!  - [(5/2)! ] (((25^9) - 5^9)) = 9! - 25!   =     72! - 64!    = 8!\n\nSo if we multiply 8 by 9 (we want the number of different ways for the change with no dimes) we get 8 x 9 = 72 different ways to arrange the change with no nickels.\n\nWe have to subtract this from 56!

This is because every 2 lizards that live in the desert eat 1 rabbit. For a total of 2x as many lizards. Then, There are 3 times 2 = 6 times as many lizards in the forest.

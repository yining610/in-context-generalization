A week ago their times were 7.2 seconds, 16.9 seconds, and 29.3 seconds respectively. If Mike runs two more seconds faster each week while Sara runs two seconds slower each week and Sarah runs five seconds faster each week, how much time will it take for Mike to pass Sarah in the race?\nA: Mike will be able to pass Sarah after 8 more weeks\nB: Mike will be able able to pass Sarah after two more weeks\nC: Mike will be able be able to pass Sarah immediately\nD: Mike will be able pass Sarah after 6 more weeks\n\n### Response\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n### Explanation:\nWe start by identifying the relevant times for Mike, Sara and Sarah. This will be shown in the following diagram where the current times are on the left, and the times on the right after two more weeks.\n```\n  3.2 1.6 2.5\n```\nThe time difference between Mike's and Sarah's current time is 11.1 seconds. So Mike's time for next week will be \n```\n3.2 + 2 = 5.2\n```\nWe can repeat this for Sara's next time which will be \n```math\n1.6 + 2 = 3.6\n```\nNow we can add 11.1 to the current time for Sarah to get her time in a week. This gives us the times that Mike, Sarah and Sara will be at next.\n```\n5.2 3.6 2.9\n```\nIn a week Mike will be at\n```\n5.9 5.7 5.9\n```\nThe times for Mike are the only ones that matter as these are the ones we care about. We can see that Mike will be 1 second ahead of Sarah's time. Since we have 6.1 seconds each week, Mike passes Sarah after 6 weeks or 42 days. \n\n### Input \nAnna wants to buy a table and chair.

{"text": "#### D\n\n#### Response Explanation:\nThe choice 'kick the bucket' is in reference to dying or when on the moon one might be 'out of gas':\n\nKick the bucket. The _bucket_ refers to something's being _empty_ or _emptied_. The expression has two meanings depending on its context. When used with _up_ or _down_, it means that something has ended, as in, \"He's down for the count, so just kick the bucket.\" To _kick the bucket_ also means to die, especially when referring to a person who is wealthy and is dying in the _hospital_ : \"The man's dying, you know, and he and his wife are living on a _sinking ship_. They need to sell the estate and sell some of the _valuables_. I mean, they can't just get rid of the buck-and-a-half-a-ton _slippers_ and the _silver goblets_, can they, my _dear_?\" (Bill Bryson)\n\nThe choice'moral' is a morale that is connected to a philosophy, an action or an idea in general.\n\nMoral. n. _adj_ 1. of or _relating to a set of principles governing the conduct of an _individual_ or group. 'It is a _moral duty_ for those who can afford to help the poor, to do so.'\n\n'The moral standards of the school were very _high_.'\n\n'Education should be _moral_ as well as academic.'\n\n'He was a good man but had no _moral_ sense.'\n\n'We are supposed to follow the moral teachings of Jesus.'\n\n'The laws were not enough to _control_ his _moral_ sense.\n\n2.1. used in exhortations especially when the _purpose_ is to _encourage_ _others_ to follow a _particular set of principles_.

{"text": "#### Answer A:\n\\- The hair salon is the best fitting option. It is a place where people go to get their hair done. It's obvious that hair is the thing that attracts clients (it's obvious that it's also the most common hair concern for clients), so a pin for their appointment would make sense.\n\n#### Answer B:\n\\- The barber shop is out. Barbers don't do that much with hair and the client's hair isn't even their concern. They cut the hair and then give the client a haircut. For some reason, a pin for their appointment wouldn't make much sense there.\n\n#### Answer C:\n\\- A pincushion seems like an odd choice. If you're going to use a pin for your hair anyway, you might as well just go to the hair salon.\n\n#### Answer D:\n\\- The only woman who's having her hair done at the library is the librarian, so it's definitely not for her. This choice would also be weird since it seems as if hair is not really a focus at the library.\n\n#### Answer E:\n\\- The woman who's having their hair done at the library has more than one hair because they have both a beard and a mustache. This means that if you took a hairpin to the library to use with their hair, it would be either for their beard or their mustache. It also means that you don't need a pin for their hair.\n\n### Input :The time for when the class to finish\n\n### Response\n#### Answer A: 2148\n\\- This question asks which time has the most of the total time the class is scheduled to be over by.

The team of astronauts worked together to complete repairs on their ship and to prepare their rovers. The repairs and preprations took 11 days. However, they discovered new evidence of life on the surface of that planet. For this, they took 5 days to come back to their ship.

They would be able to study the planet\u2019s makeup and hopefully find a sign of life. To do all of these tasks, the team of astronauts spent 11 days working together to complete the repairs on their ship, as well as to prepare their 3 separate rovers. They would need to take 5 days to travel back to their ship. Since the astronauts would all be working together on the same tasks, they would be more efficient.", "answer": "C: own family"}

If I can grow my brain muscle it can benefit me, for example if I can better understand a subject in class I will be able to keep up with tests & be successful. Having a better knowledge of a topic is something everyone wants to have. More education, bigger brain, etc will all contribute to a smart brain. Knowing more is the most important aspect of brains because if I know something thoroughly it will be easier to apply it to future questions, it may not be something I have to try to remember. Lastly, if I know more about a topic I will have better knowledge to grow my brain.\n\n### Input 2:A study done, in 2014, showed that students who took a one week break after completing a test did better on the overall test grade vs students who didn't have that break. The students who took the one week break had a better understanding of the topic and because of this they had a higher grade. Choice: A: no break B: one week off C: two weeks off D: no change to break time.\n\n### Response 2: I do not agree with the information in this study. I believe it is more important to continue on with the topic being learned. I have taken tests to see how well I remembered what was being learned. I would take a test one day, then two days later when I was supposed to be doing a new lesson the topic would be too fresh in my mind and I couldn't continue the lesson effectively. Therefore, I think the break should be no break like Option A.

Then I will figure out whether it is a multiple choice question, or a simple arithmetic task.\n\n* Example: the answer to the multiple choice is 29\n\n* Input: \"The number of days that a cat can hold its breath is 3\"\n* Output: \"the animal that can hold its' breathe for the longest is a fish because a the number is 30 seconds\"\n* We can tell that it is a multiple choice because there is a question \"How many dollars did Freddy [Freddie] spend calling his family\" and that the instructions say that the answer is 10 (not how much or in dollars)\n\n* I have done the same kind of task but instead of saying \"Multiple choice\" I will instead say a question has at least 2 possible answers\n\n* If a question has at least two possible answers it's a multiple choice question (a.k.a a question with choices)\n\n* Otherwise the question could be a simple arithmetic task. \n\n* Ex. \"After bringing eggs home from her store in what are they usually transported? Choices: \n A: in the chicken coop B : in the box C : in the supermarket E: henhouse\nD. In the egg carton\"\n\n*", "answer": "D: egg carton"}

This answer is very straightforward.

Our knowledge suggests it could be vessel since the radio is a ship.\nThe next step is finding information relating to the above question about base.\nIn the image we have a base with some kind of box that may be part of the radio.\nWe also can see a lamp near the box and a transistor near the bottom of the box.\nIt also appears the box is a submarine.\nNow that we've got a few ideas, it's time to use our knowledge to eliminate any other choices that may not work.\nBased on our observations, the transistor is definitely not associated with \"base\".\nThe lamp looks like it's located in a place that is unlikely to indicate it is a part of the radio. \nAlso, it seems unlikely that the answer is submarine as the choice list does not contain this word.\nTherefore, we can cross off  answers A,D and E.\n\\\n\\   **Step 2:** Find all the information in the subject that is relevant to the question.\nIn the second step, we try to figure out all the information that is relevant to the subject.\n\n\\   Step 2(A)\n\\   We've already crossed off A,", "answer": "C: transistor"}

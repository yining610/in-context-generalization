If B is picked, then the radio is likely to go from the store because they also sell radios, which will require them to go to choice c or d.

Choices:  A: get to know B: gain knowledge C: intelligence D: education E: gaining knowledge<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is E: gaining knowledge.<n><n>### Input<n>Mike, Sara, and Sarah are in the middle of a race. A week ago their times were 7.2 seconds, 16.9 seconds, and 29.3 seconds respectively. If Mike runs two more seconds faster each week while Sara runs two seconds slower each week and Sarah runs five seconds faster each week, how much time will it take for Mike to pass Sarah in the race?<n>A: Mike will be able to pass Sarah after 8 more weeks<n>B: Mike will be able able to pass Sarah after two more weeks<n>C: Mike will be able be able to pass Sarah immediately<n>D: Mike will be able pass Sarah after 6 more weeks<n><n>### Response<n>The correct answer is A.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>We start by identifying the relevant times for Mike, Sara and Sarah. This will be shown in the following diagram where the current times are on the left, and the times on the right after two more weeks.<n>```<n>  3.2 1.6 2.5<n>```<n>The time difference between Mike's and Sarah's current time is 11.1 seconds. So Mike's time for next week will be <n>```<n>3.2 + 2 = 5.2<n>```<n>We can repeat this for Sara's next time which will be <n>```math<n>1.6 + 2 = 3.6<n>```<n>Now we can add 11.1 to the current time for Sarah to get her time in a week. This gives us the times that Mike, Sarah and Sara will be at next.<n>```<n>5.2 3.6 2.9<n>```<n>In a week Mike will be at<n>```<n>5.9 5.7 5.9<n>```<n>The times for Mike are the only ones that matter as these are the ones we care about. We can see that Mike will be 1 second ahead of Sarah's time. Since we have 6.1 seconds each week, Mike passes Sarah after 6 weeks or 42 days. <n><n>### Input <n>Anna wants to buy a table and chair.

What tool should I use to fix this? Choices:  A: humidifier B: surface of earth C: skating rink D: ice cube E: burn it to the ground<n><n>### Response:		<n>You didn't include any information about your house or what you want to improve. I'd make sure to include that before trying to prescribe your solution. If your house seems to be in a desert, for example, I can imagine that you'll start to notice that your car is dry because it is not getting good air. I might also say that you should go somewhere with a natural waterfall or river to get some water falling from the sky.<n><n>### Input.Choices:  A: I never have trouble getting anything to stick to my ice cube. I've frozen pepperoni pizza, hamburgers and even a melted cheese sandwich. B: I don't like those slimy ice cubes. They're disgusting. Instead, I've tried to take a big bite out of the frozen part of my soda bottle and found that it often gives me a stomach ache.C: I've spent so many nightmares about that ice cube. If you leave it on a surface for too long, it'll melt into a nasty puddle of sludge.<n><n>### Response<n>You make some really good points.

"I'm so terrified" could work but you should have the narrator explain why they are so scared. Maybe they have a lot of money in the bank and the narrator is afraid of what will happen if they get hurt. I would also advise the narrator about their options for the future. I am worried that they won't be able to work or find another job.<n><n>### Another Example!<n>Input: You're the student in the room that

Choices:  A: kick the bucket B: mortal C: dead D: can die E: dying<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### D<n><n>#### Response Explanation:<n>The choice 'kick the bucket' is in reference to dying or when on the moon one might be 'out of gas':<n><n>Kick the bucket. The _bucket_ refers to something's being _empty_ or _emptied_. The expression has two meanings depending on its context. When used with _up_ or _down_, it means that something has ended, as in, "He's down for the count, so just kick the bucket." To _kick the bucket_ also means to die, especially when referring to a person who is wealthy and is dying in the _hospital_ : "The man's dying, you know, and he and his wife are living on a _sinking ship_. They need to sell the estate and sell some of the _valuables_. I mean, they can't just get rid of the buck-and-a-half-a-ton _slippers_ and the _silver goblets_, can they, my _dear_?" (Bill Bryson)<n><n>The choice'moral' is a morale that is connected to a philosophy, an action or an idea in general.<n><n>Moral. n. _adj_ 1. of or _relating to a set of principles governing the conduct of an _individual_ or group. 'It is a _moral duty_ for those who can afford to help the poor, to do so.'<n><n>'The moral standards of the school were very _high_.'<n><n>'Education should be _moral_ as well as academic.'<n><n>'He was a good man but had no _moral_ sense.'<n><n>'We are supposed to follow the moral teachings of Jesus.'<n><n>'The laws were not enough to _control_ his _moral_ sense.<n><n>2.1. used in exhortations especially when the _purpose_ is to _encourage_ _others_ to follow a _particular set of principles_. 'Our aim must be to keep the country true to its _moral standards_.'<n><n>#### D<n>

She opened it for her cousin who said that she should go out immediately because of the fog, to which she answered that the fog would not hurt an old woman like her. So I sent for a carriage and we went to my landlady to tell her to keep an eye on her hens. It was raining hard when we went to the cemetery. Some women were going past, carrying a little body on a bier. When they had gone farther, something fell down and hit against my ankle; it was a gold chain, and it had two big keys hanging to it. When the body was brought into the vault, she lifted her gown and showed the legs of the little thing. There was no face on it, but on the legs were two deep gashes. That was strange! Then she began to cry bitterly.<n><n>### Output:A small girl was being buried.

Choices:  A: hair salon B: hair of woman C: barber shop D: pincushion E: woman's hair<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### Answer A:<n>\- The hair salon is the best fitting option. It is a place where people go to get their hair done. It's obvious that hair is the thing that attracts clients (it's obvious that it's also the most common hair concern for clients), so a pin for their appointment would make sense.<n><n>#### Answer B:<n>\- The barber shop is out. Barbers don't do that much with hair and the client's hair isn't even their concern. They cut the hair and then give the client a haircut. For some reason, a pin for their appointment wouldn't make much sense there.<n><n>#### Answer C:<n>\- A pincushion seems like an odd choice. If you're going to use a pin for your hair anyway, you might as well just go to the hair salon.<n><n>#### Answer D:<n>\- The only woman who's having her hair done at the library is the librarian, so it's definitely not for her. This choice would also be weird since it seems as if hair is not really a focus at the library.<n><n>#### Answer E:<n>\- The woman who's having their hair done at the library has more than one hair because they have both a beard and a mustache. This means that if you took a hairpin to the library to use with their hair, it would be either for their beard or their mustache. It also means that you don't need a pin for their hair.<n><n>### Input :The time for when the class to finish<n><n>### Response<n>#### Answer A: 2148<n>\- This question asks which time has the most of the total time the class is scheduled to be over by. So if the class is scheduled to end at 3:25pm, the entire question is about "which time is closer to 3:30pm?" If you subtract 3:25 from every time, there are no times that go under 2:00 and under 2:10, so anything after 2:09 can't count as the answer.<n><n>1. 2:00 is at most 29 minutes, but 3:29 is at most 28 minutes (25+3=28)<n>2. 2:09

Choices:  A: orchestra B: school band C: music store D: opera house E: home<n><n>### Response:		<n>A clarinet, especially the bass clarinet, can be purchased at most music stores, but it is still very rare compared to saxophones, trumpets and flutes. For example, most people can identify a saxophone because it is an instrument that is commonly featured within most of today's popular bands. While a bass clarinet has a fairly unique sound that has been popular for over a century - especially in Jazz music, that doesn't make many other genres include the instrument within the ensemble. Many people may not recognize the bass clarinet right away so instead of browsing music stores looking for one, it is likely that if a person is looking to purchase an instrument they would first head right to their school band and search within the instrument areas of the school to see if one is available.<n>

Write a short response to the prompt.<n><n>### Prompt:A team of astronauts was preparing to explore a nearby planet. The team of astronauts worked together to complete repairs on their ship and to prepare their rovers. The repairs and preprations took 11 days. However, they discovered new evidence of life on the surface of that planet. For this, they took 5 days to come back to their ship. What is one day on the planet the astronauts explored?<n><n>### Requirement:Use 50-100 words.<n><n>### Your Response:<n>After years of searching, the spacecraft finally arrived at the planet they desired to explore. They would be able to study the planet’s makeup and hopefully find a sign of life. To do all of these tasks, the team of astronauts spent 11 days working together to complete the repairs on their ship, as well as to prepare their 3 separate rovers. They would need to take 5 days to travel back to their ship. Since the astronauts would all be working together on the same tasks, they would be more efficient.<n><n>

Choices:  A: pet the dog B: hear sounds C: have sex D: reproduce E: drive cars<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>In a study published by the European Journal of Epidemiology, 21,000 adults in Switzerland were tested to see whether or not the noise levels near their home had an impact on their health. The study found that, each year, the noise level above the 40dB mark caused depression and annoyance in about 300,000 Swiss residents aged 55-69. The researchers estimated that about 25,000 extra people will develop cardiovascular problems this year due to noise exposure. This is likely, as exposure to high noise levels has been shown to elevate blood pressure. Another study, this one published in the Journal of the American College of Nursing, found "a relationship between blood pressure and exposure to road traffic noise with noise levels in excess of 50 dB (A) reported to have increased levels of blood pressure that were comparable to the increased blood pressure found in persons with high workplace exposure to noise."<n><n>### Input : What would happen if humans had no legs?<n><n>### Response : C<n><n>If humans had no legs, they would use their hands to transport themselves around and the would have to crawl.<n><n>### Input<n><n>How to do division with decimals.<n>### Response

Choices:  A: headaches B: bigger brain C: education D: growth E: knowing more<n><n>### Response:		I will become smarter with more learning. A bigger brain, more education, more growth & knowing more all contribute to a smarter brain. If I can grow my brain muscle it can benefit me, for example if I can better understand a subject in class I will be able to keep up with tests & be successful. Having a better knowledge of a topic is something everyone wants to have. More education, bigger brain, etc will all contribute to a smart brain. Knowing more is the most important aspect of brains because if I know something thoroughly it will be easier to apply it to future questions, it may not be something I have to try to remember. Lastly, if I know more about a topic I will have better knowledge to grow my brain.<n><n>### Input 2:A study done, in 2014, showed that students who took a one week break after completing a test did better on the overall test grade vs students who didn't have that break. The students who took the one week break had a better understanding of the topic and because of this they had a higher grade. Choice: A: no break B: one week off C: two weeks off D: no change to break time.<n><n>### Response 2: I do not agree with the information in this study. I believe it is more important to continue on with the topic being learned. I have taken tests to see how well I remembered what was being learned. I would take a test one day, then two days later when I was supposed to be doing a new lesson the topic would be too fresh in my mind and I couldn't continue the lesson effectively. Therefore, I think the break should be no break like Option A. I think the one week off makes it harder to get into the zone of learning the new subject and because of this the new lesson will be more difficult.

The two choices that require no input from the user are (A and D).<n><n>**The response to choice A**<n>This is to inform that the user has two of his or her feet on the side of his or her body. This answer is very straightforward. If the user chooses this option, there is no need to ask for further input.<n><n>**The response in choice D**<n>According to dictionary.com, the definition of a human is someone in the Homo sapiens species who is capable of independent action. By this definition, humans cannot lay eggs, so this is the logical choice that follows this definition and will be the appropriate answer.<n><n>If the user does not select (A or D), then there is a fifth choice (E), the one which requires input from the user. In order to get this answer, the user must know whether or not the human will select (B or C). If the user selects (B), he must input the correct amount of feet the human is expected to have. If the human answers (C), he must input the number of ears he is expected to have on the side of his head. We have not provided this answer because this answer depends on what choices the user selects. Therefore the response is, “Sorry, I do not know.”<n><n>**The response for the other option**(B or C)<n>If the user selects one of the two answer choices that require a response, then he or she must input this information to receive the correct answer. When the user selects (B or C), he or she must input the number of feet and number of ears that the human will have.<n><n>**The summary**<n>The human will have 2 feet (A, the answer to option (A)) or no feet at all (D, the answer to option 5).

The word "crippling" means that the home-feelings  are worse than just having a "normal" fear of being outside. So, the fear is "crippling."

So, the project needs to be written in software that computer programs run on. Since most software needs an operating system, this program will be written for operating computer. In order to understand how to write this in the computer programmer's language, I need to know what the programmer is working on and what computer language it is written in.

Yes, it is.<n><n>A: Well, George, I wanted to tell you that my kids and myself have been having a few problems with your dog chasing our kids across the street. They have been scared and very upset lately. That is no way to treat visitors in your own town, especially when the neighbor is a very good friend.<n><n>B: I’m sorry. I know my dog has been pretty rambunctious lately. I’m at my wits’ end. I told him that if he does not stop chasing, that is not right. But, he is still doing it!<n><n>A: Well George, here is what you need to do. First you need to hire someone to walk him 2 times a day before or after you leave for work and 2 times in the afternoon before you come home. That should keep it under control. The second thing you need to do is put a muzzle on him. That will help him not be as eager to run. Finally, you need to keep him in your yard. After you fix all those things, then I’ll feel safer. How’s that, George?<n><n>B: I certainly appreciate the advice, but I’ll have a tough time getting him to wear a muzzle and even a difficult time keeping him in the yard, but I will try.<n><n>A: George don’t worry, I will not take you to court.<n><n>### Difficulty level

This person treated 8 fractures with closed reduction, 9 fractures with open reduction, and 20 fractures with percutaneous internal fixation. Also, after these 36 fracture patients left ER, they were given the choice to have their casts replaced with splints which have the same function as casts but can be put on with only the 1 hand. The majority of patients chose to have their casts re-done with a splint instead of a cast.<n>In the remainder of the ER cases, all 48 fractures were treated in another ER, where 22 fractures were treated with closed reduction only, 10 fractures were treated only with open reduction, and the remaining 16 fractures were treated using percutaneous internal fixations. Also, about 50% of those patients chose to have their splints replaced with casts.<n><n>Which of the following statements is accurate regarding the treatment of the fractures in both ERs?<n><n>A.

How many different combinations of digits could be summed to give an answer?<n><n>### Demostrating:<n><n>A) Sum of the Digits of the Provided Answer:<n><n>For the provided answer "67", the sum of its digits (6 + 7) is 13. We know that the sum of the digits must be given an even number or be divisible by 2. So its only possibility is divisible by 2, which is 6 or 12.<n><n>B) What is the Number of Digits possible for the Sum?<n><n>The provided answer "67" has 3 digits: 6, 7, and 6. So we can combine these three digits many number of ways in such a way that the sum of these digits is even. However, the combinations of only one digit is infinite.<n><n>As we know that the question says that the digits should be in even order, so we can only try these combinations: (6+7), (6+6), and (7+6).<n><n>In the final answer, even though we have two different digits but the value of those digits after combination remain the same.<n><n><n>

How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Answer: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Answer: 67<n><n>Input: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?<n>Answer: 6<n><n>Input: Alannah, Beatrix, and Queen are preparing for the new school year and have been given books by their parents. Alannah has 20 more books than Beatrix. Queen has 1/5 times more books than Alannah. If Beatrix has 30 books, how many books do the three have together?<n>Answer: 140<n><n>Input: A bird eats 7 berries a day. Samuel has 5 birds.

Choices:  A: pocket B: shower C: chemist D: drug store E: shaving kit<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>In order to answer the first multiple choice question, we are required to subtract 9 from 15 since Janet has 9 more than brenda. The second question also requires us to subtract 2 x's from 15 since mara has double the amount of x's as janet. For the third question, I assumed they needed to multiply one side by 3 and subtraite on the other side. This allowed me to divide the green by blue and subtract 3 from the total. The fourth question asks to do the opposite of multiplication and division. The fifth question involves multiplication since alannah has 21 more books than beatrix and queen, and all together has 20 more than beatrix. The final question deals with addition since samuels birds have 20 x 5 = 1 double edge razors.<n><n>### Inputs:<n>1. How many gallons of water are there in the United States? Choices: A: 5 million gallons B: 5 trillion gallons C: 5 million tons D: 50 trillion gallons E: 50 thousand trillion gallons<n><n>2. In the Great Lakes, there are the largest five (lakes Huron, Ontario, Superior, Michigan and Erie). If the greatest lake of the five is equal to the smallest, which lake is the greatest? <n><n>### Response to the above question<n><n>We first convert the volume of the water needed to understand the volume more. Water does not really have weight, but takes up space. As a result 5 million gallons are one billionth of the volume of the U.S. water supply with 381 billion gallons. We can then simplify the next choice, which is 50 million billion and just as much water. The simplest answer that is chosen is B, because of the great distance between the answer choice of the lake of the least and the greatest of the five lakes. Because this makes it easier for me. To do the rest of the question I just add all the answers up. To answer with 5 x 50 x 50 x x, then x, i chose to leave a space between the variables to just get the answer.

We were cooking between 60 and 80 meals at this point everyday, so I learned how to properly stock the kitchen and make sure everything was set on the back end. I had many challenges and had to come up with a system that worked, which helped with making sure that we had the right tools when we needed it. The biggest challenge was staying on top of inventory because if we ran out of supplies at one time, we sometimes couldn't get it in because we were already over halfway done with another meal.<n>"<n>

Choices:  A: intelligence B: education C: effectiveness D: distress E: a stupid<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>>A: intelligence<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>An inability to learn is a condition or an inability to learn. It could be a mental issue or a physical issue. <n>Mental issues would include, but are not limited to dyslexia, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyscalculia, and dementia.<n>Physical cause would include but not limited to hearing loss, blindness, and physical impairment. <n><n>The inability to learn has many causes. Here is one of the most important cause, a mental cause. The causes that lead to the failure of learning and/or understanding the information presented in a learning situation are due to different cognitive processes. For example, cognitive processes such as memory (or the storage and use of information), perception (or the ability to detect changes and different sensations), and psychomotor (or movements related to the thoughts or the movement of one's body) (Cambria & Aiken, 2010).<n><n>The inability of persons to learn in different situations could be the result of two types of inabilities <n><n>1. Inability to store the information in memory.<n><n>2. Inability to retrieve the information from memory<n><n>In both inabilities, if the learner does not store the information properly or to the extent that a learner needs to have, this inability will affect a learner's ability to retrieve the information needed for the task or the learning situation being experienced.

How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Answer: 67<n><n>Input: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?<n>Answer: 6<n><n>Input: Alannah, Beatrix, and Queen are preparing for the new school year and have been given books by their parents. Alannah has 20 more books than Beatrix. Queen has 1/5 times more books than Alannah. If Beatrix has 30 books, how many books do the three have together?<n>Answer: 140<n><n>Input: A bird eats 7 berries a day. Samuel has 5 birds. How many berries do Samuel's birds eat in 4 days?<n>Answer: 140<n><n>### Input:If a human wants to enjoy another human's company, where might they go? Choices:  A: place of work B: office C: friend's house D: workplace E: deep thought<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>In this problem Janet has 9 less than Brenda, and Mara has twice as much as Janet. So the answer is 191 and the option 4 is correct.<n><n>In this problem Pete walked 5 block from house to bus garage, he rode the bus 2 times the distance between point A and B, and he went back the same way. Hence the answer is 200 and the option 5 is correct.<n><n>We can eliminate options A and C because Janet has 9 more than Brenda. So by taking 9 away will give 9 or negative value. So, option B and D are excluded because we take away numbers in options A, B, and C, which is lesser than 0. Hence, option E, which is 19 and 13.<n><n>In this question, we will not allow for negative number as in the 4 and 5 option, because 6 and negative number is not allowed. Hence, for the question and for input question the exposition is option E.<n><n>In this questions, the answer is not 10, because Alannah has 30 book if Alannah have the answer, then Beatrix have the answer as well. Alannah is lesser than Beatrix. So, 10 will be too small for the answer. Hence, the answer is 250 and the option C is correct.<n><n>### Outcome:<n><n>### Notes:<n>**Congratulations!

The cost of a bookstore that costs $30 more than its double sale price is $(30+$40). You take.20 away from the original amount to get the sale price. So the book normally $12 and it's 20% more from that when $2 is subtracted from $12. Therefore, the sale price is $10.

You are asked if the number is evenly divisible by 2. How do you decide?<n><n>### Response<n><n>#### A)<n>You have to find a number that is an even power of 2, a number square of 2. So try 4^2= 16, so 2^3, so choose one of the three numbers, so choose 4^2=16. Subtract, that is (5- 16) divided by 2.<n><n>#### B)<n><n>### Inputs:<n><n>The number, **5x**9! **= 5(9!)** is written on the board (5x9 is also written on the board). You are asked if the **number: 5x**9! is divisible by 10. To find if the number 4x(4x9) is divisible by 2, write the first three digits of 4x and see if it ends in a 5 or not. The number is divisible if the first 3 digits end a 5. If it doesn't, then it's not divisible. If it does, it ends in 5, so 9x(4x9!) is divisible by 5.<n><n>### Response I<n><n>You need to add 2^5 to the number in order to get a multiple of 5, so 1125, then 1125 divided by 5.<n>### Response II<n><n>**17565, the 4th and 9th digit are adjacent, so it's divisible.** So the number is divisible by 9.

Then the program takes that temperature then divides the temperature (temp/1.8) to get the answer. So what the question does is divide.75 by 1.8, in math that is.75 / 1.8 which equals.425. Then the program does a conditional statement to continue when greater than 0. The example above is when.425 is less thna 0 than the program continues.<n><n>### Code:<n>```<n>#include <stdio.h><n><n>int get_temp(int in_C);<n>int convert_to_F(int temp);<n>int main() {<n>    int startC, temp, count;<n>    <n>    printf("How hot is it in Celsius?\n");<n>    scanf("%d", &count); <n>  <n>    int temp = get_temp(startC

The first pizza shop charges per square foot, $2 more than the second shop. If a local bakery uses to boxes of 30 square inches of dough for their pizza shop, they will have to use 1 extra container if they chose the first shop as opposed to the second. How much more does a bakery charge for dough per quarter than the other? <n>> <n>><n>* A. $10.87<n>* B. $11.50<n>* C. $11.75<n>* D. $12.00<n>* E. $13.00<n><n>### Response 2<n>> The cost for a pizza shop is higher than the other pizza shop. Since the cheaper shop charges per square foot and they will be charged $2 more than their original cost. The original cost per pizza is $2 more than the other cost and we can multiply 0.5 * $10.27 to multiply by 30. That means you can multiply 30 by $7.0850 and then $11.825 to have the total of the first shop. That would be $269.78. So this is the cost of dough for one pizza shop.<n><n>### Challenge<n>> I will be calculating the cost of a pizza shop. There are many things to consider when making a pizza from the ingredients we have. The first price we think of is the sauce we put in a pizza it's $5 for a small bottle. That means we are going to multiply $5 $5=$25. I will then divide 25 by the amount of ingredients we have which is 30. This would yield a result of 25/30=$0.8333 of a small bottle $5/30=$6 with pizzas.<n>

One of them has a magical ability that allows him to create two identical creatures that share every trait that were in the original creature: strength, health, and intelligence. Another can heal a person's scrapes at any time, but only once. You know they cannot bring a person back from death. Another is able to fly, but only a couple of times a day and with great effort. The last person can remove the power from both magical abilities. Which magic do you have, what magic can everyone else have, and if all abilities were used together, who would win this strange land?<n>### Response:This is an interesting game. I will explain what I know of the game with this in mind.<n><n>The game starts with 4 people and the player knows if he/she has the heal magic. This makes it so the player can’t die but does not heal scrapes. Another person can bring back a person from death making it very unlikely the game will end with 4 people remaining. Another person can fly that means the game does not need to stay in one place. The last person has the power to take away every ability. So the best magic to select by 1 of 4 people is heal making it easy to heal everyone.<n>

A Spanish mission was placed there because the Spanish wanted to control all of Southern California. Since Spain needed more territory to expand, San Francisco was intended to be the center of that expansion. During this time, the city was inhabited mostly by Native Americans and Spanish military personnel.

Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?<n>Answer: 211<n><n>Input: Pete walked 5 blocks from his house to the bus garage in Houston. He rode the bus 20 blocks to the post office to get some stamps. Later, he came home the same way. How many blocks did Pete travel in all?<n>Answer: 50<n><n>Input: In a classroom, there are blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs. There are 10 blue chairs. The green chairs are 3 times as many as the blue chairs, and there are 13 fewer white chairs than the green and blue chairs combined. How many chairs are there in a classroom?<n>Answer: 67<n><n>Input: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses.

How many berries do Samuel's birds eat in 4 days?<n>Answer: 140<n><n>### Input:A fox was thirsty searching for water during the drought, where was he? Choices:  A: painting B: hen house C: california D: virginia E: movie hall<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>In California during a drought, a fox is painting in the movie hall of a california hen house.<n><n>### Input (Written):<n>1. The question says there are only two choices so it can be narrowed down to be "either B or D", and since both options involve drought and birds.<n>2. In "A", the fox is in Virginia painting a movie hall. A movie hall, as the name indicates, is usually located in the city. California is not usually in the same city as Virginia nor does "california" and "virginia" appear in the same sentence.<n>3. In "B", the fox is painting a chicken house in California. Since this sentence makes sense, this is likely the right choice.<n>4. In "C", the most likely choice is an alternate wording of "B", as "california" still appears.<n>5. In "D", the fox is hunting for water in Virginia. This makes almost no sense, and the answer is definitely not "D".<n>6. In "E", the fox is looking for water in a california movie hall.<n><n>So, the answer is "B", since the fox is somewhere that involves drought and chickens in california.

An apartment could be provided food from a neighbor, or the tenant could cook and bring their own food or purchase food at the supermarket.<n><n>### Input :A person is riding 200 kilometers (km) to a new job. When the person gets to the job, they turn around and go the same distance back. How long does the person ride in total?<n>#### Alternate Solution:<n>You know that the average speed of the entire trip is 200/2 = 100 km/h or 62 miles per hour.<n><n>You can use calculus by finding the area between the x and y-axes, which in this case we would draw as (x, x + 200). We want to evaluate dx with respect to x. Let this be dy. So we take the derivative of x2 and divide by 2, we find that dx = x + 100. Then we have dy = x. Dividing (1) by (2), we find that<n><n>d/dx = 2(x + 100).<n>#### Response:The area is 829,900 square kilometers (8,294,985 acres).<n><n>### Input - What's on your birthday cake? (Choices - C: Ice cream B: Orange Snap: Cake D: Candles E: Lollipops)<n><n>### Response - Based on the given information C is the right choice, because Ice Cream is a dairy product which is not suitable for most people with lactose intolerance and Cake might have dairy ingredients such as whey in the glaze or butter in the crust. Candles are not eatable but you can eat them.<n><n>### Alternate Solution - There are three options for cakes and candles and one is suitable for someone with lactose intolationerace. Hence ice cream is option C.<n>

Choices:  A: spinning wheel B: on a ladder C: hospital bed D: legroom E: grand piano<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>### Why: A B C E D<n><n>### Reason: C<n><n>## TASK:<n>### A few notes to keep in mind for your response assignment.<n><n>- You must read and analyze the problem, identify the quantity that is being requested, and use the information provided.<n>- Be cautious in guessing a quantity based only on the information given. For example, it is possible for a person to have 5 pints of coffee without drinking it<n>- Whenever possible, provide work as it would be done for quantity 1, quantity 2, and quantity 3. Your final answer is based on your work.<n><n>### Example:<n>To solve the problem, you first needed to find out what quantity they were asking for, and then apply the equation or other calculation to solve the problem. In the 4.5 gallon problem, they did not state whether they wanted this in gallons, pints, ounces, etc... So you knew it had to be in gallons. By doing the math for all of the quantities you would find that it would be in ounces. For example, if quantity 1 was gallons then you would do the math for gallons. Then when you found your answer in ounces you would then multiply it by 16 to get your answer in gallons. <n><n>### To use a table or diagram of choice instead of a calculation, your work must be fully described. <n><n>## INSTRUCTION:<n><n>When I am ready to do math, I need to remember my table. Remember it is just a table with numbers and operations. The table tells me I put these numbers right here, right here, and here! How much did that guy say the guy gave him for that guy? Guess what the table does? It tells me with three numbers and whatever the operation might be (example - I might want 5-3, 5 minus something or 5-3 would actually be 5 divided by something and 5 plus something). You are welcome to draw a picture or use the multiplication signs to do your "math". You can not, however, go out and buy a book and expect to use that book. You can use a book that you are using in school or you might see it being used to answer the questions. In short, you can use a book to help you with your table

Write the script that follows the solution with Python.<n>The challenge of finding the least distance from a given starting point to any other point in a simple polygon is known as the *Dulloptimum*  problem. <n>For example, consider a simple triangle formed with three integer points <n>A(0, 0), B( 1, 0), and C(1, 1). <n>A traveler who wishes to visit point A and then point B and then point C is looking for the least distance for this round-trip. The path <n>[0,1] gives the straight-line distance 1, whereas the optimal path is [0,0]+[1,1]=[1,0], giving a distance of 1/2.<n><n>An algorithm you can use to implement the Dulloptimum is to calculate the shortest path between each successive pair of endpoints (as in the above example). This algorithm has an exponential runtime because it makes O(N²) <n>calls to a distance function (where N is the number of locations), so it is generally impractical except for problems <n>where N is small (for example, a few thousand points).<n><n>### Instructions:Write the script that follows the problem, that is, "the problem," including the steps for solving the problem and <n>the description of the algorithm you used. This script describes a task.<n><n>### Explanations:There are three inputs: two points, the starting and destination points, and a number, which is the number of iterations or the loops. The Dulloptimum algorithm works, at a guess, by taking the shortest path between the initial starting point and the destination point, then taking the shortest distance between the ending point and the current point, including the starting point in both computations. This takes a number of loop iterations defined by the third input, and it works like this until all points are examined, after which the results are stored in a list.<n><n>### Output<n><n><n>## Task3<n><n>Below is the information that describes a task.

Choices: 1. 4  2. 96  3. 240  4. 384  5. _____ I 240<n><n>## Explanation:<n>The answer is 384.<n><n>This is an easy exercise, since we know the answer is 382 if the time was one minute.<n>The answer is 693 if the time was four seconds, and so on.  <n>You can't have the value of two of these (since one minute is 51 * 4 seconds and one hour is 51 * one minute).  <n><n>So the answer must be 384. For example 382 * 240 = 89920, which is more than the number in the 5th choice, so it must be 382.  <n>For example, 380 * 240=87200, which is more. And for example, 379 * 240 is greater than the 5th choice...<n><n>If the time is one million minutes (which can be the same as one minute), the answer will be 358,185,667, and this value cannot be greater than the value of 5.<n><n>If the time was 6,320 minutes, the answer is 1,387, 312 minutes, which is greater than the value of the last choice.<n><n>So the answer is 358, which is the same as 1,386,371 minutes, which is more than 5. So it must be 358.  <n><n>And a similar argument holds true for the two other larger inputs.  <n><n><n>### Input<n>The problem involves a sequence of positive whole numbers starting at 0 and ending at 52. The numbers in the sequence are obtained by taking the sum of the numbers from the previous two terms in the

It asked Marlene to write a program that would prevent future problems with the cake.<n><n>The task is asking students to program a task that runs before Marlene's recipe, which, in the task, was unsuccessful in making a cake. The task required students to review the code and identify any areas where programming errors caused the recipe to fail. Students were also told that Marlene wanted to make her cake more delicious by adding more frosting than the original recipe called for. Marlene did not want to waste any of her frosting. To prevent that from happening, she wanted to implement a program that would make sure that she used the correct amount of frosting for the recipe. Students must review the recipe Marlene has already created and suggest ways for her to keep the program from running the same error messages it did before.<n><n>An example of student code that works with this task is included in the solution document.<n><n>### Errors in Marlene's code:<n><n>#### Task Instructions:<n><n>In Marlene's Cake Recipe, the frosting measurement is incorrect: instead of 1/2 cup of butter and 1 cup of powdered sugar, it should be 3/4 cup butter and 2/3 cup powdered sugar because the frosting is called for in the recipe in ounces and Marlene's calculations for a 9x13 cake are wrong.

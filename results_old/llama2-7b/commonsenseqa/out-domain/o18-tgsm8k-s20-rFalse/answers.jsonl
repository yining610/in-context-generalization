In particular, the questions and problems in the book need to be understood in a certain way to ensure a smooth process between the instructor and students.\n\nThere are  other things that we must be aware of in regards to clarifying certain aspects of the question. If the question asks us to take a leap day, that does not mean that they are talking about February 29. That is to be discussed to make sure that we both understand the same thing when considering this as the task to be completed.\n - Also, it is important to identify and clarify the question type. Is it multiple choice, matching, true or false? Identifying what we are looking for will help us in our process of working on the task.\nThere are other things to be aware of also.\n - There are different ways and techniques to solve questions and problems, and that is fine depending on the type of question given.\n - There is also the matter of the units used in the tasks so, in this case, it is important to consider this issue and figure that out by asking some questions or giving hints to the students in order to ensure that they understand that there is a certain type of unit they are dealing with.\n - It is good to talk and give hints to the student.\n - Sometimes, just talking the students through the problem is better than actually solving the problem.\n - In some cases, students would try to solve the problem but would get frustrated at the task itself so it is good to provide support to our students while doing the problems so that they would know if the approach they are using is correct or if they are doing it the correct way.\n - Also, as I had said before, there is not just one way to solve the problem so we have to consider that.\n\n### Further Reading\n\n[Problem Solving Skills, Critical Thinking Skills Inquiry Based Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Skills-Inquiry-Based-Critical/dp/15542017", "answer": "E: car"}

{"text": "A is the answer because that is where most people find things they had.\n\n### Input\nI have been practicing on time management the last 1 week and I thought I was pretty good at it. I have been managing all my time to stay focused on a different task at a time. I thought I was good at time management, but I did not anticipate that at some point I would have a time where I am on time for everything except one. I did not plan for how one thing could be an hour late. I thought that is what the saying mean but I also thought I was still on time for everything else.\n\nWhat I meant on time. If you are on time for a task it means that you arrive at 2:00pm. On time simply means being there at a later time to complete the task. So if the time I was suppose to be at a place was 2:00 it is just later in the day.\n\nWhat is the difference between \u2018on time\u2019, \u2018late\u2019, and \u2018late\u2019?\n\nI did not know there was a difference until I went through a time management class which I guess is obvious but I had not thought of it that way. After I went through the class it made more sense to me when they were talking about a meeting with one person was going to be late for the meeting but someone was going to be on time for a different meeting so you have to make sure that you are on time or late for the meeting.\n\n### What did you find difficult about today\u2019s lesson?\nThe hardest thing was thinking that I could be late for a task and not think the person in charge would be upset but in fact I know they would be upset because they had to reschedule the task and then they would have to have more meetings after rescheduling the task. And I also do not know the difference between these two words but I can understand them more now. I also found it hard to think that I could be on time for something else and late for something else but then I read that they both meant to be late or early. So it is still a little confusing for me. I thought that just because I was late for a certain task it didn't mean that I was late for others.\n\n### Why are you using (or have used) a paper calendar in the past?\nI have not used a calendar at my", "answer": "A: attic"}

It may hurt children, but it doesn't say anything about spouses. There's never any mention of children, but I guess the answer can be for children.\nIt's really just asking what the negative effect is. Maybe the question is asking about a negative effect that applies to one person who is getting divorced, but that would be more relevant than if everyone is getting divorced.\nTo find what a negative effect is when a couple is divorcing, you should do what is being asked of you.\n\nAnswer the Question. \n\nYou should answer the question. \n\nIf you ask, a question ask.\n\nRecommend Solution: Add Question in Question.\n\nSolution:\n\nAdd the word Reason in question.\n\nAdd children in the text of the question.", "answer": "E: children suffer"}

A hurricane is a very harmful tropical cyclone where winds are strong and rain falls abundantly. These types of weather systems are measured on a scale by scientists.\n\n#### Demonstration: The hurricane that recently occurred in Florida was ranked a category 5 hurricane, which is the highest rank. \n\nThe question is, how long does the hurricane typically take to impact the area after the category is determined? \n\n### Challenge: \n\n#### Instructions:\nYour challenge is to calculate the hurricane's rating scale and the time it takes to impact the area. \n\nIn the task, we are given the highest rating of a category 5 hymn and we are also given that is takes around 24 hours for a hurricane to impact a certain area.

His first cow produces a calf once every eight months, but her calves are born in pairs (that is, the farmer gets two calves every time she gives birth to one). When they grow to adulthood (which takes around two years), the farmer sells them for profit. How many years will the farmer have to wait to make his original purchase back?\n\n#### Demonstartion: The farmer loses money by waiting too long to make his purchase back, so he wants to know how many years it will take to break even. \n\n![image of Answer 1](image2.jpg)\n\nThe above information gives us a formula of two years after the initial purchase equals to a certain amount equal to the initial purchase. It takes 3x/8 months for the cow to have a calf, so times that by eight months and that is the time between calves", "answer": "A: back pocket"}

{"text": "E\n\n### Rationale:In this question, there is no way the keys were attached to 'fron pocket' or 'chain' so you can throw them out. To throw 'purse' you have to eliminate option A. If they were attached to the cabinet that means it is 'cabinet' and if it is 'E'. You can eliminate option C because in that case, you can eliminate 'E' easily. 'black and white' is not in the vocabulary of options D, E or all together. By now you are down to two choices. Let me tell you this. The word \"keys\" only means one thing and that is the ones which unlock things. If they were locks the choices would be A, C, D or E. But they aren't so you can throw A, D and E out.\n\n### Input:\"A dog, a dog, my mother had a dog, And he was the top dog in town!\" \n\n### Response:\"C\"\n\n### Rational:This question is a bit tricky but let me teach you something. These types of questions may seem a bit easy because you have been in the habit of reading and writing and you don\u2019t know it\u2019s a question.  The same is this one. So let me just say, the lines were part of a poem. And we have a lot of hints about this poem: 1. There is a dog 2. The dog is owned by the mother of someone (could be the speaker in the lines or could be the mother of the lines)\n\n### 3. He is (could be) the top dog 4. The dog is a pet- a pet can only be owned/raised by a human. A human can\u2019t have a pet. 6. The lines are all in sentences but the last lines is in a rhyming couplet which rhymes with the lines in the first stanza (the first stanza is the first three lines) \n\n### 7. Lastly, the 'n' in town which is the last lines has a \"long o\" sound. And we know it's the ending line because (this is the  only clue left to us) this line must rhyme with \"own\" and \"dog\" (in the third and first lines respectively. \n\n### Thus, the answer is C.", "answer": "E: piano"}

More people are crushed to death by elephants in India than people are killed every year by venomous snake bites in India. What is the correct answer?\n\n### Explaine your reason:The correct answer would be sharks. More people are crush to deaths by elephants in Indian and sea creatures are dying more to human beings. Sharks are not venomous but their teeth are strong and are used to kill prey.

{"text": "Bible: you would read it and memorize it, but you wouldn't write it.\n### Demonstaration:\nYou would read a passage in the bible because it is a written record of what happened in the past. As you read, you are also thinking about the meaning of what you are reading. It would be very challenging to write in a bible, since it is a religious text and it is tradition for people not to write in the bible. They prefer that people read it rather than write in it.\n\nEven if someone were to put a question mark beside an unfamiliar word, some might argue, \u201cDo your own research!\u201d The reason is because you are not going to write anything down, and you want to retain your understanding without writing.

At the very least, your child will have a 1 hour break and be at the school instead of at home. You may be wondering, \u201cWhy detention over suspension?\u201d In the scenario you have provided, the child likely wants to avoid their parents finding out. At home, they are \u201cgrounded\u201d and forced to stay in the house. That is a very good reason for grounding to be a good punishment at home, but you wouldn\u2019t want the child to associate their parent with a bad punishment. You want a punishment to be a bad one, but not to associate their parent. By keeping the punishment at school, you prevent the child from making bad associations with their parent.\n\n### Input:\\# What is the last digit of the product of 4^((9-1)^-1)?\n###Response:9\n###D", "answer": "C: bible"}

These claims include 1. That democracy is more prosperous than other forms of governance, 2. That it is the safest form of governance, and 3. That it is the best form to protect people\u2019s rights. While democracy is certainly a form of governance, it isn\u2019t in anyway perfect, and there are several alternatives in which people enjoy prosperity and freedom with more guarantees than in a democracy.\n\n1. This statement is false. The author makes several claims about how much less prosperous authoritarian governments are than democracies, but the author neglects to provide a single example of how democracies are superior. The article mentions that there are more people in poverty in autocracies than democracies is not an argument for less people in poverty in democracies. This is like saying someone who got 95 in calculus can\u2019t add correctly because one of their other classmates got 100 in calculus.\n\n2. This is false. The author claims that democracies are more safe because they\u2019re more unstable, but this is false. The article goes off from the first claim and states that the chaos of a democracy is what makes it more peaceful. The article claims that \u201cWhen a democracy is shaken, its citizens have a chance to fix what\u2019s wrong,\u201d, and that democracy makes people more aware of potential chaos, both in the article. The problem with the statement however, is that the world\u2019s most successful countries are generally dictatorships, like Germany which is well known for achieving a democracy despite Hitler, China, who has had stability and high growth with a one party system and a great middle class and no human rights issues, and Japan, who also is a stable dictatorship with a middle class and has never seen a recession.\n\n3.

{"text": "The correct answer is: Engine\n\n### Instructions:Answers the question.\n\n## What are the differences between a real and a logical number?\n\n### Instuction:Answer the following question.\n\n## Examples:\n\nThe number 3 is a whole number.\n\nIn Math, a real number is a value of a set of numbers that can be either positive, negative, or zero.  \n\nOn the real number line, you have an infinite amount of numbers. You can also pick and choose, say every even number will be green and every odd number will be blue. The mathematical definition of real numbers does not specify their location or color, only their relationship.\n\n### Examples:\n\nAny whole number is a real number.\n\nThe number 9 is a real number because it\u2019s between -9 and 9.\n\nAny rational number is a real number because we can always move these numbers to the right and add zero.\n\nThe Number 1/2 is a rational number because we can move this fraction to the right and add a zero.\n\n#### Example: 0 is considered as a real number. \n\n### How to use and apply:\n\nWhen we talk about a number, you must know whether it\u2019s a whole number, a rational or an irrational number.\n\nNow, what\u2019s the difference between a rational and an irrational number? An irrational number is when the decimal value of the number will never stop. 0.333333 and 0.1234564 are both irrational numbers. \nRational numbers are when we will see the decimal value of the numbers will go. An example of irrational and rational numbers: 9 and 9/10. \n\nIn short, when you will see a decimal number and it will have an infinite amount of number in front of the decimal point. That means that decimal value will never stop.\n\n### Further Examples\n\nRational Numbers :  \n\n$\\text{3/2, 2/3}$ are Rational Numbers.\n\n$\\text{0.33, 0.12}$ are Rational Numbeers.\n\n$\\text{-124.88, -1248.3}$ are Real Numbes.", "answer": "D: engine"}

What did the developer do wrong when writing the code below?\n\nlet sum = 0;\nfor (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {\n    sum = i;\n}\n\n### Deminstration:\nHow did the developer get the sum to 1001?\n\n### Response and Explanation:\nExplanation: Answer is: The developer used array[0], instead of array[i] as the index. The 0 value is actually a reference to the first element in the array. So when it is increment in the loop it is not the value of the current array index, but the first element itself which is value 0 and so the loop never changes the reference. It simply increment the first element and the code can not change the reference in the loop. To use i as current array index change it to sum=i.\n\n### Input :The code below is written to make a function that accepts a string value, compares it to the values inside the array, and alerts the user if the compared values matches. The code is supposed to work for both strings in the array and characters in the strings. When a user inputs a string, they then check the array with the array and tell the program if the compare matches. If the compare matches, they tell the user what character inside the string is the same as the array and how many. However, the code below does not work. What is wrong with the code below?\nlet name_array = [\"a\", \"b\"];\nlet compare = name_array.toString()\n.toLocaleUpperCase();\n\nlet match = 0;\nlet a = compare.length;\nfor (let i = 0; I < a.length; i++) {\n\nlet v = compare[i];\nlet char = v.match(String.fromCharCode(0))[0];\nlet match = char;\n\nif (\ni === 0 &&\nchar[0] === \"a\" &&\nchar", "answer": "A: gain weight"}

Some of your options for dry ingredients are cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons. Use half a cup to measure one ounce. Use 1 ounce to measure one tablespoon in either dry or liquid ingredients. One teaspoon usually measures one-quarter of an ounce and one teaspoon of dry ingredients equals \u00bd teaspoon of liquid.

This is another component that is part of the **ECMAScript environment**. \n\nThe interpreter reads the code shown at line of 1 then executes it, printing the result on line 2 to the screen. Every time you run your code in the **JavaScript Console**, the interpreter executes the line of code at the very top of your work area and the rest of the code you wrote is ignored **unless** you use the **debugging console**. \n\nIn the debug console that shows up, you can type console.log(\"Hi!\");  You will see the message \"Hi!\" get printed out to the console, but that is _not_ the only thing that happens!\n\nWhen the interpreter runs the code that you see on line 1, it makes a local copy of your original code that it has stored away in a variable called \"code\". Whenever you want to evaluate some code, the interpreter will take the copy stored in \"code\" then run it just like it would if you had typed \"console.log(\"Hi!\")\" into the JavaScript Console.\n\n\n### Motion:How do you use the debugger to watch the execution of your code?\n\n### Demostration\n\n![](img/638C588A-DB87-4DD3-84A6-4FC843BC1010.png)\n\n### Motions\n\n### Instructions:\n\nYou have to answer the questions.

If there were.8 cups given to her, how many pieces of bread did she eat?\n\nAnswer: 32 3/4\n\n### Explanation:\nThe problem reads that Kris has 3.2 sandwhiches from 2.5 pieces of bread. For each sandwhich there is.5 cups left over. There are 32/4 because there is.5/4 cups left over after each sandwhich. The math is 32/4 = 8, divide the 8 by 2 because when she eats the second sandwhich she has left over 2 cups with 1 left over..4 means 4/6, which equals.8.\n\n### Response\nKrista a ate _______ sandwiches from 2.4 pieces of bread, giving her.5 cups (5/8) in the remainder. In total, she ate _______ pieces of bread.\nAnswer: 15\n\n### Response to Response:\nThere is.5 in the remainder because it says 2.4 sandwiches. Divide 5/8 to find that.4/6 which is.8 cups left.

{"text": "The correct answer that answers the question provided in part A is the parking lot near an amusement park. Based on the parking lot near amusement parks are found in urban areas. Farmers or tradesmen don't need to park their car near a roller coats.  In case, business districts are found in urban areas so the parking lot can be found there as well. The choice is inaccessible, while car parking lots located in urban districts.  Lastly, in the options are roller coasters are in rural areas that would explain why they are usually inaccessible. \n\n### Input answer:B\n\n### Explanation:\nBusiness districts are usually in urban areas where there's likely to be a roller coaster or an amusement park. Business districts are usually only surrounded by residential areas, which make it more accessible which would make it likely a business district would be next to a roller coaster. A carpark is an area where people could park and travel freely so that doesn't satisfy the given statement, amusement parks don't have farms, a farm is used for growing crops not for operating rides so amusement park won't be in rural areas, in an amusement park that usually have a lot of tourists and people so it is unlikely that people can get to these locations easily. It is more likely that they are located in the city, and if the statement provided has a mention of rides then the parking lot should be next to a farm.\n\n### Inputanswer:C\n\n### Explantation:\nThe options would be in business districts and carparks that are found in urban areas, but an amusement park, which is in a more populated place than a carpark, also exists there. Business districts are usually in cities so they would have amusement park attractions, but a business district is more likely to be in a metropolitan area than an amusement park. The carpark would have to be in an area that is easily accessible to people since they are not looking for parking near a farm, and not near a ride that people would be likely to miss. There's a chance that the choice could be an amusement park's parking lot, but it'd be more likely in an urban district since there's probably a place for people to park next to where they can ride.", "answer": "D: amusement park"}

In this scenario for me, I am not being assisted by my parents as I would have been until a certain maturity age, so I would probably prefer that schools offered a homework support program because it would allow parents the opportunity to do their other tasks that they have to do such as getting groceries, and I am the only one in my family who helps with groceries so if I can go to a place for help, it would lessen my parents stress of having to assist me with my homework.

But you do not charge it 2% at a time, because 83% of your battery would last 2 hours longer and you would not need to charge it for 108 extra minutes. How many extra minutes do you need to charge you phone?\n\n**Solution:** You need to charge your phone for 1 hour and you want to have 83% of the battery because that is what will last 2 extra hours.\n\n83% of your phone battery = 114% of your phone battery + 108% of your phone battery\n\n114% of you phone battery is 1.14 times 83% = 92.12% of you phone battery\n\n108% of you phone battery equals 1.08 times 83% equals 88.92% of your phone battery.\n\n92.12 + 88.9 = 181.02% of your phone\u2019s battery needs to stay for 2 hours.\n\nWe need 181.9% of your phone\u2019S battery for 2 hours.

{"text": "B\n\nInput:C is the correct answer, because a human can't sit in bathrooms since they are designed for only short visits. The same goes with the airport and other transportation places which are only meant to be temporary. Also, humans wouldn't sit in the bathroom for the reason the human poops and pees. But the human wouldn't be able to poop and pee in space, so this can't be an option. The only place a human can sit for an extended period of time would probably be something like a coffee shop or a restaurant. Coffee shops are designed for longer visits than other places like the airport since coffee shops allow you to get food instead of just a drink. Restaurants would be similar in that it would be easier to sit somewhere in a cafe to eat food.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is B. There is a slight bias in the statement. The human sat in the bathroom for extended periods and it wasn't good for them, but they didn't specify which human they were referencing. This means that this problem could be talking about any human but most likely is referring to a single person.\n\n### Input\n:How many candies will be in the jar if Ali started out with 600?\n\n### Response\n:Since she used 300 candies for the birdhouses the rest remaining would be 600 minus 300.

You have to take the amount of seconds and divide it by a year and then multiply by months to see how much money is spent on the phone bill.\n\n### Question :How do you do a question like this where you get 150,742 students in an auditorium with 100% capacity, and then subtract how many students didn\u2019t show up? Choices:  Multiply the two. Have students count their attendences and subtract. Divide the capacity by the number of the students. Subtract 1.\n\n### Answer:\n\nMultiply the two\n\n### Explantion:\n\nHere the answer is \"Multiply the two\". In the problem, we multiply the amount of students who arrived by the amount of students who were in the room. This means that you can solve the problem by the following formula: (Number1 x Number2) - 1. Number1 and Number2 are both the amount of students that arrived. -1 is in the formula because \"1 student didn't arrive\"\n\n### Question:What is the answer to the problem \"I saw a number that was one less than two times 7", "answer": "B: respond"}

{"text": "#### The answer is:\n\nE. The garage.\nA folding chair is too big to fit on the roof, in the closet, or above the table, so you would leave it at the school or the beach if you do not have any doors there.\n\n#### The explanation is:\n\nYou can place a folding chair on your roof so you can watch other people below. However, this will be too inconvenient if you live in an apartment with a roof access. You cannot place more than one chair on the roof, so you cannot put a group of chairs there.\n\nIf you do not have a school or a beach near you, the easiest place to put the chairs is on your roof. You cannot put it on the ground with a group of chairs. Putting the chairs on the ground is too inconvenient, so you cannot leave folding chairs outside your house every day.\n\nA closet or a small room has high walls and a door, which makes it inaccessible for chairs and small people alike. The chairs are way more bulky than just a coat or two, so you will not want to store them in your closet.\n\nThe size of the garage is so variable that you cannot put a chair there if you do not want to use it anymore. The size of the garage does not just depend on whether you own a car, and not everyone who owns a car has a garage that is large enough for a chair.\n\n#### The reasons are:\n\nYou can have folding chairs on your roof, but you cannot have more than one. The chairs are too large to put them all on your roof so you cannot have a group of chairs on the roof, even though they were made to be folded.\n\nYou can keep folding chairs in your closet or a small space. However, the chairs are extremely large for a small space, so it will be too inconveniant to put more than one chair in these spaces.\n\nThe size for the garage varies dramatically, so if you want to keep a folding chair there you have to make sure the garage is big enough for it. The space in your garage does not depend on whether you own car, so it is not enough just to own a car to put a bunch of chairs in your garage.", "answer": "D: closet"}

{"text": "The correct answer is A: *shame*\n\nIn the United States, it is a crime to lie under oath, or \"commit perjury\". Under the law, perjury is legally defined as \"willfully testifying falsely under oath or penalty of perjury.\" Perjury may also be proven by omission, in instances where a witness, with intent to deceive, fails to mention an important fact in a trial.\n\nA criminal prosecution under federal or state perjury laws is rare. Federal prosecutors only proceed against a few dozens defendants each year in cases involving taxation or a range of other activities that fall under federal jurisdiction. Those state courts that are open to the general public can prosecute perjury, although in many states the crime is a misdemeanor, and even many felony prosecutions are rare. In jurisdictions where there is little prosecution of perjury, such as Alaska, the risk of being criminally prosecuted under perjury laws is seen as being so remote that few people are deterred from falsifying testimony. Some federal magistrates have declared prosecutions in cases involving low level crimes to be frivolous, and are therefore prohibited by Rule 11 of the Judicial Code.[3] This rule is typically used to prevent prosecution of per se perjury when it is clear when a defendant is lying even without a lie detector or other scientific evidence that is otherwise used for that purpose.

The difference between the two, however, was only two less. A contestant also said she wanted to be a police officer one of these days while another said she wanted to be an astronaut. They were also asked if they believed in witchcraft or not and the results varied. The first contestant replied that her grandmother used to be a herbalist but denied being a witch while the other responded that it depended on how you defined witchcraft. Finally, the two were asked to write their thoughts on a paper. One said that she believed in love and the other said she wanted to be with the one she loves.

{"text": "Answer:A\n\n### Rationale:If the ground is getting wet, solidifying is a possibility. The ground is heated up, which causes a shift in the substance of the ground from gas to solid, therefore the ground can solidify. Answer:B\n\n### Input\"Renato is doing an experiment with electricity. At the beginning of the experiment, a voltmeter shows 24 volts, but at the end, 1 volt voltage changes. After the experiment, he realized that he is missing one wire with the polarity of - (-), and he found it in 5 minutes. During the experiment what did you see in the voltmeter and for how many minutes did Renato search for the missing wire?\n\n\n\nGiven the task, there should be only one wire missing with the polarity of (-) because if there is only one wire missing with this polarity, we can't find it just by searching for anything. I think that \"Renato is doing...\" does not mean there is already something. He is doing an experiment, not an activity that has already happened. After the experiment, I did not expect to see any different voltage because 24 volts can still be 23 volts and I think that it is still safe then. We only consider only if he is already missing for the time I mentioned: 5 minutes. He was searching for 5 minutes because there is none in the experiment when he is already missing one, and he lost 5 minutes and still looking for it. So it is logical that he still searches for it and loses 5 minutes in the total experiment. There was only one wire in the experiment.\n\n\n### Input \n\n\n### Response\n\n### Input\n\n### Response", "answer": "B: melting"}

{"text": "B\n\n###  Detailed Explanation:\n\n### 1. Answers: T, F.\n\n### 2. What do you notice?\n\n### What do you notice about the table? \n\n### 3. Answers: T.\n\n### A. We will be working with two new types of numbers: variables and expressions. A variable is shown by a letter or symbol such as X, Y or Z. An expression refers to a set of numbers put together using mathematical operations.\n\n### For example, 4 + 6 tells us to add the number 4 to the number 6. X \u2013 4 tells us to do X minus 4. X * 6 tells us to multiply X by 6. Dividing 10 by 2 tells us to find the quotient (answer) of 10 divided by 2. Exponents are mathematical words that show how many times to do the operations on the number they refer to. For example, if X = 2^3, we multiply X by itself 3 times.\n\n### There are some standard rules about what to write. For instance, when multiplying two expressions, the order of operations has to be applied. In the expression 4 * (X * (4-Y)) the multiplication comes first in which case the answer is 4 * (X-(4-Y)). The division also follows the normal rules as the multiplication and the order of operations comes after that.\n\n### B. When we write expressions we can always use parentheses \u2013 or brackets \u2013 to make sure operations take place in the correct order, and not left to right. You can create brackets any way you want \u2013 with numbers, with symbols or with words, even.\n\n### Brackets can go inside or outside a set of numbers, and they can also be used to separate parts of the expression inside. For example, the expressions 6 + (8 + 2) 4-3 5 * (5-2)^2 can all be written 6 + (8+2) 4- 3 5 *((5-2)^2).\n\n\n\n### 4. Answers: T\n\n### Detailed Explanation\n\n### C.

The third pile of money contains coins ranging from 1\u00a2 to $1 in value.\n\nWhen you receive your money, you can convert any $100 bills to a third pile of money composed entirely of coins (the coins don't have to be $1 coins).  For example, if you have $200 in $100 bags, you could convert them and find you now actually have a second pile of money worth $120 in bills.\n\nAny time you receive a bill pile, you must convert them to a coin pile if they meet the requirements of your conversion rule.  \n\nYou will receive bills of differing denominations.  You can only send these bills to the bank if they satisfy the following rule: if the total value of the bills (in coins) you must receive in exchange equals or exceeds the total value of the bill pile", "answer": "D: acute angled"}

{"text": "D\n#### Explanation: \"A,\" is not the correct answer. \"A\", the incorrect answer, is the only option which is not an appropriate response for a task like this. A task like this is usually a response that a task might create. Therefore, \"A,\" is not an appropriate response to the provided task.\n\n### Input:\"A\" \n\n### Explanation: This task is a little too open ended. It would be difficult to write a response to that task given the little information that is given to us. Usually, a task would include some information to help answer the question. That's why we gave a question like \"What is a monster?\". A response like \"Monsters are not real.\" Is unacceptable because we provided no data to prove or disprove whether they are real or not. Furthermore, the way the question is phrased is to see if you understand the concept of \"a possible response to a task\". If a response didn't fit in this example, it didn't fit. As a simple response to a task, it would be better to choose something that fits or doesn't.\n\n### Answer:\"B\"\n\n### Exlplanation: \"B\", the correct answer, is a suitable response for this task. A response like \"A\" is unsuitable because of the lack of information that is given to support it. A task is usually to give you as much information as possible to work with it. Therefore, a response should at least make the task acceptable.\n\n### Examples of the task: \n\n### Invention:\nWrite an equation for the relationship in the next figure. \n\n### Picture 1: \n\n## Input:\nWrite all the possible expressions from which you can subtract 64 and get 9?\n\n### Demostration:\nExpressions to subtract 64 and receive number 9\n\n1. 53  \u2013 9\n2. 35  \u2013 25\n3. 18  \u2013 27\n4. 22  \u2013 25 \n\n### Answer:\n(35  \u2013 64) \u2013 25\n\n### Instructions:\nWrite an equation describing the figure you see. \n\n## Input Picture:\n\n### Demosition:\nDescription", "answer": "C: mass hysteria"}

{"text": "There are many more answers to this but they all share common properties (that we are not expecting to be able to see since it requires a math or advanced skill)\n\n### Justification:There has to be an expression to find how much traffic is there for this. It seems unlikely that 322 people traveling from a city A to a city B would cause the speed from a road to be slower than someone traveling from a city B to a city C. It seems unlikely that the speed would not decrease the further it goes from a certain type of location that could be a rest stop, a city where you travel to often, or any other city A that you travel to. This implies, logically, that the speed would get slower the closer it gets to a city A because the less people are driving to the city. It seems unlikely that they are driving, for example, from a city A to America since America is the country they are driving to, so they would have to be driving at least 1/2 to America as well as many other cities to make it to America.\n\n### Additional Questions:\nIf all cities were as close as the ones given, how many drivers would be on the expressway and what percentage of total drivers would be on the particular expressway?\n\nWhy will not the speed increase the closer the driver gets to a city?\n\nIs the speed dependent upon other factors as well such as the time of day?\n\nTo find the speed from a city to itself.", "answer": "C: american city"}

{"text": "C\n\n### Explanation:\nIt would seem obvious that an apple farmer in Ohio has to bring his apples to a commercial orchard in a large city like San Francisco or New York City, where they can be purchased by the consumer.\n\nIf we just look at the states that neighbor Ohio, only apples grown in Michigan would be considered \u201cimported\u201d. However, this is not the case. Though apples in other states are less likely to be considered imported, there are other considerations to take into account.\n\nA: Ohio does not border the US with the same status that the surrounding states have. This makes it difficult to consider Ohio apples as imported.\n\nB: Apples grown in Washington State would be imported regardless of neighboring Washington and Oregon. Since Washington is located across the continent, it is considered outside the US mainstream and outside this category.\n\nC: Apples grown in Alaska and apples grown in Canada cannot enter the United States without being inspected for quality and disease.\n\nD: Apples farmed in Canada may eventually make their way to the USA after passing these strict quality checks. However, this makes apples from Canada and from Alaska different in classification. Canadian apples are not considered \u201cimported\u201d.\n\nE: Apples grown in farms in Canada and Alaska are not considered imported even if they are brought to a city or town located in the USA as most grocery items not produced in a different state are.\n\nSo, a product from an apple tree in Ohio would be considered imported but not apples from apple trees located in the state of Michigan\n\n### Input\"How long would it take to drive from Sacramento to Las Vegas?\"\n\n### Response\"It would take 6 hours.

{"text": "C\n\n### Input\nWe asked our students to take a practice test in math to determine whether to recommend remedial or regular math. If a student finished a practice test in less than 16 minutes, we recommend regular. We found that most students scored above 80% on the test in less than 20 minutes, and we hope to make the recommendation more accurate. You have been tasked with making the recommendation based upon a new sample by using data collected from 475 students. If a student took more than 20 minutes to finish the test, we recommend their parents to contact a math tutor for free. Write a script for Python that makes the recommendation using the data collected.\n\n### Response\nWe will need to collect the time that a student took to complete the test in addition to the score the students got. We can then iterate over the data and find the median by using the function np.arange which gives us a list of array values that start at 0 and end at 99. Then we can use len, or length, to take the len of our list of times and find out the median time to complete the test. If a student took longer than the median time, then we can continue iterating to get the medians of each of the individual values to determine when to give the student the recommendation to contact a math tute. By doing this, we can give a more accurate time that a student needs for the test, which will better inform which student receives this recommendation.\n\n### Input - Problem with sample data\n\nWe asked our students that they could complete their math test (472 total). We collected all the scores for the students and the times they took to complete the exam. We have found that the distribution of times differs across the scores, specifically the high and low scorers. It was observed that the high and low scorer had times that were twice as long as the majority of students and we wish to find what score this might be. Use the data collected, and write a script for python that solves the problem.\n\n### Solution\nWe can iterate over in order to determine the median. We then need to iterate again over the array to identify what score is the median. By doing this, I can find the scores of the high and low scoores.\n\n### Soliciting Feedback\nWe asked our students who used the new recommendation system. We", "answer": "B: rejection"}

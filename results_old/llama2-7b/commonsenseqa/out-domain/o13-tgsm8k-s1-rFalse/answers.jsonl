It's height is 14 inches and the base has an area of 20 sqft. Find the surface area.\n\n### Response;\nThere are two formulas that I can use, the first being A=pi*r^2 and the second A=2*pi*r^2. Since the radius is 9(4 inches times pi is 12.56) and the height is 14 (inches), what I would do is 13*pi*pi then I would square root it.

Two of them are correct.\n\n### Technique 1\nThe second technique was to use the distance formula. I took the given x value of 2 and I wanted to find y.

If the batter swings successfully, the ball may be a foul ball, a fair ball, or a home run, depending on which of the following apply:\n*If the ball is foul, it misses both the foul pole and the infield, and does not pass through the outfield\n*If the ball lands on the outfield fair side of the foul pole, it is an out\n*If the ball does not reach either base and is caught by a fielder, it is an out.\n\nIf no fielder catches the ball, it is a home run\nThe game starts with 4 balls. There are 6 innings. Each player gets 3 strikes. After five pitches, the first batter is not allowed an additional strike. For each successful swing, the batter gets to go to the plate again.\n\nWhat is the probability of an at bat in the first inning and the third inning ending with a home run?", "answer": "C: meeting"}

{"text": "Answers: C  D  E \n\n### Instructions:\nEach question in this activity comes in two forms. The original question has been left in intact in the box to the right. The response is below the question. Both are in sentence form. The format of the response is to write the request in complete or accurate sentences as written in the original question. Write your response, in complete or accurate sentences, below the request. For example, if the original request was: \"What is 100 less than 125?\" The response should be \"What is 1\" and so on. Use appropriate upper case and lower case letters as indicated in the original question. There are no rules on punctuation or spelling. A correctly written response will give the desired result; an incorrect answer (wrong response) may be accepted but may also be denied.\n\n### Recommendation:\nFor extra points, you may wish to add notes on how you reached your solution. You may not use notes or extra spaces in a way that will change the response of the program. This is in addition to using the 300-character limit. Do not add any spaces, extra capital letters or punctuation to the response, nor underline, italicize, circle or otherwise encircle/underline the request in your response.\n\n---\n\n### Instructor Guideline:\nBe sure to thoroughly review the student responses before giving the correct answer and a grade. Students sometimes get the correct answer, but use words that do not conform to the exact wording of the instructions. In other words, a question may say, \"What is 20 less than 10?\" and the response does not use \"20 less\", or the response may omit the \"than\" in \"20 less than...\" and so on. In this case, it is the format, not the answer that is considered incorrect. Grades will be given on the basis of correct answers; however, students will be advised about the need to use the correct wording and not in the proper format, unless the response does not fall under the wording or the format of the instructions.\n\n---", "answer": "A: drugstore"}

I always have to count how many choices do they give and how many times they used that question. This one was harder for me to count through because not too many choices and the question was all numbers and I am terrible with numbers but I did ok and I didn\u2019t turn it in late but it took me extra work but I did it.\n\n## Teacher Comments:\nThis student is learning about making connections and it was evident by their responses when they included information that had to do with what they were already learning and other subjects they already knew.

{"text": "The answer is choice B\n\n### Inputs:Alice is running and has to pass through a maze. At each intersection, the options available to her alternate. The maze consists of 310 intersections. If on each turn, Alice chooses the option which takes her longer in the least, how long will it take her to get through the maze, assuming that she begins on her first turn?\n\n### Response\n\nThe answer is option D\n\n### Input \nAlice is running and is being chased. She sees a building with two doors and enters one. From there, the two doors lead to an intersection, which has four options. If Alice takes her first turn, it is the same as choice D. From there Alice may take her next turn from the three options at the intersection. The next intersection then has five options. If Alice takes this first turn, her options will be the same as in the third scenario. Her second turn comes from choices A to C. She can then choose either C to D or A or E.\n\n### Response \n\nAlice will take the second option in scenario 1. However, in scenarios 2 and 3, she will take the second option. In each scenario, Alice takes the shortest route to the intersection with two doors. Then it is the same as scenario 1. Scenario 1 takes a little longer than the others because Alice travels the longest distances to the intersection in Scenario 1 and thus takes more turns.\n\n### Input\nAlice is running in a forest and is on a path that runs at a right angle to the river. However, the river turns abruptly 100 meters further. At this point, Alice crosses the river and walks 100 meters across grass. He walks again through the forest as it curves to his left. After a certain number of kilometers, Alice approaches a village. She is not sure if the village is still 5 kilometers away or if she has already passed it. At this point, a wolf attacks her and pushes Alice toward the village. Alice is 3.5 meters tall.

This is an array problem. This is what I did in this step.\n\nIn this task, the solution was to determine the number that the plane seat has and the problem was to determine the number on the plane:\nMy solutions were to know that it\u2019s going to be 180 seats and we are going to find it using 4 arrays because each seat can accommodate for how many travelers.\nThe problem is that no one will have 5 travelers on their seat, so the first array will have 180/5=36.\nNow, we have one solution to the problem and it\u2019s not enough, we need another. So, in this one we put the amount of seats (4) divided by the number of seats in another 180-0=180. And we get the same amount as the first one, so we add them together and we get 72 + 72 = 144.

Three fifths of them are boys (\ud835\udc49={50, 20}). How many of the\nchildren are girls (\ud835\udc4f={})?\n\n### Demystified: \n\nThis task first tells you about two groups of students. The first group is a group of the whole party and it has 50 students (\ud835\udc49=50). The group second is boys group (\ud835\udc49.3) which means three fifth of the whole party is boys (\ud835\udc46.3=20 students) and the part second is boys.

If they sell biscuits 3 times per day, how many dozen will they use to make biscuits?\n\n### ResponseC\n\n### Demystification:\nIf each pair sells 24 cookies and each day (3 times / day) they make 90 biscuits, each day (of each pair selling) they make 258 biscuits. So they use up to 58 dozen for each day, which means 116 dozen a day. So they use 150 dozen in total. This isn't necessarily what it takes to calculate exactly how many dozen, but it tells you a way to think about each pair of these pairs to see how you get to using 150 dozens and how you can solve the problem without calculating. It's really a problem about making sure that this is a divisible number of 150 dozes.\n\nThis also tells you the number of days that baking takes. There are 150 dozen to begin with that they have, then they are using 2/3 of that, which is 50 at each day. 3 times (for each day) is 105, so I know that the number of days it takes includes 105, which includes 4 days.", "answer": "C: bible"}

What distance will it travel in 4 hours?\n\n### Response\n  `4,7179`\n\n### Instructions\nIf you want to find how far a plane travels,  you need to multiply its speed by the time it travels for.\nSo, in the question above, you must multiply 15,024 by 4 to get the answer, but you have to put 15,042 as the units of distance so you will not forget to type in the right number of units and the answer is 60,096\n\n### Instructor:\nA plane is flying...\n\nIf you are doing an arithmetic operation on a unit, you can use the `*` key with no spaces between for multiplication. For example, if you want to multiply two numbers, you can type this: `6772* 36`.\n\n### Instutor:\nA plane is f...\n\n### Instution:\nThe `*` key is not necessary when doing arithmetic operations. For example, if the numbers are only two digits like in this sample, for multiplication you can simply type them with no space between for example `677236`.\n\nIf you are typing a number with thousands and millions, you can use the `%` key where it will not have any spaces before or after it and it will get the right answer. For example, if your typing a number like `527.82` it will result to `5,278.20` because the `.` key after the point (the decimal point) is a space so what you will get if you only type it as `.82` is `5.28`.\n\n### Example:\nA boy has collected 4,392 pokemon cards and his friend has collected 2,990.\nHow many do they have in all?\n\n### Answer:\nTotal cards collected = `4392 + 2990` = 7382\n\n### Instuctor:\nA boy has collect...\n\n`4992 + 2,998` is not the answer to the question because you are only supposed to type", "answer": "C: being found out"}

What is the area of the shoe?\n\nNote: The area of a rectangle is simply length times width. The area of a triangle is 1/2 of the base multiplied by the height of the triangle. The area of a circle is pi times the radius squared. So the area of a circle is the square of pi times the radius. This means that the area of a circle can be represented as pi * r squared.

{"text": "### Input;\nI have a friend who is a chef in a restaurant. The restaurant is quite famous for its quality of food, and every food it serves is quite delicious for those who love to eat a lot. My friend knows that I like food as well, and he often shares the menu of the week with me and allows me to come there and order food from the restaurant. So, this week, my friend sent me a menu and told me to order whatever I like. I was looking at the menu and decided that I would like to order the tastiest dishes in that menu. So, I quickly wrote a text and send it to my friend. I will give a message to him so that he can arrange things in my favor. The message I gave:\n\nHello, Friend!\n\nThis is me. I am quite excited about food I can order at your restaurant today. So, I will order the foods I like, but I don;t want to over-consume, because I am not sure how many calories every dish will contain. So, I will not eat all those dishes with 1000 calories, but 800 calories less. For example, you know that your restaurant is famous for serving the best French fries. You say they are prepared with healthy oil and are quite tasty and delicious. They contain no preservatives as well. But I also know that if I eat 3 French fries, they will contain 146 calories. Now, if I want to eat 9 French fries, I will have to consume 1310 calories. So, I will consume only 800 calorie worth of French fries. In this way, I will eat 800 calore French fries, 700 calories worth of sandwich, 600 calories worth and 500 calories worth. So, I will eat altogether, 3150 calories, which is 700 calorie less than what I desire. What do you think if my desire of eating 3150 is quite appropriate? If you want me to eat 3200 calorie or more, you can change what you would have cooked for me. If it is not a problem for you, this plan suits me well.

Thus, the options, \"C\", \"B\", \"A\" and \"E\" should all\nbe eliminated.\n\n\"Record store\" is a great option, as we don't often buy records at\n\"record albums\", for example.\n\n\"Record albums\" is also a great option, as I rarely buy LPs at\n\"record store\".\n\nSimilarly, \"Safeway\" and \"D\" should be eliminated because these\nwords aren't appropriate nouns. I can't buy \"wallpaper\" at\n\"safeway\" or vinyl at \"D\".\n\n### Hints that are likely wrong:\nThe only obvious possibility I can come up with is A, due to the\n\"E\" (though that abbreviation doesn't make much sense). It's just a\nwaste of an \"E\" and has no other significance. The same could be said\nabout \"C\" and \"B\".\n\n\"D\" is clearly not possible, as \"vinyl\" are not generally sold at\n\"safes\".\n\n### Input and Explanation:The most commonly found color in a rainbow is violet.

Make sure you check on the syntax errors, indentation errors, and spelling errors. Remember, the only capital letters in Python are when we\u2019re declaring a variable.\n\n###  **Writing a Correct Program**\nWhen writing Python programs, it is important to think carefully about the meaning of the instructions. Python can't \"understand\" what the computer code you write is supposed to do unless it is clearly written. It's crucial to proofread the code in order to produce the desired output.\n\n### Guidelines (For Instructions):\n\u2022 Use indentation to organize and format your code\nUse 4 spaces to indicate indentation. \n\u2022 Use lowercase letters for commands and variables\nUse the ```$``` symbol at the beginning of each line.\n\u2022 Use proper syntax throughout your program\nEach command on any line of code should follow proper syntax. \n\u2022 Follow the instructions from the previous problem\nIn the following problems and on the quiz you will need to follow the instructions to the letter. If you do not follow the directions precisely, your score will be penalized.\n\u2022 Do not copy and paste commands from the computer directly into your code\nDo not copy and paste commands word for word from the computer into your code.  Each computer has a slightly different set of commands. Try to write your commands independently rather than copying and pasting.\n### Exam Instructions\nTo create new problems you can use ```create_problem``` command and to evaluate a given problem from the dataset use ```evaluate_problem``` command. For example, ```create_problem(num_questions=5)``` would create a new problem, with 5 questions, which can be used for evaluation purpose using ```evaluate_problem(problem_id)```.\nYou", "answer": "D: being bored"}

She had 57 left.\n\n### Input\nZach is saving his money to but a bike that cost $100. His weekly allowance cost $5. His parent will give him an extra $1,00 to mow the law. He'll be making $7 per hour after he mowes the law. Zach has $65. What can Zach do more with?\n\n### Solution\nIf Zach had $7 per hour, it would take $10 hours to earn $70. He would have to earn $30 by mowing the law.\n\n### Explanation:\nZach is already earning $5 per week plus his parent will give him an income of $10. So he's earning $5 + $10 = $15 per week.\n\n### If he can make $70 in 10 hours, he can earn the difference in 20 hours.\n\n### So to earn the $30 he's going to have to work for 7 hours with it paying him $4.29 (The extra $15 per week earnt). He needs a total of $70. He already made $60. So all he needs to make is $10.\n\n### And with that logic he needs x hours to earn $10.

In 16 hours, Ryan was 6 times older and Kari was 5 times younger than Ryan. How long are they in hours? (1728 - 169)\nAnswer: 230\nRyan was 48 years old, so Ryan was 6 times as old as Kari was. Kari was 25 so she was 5 times as young as Ryan was. After the 16 hours, I don't think we know how Kari was.\n\nNow we know that if you're 6 times as old, subtract 6 and you get an even number. The same for a multiple that's the same amount smaller.\n\nSo we know that if you add 6 to 5 and get a number, that number is younger than Kari. So to find the answer, we have to solve for Kari's age as a function of time.\n\nLet t = age\n\nK is 5 t younger = 5t - t\n\nAt 16 hours, R is 6 t + 6 = 12 t\n\nK is 6 t - t + t (remember, -6 + t - r)\n\nSo K = 1 less than: (t - 6)/5 = t - 12/5\n\nThis is only 230, and we know it'", "answer": "A: health club"}

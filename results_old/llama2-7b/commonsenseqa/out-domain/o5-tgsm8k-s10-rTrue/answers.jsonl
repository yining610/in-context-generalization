{"text": "The correct answer is C\n\n### Input :  What is the greatest common factor(GCF) of 75 and 863?\n\n### Response :  The GCF(Greatest Common Factor) of 75 & 863 is 17\n### Rationale:  We have to factorize the numbers in order to find their GCF, in order to factorize we divide with the largest factor till we get the prime or primes (prime numbers can be factored by 1 only so they do not divide), Lets say that the factors of 75 or 863 are 1,3,9,23 and 65 or 1,53 respectively. Then only factors of LCM(Least Common multiple)=Product of all the factors of both the numbers we are factoring, LCM= Product of all the factors =75 * 863 or 75 *5^2 * 2^3 =51875, if we divide 51875 with the LCM we get GCF.\n\n### Input \n\nFactorize (42^2-38^2)\n\n### Rationale :\n\nFactorize is similar to factoring a number means to divide in its common factors.\n\n\n### Answer :\n\nGCF =4.

The cat is old and sick. Then it dies but gets resuscitated.  It lives four more days.  How many lives does it have after it has lived four days?\nRationales I know, there are 7 lives (or 8 lives) in the sentence, but they only count from zero.  We know the cat has 7 lives, but she has to lose one each time she dies.  Here is how it works:\n  * The first time it dies, it's life nr. 7.\n  * The cat does not die right away.  We assume that she survived the first time it died, which is why we're saying that 'it' has 7 lives after it has lived 3 days.\n  * The second time it dies, it loses its life nr. 8 (if it had lost its life nr 8 the question would be: what if the cat has lost all eight lives?  Is it still alive?  The question is answered in section II.A below).\n  * The third and fourth time it dies, it lose its lives on nr. 9 and 10.\n  * So the question is:  How many lives does she have left after it has lived three days?\nThere are 7 lives (7*3=21) days  and it still had 5 lives left.  21, with the first day not counted.

They never foresaw the hard time they would face and how much work would be needed to build homes and find food. But, they did succeed, and we have their stories today. The story of the Mayflower is one of the most famous tales. The Mayflower was the name of the ship, and the year was 1620. The story was called the Mayflower.  \nAs winter soon approached, the Puritans came up with the idea of the Mayflower. The Mayflower started out in England with 102 men, women, and children on board. On November 9, 1620, the Mayflower landed on the shore of Cape Cod in Massachusetts. It was November 9, and the harsh weather forced them to settle. They built the homes, but the cold weather was unbearable. They needed to figure out how to stay alive. They soon found out that beaver skins kept them cold.  \nThey knew they had to find food. Soon, they tried fishing, and catching ducks. And soon, they found beaver. After a while, they soon found out that the beaver pelts could keep them warmer during the worst winters.\n\nThe passage describes what?\n\n#### The Mayflower\nAnswer: the first ship that came to America and brought the first settlers was called the Mayflowers\n\n#### winter\nAnswer: The winter is known to be the coldest as the temperatures drop\n\n#### ducks\nAnswer: A type of bird\n\n#### Harsh Weather\nAnswer: The Weather was at its worst\n\n#### to find food\nAnswer: they searched for food to get it in the worst and coldest weather condition\n\n#### to stay alive\nAnswer: in", "answer": "E: get food"}

In addition to apples, I have peaches in the first bag, and bananas in the other four bags. There are 8 peaches in the first and 10 bananas in the other bags. If I take one fruit from each bag, how many peaches will I end up with?\"\n\n### Rationales: One of the items in each bag must be the same.  There are only three possibilities: one bag has bananas and apples, while the other has peaches and apples; one bag has apple, peaches, and bananas, while the other has all banana and apples; or both bags have peaches, apples, and bananas.\nLet's analyze each possibility.\n\n#### Analysis 1:\nOne bag must have bananas and apples.  The other bag must have only apples and peaches, because bananas and peaches cannot coexist in the same bag.\nIf we take one item f rom each bag, all things being equal, the item from the banana-only bag will be banana, while the item from the other bag will be peach.\nSince bananas and peaches are in different bags, no other fruit is available. So if we take one item from each bag, we have no other choice but peach and banana.\n### Analysis 2:\nOne bag must contain both bananas and apples; the other must contain only peaches and apples.\nIf we take only one item from each bag and we only know that those fruits are present in those bags, there are four fruits to choose from for each bag (bananas, peaches, apples and, of course, the fruits unknown by the giver):\nIf we take one from each bag, the probability of having:\nPeanut-corn-peach-orange-cherry-apple-apple-pe", "answer": "B: big house"}

{"text": "The UK has a few roads that have been branded with the term motorway, yet there is only one major road in America that is known as a motorway.\n\n### In the United States, a motorway is often known as a highway. Even on the main sites that provide US highway maps, such as Wikipedia and the US Federal Highway Administration, a map indicates that there is one motorway in the United States. This is known as the NYS Thruway, which is called an expressway by the US Department of Transportation.\n\n### However, the European Motorway Code and other European Union documents, as well as most Europeans, would not consider the term motorway to refer to this US road.\n\n### Why? A highway is the most commonly-used term for a major road in the United States. It is used synonymously with motorway, and has its base in a French word that means way, highway or track.\n\n### A motorway is also commonly used in Europe, but the US does not often use that term. Even as US highways transition to the use of tolls to finance their upkeep and increase in traffic, it has not changed the terminology yet.\n\n### When discussing roads worldwide, the most accepted terminology will be to use specific national terminology.  The term motorway is a British term commonly used to refer to major roads, whereas highway, interstate, route, or expressway are more acceptable terms to use in the US.  In the meantime, you would be unlikely to meet American driving instructors or travel experts using the term motorway in their advice or recommendations, although they may use it in conversation if asked.\n\n### The US uses the term interstate to refer to some roads (see [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_of_U.S._interstate_highways)).\n\n### Choice A: Scotland\n#### Scotland has some roads that are referred to as motorways, but not as main arteries of transportation.\n\n##  Task Analysis:\nInput: A pizza costs $25 at one restaurant and $12 at another.

Choices I: three years\nII: three months\nIII: a short amount of time\n\n### Response - multiple choice: answer choices are I and II\n\n### Rationale for answer choice I: \nThe first sentence said you would have $3.5 billion which means the question is asking how long the 3.5 billion would last. Given this information, it would take 3.5 billion / 1 billion = 3.5 years to spend $1 billion.\n\n### RATIONALES FOR ANSWER CHOICE II:\nThe sentence \"If you had $3.6 billion...\" contradicts the information in the first sentence which said that you had $3.4 billion, so you don't have $3.6 billion. You can't be asked how long $3.6 billion would last given the fact that you already said you had $3.1 billion and $3.1 billion is not $3.6 billion, so it doesn't make sense why the question is saying you had 3.6 billion. Additionally, in the first sentence they state that you had $370 million and it doesn't make logical sense for you to have $3.6 with this much of a change so your current earnings are not taken into consideration.\n\n### Inspired By\nhttps://www.sentry.io/coding-test-interview-questions-and-exercises/?ref=gtr", "answer": "D: michigan"}

If length of the rectangle is l and width is w, then the formula is l=2*w + l*w = 2w + l = l(1 + 2w/l) w => l(2w) = 2 w + l 2w = l - l l(2w) - l = 2w = w If the area of a rectangle = 25 sq m, then its perimeter must be 25 sq m/(l-l)/ = 25/l We know l = 2w + w (length and width are the same) 2 w + w = l 3w = l We know that length of rectangle is l = 3w + w = w + 2w = 2 w = 25/3 w = 25/(2) w = 30 sq m If l = 30sq ms, then width is 10 sq m.\n\n### Solution 2::\n\nLet the length and width of rectangle be respectively l and w.\n\nWe know that l + w = 2(l + w) or w = 2l or w = l2\n\nThen l +w = 2(l+ l2) + w = 2l2 => l2 = l 2 => l = l2.

She needs 0.35 kg of kidney beans per person. There will be 8 people at the party, and everyone will have 5 servings of chili.  How many kg of kidney beas does Isabella need to make the chili?\n\nIsabella has 455 g of kidney beans in her kitchen, including 29 g that go to waste. How many kg of kidnel beans does she have left to make the chili and still have 426 g remaining that can be eaten in any other way?\n\nRationales: First, she needs 3500*0.35 = <<3500*10/100 = 35/3>>35/3 servings per person.\nAs everyone will have 5 * 35/3 = <<5*35/3=50/3>>50/3 servings per portion, there are a total of 50 servings per person.  There are a total of 10 people as 5*8 = <<10*5=50>>50 people attending the party.\nSo she needs 550 g to make chili for 10 times 50 g = <<550*50=27500>>27500 servings\nThis total is 2 times 432 g since 432 * 2 = <<432*2=864>>864 servings.\n\nNext she starts by subtracting 29g from 50 and 2 from 27500, which gives her 27261 g.\nNow the difference between 550 and 27262 g becomes 27000/287 = <<27000*287=8276>>8276 g.\nNow divide 8276 by 8 = <<8276*8", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}

However, if the old man wanted to pass his time then he would read a romantic novel while if he wanted to mentally challenged then he would do some brain exercises, however, if the old man simply wanted to win then he should go back to work instead of doing crossword puzzles.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe correct answer is choice A because crossword puzzle helps old men in improving their brain power and improves their vocabulary. Besides crossword puzzle can also help old people to pass their time and relax. So, that old man who solved crossword puzzles would pass his time by solving crossword puzzles. I think the correct answer is A because crossword puzzles are simple and also they help people in passing their time and improve their memory power. I also believe that if the old man who did crossword puzzle was retired then to pass his time he would do crossword then if he wanted to relax then he would read a book. So, if we look at those 4 choices the correct answer is A.\n\n## Expected Questions, Rationales\nHow to get better at logical reasoning?\n#### Rationales:\nReading questions and their solutions that are available in our platform would help to improve your logical reasoning, so the more you read those you will be able to get better at logical Reasoning.", "answer": "B: pass time"}

If the desired height will not meet the standards of the desired body type for either gender it should tell them the body weight required for their body height and the body type.

In this case, a candidate' s reference saying they were the best player is a success\n\n### Rationales:\nJohn is an exception to the rule of the basketball team that he is the best out of the whole team. It means that he is the the exception to the rule.\nIf the rule of the team says that they are the best, then John's reference that he is the best is also a success\n\nHowever, when the candidate' s reference does not confirm the rule (the team was the best one in the league), it doesn't lead us to believe that the application was reasonable to believe.\n\n### The rule here is that candidates who are the most talented are always accepted to be the best player on the team, while John was accepted in the team and was the best of the team\n\nJohn's reference does not lead us to believe that John was the best.

So what the question is asking for is 5*5^20=5^22 which is 75 and the same goes for 6*6^20=6^22 which is again 75 or 5*5^30=5^31 and the same goes for both 6*6^30=6^31", "answer": "C: corner"}

What will the consumer do to maintain the same level of gas intake without altering their lifestyles?\nThe price of anything will be affected by the cost of production and supply. The price may also be influenced by an event like a shortage. Thus, if the cost of petrol to the consumers rises by say 10 dollars, consumers will purchase at the same quantity. A shortage may also cause the consumers to purchase less while the prices of the petrol will increase.  This will not alter their lifestyles but a shortage will be more likely.\n\n### Inputs :\n\n### Response :\n\n\n### Democratation :  \nThe cost of living will increase the income of a individual who receives a certain incentive and wage in the public sector, which is based on the number of hours spent at the job. The increase is known as cost of living adjustment (COLA), and it compensates employees and pensioners if inflation and price levels rise as a direct result of the rise in living costs. This compensation is dependent on the number of hours the worker has spent at the job, which also means that if a person works for less hours, there is no compensation. In spite of the fact that the government has attempted to lower the prices of basic commodities by offering tax reliefs, this is a poor indication for the working class.\n\n\n### Rationale :\n\n\n## 6.

This is because consumers adjust their consumption according their income and preferences to the fluctuation in price based on their preferences.

If John spent 8 hours in the kitchen, let's call that 1 hour. In 1 hour John used 1 cans. Then, John spent 1+ 18=$<<15+1>>16 hours in the kitchen. If he spent 1 hour on the cake itself, John made the cake in 20 hours.\n\n#### 20\nAnswer: 20\n\n### Instructions: Write a mathematical sentence that matches the instruction.

Round to the nearest thousand. Choices:1:3:42:1:1:11:3\n\n### Response\n\n1:3:4 means that there are 4 people in population 1, then there are 3 people in population 2, and there are 4 people total in population 3, and 1 total in population 4\n\nHowever, I cannot really tell the answer until I look at 1:1. 1:1 is saying there are 4 people where the population equals 1. This means that the population of 1 is 4, and 4/1 is 4. I need to plug that into 1:3:4, so then it would be  1:3:3:4.", "answer": "D: get arrested"}

{"text": "Answer: A\n\n### Instructions:\n\nProvide a short description of your solution. Include your own feedback on its correctness.\n\n### Solution:\n\nFor (1), I was unsure on what the instruction meant by 'and' and how to proceed. Thus I created two separate IF statements, where each function tested for one of the conditions.\n\nFor (2), I began by separating the equation into 2 parts, since each player scored a different number. I then multiplied the second part of the equation by 100/2 and divided it by 20 to get the answer.\n\nFor (3), I separated the equation into parts based on whether the player scored 30 or 15 goals.\n\nFor (4), I knew at this point that I would have to use the modulo operator %. However, I had no clue as to what the modulo operator would return, since there is a cap on the number of goals scored.\n\nFor (5-6), I reused the modulo operator that I used in (4) and reworded the IF statement to better understand the question.\n\nFor (7), I assumed since the 'calculations' are a noun, that it is talking about Tom's math, and that he is inaccurate. Since this is a case of the \"If this, then ______\" rule, I simply put down E since that is the right answer choice.", "answer": "E: inaccurate"}

{"text": "For this question you have two important things to understand. The first important thing is what each choice means. This is important because you need to make sense of the problem when trying to come up with your response. Each choice is a noun and describes some aspect of the cow. You will need to understand this concept in other questions as well. The second important thing to understand is this type of question. This type of question has you identify what choice completes which noun choice. The noun choices are the first part and the choices is the second part. For this question we have to identify what choice goes where. This means you will need to arrange the noun choices in a way that makes sense. For this question we can start with the meat grinder and use it for c. Here we have the cow in a stable grinding meat on a red barn. Then we can use the stable to go with the green field. That gives us the cow inside a stable with green fields outside. However, notice we already used green field in our arrangement. Well, that means we can use the gate instead. Using that we can have the cow in a green field with a red barn outside the gate. That answers all the choices with the exception of the red barn. That means we need to find another place for the red barn. I think the green field is a pretty good one. It gives us a picture of cow in a grass field that stays outside all of the time even in the rain.

A restaurant is looking to remodel the kitchen and is deciding between two different contractors: A and B. A has 15% lower quoted price, but the lead-times on the project can potentially be 30% longer. The project is expected to use on average 1000 man-hours of labor, and the cost per man-hour is $50. Contractor A has higher profits, but can finish the project 50% faster. Which contractor should be chosen?\n#### A\n\nRationales: Contractor A could be chosen. Contractor A\u2019s price is 15% lower than B\u2019s, and B is 30% slower. Overall, contractor A would take on an extra 30% of work. When contractor A completes the job in 30% less time, work is taken on on an extra 150% of the total work. For 30% more time, contractor B is paid 150% more. So it will take contractor A 50% fewer man-hours to complete the job.\nThat would save 50% in time, and that is an extra 15% of time. So if contractor A was paid $50 per hour for 150% total work, then contractor B would be paid $50 per total work * 150% time = $$50*150%=<<50*15/100=37.5>>37.5.\n#### 37.5\n\n2.

He had a bucket with a three-foot handle, and so he decided he could carry the bucket up 3 feet of rope on his back, and then he would make 3 trips up and over the hill at a rate of 2 trips per hour. How much rope would he have left over?\n\n### Response\nRationales: Lets call the length of the rope A, We are given that the length we need to carry on our back is A-3, This works out to be 23 feet.  So we have 3x7,200 in miles.  So he needs 21,600  miles to carry the rope and bucket.  The number of miles he needs to carry over the mountains would be A-23.  Lets just simplify that to A-23, so he needs A-23 miles more to complete the task.  So he needs A+23.  But the number he is given is 3,235, miles.

It was a great and mighty empire. It enriched the lives of people who lived there in many ways. One of those ways was the development of philosophy. There were many schools of philosophy. It all began with Socrates. He lived in Athens. However, it was not Athens where Socrates began his work. He started in the market place. He questioned the rich and elite citizens of Athens about their views and opinions about everyday life. He would ask difficult questions designed to show how they lacked any real understanding of the world around them. He got their attention because he did not give the easy answer or the \u201cright\u201d answer. He didn\u2019t tell anyone what he believed. He just asked lots of questions. Today, we have Socrates to thank for a lot of Western philosophy. In addition, one of his students continued his teachings. The student\u2019s name was Plato. Plato continued Socrates\u2019 work by writing about the philosopher\u2019s ideas. We have the work of these philosophers today. Plato\u2019s writings and the thoughts of other philosophers would become the foundations of academic philosophy. He was one of the original people to formulate logic and the first to establish rationality as its own branch of philosophy.\n\n#### Socrates\n[A](https//en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Socrates)\n[B](http://www.historyonthenet.com//Articles/Socrates/Socrates.htm)\n[C](http://www.biography.com//People/Philosophers/Socrates-20901237)\n[D](https//en.wikiquote.org//wiki/Nel", "answer": "E: plantation"}

He would then know that he is being watched and would then say hi to you.\nYou will have to have people come closer so you can give them a smile.\n\n#Answer D:\nIf you feel happy all the time than people will pay attention to you.  They will smile back and then say hi to you as well.  If you want them to cross the street then you have to wait on them to come to you.  Once they come to you then you will be able to cross the street and say hi.  They had to know you were there for them to come to you to say hi.\n\n\n#Answer E: \nThis kinda goes back and forth of the answers.  \nWhen you are feeling happy you can smile at the person.  The person might smile back and wait for you to cross the street to say hi.\nThe person is also feeling happy but not as happy as you.  When he saw that you saw him he will start to feel happier.  He will cross the street and yall will cross the street and say happy New year.\nOr the person can just be feeling happy and say hello back.\n#Answer:E\n\n---\n\n### Input:-  Adam can make a table or chair or bench in 1", "answer": "B: shout at"}

(https://www.violinist.com/discussion/article/turkey-has-the-highest-violinist-per-capita-rate/), but it doesn\u2019t have very many fiddle, because fiddle is slang for \u201cfiddler\u201d and fiddler is someone that plays a violin.\n\nC is incorrect because an orchestra could have thousands of fiddles - the instrument that all violin players play on in an orchestra is a viola, not a fiddle.\n\nE is incorrect because, just in looking at the name of the store, it does not seem like this store could have many fiddle, since fiddle is slang for fiddler, and a fiddler plays a violin.

That\u2019s because you have no more than one instance of that number: if you have two, you multiply and get four.

Green + Green=Green D.Green + Red=Green\n\n\n### Response A\n### Demontration :\nWhich of these is a function?\n\n1. Red + Red= Red\n\nWe can substitute any values for red.\nThe result is always red.\nSo, it is a function.\n\n2. Red + Green = Red\n3. Green + Green = Green\n\nWe can not substitute any other value for green.\n\n4. Green + Red = Green\n\nSince green is only one of the given options, it is not a function.\n\n####\nAnswer:A\n### Input :Garret drove 15 km in 20 mins but drove 4km in 30 mins.What percentage did he drive per minute?\n\n### Response :B\n### Demontaion:\nGarret drove 40mins,so the car was moving at an average speed of 2km/hr.\nGarret drove an average speed of 1.2 km/hr.  But, he drove at an average speed of just 2 km/hr in the second half of his trip.\nSo he spent 1.2 km=0.12(1km=0.1) in the first 15km and spent 2km on the further 4km.\nSo, He spent 1.2 + 2 = 3.2 km/hr in both halves, that is, 4 times more in the latter half. so, he spent just 3.2/4 * 30 = 21 min= 21/60hours.\n#### \nAnswer : B\n### Input:For every ten yards, a man runs 10 seconds.

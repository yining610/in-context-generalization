(C) and (D) are not the phrases (\"make\" is not used in that way in normal English syntax or semantics, and \"judge\" means something else in that sentence).

You need to be able to determine exactly how many people are in the classroom and how many people there are in total.\n\nUsing that same logic, I have rewritten the question for clarification.\n\nInstruction: Answer the following multiple choice question:\nIn a classroom, there 27 people. How many chairs does the classroom have when you include:\n3 tables, 10 blue chains and 6 white chairs?\n\nAnswer: [How can i determine the number of chairs in the classroom with the given clues?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65677808/how-can-i-determine-the-number-of-chairs-in-the-classroom-with-the-given-clues)\nI answered this question by taking the clues written down and creating a nested for loop (for example: n = total amount of chairs in the room)  If user input is given for each chair it is multiplied by the value of the loop. And then the amount of user input is taken (user input is taken here because I used 25 for chair and 30 for table in my question) if the user input is 25 the number of chairs and tables should add up to 55).", "answer": "C: michigan"}

{"text": "In your example, you stated that all the characters had 80 cards in their deck. That means that the sum of the deck of cards was 80. But you were then asked how many there were in all. But why all? If there are no uncounted cards in the game then 40 cards can only come from one of the individual players. So, this question is wrong.\n\n### Explanation:\nThis instruction refers to a previous instruction but doesn't repeat anything significant so it may not need to be restated. It will be important to understand what your model did to be able to answer this question. To determine the cards that you had in the first place, the player would count them if they had a deck. From there you would add the cards from the other player. But the instruction itself doesn\u2019t clarify this. Since there is no restatement of the previous instruction, it could be assumed that the two players each had 80 cards for each total deck, not individual card decks. So instead of only including 40 cards for each player we would need to change that calculation to 120 cards.\n\nAnswwer: E: might dream", "answer": "E: might dream"}

The classroom is a place that is used to show what is being taught about the subject being taught.\n\n### Answer: B and D\n\n## Summary\n\nThe answer choices in these problems are not very accurate. For example, the answer to \u201chow many cards do they have\u201d is 211 and not the expected 151. The other problem is similar. They are not accurate because they ask you how far Pete walked from his house, not how much farther Pete walked from his home. To answer the question, we need to know what the actual distance was.\n\nThe answer to the question of how many chairs are in a classroom is 67 and not 27.\n\nFor example, if we take \u201cA\u201d and combine it with \u201cB\u201d we get \u201cAB\u201d. This gives us B. If we combine \u201cA\u201d and \u201cC\u201d, we will get \u201cAC\u201d. That will give us C. This gives us one for A, one for C, and another for D.\n\n## Resources\n\n\n\n## \u00a9 2021 Trilogy Education Services,  a 2U, Inc. brand. All Rights Reserved.", "answer": "E: garden"}

The type of problem that you will need to solve is called a tally question. A tally question requires you to count the total of two or more integers. For example, if you count up how many marbles are in one jar, that is a tally question.\n\nFollow the steps to solve these tally questions.\n\nWrite an equation to represent the problem.\nIn the equation, one side shows the total of how many marbles you have that side. The other side shows how many marbles we pick with each of those picks. The equation represents the number of picks that you have to make to find every last marble that you've picked up.\n\nIf the number of marbles that you've picked is less than the number of marbles in the jar, then you can count up every one of those marbles to solve the problem.\nIf the number of picks in the equation is greater than the total in the jar, then add the remaining marbles to the total that you've already counted. Use this approach with every marble that you're left counting.\n\nIn the steps to solving the problem, make sure to include the final answer.

{"text": "Input:Jennifer is the oldest of 5 children. Evan and Michael are the next two oldest. The two youngest are Adam and Andrew. Which is the fourth oldest child?\n\n  Answer: Andrew\n\n  Output:There is a way to count 650 people from the beach if:\n  650 people are in line for the ice cream.  Each person takes a turn so the same person does not get in line twice.  There are enough ice cream cones for every one in line if every person takes a turn. How many people are in line for ice cream?\n\n### Output:\nThe man standing at the bus stop is not from Chicago, as he is 2000 miles from home. He is 20 hours and 45 minutes away from home. He takes a plane at 5PM that day that arrives two hours later at 7PM to his home. What time does he leave for the bus stop?\n\n  Answer and Explanation:\n2000 is multiplied by 2 and divided by 2 with the remainder being 7:20.\n5PM is the 5th of the month so 2000*2=4000, 4000/2 becomes 2000 again and 2000/2 is 1000 or 7PM. 7PM would be his arrival time.\n\n  Input:If there are 650 people on the beach, how many can have a snack if there are 185 chairs and only two of them are reserved?\n\n  Answer C: If there are 65 people in the line, 2.5 can have a snack. 185 is 5 times 37 and 37 is 2.5 times 15\n\n  Input:The man standing at the bottom of the stairs is 6000 miles from his home.

He would go on to say, \"And people that live together are like married people, so why do married people ask each other every morning, \"Why are you leaving me? and \"Are you happy?\". So then I had an idea. I am going to create a speech therapist program that will make every sentence that I ask, \"Why are you saying that and \"Are you happy?\" I will say \"A: make music\", \"B: believe in god\" \"C: give speeches\" \"D: complete sentences\" and \"E: build houses\". I would love to see this in action.\n\n#### Expected Output\n\nResponse to question: B - Believe In God\nBecause of the statement, \"A: make music\" and \"B: believe in God\" the program decides that the correct answer of the choices is \"B: Believe In God\".\n\nResponse to question B: Are you happy?.

{"text": "The correct answer is Brains.\n\n### Justification: Brains, names, brown hair, eyes, and even will are things often shared among members of a family. The phrase \"share the same\" implies that things are shared equally between siblings. In the case of names: for the most part, parents try to chose a name for each child that hasn't been recently used. If parents have five children, they don't want their children to be known as \"Ralph Jr, Jr\", \"Sally Jr, 2\", \"Jack Jr, 3\", \"Bobby Jr, 4\", or \"Michael Jr, 5\". To avoid this, siblings are often given names that aren't popular. Brains is chosen because most of the time, all the members of a family have access to the same education, whether it is through public or private schools, and they often share information about important scientific discoveries. Also, the brain is often used in describing the \"smarts\" or the \"intelligence\" of a person. Family members often compare their childrens' IQs, or they may even be used for competitions among members of the family.\n\n### Input\n  Input:  What does a man need to do to become a minister in most Christian churches?\n\n### Response\n The correct answer is he needs to have a good mind and a good heart.\n\n### Response Justification:  A minister needs to have a good heart because he is a servant of God. He is responsible for serving and protecting the members of the church he is affiliated with. Without a good heart, a minister wouldn't have an appropriate focus.\nThe minister needs to also have a good mind.  A minister needs to be able to interpret the bible and study God. If a minister doesn't have a good mind, then he wouldn't be able to read the bible, and he would also lack the required learning that is required to be a minister.", "answer": "B: names"}

What if the only way we can know the final count is by summing a number of values together?\n\nIn that case, the sum of the products of the rows and columns is equal to the value of the product of the columns and the product of the rows.\n\n### Example\nFollow up on the first problem. Now determine the number of chairs in the class.\n\nInput: In the classroom there are 50 blue chairs, 7 green chairs, and 13 white chairs. A student has to sit on a chair from the last two categories since there are more of them. Of the two remaining seats, one of them is a blue chair, and the remaining is one of the remaining chairs (green or white). The student wants to be the only one in his classroom. How many seats are left for the remaining students? How does this total compare to the total seats in the classroom?\n\nAnswer: The remaining student can choose chairs 423 or 424\nThen 19 chairs remain plus 423 or minus 423\nAdditionally, the total seats is the sum of the product of the rows and product of the columns.\nThus, 2536 (green) + 3948 (blue) + 549 (white) = 6087 (a solution to the problem).\n\nInput: A box contains 10 yellow cubes, 31 green cubes, 25 blue cubes, and 5 white cubes. The first 8 cubes are yellow. The sum of the values of the first 7 cubes is 5 times the number of blue cubes. The sum of the products of every two cubes is 106.

{"text": "Writing a program to compute answers is one thing, but proving your answers with code is another. How do you do it?\n\nIn Python, there are many data types and operators that may prove useful in computing answers to mathematical problems. Read this section to become more familiar with these data types and operators.\n\nPython's arithmetic operators do exactly what you would expect them to do. There are a few of them, many of which are useful for computing mathematical answers. These operators have the following special rules in Python:\n\n    + Addition\n    - Subtraction\n    * Multiplication\n    / Division\n    % Modulo (remainder)\n    ** Exponentiation\n\nPython's built-in data types are called **primitives**. The built-in data types in Python include the types that represent the data on your computer directly, rather than storing data that points to information. These types also provide powerful operators using mathematical functions and comparison operators. They include:\n\n    **None**\n    **Bool**\n    **Int**\n    **Long**\n    **String**\n\nWhenever an expression appears in Python code, Python evaluates the expression according to its rules for evaluation.\n\nLet's take a look at a math example and work through it. The program asks for the answer to the expression, \"What is ten more than three times ten?\"\n\n\n```python\nx=30\ny+y+3*x\n```\n\nNote that Python evaluates expressions using operators in this order: left to right, precedence, division, addition, subtraction and multiplication.\n\nWhen Python completes an expression, it assigns the value to a variable and places any remaining operations in a queue. It then starts from the beginning and proceeds until the queue is empty.\n\n\n```python print(y+y+3 * x)\n```\n\nLet's see it in action. \n\n\n```python x=3\ny=30\nprint(x+y+3*y)\n#330\n\nx=3\ny=10\nprint(x**x+x+3*y)  #147\n\ny=5\nprint(y+y-y); #0\n\nx=10\ny=5 \nprint(x-2*y)", "answer": "C: freezer"}

Next, your program should print the student's GPA as well as list the student's cumulative GPA for all semesters.\nFor your GPA calculations, you may assume that the letter 'F' has a value of zero, and you will use the letter 'X' instead of the letter 'E', as sometimes used in colleges and universities to represent a credit for a course that could not be passed. The only letter grade not supported is the 'P' which stands for 'passing.'\nFor your cumulative calculations, assume that the cumulative grades of two semesters will have 6 units.

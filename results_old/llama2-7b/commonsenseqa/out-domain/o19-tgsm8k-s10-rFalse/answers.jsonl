How many steps does he walk each minute, on average?\nAnswer: 96\n\n### Instructions:\nThis task requires you to identify a set of numbers and order them in terms of their distance from the number zero.\n\nThe first number is the distance unit. For example, in a distance unit of 100, a number that is 100 would be closest to 0, and numbers 97 to 102 would be in between zero and the first number. Subtract and divide the second and third numbers by the first, then subtract the second number from the first, that is, 101 \u2212100/100 = 1. Subtract that number from the first number (1 \u2212 100/1 = \u2212100), and divide the remaining number by the first number (\u2212(100 \u00f7 100) = \u22121). Then divide the third number (103) by the remaining number (\u22121). That gives 103/\u22121 = 103.\n\nFor this case, the first number is 10. To determine how close another number is to 0, follow these steps:\n\n1) Subtract and divide.\n2) Subtract the result from 10.\n3) Divide by 10.\n\nAnswer: The numbers are 689,354 and 1734. The distance between them is 10.\nThe distance from zero is determined as follows:\nFirst: 689, 354, and 0\nSecond: 689 \u00f7 10 = 68.9\nThird: 354 \u00f7 10 \u2212 68 = 25.4\nThe fourth and final: 1734 \u00f7 1 \u00f7 68.9 = 1734\n\n### Inputs:\nGiven numbers and direction are at either end of the scale, and the numbers are increasing.

Let\u2019s call him fragile and the opposite, durable. In movies, two people often get into a fight. They\u2019re called an antagonist and main character. A lot of movies start with the antagonist attacking the main character. The antagonist is a bad guy, the bad guy. In this movie we have a bad guy who is fragile and an opposite who is durable. The main character is fragile, like fragile, and the bad guy is the opposite, durable, like durable. The bad guy is a bad guy. The main character is a main character.\n\n### Response\n\nWe need an opposite, to be durable. We want to be able to walk, talk and use our limbs. We can\u2019t be durable if we have to be fragile and use the opposite. We\u2019re not only fragile, we have no powers, which is what makes our being durable a problem for our weakness.

{"text": "A\n\n### Input\nA group of fishermen found a young shark 700 kilometres from where they usually catch sharks. It measured a little over 30 centimeters. \nThe sea was murky and there were only small rocks for over 6 kilometres, so it\u2019s unlikely they  had been attracted by food. \nThey had just happened upon him when they had spotted him.\n\n### Input \nA group of explorers has traveled to a newly colonized planet. They find themselves  in a very dry area and have no water to drink. However, they see two large ponds, filled to the surface with water. They decide to dig a well from an underground spring near one of the water spots. With a lot of luck and effort, they are able to dig to the underground water before the water in the surface ponds entirely dries up. After the well is dug, they place a pump in the well to draw the water up to the surface. They have not brought a very big pump, so they are unable to use all the water in the well. They pump the water into buckets and place it in nearby barrels. There is a total of 4,500 litres of water in the nearby barrels. The area is fairly small and only contains 150 barrels. With the water they bring, the pond contains 130 litres. In addition, the groundwater near the pond is at a depth equal to the diameter of the well. In other words, the groundwater of the planet is at a depth to where the water flows into the well and there is no water near the well that could be used to refill it. Additionally, this groundwater has only been able to enter the well when there has been water in the pond above the groundwater and therefore also only becomes groundwater when water from any nearby water sources enters that specific pond. After the pond has dried up, groundwater can no longer flow into the well unless one of the nearby water sources contains more water than the water lost by the well. The nearby water source with the smallest water source is a lake. The lake has a depth of d, where the groundwater becomes water near the lake. The lake has area A. The water from the well that flows into the barrels does not flow into", "answer": "C: open ocean"}

How many meters in a foot?\n\n### Response\nAnswers: meters = feet\n### Explanation\nThe rock climber is planning to climb a huge rock. He climbs steadily all the way to the difficult section, where he struggles to find his path. He will have to climb steadily in that difficult section, but will then face an increasingly difficult stretch of climbing. He is not planning to climb many meters. While he might try to climb in a straight line, to the top, he may not do it. And, since he struggles at the difficult section, he might not even make it to the top. Hence, he does not plan to climb many meters, so choose the smallest answer possible.\n### Examples:\nThere is a huge rock in the middle of the mountain.\nThe rock climber plans to climb to the top.\nThere are many difficult sections.\nThe climber might not climb many meters.\nHe wants to climb as far as possible, but he might not reach the top. He might even fall and have to turn back.\n\nThe rock is huge. It is so high it probably is taller than a two story house.\nThere is such a large mountain that it may even be tall enough to have a full view of the horizon.\nThe rock climbing route is difficult. It is so difficult that he will probably be tempted to move to a easier route.\nBut the rock climber does not need to follow the easiest route.\n\n### Input 2:How long does a car travel when it travels through a space of one mile?

There are many types of phone numbers that we might face, but we can take in most of them as a whole by using the number of digits in the total phone number and finding its remainder.\n\nThe way we can find the remainder of a number is by splitting up the number into a group of 10-digit chunks(10-digit-pairs or 1-digit-pairs) and finding the remainder of the first chunk, repeating that until we don't have any more chunks left.\n\n### Demo: \nInput: You have to add the digits of xy (x and y are 1 digit) to get z.

This is because no matter what, there will only be nine packs of gums in the box. The maximum price of the box can be found by subtracting $24 from $27 and dividing that answer by nine. The result is a number close to seven. That shows that in order for this game to succeed, the cheapest pack of gum has to cost $0.90 for it to still be cost-effective. (Although it is also possible that there's some minimum price that they have to charge in order to sell a box of gum. $0.90 seems like a number that is in the green in terms of profits, so I'd say that a pack of gum should cost no more than nine to maximize your profits.)\n\n### Input\nInput: Last night, your family finished 5 apples and half an apple tree.

{"text": "Pub, airplane, beer, store\n\n### Instructions:The game of 2048 is played on a grid containing 4x4 squares. The game starts with a 2x2 grid filled with tiles containing 2-digit numbers. The player manipulates the tiles using horizontal and vertical swiping motions. Once a tile is swiped, its content will change. If two tiles share the same number at the bottom, that number doubles and is moved to the right side of the grid. If two tiles are next to each other and share either the sum, or difference, of their two respective values each time they are touched, they will be matched and merge into a new tile containing the two numbers. This process continues and continues to yield higher numbers until the entire grid is filled with numbers from 2 to 1024. If two tiles can be added without having to make any new tiles, the player is awarded 200 points, which is the amount of points available to be obtained from each game session.

{"text": "C, which means idle time\n\n### Input\nIf a car drives 2100 mph (or 340.3 mph) then how far does it travel?\n\n### Response\nThe car traveled 2100 feet.\n\n### Input \nIt takes 3 minutes to fly from San Francisco to Portland (the capital of Oregon) on a jet. On a jet, 1 hour flies by very quickly. What is the ratio to the actual time of flying in comparison to the time it passes by in 1 hour?\n\n### Solution\n\nFirst, we need to find the relationship between time of flight, and the amount of time in 1 hour. Using the information from the question, we can determine that for 1 hour to pass, 3 minutes pass while flying. In 1 minute, the time passes by at a rate of 3 minutes.\n\nThus:\n\nFor 1 hour to pass: 3 minutes per 1 hour  \nFor a minute to pass: 3/60 minutes  \nFor 1 minute passes: 3 seconds\n\nIn 1 hour, the time passes by by 3600 seconds. In one second, it passes by by 3 seconds.  \nThus:\nHence, when time passes by in one hour, 3 minutes passes.\n\n\nTherefore, while flying, the time passes by 3 minutes for every 5 minutes.\n\nHence, the ratio is 1:5.\n\n### Alternate response\nThe time it takes for the jet to fly is a ratio of \n\nThe time it takes to fly is 1 minute.\nThe time it takes each minute to pass by is 3 minutes. \n\n\nThe relationship of passing time and the amount of time passed in a minute is not important. This is because after a minute passes, you will only experience 3 minutes of flight. Thus, the ratio of time it takes does not matter. Thus, the ratio is 3:1.\n\n### Input  \nThe first book was published in 1859 and the last book was published in 2015. The first book published is 58 years before the first book published.

How much food is in your dog\u2019s bowl after n days?\n    Answer: 1.25 kg\n\n### Answer\n\nThe dog\u2019s bowl fills up with food in 24 hours.\n\n    n = 24\n\nLet us denote the number of days as:\n```\nd = 0, 1, 2, 3,..., n\n```\n\nNow, for each value of `d`,\nThe number of kilograms of food will be:\n```\n    d * 0.5, if d > 0\n    d * 1.25, else\n```\n\nFor 12 hours a day, the number of kilograms will be `2.5 kg`.\nAt midnight, the number will be reduced by `0.5 kg` per each day.\nAnd every day, from 0 to n, will make the number go down by `n/6th` of `0.5 kg`.\nWe can compute the number of kilogors of food as:\n```\n    food1 = d * 0.25 = food2 * 0.276 = \u2026 = food(n-1) * 0.532 = 0.533 * food(n)\n```\n\nWe can make a formula that works for the number of kilogers of food in the dog\u2019s bowl:\n```\n    # of Kilogers of Food = 0.25 * 1 + n * 0.527\n    # of Kilogram of Food = 0 + n\n```\n\nThe food remaining in the bowl will be `0 + n`, and the `n` days will be `24`.\nAnd `0 + n` will equal to `1.25` in `n` days.\n\n    # You spend a dollar today.

Multiplying by both numbers in the first step will give you too much.\n\n### Explantion - \nTo get the correct answer, 7.8% of 49 is 8. You then multiply 0.18 and 8. You get 1.44.

If you're calling me a 'good woman' then I have to be one of the very worst. B. I've been a lot of places and met a lot of women, and I can tell that you are absolutely insane.\n\n* \"Honey, you're a lot different\" = You are different from the woman's previous husbands' wives.\n* \"I have no idea what you are comparing me to \" = The speaker does not know what her husband is comparing her to. Since he is saying that he was going different women, she has a right to ask what he compares \"Honey, you are a lot different\" to. She assumes that he will compare her to a different wife of previous husbands. She asked if he is calling her a \"good woman\". The first two sentences have the same meaning. But her third sentence has a different meaning; She is saying that her husband made her feel like he is being flattering by saying that her is totally different from all the other men he has been with.\n* \"I've been to a lot of places and have met so many women\" = This part is implying that he's been with different types of woman and he is saying that his wife is different from other women that he has been with.

They should place the candle in a place where it won't be stumbled over by people. \n\n### Input Score:\nIn this example the input score should be `B`. Because the candle is located near the kitchen, as well as in close proximity of many people the score is decreased and makes the task harder for the user.\n\n### Solution:\nAnswer: B\n\n### Solution Example:\nThe solution is the place where the candle should be put. In this example case the restaurant should place the candle right beside the kitchen, and away from the wall and out of a lot of people's sight. However, if the restaurant is located in room with good indoor lighting with no dimly lit areas, then they should place the candle beside the wall. The restaurant should place the candles along the wall and not be in view of the dining table.\n\n### Score:\nThe output should be B or A. B is the answer that is correct for this particular example. But if there are darker areas in the room then the candle should be placed in those darker areas.\n\n### Explanation:\n1 : The restaurant should not place the candle on a wall because it is too hard to see the candle.\n2: Putting the candle close to the table will cause people to trip over the candle and the heat can burn people.\n\n#### **Hard**\n![Hard](./docs/hard.jpg)\n\n\n#### **Very Hard**\n![Very Hard](./docs/very_hard.jpg)", "answer": "D: table"}

{"text": "Choices:\nA\nMusic has been the thing that has been Bill\u2019s passion since he was 4. Now that he\u2019s in college, he has a room in his house where he has a great sound system and a decent piano. He even has an old upright piano in his music room. He loves music so much that Bill wants to spend his summer making music just for fun. He wants to make as much music as possible, so he decides to buy an upright piano. This piano is his favorite style, and the only downside to it is that he has to keep it in his living room instead of his band or music room. However, that is a downside that will be worth it for him. He has spent hours in his house playing his piano. Now it is time to buy his own!\n\nB\nBill has been a music student since elementary school, and his band teacher has always pushed him to be the best that he can be. She always says that he has a natural capability for music. His music teacher got him auditioning for the college band and for his first band ever. After his third audition last year, he was accepted into his college music and band program, where they\u2019ve taught him to play the flute for music class and saxophone for band class. He is extremely grateful for the teacher who picked up on his natural musical abilities and helped him pursue something important to him like she always wanted to. With this in mind, maybe she wouldn\u2019t love being the one to tell him that playing his saxophone is his last audition. She doesn\u2019t want to have to tell him that he was denied the offer because he was unable to successfully audition for the final time. However, if she does have to tell him that, she hopes that he understands her reasoning for telling him.\n\nC\nHis college offers music and band programs in which they teach their students to play an instrument as part of your class curriculum. Being in college gives him the chance to pick an instrument that he wants to play instead of playing the instrument that he\u2019s given by his school of music. He knows he has a lot of skill, so he is hoping to be able to play the saxophone because he thinks that it requires a lot of skill to do. He thinks that he could be an amazing saxophone player.

I do have a problem...I purchased the same item as you.  It cost me a month's wages to pay for it.  We have to talk about what you can do next to make a more informed decision.\n\n### My first thought is to have you take a look at the item.  If you are not sure about the item, I suggest getting your parents' or a teacher's recommendation.  It would help if you ask someone to check for any damage, and if they think the item is functional, they could help you check the price.\n\n### I also suggest doing a bit of research by going on the internet to read the product's description and price.  This will help you make an informed decision.  You can also ask your friends if they have ever used the item, or at least ask around the internet to see if anyone else is having similar problems with the item.\n\n### After making an informed decision, I hope you see the value of your money.\n\n### Sincerely,\n\n### Answer questions 2-10:Write a letter to Sami that completes a conversation.\n\n### Sami:Hi, Danny!  Let me tell you about my experience with that item.  I was sure I had done my homework by deciding to buy it.  However, I was disappointed because I didn't check the price of the item before the purchase.  50% of the price, to be honest, is not worth the hype that you see on television and online marketing, so I had to make a big sacrifice in the process.  I hope you check the prices when you decide to purchase something.  My advice to you is, \"Check twice before you buy.\" \n\n### How much did your purchase cost you?

Every year he goes to the market to buy nut and then he goes to supermarket to buy fruits. On a particular year, the market is selling 1 kg nuts at the price of 16$ per kg. The supermarket is selling 2.5 kg fruits for 8$ and it will give him a discount of 3$ if he buys 3 kg from it. The nuts cost him 12$ each, while the fruits cost 16$ each. What is the difference between a profit obtained by the man from the first activity?\n\n### Response : I believe the man's profit in the first activity is $77. It is important to notice that his profit of 12$ for a kilogram of nuts refers to the price at the market per kilogram while he only buys half kilogram to have 6$ profit with it. Therefore, in the first activity, he is buying 6 kg of nuts for $72 (the price for 6 kg at the market)  and making a profit of 12$. In the second activity, he is buing 3 kg of fruits for a price of $24 (the price for 3 kg at the market) for a profit of 16$\n\nSo he made profit of 12 + 16 = 28$ in the first activity and lost 3$ in the second.

Find 2 things from today's lesson that you found easiest to grasp.\n- *Integers are all whole numbers:* We know there are a lot of rules when we are dealing with positive and negative integers, like which will be the biggest possible and smallest possible number, and which way to write, for what number will subtract a negative number give you a negative answer, and so on.  In my opinion, all this information is a little complicated and confusing for beginners, but if we explain it in a more informal and intuitive way, students like me can still memorize it quickly.\n\n\n- *Decimals are composed of integers and fractions.:* This point, in my opinion, is also not the easiest thing to remember. We know that 7.7 is not a number, but is 77\u00f7 10, so that this decimal number is composed of the integer 77 and the fraction 77/10.  But why is there a 5 on the side of the fraction?  Because it means that the fraction of 77/1 is the smaller one in the numerator and the denominator.\n\n2. Find 2 things you found most confusing about today's lesson.\n- *Decimal* seems to have been invented just to make our lives more difficult.  Why couldn't they invent a system that can express all numbers?  Why didn't they use fractions to write numbers as large as 100,000?

{"text": "A\n\n### Explanation:Ans: A : Michigan The reason the traffic gets worse as you get closer to Michigan is due to the fact that many people, especially Americans are drawn to Michigan because they think the weather there will be better than anywhere else in the US. They think, probably because people say that Michigan receives more sunlight than anywhere else in the whole of the US and is not as cold or windy, that they will always have a sunny vacation if they came to Michigan and not have to worry about the weather affecting their vacation.\n\nI would guess the reason the rest stops are almost always empty is because they have nothing to interest tourists. But the expressways themselves will ALWAYS be very busy, and very crowded, especially if you are coming from the US side. As stated earlier, there are many Americans who are attracted to Michigan because of the weather and climate there, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s ALWAYS busy. If you wanted to get to Michigan and needed to use an Expressway, you\u2019re going to see lots of traffic.\n\nFor the Michigan tourist destinations: LOL, Michigan is known to be in the Great Lakes Region of the US. There are lots of destinations there. Tourist can explore Saginaw and see the Saginaw River which will have waterfalls, beaches, swimming, fishing, whitewater kayaking, and also sailboating. \nAnother place that people come to Michigan for is Detroit. There are lots of landmarks in Detroit such as the Detroit river, Campus Martius area, Greektown Casino and Greektown, Ford Field, Cobo Center, the Detroit Opera House, and much more. The places are very exciting, have lots of people and things to do. \nIf you're looking for more activities and places to go, there is also Ludington (a town just to the east). There are lots of places to see there, they also have great festivals as well as having great events, concerts and parties in and out of Ludington. \nIf you need a vacation and want to experience something new, Michigan is the place to be.\n\n### Inputs:The following is the answer to a question:A young man was born on 12 March 1968.

What's important is that an advertisement is crafted that can convince the consumer to consider purchasing the product. This requires a lot of persuasive techniques like:\n\n* A good headline that captures the consumer's attention\n* The most important attribute of the product displayed\n* Clear and concise testimonials and guarantees\n* The most compelling features and benefits displayed\n* The most popular price point displayed\n* A good call to action\n\n### Instagram Challenge\nHere are some of the most effective techniques to incorporate in your Instagram advertising:\n\n#### Headline\nA strong headline can take you from good product advertising to great product advertising. The headline is like the first sentence in an essay: it pulls you into the advertised product. It has one purpose and one purpose only: convince people to click on the advertisement.\n\nThe headline is more effective if it's placed in the first part of the posting (especially if it is in the caption instead of the main body of text), so that the first thing people see is a question or statement that sparks curiosity and interest. The main thing to remember with headlines is to keep thinking from your audience's point of view. \"What makes you interested in this type of product?\" and \"what would you click on if you were looking at the product from an outsider perspective?\"\n\n#### Showcasing the most important part of the product\nFor some types of products, the most important part has to be on display in the visual element of the posting (the photo or video) and the caption. The main product, such as a house or a car, should be pictured front and center for everyone to notice.\n\n#### Clear and concise testament\nTestimony from satisfied customers works great at telling anyone looking at your product about any of its great features (so long as it is true!). Don't rely too much on social proof (or the opinions of others) since that can lead to mistrust in your brand for those who may not", "answer": "A: communicating with others"}

This is because I had only one variable left on the lefthand side of the equals sign and I knew that I couldn't simply divide it by 4 because I had too many other numbers for the equation to just multiply it by something else to remove the 4 and leave the 4.4, which would give you the correct answer of.7. Instead, I had to use the idea that I need to subtract 4.4 from.7, then multiply my answer by 4, and so to get to the answer I needed to subtract.44(the number I got from that) from.7(the number that I need to get to the answer), which gives me.26, which is the answer.\n\n### Response1:I think my response is pretty solid and it was what I had expected.

The only reason why the problem was more challenging was due to the fact that the first problem only had one equation I needed to use. This problem involved a lot of different equations and variables as well as a different method of solving instead of what I tried to do because the numbers weren't in a simple 1-equation-equals-another-equation-in-which-1-of-the-equations-is-left over format.

{"text": "C\n\n### Response Explanation:\nThis is a logical inference from the context: computer devices are used in the computer science class. The class is not listed, but it is likely to be the class that uses computers the most. Hence, E is the answer.\n\n### Input\nWhere is a student working with large amounts of data, either in the school or his own work? Choices:   A: nature B: library C: home D: gym E: computer science F: toilet G: cafeteria\n\n### Response\n E\n\n\n**How it works**\n\nIn your brain, data is associated with information. The question states that the student needs to do something with large amounts of data. He could do it in the toilet where there's a lot of data, but it is unlikely. The computer science class is the logical choice.\n\nThe \"E\" button was selected, which is how you indicate \"exact\" matches in the answer key.\n\n\n### Input \nA student who can\u2019t find the right answer to the problem is talking to a teacher and shows the work he did. When asked, the student says \"it took me hours to figure this out. I should have taken the hard way.\" Why did the student say that?\n\n\n**How It Works**\n\nIn school, students are typically expected to learn certain things and certain ways of doing things. It is likely for a student to get confused about what way the teacher wants a problem to be solved, but in the end the student is expected to know how to do the math. When the student says \"the hard way\" they are making a mistake because the hard way is the correct way.\n\n\n\n### Problem \nIf you are planning to cook a ham for dinner and your recipe says to cook it at 280 degrees F, how long does it need to cook for at that temperature? \n\n\n**How to solve**\n\n\n### Answer Explanation \n1 hour\n\n\n\n\n\n## Answer Key \nIn this question, it is reasonable to assume that the school uses computers, even in the library. There is even a separate class.\n\n\n## Conclusion \nThis is a great game to spend a couple of hours playing while relaxing. It is fun playing against the computer, but there are so many more", "answer": "C: computer science"}

For the balloons, 15 different are many than the single type. Therefore, the answer is D \n\n### Input Rationales:\nInput: The store is running a week-long sale, and only items that sell for less than $25 are 1/5 as much as the original price. If a cashier finds a t-shirt at a price of $12, and there are 695 t-shirts that cost $5 in the store, how much money would a customer need to buy the 1/5th discounted t-shirt?\nRationales If a cashier at this store finds a t-shit at a price of $ $12, and the price for this t-shirt is marked down by 20%, $12 * (50% off) = $6. Therefore, when a customer buys a t-shirt, they only pay $6.\nLet $C be the number of cashiers in the store and $T be the sale t-shirt price - the original price of the t-shit\nC * $T = $6/100 = T * 50% = 3.5 < 4\n\nSo C $ = <<C*50%>>3.5 \n\nAnd $T = the original price of any t-shirt.", "answer": "C: bitterness"}

So the proportion of Americans who prefer to go out is 60/60 = 100% or 100% of Americans actually prefer going out\n#### 100\nAnswer: 60\n\n### Instinct:A survey polls 230 Americans and found the following: 210 answered that they think the majority of young people who are influenced by the media grow up to be delinquents, 60 answered no, and 60 remain undecided. What percent of the surveyed Americans are undecided?\n\n### Denotation:The proportion of young people who are not affected by the media is given by 210 - 60 or a percentage of 4.

The driver then drove on the highway for 14 more hours. How many hours total did the driver drive?\nRationales This is an arithmetic sequence. Arithmetic Sequence- A sequence of numbers where only the order and the common difference is changed by adding a certain value to the difference and is repeated.\nIn this example, it could also be named as the second term of the sequence. Here the numbers in the sequence is 11 and 14, because they are the terms. Common difference is the first term subtracted by the next term.\n\nIn this problem, the first term 11 is +14 = 25. Hence the common difference is 25 - 11.\n\nAnswer: 36\n\n### Input\nThere were 656 cats in New York in 2000.

{"text": "Choice A:\n\n### Rationales:\nBookstores provide books, journals, newspapers, magazines, and other reading materials to customers. Books are sold in bookstores but also are lent out or borrowed from libraries. Libraries loan out books free of charge to customers, but may also sell books on their racks as a fundraiser.\nA) Book: A book is a document or a set of texts written and published in durable form for the purpose of reading.\nBooks can be categorized in many different ways, for practical purposes. The main categories are fiction, non-fiction, poetry, plays, and reference works (mainly to find facts or information). A basic division between fiction and non-fiction is a good way to make a first classification. A fiction book has a fictional author and a fictional setting. Non-fiction books describe true events and real people. Stories and books of fiction can be published as e-books, printed on demand (POD), or are available in libraries as paper books. Non-fiction is a broader idea that includes books and stories that are not fiction. Non-fiction does not present fiction or tell a story but is the communication of information about facts and reality to other people.\nWhen fiction authors compose a fictional story, they can use some non-fiction books and facts in history or geography to be a reference book for their story. The author in the novel must have a certain level of accuracy. For example, if you are writing a story set in a Victorian-era England, you can't have something that didn't exist for that time period, like internet access. Fiction and non-fiction are both written for the same purpose, communicating (or communicating) information to the audience. They are only classified as fiction or non-fiction, but they have different purposes. Non-fiction book can be classified again in genres such as travel writing, biography, philosophy, memoirs, self-reference, and more.\nFiction is often but not necessarily composed for adults, but non-fiction is always primarily intended for adults, in contrast to children's literature. Some fiction books may contain fictional characters, stories, and other fictional elements. However, many non-fiction books also contain fictional elements, such as in biographies and", "answer": "C: city"}

It will melt at 5\u00baC. For the next time it is served at -3\u00baC. What is the temperature of the bowl when you take it from the refrigerator and serve it?\n\n### Answer:1.2\u00baC\n\n### Rationales:Since the room temperature at 25 degree Celsius, 1.5degree lower than the room temperature, so the refrigerator temperature would be 23.5 degree Celsius.\nThe ice cream melts at a temperature of 5. The freezer stores the ice cream at a temperature of -18.\nSince the ice cream is in a freezer, room temperature would increase with 10.5 degree. The ice cream room temperature is 34.5.\nThe ice creams room temperature 34.5 degree Celsious = 1.2 * 34.5 = 42.3.\n1.2 = <<1.2*34.5=42.3>>42.3\nSo, the temperature of the room is 1.2 degree Celsious\n\n### Question 1\n\n#### 3.24\nAnswer: 3.24 m\n\n### Instructions:Answer these two decimal placement questions in each of two columns.\n#### Question 1\n\nInput: Place a decimal on the tape measure.

The largest pyramid called the \"Khufu\" is the Great Pyramid in Giza, in the middle of the Nile River Valley, in Egypt.  The Pyramids of Giza were all built between the Nile River in the northwest and the Mokattam hills to the southeast. To construct a pyramid, the Egyptians transported huge stones from quarries far away. The stones were transported using ramps to the area. Next, thousands of slaves placed  rows of stones to create a series of horizontal layers called \"courses\" of stone that made up the pyramid blocks.

My father has a bag with a black cover.\"\n\n### Response:\"In my school, I have bags with blue covers, and red covers, and green covers, and purple covers.\"\n\n### Rationalizes: The children are given an assignment to share information on the topic of the class. The children were asked to describe a bag with a different colored cover, instead of just naming the color they put a statement about its characteristics.

And most of the time, if the car is full, you usually leave your items in the trunk and continue to drive\n\n### Input :If you had to choose one place to hide your cash (a) the trunk of your car, (b) your friend's house, (c) your uncle's house, (d) your church, or (e) a bank\n\n### Response :c\n\n### Rationales:\nThe church: This is a very difficult choice. The church may feel like a safe place to hide, but if someone goes to the church looking for the money, they could look everywhere including under the pews where the money could be hidden. The right answer would be to take it to your uncle's house first and then to the bank. Since hiding money in your church would not be advisable, the person prefers to hide money in his friend's house. But if he leaves his home to visit his friend, there is a chance he will take the money with him and hide it somewhere\n\n### Answer :c\n\n## Input:You see a large group of people standing outside the bank.

Since 1/3 people love chocolates and 1/3 people do not love chocolates then 2/3 is the fraction of the people that does not love chocolat.\n\n### You can change the fraction to percentage by multiplying the fraction to 100 and you will get 1/3 is 33.33% and 2/3 is 66.66% which is half the whole.\n\n#### 1/3 = 33.3%\n\n#### 2/3 = 66.6", "answer": "B: populated area"}

For what month does Martha have an average monthly temperature of 54 degrees and an average monthly rainfall of 4 inches?\n\nRationales: So when September has an average temperature of lowering and rainfall of 3.25 inches, (3.25 / 3) = <<3.25/3=1.1>>1.1 rainfall is decreasing as temperature is rising. Therefore, for the average monthly temperature in Oct, the rainfall has to rise from Sept. In Martha's case Sept has rainfall of 1.67 inches, so it should rise to 4, 5.33 inches to answer the question\n\nInput: In the school, the library has 3 desks, the computer lab has 4 desks, and the main office has 3 desks. A total of 6 students work at the library and want to use a computer. How many are remaining desks to use the computer in these rooms if the main office has 2 computers, the computer lab has one computer, and the library has no other computers?\n\nRational: If the library has 3 + 4 + 3 = 10 desks, which includes main office + computer lab + library. So, 40% of 10 is 10. The main option for the total is using 10, then we subtract the amount of desks left to find the answer. So, we are given 10 desks. Desks left are: 2 +1 = 3. But, there is only 10. So, if 2 students from the computer lab cannot fit on a single computer, the computer lab has the most amount of students to", "answer": "C: mass hysteria"}

(For example, \"I need adventure not only in my work but also in my life. Hence, I feel happiness is not enough and need joy in my life\")\n* B: Valuable: The word \"valuable\" indicates something that is priced higher than others. For example, \"this expensive necklace is so valuable\" or \"the gift given is not valuable enough\" indicates that the gift cannot satisfy us. (For example, the sentence \"life is so valuable that it has to be fully lived. I can enjoy life more with joy.\" or \"I can gain more joy from life when I fully live my life\" indicate that they feel happy is more valuable and happiness is insufficient for them)\n* C: Happiness: The word \"happiness\" is synonymous with joy. The word \"happier\" can mean two things such as 1. \"satisfy,\" and 2. \"given\" or \"gift.\" In response to the question, the meaning of \"given\" or a \"gift\" is more likely, and since there are many people who cannot get even \"the gift of happiness\" or \"gift of a happy life\" even if they have enough money in their life, this word \"happy\" is chosen. (For example: If one person says \"I was given the gift the happiness of life,\" the other may say \"I have never felt happiness in my life. I need a more adventurous life.\")\n* D: Early death: Dying is unnatural since it is supposed to happen to everyone after a long life, so the word \"early\" is added before death to emphasize. (For example: the word \"I want an early death because I feel that life will be much longer if I live a fulfilled life.\" implies that the person is willing to die young if it makes sense.)\n* E: Adventurous: The word \"adventurous\" is synonymous with unpredictable or challenging.

If the standard deviation is 74, how many standard deviations above the mean is the number that is 82?\n\n## Answer: If we want to know how many standard deviations 82 is above the mean, we need to first find out what the mean is. To find the mean, we add the values in the data set and divide it with the count of the data set. Mean= sum of all values divided by the count of the data. Using this mean value of 1018, a standard deviation of 74 is equivalent to a standard score of 1.64. The standard score is (1.64)(1018) = 0.17131. This tells us how many standard deviations we are from the mean.\n\n## Instruences: If the above instruction resulted in an error, follow this link to get help.", "answer": "B: complete sentence"}

{"text": "### Demostration:\n\n### Instructions:\nIn the given number sentence that shows the subtraction of positive integers, determine which option results in 5 as the answer.\n### Rationales\nOption A would result in an answer of zero and not five. This is because 7 minus 6 is 1 which would be in option B as the answer.\nOption A is therefore incorrect. This may be further clarified by looking at the subtraction of whole numbers. Whole-number subtraction can be shown as the result of the addition of a negative integer, such as -3 or -2, to the number that is to be subtracted.\nThe addition of negative numbers would bring about two positive numbers, so this is why option A would be incorrect.\nOption B states the answer as 1. Option C states the answer as 3.\nIn option D, the number that is needed to be subtracted is 15. If the subtraction equation had 15 subtracted and not 13, the answer would be in the same range. So, option D is correct because the answer range is correct.\n\n## Response:\n\n## Demonstration:Option D is a correct response, this is because option a would result in the answer as 0 which is not the given.

She types for 4 minutes before having to rest for 2 minutes. She continues in this manner for 3 hours. How many minutes did she write a total in all?\nRationale: When she was writing, she was doing so for 4 minutes. She had to rest for 2 minute breaks, so she wrote for 4-8 = <<4-8=4>>4 times before she had to rest. After she had rested for 2 minutes she continued doing so until she had to rest for the last time in 3 hours, she had to rest after writing for 18 minutes. We can calculate this as 4-2+2+2...*2=<<4-8=4*3=12>> 12 rest breaks. To sum this up, she wrote for 12 minutes, having rested for 24 more minutes. In total she wrote for 15 minutes before resting for a total of 49 minutes.\n#### 49\nAnswer: 49\n\n### Input\n\nRationales: Input describes a list.\n**List 1**: I own a puppy. My dorm has a cat.

Find the length of the ladder.\nRationales: Distance from the top to the bottom is 5 ft + 1 ft\nDistance from the bottom to the rungs is 2 ft - 31 degrees = 2 ft * cos (31 degrees) =<<2*cos(31)$cos(31)$3 ft\n\nSo, the length of the lad is 5 ft + (2/28) x 2 ft * cos(31) =<<5+((2/28)x2)/28=3.77>>3.77 ft.\n\n####\nAnswer: 3.77 ft\n\n### Input/Answer/Instruction: A 5-foot-long board measures $3.25 per linear foot.

You only have to leave the lid open for a second and the canned food won't even need any extra time to go bad.\n\nB is the wrong.

Also, if it is in any area where it is in contact with fire, it will be very easy to get damaged too. The canned food must avoid any contact with fire.\n\nC is the wrong choice.

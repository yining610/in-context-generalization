Katie’s dog, Bailey, is a great dog.  He likes to play football; he also loves to eat grass.  If Katie leaves the door open, he’ll just hop into the grass.  He even did so even when Katie had guests over.  The grass might seem pretty harmless, but there’s a big problem that happens.  The grass could make him sick and no, I’m not talking about some strange disease, I’m talking about Katie’s dog throwing up.  Katie’d dog gets sick, a lot.  Sometimes he throws up only once and other times he throws it up for hours.  While Katie was walking her dog one day, she saw her neighbor’s cat chasing after what Bailey was eating.  It was Katie’s dog’s best friend, the grass.  Katie ran immediately over to Bailey and commanded him to drop it.  He did so.  Right then and there Katie realized the grass was making him sick.  Katie would never let her dog eat grass again, especially when guests were inside.<n><n>### Task:<n><n>Answer questions 1 through 4.<n><n>To answer this question, read the following article and locate the information on the number of women who participated in the 1919 Women's Suffrage March.<n><n>https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/classroom-materials/lesson-plans/celebrating-women-in-democracy-0<n><n>Choices:  A)  2,600 women in the march<n><n>B 5,000 women in the March<n><n>C) 10,500 women in the mash<n><n>D) 17,548 women in the march<n>    <n>1.

Choices:  A: pain B: mudslide C: sweating D: injuries E: rain<n><n>### Response:		Option A: Pain - When an athlete gets injured and feels pain, that could be the reason why he/she couldn't compete in a sport, especially if the injury was serious enough. If it affected only the muscles or the tendons and they hurt while throwing, running, jumping, hitting or doing stretching exercises it can be really difficult to take part in some of games.<n><n>Option B. Mudslide - It happens when a player slips on the mud that appears on the ground. This situation is very dangerous, but it's very rare.<n><n>Option C. Sweating - If there is a heavy rainfall or a very warm climate during the game this can lead to serious sweating and this sweating can cause more serious conditions like dehydration and dizziness which can seriously affect sport performance and can cause even death.<n><n>Option D. Injuries - Injuries are serious or light physical injuries which can be caused by different physical accidents, some types of muscule tension, strain and pain. Different kinds of sports can cause different sports injuries that can occur at any moment, like slipping on a spot of ice, falling on the field, banging your head during the game etc. Injuries can be very serious, cause some big health consequences, require serious surgeries and long period rehabilitation.<n><n>Option E. Rain - In some situations, rain will be a really good weather situation, especially in warm areas and deserts, due to the fact that rain in such conditions can cause big sporting competitions like rainy athletics and rainy marathons. Otherwise it can seriously influence bad sport performance, when playing sports outside. To be more specific, water drops that appear on the field or on the pitch can cause serious damage to the sporting equipment, especially when they are metallic. This can be pretty tricky when throwing an iron thing in a direction of rain drops. <n><n><n>

Section-01 is the section where class names starts with-2,3,4,5,6,7, and 8.<n><n>  In this given instruction, the input means the cost of lunch and how many lunch will be given. So, the cost of 1 lunch will be double than the cost of 1 dinner and cost per one meal is double than the cost of breakfast. The total number of people who are going to get the lunch is at least 3 less than 6.<n><n>  The cost of lunch is $9, the cost of dinner is $18, and the cost of breakfast is $4, so a cost of 1 luch equals to $18 and the cost of 1 meal is $4, we can do the multiplication which equals to double the cost of lunch.<n><n>	So, we can calculate it as (9)(1) = $9 and (9)(1) × 2 = $18<n><n>	We will now calculate how many meals are going to be given, cost of one meal is $4 then the cost of 20 meals is $80.<n>	<n>	So, 20 meals = $80 ⇒ 6 less than 20 which equals to (14-6) = 8<n><n>### Input 2: I don't know what the correct answer is.<n><n>### Response 2:<n><n><n>I think the input is a list of name with grade.

Write a response that completes the task.<n>Input: A group of students are creating a plan to get ready for a local science fair. They all know that it takes a minimum of six weeks to build a working model which includes testing the model against an unknown goal condition. They have a total of 12 weeks before the science fair and they decide to work in pairs as to not make their group plan. <n>They have $80 and each pair is to use it to build an egg drop device that will protect an egg from falling 10 feet once it is dropped.  The eggs are not included in the cost and have to be purchased at the local grocery store. They decide to have one item that costs five cents. They want to buy 20 items that total five cents so there is ten cents worth of items per person in the pair to make a total of $2.50. <n>They also want to have one item that is fifty cents so there is $35 in total for the two people to use, not including the cost of the eggs. The items that cost five cents are for the eggs because the group has determined that an egg is the minimum amount that is needed for them to perform their task.  They decide to start by finding out how long it will take them to make the item that costs fifty cents. They begin with three paper towels which costs 10 cents. Two paper towels costs 50 cents. <n>Each person in the pair needs to pay ten cents for their item. They can use two paper towels, three paper napkins and one paper towel for 60 cents so to add 10 more paper towels would cost 60 cents.  One person can buy the items that are fifty cents for fifty cents while the other person can buy one item that costs five hundred dollars and one item that costs 75 cents. They spend too little time for their task so they decide to make one item that costs 25 cents for the rest of their supplies.<n><n>### Input<n>Answer: Two people will cost you $4.  The person that has five hundred dollars and the person that has $4 can give away their $4 to the person that is buying one item

Choices:  A: church B: theatre C: large city D: water fountain E: central park<n><n>### Response:		<n>In order to be able to answer this question and provide feedback to the question, it is important to first understand the context and specifications of the question. By doing so, we can then determine which answer choice is the most plausible and reasonable. One aspect of the question that can help to narrow down the possible answers is that it specifies that the object in question must be “large” and “many”. This suggests that the object in question may be a large structure or place, such as a building, park, or other public area. Based on these constraints, some of the answer choices seem less likely than others. Choice A states that a church could have hundreds of statues. While churches may have a number of statues, it is unlikely that all of them would be visible at one time. Similarly, choice B would be unlikely to have thousands of statues due to its use for entertainment. Choices C and D both refer to central parks, which may have numerous statues, but they would not likely all be visible at once. The remaining choice, E, indicates a large city, which likely has a variety of buildings and statues spread out across the city. As such, this provides the most plausible context for the question, and the answer choice that provides the most likely match would be choice E.<n><n>### Input:`Ali baked 42 muffins`<n><n>### Response:`How many muffins did she bake`<n><n>### Input:"Darwin and I worked on this project for 3 weeks."<n><n>### Response:"Who worked on this project?"<n><n>### Input"Their homework is due"<n><n>### Response`The homework is done by`<n><n>### Below are sentences from the play WE ARE PRESENTING ON OUR READING OF THE PLAY AND DISCUSSION.<n><n>### Sentence: There will be other monopoly games after these, of course.<n><n>### There is an applause after this sentence.<n><n>### Below is an instruction that describe a task.

(Choices: A. ignore B. enforces  C. authoritaria D. yell at  E. avoid)<n>### Input:What are some the differences between the first two paragraphs about children and teenagers(choose one of the following):<n>### A. children were easier to control than teenagers.  B. children were more active in their communities than teenagers.<n>### C. children had more chores to do.  D. children spent more time working.<n><n>### Response (1):<n><n>Because in the second paragraph, the phrase “more active in their communities” tells me that children are outgoing and sociable. That is different from the first paragraph, because in the first paragraph, there is an expression which says “more prone to distraction” which means that children are not interested in school. They just do random things they can’t focus on learning; they just spend less time in the school environment, they seem to be more like a teenager. <n><n>Input (2):<n><n>Because the first paragraph talks about parents and teachers think that school should be reformed to meet what children need, but the second paragraph talks about school don’t have a place for children. Therefore, the second paragraph is more likely to indicate the differences between children and teenagers.<n><n>Input (3):<n><n>Because there are certain rules about how much time the children have to do chores when compared to the time teenagers have.  In the first paragraph, there was no clear information on the age level children are, so I can’t judge what chores they are doing right now or how frequent it is. But the second paragraph makes two different comparison in detail, which makes it clearer to be understood what children

Choices:  A: backyard B: restaurant C: crockpot D: neighbor's house E: barbeque<n><n>### Response:		If you slowly grill food, you are using a barbeque. To grill food slowly in a backyard would be a barbeque but this is unlikely to be called as such by anyone I'm sure, nor would it likely be referred to as a grill. Instead, your friends may use a grill or even a barbecue to roast meat over an open flame in your backyard. However, the word barbeque is most commonly associated with cooking food very gently so as to allow the flavors to permeate and develop. This is the term used when one barbeques meats, vegetables, and many other foods at a low temperature and for a long time so as to develop the flavors of the foods being roasted. In barbequing, one typically cooks food slowly and on a low heat so as to let the flavors come out in the food. In contrast, in grilling one sears or chars one’s meat quickly and high on a grill, often using oils to prevent the meat from sticking to the grill.[1] According to Wikipedia’s article on barbequing, the word barbequing is not used in everyday colloquial speech. Because of this, one could not say that in barbequing you slowly grill the food. Barbequing is specifically a method of cooking food slowly and often on a grill, using flavors of various foods (oils, sauces, marinades) to develop over time. Thus when you roast anything with a grill, it is called grilling, not barbequing because it is not being slow cooked but it is being charred on a flame.[2] I could not agree more, as what they are saying is true. When using a grill, food is being roasted slowly over a fire. This has been termed grilling, not barbecuing. Therefore, when one uses a grill to roast meat, the common term used is grilling, not barbie queuing.<n><n>### D: Mary has 89 stickers that she is using to decorate her journal.

I do recommend making the first part a little easier because a student without experience finding the right answer in multiple choice may assume that there is only one way to get there. I will make one correction at this time which is in item #5:<n><n>`### Input: Mary had 112 stickers.  She wants to use at least 4 large stickers on the first page of her journal and then use at least 6 stickers on the other 6 pages of her journal and at least 2 stickers on the last page.  How many sticker is left over that don’t meet these requirements?`<n>The question is not quite as I have it. I am missing a comma for clarity in the question. I think the comma is required to avoid ambiguity. If I understood you correctly, it works like this. Mary has 112 stickets. I would want to ask how many does she have left because she has to use large and small stickers. The question as it stands uses a number as it is. I'd recommend making the large stickers not included in the count. That changes the statement to. "Mary has 112 sticker" followed by "she wants to keep at least 4 large and 8 small stickers on the page. She then wants the remainign 80 stickers to be used on other pages. How many stickers are left over?" The question does not ask how many stickers are left because she always uses 6 even if more are desired. She uses enough. I believe that the task is about what she can have left, so I would leave out any reference to 6 for each page except for the last page which can also have just 2 stickers.

Choices:  A: overpopulation B: birth C: presents D: propagation E: fun<n><n>### Response:		I guess the question is, do people even care? If anyone is able, and even if no one else is, who cares at this point? Is there any difference to a baby or child that is just born, whether its been "early", or after 39 weeks, for example? Just because there is no real difference, doesn't mean that the child's life is less valuable if it was born early, and in the event of need, a child could be born that was not intended. This situation should not even be that far out of line with many people thinking in terms of "might not be, if it happens", then in that case, it is a big deal, that has always been "a possibility". The one part I would rather not be a part of in the discussion, would be people who have decided against becoming parents, due to there being no choice "made", and they are not even the ones having to decide who will be born, but who will not... That doesn't sound like it's fair to me either.<n><n>### Input:"It was too hard so I had to give up" is most likely an example of ________."

That is not a bad excuse at all. There is no choice in the entire subject of someone's "unfortunately circumstance" other than to accept it, or not. Not everyone has what others have.<n><n>### Comments:<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: sailing vessel B: paddleboat C: ship D: motorboat E: tugboat<n><n>### Response:		I think that the correct answer is going to be the "helm" and the "mast." The helm is where you steer the boat, so the person that the helm is named after would have to work for it. The mast is where the sail is, so to control this position you need to move it with something to help you. This is where the helm is needed. I think that this is the answer to the question and you just need to change it to be a question, rather than a statement in the prompt.<n>### Input:Jared needs to make a 40 liter cooler to put into his ice chest.

Alice has three decks to sell, at $300 for the first deck, $250 for the second, and $200 for the third.  Alice is confident that everyone is willing to buy any number of decks given her price."  Choose the answer that best answers the question "Which decks will Alice sell and for how much?"   Choices: A:  Four decks for $800  B: Two decks for $450  C: Five decks for $1,250  D: Two decks for a total of $550  E: Three decks for $900 <n>### Response: To answer this question, you need to multiply the number of decks you can buy at the lowest price, by the number of decks.  Then you multiply this times the decks at the second highest price and the third price.  You then add these prices together.  The "queen of hearts" will only be able to sell 3 decks and they will cost $900 for all three.  As an extra answer you could combine 5 decks to cost $1800 or 6 decks at the third cost to cost $1850.<n><n>### Input"To make a salad, Melissa needs 17 cups of lettuce and 3 cups of carrots.

As the player that plays second base, I realized that I was the best player to be selected for that position. I stood up and put my hand on my heart, looked into Coach Tom's eyes, and said, "Yes, that will be me. Thank you, Coach Tom." I realized that by taking the bunt catcher position, I was going to be very busy, as each batter would have a chance to bunt. I knew that if I wasn't careful, I would be charged with an error each time a batter bunted. When it came time for the batter to bunt, I was very careful with each ball the batter hit at me, as the number one goal of the batter is to get on base. Before I knew it, I had made an error, but my teammates picked me up by hitting 5 home runs in the following inning.<n><n>### Input A: Describe you most memorable baseball moment.<n>### Demostration A: I had some of my family come out to witness my first start as a pitcher. I was nervous, which showed in the way that I was throwing the way I did. In my first at-bat, I was able to strike out the batter and my parents who were sitting on the opposite side of the dugout began applauding. That calmed me and made me focus on the next play. I was able to get a couple outs in my first inning of pitching and my teammates were cheering and my coach gave me signals that showed he was very pleased with my performance. I knew at that moment that playing baseball wasn’t just me. It’s our family.<n><n>### Response A<n><n>I'm still going with B<n><n><n>### Instructuin A:Answer one of the following questions.<n>### Input A : Choose something that scares you.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Mary had 89 stickers.  She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Answer: 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.

How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Answer: 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.

He buys a hat for $10 and a pencil for $2. Then he buys four cookies. If each cookie costs $1.25, how much money does Josh have left?<n>Answer: 3<n><n>### Input:The policemen wanted to clear the scene of the accident, so what did they do to traffic? Choices:  A: hurry along B: direct traffic C: help D: force open door E: corner thief<n><n>### Response:		<n>The policemen wanted to change the flow of traffic so that cars in the street were able to move quickly and safely.  If we look closely at the traffic at the scene of the accident by analyzing the direction in which cars are moving, we can see evidence of the police managing traffic.  Cars were moving quickly along the road, moving in a direction that was away from the scene of the accident.  This indicates that the police forced traffic to move along.<n><n>The policemen were trying to do a very important and difficult job.  They were clearing the scene of the accident so that the street could go back to normal.  When they were clearing traffic, the scene was very dangerous because cars were moving quickly and it was very easy for a crash to happen.  We can see how dangerous the scene of the accident was by analyzing the direction that the cars were moving.  The policemen wanted to help the cars in traffic by directing where they should go.<n><n>The police had the necessary equipment to help manage traffic.  One important piece of equipment was the stop sign the police officer held.  Using the stop sign, the police officer directed traffic by telling cars what to do.  Another tool the police had was a whistle.   The policemen used the whistle to communicate with vehicles and pedestrians.   By using a whistle to communicate, they were able to help quickly get the scene back to a safer situation.<n><n><n>### Input<n>Jill and Kate took ballet classes together. Jill took 1 class per week.

How many ballet classes does Kate take each week?<n><n>### Response<n>If we have some information that we can use to help us answer a question, we can make a guess and see if it works.  The first thing we must do is think of all the pieces of information that we can use:<n>The first thing we notice about this question is, for each individual class taken, the students add 1 to their total amount of classes taken.  Thus for Jill, the amount of classes taken increases by 12.  We also notice that Kate takes 3 times fewer classes.  Thus, we want to know the total amount of classes Kate takes.  We know

Choices:  A: graph B: bank at noon C: good book D: post office E: bus stop<n><n>### Response:		<n>In order to properly solve this problem, we have to first determine if any of our options are even logical.<n>For all of our choices, it is impossible for us to stand on a coat rack, or under a post office or a stop at a bus stop. This is because these choices are not applicable to the context of the question. This eliminates all choices but A and E.<n><n>### For our remaining two choices we evaluate the line itself. For our first option, we know that graph stands for chart. A chart, or graph, are graphic examples of data. Therefore, A means to stand in line, and need a coat if the data that is presented to us represents the weather as being a very cold.<n><n>Our second choice is Bank At Noon. We know that the bank will pay cash, not supplies. Therefore, we cannot be asked to stand in line to the bank. Therefore, our best guess at this point is to stand in the post office if we are told that it is cold outside. This is because, unlike the bank, the post office will pay cash, and there are a number of supplies at post offices that would warrant the use of a coat.

He buys a hat for $10 and a pencil for $2. Then he buys four cookies. If each cookie costs $1.25, how much money does Josh have left?<n>Answer: 3<n><n>### Input:What is the result of instituting civil action? Choices:  A: bad feelings B: confusion C: going to court D: hurt feelings E: sandwiches<n><n>### Response:		<n>During civil action, if no one was there to help stop the other person in the moment. Then in the next day or after the fact would have a long and drawn-out court proceedings. These court proceedings, could result in hurt feelings from all parties, and could go either way in the end. The end result is that civil proceedings are very very stressful and can be traumatizing.<n><n>### Inputs:<n>Criminal prosecution is a very different type of proceedings. Criminal prosecution is one person coming forward with a story from their point of view. Criminal proceedings almost always have eyewitness accounts that support the prosecution. Once the prosecution has their story laid out, the prosecution has to prove that the story is true by their evidence and testimony. The person on trial has a lawyer to defend his case and has the right to a jury of his peers. This is a process which often favors the state.<n><n>### Response<n>Civil proceedings are much more relaxed than criminal proceedings. Civil proceedings can be started and ended by a document which doesn’t necessarily have any supporting testimonials. There is much less emphasis placed on gathering evidence and witness statements. The defendant doesn’t have a lawyer, and no jury is involved. This results in civil prosecutions taking much less time.<n><n>### Tip:<n>Civil disputes are almost always small and involve relatively little damage. The court takes the complaint at face value without proof of any wrongdoing by the defendant and usually accepts the plaintiff's version as right.<n><n>### Intake:<n>While the rules and regulations used to determine whether a dispute is civil or criminal are not always 100% foolproof, there are some solid signs and characteristics of civil or criminal proceedings. If the proceedings are usually civil, that case will probably be civil. If someone has been arrested, that will probably be criminal.<n><n>### Output:<n>Not all civil cases are civil cases. In most civil cases, people will agree on the resolution prior to the proceedings. This is not always the case however: If a lawsuit is issued over a debt issue, the judge might order a sale of the defendant property to compensate for the debt. This is actually a criminal offense, and

Choices:  A: feel sorry B: trust god C: cross street D: ride a bike E: lend money<n><n>### Response:		<n>Your question is unclear.  For example, you don't say if the person hurt someone else or did the hurt himself. Another example -- did the person hurt or kill someone?

Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?, Choices:  A: better communication B: overthinking C: frustration D: misunderstandings E: headaches<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>### Explanation:<n>The right answer cannot be E or A.  B, C, and D do not explain why learning a new language is difficult.  Only B explains that this difficulty will cause frustration, A explains that this difficulty will lead to poor communications, C explains that this difficulty will make people think too hard about what they're saying, and D explains that this difficulty will create misunderstandings.<n><n>### Input<n>You can't see the water in a kiddie pool when it's filled with water. Explain why you don't see the water when the pool is full.<n><n>### Response<n>The object that is placed inside of a container that can hold liquids is not seen from the outside.  The water, which fills the kiddie pool, is a liquid and is therefore transparent.  Because the water is transparent it cannot be seen by anyone who is looking into the kiddie pool.<n><n>### Implementation<n><n>Write a code segment that can answer the question below:<n><n>**Input:** If a kiddie pool is filled with water, an object is placed inside, and you then look into the kiddie<n>pool, you will not see the object.<n><n>**Output:** Why?<n><n>### Solution from a Tutor in response to above<n><n>1. The object cannot be seen because all of the water is in front of the object.<n>2. Water is transparent, this allows you to see through water and see the object in front of it.<n>3. If the water were filled with non-transparent objects (i.e. balls or marbles) you would not see through the objects to the object in front of them.<n>4. The liquid fills up the kiddie pool preventing you from seeing the object. This shows that there are different liquids.<n><n>### Discussion<n><n>**Note that the student does not describe each of the 4 reasons separately.**  They use them all together.  The way that they have written the code segment they just give the reasons on a new line like so:<n>`Answer: The object cannot be seen  Because all of the water is standing in the way in front of the object`, so on and so forth.  A Tutor said the following and I completely agree.<n><n>The solution is good because it explains all of the reasons in one sentence

She does not have an adequate roller, so she will have to buy one. She will need paint for the trim, floors and wainscotting. Also, each room needs something different, so she must buy paint by the square foot. She also has 4 rooms in the house, plus she still needs to do the hallway. If she is doing all this work, she is going to need tools. She is going to have to buy a drill, a stud finder, a paint scraper, a sand paper, a paint strainer and a lot of plastic sheets. She is going to need buckets of plaster, white out and a brush.<n><n>### Input(2):<n><n>### Response(2):<n><n>The answer is 653.00<n><n>A: She has 4 rollers so she needs to buy 1.<n><n>B: She has 4 rooms that need to be painted each in their own way so she needs 4 paint bucket<n><n>C: Each room is 500 sq ft so she needs 662 pieces of paint<n><n>D: She needs tools: 1 drill, 1 stud finder, 1 paint scraper, 1 sandpaper roll, 1 paint strainer, and 1 brush.<n><n>The answer is $653.086<n><n>I was using the following formula to solve each of the problems.<n>(Rollers) x (rooms) x(square footage)<n>For rollers I chose to add 4 because there are four rooms and since she will need to paint down to the trim, etc. So 4 rollers will be needed.<n>For rooms I chose to add 9 because she is including 4 rooms and a hallway and bathroom. So it is going to be 4 rooms and 662 pieces. The bathroom will be 400 sf and the hallway will be 440 sf. The living room and bedroom will be 370 each and the kitchen will be 80.

Choices:  A: classroom B: toy store C: school D: soccer game E: dinner<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Choose the interesting and exciting toys at the toy store to spend a day of fun. If you get to meet up with friends for the soccer game it will be a lot easier to make new friends and get to know about them better. If you’re hungry, go to the soccer game for dinner instead of taking a toy, because that is a good option too. The worst place to go is the classroom. You might learn something and gain your interest, or you might get bored really fast. The toy store, soccer game and dinner are more interesting than the classroom because you can always go home and do homework or if you don’t have anything to do you can go online or play video games. The best choice is the soccer game, which is a great excuse for friends to bond more and spend more time together before leaving. Then, when you’re there make more friends and try to ask all of them about their birthday, because that might be a great option to go out with them on Saturday or the weekend of their birthday and talk some more, and maybe even make plans for school and play together when you get home. Finally, it gets better by telling them what you thought, about their birthdays, and try to ask them about themselves, and what interests they have.<n><n>### Input<n>If you had these ingredients what would you cook?<n><n>Potatoes, milk, eggs, cheese, bread, salt, onions, carrots, butter, parsley<n><n>### Response<n><n>I think I would make some baked potato bites.

She used 3 large stickers on the front page of her journal and 7 stickers each to 6 other pages of her journal. How many stickers does Mary have remaining?<n>Answer: 44<n><n>Input: Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?<n>Answer: 6<n><n>Input: Mark has kangaroos and goats.  Kangaroos have two legs and goats have four legs.  If he has 23 kangaroos and three times as many goats as kangaroos what is the total number of legs of all his animals?<n>Answer: 322<n><n>Input: Josh’s mom gives him $20 to go shopping at the mall. He buys a hat for $10 and a pencil for $2. Then he buys four cookies. If each cookie costs $1.25, how much money does Josh have left?<n>Answer: 3<n><n>### Input:What would humans do when their legs are tired? Choices:  A: sit down B: make mistakes C: have sex D: reproduce E: excrete<n><n>### Response:		<n>My response to this question is option D: reproduce. When the legs are tired they will need to reproduce so that they can travel more easily. I found this from a research called "The Case of the Legless Frogs". Where they studied frogs and after they were cut off from their legs from the waste down, the frogs grow new legs. They did this because their legs were tired and couldn't have legs anymore since they were lost. So they could't walk around like they normally used to. Instead of this they choose to grow their legs again because they didn't want to stop walking around and they wanted to reproduce and travel around to find the right mate. This is why I think they do this because they want to reproduce more to live their life. This also supports what the researchers found because it proves that my answer, that is to reproduce their legs, is what humans would do to their legs to live their life.<n><n>### Challenge<n>- [Research the concept of "biological" and "chemical reproduction".

Choices:  A: builders B: driver C: architect D: fall down E: tradesmen<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is **D**.<n><n>1. **1. Who designs a building?**<n><n>    Building designers must understand physics and have knowledge of construction techniques to create structures that are safe and stand the test of time. Although a building is ultimately owned by someone else, the architect is the single owner of the design. Architects must be able to communicate design ideas and work with other building designers, such as draftspeople, contractors, and engineers.<n><n>1. Architects are educated and trained to design structures that must be safe, comfortable, and functional, with attention to aesthetics. They use various design materials, including wood, steel, glass, light, texture, and sound, as well as technology. The buildings they create may be complex and diverse, involving a variety of elements.<n>1. Architectural design teams range from one to many, depending on the scale and scope of the project and the individual architect's capacity or preferences. The architects' task is to understand, envision, and communicate design ideas. They then work together with subcontractors, such as interior designers, engineers, and contractors who can make the building a reality. Architects typically work on one or more projects at a time.<n>1. Archetects are designers. <n><n>### Input:(Please choose the correct answer from the choices provided.)A: builders B: fall down C: driver D: architect E: tradesmen10. The people whose job it is to make sure all the workers follow the building codes and regulations are the (A: engineer B: architect C: builder D: contractor E: project manager) <n><n>1. **9.**The people whose job it is<n><n>    to make sure all the worker follow the building codes and the regulations are the<n><n>    building inspectors.<n><n>1. Building inspectors ensure that buildings are built safely. They make ongoing inspections to make sure construction workers are meeting regulations and standards. They also make sure a building is up to code and can provide adequate fire protection. Building inspectors work in the city or county government or with private organizations. Some inspectors work for building code officials.<n><n>1. They check building locations to make sure a structure isn't placed in flood zones.<n><n>1. Inspections require the inspector to examine different parts

Choices:  A: vessel B: box C: transistor D: submarine E: lamp<n><n>### Response:		Choice A: vessel<n><n>### Instructions:Write a short response that completes the request. Your response should answer the question.<n><n>## Response:<n>A satellite is able to be  in orbit over a given location.  This is because it rotates through the earths atmosphere at such a high speed that it is able to pass over the earth's equator without friction. It also is moving at a high speed, about 7,000 mph.  This is also the reason that it is able to pick up the voice signals of any location.  A transponder (the device) picks up the voice signals of a radio broadcast, and then it is translated into another frequency wave, and then that is transmitted to the satellite, which then re-broadcasts this information to the desired receiving station or location.  Because the satellite is moving, it's picking up the station's signal, and then bouncing it back to the receiving station.<n><n>### Reference:<n><n>[Reference](https://www.livescience.com/72389-how-satellites-work.html)

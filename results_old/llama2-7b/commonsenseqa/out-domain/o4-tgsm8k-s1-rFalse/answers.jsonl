I would work on the first set afterwards.\n\n### Answer \n\nThe answer is 55\n\n### Input  \n\nMary is playing catch with her dog, and her boyfriend, and her neighbor, and her mom, and her neighbor's uncle who is visiting.  She is keeping track of who is getting the catch on what number so that she can keep score.  So, how many catches on what number from one to nine is Mary keeping track of, without the number 1?\n\n### Outcome \n\nThe outcome is that the number 5 is not included in a catching position for Mary. The outcome would also be that Mary is using numbers up to 9 with the catching position.\n\n### Reason \n\nThe reason is because Mary does not catch the ball on her own side.\n\n### Final out\nThe final out is that there is one person, including Mary, who catches the ball.  \n\n### Input and output \n \nThe input is that one of the numbers for catches is 8.  The output is that Mary does not catch the toss back from her neighbor's uncle.\n\n### How and explain your reasoning and then ask me a question.\n \nFor the last question, I would use a two digit number (16) plus two one-digit numbers (two and twelve) to get twenty-eight.\n\n### What if?  \n \nWhat if I changed the input of the last question from eight to 8?  Would my answer be different?\n\n### What did you learn from this and now you can teach or explain to me what you learned?\n \nI learned that I had to change the input to 8 so the output was the number 28.\n\n### Exact same thing in the last question.", "answer": "C: party"}

{"text": "Option A: Pain - When an athlete gets injured and feels pain, that could be the reason why he/she couldn't compete in a sport, especially if the injury was serious enough. If it affected only the muscles or the tendons and they hurt while throwing, running, jumping, hitting or doing stretching exercises it can be really difficult to take part in some of games.\n\nOption B. Mudslide - It happens when a player slips on the mud that appears on the ground. This situation is very dangerous, but it's very rare.\n\nOption C. Sweating - If there is a heavy rainfall or a very warm climate during the game this can lead to serious sweating and this sweating can cause more serious conditions like dehydration and dizziness which can seriously affect sport performance and can cause even death.\n\nOption D. Injuries - Injuries are serious or light physical injuries which can be caused by different physical accidents, some types of muscule tension, strain and pain. Different kinds of sports can cause different sports injuries that can occur at any moment, like slipping on a spot of ice, falling on the field, banging your head during the game etc. Injuries can be very serious, cause some big health consequences, require serious surgeries and long period rehabilitation.\n\nOption E. Rain - In some situations, rain will be a really good weather situation, especially in warm areas and deserts, due to the fact that rain in such conditions can cause big sporting competitions like rainy athletics and rainy marathons. Otherwise it can seriously influence bad sport performance, when playing sports outside. To be more specific, water drops that appear on the field or on the pitch can cause serious damage to the sporting equipment, especially when they are metallic. This can be pretty tricky when throwing an iron thing in a direction of rain drops.", "answer": "D: injuries"}

{"text": "Answer  \"E\"\n\n### Instructions:In the text below, a task is described. Write a response that completes the task.\nInput: A group of students are creating a plan to get ready for a local science fair. They all know that it takes a minimum of six weeks to build a working model which includes testing the model against an unknown goal condition. They have a total of 12 weeks before the science fair and they decide to work in pairs as to not make their group plan. \nThey have $80 and each pair is to use it to build an egg drop device that will protect an egg from falling 10 feet once it is dropped.  The eggs are not included in the cost and have to be purchased at the local grocery store. They decide to have one item that costs five cents. They want to buy 20 items that total five cents so there is ten cents worth of items per person in the pair to make a total of $2.50. \nThey also want to have one item that is fifty cents so there is $35 in total for the two people to use, not including the cost of the eggs. The items that cost five cents are for the eggs because the group has determined that an egg is the minimum amount that is needed for them to perform their task.  They decide to start by finding out how long it will take them to make the item that costs fifty cents. They begin with three paper towels which costs 10 cents. Two paper towels costs 50 cents. \nEach person in the pair needs to pay ten cents for their item. They can use two paper towels, three paper napkins and one paper towel for 60 cents so to add 10 more paper towels would cost 60 cents.  One person can buy the items that are fifty cents for fifty cents while the other person can buy one item that costs five hundred dollars and one item that costs 75 cents. They spend too little time for their task so they decide to make one item that costs 25 cents for the rest of their supplies.\n\n### Input\nAnswer: Two people will cost you $4.  The person that has five hundred dollars and the person that has $4 can give away their $4 to the person that is buying one item", "answer": "B: cemetary"}
{"text": "In order to be able to answer this question and provide feedback to the question, it is important to first understand the context and specifications of the question. By doing so, we can then determine which answer choice is the most plausible and reasonable. One aspect of the question that can help to narrow down the possible answers is that it specifies that the object in question must be \u201clarge\u201d and \u201cmany\u201d. This suggests that the object in question may be a large structure or place, such as a building, park, or other public area. Based on these constraints, some of the answer choices seem less likely than others. Choice A states that a church could have hundreds of statues. While churches may have a number of statues, it is unlikely that all of them would be visible at one time. Similarly, choice B would be unlikely to have thousands of statues due to its use for entertainment. Choices C and D both refer to central parks, which may have numerous statues, but they would not likely all be visible at once. The remaining choice, E, indicates a large city, which likely has a variety of buildings and statues spread out across the city. As such, this provides the most plausible context for the question, and the answer choice that provides the most likely match would be choice E.\n\n### Input:`Ali baked 42 muffins`\n\n### Response:`How many muffins did she bake`\n\n### Input:\"Darwin and I worked on this project for 3 weeks.\"\n\n### Response:\"Who worked on this project?\"\n\n### Input\"Their homework is due\"\n\n### Response`The homework is done by`\n\n### Below are sentences from the play WE ARE PRESENTING ON OUR READING OF THE PLAY AND DISCUSSION.\n\n### Sentence: There will be other monopoly games after these, of course.\n\n### There is an applause after this sentence.\n\n### Below is an instruction that describe a task.

B. children were more active in their communities than teenagers.\n### C. children had more chores to do.  D. children spent more time working.\n\n### Response (1):\n\nBecause in the second paragraph, the phrase \u201cmore active in their communities\u201d tells me that children are outgoing and sociable. That is different from the first paragraph, because in the first paragraph, there is an expression which says \u201cmore prone to distraction\u201d which means that children are not interested in school. They just do random things they can\u2019t focus on learning; they just spend less time in the school environment, they seem to be more like a teenager. \n\nInput (2):\n\nBecause the first paragraph talks about parents and teachers think that school should be reformed to meet what children need, but the second paragraph talks about school don\u2019t have a place for children.

{"text": "If you slowly grill food, you are using a barbeque. To grill food slowly in a backyard would be a barbeque but this is unlikely to be called as such by anyone I'm sure, nor would it likely be referred to as a grill. Instead, your friends may use a grill or even a barbecue to roast meat over an open flame in your backyard. However, the word barbeque is most commonly associated with cooking food very gently so as to allow the flavors to permeate and develop. This is the term used when one barbeques meats, vegetables, and many other foods at a low temperature and for a long time so as to develop the flavors of the foods being roasted. In barbequing, one typically cooks food slowly and on a low heat so as to let the flavors come out in the food. In contrast, in grilling one sears or chars one\u2019s meat quickly and high on a grill, often using oils to prevent the meat from sticking to the grill.[1] According to Wikipedia\u2019s article on barbequing, the word barbequing is not used in everyday colloquial speech. Because of this, one could not say that in barbequing you slowly grill the food. Barbequing is specifically a method of cooking food slowly and often on a grill, using flavors of various foods (oils, sauces, marinades) to develop over time. Thus when you roast anything with a grill, it is called grilling, not barbequing because it is not being slow cooked but it is being charred on a flame.[2] I could not agree more, as what they are saying is true. When using a grill, food is being roasted slowly over a fire. This has been termed grilling, not barbecuing. Therefore, when one uses a grill to roast meat, the common term used is grilling, not barbie queuing.\n\n### D: Mary has 89 stickers that she is using to decorate her journal.

I don't mean that you are not giving good tasks, I mean that the wrong answer has nothing in the passage that points to it and the correct answer has evidence in the passage.\n\n### How to Improve\n\n#### I don't really have much room to improve my task given the information I am using. I do recommend making the first part a little easier because a student without experience finding the right answer in multiple choice may assume that there is only one way to get there. I will make one correction at this time which is in item #5:\n\n`### Input: Mary had 112 stickers.

How many sticker is left over that don\u2019t meet these requirements?`\nThe question is not quite as I have it. I am missing a comma for clarity in the question. I think the comma is required to avoid ambiguity. If I understood you correctly, it works like this. Mary has 112 stickets. I would want to ask how many does she have left because she has to use large and small stickers. The question as it stands uses a number as it is. I'd recommend making the large stickers not included in the count. That changes the statement to. \"Mary has 112 sticker\" followed by \"she wants to keep at least 4 large and 8 small stickers on the page. She then wants the remainign 80 stickers to be used on other pages. How many stickers are left over?\" The question does not ask how many stickers are left because she always uses 6 even if more are desired. She uses enough. I believe that the task is about what she can have left, so I would leave out any reference to 6 for each page except for the last page which can also have just 2 stickers.

Alice has three decks to sell, at $300 for the first deck, $250 for the second, and $200 for the third.  Alice is confident that everyone is willing to buy any number of decks given her price.\"  Choose the answer that best answers the question \"Which decks will Alice sell and for how much?\"   Choices: A:  Four decks for $800  B: Two decks for $450  C: Five decks for $1,250  D: Two decks for a total of $550  E: Three decks for $900 \n### Response: To answer this question, you need to multiply the number of decks you can buy at the lowest price, by the number of decks.  Then you multiply this times the decks at the second highest price and the third price.  You then add these prices together.  The \"queen of hearts\" will only be able to sell 3 decks and they will cost $900 for all three.  As an extra answer you could combine 5 decks to cost $1800 or 6 decks at the third cost to cost $1850.\n\n### Input\"To make a salad, Melissa needs 17 cups of lettuce and 3 cups of carrots.

{"text": "The policemen wanted to change the flow of traffic so that cars in the street were able to move quickly and safely.  If we look closely at the traffic at the scene of the accident by analyzing the direction in which cars are moving, we can see evidence of the police managing traffic.  Cars were moving quickly along the road, moving in a direction that was away from the scene of the accident.  This indicates that the police forced traffic to move along.\n\nThe policemen were trying to do a very important and difficult job.  They were clearing the scene of the accident so that the street could go back to normal.  When they were clearing traffic, the scene was very dangerous because cars were moving quickly and it was very easy for a crash to happen.  We can see how dangerous the scene of the accident was by analyzing the direction that the cars were moving.  The policemen wanted to help the cars in traffic by directing where they should go.\n\nThe police had the necessary equipment to help manage traffic.  One important piece of equipment was the stop sign the police officer held.  Using the stop sign, the police officer directed traffic by telling cars what to do.  Another tool the police had was a whistle.   The policemen used the whistle to communicate with vehicles and pedestrians.   By using a whistle to communicate, they were able to help quickly get the scene back to a safer situation.\n\n\n### Input\nJill and Kate took ballet classes together. Jill took 1 class per week.  She took 12 ballet classes in total. Kate took 2 ballet classes with Jill. Kate took 3 times as many ballet classes as Jill. How many ballet classes does Kate take each week?\n\n### Response\nIf we have some information that we can use to help us answer a question, we can make a guess and see if it works.  The first thing we must do is think of all the pieces of information that we can use:\nThe first thing we notice about this question is, for each individual class taken, the students add 1 to their total amount of classes taken.  Thus for Jill, the amount of classes taken increases by 12.  We also notice that Kate takes 3 times fewer classes.  Thus, we want to know the total amount of classes Kate takes.

Once the prosecution has their story laid out, the prosecution has to prove that the story is true by their evidence and testimony. The person on trial has a lawyer to defend his case and has the right to a jury of his peers. This is a process which often favors the state.\n\n### Response\nCivil proceedings are much more relaxed than criminal proceedings. Civil proceedings can be started and ended by a document which doesn\u2019t necessarily have any supporting testimonials. There is much less emphasis placed on gathering evidence and witness statements. The defendant doesn\u2019t have a lawyer, and no jury is involved. This results in civil prosecutions taking much less time.\n\n### Tip:\nCivil disputes are almost always small and involve relatively little damage. The court takes the complaint at face value without proof of any wrongdoing by the defendant and usually accepts the plaintiff's version as right.\n\n### Intake:\nWhile the rules and regulations used to determine whether a dispute is civil or criminal are not always 100% foolproof, there are some solid signs and characteristics of civil or criminal proceedings. If the proceedings are usually civil, that case will probably be civil. If someone has been arrested, that will probably be criminal.\n\n### Output:\nNot all civil cases are civil cases. In most civil cases, people will agree on the resolution prior to the proceedings. This is not always the case however: If a lawsuit is issued over a debt issue, the judge might order a sale of the defendant property to compensate for the debt. This is actually a criminal offense, and", "answer": "C: going to court"}

Only B explains that this difficulty will cause frustration, A explains that this difficulty will lead to poor communications, C explains that this difficulty will make people think too hard about what they're saying, and D explains that this difficulty will create misunderstandings.\n\n### Input\nYou can't see the water in a kiddie pool when it's filled with water. Explain why you don't see the water when the pool is full.\n\n### Response\nThe object that is placed inside of a container that can hold liquids is not seen from the outside.  The water, which fills the kiddie pool, is a liquid and is therefore transparent.  Because the water is transparent it cannot be seen by anyone who is looking into the kiddie pool.\n\n### Implementation\n\nWrite a code segment that can answer the question below:\n\n**Input:** If a kiddie pool is filled with water, an object is placed inside, and you then look into the kiddie\npool, you will not see the object.\n\n**Output:** Why?\n\n### Solution from a Tutor in response to above\n\n1. The object cannot be seen because all of the water is in front of the object.\n2. Water is transparent, this allows you to see through water and see the object in front of it.\n3. If the water were filled with non-transparent objects (i.e. balls or marbles) you would not see through the objects to the object in front of them.\n4. The liquid fills up the kiddie pool preventing you from seeing the object. This shows that there are different liquids.\n\n### Discussion\n\n**Note that the student does not describe each of the 4 reasons separately.**  They use them all together.  The way that they have written the code segment they just give the reasons on a new line like so:\n`Answer: The object cannot be seen  Because all of the water is standing in the way in front of the object`, so on and so forth.

{"text": "My response to this question is option D: reproduce. When the legs are tired they will need to reproduce so that they can travel more easily. I found this from a research called \"The Case of the Legless Frogs\". Where they studied frogs and after they were cut off from their legs from the waste down, the frogs grow new legs. They did this because their legs were tired and couldn't have legs anymore since they were lost. So they could't walk around like they normally used to. Instead of this they choose to grow their legs again because they didn't want to stop walking around and they wanted to reproduce and travel around to find the right mate. This is why I think they do this because they want to reproduce more to live their life. This also supports what the researchers found because it proves that my answer, that is to reproduce their legs, is what humans would do to their legs to live their life.\n\n### Challenge\n- [Research the concept of \"biological\" and \"chemical reproduction\".

{"text": "The correct answer is **D**.\n\n1. **1. Who designs a building?**\n\n    Building designers must understand physics and have knowledge of construction techniques to create structures that are safe and stand the test of time. Although a building is ultimately owned by someone else, the architect is the single owner of the design. Architects must be able to communicate design ideas and work with other building designers, such as draftspeople, contractors, and engineers.\n\n1. Architects are educated and trained to design structures that must be safe, comfortable, and functional, with attention to aesthetics. They use various design materials, including wood, steel, glass, light, texture, and sound, as well as technology. The buildings they create may be complex and diverse, involving a variety of elements.\n1. Architectural design teams range from one to many, depending on the scale and scope of the project and the individual architect's capacity or preferences. The architects' task is to understand, envision, and communicate design ideas. They then work together with subcontractors, such as interior designers, engineers, and contractors who can make the building a reality. Architects typically work on one or more projects at a time.\n1. Archetects are designers. \n\n### Input:(Please choose the correct answer from the choices provided.)A: builders B: fall down C: driver D: architect E: tradesmen10. The people whose job it is to make sure all the workers follow the building codes and regulations are the (A: engineer B: architect C: builder D: contractor E: project manager) \n\n1. **9.**The people whose job it is\n\n    to make sure all the worker follow the building codes and the regulations are the\n\n    building inspectors.\n\n1. Building inspectors ensure that buildings are built safely. They make ongoing inspections to make sure construction workers are meeting regulations and standards. They also make sure a building is up to code and can provide adequate fire protection. Building inspectors work in the city or county government or with private organizations. Some inspectors work for building code officials.\n\n1. They check building locations to make sure a structure isn't placed in flood zones.\n\n1. Inspections require the inspector to examine different parts", "answer": "C: architect"}

This is because it rotates through the earths atmosphere at such a high speed that it is able to pass over the earth's equator without friction. It also is moving at a high speed, about 7,000 mph.  This is also the reason that it is able to pick up the voice signals of any location.  A transponder (the device) picks up the voice signals of a radio broadcast, and then it is translated into another frequency wave, and then that is transmitted to the satellite, which then re-broadcasts this information to the desired receiving station or location.

The only person there that is sick is the person in the hospital so he has to answer B.\n\n### Answer (by 66c0d360@gmail.com):\nB since a sick person is always in a hospital and since a doctor's office is filled with sick people he could contract an illness, but it's the sickest who is the most vulnerable to diseases due to weakened immune systems caused by the illness, but if you're healthy you're not contracting the illness.\n\n### Input\nA man is purchasing a book for a class. He has to have the book before Friday, March 8. He plans on buying the book Monday, March 4.  If the book is $50 and there is a 10% discount, what is the best price he can buy the book?\n\n\n#### 47.3\n\nRationales: Discounts = discount rate*original rate.\nBecause the original rate was $50, the discount rate of 10% means that the discount is the product of 10% and the original rate.\nDiscount rate 10% = 10cents/dollar\nDiscount = 10% * 50\n10% discount = 10% of  50 = 0.5 of 50 = $25\n\nSale price is the original price minus the discount. Sale price = 50 - 25 = $25\n#### 47\n\nAnswer: A sale price was $25.\n\n### Response\nThe best price to buy a book at the 10% discout from the original price is Sale price = $50 - 20 % (1/10) = 50 - $5 = $25 or 47.3% in a word.\n\n### Question\nTommy pays $0", "answer": "D: elderly person"}

(For example, how much would the average employee that is 30 work out to versus how much that person should make if they had a degree? In other words, is the average person going to make say, $30,000 dollars in their 30th year? Or should they be making say, $100,000 because they have a degree?

A freight train is different from a passenger train in that is that a passenger train always has more than one freight car. \n\nTo solve this problem we have to find the distance of 48km/hr and divide it by the speed of the train which is 4m /s.\n\n48m divide/divide by 4\n\nThen we would say\n\nRatio: 12 to 4\n\n4 m /s * 12\n\nWe can then say 50m /s which is the distance moved by every second.\n\n\nWe are then left with a ratio 158m to x\n\nWe can then simply solve by finding the missing x.\n\n8 = x\n\nThen from here we can say that 14 units of this train are 80m\n\n158m - 146m\n\n\n\nWe are left with the value of x\n\nWe can say 12\n\nThe missing distance =48\n\n### Input; Given that 2n2  and 632, which of the following is the value of n.\n\n### Answer: 2\n\n### Rational: A number raised to the second power is known as square root of that number.

It is to increase taxes on essential goods so people can\u2019t afford to consume a lot of necessary items. This can also solve the unemployment problem. Government can also change the monetary policy to control inflation by lowering money supply so people don\u2019t borrow as much. It is also important to maintain the balance between fiscal and monetary policies. Otherwise, the inflation could create a vicious circle. People will have more money, increasing inflation rates, and prices for goods will rise, causing them to have more money even more. Government also need to increase productive capacity by investing on new technology, investing on infrastructure improvement and rebuilding infrastructures that were destroyed by natural disaster and provide people with jobs.\n\nFinally, government needs to control speculation in the economy by limiting the trading in securities and controlling of prices on commodities. It can be done by regulating of futures exchange.\u201d}\n\n### Input:`You have a 100 gram bag of sugar. A friend wants to borrow 6 gram of sugar.

However, I think the more effective way to critique these texts is to write a letter to the author's primary audience. This will be the reader, and they will definitely be different from the author.

Many lives were lost and people were scared. I can tell by the word choice in your text that you are scared for your life. I can only imagine the suffering and death that you have witnessed. In a time like this I think everyone is scared because they know that it could quickly take their life. It's important for people reading this message that you are writing anonymously that it wasn't your place to mention the names of the dead but it's really important for you to write about the fact that so many people are dead because of this plague. \"When the corpses are carried to be buried you see some that die a second time on the way, and many others are carried out that seem to be alive, and in the course of a few days they die.\" When you wrote this it wasn't the time or place for the names of the dead to be put out there in the world. But what you did do was put an entire idea of what the plague was doing to your town. You put out the idea that so many people are dying, and it wasn't because God was angry with me.\n\n\nThis is the reason I think a reader at the time you were writing would have felt comforted by what you said in", "answer": "C: marriage"}

The roof leaks.  She decides that the best solution is to spend $1200.00 on a new roof.  Each hour of labor costs $73.07 and each roll of tar costs $6.32.  She lives alone and prefers to spend no more than one hour per day working on the roof.  It will rain for one week out of each month.  If she doesn't want to work or repair the roof in the rain, how many months of the year should it rain in order to spend no more than $2050.20 on the new roof?\n\n### Rationales:For one hour, a woman can either work on a roll of tar, or she can work on tar for one hour and then replace a roll of tar.  So one woman can either:  (work for an hour to replace a tar roll).  Or: (work on either a roll of tar for one hour, or replace a roll of tar).  Let's call the woman's work \"r\"\n\n### R: One whole day's worth of work includes:  r time, plus:  r time for tar, plus: T tar.  So 1 day\u2019s work is equal to:  r, plus: r for T, plus:T\n\n### Let: (time) equal to: t - to make it easier on the arithmetic\n\n### 1 week of rain for an entire month = 12 weeks.\n### $2050 = r + t, or\n### r + t = $2050\n\n### By setting r+t = $205, we can also write:\n### $2750 =", "answer": "E: urinate"}

{"text": "The correct answer is : Exotic snakes are selling like hotcakes, which is why prices are rising.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn order to understand the current market of exotic snakes, one must look at the 4 main factors, which are price, quantity, demand and supply.\n\nIn this case, we are dealing with an increase in price of exotic snakes caused by an increase in demand.\nThis is known as a market failure, which is a circumstance that leads to an inefficient market, where the price of the good is higher than under a situation of perfect competition.\n\nThe law of supply and demand states that in a free market, when the price of a good or service rises, an extra quantity will be offered for sale, and when the price falls, quantity demanded will rise.\n\nIn this current market it looks as if the price has increased, in terms of snake owners who are now willing to pay more money to buy these snakes. This could be because snake owners want to show off their snakes by buying accessories for the snakes such as exotic cages, this could mean that there is an increase in the quantity demanded for these goods and services and an increase in price.\n\nBecause there is an increase in demand, the quantity supplied will decrease. With 6 exotic snakes remaining up for grabs, the owners who previously sold their snakes at 300 could decide to increase their price to over 300 now that demand is higher and the quantity supplied falls, meaning now that there are more people competing to own the exotic snakes they are willing to pay more and more, therefore the price of the 6 snakes has increased from 300, to 312.50.\n\n### Rationales:\n\nWith respects to an equation, the law of supply is represented by the equation price=f(s), and represents the inverse of inverse of price=/ 1\\(d\\) and represents the inverse of the law demand.\nIn an increase in price, the quantity demanded would decrease. An increase in price would not necessarily cause a shift in demand. It would need to be a shift in the market price.

I then store the rice in my closet on the floor.  Each bag is 6 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 14 inches tall.  If I were able to store the rice in the closet, I would have an additional 6*12*14 / 55 = <<6*12*24/55=1>>12.65% of my available space for storage.  How many pounds of rice could I store at the maximum allowed by my closet?\n\n### Rationale:There are 4.82 percent remaining.\n\n1 remains.\n\n55 / 55+1 = 54 / 55+2 = 54 / (55+2) = 54 * 55 / ((55+2)*2) = 2.9*54 * 54 = 141.76,\nthen round to the nearest whole number.\nThus, it can hold 141 pounds.", "answer": "D: connecticut"}

Hope this helps.\n\nAnswer: This is a good practice for debugging your code. You are using the wrong syntax for your code.\n\nFirstly,  there is no need to write your function in an outer function. Also, function body should always have a bracket `{}`. The 2nd and 3rd line should be:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef answerQuestion():\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: The function will find which of your answer is correct according to given question and instructions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Write this: instructionAnswer = (\"Input Question here, example:\")\n\n    instructionAnswer = \"\"\"\n    input: The car-renting agency charges $32/day for a car and $15 for the first week for rental that last over 7 days.

I highly suggest you to look through basic python functions [here](https://www.javatpoint.com/python-functions)\n\nComment: I tried it and now I get a syntax error. The first time I tried it, the function was empty, and therefore an error was returned. Is there somewhere it is telling me the syntax line is wrong?

What does the charge for a purchase of $24, exactly on the $15 line? Round your answer to the nearest cent.\nRationales:\n1. When the purchase under $5 is $5 the cost is $18. So to get an exact answer we subtract $5+$18 by $13 giving us 5+18-13.\n2. If the purchase of $24 is at least $5, you must multiply it by.3 (30%): 9(24) is 124+9=133.\n3.

{"text": "A\n\n### Rationale:\nI think the answer is A, because according to the definition of workman's compensations:  _(Web Defenition)_  is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employee's right to sue his or her employer for the tort of negligence.  Workers' compensation may also provide rehabilitation services.\n```\nThere's an example on the website below:\n\nA carpenter in Missouri was helping paint a roof repair.  His employer paid him a per day-rate for everyday that he worked.  He fell off the roof and suffered personal injury.  His employer would not make future payments to him because it found he had misrepresented his health in applying for work.  It turned out that the employer had obtained workers' compensation insurance to pay for worker's benefits but hadn't paid its policy premiums for that insurance.  There's nothing in workers' compensation law that prevented the employer from terminating the worker, but if the worker had brought an action for negligence against the employer, it was required to purchase insurance to cover that tort.  Since Missouri has compulsory workers' compensation, it must make all necessary insurance payments.\n```\nAccording to this example, workman's compensaton is paid in the factory of an apprentice.\n```\nIn Workman's Compensation - Construction Industry, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to carry workers' compensation insurace for all employees, as long as three or more are employed anywhere, or they are employed as domestic service workers in private homes.\n```\nSo the answer must be A, because the guy tripped over a metal-rod on the building (factory) and he was injured. \n\n### Credits:\nI watched Youtube video to know the answer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIyM0Duq1Fc\n\n### Link:https://www.youtube.c", "answer": "B: construction site"}

{"text": "The answer, A. You can't have a pet in the wild.\n\nInput: A blowfish lives free.  He lives on his own with his own blowfish friends and blowfish cousins.  They feed on tiny snails and crustaceans.  Every day they like to have a blowfish party.  Where does he live?  Choices:  A) fish market, B) pet shop, C) great outdoors, D) river, E) the little mermaid\nRationales: We know that the blowfish lives with other blowfish as well as his own cousins.  The only place this could happen is if the blowfish is a pet in somebody\u2019s household.  The blowfish might go to the fish market to get supplies, but would hardly be able to stay there for an extended time without being sold.  In the fish market, he would have to stay by himself or with the other blowfish that the owner had purchased at the fish market.  The owner would give this blowfish the only option of staying with other blowfish so it is a family of blowfish.\n\nThe owner wouldn\u2019t take the blowfish outside of the pet store to the great outdoors.  The blowfish wouldn\u2019t know how to stay or care for itself at all.\nIn the river, the blowfish would be exposed to the various sea critters, including mermaids, which would most likely eat it.  In the great outdoors, the blowfish would likely become an extinct species due to pollution, pesticides, and other things of that nature. We also know the blowfish has cousins of its own.  They should be of the same blood, and thus have the same needs for food and water, as well as living space.\n\nThe only place the blowfish can live is in a fish tank.  Therefore, only if the blowfish\u2019s environment is managed appropriately will he be able to successfully survive and make it to adulthood.  The blowfish must live in its own tank and with its cousins so that they can provide the appropriate enclosure.\n\nThe most appropriate choice is A.\n\nAnswer: A\n\n### Input\nA turtle is traveling by boat.

The first and third quadrants are positive numbers, the second and fourth quadrants are negative numbers, and the center of the graph is zero, where x=0. How many distinct negative numbers greater than -2 have an absolute value of 10?\n\n### Response::: B: Because the center is zero. Any integer can be represented on the number line, so no other negative numbers besides -2 could be smaller than -2 and still have an absolute value of ten.\n### This means we can solve for any of those 4 quadrant by multiplying a number that represents a certain direction on the y co-ordinate. In the x co-coordinate. To be very specific on the number line. We can multiply our y co-ordinate to -4 when it goes down because we want 10 absolute value and 4 is the size and we can multiply 2 to the other x co-ordinate when it goes down because it goes down by the number we want and we get absolute value of 1 and we can multiply 3 to the other x co co-ordinate so it goes up because it goes up in the other direction. That is the positive side and we can get a minus of our x co-ordinate. That leaves us with absolute value of negative 1. Then we have only a multiplier of 1 and we have already completed the problem.", "answer": "C: winning or losing"}

For those who already pay a fee above $150 per week to have rubbish collected from their home, the government will not provide a discount. What is the value of 100/53?\n\n### Response  : 2.0\n\n### Solution:\n\nSo the number of households, that would get the benefit of the government for their disposing the solid waste, would be less than 53. Which is written in the given statement that, if the household generates less than 53kgs of waste, then they would avail the benefit of discounted collection. \n\nBut, if households generate less than 53 kg of waste per week, then its also possible that they would be above 53 kg.

The rancher wishes to sell half her sheep and her goats.  How many sheep and how many goats does she have to sell to get $1650?\n\nResponse 1: The answer depends on which is being sold.  The answer can be no more that the sheep sold or the goats sold.\n\n__If I sell sheep__, I would have to get the value of 70/130=$3.23*60=$196.60 and that would be the value of 71 sheep.

Days 3-5 feature low winds of 10 knots.\n\nAfter the first day of the hike, the guide advises the climber that the second day is expected to be rough. The winds should be low (10 knots), but the temperature will drop into the 10-20 range and climb back up into the 30s.\n\nEach day of a five-day trek, the guide informs climbers, requires the equivalent of a rest day spent down at lower elevations.  Therefore, after two days of travel, with a planned campsite somewhere near the summit, the climber needs to choose one of the following two options: 1) rest in the campsite provided at the base of the mountain, or 2) return to the nearest trailhead to spend the night.\n\nWhich is the correct description of the forecast information given above?\nRationalesThe temperatures are expected to rise on day three from low temperatures on day two into temperatures that are close to those experienced on day five.\n\nDays two and three are supposed to be quite windy, and it is also quite unlikely that conditions will be as calm as expected at both campgrounds on those days.\n\nDuring day two and day five, the conditions can be as calm as they are expected to be on day four.\n\nSince the guide estimates that each day is the equivalent of a restful day, and the guide expects that each of days two, three, and five will be rather windy, it is logical to assume that either campground could be windy and uncomfortable", "answer": "C: hedgerow"}

When you plug -1 back into it, it cancels out the -3, so that makes the two equal equations equal to zero.\nFor the first one, you have -4x+2y=-16 and  x -2y = 10. When you plug -4/2= <<4:-1=3>>-3 into -16, it equals 16-16=0 and 10-2y=10 and when you put 2/3=-1/3 =-1/3 into y, it equals one. So they both equal zero.\n\n### Response1:What is the sum of the first 4 even numbers?\n\n### Response2:The first three terms of the geometric progression (AP) are 4, 8, 16, Find the tenth term.\n\n### Solution1:\n4,8,15,25\n\n### Solution2:\nIf we look at the geometric sequence, it\u2019s 4,8,16, which equals 4X3=16 and then the next one is, 8*3=24, and then 16*3=48 and then 24*3=72 and then 48*3=144 and then 72*3=216 and then 144*3=432 and then 216*3=648 and then 432*3=1296 and then 648*3=2044 and then 1296*3=3892 and then 2044*3=6168 and 4128*3=12376\nYou subtract the first term from the 3rd, and then you subtract the first term from 4th.

Here, 'Bonjour', the opening words of many French-language TV programs, is the title of the program. Other examples from the text include 'The End'. Except for proper nouns, sentence terms, or titles, there are no capital words. \n\nThe article, 'The' is capitalized in titles. For example, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, The Hobbit, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, The Da Vinci Code, The Great Gatsby, The God of Small Things, The Color Purple, and The Great Gatsby to name a few are all books with stories, characters and names that are all \"The\" titles. \n\n### Input:(The)Bonjour!\n### Demon: \nIt's best to put the apostrophe before 'The', but I don't. (Grammatical rules are not my forte.)\nTherefore, the question mark and semicolon belong before 'The'. Otherwise, if you reverse the order of 'The' and 'Bonjour!' the question mark would go after 'bonjour' and the semicolon would go after the first '!'.\nHowever, some editors write like this. \n\n## How It Works\n\n![](../images/logo.png)\n\n![](../media/icon.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n### Get in Touch\n\n####  Instructors\n\n| Name   | Email |\n| ------ | ----- |\n| Anony  | Anony@gmail.com   |\n\n##### Contact Details:\n\n| Name            | Email                                   | Mobile No.             |\n| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------- |\n| Dr. Ketan        | ketankumarpatel634@gmail.com          |   9413424571           |\n| Dr. Rushikesh    | rushikeshpatel101@gmail.com            |      9461360721        |\n| Mr", "answer": "E: hands"}

It is important to learn how to do this and get familiar with it.\n\nInput: What do you do when someone does not want to learn something new?\n\nAnswer: I do not ask them if they want to learn. It is not something that can be forced on someone and when they don\u2019t want something it is not going to create success. I may ask them if they are okay with learning and if they are having difficulty. Sometimes people have trouble just accepting that they do not know certain things. That learning can be exciting and not painful or free. They can also change my perception of the learning process if I change it on them. They could get distracted or get dejected and just say they are not learning. If I change my perspective on them, not change them on me then I can help people focus and not lose interest by changing my attitude. If you don\u2019t like how the learning process is going then it can feel like it is painful as well. In the end it is the responsibility of the person to learn to change their perception and see the learning process to be what it can be instead of what they think it is.\n\n### Input Challenge\n\nChallenge\n\nThis is not a challenge.\n\nThis is not an exercise in trying to force information upon a person that will make them want to learn any less.

What's the best way to weigh both of them?\n\n### Response\nA\n\n### InputA train departs a station traveling at 50 mph towards the train yard. The length of this train is 520  ft. with 100 trains in a string of trains in order to park all of them correctly in the train yard. The train yard needs to be 1 mile long  to hold all of the trains and the trains should be parked every 110 ft. apart.  When will the train be able to get onto the train yard?\n\n### Demos : the train will take it's distance = 520/50 = <<520/55=10>>10 miles. The entire train is 10 miles. So in each 520 ft it travelled 520/10 = <<525>>525 ft. And so in 520ft it covered 520/2= <<520/2)=260>>260 ft.\n\n### Rationales\nThis is a little odd, but the train is just traveling the distance between stations, and getting closer to the train yard, each time it makes a stop.\n\nSo it will arrive once it goes the long distance back and forth.\n\nSo since 130/55=<<130/50=2>>2 trips it will take, it will arrive at the train yard = 520*(50+2)=<<520*(55+2)=110>>110\n\nSo just the one station it will take 110/50 =<<110/55=4>>4 trips.\n\nOr 260/50=<<26", "answer": "D: back and"}

{"text": "### Instructor:\nThe correct response is C.\n\n### Discussion:\nWhat does ignorance mean in the context? Is knowledge necessary? What role does curiosity play? If they are ignorant what does that mean? \n\n### Rationale:\nIgnorance is the state of being uneducated, unaware, or unknowledgeable.\nKnowledge is defined as facts, information, and skills acquired through experiences and education.\n\nIgnorance is not an excuse because ignorance does not mean naive or stupid. It means the inability to answer a question, explain something, or resolve a problem.\nPeople can make a conscious decision not to know something. They could choose that they do not need to know, so they don\u2019t act on their desire to know.\n\nCuriosity is key to the progress of the human species, but ignorance is not bliss. As a society we are faced with ever more complex, interconnected problems to solve. We live in communities and rely on public-serving institutions like schools and healthcare. Ignorance creates a barrier for us to reach solutions for these challenges.\n\n### Assumption:\nWhile I can understand that people do feel bliss, ignorance does not mean happiness, and I will take some time to discuss the difference between ignorance and bliss.\nIgnorance is knowledge of a problem with a choice to let the problem go and live in bliss. Bliss is an emotional state that is produced within the human body. \n\n### Output:\nIgnorance: Ignorance would be someone who did not know the answer to the question and was not even educated with the knowledge to find the answer. They do not know how to fix the problem and therefore the problem exists and could continue to exist.\n\nBliss: Bliss would be the state of not knowing that their is a problem and having no reason to know that there is a problem. Their body chemistry is producing happiness, which is a great state to be in.\n\nWhile ignorance is a problem, bliss is not and does not mean it is not a problem. \n\n\n\n\n<!-- # Rationale: \n\nThere were 17 questions on the exam.

The third tailor shows a collar that will push up six and one-quarter inches.  The first man says that he likes the second (or the third) suit the best.  Which collar is taller?\n\nRationales:\nFirst, the man wanted the top collar to have six inches then the man went to the next collar with six and one half inches so the height went up\nNext, the man went to the third tailor and asked if the suit had a higher collar and this one had six and one quarter inches.  Since the previous collar in the previous tailor shop was six and one half inches we can deduce that the top collar from the previous tailor shop went up six and one half inches.  Since the second tailor had the biggest collar of all three tailors and the man said he liked it the best we know that he saw the top collar from this one the best so we can deduce that this collar went up six and one quarter inches to make the highest collar of all three.

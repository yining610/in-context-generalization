I just want to be able to spend time alone with my daughter to help her understand what has happened and see how to deal with it.

Choices:  A: closet B: at hotel C: sidewalk D: bus stop E: trunk<n><n>### Response:		<n>Which answer choice best completes the request?<n><n>A. Choice A, Closet<n><n>Answer choice B (hotel) is wrong. Hotels typically have luggage pickup, and therefore they dont always have a closet either. Answer choice C is too vague. It doesnt give much of a description of where he is so you cannot accurately answer it. The other options may or may not have luggage lockers on site. However, I would be inclined to choose choice A with the closet because the person is driving themselves. Therefore, theyre probably planning on carrying the luggage onto the airplane, and it would be easier to put in a closet then carrying it around with you.<n><n>### Input:"The 1995 total for all federal, state, and local taxation was $2.3 trillion, and the 1995 national consumer price index, measured in 2009 dollars, was 174.3 (Bureau of Economic Analysis, n.d.).

Choices:  A: place of work B: office C: friend's house D: workplace E: deep thought<n><n>### Response:		In 425 (425 people go to their place of work to visit the offices of their co-workers), the human-centric place that people visit to engage in person-to-person interactions is a place of work. The other choices are either places where people go to do work that is not directly related to people-to-person interactions (office), a house for friends (friend's house), or another place where people work (workplace).  <n><n>### Input<n>In a country with more than twenty states, the 26th state has about a quarter as many residents as the 12th largest state. The 23rd state has 6% of the residents of the smallest state. If the smallest state has a population that is one twentieth that of the largest state, what percentage of the total population of the country are people whose home state is smaller than the 26th largest state?<n><n>### Response<n>Since this question is not stated using variables, we can use this technique to fill the placeholders: 23<26 which indicates that 26 is the bigger number. We know that 23<23 because the smaller number is the place of the larger number. 6%x26 is.06*26, so we get.144. That puts the number of people who stay in their home state at 16.6%.<n><n>In addition, we know that if x<y, then x<x/y. This holds because if x<y, which means x<y, because if one is smaller than the other, then the bigger one must be bigger than the other. This means that: 23<x=23<26/23 = 5/8 <n><n>So, by plugging 23/26 back into (23<x)=(7/8>x)<n>.144= (7/8)>23/26. Since we know that 144/26=5,.144/.26=5/144 so.144/.193 is.596/193. This gives.29/3 to the right side of the equation.

Clarisse’s mother can explain how to do arithmetic problems involving fractions to Clarisse.<n><n>Fractions represent two numbers and contain four basic parts: the _numerator_ (n), the _denominator_ or _bottom number_ (d), the _fraction_ (i.e., n/d), and the _proper fraction_ (i.e. n/d>0). A denominator with a 1 means that one whole is being split up, for example 1/2 or 1/2=110.<n><n>A _reciprocal_ of a fraction is an operation that reverses the division process. That is, the reciprocal shows you how many times one part of a fraction can be divided into any other part. For example, 1/5 of 10 will be 2. Like a division problem, this problem shows us how many times a whole can split into two parts, for example, 1/2=5, and 1/2=2.<n><n>In the problem below, write the fraction in its simplest form by filling in zeros in the numerator if necessary, and fill in the denominator with the proper number.<n><n>Given numerator, denominator, and/or fraction:<n><n>1. In the first step, convert the fraction into a decimal. For example, 9/13 is converted to 0.6923.<n><n>2. Then compare these two decimal numbers. If the number under the decimal is higher, write that number in the numerator.<n><n>3. Then compare the two numbers now in the numerator. If the other number is a bigger number, fill in zeros in the numerators until they are the same.<n><n>4. If both the numbers in the denominator are the same, the fraction is in its simplest form.<n><n>### Your Task:

They could be taken away from the trees in the rain forest and to this place but we don't know which one of 6 options it is.<n><n>2. The second text narrows down the options because it suggests that there is a place where people wear white colored lab coats to treat of monkeys. We can eliminate choices A, B D, E.<n><n>3. However, there is choice C that says that monkeys are brought away from ___ to a __ which means that monkeys are taken away from one place and brought to another place and we can eliminate that choice too.<n><n>4. The third text gives us a way to narrow down the options because we we're told that the research laboratories focus on ___ that is medical and veterinary research. There are no other research laboratories and their purpose so we can eliminate choice B as well.<n><n>5. Finally, the option choice E can be eliminated because it is a location instead of an activity. This choice isn't correct<n><n>6. Now, we are only left with choices A or C.

How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?<n>Answer: 6<n><n>### Input:Where do people traditionally get information about the world? Choices:  A: book B: meeting C: television D: guide E: newspaper<n><n>### Response:		If you did not know which answer to choose, then select the most appropriate answer. Otherwise, select an answer and provide the reasons.<n><n>You have several options to choose from when looking for information about the world.  A: The first choice is a book. A book can provide a detailed and factual description of a topic. Books can also provide a different point of view than what is typically presented in the news. B: The second choice would be a meeting. Meetings are a chance to ask questions and discuss different perspectives on a topic. This is a good way to broaden your knowledge. C: The third choice is television. Television is a quick and reliable method of getting information about the world. However, it may cause you to only focus on one point of view. D: The fourth choice is a guidebook. Guidebooks give you the facts and figures of a place or time in history. They are useful for giving context to a place or topic. E: The last choice is a newspaper. Newspapers provide the facts of a topic, and they typically have their own point of view on the topic.<n><n>### Answer:  E<n><n>### Input<n>  Whenever she is going for a walk, Carla always keeps a tote bag in her backpack. She likes to be prepared wherever she goes. Do you agree with Carla’s decision to have a bag in her backpack?<n><n>### Response<n>I disagree with Carla's decision to always carry a bag in her back pack. It is not realistic to be carrying a tote bag when you walk somewhere. Sometimes it can be difficult to open your backpack and find the tote bag inside.  I think that it would be more practical to keep things handy so that they can be easily stored away when walking.<n><n>### Input : Which two teams had the exact same record last year?<n><n>A: Texas and Texas State<n><n>B: Texas A&M and Texas State<n><n>C: A&M-Corpus Christi and UTSA<n><n>D: Lamar and UTSA<n>E: Lamar and Texas A&M<n><n>### Response : <n><n>The two teams with the same record last year were Lamar and UT San Antonio.

Which student’s class has the fewest students?<n><n>### Response. This is the correct answer. A class that has one student needs to be added to the problem.<n>There must be a class that has at least two students that is excluded from the set. If there are no excluded classes, or fewer than one, then there will be one class that has fewer than one student.<n>Let P(a,b,c,d) = the probability of 4 classes having n students, such that 45 students are partitioned to four classes.<n>Let S be the class that has one student.<n>Since the classes are exclusive to one another, P(A,B,C,D) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) + P(D) - P(S).<n>P(S) = p = 1/n= 1/45. P(A) = P(B) = P(C) = P(D) = 1-p = 3/4.<n>Therefore, P(S) = 36/45.<n>The answer to the problem states that the class that has 1 student has three excluded students, so P(S) = ~36/45 ~0.3 ≈ 0.24.<n>The class containing the least amount of students, S, has a probability of 0.24 (less than 1/4)<n><n>### Input<n><n>A class with k students can have k−1 classes with the rest of the students.<n><n>### Response<n><n>There are 45 students that can be divided into four classes.<n>This means that there are at least 44 classes, without considering a class with a student.<n>The class that has the least number of students, s, is:<n><n>### Input The sum of three consecutive numbers is 32. What are the numbers?<n><n>The sum of 2 consecutive numbers is 5, so x = 5. The difference of the middle value to the other is 5, so middle value = 7.

The students can complete their homework after that deadline, and no penalties or disadvantages will be deductions, as long as they complete it before the deadline. However, this does not apply if the students fail any assignments or exams before the deadline has been completed, as this will cause a deduction in their overall score in the course.<n>># A:<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>

E: let blood**<n><n>#### Response:<n><n>Leeches are famous for their unique blood-feeding abilities and were used in the ancient world by medical practitioners to treat disease.  This practice is believed to have originated with the Ancient Greeks and Egyptians.  During surgery, leeches are placed on the affected area and a small tube inserted into the patient’s skin to make it easier for them to absorb blood.  By sucking blood from the patient, they prevent bleeding, and thereby decrease infection risk. Leeches were used as medical treatment as recently as the early 1900s, but they were largely phased out due to the introduction of modern medical technology.  Leeches were commonly used as anti-blood clotting medicine to treat stroke, heart attack, and similar conditions, and the treatment was sometimes administered in conjunction with cardiovascular surgery to increase the amount of blood leaving the heart after surgery.<n><n>#### Demonstration:  The leech’s mouth has a specially adapted part of the jaw called a ______________________.<n><n>#### Instructions:Answer the following multiple choose questions.

(The jar was probably not _glass_, but _plastic_.)<n><n>### Input : 2, 2, 2<n><n>### Response : 6<n><n>## Solution<n><n>There are a total of 3 answers where only three are correct.<n><n>The first answer is 1+2+4 = 7 not 9.  It is one more because of how the subtraction is done.<n><n>Second Answer is 5+5+5=15 because the + is a simple addition and not the subtraction the first two answers were.<n><n>The last answer is wrong because it is 20 blocks. The subtraction on the second part does not equal 20. It equals 17. 17+5=22. The last one isn't 3. It is 8. 8x2= 16. 16+17+17=50. 50+5=55.<n><n>**Answer C** I chose answer C because 9*15=135. 9 is 3*3. 135+13=148. 48+13=61. So all the numbers are the same and just a difference of 3.<n>

Choices:  A: under rocks B: manhattan C: toenails D: grocery store E: fallen tree<n><n>### Response:		<n>I think there are many choices where it can’t be harmed by sunshine and these are:<n><n>### Grocery store:<n>The grocery store is a dark place; it is also a place where there is not much sunlight. Therefore, a grocery store is one of places where a fungus can grow. I also thought that because it doesn’t have much sunshine, it can also not be disturbed by it.<n><n>### Fallen tree:<n>In my opinion, a fallen tree can become a home for fungus and not even be harmed by sunlight. It is because there is much sunlight at the top of a tree, but it’s much less at its base. The fungus would grow at the base of the tree, so that it doesn’t get exposed to sunrays. In addition, a tree’s roots are always in the dark, and the ground which contains mushrooms is moist, so it is perfect for fungus to grow.<n>

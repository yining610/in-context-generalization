This means that the number of goals scored in two players will be at most 4% of the total goals in the league.\n\nAs we can see that the number of goals in 2 players represents 4% of the whole number of goals scored in league last season, which is 300. Since the number 300 is a whole we can represent it with fraction which is 10/100.\n\nAccording to the question the total number of goals that both players made is 30.\n\n30 = (10/10^4) (20%)\n\n30 =(1/20) (10/1/10^4).\n\n1/20 = 10/1/4 = 6/16.\n\n10/16 =. 625/3.06.\n\n0.517.\n\nHence 10/16 of goal scored by only 2 players.", "answer": "B: grocery cart"}

{"text": "A.\n### Solution: In the question, it stated \"After someone fills it with clothes\". The answer is C since shopping malls and supermarket sells clothes, thus the question is asking about the option which includes clothes. A shopping cart can never fill up since its an empty container which can be empty again, so this question does not fit this problem. A shopping cart is a container which can hold goods, thus it cannot be filled. A cashier is not someone who fills up a bag or container with clothes but only works in the cashier to collect payments, thus the cashier is wrong. A bookstore sells books and not clothes. The bookstore sells books, thus selling of clothes is not included. The correct answer is A, since there is no other option that fits.  In the question, after someone fills it with their clothes, I need a bag so a supermarket or shopping mall will do, thus shopping mall is the correct answer to the question.\n\n## Solution:\n>In the question, it stated \u201cAfter someone fills it with their own clothes.\u201d The answer is C. because shopping malls and the supermarket sells clothes thus the question is asking for the option which includes people wearing clothes. A shopping basket can never fill it with clothes since it is a container that can be emptied. A customer needs the cashier to get an item. And a shopping bag. A book store does not sell clothes and can\u2019t do. The right answer is C.", "answer": "C: shopping mall"}

Often, the first letter of a word becomes the first letter in the acronym. For example, an acronym that uses the first letter or letters of a word or phrase to form an abbreviation is, \"The full name for a popular social networking platform, 'Facebook'. In an acronym, the first letter or letters from a series of words are rearranged into an abbreviation of a new word. Thus, in the example above, the first letters of Facebook are rearranged to spell \"face.\" This new word is the acronym or an abbreviation for Facebook.\n\n### In the question above, Acronym means:An acronym is a word formed from the initial letters of words in a phrase. In mathematics, the most common acronyms (or abbreviations) used is, \"i\" is known as the \"imaginary number\", and \"i\" has the property that the \"i\" times itself is negative: 2 * i = -1.\n\n### Example of an acronym: i.e. - from Latin,  'id est', that is, 'i', 'I", "answer": "E: england"}

{"text": "A\n---\n\n### Answer: E\n\n---\n\n## Solution\n\n### Input\n\nA merchant bought 15 keyboard and 25 printer for a total of $ 2050.  If keyboard costs $ 20 then what is the value of printer?\n\nTo solve this question,\nwe must first understand what we mean by the term per. This is defined as a unit,\na group of things that can be counted. \n\nFor example, a classroom can be full of 20 books and 30 chairs, or 30 books and 10 chairs.\nWhen counting the books, you use the term per to note that two children are sharing the same 10th book: 2 \u00d7 10 books = 20. But when counting chairs, you use the same term to compare the value of the chairs: 10 times 2, or 3 \u00d7 10 equals 50. \n\nAs an addition, 20 books is referred to as an instance in a group of books. An instance of 20 books is similar to the concept of one cow, 10 cockroach or 25 birds. In other words, per is only useful when counting similar objects.\n\n### In this question, the term printer is counted for each instance of printer.\n\n### Thus, printer = $ 70 to answer this question.", "answer": "C: open boxes"}

Each cookie costs $1.41. If they consume two less cookies than the package has, how much did the group pay for the package of cookies? Enter your answer as a dollar figure only, no dollar sign or comma should be entered. (20 points)\n\n### Challenge\nSolution 1: Let the price of the package x = 100. The two members consume x-2 cookies. Each member consumes one more cookie so that the remaining cookies are shared amongst the two members. That is, each member eats 50% of the cookies or x/2 = $1.20, and the remaining cookies cost $1.80. The group spent $1.20+$1.80 = $3.00. Enter this as 890.\n\nSolution 2: If they had consumed 2x cookies then each member would get 100/(2x)=100/2 = 50 cookies, so each consumes 50 cookies at $1.41/cookie, i.e. each pays $141. Hence the amount paid is 141x2 = 282. Enter this as 2820.\n\n# Test 1\n## Description\nComplete the test below by filling in the correct function.

{"text": "Choice A\n\n### Instructions:How many gallons of gas does John drive at 90 miles per hour with his car that can fill up with 11 gallons, if it uses 8 gallons per 180 miles and his car can use 30 gallons of gas in 525 miles?\n\n### A sample answer: John's car can use 38 gallons of gas in total, and he drove at 90 miles an hour for 180 miles, or 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes per gallon. So he filled his gas tank up 3 times, hence uses about 11 gallons. He used 8 gallons or 90/180 x 30 = 8 gallons per each 180 miles. Since his tank can hold 11 gallons and he needs to fill it up 3 times, he used 34 gallons of gas in that 60 minutes. The answer is 38 gallons since 34 + 11 = 38 gallons.\n\n### How about you?!", "answer": "A: mail orders"}

How much did she earn in five weeks?\n\n### Answer:\n37500 * 5 / 100 = 382\n\n### Instructors explanation\n\n**Hint**: The correct answer is 382 because 2.0% is equivalent to 1 100 of a percent.

{"text": "Choice: E\n\n### Input\n### Instruction\nMaria lives in an apartment and has an empty plot of land. She is planning to make a park on the plot of land.  Each park bench costs $100, each tree costs $150, each bush costs $50, each flower costs $20, there are 20 benches and 50 trees.   Explain what the plot will cost if Maria is going to build the park by herself?\n\n### Response\nThe cost will be $?????\n\n### Instructions\nPlease list any other steps you took to solve this problem.\n\n### My response\nI used the logic that the cost to build the park is the sum of x+y, where x is the cost for a park bench and y is the cost of all the trees.  I then put $1,000 $100 for a park bench.  Since this does not equal $1,100 to $1150, and it does not equal $1500 to $1550, it must be that the other cost item is less than $1500.  The choice was D but not A or C.\n\n### Other steps\n\n### Instuctions\nWrite a response that appropriately solves the question and includes your entire method of calculation. Show all of your work and make sure it's clear.\n\n### Response to the response\nIt seems like you have some logic behind your thinking.

The desktops cost a total of $570. The laptops cost $100 less than the desktops.  The company spent a total of $540 for the two types of computers.  If one of every four desktops cost $12.50, how many laptops did the company purchase in total?\n\nInput:A store makes a 50% profit on every item they sell.  They sell 3 items at a total cost of $36.  How much profit did the store make on these items?\n\nAnswer and Result:\nA person might receive a pay cut, reduced hours, or a write up from a boss if they do not do well. Someone who does not do well at their job can receive criticism, a pay cut, reduced work hours or a write up, and, if they do especially badly, they might even receive demotion or termination.\nThere are 5 possible answers\n\nTwo possible answers: A and B\nOne possible answer: E\n\n\nDesktops cost $500. Laptops cost $125 less.  So the difference = $375. They spent $640.  The ratio = $620/640 = 10/11. 10 parts are desktops, 1 part is laptops.  So laptops = (11)(3/11) = 3/4 laptops.  Laptops = 3/4 * 3 = 2 laptops \n\nA company sells items at a total cost which is $1 less than the profit it receives for all sale.  Then the profit = $36.\n\n### InputQuestion:Every morning, Aunt Edna drives to her favorite donut shop.  She arrives 5 minutes after 7 and 17 minutes", "answer": "C: criticism"}

I pulled over and put on the new ones. So my question is, is there something that I can do with the old ones so that I could resell them? Choices: A) Donate them to your neighbor B) Put a hole in one tire (so it will be flat) and then sell it C) Fix the cracks that is, patch the cracks and then sell D) Fix the car with those tires, then sell that car to a scrap dealer E) Fix the cracks and then throw those away (to the landfill) F) Fix the cracks, then sell them to somebody who fixes such cracks in tires. (Don't throw them away)\n\n### Response:(85%) This is a really interesting question and I would like to take this chance to show you how I would answer it. First of all, I would answer your question in a way that is easy to understand and to implement. I would suggest two answers 1) to \nthrow them away, or 2) to put a hole in one tires so it would become a flat. My answer would depend on what you want to do with the new ones. If you want to sell them, then I would throw the old ones away, because this saves you the work of repairs and also this way I would not have to deal with the new (fixed) ones, which also makes their resale possible. The second choice, if you want to resell the old ones, makes sense if you want to repair them to show them to potential buyers.\n\n### Input :(5%) You should really make an effort to stay healthy (like getting enough sleep and eating foods with vitamins and minerals) but do you have to exercise in order to stay healthy?

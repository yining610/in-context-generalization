Choices:  A: trash can B: honey C: bouquet of flowers D: rose garden E: field of flowers<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### Solution <n><n>The bees congregate around the rose garden because the number represented by A is less than or equal to B, and the number represented by C is smaller than A. In addition, the number represented by D is smaller than B, while the number represented by E is less than or equal than D. Lastly, A, B, C, D, and E are all larger than E, which makes D or E the best answers. <n><n>#### Explanation:<n><n>A, B, C, and D, which represent the amounts of flowers are all less than E. The numbers that represent the flowers cannot be less than and equal to the number represented by E, so those options cannot be selected. In addition, A is less than or equals to B, and B is less than or equals A, which is not one of the options. Therefore, D and E are the only options that can be selected.<n>

How much money does he have in his wallet?<n><n>### Response :<n>John owns 36 extra dollars in his wallet, and since he only has 2.05 and 79, he should be looking for a wallet.

The prompt contains a question that asks for your opinion of the main character.<n><n>### Prompt:<n>  In your opinion, does the main character in the story, “Battle of the Best” by Eric Kimmel have integrity when she cheats?  What are the consequences of cheating in the story and how do they connect with your experience?<n><n>### Response<n>Cheating is wrong and dishonest and should not be done because the person who does it will be seen as a liar. Everyone has things they want out of life. Some people work really hard for what they want, for others they just cheat. Integrity is what the story, “Batlle of the Best” is about.<n><n>Integrity is a state in which the person acts in a consistent way, they do not change what they say or act like they’re different people in order to get what they want. They act the same way towards friends and family as well as people who they have just met. The story tells us that in the beginning there was a little girl named Sarah, who wanted to be the best knitter. In order to get the top spot on the list for the best knitter, the woman who is next to her on the list tells her about this magician who will turn her worst piece of work into a masterpiece with his magic wand. This woman who is next to Sarah tells her this because she would also like to be the best knitters and wants to be sure she gets the spot first. When Sarah uses this magicians technique and creates the best knitting, the man at the head of the list then decides that she should be the best knitter because it was the best work he had ever seen.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: lot of grief B: depression C: no spouse D: lose money E: children suffer<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer according to my own research was (A). For the spouses, they experience a lot of grief, some depression, or have money troubles because they usually have children that they must support. The children also suffer because they might not be in a close relationship with a parent anymore. These would then also cause a spouse to suffer as well.<n><n>### Input : What is a positive result to someone when two spouses are having sex?<n><n>### Response :<n>The research that I have done on my topic leads me to believe that the response would be that there are positive results to when two spouses have sex. This is because there are many positive emotions to be felt, including love, intimacy, and affection. There are also physical benefits to sex that two spouses will both receive, as well as emotional benefits.<n>

Choices:  A: backpack B: closet C: drawer D: dinner E: cupboard<n><n>### Response:		Answer A for an 80% response rate, or at least 400 responses.<n><n>### Feedback:<n><n>In this task the multiple choice question can be answered using the information that is given at the<n>instruction. Below are questions and their answers.<n><n>  1. Five less than three times is 10 less than 3 times the result. The result is thus 10 less than the number<n>thirty. Using that fact, it is found that the number of Dobermann puppies are 20. The number of Schnauzer<n>puppies are 55.<n>  2. After subtracting the number of toothbrushes given away in February from the ones given away in November, the difference is 39. Dividing the difference 39 by 2 we get  15.5. 15.5 is half the difference between the number the number of tooth brushes given away in January and February. The number the number of to theoth brushes the doctor gave away in January was 53. Now the answer can be used to solve for the number of toothpaste the doctor had in March.<n>  3.  There are  216   seashells, 192 on Monday and 68 on Tuesday.<n>  4. The number of fish remains 18, since there was  9  on Monday when it capsized, and  9  extra on Tuesday. <n>  5. One way to get to the answer of 36 is by using the fact that the shadows are 6 hours from noon. If the number of<n>feet in the shadows after 6 years (or 1 million, or 100 million, depending on what number of hours 6 hours is)<n>will be 360 feet, then the number of feet in the total number of shadows must  be 360 over 360, or 6 feet. The<n>shortest shadow at noon is 6 feet long. Therefore, the longer shadow will be 6*(6*5)= 360 feet.<n>  So, if they grow 360 feet longer in  1 year, it can be inferred that they grow 6 feet each  1 hour, and thus<n>  3  feet (or

Choices:  A: town B: at hotel C: mall D: business sector E: yellow pages<n><n>### Response:		Answer in complete sentences.<n><n>> I chose to answer the question above as A. Town. What is your answer?<n><n>When doing a survey like this, a person would not likely go to somewhere like a hotel because there are no places in the hotel to eat your own food. The person would look around to see if the restaurant is next to a mall or is on Yellow Pages to get a better idea and more direction if they are new to an area. However, there is no need to look next to a mall because the person is most likely eating at a hotel, so we would have a choice of "a" the town. If we think the person is using this to look at places to eat, they would first look on Yellow Pages since it's a list of the places in town that sells particular food, and the person would more than likely find a local restaurant or food chain.<n><br><n>If they looked in a "town" area, the restaurant is most likely there. In the small area if you walk around town or the city, there will be a restaurant in every block.  <br><n>They could be on the main street or on a side street. The main street gives you more of an impression of what the town is trying to offer, and the "side-street" gives you the feeling that you need to be there for a long period of time until it passes by. The local shops are always on a main street, and not all of them are there. <n><n><n><br><n><n>### Input 2:Choose the number closest to twice as many as the product of its digits.The product of its digits is:<n><n>### Response 2:Answer in complete sentences<n><n>> I chose answer #2.

Choices:  A: television B: bus C: email D: web page E: la ville<n><n>### Response:		If you see a signage advertising a new product in a television channel then you will automatically come to view this product. But this is only a part of the picture because television is a very wide media. <n><n>If you see a poster of a television channel on the bus then you may be able to know about a show. But  even if you use it to have fun you will get  a chance to see an advertise in the programme of the channel itself. <n><n>It can also be done in the form of email. But the point to be noted here is that the only way in which this is practically possible is to attach an advertisement to the email. <n><n>If there is an advertisement in a webpage you find when viewing news then it cannot be considered as the right one. This is because you are already reading for your use. You are not a spectator here. The webpage itself is the television channel. <n><n>We cannot find advertising in a telephone call, but we can get advertising  in the telephone itself. It's really the smartest one!  But in the 21st century, you might find such advertisement in la ville. All you do is walk! <n><n>### Input:"A" is to tall as "B" is to "C". "C" is to short as "X" is to tall as tall as "Y".

"A" is not equal to "D" so 5 is not equal to " D ". To tall means to be longer than someone or something compared to something else. So if  " A " Is to tall as 5 is to tall as tall  as " Y " But since " C " Is to short as 5 is to  " D " so  " A " to tall as 5. Means that "  A " is 30 cm.  " B "'s toll Is 40 (A=C+B)  " C " is 20 (A=30+20) " X

How much water does he drink a week?<n>Answer: 812<n><n>### Input:What is a sign that you might not be living soon? Choices:  A: growing older B: reproducing C: shuddering D: perspiration E: palpitations<n><n>### Response:		I shudder at the thought of growing older and reproducing, even though I know this is a sign that I already have. Therefore, shuddering is the sign of living a life soon, not perspiration.<n><n>### Input 1: What is the difference between "The cat ran over her face' and "Her face was run over by the cat" for the sentence "I tripped over the cat while I walked home yesterday"?<n><n>### Response1<n>#### 1.<n>The first sentence implies that the cat is alive and not dead or that the narrator tripped over the cat's corpse or even over the cat in person. That is, 'The cat ran over her' implies the cat was or is alive, thus is an active verb. 'Her face was run over' implies that her face was not, it isn't, and won't be alive. That is, 'Her face was run' implies that the cat ran OVER her face, implying cat's dead and its corpse. That is, <n>'The cat ran over her'' can't be the same as 'Her face was run...' <n><n>#### 2.<n>If one person trips over a cat and injures themselves, they say 'I tripped over the Cat'. If one person trips over something else and injures themselves, it goes back to 'I tripped over...', only now there is an adjective, so it'd go back to 'I triped over...(whatever they triped over)'.<n><n>#### 3.<n><n>The first sentence is more of a statement, and implied that the cat ran over her face; I tripped over the cat means I tripped over something which could have been the cat<n><n>#### 4.<n>While technically 'The cat ran over my face' is wrong, I think it can be disregarded because this sentence is only meant to show you that the cat ran over the face and the cat didn't run over mine face, it ran over another person's face. This sentence doesn't really have an intended structure.<n><n>#### 5.<n>This sentence can say either way, but I feel that using her face can be understood better in context.<n><n>### Response 2 (to the wrong response provided above)<n>If you're not sure of the rules, then you shouldn

Students often have other things to do after school such as sports practices, music lessons, or clubs that take up all of their time leaving them no time to complete their homework.

How much water does he drink a week?<n>Answer: 812<n><n>### Input:In what place could you find air that has been breathed by many people recently? Choices:  A: charming B: space shuttle C: house D: train station E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		 A<n><n>### Instructor Comments<n>You did great, nice job!<n><n>### Solution:<n>A: Charming is the correct response here.  The answer is _A_.  Choices have to be reasonable, so the house and space shuttle are not correct.  It's been breathed by many, many people so it can't be on the train station.  It's on earth so can't be space.<n><n>### Input 2:<n>A: charming B: ocean C: house D: office E: train station<n><n>### Response 2:<n>B: Oceans (specifically, the sea) are full of salt from the ocean water, while the air we breathe is fresh from the earth.  If you think of how much water there is compared to land, then it would be crazy to imagine an entire ocean worth of salt is breathed by people.<n><n>### Correct Answer:<n>The ocean is the correct answer because oceans have water that has been in them for much longer than land (even though some land water is many years old) so it would be unreasonable to think that an entire ocean of salt water would be able to be inhaled by humans.  Ocean air is not always unhealthy to breth through and it's not a polluted air.  Also, ocean air does not contain much oxygen which is the main part of breathable air (oxygen).  <n><n>### Input(3):<n>A: charming<n><n>### Response(3):<n>In the first part of this question, it said that the air has been breathed by "many people recently" but the way the last sentence is presented just makes it sound like the majority of air in the ocean recently breathed is only recent, but in the actual air and water the oceans do contain quite a lot of oxygen.<n><n>### Solution(3):<n>The answer to this would be "C".  If the previous statement was used in the text, then it would make sense to assume that it was referring to the sea that people breathe.   The ocean air that many people breathe is filled with fresh oxygen and other good elements.  The ocean is an enormous body of water that contains far more oxygen and good elements than any land.  The sea has been the place

The answer should have been **B: house**.<n><n>**B: house** is correct because the only options that relate to the kitchen are **A: bathroom** and **E: surface of earth**. **A: bathroom can be eliminated by crossing it out on the checklist**. The only choices with no relationship to the kitchen are **D: space shuttle** and **E: space shuttle*. Cross **D: space shurtle** off the checklist. Choices **B: house** means **the source of the smell is related to the kitchen**.<n><n>### Response<n>In this task, there are 5 choices that do not mention the smell coming from the kitchen, and these will be eliminated from the answer choices.<n>The correct answer is **A: bathroom.**<n><n>**A: bathroom** relates to the kitchen via its use of the word "kitchen." Since all other options are invalidated due to their use of "smell not in the kitchen," "not necessarily smelly," "nothing wrong with the smoke detector," and "kitchen not smelling anymore,” the answer is **A:bathroom**.<n><n>## Other<n>**The first step in writing the test is the instructions.** A comprehensive explanation about what is happening is necessary for you to write good instructions.<n><n>### Step 1:<n>Give a name (i.e. question name, topic name, etc)<n><n>### Step:2<n>Clearly state what the learner will do to solve the question.<n><n>Make the sentence simple and express ideas clearly on 2nd step.<n><n>### Third: <n>State the rules that the learner needs to follow to solve the question. <n><n>### Step Four:<n>Include the question<n><n>### Step Five:<n>Incldue the instruction or answer.

The instruction mentions “he began losing consciousness”, which implies that he lost consciousness for a short time and is aware of it again.<n>The answer choices are A and B. This could not be a “once” scenario as this was done under the assumption that “once” happened earlier in the text. Also, choice D makes no sense. It mentions jumping out of a plane but does not make a specific reference to doing so while scared. Lastly, the person in choice D mentions injury, which is not a scenario involving death. This is a true or false question, so if we exclude choice E the answer is B. “Once” was done earlier in the text, so in order for this to be a “once” sentence stem we must exclude choice C and B.<n><n>### Challenge Exercise

The museum takes up an entire city block, a series of old brick warehouses that used to hold cotton from the South and produce from the Midwest. When I was there, the exhibits were closed for renovations, but my friend gave me a special tour.  <n>  <n>One exhibit in particular caught my attention, a curator's work space off a big open hallway filled with old wooden crates. Inside the room were two stacks of wooden boxes. One stack was about ten inches tall, the other was much taller, probably three feet. A pile of old newspaper clippings was spread across the floor.  <n>  <n>I asked my friend what she was working on, but she just answered with a grin, 'Don't ask, it's a secret.'  A curator doesn't have to tell you what she's working on when she's at work.  <n>  <n>A few weeks later I got to thinking about curators.

One character in the novel is a boy named Jake. I thought that Jake sounded like the type of name for a boy that would hang out with a bunch of other boys doing things they shouldn't. The other book was Neil Gaiman's fantasy novel _Coraline_. I don't really think Coraline was an interesting character, but I thought J.J. was a name that sounded a little strange.  When I  heard J.J. I thought of the 'J' sound. I thought

I also changed to the `<img>` tag, since you were using an `<image>` tag, which the code will not accept (i.e. `<img class="character" src="images/character.png">`).<n> <n>

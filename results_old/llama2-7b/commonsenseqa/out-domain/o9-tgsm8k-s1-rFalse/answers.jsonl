First off, the response answers the question correctly, but also includes an explanation for _why_ it got its answer correct, something that is difficult for robots to explain due to the nature of their process model. An even more interesting result is in the third paragraph, where the question and response both include the word \"all of a sudden.\" It is apparent that we don't want the robot to simply guess on words like \"suddenly\" and \"appear,\" and would prefer not to have to model hundreds of thousands (perhaps millions) of unique sequences of words and symbols, with the aim of recognizing a \"sudden\" in a sentence when it occurs.

He didn't order us to make chair legs.  So, the chairs are complete. If the total of 8 chairs is less than 1060, my boss will deduct extra money from my salary. If the difference between the total of complete chairs and 1060 is more than one, we will get extra money. For example, if we made 9 chairs in total, the difference will be more than one.  Since they are making 8 chairs, the difference will be less than one.\n\n### The answer should read:If you make 8 chairs and my boss orders you to make 1060 chairs, how many chairs are in excess after you make 8 of them?\n\n### Additional instructions:How do you answer this question?\n\n### Instuctions: Write the correct sentence or phrase for each blank.\n\n### 1.

We also were given the total length of the word, \"spag\" and three other smaller words, 'in' and 'the restaurant'. Now, we can look through our data and find that the number of letters that are in the words, \"In the restaurant\" are 4 letters smaller than the other 3 letters that it is attached to. Also, we can notice that we have been given that the longest word in the sentence is \"in\", the next longest is \"spaghetti\" while the next 2 words with the length of 3 to attach to are \"the restaurant.\" Using this information we can conclude that the answer to our question is the number 2, because the word, \"in\" has twice as many letters as the word \"spaghetti\" which can also be connected to the word with two times as many letters as \"spaghetti\" to conclude that it has twice the number of letters as \"spaghett", "answer": "B: suburban home"}

In 2000 the average salary was 3504. What is the average salary today, based on a minimum of 5 years of teaching experience?\n\nResponse: To solve, we need to first multiply the original value for years by its year's average income, then subtracting the total value of the average income from the minimum value of 5 year average income. So, for the question to be solved we need to find 685, 3504 and the answer which is at least 3615. We can find 685 in 1950 by multiplying 1.\nThen we can find 3504 in 2000 by doing the same: multiply 1, the original value of years by its year' s average income. By doing so we get an answer of 6185 then, we add minimum average income 3615 to the answer we found earlier in 6185.\n\n\n### Input 3\n\nInput, Input: 5 people take a bus trip. The bus trip will cost $26 for the first person and $8 each for any additional passengers. How much will the group need to pay for the trip?\n\nResponse: \nTo solve the problem, you must calculate how much each person needs to pay for each person individually. We do this by finding the $26 for the 5th person and subtracting it from all other values. We can do this by saying, 26 is the $ of the fifth person - 74 is the 4th person (because it is 26(5) -74(4))\n\nNext, we make sure all of our answers are in dollars so we can multiply it. So we are left with the 3rd person who would equal 74(2) - 74(2).\n\nWe can then solve with division since $74 divided by $8 equals 9.9 with a remainder of 4. To further simplify this fraction, we can re-write it as 4, because we know that 9", "answer": "C: care for children"}

There are 16 spaces in the text box (in this case). The last 4 spaces are empty. That is because there are 16 possible answers, and the last 4 answers are already taken up by the example. Each answer is one character shorter than the one before it, and each line of solution is therefore longer than the one before it. This will help you organize your response.\n2. **In class we will discuss the different types of questions being asked (e.g.'multiple choice'), and the skills you will be required to demonstrate (e.g. writing concisely, reasoning, etc.).**\n3. Write your response as you would a story - use the structure of the input problem as follows:\n    * Write a number (using spaces to represent decimal places) in the left-most space.\n      - If the number is less than 10, you do not need to input a leading zero.\n      - For example, the number 9354 should be written \"9354\".\n    * Write each answer one space to the right of the number.\n      - For instance, the number 900016 would be answered by entering \"Answer: 1\" for \"Answer: 1000001 100016\".\n    * Include \"Answer: \" in front of each response.\n    - The answers will not be \"one\", they'll be the right numbers written in the space in front of \"Answer:\". The number of answers is not important when determining your score.\n4. Write as little as possible but as much as you need to answer the question. Focus your response on the problem you've been given and not anything extra. A good guideline is to write 10 characters for each question, but your actual response length will probably differ somewhat.\n5. You may not ask an instructor for help.  You will only be scored based on what you input - not what you ask a teacher or TA for help with.

{"text": "E\nThe above instruction provides an example of calculating a fractional unit. The first step would be to recognize the denominator is an even base number, 100.  \nSecond, you would divide 1 by the denominator, since the numerator (the part before the division sign) is the number of items you are trying to determine relative to the denominator (the part after the division sign). If you do not know how to divide 1 to determine remainder, you could use the division algorithm. A helpful hint is that 1 / 1 equals 1 (1 remainder).\n\nAfter determining 1 out of every 3 is covered by the water, you would need to find the percentage of what's covered to determine the answer. Since the fraction \"one third\" equals 1/3, you could use percentages to calculate what percentage of 100 is covered by the water.   \n\n### Input :The average age in a class is 15.

{"text": "E\n\n### Explanation: \nDuring the process an officer may have to present evidence to the arrest warrant. When presented, evidence must be supported with an arrest warrant. The officer must then call a witness to the jury. If the witness does not come for a jury, a case will not go to trial. The judge, after hearing the testimony of the witness, will either accept the testimony as true and convict the defendant. If the judge is not comfortable with the testimony, he will not accept it and release the defendant. A jury will decide if the defendant is guilty or not. For example, if the testimony of a witness shows that the defendant had committed a crime such that he possessed a gun or a knife, a jury can convict the suspect and he will be sentenced to prison \n\n### What should a player do when he is not sure if he is supposed to take the ball to the left or right?\n\n### Experiment:Try this yourself\n### Answer:A\n\n### Exploration:The rules of soccer are clear so as long as a player takes the ball in the right direction, he will be able to play and score.

{"text": "Ghost town (B)\n\nDetailed Solution:\n\nWe know that the correct response can be A, B, C, D, or E. First, we eliminate the choices that are not correct responses. We know that \n\nDisease isn't spread in C because it exists inside us. If it was inside us, it wouldn't be spreading, so we know C is not the correct answer.\n\nSimilarly, we also know that D and E are not correct because the human body is not a ghost town. There are people, so it cannot be a ghost town.\n\nNow, we are left with the 4 remaining choices: A, B, D, and E. We first focus on A and B because they are opposite choices, meaning that if choice A is correct, then choice B must be incorrect.\n\nFurther, we notice that in choice A, disease can be spread, but since disease is spread there, it must be in a ghost town. Therefore, disease can only be spread but must definitely not exist there.\n\nOn the other hand, choice B states that disease exists in the ghost town but can be spread. It must exist in a ghost town since disease cannot exist anywhere apart from a ghost town. However, it can also be spread, which suggests that the disease cannot be spread in B. We conclude that A must be the correct choice.\n\n### Input : There are 30 girls in my class. I have 7 pears. Each pear feeds 3 people.

She has $50 left after buying new shoes. She has three hours to spend on her allowance and wants to save a little. She can only purchase things at a value of $20 or less to save 25%. She doesn't like to spend too much. Each pair costs $6, one jacket costs $50 and four pairs of socks cost $7. How many items can she buy at her family's store?\n\nMary wants to save 25% of the allowance or $5. She has $10 to spend, so she must calculate 0.25 * $10, which equals $2.50. She wants to buy items that are $20 or less because the sales tax is equal to 7.5%. If each pair costs $6, then 0.25 x 6 equals $1.50 in tax, so to save 25%, she subtract $1.50. As for the jacket and the socks, Mary can purchase two pairs of socks and four jackets. Her final cost with 25% off is equal to $1.75 + $2.50 + $24 = $29.25. Mary has a total of 6.5 hours to spend on her weekly allowance, so she has about $0.45 an hour to spend. Mary wants to purchase 6.5 / 2 / 1.75 = 3", "answer": "B: look attractive"}

Would you want to make a deal with someone who doesn't know how to cook? Would you expect to pay more if you know the person and trust them to do a good job? How about if their food smells terrible? Would that affect how much they charge, even if the food would be better for you? Do you think they'd charge a lower price for dinner or higher? Now, given that you would expect the same personality to be willing to cook for you as would clean your home, would how much you pay depend on what percentage of your time you spend cleaning your home?\n\n#### Response: \nYes, there are benefits to outsourcing. However, outsourcing can be quite expensive if an individual outsources tasks that are not highly specialized, or that would be more efficient to do in house. Moreover, there are costs involved aside from paying a service provider. It is inefficient to outsource things that are simple for an individual to complete in house. This is because it is not cost effective in terms of time to complete the task (if it takes longer to complete the work than pay an outsourcing service than it is more cost effective to keep one of the company's employees busy rather than hiring an outsourcing company to save time).\n\nI do believe that a person who is willing to clean my house is willing to prepare my food for me if I am willing to pay them.

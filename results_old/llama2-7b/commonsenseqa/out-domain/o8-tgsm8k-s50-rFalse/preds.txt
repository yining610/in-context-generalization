How is each individual’s monthly salary determined?<n><n>#### Answer:Each person is paid per month for each of the 3 categories based on their percentages.  The 3 categories are based on their individual percentages of work done in each area.<n><n>#### Input<n>> Instruction/Demonstration:<n><n>After the team is finished with their part of the project, they bring their results to the Engineering Division for evaluation and payment.  Each of the tasks are worth a certain amount of points of money and are based on the percentage of work done.  For example, if I work 50% on the project and I’m in the engineering department, my salary will be 50% of the salary that is awarded to the other department.  In order to calculate the percentage of work in a specific area, the individual adds 1 if they work in that department and 0 if they don’t.  For example, an engineer named Sam works for this specific company.  He is a software engineer and he has never worked in the mechanical department.  In his division, he finds that there are 4 people in the engineering division and 1 person in the mechanical division.  After adding up the numbers, he found that there are 28% who work in his division and 7% who work in the mechanical division.<n><n>#### Response<n><n>#### Input/Response<n><n>#### Instructions:<n>> In order for your team to receive payment, they must have met their milestones.

If I wanted to make breakfast for 4, how many times would I have to divide my original recipe?<n>### Response: you should divide 2(x)<n><n>### Input -  Let’s use an analogy to explain the situation.  Let’s say you have a bucket (or a glass) of water and the goal is to divide it into 5 equal portions (3 for 3, or 2 for 2).  First we divide the water in half, or half-and-half.  Then, you take one half and add the same amount of sugar, which doubles the amount of water.  Now it takes four equal portions of water to divide in half.  So, divide it into four, and then the 4 equal portions are divided into 2.  How is this possible?<n>### Response - You have to divide by 2<n><n>### Input – I’m looking for an ice-flavored drink for my family.  As a bargain, I found an awesome 16-ounce bottle for only $5.  However, it has 14 ounces of liquid.  It would be a shame to waste some of that water in the bottle, but if I use the whole bottle, only 6 ounces of ice would be in my glass.  I’ll use another bottle with 8 ounces of ice and make it up to 8.  Now the third bottle only has an ounce left in it.  Even so, it still fills out my 6.5 oz drink.  I just need the last bottle to make it 7 oz to be perfect.  If I bought 2 bottles, can I buy one bottle for $4 and then a second bottle for only $2?<n>### Response –  You have to multiply 16 by 2 to be able to buy 2 bottles.<n><n>### Input- There are three ways to calculate the tip to leave someone.

Choices:  A: stress B: nervousness C: smile D: being bored E: making new friends<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>I am going to choose choice C because it says that "When someone is aloof with someone else, that person is usually not very social." I think that when a person is aloof, that person would most likely be bored.<n><n>### Input : <n>You own a company and need a new employee.  A job offer can be an attractive option, especially because your new company offers a great salary, a health insurance package, and stock options.  A big part of the decision of whether or not the new employee accepts your offer is how that person feels about the environment in which they are working.  It is possible to increase the salary of the job offer, but it will be difficult to increase a new employee's experience points! What should your company do to make its offer more attractive? Choose three of the options.  A:  Offer stock options  B:  Have fun projects C:  Work remotely D:  Talk to the company's existing employees  E:  Work out a flexible schedule for the new employee F:  Allow employees the opportunity to go to school  G:  Have good hours (flexible, with time to spend as a family)<n><n>### Response<n><n>I am going for choices C, D, F.

Choices:  A: lake B: aquariums C: swimming pool D: pond E: childrens pools<n><n>### Response:		<n>In this particular example, Hurley is 11 years old and Richard is 30 years old. They are going to be 40 years old in 40 years. Hurley is going to be 14 years old. To find the combined ages of Hurley and Richard, we will subtract 11 from 40. We can then solve this question by multiplying the 20 difference in ages with 14, which provides us an answer of 280. This does not add up because they are going to be 10 years older than the Hurley is today, since Hurley is going to turn 15 in 40 years, which means that 10 years later this year will be 30 years from now. Hence, the combined ages are correct because they are going to turn 30 years old at 40 years old.  Therefore, Hurley’s combined ages are 27 years old and Richard’s combined ages are going to turn 46 years old at 42 years old when Hurley’s going to turn 51 years old.<n><n>### Input：<n>Pablo’s mother agrees Pablo is going to read 150 books. Pablo will buy at least 150 books, and will collect his money. He plans to save for $15 worth of $150 candy and has $3 saved. How many books will Pablo have read?<n>To solve this question, we can start by first setting our equations equal to one another. We can state the following equation:<n>$$150 + \left(\frac{\$15 \times $150}{15}\right) = \$$<n>To solve this equation, we will perform subtraction and isolate the variable $b$. The values we will be using are $15$ for the value of $x$, $15$ for $n$, and $0.1$ for $p$. We will then subtract $7$ from both sides. We can then isolate the variable $p$. That provides us with $7 < p \le 24$. We can use the information available to us, and multiply $7$ with $100$ to provide us with an interval 120 to 240. We can use the lower number 120, and add or subtract an element. We then

Although this is the only choice that makes sense, the choices are not all correct.<n><n>### Answer : <n>If 1000 people were asked, how much do you think will respond that they have seen a UFO at least once?<n><n>### Answer<n>The 1 in 1000 choice indicates that 1% of people have seen a UFO. This is correct because 1000 is 1% of 10000. This is the best choice because it makes the most sense. While it makes more sense to use percentages to describe how many people, 1 in 17,000 is still a little far fetched, but it is more reasonable than 1 in 1300.<n><n>### ANSWER<n>It is a little hard to tell from the options, so we'll just make an assumption. If each cup can hold 5 times the amount of water as the average cup, then each cup can hold 10 times its own average. This is because the cup holds 15 times the amount of the average cup. However, since the average cup can hold 17 ounces, this is incorrect because the average cup can not hold 17 times its own average. So, the correct answer is A: The average person can lift 80 pounds.<n><n>### <n>The answer is none; there is no answer. At 80% of his age, someone is 28 years old.<n>

Because of this, john is very careful about the places he goes.  Where might he avoid going? Choices:  A: pet store B: parking lot C: woodland D: north america E: park<n><n>### Response:		<n>If john loves animals and he's careful about the places he decides to go, avoiding places like the zoo or pet store would make sense. Although North America seems to come up more than some of the other options, it's obviously a part of the world where he might not be as likely to have animals. He obviously wouldn't be very happy anywhere there was animal abuse, but A, B and D would cover what he would need. He wouldn't need to avoid woodlands, and he would probably have a pizza parlor or two around, but it would be odd if someone who loves animals would only eat at the zoo or a pet store. So, John avoids places like B and D for this reason.<n><n>Answer: A, because he might want too see animals at the zoo but at the same time not go through a pet store to avoid animal abuse. <n><n>Answer: It would make sense for John to avoid places like the zoo because there is animal cruelty happening to animals in the zoo. He would want to prevent the animal abuse. This reason is because he loves animals. A: Pet Store B: Parking Lot C: Woodland D: North America E: Park Answer: B and D

Choices:  A: read B: passenger C: land plane D: fly the plane E: buy tickets<n><n>### Response:		 [C] [Passenger]<n><n>### Input 2:  The owner of the car shop knows his customers' cars require oil. He fills up their cars once every 15,437 miles they drive. At the shop, oil costs $12. He charges $21 for an oil change.  How much oil does the shop have to purchase in one month to fill all the cars' oil tanks?<n><n>### Response 2: 44 gallons<n><n>### Output<n>```<n>The task that was asked was how many gallons of oil was needed.<n><n>So here are three ways to solve this:<n>* $12/gallon = 15,482 miles, so you'd need to buy 12/gallons (not 15,417 gallons but 15482 gallons.)<n>* The shop needs to buy 1, 9, 49 gallon cans<n>* If every person drives 16,000 miles, then multiply that by 15, so it's 240,000 miles. Divide 240, 000 miles by 16, 000, which gives you 15. So if each car is driven 16,024 miles, then the shop would need to purchase 12 more gallons.<n>```<n>And the most correct one was the last one because it's the most effective way of using the given information (the shop serves 16,0 000  miles per month.)<n><n>```<n>The task I was asked was what number are doubled. You could go by the name but just in case of spelling errors you might want to go by the number like this 1 16879 and if you double it you get 33758 and then you want to make it perfect square so you need to multiply it by itself. So if you multiply it by 81  then you will get 7 9 79  79 24 566<n>```<n><n>```<n>The first step to solving this one is to multiply the numbers to know how many digits are needed: 1.001 *.001 =.000999. So the number is

Choices:  A: efficiency B: getting work done C: marriage D: finishing up E: results<n><n>### Response:		<n>I think what they are looking for here is something like what I found in a reddit article. https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/185jj8/how_common_is_a_4p0m_1b_wedding_in_the_us/  <n>According to the article, 4.0+ million dollar wedding are about 1.0% of the total spend on the wedding. The weddings between 2.0 to 3.0 million are 2.1%. The article doesn't address efficiency however.<n><n>### Input:"How much would 35% be if it were reduced by 25%"<n><n>### Response<n>It looks like you want me to reduce a fraction. First, I like to check that I'm not working with an improper fraction. That is, the numerator is bigger than the denominator. <n>To do that, it's a good idea to convert the fraction into a mixed number. For example: "25% is 1/4" becomes "1 4/4".<n>Now I know that the answer is 2 or less than 5/4 (3/4) which is less than 4/2 which it the 1/2 used in the previous instruction. Therefore the answer to 35% reduced by 25% is around 19%.

Here, what is written by the statement is “Where can you find pamfilas.” So the correct answer is D, i.e. a drawer.<n><n>### In question 2 answer can be obtained by considering one option A as false and other options as correct. Here, the question is related to money. In the answer choices (A, B, C & E), only options (A & E) states about money, while options (B & C) states about the place where one can find pamfilas. For example, in ‘health department’ (C) people might get pamfilas related information and in ‘library’ (A) people might get information related to diseases, not pamfilas. As option (D) states that pamfilas are found in a drawer so other answers are false. So, option D ( drawer ) is correct as the correct answer.<n><n>### Now, consider a situation.

The question states “gathering pollen”, which is the insect’s activity of collecting pollen from a flower in order to feed his family or colony. The activity of gathering pollen can also be seen around a beehive, which we refer to the activity of the bees as “gathering around”.  Because this activity is not the only possible activity of the bees, and because a beehive only contains the bees, this question can be answered as B.<n><n>## Solution2:<n><n>### Question:  A farmer had 40 sheep, then she bought 12 more sheep and lost 4 of these sheep. How many sheep does the farmer have now?<n><n>### Expluation: The answer is E.<n><n>### Answer:  Because the farmer had 48 sheep, sold 12, and lost some sheep to animals, the farmer still has 36 sheep.

The lizard tries to stay hidden from humans. There is a 20% chance that the lizard will make noise when it is scared by a human. A hiker has a 90% chance of being scared by a lizard. If the lizards noise does not scare the hiker, then the lizard will surprise the hiker with a lizard. If a hiker makes a lot of noise when they are scared, then the lizard is less likely to surprise the hiker. If the hiker is carrying a backpack, then the chance that the hiker will make a lot of noise when scared is 90%, otherwise the chance is 80%. What are the odds that the lizard will surprise a hiker?<n><n>### Input<n><n>Input: This math challenge was inspired by the story The Lizard Problem at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zQwNqQ6qJQ. The rules are simple.  You can use a lizard to create as much chaos as possible by only one thing: leaving a trail of blood. The lizard can only leave a trail of blood if it eats humans, but it is only 10% likely to do it.  Lizards are always looking for an opportunity to escape their predators but must always keep in mind their predator is a human. A lizard can hear a human calling their name and become scared, but the best way to find a lizard is to look for a dark trail of blood. The best way to find a trail of blood is to stay in a group of 5 people. What is the probability that a human will successfully follow the trail of blood?<n><n>### Instructions<n><n>### Demos<n>1.

They're both pretty much the same size and weight though because the balls are made for children who don't have much on their arms. I recommend you go to a toy store and get one there since you'll save a lot of money that way.<n><n>### Input :The doctor wanted to use a pineapple on one of his patients, but the patient said that he had an allergy to pineapples.

The answer choices are:<n><n>* A: gently<n>* B: carry only<n>* C: farmer's markets<n>* D: restaurants<n>* E:  with a bushel basket<n><n>D was the answer that was chosen in the question.<n><n>Comment: You're not describing a task. A task is a set of instructions. Ask yourself: if you were the Tester, did you understand what you were asked to do? If you don't, then there's something missing from the task itself; if you do, then there's a mismatch between what you say you did and what the Tester is asking about.<n><n>Comment: So you're saying the answer is D: carry potatos home with a bushel basket?<n><n>Comment: No, I'm saying that if you didn't understand the question, then either the question is incorrect, or you've interpreted it incorrectly. Either way, you can't "write a response that answers it", because you either *won't* understand the question, or *can't* write a response that answers it. Try again, but *don't* write just a response. There's no one right answer here.<n><n>Comment: @IronMan I have edited to my answer. I guess I will have to try again.<n><n>Comment: Please include a specific task in your question; that way you will have a chance of getting an answer if you're having difficulty, instead of needing to describe what you did.<n><n>Comment: I'm not really sure what this Tester is asking. The instructions look a lot like they're part of a programming exercise. I haven't read all the code examples, but the answers look like they're written using the Python interpreter, not in code. Someone's written out all the code; if I read it right, you have to figure out which of the two variables in the last expression has value 243, given the two arithmetic operations performed on them. You figure out that the answer you get is incorrect by running the code in the Python interpreter and then printing out the value of num.<n><n>Comment: Yes, it is from Codewars https://www.codewars.com/kata/5f0771ee1f6

When you are turning the Rubik’s cube you have 12 sides and there is a piece on the right side of each side.  If you don’t rotate each side, then you won’t be able to determine which side needs to rotate.  Therefore, when you have turned all 12 sides, you should have 12 pieces that need to rotate in the opposite direction.<n><n>### Answer-4: The value of the square is $77/2$<n><n>### Instrectorer:<n>First, we must find two values of the $5\times5$ square (and the other squares).<n>

Choices:  A: orchestra B: baritone woodwind sound C: symphony D: play music E: high school band<n><n>### Response:		The only valid answer is B.<n><n>### Explanation:A is incorrect because orchestras also contain bassoons. Also, symphonies contain many bassoons. B is correct because playing a bassoon in an unpleasing way would only be possible in a musical group where woodwinds are commonly played such as a baritone woodwind or a student performance group. C is incorrect because a symphony is an entire piece of music that an orchestra or other musical group performs and a bassoon is only one note in the music, so no piece would be bad like that. C is incorrect because this is not the purpose of a bassoon. D is incorrect because this would either describe a high school band performance or it would describe a performance that was done badly such as a high school band performance.<n><n>### Input:(Takes 1.5 minutes for 10 people to eat at a restaurant.) A: 10 minutes B:15 minutes C: 120 (ten times ten) minutes D: 5 minutes E: 11 minutes<n><n>### Response:(11 minutes - Correct Answer)<n><n>### Explination:<n><n>Ten times ten is 100, but one minute is 60 seconds (0.1 x 60 = 6 minutes), so 10 x 10 would equal 60 minutes. A is incorrect because 10 x 60 is 600 seconds, and 10 x 5 is 50, not 100. B is incorrect, since 10 x 360 equals 3,600 seconds, which is 60 minutes. C is incorrect because 120 is not correct. D is incorrect because 5 x 100 is 100 while 5 x 3 is 15, not 50. E is correct because the wait time is 666 seconds.<n><n>### Example Solutions: (Write one line of solution like this)<n><n>When John, Samuel, Mark, and George went to a restaurant they ate for 10 minutes each. So the total time it took was 80 minutes (10 x 8)

If three people go to the movies and each get a box of popcum, how much does the box of popcum cost?<n><n>### The Family goes to the Movies (solution 3.9)<n><n>### Instructions<n>When a family goes out, everyone in the family buys something to eat that cost them $3.  On their table at the restaurant sat 5 boxes of candy canes. They have 17 boxes and each 17th box of candy cane is free. After counting them, they found they had 16 boxes of candy cane.  How many people were at the dinning table?<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>The problem is to find the number of people because the candy can was divided evenly among them. If the family has 16 boxes.  The first box of candy canes is free of price.  The price of the 1st box was already paid and they received it for free.  That way we find that we get 1/16 of the candy canes.  It means that there is (1/16 )16 boxes of cake. They did not have 16 boxes of free candy canes. And that means there is 16 - (1/16)16 or (3/16)12.  It means that for the price of one candy cane, you have received 3 candies.  That means (1-3/16) 16 = (16 - 2/16) = 15.  The 15th candy cane was free.<n><n>### Input  :There are 16 boxes of ice cream.  Choose a number (0 – 15).  The amount of ice cream eaten out from the box is the number you chose

The variable i has the value of 5 when it is first declared. If then i++ 5 times, this would be written as i+=5 5 times. So what this means is increase with 5 first, then 5 times, then 5 times again, and so on. The variable gets incremented by 5 each time the operator i++ is used, i.e. gets increased by 5 each time. In the second example, i-- means decrement. To be clear, this means to reduce the value of i by 1 each time the operator ++ is used, i. e. to reduce it by 1 each time, which is the opposite of i++.<n><n>### The if condition<n><n>The if expression (example a=5) is a comparison.

As you are researching a price for your frog, you come across a news article about the cost of keeping a pet frog.<n><n>### Question:In the article, the writer stated that many people keep their pet frogs in tiny tanks. These tiny tanks, though, make the frogs feel cramped. To keep the frog healthy in a confined space like this, frogs must be fed up to $25 dollars each week. These costs include the price of food and toys for the frogs.

Choices:  A: pond B: underwater C: aquarium D: lake superior E: body of water<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>Ice fishing can also be done surprisingly far from shore, provided there is just enough open water around an underwater ice shelf. In 1983, a group of scientists discovered a winter fishing camp nearly 50 miles from shore, which has since been named the Bodies of Water Lake Camp. The camp includes an ice shelf, a fishing tent, and a wooden fire place that's been used more than once for barbecues.<n><n>### Input:"The Great Lakes are the largest body of fresh water on Earth, providing habitat for hundreds of fish species. The ice fishing season officially begins in fall when water temperatures drop below 45 degrees F, and it ends in spring when the ice finally melts. But during much of the winter, ice fishing is possible thanks to open water surrounding portions of the Great Lakes. One of the most popular places to go ice fishing is Lake Ontario — home to more than 75 species of fish, including perch, whitefish and pike."<n><n>### Response:(Fall, Winter, Spring)<n><n>In the fall, ice fishing season officially opens as water temperatures begin to drop below 45°F. This time of year is also known as the ice fishing opener. When the water freezes, the ice becomes a solid surface that fish can travel across. This allows people to drill holes in the ice and drop fishing lines through them.<n><n>During winter, the ice on lakes and ponds grows thicker and stronger, providing a stable surface for fishermen to walk on. The colder temperatures also mean that ice fishing equipment must be modified for higher cold tolerance.<n><n>In spring, the ice melt begins and the ice breaks up into small floes. The floes move around under the pressure of waves and wind. This activity can displace fish and cause them to swim to deep waters where they become harder to catch. When the ice finally warms up and melts completely, people can once again enjoy the Great Lakes for their abundance<n><n>### Input : 45 + 20 + 30 = 90<n><n>The four numbers are 45, 20, 30, and 90.

There are 12 books. Each book contains 150 pages and is 150/12= $12.50. The first question was solved that way. The second question was solved by adding the prices of the books and the candy together. The total cost was $92.50. Then, the total amount of money received at the car wash was $500 less Brad's contribution. When it was calculated, it came to $40 dollars. This is all calculated the same way except the first question was not solved. The next question was solved by adding each of the values up and dividing that into the total cost to get the percentage. The total cost was 300, so it is 2.5. The final question was solved by adding 30 together 3 times, once for each of the numbers and using the same method to subtract for

It’s the safest place to keep the book and also if you loose the book at home you will get it back when you get more money from the bank.<n><n>**Note**: The question is asking about leaving your house for a job interview. So the account book cannot be put on the job because there you do not have a key, so putting the account book on your desk would not work, even if you had a lock. The book can’t be in your purse or bag because you are moving to a new job. Your accounts cannot be kept at an accountant because you are moving across the country for a job interview. You also cannot keep them with a bank because if you get a job and a bank, you don’t want to be a regular customer of the bank that you’re interviewing with. The account book cannot be kept at home because it is the opposite of the purpose of the interview.<n><n>### Input :You got an alarming amount of spam mail.

(If one would simply include the answer for each question as they typed it, any student that reads the instructions could quickly determine what the answer was for any question and thus would not even review the student's response.

The case called before him was interesting. A member of his village decided to sue a man in neighboring village for breaking a pig and a pen and a copper pot. In a farming community, people often had pigs. When the pig got to a certain size, the family would turn him loose and fatten him on grass growing in a local paddock. One fine fall day, one of the paddocks was visited by one of the most ravenous coyotes seen in that part of England in many years. He found the pig, tore him apart, and ate him, then turned to the pig's pen and tore that away from the supports and dragged it to the woods in one piece. Lastly he came upon part of the pig's copper water trough. He tore that apart and carried it off to a hidden spot.\n\nThe pig is gone, the fence is gone, and there is no sign of the copper kettle. How does the farmer in the village get his money from the farmer in the neighboring village?\n\n\n\n### Question:\n\nIn 1911 there were not quite 2500 airplanes in the world; in December of that year, there were 3700.

They would also like to be able to buy a book that will cost more than half of their daily income, but they want to spread their savings out equally. How old is the oldest student serving as the manager of the store?\n\n### Response 1:\nThis one doesn't seem so bad.\n\n### Response A: I see there has been 7 new employees since last Tuesday. Let's double that to 14 and half that by 4 for each shift so it's 44, and then I subtract each employee individually. This means there are a total of 14 employees. If the oldest employee makes about $150 per day, and $90 of it goes to rent, there's only about $60 for food per day after expenses. If you take out half of that, only $20 is left for each individual employee to spend on food, and if we split it evenly it only leaves each employee $10 per day to spend with the whole group. So... the oldest employee works part-time, maybe at McDonald's or something and the rest of their income comes from the bookstore....\n\n### Response B: Let's say they all get pay of $34, which can be found among their 20 employees. If they want to make at least $40 per day, they need to get at least 2 other people to sell $40 in books. Well, that's $60!

What is the total number of the legs in his farm if he 3 times as many goats than kangaroons?\n```\nIf he has 3 times the amount of goats as he has kangaroons, that means he has 2/3 the number total the amount of goats and cows.  Because he has 35 cows, you need to multiply the ratio of goats and kanguarous to cows.  So 2/3 x35 = 21.73\n```\n\n## 6.Input:Sarah, Mary, and Tua need to pay for a meal.

How much does each person need contribute to the bill?  \nLet's work this backwards to begin with:  We need to figure out how much did they each have to contribute to get down to $62.  So, Mary, Tuan, and Sarah had to add together and spend $105 between the three of them.  This means that each person needed to split $105 so $105 / 3 = $35.  But $35 / 3 = Mary $11.66, Tuan $11.61 and Sarah $11.73. \nBut Mary got a $5.00 coupon for $4 total and Sarah got a $6.00 coupon leaving the bill amount of $", "answer": "B: fridge"}

If you picked from the street of the child's the child could steal or scratch it.\nThe child will take the ball to a better spot to play.\n\n### Clarification:\nIf you were looking  for a ball it would be a waste of time to walk to the soccer match to take the same ball", "answer": "D: toy store"}

{"text": "A.\n\n### Response 2:\nB.\n\n### Responses 3:\nC.\n\n### Final Response:\nD.\n\n### Input\n\nJeremy is trying to write 1/4 of a number in his journal.  The process of learning to write fractions is much like learning how to write the number line. If he has a number line of length 12 inches, he can put a mark on the line that is 4 inches away from 0.  This place is marked by the fraction 4/12.  Next, he will use it as a reference when he writes down the number line, so this fraction will no longer be used.  He will move 2/12 mark forward on the number line for 2/12ths of the distance between 0 and 4/12ths.  He can write 2/12 on the line.  He can put the 2 as the numerator for 2/1)2 and then, because he's going to write the line in the opposite direction, he can write the denominator at the top to show where he is.  This fraction is read \"2/12.\"  Repeating the process for the next 2/12 will allow him to write a fraction that represents 1/4.\n\n### Output\n\nIn that case he could move 2/11 to the 2/12 fraction, using 2/12 as a reference point for how far he'll go.  He now writes 2/11 and puts the 2 as the top of the fraction.  He can then put the 11 on the floor in the same way that you might put an exponent on the floor when writing the fraction 2(11).\n\n### Input and output 3\n\nHe also wants to write a fraction that is 1/6th of some other number.  He can use the 1-12 line as a way to go from 1/4 to 1/6 in a series of steps.  Using what he knows about writing fractions to the 12th, he can find the fraction 1/6 as follows:\n\nFirst, he will write the fractions and the first 1/4, just as he demonstrated above.

When I joined this company as a new employee, I was given an opportunity to present myself and my expertise to the leadership team. I was asked to introduce myself and share what I would like to accomplish at my new role.\n\nI was extremely nervous and excited, but after some nervous laughter my co-worker and I sat down to try to gather our thoughts. We began discussing what our strengths were and how we could build on them to support our new goals at this company. As I sat there and spoke about the work that I did at my old job, I realized that I wanted to learn so much more. I didn't realize how the words that I used at that time contributed to where I am now. In a very short period of time, I was able to achieve so much more at my job. I have accomplished many things, but the one thing that stands out to me is when I asked my manager to write a letter of recommendation for me and when I got it back it was absolutely beautiful and very detailed. When I looked at the letter as I was reading it, I was able to tell that it captured the words that I used in my initial conversations with him.\n\nDuring our weekly meetings he often asked me what was going on with my job search. I was happy to tell Him everything that I was up to because I think that he knew how important this role was at such a great organization. He always had an encouraging comment about how happy he was that I was doing well and how the company needed people like me to grow and develop. Words can make such a powerful difference and I am so thankful that I found this role and I am so thank ful to all of you. You have made it an amazing place to work.\n\n### Notes:Notes:  In a very short period, I was able to accomplish a lot.\n\n### Response to Notes:Notes:In a very short period of 4 months, I was able to acquire a lot of knowledge and get some experience.", "answer": "B: better job"}

What do you know about her?\n\n## Solution:\n  * I don't know the right answer but I know that she ate a peach by multiplying once, and she ate an apple by multiplying four times. She's probably a mathematician or just a very experienced number-manipulator.\n  * I can tell that only two of these statements are true,  and so I know she didn't eat a muffin and probably not a cookie.\n\n## Question : What did the girl ate? What do you know?\n\n## Solution :\n  * First I tried the first step, the girl ate the apple. That was an incorrect step, so I tried the next most obvious thing since it's the first number she saw and it makes very little sense to choose a number like 5 or 6 because she has to multiply it at least once to be able to eat the apple. So I chose the apple and she ate it at some point.\n  * Then I chose the banana. This time it made absolutely no sense to just pick the next number since I already knew that she is actually eating something and not just picking a random number.

You can do things that are \"according to chance\" in several different ways.\n\nThis exercise will allow you to learn and then practice several of these ways for random number generation, in languages of your choosing.\n\nFirst, let's start by defining what we are trying to do. We will create a random number of a fixed precision.

I highly recommend you try at least two languages to keep things more interesting.\n\n(1) Python, (2) Javascript, (3) Actionscript, (4) Bash shell, (5) Ruby, (6) Visual Studio, etc.\n\n### Solution:\n\nCreate a code snippet for at least 2 languages. Each snippet should do the following:\n\n- Create a `int[]`\n- Set the precision to `10` (1 - 10)\n- Create a random number between 0 and the precision value\n- Set the number to a string\n- Test if your number is divisible by 3.\n\n### Sample answers:\n\n#### Python\n\n```\n>>> precision = 10\n>>> x = randrange(0, precision)\n>>> if x", "answer": "C: maps"}

When making decisions in her life what advice would Dorie's father give her? She is now 21. What would he have told her before she entered the seventh grade or the ninth grade? When she was seven years old?When she was\n\n### Response\n\n#### Advice from a father\nI have been a manager of many employees, it is extremely difficult to give useful advice to employees as a manager. The reason is that there is a vast difference in competencies between managers and juniors, and juniors may feel insecure or may be intimidated by managers. My advice would be first to let the juniors know the work style of me and the company. Then, I would give useful advice based on the differences in work ethics between juniors and myself. For example, when some juniors become disorganized, I would tell them \"we should work the way that a secretary in my company does.\" For example, when I work with a manager from another organization, I do not do what I cannot do such as using my secretary's telephone number but using mine or sending an e-mail without thinking about my message. That is a work style that is necessary for working with a colleague. In the workplace environment, I do not tell everyone that I follow this rule, but I tell colleagues who are not my juniors, such as managers from other departments and managers from businesses. My colleagues are likely to tell the juniors who are not my colleagues about this, and it will lead to the success in the relationship between me and the juniors. Thus, it is necessary to make the other person know the standards of your work before you give someones advice. An example is to share my rule with colleagues about using my secretary's phone number before handing over the tip to juniors.\n\n#### Advice between siblings\nI would give to a person who comes from a rich and powerful family the same advice as that for a boss from the other company. Basically, I would give useful and timely advice by considering the person's work style. For example, I would give helpful advice on work skills. I believe that these pieces of advice will influence the person'", "answer": "C: front door"}

For example, a track runner or a cross-country runner (or any other type of long distance runner) will perspire in humid environments whereas someone that plays a tennis match in a gymnasium will sweat similarly for different reasons.  The correct response should focus on how sweating is a common experience for people that runs for various distances.  \n\nOne can argue that runners feel other kinds of 'flights' and 'falls' as they exert themselves.  However, this is a question of perspective.  Flights can only refer to a bird or other flying creature that is used as a metaphor to denote a soaring and graceful activity, whereas 'falls' can also relate to an unfortunate incident or disaster.  \n\nFinally, trips can refer to a slip, stumble or a different kind of error.  \n\n### Instructions:Complete the task\n\n### Instruct:Sophia's favorite fruits are strawberries and kiwis.

{"text": "A. \n\n### Instructions: Write a response to the question below.\n\n### Problem: Dotty's favorite food is chocolate cake and chocolate chip cookie. She can eat 18 chocolate cakes and 160 chocolate chip cookies each day. Each week, she saves so much money, she can have  a soda each day, a fancy lunch once a week, and dessert when ever ever she likes. Her lunches are $5 each, desserts are $7 each and the soda is $2.50. What is the maximum amount of money, in dollars, she can save each week?\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Solution-Response:\nFirst, lets answer each food and see what we can say.\nChocolate Cake: The question states each week Dotty saves $367.50, therefore if she can afford 18 cakes we get 18 * $367.25 = $6764 (6764 cents/2 dollars =3382)\n\nChocolate Chip Cookies: The question states each 7 days she can afford 160 cookies, therefore 160 * $35 = $560 (560 dollars/2 - $1498)\n\nIf we add the savings of the chocolate cake which is 6764+560 we get 7324. The question says that Dotty can have a daily soda of 5 dollars. It is easier to count down the amount of money that Dotty is left with after the soda therefore we subtract 5 each day the amount left will be 7324 -5 (7324-5=7320)\n\nA fancy lunch means that each week she can have one for 5 dollars. Therefore we add 5 each week the amount left will be (7320+5*(1-1)) =7324\n\nDeserts are 7 dollars each, we add 7 each week it will be 7371 (7371+7*(1-1))\n\nWe finally get down to the money left with which is 7366+13", "answer": "A: do crossword puzzle"}

If all the friends are able to work together\non their assignment with one time each, then it would only take 60 minutes. However, due to\ntheir schedules which vary from week to week, one friend is busy each week and cannot work on\nthe assignment.\n\nThe amount of time each person needs to complete their assignment depends on the amount of\ntime each other person finished their assignment for that day. For example, if one person\nneeds another 30 hours to finish their assignment, so they work on it for 10 hours on Friday,\nthe other five people need another 3x25=75 minutes to finish their assignment. These 75\nminutes can be divided equally amongst the 5 remaining people so all people finish at 15\nminutes apart.\n\nThe problem can be approached recursively, i.e. if we have answered time needed for one\nperson then we need to know the time needed for the remaining people, and as we saw above\nthis depends on how much time the other people finished. We can calculate all the times\nnecessary for the remaining people recursively.\n\nSince the problem is recursive we must have a helper method that returns the previous\ncalculation (i.e. what time is needed by the helper). If we had a helper that returned the\ntime we first calculate we", "answer": "E: motorcycle"}

I hated school as a child and often dreamed of being homeschooled by my parents like my brother was. It wasn't that I didn't like school, it was that I didn't get it and it didn't get me. I didn't understand what math had to do with my life anymore than why I needed to know the name of every president or what a bill of rights was. The only times I was happy at school were the handful of classes I had with my favorite teacher. He taught us how to build a website, which felt so far off what we were learning in math class that I actually paid attention. He taught us how many types of websites we would need for an Internet startup (which I decided to call TeenTunes, in honor of my love for music) and how we would use HTML and CSS to build each one. I was instantly hooked, not because I was interested in what I was learning, but because that particular teacher made learning fun for me for the first time in years.\n\nLearning HTML and CSS, I was taught, was not a linear process. The path was complicated. There were more things I didn't understand than I did understand. I read documentation and researched and looked around at tutorials trying to make sense of it when all I ever really wanted to do", "answer": "C: state of union"}

How long will it take?\"\n\n### Response:\"The train will have to stop in Denver, where it will then travel at 45 m.p.h.\"\n\n### Input:'The train's original velocity was 125 mph. So, the train will be travelling at 125 m.p.hr once it has passed Denver. When you are looking at the math, think about the fact that any additional time it will take on the road is not necessarily taken into consideration. We will consider the original 125 m, plus the time it took in Denver as it's new velocity, and hence the final velocity.'\n\n### Input \"Hamlet decides to kill his uncle Claudius, who he believes is responsible for the murder of his father. Claudius\u2019 guilt is in fact real, but Hamlet\u2019s father, old King Hamlet, was an abusive and violent, if not mad, ruler. Hamlet\u2019s sister, old King Hamlet\u2019s wife, is in fact Claudius and Gertrude\u2019s daughter. Claudius believes that Hamlet\u2019s madness is an act and plots against him. Gertrude\u2019s reaction to being confronted by Hamlet on the day after old King Hamlet\u2019\u2019s death is to ask, \u2018What shall we do with the body? How shall we disguise the smell, that its very sight or sound shall seem Hamlet\u2019s ghost rather than Hamlet\u2019? What should Gertrude have done with the body?\"\n\nYou might think that a mother will do whatever it takes to protect her kids. But Gertrude doesn't. The Queen's answer to Hamlet tells us that she is concerned about appearances. In other words, she's more worried about her reputation than her child's safety.\n\n### Response \"Gertrude should have done nothing with her son", "answer": "A: holding"}

{"text": "Which of the four ways to engage in a pastime when traveling on liquid is most likely the correct answer?\n\n### Explanation:\n\nExplanation: When traveling along liquid, people are most likely to share things. People on a boat are together, and share food, which they may do with other boats in the vicinity. They share the water with other ships in the water, and would have to travel together in close range if they're racing. People on boats also share things from their boats to another boat. If they were having something, they would have at least one person hand their stuff to a person on the other boat. The only exception to this is fishing, which doesn't really count as a past time and people don't commonly learn from other boats about fishing.\n\n### Inputs\n\n### Mary had 89 stckers.

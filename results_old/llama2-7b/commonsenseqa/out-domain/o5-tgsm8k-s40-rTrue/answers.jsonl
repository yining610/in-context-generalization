{"text": "E\n\nInput: In the year 2007 the average cost of gasoline in the United States was 2.50 per gallon. The average amount of gasoline sold per gallon was 2. The sale price per gallon was 0.98. How much gasoline was sold in the year 2018?\nRationales::If the average cost of gas in the US was 2500 in 2007, the average amount of gasoline in the US was 3 in the year 2107. Given the average amount of gas sold per gallon was $2 in the year 2.50 and the sale price per gallon in 2018 was.98 you can conclude the sale price per gallons in 2000 was 1.04. This would give you an equation of (1.04/2.00)=$0.52. Which is close to the cost in 2017.", "answer": "B: refrigerator"}
{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions:\nSometimes, you might find yourself facing a question that does not have specific instructions but is left open-ended. Write a response that demonstrates your skills by appropriately completing the instructions.\n\n### Expected Response Format\nWrite a response using complete sentences.\n\n### Input Example:\nEvery morning, Sally goes to her local coffee shop, where she has been a frequent patron for six  years. She likes it so much she brings her colleagues there as well. The coffee house has two baristas who work full time, each making approximately 15,000 annual salary. \n\n### Explanation Text\nEvery morning, Sall is not happy because of the number of coffee that she need to consume. \n\n## \ud83d\udccc Questions\n\n### Input\nIf you eat a slice of pizza every day for one year, how many slices of pizza will you eat in a year? Choices: 16 slices of pizza. 512 slices of pizza 256 slices of piza 512 sliced of pizza \n\n### Output: 16 sliced of piza\n\n### Demand:\nInput: If you eat a slice of __________ of pizza every day ___________ a year, how many slic _____________ of pizza will you _________?\nRationales The last sentence contains a number 512. A number is a countable, so it would take plural form. This could be confusing if a person who is taking a standardized test were asked this question and they were not familiar with standardized tests. It's more likely to be something a person would see on a test because test makers generally test knowledge, so they will make sure to include specific grammar in their practice tests.\nThe last sentence contains a noun 512. Nouns are countable, so it takes plural form. A plural noun is formed by adding an S for all singular nouns and counting to the amount of that noun.\nThere is a rule in standardized tests that says that the number that is closest to the number of answers in a multiple choice questions should be marked. The question has two parts, and it's an answer choice that has four parts.", "answer": "C: bitterness"}

E:  You will be taller than you are now.\n\n\n### Response - Second Round:\nC - You will be 32\n\n### Explination:\n\nInput: Six years = 6 years * 1 year = 6 years\n    To double one's age, one must multiply by two. Since the time of today is 6 years (6 years * 2 years), then 6 + 6 + 6 = 19 years in the future will have doubled his age. \nThen take away the 1 year of current age and you get: years now = 19 - (1 year) = 18, which gives you 18 years ago\n    To get taller as a person, add 1 foot. Since the height of a person now is 1 foot, then add 1 foot to get 2 feet total. \n    Then divide 2 feet by 2 = 1 foot, divide 8 years by 2 = 4 years\n    At 4 years ago, you will be 4 units 1 feet taller = 4 + 1 = 5 feet tall\n    If you double 5 feet, then divide by 2, that is 2.5, then since you are 17 now, your age in the future will result as 32, which will have 2 times 8 units in height as a 17 years old person.\n\n#### Answer: (6 years from now) = 22 years\n(You", "answer": "D: being bored"}

If someone is watching a soap opera, what is the probability that someone who lives in a different city will change the channel?\n\n### Response\nBecause people who participate in spiritual events are more likely to switch channels when watching TV, the probability of someone changing the channel for a different city increases according to their religious beliefs.\n#### 19\nAnswer: 19\n\n### Demostration\nIn a random survey, 80% of people who watch soap operas  will change channels,  while only 5% of people who go to church will switch channels. Let's consider that in a population of 1000, 500 people watch soap operas, and 400 people go to church\nGiven two numbers: p and (n*p) + q\nn*p + q = p*n + q\nSince n*p+q = p*n +q, we are looking for the probability that someone switching channels from a soap opera in a different city would equal the probability that someone switching from attending religious services to someone switching from watching soap operas\nP = chance of someone changing channels from a soap opera to someone who belongs to a different city\nBecause p = 80% of those who watch soap operas and q = 5% of those who went to church.\nBecause p = ((500*80) + 400 * 5) = ((500 *0.8)+400*0.05)\n400*(0.05)+(500*0.8) = (0.45 + 0.4)\nBecause q = q = ((400*0) + 500*0) = (0 + 0)\nBoth events are equally likely, which means that this probability is 1/2\n2\nIn this case:\nP = 19\n\n#### 190\nAnswer: 100%\n\n### Demos\nIn a random survey of 2000 people, everyone who watches soap operas is more likely to switch the channel for a different area than non", "answer": "A: go to church"}
{"text": "A: roof\n\n### Rationale:\nChoices:  C: beach, D: closet, E: garage\nIn C: beach, we are not told that the school is too high or any size limitation. Hence we infer that the school is too wide/broad to accommodate the chair. Thus, the school must be too long. To find out how long the school is, we can multiply the length of the school by 8 (half of a foot). So the school is about 4 feet long, which leads to an answer of D.\n\nIn D, we can deduce that the chairs cannot be used in the garage because there is a ceiling and thus the chair cannot reach the ceiling. When this is taken into consideration, our answer is left with Choice B.\n\nIn B, we can easily see that there is a door. The problem here may be, that there may be too many doors in the school, which can mean students need to push against the doors to enter the school.\n\nTherefore, this leads us to Choice E because the garage door and the closet door cannot open at the same time, because they conflict with each other. Since the garage door cannot open at the time when the chair sits, we can say that  we can place the chair in the closet.\n\n### Choice 2\n#### \nAnswer: A: roof\n\n## Demonstration:You may have noticed that all of the questions had choices to answer them. For these questions, what the question wanted you to do is called \"eliminate the incorrect/unlikely options on the list.\" In the instructions, we can see all of the incorrect answers because they were excluded/not in the question.

Watch one hour of a sports program on television every night C. Read books about hurdling D. Run on a treadmill E: Meditate.\n\n### Rational: A boxer has a wide stance when he is running because he uses his wider stance as an advantage when jumping over hurdles. This suggests that the boxer should jump hurdles to improve at jumping.

In this case 15 matches out of 16 matches which amounts to 93.75% in the first choice and 6 matches out of the 15 choices which gives 40%.\n\n### Solution: A boxer would earn $70,000 in the first choice and $48,000 in second choice when both options are compared based on winning percentage.\n\n### Choice:A: Boxer 1: 9 matches out of the 9 matches won.\nB: Boxer 2: 6 matches out of B: Boxer 2 B: Boxer 7 matches won. \n\n### Boxer 1 earned 70,00 in the first instance and boxer 2 earned $48,0 in the second example.\n\n### So the option B is a better paying job as the percentage is higher than the first option.\n\n### In", "answer": "E: big house"}

As such, they are able to perform that art in their craft. However, for a \"master of their craft\", the word craft implies that they are not a master at a skill unrelated to this craft.

Also, murder is defined as the unlawful premeditated killing of another human being. By the fact that someone commits this, it is already vile to the victim. However, there is a way to write commit murder most vile as it says \"most\", meaning there is another option.

Being annoyed in this context means the people ahead of them were being loud, and that was annoying to the men.  Delays and Irritation can be substituted for each other.\n\nAnswer: The choice of answers: irritation works, because being annoyed means the children's loudness was causing the irritation.  Delay would not work, because delay implies something that hinders in general, not specifically something that is \"being loud\".  Being annoyed could work for that too, but what it says in the question is that they were specifically annoyed at the loudness.  Both delays and being annoyed leave the question completely unanswered.\n\n#### Irritation\n\nAnswer: Irritation\n\n#### Answer Explain\n\nSince annoying is a verb, it can be put onto anything, hence annoyed can be associated with anything.

Choices A. Play ball B. Play chess C. Play sports D. Play games E. Help around the house.\n\n### Response : Play ball or help around the house. \"independent\" or \"to be more independent\" can have the following meanings:\n\"not being dependent on another person or society to live.\"\n\"the ability to take care of yourself.\"\n\"being able to speak up for yourself.\"\nThe first choice implies that the parents are signed up for their children to learn to pitch or catch in baseball. The second choice implies that the parents want their children to learn chess. These choices are more aligned with teaching teamwork than independent.\n\n### Help around the house is the only acceptable answer as it fits in terms of being more independent. If the parents had played chess, it would mean they are trying to get their kids to do what they have done rather than what they should do. It also means that when the parents ask the kids to play chess, they have to have other activities in mind such as \"Play some cards or go for a walk\".\n\nFor the baseball choice, it would also mean the parents have never played sports before and have no idea how to play or pitch.

On Monday 8 occupied units moved out of the building and 15 occupied units moved into the building.  By Thursday there was an initial stock of 70% of its units being occupied.  How many units moved into and out of the building throughout the week?\n\n### Response :\nIf there were an initial stock of 100 units, then the remaining occupied units would be 40 and the sum to be used for the problem should be subtracted by 1. This means that the number of units moved in would equal to 25. Also, the sum of the numbers moving out would equal 56. Then the total number of units moved in and out should equal to 71.\n\n\n### Rationales:\n\nThe total amount of occupied units in the 100 units building would equal 60, since these would be the only occupied units left after it has lost 8. If 60% of the units were occupied initially, then it would have 60 / (100 * 1 / 3) = 20 occupied units by Monday. Since the initial number is already reduced, we do not need to include it.\n\nWe will count how many units there are left to use, since it is equal to the original number. For example, if there were 20 occupied units, this would equal 20 / 1 = 20. If there were 40 occupied units, the equation would be 40 / 1 =40. We subtract the initial number of occupied units remaining, 25. This number needs to be subtracted from the number", "answer": "B: fridge"}

{"text": "A: strength\n\n### Explain your choice:When he was a teenager, his arm was broken and then he got poliomyelitis. He was unable to walk on his own. He got his name from the cartoon character Popeye. He was born without legs so he is paraplegic. He didn't become a celebrity until years later. He always kept his spirits up. He is a member of Team Hoyt. A few years after losing his legs he played softball. He became a wheelchair athlete. In 1956 he graduated from the Winston Salem State Teachers College which is now Winston Salem University. He is currently an author and speaker. He started the Dick Hoyt Foundation. He got a doctorate degree in education. He has received much recognition, including having a race named after him, the Hoyt Challenge Half-Ironman.\n\n### Rationales:In answer choices A, B, C and D, we don't need to use reasoning to determine whether the choices fit with the description given. The description states, \"People always talked child like to him\" so \"A: strength\" (which means he has a strong body) is the correct answer.\n### Input:The number of Doers in the dining room is 3 more than the number of Players in the dining area.

The letters A through E are given in the illustrations.\n\nInput: The letter E is one-half the distance from the letter A. The letter B is in the exact middle of the letter A. The distance from the letter B to the letter E is 15 inches. The letter D is 20 inches to the right of the letter B. The letter A is 20 inches in length. The letter C is two-thirds the distance from the letter D to the letter B.  What is the  length  of the  letter  B?\n\n### Demostration:\nDistance from B to E is 15, so B-E=15\nLet ABCD and BED be segments and AC=CD and AB=BD, then the ratio of segments DE/AB is the ratio of the lengths given by AD/CD and AB/BD.\nThen the ratio of lengths is 15/20=3/4, so BED is 3/4 of AC.\nB ED is 3/4 AC, then segment ED is 3/2 of AC\nDistance from B to D is 20, then B-D=20.\nThis could be used to find BD or ED. But to find BD, we need to divide BD by ED (which we already know), giving the result of 5. Then BD=5ED. Since the triangle BDE is isocronous, BD is also 5ED which we know, so BD=10ED. BD is 10ED, or 5ED+5ED and the sum of the two is 10ED. ED is 10ED/10 and substituting this into the problem, we solve for BD, which is 5ED. B is 5ED, or 5*3/4*15 which is 12.5 inches.\n\nTo find the length of BD, since it is 5ED, it can be solved using ratios and proportions.\n5:20=3:4 and then 1:1=2:3 so", "answer": "B: california"}

{"text": "Option C\n\n#### C\nAnswer: C\n\n### Input \n\nEvery hour the water level of the reservoir goes up 2 feet, starting at zero feet an hour prior to noon. How tall is the reservoir 8 hours past noon?\nRationales- 8 hours past noontime, which is 8 hours after noon, means that is 8 hours after 10 o'clock in the morning. One hour after 10:00 is 11:00, which would make the time 11 hours after noon. After this point, the time will be 12 hours after noon, which would make it 12 o'clock. However, 12 o' clock is noontime, which means it has already passed by the time we would be checking the height of the reservoir. By rearranging the time in this form we can know that 8 hours past noonday means it is 6 hours and 20 minutes past noon. If we were to find the times after noon, we could set it equal to the number of hours past noon, and find out the answer as a result.\n\nThis will work for every hour as well. The question asks us to use a starting point at 10:01 am for a height of 0, and we continue to add 2 feet per hour. To do this we should use multiplication equations (2 * 8) and addition (8 + 1). The answer will also become a fraction (two and one-half).\n\n#### 8 hrs past noon\n\nAltogether, in 8 hours the water level goes up from 0 to 8*2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet\n#### Addition\n\nAddition:\n\n16 + 1 = <<16+1=17>>17 feet\n\nDivision: \n\n17/2 = <<17/2=8>>8 feet\n\nFraction- 2+1/2 = <<2+1/2=3>>3 feet\n\nRationales:\nSince the reservoir's level is an addition and each addition has two fractions, in total, the reservoir' will become a fraction with the number of fractions being three\n\nAddition 2+", "answer": "E: wasted time"}

Then 9 less than x is 9-x'. As x' is less than 18, we will assume that x<18.\nAs x<18, 9<x<18. So, x-9<18.\nSince, x'<18, we have -x <= -18 - 9. Therefore, x<=18-9.\nTherefore, if x is less than 10, the greater between -x and 10 has to be x.\nIf x is greater than 10, we have to evaluate -x and x.\nIf -x is greater than 18-9, it corresponds to x'<9 and is impossible as x' is not known. Now evaluating x, we have -18-9<x<10, which means that -x and 18-9 are less than or equal to x.\nIf we consider -x and 11, we get: -9< -x<11. And here, -x>-9 is not possible as x' is unknown. Hence, 11 corresponds to x.\nNow, our answer is: if x<10, the greater b/w -x and 1e has to be x, while if x>10, the greater of -x and 13 is 13.\n\n#### 23\nAns: 13\n\n### Input A bird in the sky flies at a speed of 3,500 feet per hour.

Return the number of days that remains on the test based on the number of days since the beginning of the test.\n\n### Example 1:\n```javascript\nfunction testMath() {\n    let daysTillTest = 30;\n    let remainder = 0;\n  if(daysTillTest < 7) {\n    remainder = daysTillTest;\n    } else {\n    remainder = 7 - daysTillTest; \n  }\n  return remainder;\n}\n```\n## Example 2:\n```javascript\nconst howManyDaysLeft = (daysTillTest) => {\n    if (daysTillTest-- < 7) { \n  return daysTillTest\n  }\n return daysTillTest + 7\n}\n```\n\n### Solution:\nThe second example was more effective because it takes out the number of days for each check mark. The answer to the riddle would be 3 days instead of 30-2 = 28 (rounded down). \n\n### Riddle:\nOne day at midnight (12AM) one number is doubled.The next day when 12AM rolls around that number is split 50/50.The next day when the clock strikes 12AM, multiply that number by 2, double the number again.The day after you take the square root or division by root of 4, add them together and subtract 1.What number do you end up with?\n\n### Expectation:\n3410\n\n### Solved:\n35 + 1(2)*35 = 101", "answer": "E: eat corn"}

{"text": "B\n\n### Rationales: If the garage had light sensored and automatic doors, then it probably should have a computer room, an automated kitchen with automated cooking devices, and an elevator with an automated door opening system (not to mention automated window closing and locking devices).  The garage probably also had some technology which automated a security system, a temperature system, parking system, driveway cleaners, power generation devices, and any kind of gadget the owners wished or needed for.  The same rules probably apply to the house.  The house would still have windows, doors, an alarm, an electric system, a heater, AC, pipes, and an insulation system which probably needed to be automated.  The house would undoubtedly have a security system and an automated cooking device with an automated kitchen.  Automated driveways, automated parking systems, automated car washers, and automated car lifts may also be installed.  Automated elevators might be optional.  The house may have more exaggerated interior technology, such as automated lighting systems, automated closets and drawers, automated faucets and dishwashers, and automated appliances.  Maybe it even had a fully automated maid and butler service.\n####  C\nAnswer: C\n\n### C is the answer, because all the other choices are not possible. \n\n### Some other examples:\n\nIf the house had a fully automated electrical system, you could control it from anywhere through smart devices.

{"text": "(D ) I believe the appropriate answer is \"E\" (McDonalds). Firstly, it is important to note that McDonalds does not sell contraceptive devices for a number of reasons. Primarily, McDonalds has no such devices, and would not likely sell other products as an unlicensed health care provider in a way that would jeopardize business or the health of their consumers. Secondly, pharmacies can dispense contraceptive devices with a prescription from a health care provider, but this would likely require an examination, a form to be filled out by a patient, and a prescription from their doctor. Pharmacies are not as publicly accessible as McDonalds. Finally, the answers B and C mention the sale of contraceptives for personal use, which is a topic for a medical professional to decide. The answer A cannot be correct because a pharmacy cannot dispense a prescription without filling out a form.  This means that contraceptive devices cannot be given on sight. They can only be given with a prescription written out by a health professional.\n  \n\n### Input and Response:\n(Answer D) I believe the appropriate answer to this question is a person. The answers C, D, B, and E, are all incorrect. Drugs are only required to be kept in a certain temperature inside a pharmacy. As McDonald's has no temperature control over it's products that are served, it would not be appropriate. A person is also incorrect due to the fact that that would give the wrong concept of McDonalds.\n \nA bedroom is incorrect because it is inappropriate for a fast food restaurant to have contraceptives there. Finally the answer D cannot be correct due to the fact that McDonald's only sells food. Also, it does not sell other accessories in it's kitchen, and it does not sell contraceptives because it is against the law.\n\n\n### Instructions:\nThis question requires selecting answers from four given choices.

{"text": "A\n\n### Answer:  A\n\n\n### Input\nFor Questions 6 and 7 below, explain your thinking step-by-step as you complete each part of the problem. \n\n### Demo:\nIn 1971, when David Steward was fresh out of college, few people took chances on black men who wanted to run their own businesses. But that is exactly what Steward did, and through his company, World Wide Technology, he has become one of the richest African-Americans in Missouri (estimated net worth: $500 million). Steward was born in St. Louis in 1949 to parents who lived on farm subsidies. His father's work in the cotton fields was difficult and his mother was often sick. Steward left the farm when he was 11, settling with his grandparents. At 21, he went to work, as a janitor for $1.95 an hour.  World Wide Technology was established in the basement of Steward's home. He borrowed money, took out a second mortgage on his house, and began to invest his money in computers. His wife, Pat, worked at the McDonald's where she made $1.65 an hour. When she was offered a better-paying job in engineering, Steward encouraged her to take it. While he was struggling to build a business, World Wide Technology was doing well. Steward, the oldest of nine children, gave his siblings a chunk of the business and eventually, they became board members. In 1989, Steward took World Wide Technology public and in the 1990s, he invested a large part of his fortune in real estate. In 2017, Steward sold control of World Wide Technology to three insurance executives for $6 billion. So far, it appears to be a lucrative deal for all.\n\nIn 1989 World Wide Technology was public. It means that the company was established in 1989.\n\nIn 2017 World Wide Technology was sold. It means that the sale occured in year 2017.\n\nWorld Wide Technology was established 27 years prior to 1989 when it was sold.", "answer": "C: inspiration"}

Her patient, seated at 53 degrees next to the doorway has 24 feet to walk before reaching her destination. If the nurse moves at 2 feet per minute, how long will it take the nurse to walk and greet the patient?\nRationales:(Patient's doorway angle / Nurse's doorway angle) * Distance Traveled Per Minute * (1 / (Patient's Movement Speed Per Minute)) = Time To Greet Patient\nSince the doorway angle is 45 / 53 = <45/53=0.83>>0.83, then time to greet patient can be shown as Time = Distance/((Movement Speed Per Minute)(Angle))\nSince the patient can walk 12 feet (53 / 4.56 = <53/4.56=> 24>>24) in 1 minute (1 / 4.5 = <<1/4.5=1/12>>1/12 minutes), then the time can be shown as Time=Distance/(SpeedPerMinute/Angle)\nThe distance walked by the nurse can be shown as Distance=Time X MovementSpeedPerMinute\nSince the distance walked by the nurset can be proven to be (0.83 * 2) + (0.83 + (53/4.6) * 2), so it can be shown as Dist = (0.83*2) + (53 / 12) * 2\nSince Dist = 13.07 + (53 /12) * 4\nSince Dist = 706.73 + (0.45) * 16 <Dist>\nSubtracts Dist and moves to answer  Dist = 13 + 0.45 Dist = 13+0.45\n\nThe answer is 706.4.\n\nAnswer: 706.21", "answer": "D: elderly person"}

Middle Ages art often features battle scenes, and knights are almost always depicted on the battlefield, which would be a more interesting setting than a fairytale or castle.\nKnights, being an extremely masculine group, would be likely to be drawn into the field of chess, but it is unlikely they would be placed on a dollhouse, which is a small plaything for girls; instead, a knight would be much more likely to be represented in a battle scene where he is fighting against a large variety of foes and opponents.\nThus, the image of the knight would more likely be found on a castle, which features a plethora of enemies for the knight to defeat, as the castle is a prominent aspect in medieval society and culture and houses many of the knights' enemies such as dragons, giants, and many other fantastical foes.\n\n**E:** As the knight is a representative of a medieval soldier, it is likely that he would be drawn to places where medieval weaponry is on display. To represent the battles that these soldiers fought in, many museums feature a medieval battle display, which would be a fitting venue for the knight to appear.\nFurther, as the knights of the Middle Ages wore armor as the main form of their armaments, they would likely be found at events such as festivals or fairs, which are typically attended by people dressed in a variety of different medieval costumes. These knights could then take the opportunity to showcase any weapons not currently on display in the museum.\nFinally, in the midst of these medieval festivities, it is likely that the knight would be found at a Renaissance Faire, where the knight's armor is on proper display and the knight himself is able to show off their skills and abilities.\n\n\n### Demand:\nWrite your responses to the questions below.

How much money did she have when she started?\n\n### Demination: This is the number 2289 in word form: Two thousand, Two hundred, Ninety. \n### Demotion: In order to find the number, follow these steps:\n\n##### 20x209= <<20x200=4000>>4000\n##### 4000+100= <<4000+0=4100>>4100\n##### You have 4100 as the number.\n\n### Rationales: The woman started with $<<$41>>41 in her bank account. And every month, she adds 10 $<<$0.10=0.10>>0.10 cents so she has $<<$41*1.1=50.50>>50.50 to her account. $<<$50.50=210.50>>210.5\nSince she always adds the amount every month, she would have double the amount after 2 month, so $<$210.5*1.2 >>331.04\nAnd after 4 months, she would have four times more money than she started and she would have $<$331.05*1.4>>458.89\nAnd after 6 months she would have $<<$458.9>>613.31\nSo you add the $0.10 from the first month to each month until you reach 6 months, you reach your answer of $613.30.\n\n### 5087\nInput: Which one?

{"text": "The dictionary should be placed on the shelf\nDictionaries are reference books. Dictionaries are large books which can contain tens of thousands of entries. They should be in a shelf where they are easily accessible if needed. Dictionaries do not require any regular maintenance like books in the library or textbooks in the classroom. This is because dictionary users rarely consult them regularly. Since they are reference books, they contain entries that do not change over a period of time. As such, a reference book such as a dictionary can be kept in a shelf.\n\n\n### Input 1:Where would you put an unfamiliar book that you don't think you will need again? Choices:  bookshelf  library\n\n### Response 1:It should be put in the bookshelf\n\nSince the book is an unfamiliar book which you do not think you will need again, you may not know anything much about the content of the book. It may even be a collection of recipes that you once browsed through and found the one that you needed. If you place an unfamiliar book anywhere in the library, chances are that the book will be misplaced soon after since you are putting it somewhere you don't think it belongs. Since the book is unfamiliar, it is likely that you do not remember its title. If the book is in a shelf that contains books that have the same title, it will be difficult to find the title because someone may have moved the book after borrowing it.  Instead, it should be put in the shelf in a designated shelf for unfamiliar books. This will help to keep your unfamiliar books in one place so that they can be easily located.\n\n\n\n\n### The answer must be a complete sentence containing an independent clause.

If Fred's 12 more, then twice twice that number is 16 more since twice twice a number is 4 times the number. 16 more than 3 is 16=<<16=50>>50+6=60 and this is a third of what Joe does.\n#### 60\nAnswer: ( 50, 10, 30, 60, 60 ) \n\n### Example B:\nAdd one-third to twice what Sam did.

A: The woman is 10 years old B: The son is 10 years older than the mother C: The woman is 25 years old D: The man is 25 years older than the woman, etc.\n\n### Rationales:\nSince we know that the son is 10 yrs older than his mother's age, we subtract his mother's age from his age, and we get half of the difference between the age of the son and the mother. We then multiply the result times 3, and we get 3/2 times the result is still less than the man's age subtracted from the son's age.

{"text": "A is the correct answer. Passengers can use  electronics during flights, but before they do passengers are asked to turn off their electronic devices. So the time that you cannot use electronics on planes is during takeoff  and landing. The time you need to wait is when the plane is about to take off, or when it is about to land. For example, when you take an airplane to  Hawaii, there might be a 1 hour delay at the airport before you can get on the plane.\n\n### Inputs:\n**Input B:***\nWhat do people do to spend time on an airplane before using electronics?\n**Choices:  ***  A: read  B: passenger C: fly D: land  E: buy tickets***\n\n### Response B:\nB is the correct answer. While waiting to be able to use electronics, some passengers do read books and magazines.  Passengers can also take a walk, or sleep, or take a nap if  they arrive at the airport at around 5 am and they have a long  flight ahead of them. There are also airports that have book stores or magazines inside airports that passengers can read for free.\n\n### RESPONSE:\nC. I chose the answer C because while people are flying a flight, a person does not fly a plane by  themselves. They do not control the plane by themselves when they fly  in an airplane. A pilot controls the plane while passengers are doing the work. There is another group of employees in the cockpit to assist the pilot.

If the client\u2019s goal is to sell this product to male buyers between the ages 18 and 20, and the most effective advertising strategy is to target males between 18 and 30 years old, the client should advertise this product to buyers between 18 and (blank) years old.\n\n### Rationale: In order to sell products to customers, marketers have to decide which advertising approaches will best resonate with their audience. Depending upon the age, economic status, and lifestyle of consumers, advertisement can be effective or not effective in marketing. To determine the effectiveness of the advertisement, companies will measure the responses of different audience demographics. Accordingly, the most effective or least effective products can appeal to male audiences between 18 and the age of 30 and female audiences between 31 and 40 years old. In addition, when choosing different age groups and demographics, marketing companies also can have some choices. To appeal to a larger number of people, and to not overwhelm the target market, advertising companies can appeal to young male buyers between the age of 12 and 20. For young female buyers, marketing companies appeal to those between ages 12 and 9. These specific markets can provide different outreach and advertising strateg", "answer": "C: music room"}

{"text": "The input indicates that moving cars involves driving, getting tired, and accidents. It could also involve tickets, however.\n\n### Input\n\nInput: Find three consecutive integers such that no difference between any two of them is less than 3.\n\nOutput: The possibilities are (8, 9, 10), (10, 11, 7), (13, 15, 14). I think the first of these is by far the easiest to find.\n\n### My Solution\nWe need a sequence of three integers such that the absolute difference between any two adjacent element of the sequence is 3.\n\nWe can start with a sequence of three integers. Call them x, y, z. We now want to move each element by 3. A trivial example that doesn\u2019t match the specification is if we start with x = 8, y = 17 and z = 16 that results in x = 25, y = 20 and z = 15. We want a solution with y and z greater than z. Thus this trivial example doesn\u2019t satisfy the requirement.\nLet\u2019s try to find an increment of (8, 9). We set x = 8, and we need x + n to be in the sequence, so we let y = 9 - n. Next let\u2019s look at the next value in the sequence. We want y \u2212 (9 - n). If n = 0, then we have y \u2212 0 = y which is the next value, 13. Likewise if n = 1, then we have y - (9 - 1) = 10. What happens if n = 2? We get x + (9 - 2) = x + 7. This is a good candidate since we want x = 8 to be in the sequence so 7 < 8. This satisfies the spec, no?\n\nNow let\u2019s look at moving the sequence by 7. We set x = 25. The first possible choice for y is 17 \u2013 (7 - 0) = 17 -7 = 10. Can we use the value 10 in the sequence? The answer is no. If we do, then we\u2019ll need to have y = 6 with y - (7 - 0). If we do that", "answer": "A: driving"}

Similarly, 10 is common because.90 is 10% and.900 is 100%.  40 is twice 20 because 40-20=20 and 0.90-0.900=0.009.

{"text": "What is the best answer or explanation to the above question?\nWhere do  you store wine?\nA:  Attic\nB:  Basement\nC:  Art show\nD: Church\nE: Bar\n\n### Input and Rationale:\nDear Manager,\nI really need you to re-evaluate the way we store wine.  Here are my recommendations:\nA: We should move our wine into the attic.  We have already been having a hard time finding space for all of our items.  One of the reasons to choose that option would be to save money.  We could save money by not having to rent a separate storage space to store our wine.\nB: We should move our basement.  Whenever we get a large amount of wine, it starts piling up because we don\u2019t have a proper storage place.  If we moved it to storage on the basement 9 floor, it will be harder to make and we will be more likely to have a space to  keep all of our wine.\nC: If we store it in our attic, it will look great because we will be able to make an art show with all of the empty wine bottles.  Also, if we store it on the basement it will be too dark, meaning we wouldn\u2019t be able to see all of our wine.  That is why we should do the attic.\nD: We should store it in a church.  In a church, we will be able to keep all of our wine safe and sound.  We will also be able to keep it dry and away from any other  objects that will harm it.  This means that all of our wine will stay in the\n\nsame place, for a long, long time!\nE: If we store it at a bar, the staff will be able to choose from a variety of different wine.  If we store it in different locations though, then we won\u2019t know which one is the best one because that one\u2019s wine bottles will have gone missing!  What else could go wrong?  We should store it in our wine cabinet!\n####  A\nAnswer: A\n\n### Input\nI am very interested in  the internship position you are advertising.\n\n### Rationale:\nI am writing  to let you know that I am very interested in your internship position at your company.", "answer": "B: basement"}

What was the total number of stethoscopes Dr. Banks gave?\nRationales : If the total number of stenthoscopes was x, and the number of stenthosocpies given to patients was y, if we take both to be our denominator, then x-17+y=<<x+y>>x\nThe stethoscopes given by Dr. Banks for the clinic would be x, because x is greater than y which is the number of stenthocopies given to patients.\nBecause the denominator isn't very large, we can solve x-17+x. Because x is greater than y, or y<x, x-17+17 would be greater than x, so the result would be x+x=<<x+x>>x and the answer to the question would be 1\n\n#### Answer: 1\n\n### Inputs: For every hour on Tuesday, it was 3 times as hot as Monday.", "answer": "C: marriage"}

{"text": "A. Very Ugly\n\n### Instructions:\nPlease select 'A'\n\n### Rationales:\nMost people think of models as looking beautiful, but the truth is that models are not beautiful. The modeling industry wants people to think models are beautiful and therefore models have to be beautiful. If one goes to the extent of becoming a professional model there is a very slim chance of getting a chance in the industry as the industry is flooded and only models of a specific appearance make it in the industry. As models they have to wear makeup for long periods of time and this may lead to skin damage. They also have to wear high heels which leads to physical pains. Models also require a strict diet which may lead to depression with the constant reminder of always being on a diet. They have to look beautiful all the time and be physically fit too, something impossible if you are not born a model. They might get selected for a couple of shows which eventually may lead to rejection because of their appearance. People do not know that only the ones chosen are considered as beautiful whereas in reality most models are not beauty personified. Being a model means suffering depression, abusing drugs, and many other things.\n\n### Input\nInput:\nHow important do you think it is to get into the modeling industry?\n\n### Response\n\nIt is important to get into the model and the reason behind the importance of entering modeling is that one always goes for a job that pays lots of money as this becomes the motto of our lives. Also the chance to be a model must be high as many aspire to be one but not all, the important aspect is to appear beautiful or have the charm that can make people drool over you.\n\n### Rationale\nBecoming a model is only about becoming famous and making money. For this you do not require any beauty or talent. You need only one thing, the charm that makes you look beautiful to the world.\n\n### What is the probability that the student\u2019s final letter will not be D or H?\n\n### Instretctions:Answer the following.\n\n### Response", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

The smaller number multiplied by the larger number is 4 times the larger number. Find the larger number.\"\n\n### Response:\"Choices: A: 45 C: 15 D: 25\"\n\n### Rationale:\"A is 1/6 smaller than B. The smaller number, A, can be written as B*0.16. This will be equal to 4 times B if it is divided by 2, because you would just have to divide the number B by the amount of times it is under 1/6 to get the value B*0.1.

According to this informative article from the National Center for Education,  wildfire is defined as \"a fire in a wildland area caused by natural sources and burning in the uninhabited areas of the wildland-urban interface.\" Another way to interpret the term is wildfire can refer to \"a fire that is uncontrolled and has not been caused by humans.\"\n \n#### Wildfire\nA natural, uncontrolled fire that has not been started by humans is commonly known as a wildfire. \n\n#### Wild\na land area that is not inhabited or built on \n\n#### Fire\na huge flame or a sudden burst of heat, light, or energy\n\n### Question:\nWrite a response that explains which one of the four following items from the lesson best fits the definition of the topic.\n\n## Response\nFour-dimensional geometry has been used to describe and determine the best strategies for landing on the moon.

The witch gives the king a test and says \u201cI can grant you three wishes, and the one who comes up with the best wish will be the king\u2019s adviser and will be offered as tribute every second day.\u201d The king thinks for a second and says, \u201cPlease show me your best and worst wish so I know what to expect.\u201d The witch thinks on it and gives a wish that makes everything green and another that makes everything golden in addition to creating a bridge to get across the river. The king is impressed. The king asks what the worst wish would be. The witch thinks on the worst wish and says, \u201cI would wish for the castle to be filled with candy.\u201d Now the king is excited and thinks. The king thinks on his best and worst wish, but then realizes that he hasn\u2019t made a wish yet. He decides to wish for the witch to take him to the kingdom of pumpkins at the bottom of the river. The witch wishes to take the king to the kingdom of pudding and the pudding falls all around the castle. Now the king is stuck and has no way of reaching any of his wishes. What is the title of the wish for the kingdom of pumpkin?\n\nRationales:\nThe witch gives the green wish and gold wish to the king and wishes the bridge across the river at the same time. Since there is no way the king can be king without leaving the castle, this means he would go back to living with a mother and father, with no wife.\nSince the king wouldn't have a wife, he wouldn't have a child and cannot be the king, which means the other adults would become the king and queen.\nThis means that the king would not have any wishes so he wishes for the witch to leave\n#### C\nAnswer: B\n\n### Input and Response:Miranda can eat 5 meals total.

Misunderstandings refer to a failure to come to an agreement or understanding, and misunderstandings do not cause frustration. So when there's a misunderstanding, it's not that you failed. But, in the context of a full immersion environment, the idea of mistakes can be scary. Miscommunication is scary because if someone gives you incorrect information it causes you to form misconceptions about the world around you.

It's clear to most of us who are not used to reading math word problems in the real world that stitch and patch are two different things (or are they? I've been doing math wrong this entire time? I must be a stupid dufus). After thinking long and hard about the question, I found what seemed like a clear answer: though Sally made the job cut years ago, its scars would never heal. The scars from making the cut years ago are literally the cuts on her resume that Sally took (I thought of this only after seeing choice D because I was fixated on the possibility of figuring out what scars had to do with seashells) to improve her chance of making the job cut in years to come. The scars were open wounds in the beginning, but they have now healed (which is why they say figurative), leaving behind a scar as proof.\n\n#### Rationale part 3:\nI thought the whole scenario was interesting because it made me think about my past. I found myself asking if I have scars from past jobs. I hope not. I hope, instead, that I have an impressive resume. But if I, like Sally, made a job cut before but eventually got hired (and am therefore happy enough to have a place to work), does that mean my past job choices were a scar? Is this why so many young people never get to choose what they want to major in and instead pick a safe one like business or education or nursing when they're told it's the best way to get a job? It made me wonder if Sally made the job because it was safe, or if it was her calling in life. This, too, confused me. After all, her calling is to be a seashell collector", "answer": "D: heal"}
{"text": "C\n\n### Input Question:\n> Who was the head of the library yelling at: A owner, B foot, C subordinate, D base, E point.\n\n### Input Answer(s):\n> E. Point.\n\n### Response(s):\n> C. subordinate\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe sentence mentions that \"A head of the library yelled at a subordinate\".\n\nIf the answer is B. Foot, The sentence should have said something to the effect of the head yelled at the foot.\n\nIf the answer were D. Base, The sentence would have been \"The head of the base yelled at a subordinator\"\n\nIf the answer was E. Point, The sentence would have said \"The head of the library found a mistake made by a subordinate\"\nSince the sentence doesn't include any of those three items, \"point\" should be discarded.\n\nIf the head of the library was a member of the staff, the head should have been yelling at either the owner or the foot.  Subordinates can't be both points and subordinates in the sentence structure.\n\nIf the sentence could be rephrased as saying the \"base of a library found a mistake\", the head of the library would have been said to be a subordinate (base), and therefore A. cannot be the answer.\n\nE can only be the answer if the subordinate were a point in the sentence, though, since the sentence is trying to express that the head of a branch yelled at the subordinate, not a point.\n\nAnswer choice C subordinate is therefore the answer\n\n### Rationales:\nThe head yelled at a sub-ordinary. We are looking for a word that is associated with the head and the word has to do with yelling and not sub-ordinary has to do with yell (yell).\nTherefore, A is not the answer because the head is not a owner and owner is not a type of work that a head does.\nThe head is not a foot either. The head is not a base because the branch is not a part of a branch but rather the branch is a part of the library. The head cannot be a point because the head is not the library that is yelling but rather the library has a head.\nTherefore B,C,D,E cannot be the answer.", "answer": "C: subordinate"}

To have enough for 21 days we need 5 gallons a day and 50 gallons total to be on the safe side. So 50 gallons for 21 days means to get 50 gallons over 36 days you must use 1.4 gallons day.

At a red light, a driver will stand at either a fork in road or at a street corner or a city street.\n\n### Response 2:\nDue to the complexity of this intersection, the probability distribution depends on the location of the observer. If an observer chooses to stand near the intersection, he/she will likely choose either a city street or a fork in road.

The pet store sold 4 dogs in all to the same price per dog.  If it cost $97 to buy both of her dogs, how much did each dog cost per pet?\n\n### Rationales:\nEvery dog costs $49, no matter how many dogs you buy per pet. If each dog costs $49 and Susan purchases two dogs, they cost $1,000 between the two of them. Thus, Susan paid $29 more for the second dog compared to the second one. She paid another $38 for Daisy, and another $47 for Dory. If she bought one dog, she would have paid $98, and no matter how many she bought after that, the third would cost her $49.

How many out of 100 competed in the second test?\nRationales : The denominator is less than the numerator, the second test has to be less than 2.5%. Divide 2.5 and the remainder is 21.\nThe question states that the number of test takers in the second test is less than 2.6% of all competitors (who did not finish). Therefore, we know that 2.6% is greater than 25% or 86 > 25%. We know that 21 is less than 86, making 2.6% less than 25% as the question states. If the number of test taker in the second test is 86, then we know that 25% of the competitors did not finish (100-86).

I told him that the best way to improve his stamina is to build up his endurance through a gradual increase in running distance. So, I set a total of 9 exercises in four weeks and had my brother write all the exercises he was going do on the calendar that was attached to this instruction.\n\n### Response One:\nEach day my brother chose to increase the distance and time he ran while adding speed. When he started off he was running 3 miles for the first week at a 15 minute pace. Then he went to 3 miles for the second week with a 18 minute pace. Then he ran 6 miles for the third week with a 21 minute pace. Then he did 6 miles for the fourth week with a 23 minute pace. Then he hit the final stretch, 9 miles with a 25 minute pace.\n\n### Analysis and Critique\nIn order to increase stamina and endurance, a runner must exercise at a level higher than their baseline. When running, it is imperative to build up stamina slowly so as to avoid injury.\n\nMy brother wanted to accomplish both stamina and endurance but was only able to increase endurance.\n\n### Answer:\nIn order to increase endurance, the runner must improve their speed.\n\n### Example Exercise Two:\nEight less than three times the greatest number and three times the greatest number are equal to 70.

The word drugstore is more of a slang term for a drug store.\n\n#### B, C, D\n\n### Demo:-\nWater is a liquid, and it can't be sold; it cannot be a good place to buy a moisturizer; in water, moisturizers will do nothing.\nPeople who carry moisturizer with them are people who are in the market for them, because they are on the go. People who buy moisturizer in a public restroom are people who forgot their moisturizer. This is because they are in a private area.\n\n#### D, B, A\n\n### D\n\n### Rational:\nA purse is a piece of clothing, which is not a place to buy moisturer.\nHand lotion and moisturer are two names for the same product; so saying them in a question isn't necessarily a good idea.\n\n### Input:-\nIf I have five dollars and I am buying one pizza, which of the following combinations of numbers of quarts of poutine should I buy to spend my five dollars?

The first friend chooses a 6-sided die, and the second friend rolls a 7-sided die.  What is the probability that the first friend wins?\n\n### 16 / (6 + 7) = 16 / (13) = 12 / 6\n\n## Rationales:\nWe will start with the odds in the case where the first friend wins and the second person rolls a 1. The odds in the case that the first person rolls a 6 are the same as the number of ways to roll a 6 when rolling a 7-sized die. The number of ways to roll 6 is (6C4)/26, where  there are (6C4)/(a!b!,) ways\n\nThese are the odds of first friend winning, multiplied by the odds of 2nd person rolling a 1.\n\nFor an equivalent formulation...\n\nLet's say first friend wins if they win on the first try and lose if they don't win on the first roll. Then the odds of first person losing is  when they lose on the first try.\n\nNow, for each trial on which they win, the chances of them winning in the next are  for each of of the chances of losing in the next.\n\nLet's count the probabilities for each trial where first person wins once and los", "answer": "E: celebrating"}

{"text": "If you said the answer was E, sweat, you are right!\n\nInput: In a week of camp, the students only have one day where it doesn't rain. If it were to rain two days out of the week, how many days of camp would have at least one day of precipitation (rain or snow)?\nRationales: There are 7 days in a week, each with the same probabilty that it will rain or snow eachday. Therefore, there is a 10% chance that it will rain or some other way precipitate on any day in the week.\nWe can think of this as the probability of it _not_ raining on any day is 90%\nWe can also write that it will rain 10% of the time (there is a 10/100 chance that it will rain on any given day).\nInput: On rainy and snowy days, students have indoor activities but the school will not close the school. If it only rains one day of a week or less, the school will close. The probability of it raining less than one day of the week is 20%. How many days of a week will the school be closed if it rains 7 days out of the week?\nRationales:[The logic is nearly the same as the first problem. Here, it is only two numbers that need to be set equal, instead of two different functions.]\nWe can think of raining on any given day as having a 20% probability. We want to know how many snow days will result in the school being closed, right?\nSnow days are on a day when it snowed. There is an 80% chance that it snows on any given day.\n8 days out of the week will snow, because these are the 8 days out of the first 7 in which it didn't rain (so the probability of the 7th day snowing would be 8/7 or 80%).\nIt snows on 0.8 or 80% of all snow days and on 0.2 or 20% of all rainy days.\nThis is also the same logic, but it is easier to see when it is graphed:\n\n| 0.2 |  | 0.8 |\n|---|---|---|\n| | | |", "answer": "B: aggression"}

Meeting a friend can lead to a friendship, which isn't necessarily what the question asks.

A saint is someone who is recognized for significant contribution to religion. Saints and martyrs are the people from the bible who were killed for their religious beliefs. During the early years of Christianity, the Catholic Church didn't recognize saints. This was due to the threat of emperor worship if people were made into saints. In 600 AD, a feast day was created to honor saints and martyrs, called All Saints Day or Hallowmas, held on November 1st. In 1236, King Frederick II honored a Franciscan friar named Francis of Assit who brought the worship of martyrs to Italy and was made patron saint of Italy. There is no written record that explains the exact roots of decorating Easter eggs. In Europe, painting Easter eggs has been celebrated for over 5,000 years. Ancient Sumerians were known to decorate the walls of their homes with animal drawings that could represent people. People believe that the tradition of painting eggs began when chicken eggs were used as a decorative spring ritual. Today, the eggs are decorated with symbols and images representing the sun.

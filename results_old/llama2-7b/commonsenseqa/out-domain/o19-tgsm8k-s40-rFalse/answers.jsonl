{"text": "A\n\n### Instructions\nThe acceleration pedal of a motorcycle is usually attached to the right side of the tank 25 cm before the handlebars.\n\n### Additional instruction\nWhen accelerating from full stop, the front wheel of a motorcycle lifts, which gives it good suspension for off-road.\n\n### Answer\n## Answer:\nThe answer is accelerator. An acceleration pedal (or throttle) controls the power output of a motorcycle.\n\n### Explanation\nDuring acceleration, both feet are planted on the ground. In a hand throttle (the left foot is on the ground, the right foot in the air), the throttle is held in a middle position and the bike\u2019s power is adjusted by the riders hand. A hand throttle gives the rider more precise control over power output by adjusting the opening.\n\n### Tip\nA motorcycle has two brake handles.  One brake helps to slow the motorcycle by slowing the back wheel and the other brake assists by slowing the front wheel.\n\n### Solution\nLet\u2019s break it into pieces (or phrases). This is from a practice exam and all these are multiple-choice questions. The correct answer is the single answer in a multiple-choice question. If it\u2019s \u2018D\u2019 or \u2018E\u2019, this means multiple answers may be correct. You\u2019ll get the score in the \u2018Questions Correct\u2019 column but no feedback for the missed questions.

I understand that the right-side of a hand throttle controls the power output of the engine. I understand that a hand throttle gives me more precise control of the gear. I demonstrate that I am aware of the handbrake of my car.

{"text": "E\n\n### Explanation:\nLet\u2019s work on this rationale: \n\n1. Because of the words \u201cwhat? Choices.\u201d  that implies that there is more than one choice, but later the sentence uses words that limit choices to either options for paying bills or keeping a house, which are the only two options that are possible since the bills and house have already been discussed in the sentence \u201cthe only reason he was act\n\n2. The choices that could not be the actual answer are \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d.\n\n3. \u201cA\u201d is obviously not the answer since it would be considered impossible at any point to pay bills and make money, even if they each come in different quantities.\n\n4. If \u201cB\u201d is the answer, then it would be considered impossible to consider the bills and keep a house at the same time.\n\n5. That leaves \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d to be the answer.\n\n### Input :  What's the product of 5 times 3 and three and a half?\n\n### Response :  E\n\n### explanation :\n\n1. Sometimes it felt like being able do what? to be able to do what??\n\n2. this rationale is used: If someone is saying what is the product of 5 and 3, then you can assume they are already familiar with multiplying numbers\n\n3. we only need to see whether \u201cthree and a half\u201d can be put as a single factor.\n\n4. it can if it is written as three and a half, which means it is a single factor.\nWe know that \u201cand\u201d means to add two things, but \u201cand a half\u201d is technically a fraction, so although it is not normally considered a single factor, it still works this time because the person was already talking about multiplying numbers, and the other way around would not be possible since the other choices would have to be in a multiplication problem, in this case, they would have to be two numbers.\n\n### If you had 124 cans of soup, how many cans would you need to add up to 237?\n\n### Answer: 4\n\n### Explanaition:\nLet\u2019s check if the choices are the only logical answer\n\nA: B: 1 = 4th word after the question", "answer": "D: making money"}

How many boars did the hunting group see in total?\n\n### Expected answer:\n35 (or 40 or 45)\n\n### Clean answer:\nThere are 4 choices. If the answer to \"how many deer did they see in the morning?\" is less than the answer to \"how much more boar did they see in the afternoon than the morning total?\" then the answer must be '35' (or 40).  If the answer to the first question is greater than the answer to the second question, then the answer must be \"35\" (or 40, or 45).\n\n### \n### Demonsturation\nIn the morning, the group notices 50 deer, and 10 boars.  In the afternoon, they notice 95 deer, and noticing 35 boars, they have not seen all the boars they noticed in the morning.  So they see 40 more boar in the afternoon.\n\n### Original answer\n\nThe answer is 35, for the same reason that a four would follow an \"A\", \"C\" and \"L\" (but not a three), and a nine would go after a \"H\", \"U\" and \"N\". \n\n### Why the answer might be 40 or 35, or 45 in the cryptic answer.\n\n40 and 35 answers are similar, because in both, the number of boars increase by 6, which is 35, or by 5, which is 40.

The choices are A:restaurants, B: casserolets, C:root cellar, D: pockets, and E: pantry.\n\n### Input A:Floral Company\nI am in charge of picking all the flowers.  I have 120 peonies which are $4 each, 56 roses which are $2 each, and 104 daisies which are $1 each.  If I buy 68 roses, how many daisies should I pick?\n#### Rationale:The answer is that she would pick around 100 daisies.\n\n### Rationale:\nIn this situation she is in charge of buying all the flowers so to answer this you need to understand the prices and amounts of flowers they have to buy to be close to 100 daises.  From the information provided in the question it appears that she should buy around 68 roses which leaves 69 daisies to buy in order to get close to 104 daises.\n\n\n### Input B:\nThe company I work for had $32,000 worth of inventory last year and $37,000 worth this year.  How much was the increase in inventory value?\n#### Rationale:$32,00 is worth of inventory last and $37, 000 is worth of invenoty this year.  The increase in the worth is $ 5,000\n\n\n### Rational:\nThis question is asking to identify the increase in value of inventory.  The question provide the amount of inventory last year $32,07 so if you take 32,00 and minus 32,07 you will get 5,00 as the increase in value of the inventory this year.  The question did not ask how much less it was so you need to solve the problem by subtracting last year worth from this year worth.\n\n###Input C:\nAnthony is taking a class of 17 students.

If a sample of 2 marbles is taken from the bag with the blue marbles, the remaining marbles are 8 blue, how many marbles were originally in the bag?\n\n### Difficulty level: 3\n\n### Demorstration:\n\n* Take one bag and shuffle both green and yellow together. Do not mix with any other colors \n* Then, without looking at the marbles, distribute the marbles into the other two bags. \n* Remove 2 marbles from the \"blue\" bag.\n* Multiply the number of green marbles you have with the sum of the remaining marbles in the \"green\" bag, and in the \"yellow\" bag. \n* The result should be 1 less.  The difference between that number and 8 is the number of original blue marbles.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n* Because we know how many marbles are in the bags, we can assume that the remaining marbles in each bag will add up to the sum of the marbles in the bags. \n\nFor example:\n\n```\nGreen has 4 + 6 marbles\n```\n\nAfter we take the total of how many blue marbles are left and subtract that by 1, that is equal to how many green marbles were remaining in the bag. \n\n### Input Output #7: \n\nThis Input Output was challenging.

Hence, we can say that Jamie's daddys age = month before his birthday + 1 and Jamie is 1 month younger than his dad as given in the question, so the correct option is b that Jamies dad is twenty-four years old and Jamie is 2 months ago from his dads age.\n\n### In this task, we were asked to find the option correct, so in order to find that option we need to observe the problem closely and write down the necessary things and then come to conclusions that the statement can be formed by only one option.\n\n### As given in the question, Jamies dads birthday was in a month before the birthday on November 4, so we can say that Jamies dad was 24 years old at least 2 months before the birthday on 4th November. If we substitute this in the given question we will get Jamies dad is either 24 years old or 25 years because 36 years < 4 * 11 = 44 years and 24 years +36 years of age = 60 years which is the total no. of years in 2 years.

{"text": "Choice: B\n\n### Rationale:There is no one correct answer for this prompt. Choice of A is incorrect because the word \"illiterate\" has a completely different meaning than what the prompt describes. Choice of C is incorrect because most people aren't able to own their own home, so not meeting expectations is irrelevant. Choice of E is incorrect because having enough food is a matter of \"enough\", and as long as they have enough food, they would be considered educated. Choice of D is incorrect because it isn't a measurement of education, but instead only means that that they have enough food.\n\n### Input How many times does \"in\" appear in each of the following words? Choices: 1: in the middle 2: at the end of the word 3: beginning of the word 4: before the vowel\n\n### Response How many times does \"In\" appear in each of these words? Choices: A: one  B: five  C: four D: none E: two\n\n### Rational:\nThe correct answer is choice B. We should not give up on this question after just looking at choice A, and choice D is wrong because we can clearly see 'In' in the word 'Information,' and 'Important.' The answer is most likely not two, four, or five because the question says that it is before the vowel, and an answer with 'before vowel' is incorrect. \n\nYou should also be aware of when a question is giving you an answer choice that is too obvious. In this case, when the question tells you it should be before a vowel, the answer will be \"before a vowel\" it is the simplest form of answering a question, but it would be considered a \"wrong\" answer. In this case, this question would be better formatted like \"How many times does \"In' appear before the vowel?\" This may seem insignificant, but in tests like the SSAT, it counts as 10%.\n\n### Input What does this phrase mean?\nFix it so he can't use the loophole.\n\n### Response The phrase means: find a solution and apply it to a problem that is not able.\n\n### Rationle:\nThe answer is clearly \"Apply the solution to the loophole.\" This is not the same as \"", "answer": "B: knowledgable"}

The judge had a board with the options A - 100%, B - 10%, C - 20%, D - 90%, and E - 110%. The judge put together the punishment by taking the A, B, C, D and E points and making a new sentence.

The given statement states that the car can be filled 55 gallons, but we do not know how many gallons it will consume. Let's say the car consumes 20 gallons \n\n55 - 20 = 35 gallons\nTherefore, the car will consume 35 gallons when it is full.\n\n### Why was the gas tank of the car full?\nAns:The statements say he has a full tank at 7:30 am, at 11:45 am, at 2:00pm, and at 4:40 pm.\n\nFull Tank = 7:30, 11:40 + 2:00 + 4:40\n\nLet's say the car consumed 15 gallons\n\n15/54 * 55/12 = 40%\n\n### What is Peter's average speed?\nAns.

{"text": "Kitchen cupboard\n\nKitchen cupboard: 530937281040831423\n\n### Demystification:\n\nThe answer is kitchen cupboard.\n\nLet's look at a sample question now.\n\nIn the room where I'm writing this are 10 candles and 7 matches. How many matches does it take to burn through each of the candles in that room?\n\nWhenever I put a number in front of a \"how much\" question, I always want that number to be divisible by 10. And the only divisible-by-10-number that has the same digit in the ones place as the ones place of the question is 7. So a seven match candle is the key to all answers here.\n\nIt would have been a little easier to figure out if one of the choices was 7 matches. But it's actually easier to figure out if all the choices are less than 7. For this question, that's four matches, so I'm looking at questions with four matches or less. The other choice that has seven matches is kitchen cupboard. So I'm left with chicken, pantry, and maryland.\n\nWe can start off with kitchen cupboard. Since it's one less than seven, I subtract one from both sides, and the answer becomes 2. But I remember from my discussion of multiplication and division that I can get both division and multiplication by doing the opposite. So I can do 2:7 is 1 and get 36. And if we take 1/3 of 36, we get six. Since I don't believe I was given seven, we know that the answer is not kitchen cupboard.\nAfter the kitchen cupboard answer is removed as a possibility, we are left with two choices. \nWe can make all numbers that end with 3 divisible by 3 using (3\u00d73)(3+1)= 10(7). So we can look at 7 matches as 10.\nWe can look at all numbers with a 0 or a 1 in the ones place, and we know that 7 matches ends in zero. And now we can find that 0 matches up with zero matches to get our answer of zero. So we can remove both chicken and pantry as possibilities", "answer": "C: chicken"}

Which time will have fewer people?  Choices: A: both B: gym C: spa  D: none of them \n \n### Response: Since both locations are only open for an hour, it is a tie.\n\n### Example:\nA farmer is looking for the best price for a horse. He sees two people selling horses, but each only sells the animal to those who beat them.  He wants to know who is willing to pay most, so he asks: \"Which of you will give me the most money if I beat them in a race?\"  The first person to answer will give a price.  Who will give the most money?\n\n### Instructions: Answer the question below.\n\n### Choices: 1. I will make a larger bet because they will not be able to race again in case of an even result, so they will have to pay a lot more to take me on to another race. 2. I will make a smaller bet because they will not want to have me back in for any more races. My chances of winning are just as good or even better.\n \n### The correct answer is:\nBoth the correct and incorrect answers will give the maximum amount the seller is willing to lose. The horses will not race again, and since there is an even chance either could win, the seller will lose their horse if you win, and it will never return.\n\n### The owner does not care about the odds of the race, he only cares about getting the highest price.\n\n### Response I would bid higher and keep on increasing my bid by 30 bucks each time to get the highest bid. The man is betting I will not be able to beat him and he is right.

B: It looks like the older license plates had a small number which was located in the left-hand corner at the bottom. C: No, that was before my age.\n### Output: Choices: A(yet again): The license number is two digits long, so your age can be 6 years or 6 months older. It doesn\u2019t help to have more than six decades to choose from. The older you get, it makes no difference how many decades you have, just that you get older. But, the more decades in your age, the less likely the number on the license is to be six times your age. Also, when you are younger, a smaller number would be less likely, but as you age, the number becomes higher. B: If the license number is greater than 8,200, you can rule out the 400 series license plates. If it is less than 5,500, you can eliminate the 900 series. If the number is between 5,501 and 8,201, you can\u2019t rule out the numbers since they contain only two digits. C: It would depend on exactly when the person passed the driving exam.

The whole travel time is eight minutes.

{"text": "Let\u2019s take a look at C\n\n### Reference:\nRosenbloom, Josh; Bhatia, Shantanu (2016-01-12). \"Chapter 1: Getting started with Excel\". Introductory Microsoft Excel, 9781119028132. Prentice Hall: Pearson.\n\n### Rationale / Detailed Solution:\nExcel has a very neat feature called data tables, which you can use to automatically fill your spreadsheet with the information you want.  Data tables come in two flavors: data validation rules and calculation rules.  The instructions show that this is a calculation rule.  \n\nIn case you are wondering where to find data tables (data validation, data calculation) you can create these by going to the Data tab, then the Data Tools group, then click once on the small triangle at the top of the screen, then scroll down to the table option.\nYou should see the \"Validation\" section to the left and \"All\" in the bottom right.  The only option you don't want is \"validation list\". You click it, then \"Add to Data\".  Selecting a list from the drop down will auto populate both columns if it is a list.  It will auto populate the row with a calculated number if it is a calculation.  Select \"Calculation\" and you will see the following options.\n\nI like this for a couple of reasons. First, it is a way to automate the whole thing and it also gives you the ability to see how this calculation is done in real time.  I find this very useful. I don\u2019t often have to go back and check a formula because I want to know what it is doing at the click of a single button.\n\nI know not everyone wants to calculate in this way. Some people prefer to not know. That's alright.  The choice is yours.  This is just a way to do something a little different and still find value.\n\nI know that in order to provide a detailed solution I probably need to address the formula as well, but I don\u2019t understand how this question is considered a \u201ctactical task\u201d.\n\nThis is a bit of a gray area in my book as to whether there is an assumption about having a 40 inch TV.  It\u2019s not clearly defined.  I have", "answer": "B: names"}

Article III, which is considered the top tier in the federal court system, district courts are federal trial courts. Article IV district courts are trial courts that are situated in each state. And the last tier is the district courts that make up the territory belonging to the United States. This article will exclusively address the issue of the district courts that are governed by Article III of the United States Constitution and are considered federal courts.\n\nDue to their status as the top tier in the United States federal court system, Article III federal district courts have distinct procedures that distinguish them from Article IV federal district courts. However, there are situations whereby the jurisdictions of Article III federal districts and Article IV federal district courts overlap, such as in bankruptcy matters, as in reorganization proceedings and proceedings involving the bankruptcy of a federal corporation. In instances like these, the federal district courts have complete jurisdiction.\n\nQuestion 14\nThe 56 judges on the United States' District Courts are elected through the process of appointment.

If you are 5 feet tall, what is the average height in the line-up?\n\n### Response :\n\nThe average height is, obviously, not 5 feet because the average of the 10 is the length to the root 10, which is 5.5\nSo,\n5.5*(5.5)^10/10 -> round to the nearest cent ->  1279/100cm\n\n### How long will each round take?\n\n#### Round 1\n\nYou will eat a piece of meat smaller than the meat you will be given the next round, therefore you must eat half as much as the last round\n\nYou are given a piece of meat for each round and will not be given any the first time you go in.

{"text": "C\n\n### Reason\nThe response is correct. The prompt describes a situation where people are expecting a funeral to be solemn and serious since they expected the situation where Shane was supposed to speak to cheer them up. The first reason that we can see is the boldfaced portion of this response. The boldfaced portion of the response states that the people expected the situation where Shante was supposed to speak to \"cheer them up\". This is a reference to the fact that the event being described in the prompt is Shante's father's funeral. Because the funeral was occurring, people expected the funeral to contain solemn cues. The boldfaced part of the response tells us that people expected the event to be serious and serious is synonymous to solemn.\n\n### Input Output Explanation\nShane has 16 friends, and each of them brings a treat. They then each take half of what each other person contributed. Shane is left with 144 cookies and 72 brownies. Therefore, in total, there are 216 snacks.\n\n### Task:\n\n### Inputs:\n\n```python\ninput1 = \"Maria is older than Jack.

I am writing to you right now after I watched your latest video on preparing healthy food, I was actually impressed by what you did and how you were prepared for the food, so I am thinking of doing what you have done, just to make my life easier, but I still haven't got a good answer about what kitchen tool to use, that's why I am turning to you today. A few weeks ago I had a cooking class and my trainer was using a different type of food can opener, so for me I can use it right now. I will not even complain about how fast it opened my can of food because I don't know what can opener is that, it's only that for me it's hard to learn how to use that because I was always used to the old can opener I used before. After I tried that for a day I stopped using it and started to look for a new one, right after that when you were doing your video you were using that food can opener, and I was like wow! that's it, that's the one, but after I saw it I was like \"Why the Hell is it so hard to use?\" I will like to know what would be the benefits of using that food can op, and which one should I recommend in buying, it would take me more than a week to have this thing prepared with everything. I hope to get an answer from you so it can help me prepare my meal faster than ever. Thank you for you time and I hope I'll hear from you soon.

There is no cat that just has one day vintage look so that's 3 * caturday = 3 * 85 =255\nThere is no cat that just is cathousey so that's 6 * cathousey = 6 * 85 = 490 cathousey'ies.\nTo find how many more dogs have vintage look cathousey'ie's then the two cat count the vintage look flathie'ie so we use 255 =350.\n\nThus the total dogs that have the vintage thingy = 350+490 = 840\n\n1 * this = 840/1 = 840 dogs with the vintagethingy but 2 * that the cathousey count = 1240 dogs but the cathousey only count in feline so it's 490/3 =207.5\nThe 350 * this =  350 + 207.5 = 557.5 cathousey dogs\nThe answer is dogs = 557 dogs.", "answer": "C: bible"}

{"text": "play piano\n\n### Demostration:\n\nWhen I was little I had a great job. I worked at a local bakery, and I used a machine called a meat slicer. A meat slicer makes it safe and easy to cut meats like, steaks, chiken and beef. Before there was a slicer people who made, and sold steaks and other meat had to use a sharp razor blade. It was much more dangerous. Even if you did slice the meat perfectly, after one use you had a piece of metal lodged in the cuts of meat. It was not very sanitary, and many butchers were injured, or killed each year.  My first day on the job the boss taught me how to use the meat slicer. He showed me where to put the meat, and even showed me, the first cuts that I was supposed to make. I made a few sliced as he talked. He told me, \"Every time you cut the saw blade you must make at least four cuts in the meat. You must be sure that your cuts go in opposite directions, or else the saw will bind. If the saw binds you will cut your finger off, or in the worst case scenario you can sever a tendon.\"\n\nThe first time they let me try on my own my machine wouldn't cut at first. I made cut in the direction I thought the saw blade was supposed to, and then made a cut going back another way. I did this four time, each time I felt a small slice from the saw and a slight bit of liquid from the meat coming from the cut.  The last time I did it, I felt my finger go numb, and I knew that things were bad. I turned it off, and called my boss over. He took a look and he said, \"This is not good. Where do your slices go?\" I looked where I was cutting, and saw the four slices of meat, but instead of the saw going in opposite direction to the meat it went with the cut of the meat. The slicer had twisted a little bit from where the last person had cut before me, and my blade wasn't going in right direction.\n\nThe next time I sliced it went much smoother, and was much safer because my cuts were going right.", "answer": "C: play piano"}

{"text": "D\n\n### Democratization and globalization have often been seen as two separate processes that had little to do with each other.  As we will see, however, they are in reality deeply intertwined.  We can say that the democratization process in a country inevitably will lead to globalization of that region. In turn, the globalization process will further the democratization of a region.  If a region is democratic the government is representative, the people exercise citizenship rights, and political power is not concentrated on a few individuals. If a country is not democratic, the government becomes authoritative or non-elective and the society is controlled by a few individuals  The more democratic a country is, the more open and transparent the country will be. And when a region is more open and transparent, the global economy cannot be resisted. In this way globalization is part and parcel of democratization. In other words, globalization is a natural progression for democratic countries.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe goal of the above question is to test the ability of the candidate to explain their position regarding an intricate issue. This kind of question is often used to evaluate analytical thinking along with critical thinking skills of an individual.\n\n### Difference:\nGlobalization is the process in which all the countries and their people begin to merge and co-ordinate into one.\n\nDemocratization is a process in which a government becomes representative of the people in the country and it is elected.\n\n#### References\nwww.hbsa.org (2012-06-03)http://www.hbsa", "answer": "C: city"}

How many crayons remain in the box after 25 weeks?\n\n### Response:\"235\"\n\n### Dem:You can get 235 by subtracting 3 from the original number: 100 - (.03 * 100) = 97. The original number, 100, is.03 times 306: 306*3/100 = 97.  \n\n## Output:1000\n\n>  How many more years past 25 did it take for the number of crayons to double?\n\n### Rational:Because we can get to (A) by subtracting.03, \"3 Years\" is too large.

There were more students who answered the questions than those who presented their answers on the spot.\n\nIn the end, all the students who weren't part of the presentation were assigned to form groups to watch the presentations. How many students watched the presentations?\n\n### Choice:\n\n<ol>\n<li>20</li>\n<li>30</li>\n</ol>\n\n### Answer:\n\nThe answer is 2. Choice A is incorrect because according to the problem, 20% of the students have answered the questions and 50% of those answered are not a part of the presentation. Therefore, 20% * 0.5 - 20% *0.5 / 100 = 0.5 *0.5.\n\nNote: The above answer has two 0.5's, which is incorrect. The actual answer is 0.25. Let's say x = 0.25, now the final answer y = (0.5*0.5)/100.

{"text": "E\n\n### Instructions:Read the following passage, and answer the question below.\n\nA good sales person has certain skills such as good customer service, being knowledgeable, and understanding of products. The ability to communicate and understand the needs of others comes with the territory. It is critical to listen to the client, understand its needs, and then to provide the proper tools to accomplish that mission. One problem many sales people run into is lack of understanding of the tools they are selling and it appears to the customer as though the sales person simply doesn\u2019t care. As a result, many sales people are unsuccessful not because they don\u2019t have solid sales skills, but because they don\u2019t take initiative to provide proper after sales service and training. It comes down to commitment. If a sales associate isn't 100 percent committed, they shouldn't be in sales.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the main idea of the passage?\n\n### Detailed answer:\nThe passage is an advertisement that talks about the traits a salesperson (sales associate) needs to be successful.  It lists traits such as good service, knowledge of products, and the ability to communicate.  The author then goes on to say that sometimes sales people do not succeed, not because of lack of skill, but because of lack of commitment.  The author suggests that sales associates should be 100% committed if they want to succeed in their job.\n\n### Input\n\nSales people generally spend a long time training and learning all they can about the products they sell.\n\n### Response\n\n### Solution:\nWhat is the most likely problem with the products a sales associate is selling?\n\n### Solution Detailed Answer:\nSales associates that are not committed will not take initiative to provide adequate after sales service and training for the products they are selling, thereby ensuring customer dissatisfaction. Inadequate training by a sales associate can result in a great deal of confusion to a customer, and likely a return and/or another purchase, for the buyer. Ultimately, this will result in a very dissatisfied customer that, without proper service, is likely to stop buying your products, and your profit will take a nosedive.\n\n### Deducing: Read the following instructions below and respond in your", "answer": "A: slender"}

{"text": "D\n\n## Solution\n\nTo solve the multiple choice question, it is necessary to understand the structure of the questions, namely, the way in which the answers are constructed and the fact that a question in the multiple choice format that asks for a percentage is usually about fractions. \n\nThe first question says \"Demonstration: Input: If the number of Dobernan puppies is 88, how many more Schnauzers?\" The answer should be 36 because 88 is halfway between 144, which is twice as many as 72, which is 5 less than twice 18, which is 5 more than a third of 86 (because 89 is 5 more than 84). \n\nThe second question asks \"Demonstration... if the remaining number...\" to explain how numbers can be divided into equal parts, which can be expressed as multiples of a small factor.\n\nThe third question is about how \"The marching band has 260 members\" could be expressed in terms of multiples of 4, which may be more easily solved without trying to find a way to convert an expression in terms of fractions.\n\nThe fourth question, which was \"Demonstration\" instead of \"Instruction\" is solved the same way as the third question.\n\nThe fifth question has a trick answer, not in terms of multiples: the answer is four because the words \"told his boyfriend to pick up\" indicate that one way to solve it is to take four away.\n\nThe sixth question is a trick solution. The answer is only 2, not 4, because the way that it was put (using \"three times x\") suggests that there are three choices for one item and six choices for the other.\n\nThe only question that requires converting fractions to decimals is the first in the last group. The second in that group deals with simple division, which can be done if the number of boys is less than half the number of girls who do not like to play basketball.", "answer": "C: small group"}

Data processing\n3. 3. Data Modeling\nThe so-called data processing steps include the following six major steps:\n1. 4. data cleaning\n2. Data transformation and storage.\n3. Transform data into knowledge. 5. 6. Build models based on data. \n\n1. Data preparation is the most important part of data processing of machine learning models.\n\nAfter data cleaning, data needs to be stored and processed in different data formats to enable users to process data in data science or AI. These formats include text formats (eg Excel), image formats (eg JPG), video formats (eg AVI), sound formats (eg MP3)... The most common data format is CSV (C-style file), which is readable by most computers and is used to save data in the cloud.\n\nThe transformation of data includes three processes: transforming data into a higher-level data type, combining different attributes of data into a new attribute according to the rules provided by data scientists, and converting different types of data into a unified standard; the main purpose is to make data more consistent and suitable for subsequent processing. After data transformation, the data needs to be stored in different data formats according to the data storage methods provided by data scientists and technicians. Users can store data using relational models (tables, fields, cells, rows etc.).\n\nThe storage of data is to save data information in a database. The database records and stores data according to the model defined by data scientists. It is the foundation of data mining and data analysis. When the database receives some data, it will automatically generate some summary statistics information according to the model given by data scientists. To make the data more efficient, data storage can be used to combine related data.\n\nData Science, which combines machine learning models with big data processing tools, is being used in more and more scenarios to convert data into knowledge.

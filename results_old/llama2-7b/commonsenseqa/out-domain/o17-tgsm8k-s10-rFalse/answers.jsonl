The books are bought for $900 and the other $531 is due the next month.\n\n### Input Incorrect answer\nWhat is currently 1451 cents and by 23? If each book has a higher cost than the previous book, the total cost will increase when buying more books. \n\nYou were so close!  Did you use the correct formula for how much money it costs to buy n number of things? The formula is: total = unit price * n, so n will remain constant in this equation.

Since we start from the first number of apples, we need to find n-1 (so we do 1 row with no apples, 2 rows with 2 apples in them, etc.), and add to that the product of their height and length(which is the sum of the rows with apples in them).\n\n<img src=\"\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QXDlQlY.png\"", "answer": "A: pass water"}

For this, he bought 7 locks of the highest quality. The locks have the same quality, and each lock costs $3 to buy and $5 to maintain in good quality each month. If he saves 20% of the price of each lock, how much money is he saving if he maintains all locks?\n\n### Response\n\n$174\n\n### Input - Solution\n\nJohnny buys 7 locks. They cost $21, but he saves 20%, so they only cost $17 each. He spends $17 each month on maintenance, so he spends $119 on locks each month.\n\nHis goal is to save 20%, or $21, each month. So at the end of the month, he'll have 80% (1-0.20) of his money left over. This ends up being $87 each month.\n\nThe amount of money he has left over each month is the amount he's saving.

At 4:30, he can walk 1.25 miles per hour. \n### Dem:Find what time he should leave the bank. \n\n### Response\nThe bank is 200 meters from his house, so the distance he needs to cover will be 0.81 miles (which he can do at the rate of 1.25 m/h). This will take 0.64 hours or 6400 seconds. The bank closes at 5:00, so he can leave at around 5:16 or a little before that.\n\n### Input : There were 1024 sheep in Mary's farm.  Including 1/2 sheep died, 1/3 got sick and 1/4 escaped, how many were still left?\n### Dem:\nThe remaining sheep = 1024 - [1/3 sheep escaped X 1/3 sheep died + 1/2 sheep got sick]. Solving for the remaining sheep, we get: \n\n1/3 sheep escaped * 1/3 sheep got sick + 1/2 Sheep got sick:\n\n1/9 sheep escaped + 1/18 sheep got sick: 0.0111... sheep escaped + 0.0556... sheep got sick.\n\n11 / 29 + 4 / 16 = 23 / 45, which is about.513 = 0.5.

{"text": "E\n\n### Instructions:A new toy company is launching a robotic toy that you can command and control from your smartphone. Write the function that will determine the total sum of the toys that were sold during a month if you pay 15% more during a weekend sale. Hint: if you buy 4 toys paying $10 each, you would spend $40. Also, if you buy 3 more toys during that weekend sale in the same month, you would spend $18.\n\n### Solution:If somebody likes the temperature cool, they might have many more than one electric fan. If somebody likes the temperature hot, they might just use the air conditioner. It is very reasonable that a person with one electronic fan is only a kid. \n\nA new toy company wants to see what type of robotic toy one can control from a smartphone. You control the robotic toy by a remote control or a smartphone from afar. \n\nThe new toy company wants a function which can help them figure out the toys they sold last month with its total amount.\n\nThere is a promotion where during a weekend sale they pay 15% less, but otherwise they pay 10% less. \n\nGiven the function which can calculate if paying less than the normal price, the goal is to get a function which can figure out the total amount of toys sold in a month. \n\nLet's first get the minimum amount of toys sold per month and then subtract the promotion's price.\n\nIn total, 10% is the amount per month which was not paid, but they now pay 15%.\n\nThus, it is reasonable to subtract 15% of the total amount from the 10%.\n\nThe main idea is to have a function that figures out the total sum of the amount per month.\n\nThe only question is: can you figure out what the function should look like by yourself without the help or directions?\n\n### Solution\n\nFirst, it is important to note that we can only decrease the price by 15% (for the weekend sale). It goes from 10% to 15%.\nThe total amount is thus equal to 100, or 1500.\n\nSecond,", "answer": "A: home"}

Your task is to write a response based on your analysis of this text. \n\nAfrican people suffered a lot of injustice and racial inequality that were brought about by the European whites that came in the 17th century. In this case, European white men who came from the northern regions wanted to have a lot of freedom like those African people. As a result, they set aside their territories of settlement and started going to the African people, settling near their area. This action made these white people to dislike each other. Their dislike became worse in the 19th century when the African people started to own lands that belonged to the white people, who were settling in America. It was during 19th century that African enslavement of white people became a very serious issue. \n\n### Writing Rationale:\nIssues of justice and equality, as well as how to deal with them, have been the most challenging topic to address. Most of these issues relate to freedom and equality. Some states have made attempts to solve issues of injustice and inequality through various approaches. In this case, the best way to solve social injustice is through awareness and education. One can learn more about the problems and how to deal with them from being well informed about them or from reading books written by different authors about the same topic. \n\n## Question:The following text is a sample essay, your task is to write a related essay based on your knowledge and understanding of the information presented.\n\n### Text : The number of apples in a bag is two times as many oranges in Tom\u2019s basket.

That failure was a catalyst in my growth as an entrepreneur though. If I weren't able to get that experience out of my business, things may have never progressed the way they did.\n\n### Explanation:\nI started a business about 15 years ago. I grew up helping my father manage his small business, so I thought starting a business of my own would be fairly easy. I began renting space in retail locations, and I started selling my product. I became complacent with my sales, and I got too confident that my business would continue to grow. I failed to keep my attention on the details that made up my business, and I missed several opportunities to expand.\n\nWithin the first ten months my entire warehouse closed and I was forced to move operations to a new location. I moved into a brand-new building with the idea of expanding my business, and my second biggest failure happened. I failed to hire a good enough staff to expand into the online retail space. As a result, my online sales weren't as good as they needed to be to help pay for the new building. In only two years, the business lost about $50,000 in profits. The building was over 25,000 square feet.\n\nAlthough my business ultimately failed and I left the retail market behind, I learned a lot from the experience. I began to take notes and research other small businesses. I learned to read the details in every aspect of a business. My attention to detail expanded into other areas of my life as well. If I weren\u2019t able to let that business go, I might not have ever been able to get an advanced degree in business and technology.

You don't feel safe walking alone after dark, as crime levels have been rising.  Your phone just went off and you are told that an earthquake is going to hit your town at the exact time that you were going to walk home.  On the way to your friend's house, you've been struck by lightening.  Now, the police pull you over to give you a warning about driving.  What are the chances that something bad would happen to you leaving the house at 2am? The time is between 10 pm and 4 am.\n\n### Response\nThis is 2am and lightening is going to strike in between 2 and 4 for earthquakes.\nThere is a 1 in 500 chance  of being struck by lightening anytime in a day.\nSo there is 1 in 400,000 times a 24 hours\nBut there is also a 2 am chance of crime increasing in your area.\nBecause the first lightning strike might not occur you should factor that in as well when calculating for the probability of crime rates increasing.\nThe first 2 am you have a 70% chance of getting assaulted because that is also the 1st lightning time. The second 2 am your chance increases to 10% with a 1 in 4 chance. In the third time, the probability increases to 25%, with a 1 in two chance to get mugged. The fourth time increases to 50% of possibility that you are going to be mugged or assaulted.\nBut by now there is a 1 in two for the last lightning to happen at 4 am. So there is a 50 % chance for you to get assaulted and mugged from someone not knowing that there are police in the area.\nThe lightening is always going to happen regardless of the probability of it and your probability of being safe.\n\n### [Reference](https://learn.co/lessons/how-to-calculate", "answer": "B: polished"}

{"text": "I'm pretty sure C is correct\n### Demonstraion:\nIf you need a notebook, you can go to a notebook store.  You can also find one in a bookstore or a desktop.  In an office setting, you might not find one, but in a library, you might find one.  I find notebooks are used by both children and adults for note-taking and book-lovers.  I usually use my notebook because I like to write.  Notebooks are great for writing since they come in many colors and types.  They have sturdy and smooth bindings and lined pages which can be easily alterable.  Notebooks have many practical uses, especially for people who write or draw.  For one, they're compact and made of sturdy paper.  Second, their bindings provide a sturdy surface to write or draw on.  You don't have to worry about pages falling out since you don't need to clip your used pages.  In addition, they're made of paper which is smudge-resistant (meaning it's hard to smudge the ink), which makes it easier for you to take notes. Moreover, notebooks come in various colors and types so there's something for everyone.  These days, notebooks come with a wire-spiral binding which is sturdy and very convenient if you want to make notes in an organic manner.  People often use notebooks when they want to write or take notes.  They're very convenient that you can carry anywhere with you.  In an office or a classroom, people often keep a few notebooks on their desks to take notes.  Schools and offices often provide them, too, so you'll be given to each person you work with so you can keep notes.  When you're traveling, it's also convenient to take notes.  In short, notebooks have many practical applications.  They're versatile in their usage and practicality which is why I believe it should be in the response.", "answer": "A: bookstore"}

Demonstration input Inputs: The number of goals of Barca scored against them last season is 83% of the total goals scored in the last season. If the players scored same number of goals. How many goals did they score?\nOutput: 54870\n\nExplanation:\nSuppose there were n goals scored, and there were m players.\nThen 83% of 83% of n would be equal to 5487.0\n\nSo this is a question of rounding\n\n5487 -> 5500\n\nSo for there are 34500 goals scored.\nYou can see the equation to get this answer is 83%= 5500/5000, so 83% = 1.1 and 1.1 rounded to 1 is 5487\n\nSo m > 3450 and 3450 > n, which means the two players scored the most goals, and in order to get 5487, 3.45 times is what is needed for a total of m goal\nIt takes 245 days for 3.45 people to score as many goals as 1, and this is why it takes 6 days", "answer": "B: table"}

Choices: A: tired B: determined C: relaxed D: anxious E: focused\n\n### Response 2:A\n\n### Task\n\nIn the original programming question, if the amount of coins a player has left is less than or equal to the amount of coins needed to buy a prize, the question asks for an if statement that would return **FALSE**. Create a logical statement to check if the amount of coinst they have left is less than, or equal to, the amount of coins you need to buy the prize. Write a logical statement that will evaluate to **TRUE** when one of the events are true.\n\n### Input\n\nInput: A player has 87 coins. He/she must get the first player to go out, or the prize will not be awarded. How many coins does the player have to have left to win the prize?\n\n### Output\n\nOutput: False\n\n### Solution\n\nThe statement is: The player does not have two coins extra to get a first player to go out.\n\n### Demo:\nInput: 87 Coins\n\nInput: Not enough coins to pay for prize\n\n### Discussion:\n\nThis means that if the player has 100 or 98 coins, then he/she can get a first player to get out, so the output should be TRUE.\n\n### Sample Answer\n\nIf (the value of current number of coins - value of amount of coins to get the 1st player to go out) <= 0\nthen return FALSE or 0.", "answer": "A: pressure"}

{"text": "The answer would be B\n\n### Input:(100 points) In a large survey, 60% of respondents preferred the green color, whereas 25% preferred the blue color and 15% preferred the red color. What percent of respondents preferred one of the three colors?\n\n### Response:(200 points) This question requires you to determine the percent of the respondent who was \"stuck in the middle\". To do this you need to subtract the percent preferred by the respondent from 100%. Then divide this by 2 because you are dealing with 3 colors. 60-25 = 35; 35/2 = 17.5; 17.5% of the person was \"stuck in middle\". You have to find the number of responses who chose none.\n\n### (100 points)\n\n### InputThe total mile per hour speed of three vehicles is 95. One vehicle went 32 miles per hour. One vehicle went 40 miles per hour. The other one went 70 miles per hour. How far did each car drive?\n\n### (200 points)\nThe total mile per hour travel of the two non-100 miles per hour going vehicles is (x \u2013 32) + (x \u2013 40) is 72 miles per hour. Therefore the 70 miles per 60 minutes is the total distance. Therefore each vehicle has a 1.25 multiplier and 32/1.25 is the total distance of the 32 miles per 60 going. As such 32/125.\n\n### InputWhich is greater, 10 hours or 30 minutes?\n\n### InputHow many years were there between 1950 and 1980 inclusive?\n\n### Instructions:How many months are there between 1998 and 2007 inclusive?\n\n```\n5 months\n```\n\n### Response(200 points)In the statement above, the \"x-axis\" is years and the \"y-axis\" is the number of months. When you are given time you can assume (if you read carefully and no time is given a year) \"x-axis\" time units", "answer": "B: good karma"}

Other is a noun and other countries is an adjective so the other cannot be an adverb modifying see.  We are given that John joined the army so we can cross out choice A, B, and C.  The phrase see the world contains the noun phrase world and in order for it to remain a NP in English grammar the prepositional phrase other countries must be removed.  This means that we must cross out choice E as well since it contains both see and the world.  The remaining choice is the only choice that has both see and other and doesn't contain the world or other countries.\nChoice D is the only choice that is a preposition, linking words like preposition are usually adverbial in nature and in some cases like the subject of an adverbial phrase\n\n#### \nAnswer:\n\n# Example_solution_1\n### Input:It was time for Kelly to her carrots she had planted in 3 beds.  Carrots weighed lb.  she found pulled out pound 6 carrots\n\n### Rationales:78+178+209=363, 379-363=13.  13*6=88. \n\n### Answer:\n\n**Explanation**\n```\nThe correct answer is $88$.

One host is double the size of the other. \nIn order to divide the cake fairly, how could the smaller host's third serve as the total third for both?\n\n### Response\nAsked of A and B, each to take a third, the smaller host has to get his third before B gets his. The cake has a value of $10 more than what will be needed for A and B to get their thirds. This is to be given to host D. Hence, D's third would be what B's would be. D's third is thus $20, and that is host D's cut.\n\n### Answering The Math Question In The Instruction\n\n### Demostration\nB has a choice of having an amount that is either $20 or $25.  So, the problem becomes:  How can we divide B's choice into two amounts so that we can answer the question correctly?\n\nB can choose one of 2 values, $20 or $30.  The amount to be divided equally by A and B would be $35.  So, host B needs $15 for his third.  $35 - $15 = <<35-15=20>>220, so host B's third is $20.  Cut one way is $40 for A and $20 for B.

To solve this problem, a logical path of reasoning should be taken to determine the answer. Since the problem states that the turkey needs to be kept from spoilage, one should look for an answer that is most likely to help in that cause. This is most likely done by using an appliance in the kitchen, rather than a large building appliance. In order to determine which appliance would take care of the turkey, one must ask \"WHAT?\" The turkey is considered a live animal, and so it is safe to assume that it must be fed food. With this assumption, the question becomes \"WHO?\" is responsible for feeding it. That person would be the one who cooks, or that person's friends and family.

The cellular level is where most chemical reactions occur to generate energy, so it\u2019s highly likely that energy is released in the muscles more than most other organs or systems.\n\n### Exercise #2: Which statement is correct? Choices: A: Exercise releases energy in muscles and joints as a chemical reaction. B: Muscles are responsible for the majority of the body\u2019s energy needs.\nC: Exercise increases the body\u2019s energy efficiency.  If you exercise D: Exercise causes energy release.\nAnswer: D: Exercise, specifically physical activity, causes an increase in the body\u2019s energy release. \n\n### Rational #2: Muscles and joints are involved in physical activity, mainly because body movements are required during exercise. \nExercise is designed to increase an individual\u2019s level of activity and strength in their muscles and therefore physical activity will inevitably require an increase in the energy consumption in muscles and joint.\n\n### The body\u2019s primary energy source is glucose and physical activity increases the body\u2019s metabolism or the processes that convert nutrients and use oxygen.

{"text": "Winning\n\n### Rationale: Countering\n\n### Demofication\n\n### Correct\n\n### Wrong\n\n#### Answer: Winning E: dealing\n\nInput: In the year 2012, there is increasing evidence that the Sun will soon enter a period of intense magnetic activity, known as Solar Maximum, possibly within the next 5 years. It is important for scientists to prepare for the changes that will occur during this event, especially for NASA spacecraft currently in various orbits around the sun. These spacecraft use solar power to keep their instruments running, and solar activity can reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches Earth, making orbital batteries drain faster and increasing the likelihood that the spacecraft may lose power and drift off course. Solar Maximum is thought to occur every 11 years on average, with the latest Solar Maximum lasting from 2001-2002 and the next possible Maximum predicted by 2015.\nFor these scientists, the question at hand is how likely it will be to have any spacecraft drift off course by 2014?\nTo answer this question, it will be useful to estimate the number of spacecraft that will not have enough power to function after 2014. In order to do this, scientists can use a Poisson distribution, which describes random events that occur at a known average rate per unit of time. Poisson distribution is appropriate here since the expected number of events (drifting spacecraft) in 2014 can be estimated.\nGiven that there is increasing concern that the Solar Maximum may come sooner than predicted, we can assume that events (drifting space craft) will occur at increased rates during the next 2 years.  In order to estimate how many spacecraft will drift by 2013, let\u2019s assume that each spacecraft should drift by 2 years and 7 months after it stopped getting enough power to function.  That means that every spacecraft (in year 3) should drift once by the middle of the fourth year.  Using this estimate as an upper bound of events, we can use the Poisson distribution to find the probability a spacecraft will drift off course by the end of 2013.\n\nThe Poisson distribution, P, that describes the random", "answer": "C: count"}

It then pushes out warm air. Which of the following terms best describes this process? Choices:  b. evaporation A: convection B: conduction C evaporation D: convection\"\n\n### R:B\n\n### R:\"Convection does not involve an actual movement of the substance between the reservoir or source and the sink or area. In other words, convection does not involve the movement of a substance from a warm area to a cooler area through open space or a fluid, which is known as a gas. Instead, in convection, the warm areas, known as the source, exert a force on the substance, or the fluid or gas in this instance, so that the fluid ends up moving toward the cooler areas. This movement of the fluid or the gas away from the source, known as the sink or convection area, is the result of this force called buoyancy. Evaporation means, as the definition says, the transition of a liquid into a vapor. A substance evaporates when its temperature is high enough that the change state between liquid and vapor is possible. The substance can be water or another chemical. However, evaporation does not mean that evaporation does not involve a force, because any liquid has to be moved to its vapour state. This moving of the liquid can in turn involve a lot of heat, which could mean, for instance, that some of the water in the water tank evaporates if the water is warm enough\".\n\n### D\n\n### In math, is the following statement true?\n\n\\_\\_a\\) 0.05 x 2 = 0.10\\_\\_\n\n### B and C do not equal b, which one is right\n\n### Which of the following is a right angle?\n\n### Input:`The length of the side of a right triangle is 14.`\n\n### Output:`The length of the other side of the triangle is 12.`\n\n### Input:-10\n\n### Output", "answer": "C: superior"}

To check blood pressure with an ordinary doctor's sphygmomanometer requires at least 5 minutes and 40 seconds. To check blood pressure using a digital instrument requires only 15 seconds. Given this, the following problem can be answered with a simple equation.  \n\n### Demand:Choose one of the options below to fill in the blank. It costs the patients $10 to check their blood pressure, regardless of what type of instrument is used. Patients can only be checked, at any given time, by 2 doctors.  If the medical center has a choice of two instruments and the patients are to be checked equally by each, the medical center will choose to use which instrument, given the constraints and cost? (If there is no benefit to using the quicker instrument with 15 seconds, the medical center will keep using the 5 minute 40 second instrument.)\nThere is no benefit to using digital instrument. So doctor's sphyrgomomanometer will be used.\n\n### Rationales:\nDoctor's sphygmanometer should be used.\nSince patient can't take turns, it will cost $10.\nBoth the doctor can use digital and sphyrgmanometer to take blood pressure.\nIt will take 5 minutes and 54 seconds if each takes 5 minutes and 2 seconds, then it will take 5 minutes to take blood pressure of patients using digital instruments\n\n### Input 3:\nHow long does it take Sam to fill ink bottles?  58% of Sam's time is spent filling and capping bottles, so by how much does he have to cut his fill time to fill all 300 bottles in one day?

Also, there's a minimal chance of something going wrong when you are using cash. Cash can work in most places and can also be used without being traceable. It also allows you to plan your budget and also avoids you to overspend. Cash gives you greater freedom to shop without having to wait for funds to clear. Using cash makes shopping easier as you don't have to provide other kinds of payment.\n\n## Why ATM:\nUsing ATM is safe as your card and pin are not available for people to look at. It's also reliable as it is difficult to counterfeit. However, it is not as safe as it is prone to card skimming. Unlike using credit card, you cannot control how much money is in your account and a huge bill might appear shocking when you withdraw all the money from an ATM. ATM also requires a card and a user login.\n\n## Why Use Credit\nCredit allows customers to buy and pay later. If you don't carry enough money, credit allow you for purchases to be cleared later. For most of the businesses, credit is a crucial and indispensable facility. With credit, customers can take advantage of deferred payments. There are more convenient and efficient to use credit on a phone than on the internet.\n\n## Why Debit Card\nDebit card reduces your checking account balance by the amount you spent, so you are less likely to overspend. However, you can overspend if you have a credit limit overdrafts. Also, credit cards are used for fraudulent purchases, but with your debit card, your account is reduced", "answer": "B: city"}

Then, for each day of the week, he eats 9% of the remaining apples.  How many apples does he buy before the week is done?\n\n### Rationales:  We start with 3/8 of the apples the man needs.  So, he\u2019ll buy another (72/80) - 1 = 3/8ths.  Each day = (3/8) /7 =.125.  For the end of the week, multiply by 7, and then subtract that amount from 1.

If you have 0 knives, you will always fail to advance, but it will take two failures in-a-row, meaning that you can get off to a start. If you have 1 knife, you do not need to fail twice (1+1) in a row (1+1 = 2), meaning that you can make 2 trials. If you have 2 knives, you do not need 4 failures in a row (2+2), meaning you can make 3 trials (2+3), if you have 3 knives you can make 5 (3+1), if you have 4 knives you can make at least 7 (4+1, 4+1, 3+2, 2+3, 1+4).

I wasn\u2019t always a good student and I remember my parents taking me to tutoring. The tutor taught me things that made me feel smart. I wanted to do the same for other children when he I was old enough. I also wanted to make money by teaching math. I also wanted to be able to help children who struggle with this subject and to learn something in return.\n\n\n### 2.  In general, what approach do you think is the most effective in tutoring mathematics?\n\n\nThe tutoring method that I will use is the direct method, which is where I will start with the easy concepts and then go onto more difficult concepts. I want to make sure that the child understands when he or she starts working on more complicated concepts.\n\n\n## 3.  What math skills do you believe it would be necessary to master before tutoring?\n\n\n\nI believe that you must know math very well, which means you can\u2019t only know the answers to basic questions. You must know what type of question leads to each answer. You also must know the basic rules, such as which one comes first-order or operations and", "answer": "B: skill"}

{"text": "E\n\n### Instructor's Comments:\nFor the car rental question you made a common mistake of forgetting to remove the units (to convert from dollars to \ndollars and cents). When solving for a part that involves a unit, be sure to always remove the units, and vice versa. For example, after you have done the work for the first part of the problem, you can check to make sure you got the units right by substituting two values that you are given in the problem and see if you get the same answer for both units (to make sure the first part didn\u2019t cancel out anything).  It can help to make a line in the box where you will always write your units so that you don\u2019t forget to change them when doing the computations.  Remember that you can either make a unit to get the answer in the units in the problem, or you can use unit cancellation in the same way you solve problems of adding and subtracting integers, that is, by subtracting the units in the same way that you would for the parts. This can sometimes be helpful if, for example, the units of your answer would be easier to work with.\nFor the first hurricane question, the best answer was (E). It was clear that your computations were correct as long as you counted exactly how many times each person would have to drive.  Remember that you sometimes need to do a bit more work to check your computations!\nFor the next question, (A), note that if your computation was correct (it was in this case), once you multiply the two parts together, you\u2019ll never be off (as long as you computed the days correctly), so you\u2019re guaranteed that your answer will be correct no matter what computation you do! As long as you know the units you are computing in before the work, just computing one part and multiplying it to another part in the proper units is a very easy way to ensure your computations are correct.\nFor the last question, (D), a different type of error came in when doing your computations.  Make sure that you actually compute for each part the parts of the parts that you were given from the problem before combining them, and do things carefully so that you combine only like parts and combine the parts in the proper units.\n\n### Feedback:\n#### Review Problems for Class 12.R2.1\n####", "answer": "E: internet sites"}

In this way, it will take the least amount of time to reach the towns. <Rationale: Since the plane cannot fly in a straight line, it should fly around the north side of the two towns. In this way, the plane will spend the first half of the trip flying in a southward direction and the second half of the flight flying northward.\n\n### Response B: The plane should start in the south and fly northward in the first half of the journey. Then, it should fly over the towns, avoiding them on both sides. This strategy will minimize the overall time spent flying and will require less fuel. <Rationale: The plane can fly in a straight line to reach the towns. However, the plane cannot fly in this direction because it would be facing a headwind.

He knows that there are three aisles of eggs, and that each aisle has equal numbers of regular-priced eggs as well as two-for-one eggs.  Each egg in the two-for-one section is double the price that it is in the regular section.  It is assumed that this is the only place where he can get the two-for-the-price-of-one eggs.  The man says to himself, \u201cI only need to buy eggs.  I don\u2019t mind buying two-for-one if it costs double the price of one in the regular section\u201d.  For example, if we take the eggs in the regular section as E1 and the eggs in the two-for three section as E2, then E2-E1-=<<E2-E1-=-1>>-1 and this is double the price of one.  The grocery store is too tired to deal with all of the math, so instead of solving E1-E2=<<E1-E2=0>>0, instead they say, \u201cIf it costs exactly double the cost on eggs you need to pay for in the regular section, then it must cost twice the price of twice the price of one, which is four times the price of one.

{"text": "### Input Two-Hundred Twenty-five dollars are in a piggy bank.  If the owner withdraws 10% every other week, how much will be saved after 4 months?\n\n### Answer: 150 dollars (Rationalization:  There are two possibilities for what would be left.  One possibility is that two months worth or 50% would be left.  This is unlikely because the numbers do not match, but for this problem it would work because the percentage is 10%.  This leaves 200%.  If the percentage is 15%, which is less than 200%, then it is less likely that the piggy bank would be empty after two months.  However, what would be left is 62. It would be unlikely that the person would still have some money in the piggy bank after putting 50% in it.  It is more likely that two months worth or less would have been put in, but two months worth or more would be left.  So, the solution to this problem is that at the end of 4 months, after 30 withdrawals, 100$ would have been withdrawn, and of 225$ the 20% left over would be 45$, which leaves 180$ in the piggy back.  If there were only two possibilities, then there could have been a situation where there is only 25$ in the pig's bank after 33 withdrawals.  However, the other option is 75$ at the end of the fourth month after 50 withdrawals and 475$ left. If you assume that each withdrawal is 60 dollars with an empty piggy bank at the beginning of the problem, then there would be 29% left at the end.  So, 29% of 200$ is 57$ and 143$ would be left, which is more likely to be more than what is available.  In the real world 15% would be left after two months, but that is less likely.)\n\n\n### Input One-Hundred ten dollars were spent by purchasing two books for 22.5 and 50 each.

(r/g is the ratio and n is the number.)\n### Solution\n\nWe want to see how we find r/g without performing calculations. The simplest way to do this is to ask ourselves, how do we find g/r? We know that g/r is part of the ratio. So in this case, it does not make any sense that we do not know g/r and r/g at the same time. We cannot get from r to g and vice versa.\nR/G and G/R are inversely proportional to each other.  Let me explain further, if we have G/R=2/5, then r/g=5/2\n\n2/5 5/2\n\nTherefore, we know that r/g is inversely proportional to G/R. Since R and G are inversely proportional, then when one of the two increases, the other one decreases proportionately. When g increases, r decreases and vice versa. But to actually solve this question, we also need to solve for r to get the answer.\nThus, to answer this question, we just have to find the inverse of r/g to get g/r\n\nSince 5/7/15=(5)(7/15) and 2=(2/5)\n\n5/7/10=(5)(7/5)=35/7\n\nThus, the ratio of boys to Girls is 35/7", "answer": "B: look attractive"}

Answer:  4\n\n### Rationales: 4 ft x 4 ft = <<4 ft x 4 = 16>>16.  Since the diamonds cover the entire size, which is 48 in^2, the height = width = 24 inches.  The weight of 10lbs = 7,000lbs/0.7lb = 10,000lbfor the height and width, so the volume is 48/24*48/24 = <<48/24(48/24)=48/2/4>>48/4/4 = 12 inches.

(A) If you choose to use the membership once, it would cost you the entire membership fee of 72$ and would be 72$ total.\n\nChoices (B) are 276$ in 5 months.\n\nWe can simplify the process by taking 72/5 = <<72/5=14>>14 as the average, and divide the first cost of $72 into it.\n\nThis leaves 276-$14*5 = <<276-14*5=118>>118$.\n\nThis is, by default, more affordable, due to the reduced cost.  And, since the cost of membership is 72$ and you can choose to make it use only once, it\u2019s more cost efficient in the long run if you make use of it 5 times.\n\nBecause 5-1 = <<5-1=4>>4 times costs you a lot less than you would be billed.\n\nSo, the best option is b.\n\n$300*5=$1500.", "answer": "D: canada"}

It is very dangerous to mess up your carpet, bed, table, and walls while having breakfast.\n\n### Input (2):A store manager is trying to calculate how much of a certain item needs to be in stock to last a certain amount of time, assuming no new items will be ordered for that period of time. In 10 days, 4500 people come into the store to buy an item, and they purchase 125 items on average. If that is going on for 30 days, how many items do you need to keep in stock, on average, for each day?\n\n### Response (2):You need 4,500/125=<<4500/100=45>>45 or just over one extra for 30 days.\n\n### Rationales (2-4):1.  If 4500/<<4500=4500/45=100>>100 items are sold per day, then if we add 1 extra item to the end of that day, they will be able to sell that item the next day.\n\n2.  The number of extra items needed is 4500*1/<<450/60=450/6<<6=1>>1\n\n3.  If 4,50 people bought 125 items, 45 would buy 1,025 = <<45*1=45>>47 items, so if 4500 buy 125, around 98,000 would buy 100.\n\n### Conclusion:You need 45 extra items, not counting the one that is already in stock, which is 451 extra for a store that sells 125 items.\n\n### Output:This is your answer, or at least the most likely answer, assuming that you use the instructions correctly.

The antifreeze he uses for his pick-up truck is a 10 percent solution of antifreeze and water.  John knows that one gallon of antifreeze will freeze at 31\u00b0 below zero.  If he adds 3 gallons of water to every 2 gallons of antifreeze before adding water to his tank, what is the maximum temperature the gas tank can safely operate without freezing at?\n\n### Response/Explanation: Since they add three gallons of water for every two gallons of antifrite they end up with a solution that is ten percent, hence there a two to three ratio to the water, which when you subtract from 10, leaves 8 % of water and 92 % of antifriete. From that percentage, 92% of the antifriete is 8.4 gallons of antifriete and he'll measure the amount of water at 3 gallons of antifrie, but since there is 1% of water subtracted from the 2 gallons that add up to 3.  the final temperature is 1% so it adds up to thirty-eight degrees below freezing and will operate at that degree.\n\n### Rationales: This question is asking you to solve the 10% of antifriete with two to three gallons of water and have you arrive at 38\u00b0 below freezing for the gas to work properly.\n\n### 2017\n    Input: The ratio of cakes that Shirley sells in her shop is 7 to 6.

He keeps his livestock at 750 feet above sea level.   In the winter, the average temperature is 20 degrees F above 0C, and in the summer 15 degrees F above 0.  He charges per gallon for milk.  If he has a large herd (>7000) with an average of 7 gallons per cow, then he will use $168,000 in feed.  How many acres does John have?\nRationalesTo solve this problem, we can use a proportion.\nThere are 365 days a year divided among 2 seasons. We can use 365/2 in each season.  So, the total amount of days= 365*2 = <<365*2=730>>730 days\nThe average temperature is 750 x (20-0) =<<750*(20-0)=1500>>1500*2 = <<1500*5=7500>>7500\nJohn uses 168000 in feeds for every 7000.  So, this is 1680/7 = <<1680/6=277>>277 feeds\nFor 277 feeds, John will use 1680*.277 = <<165*8=~1310>>1310 feeds per each cows.\nSo, 1680*2 is divided by 7 then multiply by 1310\n====>3578 feeds are used for 7000 cattle.\nBut each feeds costs 7$\nSo, 3578*7 = <<3578*4=14392>>14392 are used\nThe total feeds for the cows are 14392\nThe cows produces 7 gallons of milk.\nSo, 7*14392 = <<7*14389=100", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

{"text": "Choices:  A \n\n### Instructions:\nWhat is the probability that a bag of M&Ms will have no yellow M&Ms if the bag contains 15 M&Ms in total?\n#### 1/2\nAnswer: \n\n### Procedure:\nA bag of M&M\u00aes contains 15 candies total. Of those 15, there are 14 different colors in the bag total (including 1 brown). The probability that a M&M\u00ae will be chosen at random is 1/15. If yellow M&M\u00aes are chosen out of the 15 total candies, then 7/15 M&M\u00ae bags will be chosen at random. Thus, there is 1/12 probability that a yellow M&M\u00ae will NOT be present due to the random selection of 7/12 M&M\u00ae baggies where the yellow M&M\u00ae is selected at random. The probability that the bag does not contain a yellow M&M is 1/14, which shows the lack of randomness since it is the only color not present in the bag. Thus if there is no color in the bag, the probability is 1/1. However, since the bag consists of 14 different colors, the chance of this happening is still quite low. This is shown by the fact that it is 1/116. Thus, the probability that there is a M&M\u00ae color present in the bag is 1/1-1/14 (or 115/14), which calculates out to 1/15 that the probability that this bag does not have a yellow M&M will not happen.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n### Instrumental variable(s):\n##### (if any):\n\n### EDA:", "answer": "E: reproduce"}

The string is converted to a filename by the function by converting the string to a byte array.\nRationale: The \"?\" can be one of two things, it can either mean to make a single question mark (so it can be used for things like when you are showing that an input is optional or when you need a variable name).\nOr it can mean a \"wildcard\" like? means all files in a chosen directory, and with the addition of * it can mean all files that begin with a particular name.\n\nThe \"?\" by itself isn't a wildcard, but we can make it one by adding a wildcard character like * or?.? here serves as a wildcard, the? is saying to ignore", "answer": "B: nodding"}

There are a variety of number line templates in Excel, as the image below demonstrates:\n\nThe template at the bottom-right has every single number up to 1000 on it. It also includes several shades of gray that indicate \u201cin between\u201d numbers as indicated by the dashed lines in front of the numbers and the dotted line in front of the number 500. Dotted and dashed lines can also be used with different shades of gray to indicate a wide range of numbers.\nThe following steps will build a simple template that includes numbers from 1 to 100.\n\n#### Step 1: Copy text to cell B1\n\n1. Open Excel and make a copy of the above template.\n2. Using the Home tab, click Clipboard and click Clear Clipboard. This will delete the text in A1 and A2.\n3. Repeat step 2 if the text in A1:A2 does not disappear after pressing Clear Clipboard. Excel clears the clipboard before it will copy any text there. This might be confusing at first!\n4. Select A1:A2 and then type 1 in cell A1 and copy the contents of cell A2 to cell B1. This will create a blank template as shown in the image above.\n5. Change the font to", "answer": "B: large room"}

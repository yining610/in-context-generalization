She likes a 20-ounce cup, but she can't drink coffee without adding sugar to it. She likes two teaspoons for every cup she drinks, but she often drinks four cups and uses four teaspoons of sugar for each. How much sugar can she use if she fills up a 20-cup sugar container?\nAnswer: 20 teaspoons\n\nThe woman can fill up 20 cups of sugar using her 20-ounce bag at two teaspoons per cup. This will use 1/2 teaspoon of sugar per ounce used, so 20 ounces of sugar used will be equivalent to 40 teaspoons. She likes to drink 4 cups of coffee with 4 teaspoons of coffee in each, making a total of 16 ounces of coffee (4 X 4 cups) per cup. If she is filling her 20-cup container with sugar by only putting in the equivalent amount of sugar to that of her 20-ounces containers of coffee, then she will use 40 teas of sugar.\n\n### The solution uses the same logic except that she uses the formula C +S = 10 which results in a different solution.\n### Write the formula you used to solve the problem.\n\n`x*2` equals 20 ounCES of sugar.\n\nHow much sugar is inside a 20-CUp Sugar CUp\n### Instruction \n\nAnswer the question(s).\n### Input\nInput:\nHow much do you pay to get your hair done every 5 months?\nAnswer: $285\n\n\n### Response \n\nHair was cut every 5 months\n4 haircuts: $111/hair cut\n1\n\n### Demorization\n\n` x = 5`\n\nhair", "answer": "E: airport"}

{"text": "What is the number of hours Sarah will spend cleaning up the mess?\n\n### Output: A: 4 hours B: 11 hours C: 4 hours D: 13 hours E: 2 hours\n\n### Output Explanation: A: She has to wipe up the ink.  When each wipe takes at least an hour, and she's cleaned the mess twice. B: She has to take out her old rug and take her new rug to the store.  It will take an hour to unpack the new rug and wipe up the old rug. After that, she will need to pack up her new rug and will be spending 2 hours transporting it and bringing it into the house again. C: She will take both her old and new rug outside and pack it into her new car. While this takes longer, it is more efficient.  With a car, she can go as fast to the store as she wants and can take her rug right in the room.  But if she has to take it outside to clean, we are now using up 4 hours of transportation. D: She can go inside the store to get her new rug.  It takes 30 minutes at the most for the delivery to the new house. So after wiping the old rug, unpacking the new rug, and putting the old rug away, she still has 2 more hours left. E: We can reuse the old rug. The old rug's packaging will be left behind to clean up. So she only has to spend 2 hours cleaning up the mess.", "answer": "C: desk"}

What would the cost to erect a 9-foot banner be for 3 months if the cost is $25 per month and one square foot cost $0.25?\n\nErecting banners is a project in town. One banner is going to be displayed for 3 months. So, there are 2700 square feet. If each banner is 9 foot, then we can say that each banner will take 2700 sq.ft divided by 9 feet = about 30 banners. So, each banner will take about 30 or so sq.ft/month. As given in the question, each banner costs $25/month. So, we can calculate the cost to display all the banners for 3 months like this:\n\nCost to display all banners for 1 banner for 1 months = $25\n\nCost to display banners for all banners for duration 3 months = $25 * 3 = $75\n\nSo, the cost to display ALL banners for a duration of 3 months is $75.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThis program does exactly what the request states. It gives the cost to erect 5 banners for 9-foot banners, so it displays them for 3 months.\n\n### Comments:\n\nYou should consider using a `do...while()` loop for this program.

In 1820, as stated by Wikipedia, the US census for 1820 states 9,825,894 people lived in America.  Therefore, this data set is not linear. To solve in logarithms:\n\n1820 = 9,826017,036\n\n1930 = 141,101,548\n\nIn 1820 there were 0.983x10^6 people living in America.\n\nWe can convert this to log using the LN function:\n\n`LN(9,826,018,685) = 3.72188164926398`\n\n`LN($US population in 1990) - LN($US population in1820).`\n\n`Rationalizing the denominator we get: 3.72250018479020`\n\n`3.722 - 3.720 = 0.002`\n\nSo the answer is about 2 million off.

The product of a and sin(2t) is the sine function with the argument 2t+a. By using the identity sin(2x+y) = sin(2x)cos (y) \u2013 sin(y) cos (2x), we can express the above as the sum of two sums, where one expresses the second summation in terms of the first as in (I), and the other does the same as in (II).

Choices: A - 40, B - 45, C - 65, D - 75, E - 180\n\n\n### Answer : E\n\n\n### Explanation : Because you are trying to find the total number of miles he drives, so he is either driving to or from the beach. So if he is driving to the beach, it will only be half the time. If he is driving back, it will be a full trip.\n\n### Examples\nAdam drives to the beach. He drives back home.\nA -> 40, B -> 45\n\nAdam drives to beach, drives back home, then drives to the beach again.\nA -> 80, B -> 90\n\n### Adam drives to beach, drives home, then drives back.\nA -> 110, B -> 115\n\n## Input: How much does Adam pay for his apartment per week?\n\n## A):\n400\n\n## B):\n500\n\n## C):\n650\n\n## D):\n250\n\n## E):\n350\n\n## Answer:\nC\n\nAdam needs shelter for 4 nights a week for a month.

{"text": "The correct answer is'school band'.\n\n### Justification:\n1. The choices do not make sense.\n2. Bass clarinet is not something that is typically available at a music store, so the correct answer should be'school.' The same thing can be said about 'home,' as bass clarinets can be easily damaged or need to be cared for much more frequently than instruments such as violins or cellos. \n3. Bass clarinet is a fairly typical instrument in a band, but an instrument like that would be more useful in a school setting. \n\n\n\n### Input:[Sally and Jack run a restaurant. They start with their inventory including enough food to run their 5 day menu which serves 80 customers per day over 2000 square meters. Sally is a cook and Jack is a dishwasher. They are looking at opening the restaurant for lunch at 10 am. After 8 hours, Jack is the only person remaining and it is nearly time to close. At this time, what was the maximum number of customers expected to walk through their door?]\n\n### Response:[The answer is 180 which is from a combination of calculating all possible ways at which the customers can enter the the total of all possible combinations. The question only mentions that there are 2000 sq meters in the dining room so it would be 1000 times 2 so this would make the total number of possible customers per day 2000 times 10 for a total of 20,000 customers possible. Then to start with the inventory we can think of every possible option that can happen with a person or a customer as one unit and just see what the total number of possible units we have. This would give us the option of either a 8/8 combination with 8 units, a 7/9 with 7 units, 7/7 with 7 units, etc. and 5/10 with 10 units. Also one could add that in the end of the day Jack would do the dishes so there would be 0 possible dishes to dish and one could calculate the number of combinations of 0 and 1 for customers. The answer would be 20000 combinations with 5 combinations of 0 and also 1 combination of 1. Adding this this would", "answer": "C: music store"}

{"text": "B\n\nA table is very useful at home, and people usually put them in the dining room, which they use to sit and eat with their families. If there was no dining room, then people would put the table in their living room. This is because people can use it for playing board games, or even for setting a TV atop of the table.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n- The task asks whether the table could be in the house. Since a table by definition is in the house, then putting it somewhere else makes no sense.\n- There are five choices so the correct answer is either B or E since A, C, D are nonsensical.\n- The first two choices are incorrect because a table in a library makes no sense.  A library has too many books to fit a table.  Also, the library is a place for education and a table cannot be used for this\n- The third choice is incorrect because we are specifically trying to determine whether the table can be in the house.  We are not trying to determine where else it can be put.\n- The fourth choice is incorrect because a rug does not really allow you to play a board game on it, nor does it really allow you to put anything else on it, nor does a rug allow you to put a table on it.\n\n### Further Discussion:\nIt would make more sense to put the table on a piece of floor if you had a rug on it because you could put a rug on and on top of your rug you would have your table. This way you can make your rug more beautiful, which is something that is not really the main purpose of a table (at least for a house).\n\n### Instructor's Insight:Instructions and tasks like this teach the students not only critical thinking and logical reasoning necessary for the success, but may even be applied on other areas of development of the students, such as leadership and team development.", "answer": "C: corner"}

{"text": "Answer: Increase\n\n### Why?:This answer is what I think the correct answer is based on the question the information the question asked for and the information I have found and used. I also thought this because of the words \"heat up\" which I thought meant to get hotter. However since the \"hotter\" meant more hot, I was mistaken and was wrong. My answer was also correct because I know the fact that if the sun is out, then it means it is warming up. If it's cooling down then it has to be because of the sun and that happens at night. So I was also able to add the fact that temperature change rapidly, to mean that the temperature is constantly changing, so its going up and down quickly. So I can also conclude that there's no way the temperature can drop to zero because if it is zero no sun or heat from the sun can be present which means no heat can be present.\n\n### Input2:A 60-foot tree was planted in a park 2 years ago.  Over the last year there has been a 2.5% growth rate.  How many inches tall is the tree today?\n\n### Response2:Answer:160\n\n### Why:Since the question had me asked to estimate what I thought the answer was I thought since growth was 2.5%, (60 x 2.5) = 150. So I had to add the 150 to what the question originally asked which was a 60-foot-tree. I originally thought the answer would have been 63 because I originally thought that the 2.5% was a % increase and 60 x 1.025 = 63.

{"text": "**(Choose from the given answers)** A\n\n### Explanation:\nShe may have tried to gain more weight in general but failed miserably, but not her waist in particular. Hence, A is the correct answer. Other options fail to meet the criteria for the prompt.\n\n### Input:-\nThe current price of a house is $123,467. If you increase 99.53% of the number, you get 29531. If you decrease 93.88% of the number, how close will you get to the original price?\n\n### Expected Solution:-\nYou are looking to create two numbers using the 99.5 and 93.8 that give you as close to the original price as possible.  So we need numbers that equal or come close to 124,000.\nTo get there, we need to add 1700 so that it becomes 125,700. In order to go to 124000, you would reduce it by 1490. Hence, (125700)(0.17) rounded to the nearest thousand = 21892.25\n\n### Solution:\nTo get there, you would reduce it 1490 and then add to the closest 100, which is 1491.\n\n### Solution for Solution:\n12400 = 125x700\n12401 = 125.x701\n12402 = 12502\n...\n124x700 = 1700\n\n### What about that weird last problem where we were finding out the product of 125.7?\n\nWhy would we multiply by 0.17? If we have a number, let say 125000 and want to find the new number you get if we multiply by 1.17, we create a \"new variable,\" let us call it \"new number\". We would say,\n\n(12500.17) * 10,000 = 130500 new number\n\nBy using 0.17", "answer": "A: gain weight"}

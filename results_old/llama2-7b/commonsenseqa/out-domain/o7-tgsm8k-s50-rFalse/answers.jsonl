The second part of the problem relates to where Ben was when he went into the accident.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe first part was to determine where Ben had been during the time that he was an alcohol.  In my opinion, the answer would be that Ben had been in prison. During this time, Ben was an alcoholic, and because of that he couldn't get out fast enough, and so he stayed in the area longer than the people who weren't alcoholics.\n\nThe second part dealt with where Ben was during the accident.  It was said that because of Ben's mistake he spent 8 years in a bridge, or somewhere that wasn't home.  In my opinion Ben was homeless, and so he spent the night somewhere other than his house.  However, we can't assume this based off of the information that we are given.\n\n### Explanation\n\nAs we can see from the story, Ben had spent 8 years as an alcoholic.  Ben was in prison for about 7 years of these 8, and then spent the remainder of the 8 years as a homeless person.  In my opinion this could change though.  Because alcoholism is a disease and Ben was in prison for 7 years, we can't say the for sure that Ben wasn't homeless before.  However, this is merely one of the many possibilities that could have happened.  That's why I consider the story to be not entirely factual, and my response to this question would be that Ben was locked up during this time.\n\n### Revised Question\n\n\n### How could you change this to provide a more detailed explanation?\n\n\n### Did you find this answer useful?\n\n\n## Comments\n\n\n## Reader comments", "answer": "A: prison"}

That way I don't overthink it because I tried a few different outcomes then I can get it all down in writing and then I don't over think it when I just re write the steps I took to come to different solutions. I then look at the multiple choice answers and find the answer they are asking from the different number of problems and then I am done. \n\nThis method works very well in figuring out the answers to most of the questions.\n\n### Challenges:\nI do not feel there is much of a challenge with figuring out problems. There are many different solutions and the only struggle I really face is figuring out which one is the best solution. I have to keep thinking of many different things then I have to try and see if the solutions I have come up are the best way to solve the problem. \n\n### Skill sets and strategies:\nIn this first set of tutorials I had learned and practiced a wide variety of things.

{"text": "Please pick C.\n\n### Explanation:\nUnder the bed is where a lot of people keep their unwanted items and where they like to store bags of junk. A bedroom and closet is where people place things the they regularly use and the space is limited in the bedroom so keeping an instrument in the bedroom would not be desirable. A music store is probably out of the question as well since they do not need to buy an instrument for their own personal use and the music store is not the best place to get rid of their old instruments. A symphony is where people go to listen to a performance, not where they keep an instrument. And finally, Band practice is where a band of musicians practice their musical abilities, not where they keep their instruments.\n\n### Response2:\nPlease pick B.\n\n###Explanation:\nAn adult has more experience and a better understanding of music than a child and would therefore do a better job of putting the instrument in the correct place.  This reasoning would apply for almost any situation. \n\n###Response 3:\nPlease pick A.\n\n###Explaination:\nThe answer should have been picked to be B, but choosing A is not entirely wrong since the child might have found the instrument they wanted to play and will have the parents to guide them to what the correct place to put their instrument is.\n\n###Response4:\nPlease pick C\n\n###Exaplanation:\nKeeping the instrument under the bed will cause the item to be covered in dust and it will take more effort to keep the space clean and it could end up getting dusty again. This type of clutter is always more likely to get damaged or broken.  If the instrument is stored in a space with plenty of breathing room it will not have to be covered in dust or become broken and damaged more easily. \n\n## Instruction:\nDescribe the data on the graph below.\n\n```\n\n### Solution:\nThe data displays 2 separate linear graphs, one graph has a starting value of 0,0061 and the other a value of 0,103.

Since I was able to successfully remove 40, and get the equation to zero, this algorithm can be successfully used to solve the problem.\n  </p> \n  <pre class=\"brush:html\">\n  <p>Input: The difference in age between Lily and Katie is 5.

{"text": "B\nYou are correct. The sentence that I provided is correct. However, there were a few things I wanted to point out.\nFor starters, I think there is more than \"a couple of spelling and grammar errors.\" As your sentence is missing some necessary punctuation, the reader may not be able to tell the difference between an independent clause and a coordinating conjunction. Moreover, the sentence could be reworded in several ways to better express my idea. If it is important that the sentence remain grammatically correct, I believe that it would be best for the sentence to be edited by a more experienced writer or editor.\n\nI also think that the sentence could be rephrased to better reflect its overall message. For example, you describe John as \"stuck\" in his house due to the fact that he couldn't get out of it. However, I feel that the verb \"stuck\" does not adequately describe the reader's reaction when the smoke detectors go off. For example, using words like \"frightened\" or \"afraid,\" would probably sound better.\n\nFinally, I believe that you should have used a different verb in line two, the word \"frightened\" in line one doesn't make sense. For instance, if John was scared, you could say something like: \"Luckily for him, it was only a false alarm.\"\n\nAll in all, this is a great activity and I think everyone should participate in it.\n\n### Input 2: You buy a car\n\n### Response 2:I will take the car.\n\n### Response\nThe idea of writing a response is to improve your vocabulary and spelling. If you can, the more you try to avoid using words like \"you\" and \"me.\" For example, instead of saying \"you have to pay more for gas\" you should write something like, \"you will have to plan your budget.\"\n\nFor the sentences you write, it's important you use accurate grammar and spelling. You should also avoid making mistakes by using correct punctuation, such as commas, periods, and question marks.\n\nIt's also important to use proper syntax or sentence structure when writing a response. In your examples, \"I take the car\" and \"I will take the car\" should be written in the same way. You don't need to give yourself", "answer": "C: winter storm"}

When you divide 8 by a fraction, it gives you a remainder after you end the division problem.\n\n### In this example, the remainder that you will obtain when you divide 8 with 2/3 is 2. When you divide 2 by 4 it gives you a remainder of 0 and so 2 divided by 4 =3.\n\n### Examples:\n\nDividing 8 by 0 = remainder 0\n\nDividing by number by by 1/0 = remainder 1\n\nDividing a whole number by a rational number = remainder\n\nRationalizing a fraction = to getting rid of the remainder and converting to a decimal.", "answer": "E: cure"}

When she entered the store, she no longer needed to use the door to check in with the worker and get a number to wait to enter. The worker was still outside, but now she just asked shoppers to look at the big sheet in front of her that told her how many were allowed in the store at one time. The clerk was now behind a plexiglass barrier. No one could touch or go near the clerk, but if they needed help, Jill could just ask a question and then they could communicate through the barrier. Instead of touching the clothing and bringing it to the counter, Jill could go to the mirror at the end of a display and use the mirror to touch each item on the outside of the display. Jill could then select her items and leave instead of waiting to pay. At the fitting room, Jill would enter, but before she could get dressed in her items, she would get scanned so that the workers would know who was in the fitting room. As Jill got dressed, she didn\u2019t have to touch the items in her dressing room since the tags would be scanned to tell the employee they were all hers.\n\n### Inputs 2:\nSamantha was in her favorite toy store this past week and went to try out the new changes that were put in to keep the shoppers safe from Covid.

After filling in the information, the worker would check to see how many people were waiting in line. Once that number reached zero, they would take the white board outside and allow the customers in. People didn't have to wait to check out, so the lines were short and the whole shopping experience was much faster. There were no cashiers at the front of the store.

Let's say A is larger than B by a fixed amount.\n### Step 2:\nThese problems are also divided into 2 steps. I.e. we need to find what the larger quantity is in both problems, then calculate the smaller quantity. To find the larger quantity, use the following equation :\n![](pic-01.png){:.center-image height=\"400px\" width=\"600px\":}\n\n### Step 3:\nIf we find out which one is larger, we can calculate the other. The only time we can\u2019t find the other number in one of the above calculations is when the first number is exactly 1 less than the second number. If it is exactly 1 less.\n![](pic-11.png){:.center-image height=\"600px\"}\n\nThis is the only time when the calculation will not be 1 less than the first number. We use this case (where the first and second numbers are exactly 1 less than each other) where no formula can be calculated. \n\nIn other words, we need to divide the first number by the formula in 36 to find out how big the second number and then to divide the second number by the same formula again to find out how big its first number is. We did division in all our solutions and not multiplications. \n\nLet's take a look:\n![A, B, formula; 36](pic-02.png){:.right-image height=\"450px\" width=\"450px\"}\n\nIn this case the difference between them is exactly 1 so we got the original formula. \n![A, B; 36; A, B;2(36)](pic-03.png){:.left-image height=\"420px\" width=\"350px\"}\n![", "answer": "E: airport"}

I have done this and it has made my find what I need much easier to do. However, I learned that it is sometimes easier to put clothes in a clear bin, then color code the bags.  This is also what I use in my shop that I run with my wife.  The benefits of using colors is that you know where something is without even looking closely and sometimes it takes the clutter away from your closet.  But if you use colors, you will get bored, and that is when it is easier to sort your items in clear bags.  That way you can easily reorganize and you never get bored.  This is what we do in my shop.  As far as dresser drawers, I would probably organize them by type and lay them out in a way that makes sense. This makes it easier to find specific items and it allows you to see all the items you will need or have for a specific task or event.\n\n### Additional Information \n\nThe organizing of the items depends on the amount of stuff you have.", "answer": "C: pay bills"}

If the final score where 4-3(even), then there is no need to add more point to it because it is already even.\nThe question is asking about the situation where the next score was 5-3 (scores differ by 2 not 3) and the answer was that there was 1 point because the last score was the final score, it's 5 (5-3=2 and it is not the final score).\n\n### Input to solve:  You have 90 gears in your motor.

Each group was assigned to a tutor at $8 per hour per student, except one group where the tutor charged $9 per hour and taught 2 students. The rest of the tutors charged between $5 per hour for the lowest level to $8 per hour for the highest level. Each group was charged a rate of $5 for group tutoring. How much more did the last tutor make than the rest of the tutors combined?\n#### Answer\n\n$125.\n#### Explanation\nThe lowest level of students got the lowest tutor price.

He gets 2 boxes, so he pays $2.68. So Shawn's allowed budget is $2.68 for two boxes. He has $20, so he can buy 7 boxes with his given budget.\n\n\n### Part II\n\n#### Answer: $4.83\n\n#### Explorations\n\nShawn will only buy as many boxes as his budget allows.

In fact, you probably won't need an input at all. Instead, the computer will generate randomized inputs for you to try the methods on. To help get you started, check out the example code below. In this example, the computer will generate inputs, and then the functions will solve the problems for you.  All you need to do is call the functions in the correct order. \n\n- Here is how your functions should be formatted. Your inputs should be defined as integers because these are the only kinds of values the computer can understand. When defining your functions, make sure to include the name of the function, a space, and your parameter. You can use whatever names you want. \n\n- The name of your function should match the parameter you supply. \n\n- After you define your function, you can add a print function to your code. This will print the actual value that you supplied in the input.  So for example, if  you want to print the value 35 to the screen, your code would be:  \n`print(\"the input number was 35\")`\n\n- If you want to print the parameter value in the function call, you can call the print function again after you define the function and pass the parameter to it. \n\n### Example", "answer": "C: wrong house"}

I also think it's easier to read than the other options and it keeps everything in order instead of having to do math to figure things out which I personally don't like to do. I also used a lot of common sense in my answer instead of trying to figure the answer out mathematically.\n\n### What were your initial responses?: Was there a pattern, structure, or routine that you followed in your approach to this assignment?

Did you use any resources (examples, websites, etc.) or any other outside help (classmates, friends, etc.) to help you?\nI don't really follow an exact pattern or structure when it came to writing my answers, but I did follow my instincts and my common sense more than anything to help me figure out the problem, like for the part of \"The total sales of the six companies was more than the sales of any one of the individual companies\". I chose to explain things using an equation instead of trying to write it out in words and since I'm good at geometry, I chose to use triangles to make it simpler, even though that's probably not the exact right way to explain this problem. I also didn't do to much research like I normally would since I have a lot of research papers due in my other class. I used this website to help me with the questions I couldn't answer and I asked a few of my friends as well for different examples of how to phrase certain questions so I could get a better idea of the assignment since I do write my answers phonetically so it's harder to understand what I wrote.\n\n### If you are happy with this response, please complete the rest of the form below...\n\n### What did you learn from this assignment?

Also, the bank does not collect interest on 1.06 and why would the bank charge 3x the interest if the loaned amount is only 1.06%. Finally, since 56% of the bank fee was due to your late payment of $1.07, the bank has effectively loaned $1. If $1 has been borrowed at an interest rate of 25% per month for a period of 8 months, the bank is required to pay 150% (3x56, rounded) = $1.5 + the $1.07 that was previously due.

Choices: A: 1.22 miles B: 0.13 miles C: 1.20 miles D: 10.12 miles \n\nRational es: With the 200 foot light house, if we know that we can see a light house up until 12 miles, then if you get 5000 = >>5000/12=416.667>>416.667 This lets us know the conversion factor. Since the 200 light house was seen from 12 miles away, then the 12,500 height makes the conversion of 416.67(12,501)\nWe are able to use the conversion to get the distance of light house. Thus, we can use 416.7 to figure out 5000 because we know that 416.5 is what we should get. Therefore, we have 416.005.

{"text": ">Answer the question you were given in the first paragraph. Please see how to write a formal response as well as the answer you have selected. When making choices, consider the meaning and purpose of each word in your list. \n  \nRationales: Live animals can be both individual people (a person with a living animal, such as a pet) and a species of animal as a whole. For instance, bacteria are a species of living animals. Thus, all mammals are living animals, but animals with hearts may not necessarily be living creatures. Only mammals are likely to have caring hearts. In order to have a caring heart, someone must be a living animal. Therefore, A and E are false as none of those things are mammals (and B is a species of animal and D is individual animals, of which E fits none of A, B, C, or D). Mammals, on the other hand, have living hearts. Therefore, mammals have caring hearts.\n\n#### Live Animal\nAnswer: A\n\n### Input:(Josh, the dog.) In this example, Josh refers to an animal\nChoices:  A: Josh is a dog B: Josh is a pig C: Josh is a horse D: Josh is a cow E: Josh is a rat\n\n### Response\nI think A is the correct answer because the context of the story states that there is a dog named Josh, and the dog is the referent of the word Josh. This is another example of a pronoun referring back to something that already exists.\nWhen a pronoun in this position refers to a nonliving object rather than an animate object, it is called a subject pronoun. But Josh is a dog. It is animate, so it is a subject pronoun.\n\n#### Josh\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A: person"}

Later, a skyscraper was built in Japan that was taller. But the Empire State building is still very tall and is often viewed from other famous buildings.\n\n### Rationales:The skyscraper is in Japan.

We draw the smaller circle with radius r = <<r=92.72>>85, but we want to make sure it doesn't cut off the first circle. To be double sure, we make it 88 so the top and bottom are still connected.\n\n### Answer 1: A\n\n### Rationale: The equation for the radii of the circle is r = d = (2 x d / \u03c0) + d / 2\n  d = 92.2 inches, which is about 0.75 feet\n  The radius r = 88 inches, which is about.8 feet\n  The radii of the two circles are 92 and 88 \nInput:\nr = d = (2 d / \u03a0) + d/2\n88 = (2 x 88 / 3.141592) + 88 /2 = <<88=3.1412>>2.14\n  so the answer to the question ___ feet is the correct one\nInput:\n  The equation for the radians is r = d = 2 d / \u03c0 +d/2\n  Our answer is 88 = 2 x 88/(3.1416) + 88/2\n  So the answer to the question with the answer of 88 has a radian of (3.141 x 8", "answer": "E: tall"}

How many chairs does he have now?\nRationales (answer in base ten): The original total number of chairs is 1 because that's all he had to begin with.\nThe total number of additional chairs that he can add to the original total will multiply to a number of 2 in the total set of chairs because he cannot add a 2 to an original 1 or anything smaller.\nIn other words, if he were to add a 2 to a 1, the new number would then be 3, which isn't in the set of 1 to begin with if we're only using base ten.\nAdding 2 to the original 1 in the total set of 1 chair, Jonathan will have a new total of 3 chairs, which does not exist as an original set of 1 chair.

Option A, \"a group of things\", is incorrect-- while a fraction is a representation of a group of things, the fraction itself is not a group of things. So, we are left with options B, C, and E. Option B, \"part of a whole\", is incorrect because while a fraction (part) divided by a whole (the original group of things) is a fraction (part of a whole), that is not necessarily what is being asked here. Furthermore, it is possible for \"a part of a whole\" to not be a fraction (for example, the square in a quarter can be interpreted as two different fractions, [7/4](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/frc23b.htm) and [11/4](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/115352/a-quarter-as-two-fractions) because they are both different fractions). So, we are left to consider options C and E. Option C is correct because a division is [an equal division of objects](https://mathbits.com/mathbits/home/fractprt.html).

You're looking for Tapanga and Coreys total candy count. 2. You're looking to see if Corey got his candy after he went hunting.\n\n### Answer:2\n\n### Response:\nCorey got his candy.\n\n### Explain\n\nThe answer can be derived by analyzing the input. We can infer that Corey doesn't have 8. The only way Corey can have 29 candies is if he has at least 8.\nBut how do we know that? Well, Corey knows that his candies add up to 29. If Corey had 8, he would have 37 candies and Tapanga would have 28. But if Corey has 28 or less, he can have at most 29 total and Corey would know the amount of candies Tapanya had. So based on this info, Freddy can assume Corey's candies are at least 8. Since he doesn't have that many candies, Corey must have 8.\n\n### 2. This isn't a task.\n\n### Response 2.\n\nI think this input is a task.\n\nThis would mean that Freddy calls his father and his brother in the same day, spending $5.50 each time. Freddy calls his father first, spending $5 and then his father calls back at $.25 cents a second. For Freddy to spend $5.50 that means one minute would cost $5.25 and two minutes would cost $9.50.

If Kyle ran each side of his triangle in equal increments of time, how many minutes and 0.5 seconds did it take him to make the complete return trip?\nRationales Answer 2: The original question is a statement about the distance Kyle ran on a triangle path, not about the return trip. Since Kyle ran each side in the same amount of time, then he ran a distance 12 + 10/2 that was the same as the return trip. Since the triangle path was 200 meters long, Kyle would have ran 200 \u00d7 (12 + 11)/2 = 200 \u00d7 6 = 1200 meters.\nRationales Answer: First, we find the distance traveled by taking the difference between the distances covered", "answer": "D: cant do"}

{"text": "> I believe B would fit this question the best, because thinking is a passive function and does not make you tired. \n\n#### B\n\n### Input\nThe Earth's atmosphere contains many layers of gases. As a satellite orbits the Earth, it leaves these gases behind. How far away from the Earth could a stationary observer measure such gases in the atmosphere?\n\n#### Answer 1:\nI believe this question can be answered based on volume. If you have 20% more gas above the Earth than you have below the Earth, you have the potential to have 50% less gas than you have below the earth in order to maintain the same volume. In order to maintain the same density, though, you will have to have something of equivalent density below the Earth but with volume being removed. Water is about 1000 times denser than air, so you will need 50000x less water to have the same volume but keep the same density. I think that if you were stationary, you would have space at that point but you wouldn't be able to see the gas because of the volume of water.\n\n### Answer 2:\nI think you could make this comparison as well as your previous one. If a satellite left 20% less gas than before, then they could probably have 50% more gas than before when they came back down to the Earth (remember, in vacuum space, each planet has the same mass but different volume). This is all assuming that no gases are mixed - it doesn't matter if you left the Earth with exactly as much helium as hydrogen (these two are the two most abundant elements) as you didn't take anything with you when you left. However, if you leave a planet with the same elements and are just making this analogy then it won't work, but if gas gets exchanged then you have the same elements before and after.\n\nMy answer didn't really make any sense. I don't really understand this problem well enough.\n\n#### Answer 3:\nMy original answer was, simply, as far as you could possibly go in space. According to this question, however, not all atmospheric gases are necessary the same. To clarify, there are multiple layers of different atmospheric gases, each with different densities and volumes, so I", "answer": "B: think"}

For instance, to make 20/7 of a number, add 20 to itself 7 times, which is the same as adding 207/7.\nIf we want to multiply a number by 3/5, then we can just add 3/5 to itself 5 times, which is the identical as adding 3*5 /5.\nIn case you would like to find the proportion of a number, then divide the fraction into the denominator.\n\nInput: The recipe for cupcakes calls for 3 cups of sugar to be mixed with 3 cups of flour, 1 egg, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 2/3 cup vanilla extract. How many cups of 2% milk do I need to add?\nThe solution: To solve this, we can add the same fraction to its own number. If we want to be sure of the sum, we have to find how to find the proportion of two numbers, then you can find how to find the resultant.\nWhen you know how to find the result, you will figure out how much you need to mix or how much you need for each cup of ingredients you have.\n\nInput: You are making 10 brownies and you need some ingredients to make them.

{"text": "store\nRationales: Furniture stores get used by thousands of people every day. They keep different kinds of furniture for their clients.\nSo an arm chair you will only rarely find is a used one at a furniture store.\nIf you need an armchair, you should seek one at an apartment or study.\nHospitals and doctors' offices rarely use arm chairs and they keep only a few of them.\n### Instruction answer choice: A\n\n### Input Choices:\n- A 10 gallon tank holds a total of 168 gallons of water. \n- B One month's supply of water for a household costs approximately $40. \n- C A person uses about 100 gallons of water per day. \n- D $2 per gallon \n- E 50% reduction in water supply is considered serious for many people\nRationales: The reduction in water might have different effects on different people.\nHowever, to reduce by 50% will take a month of effort and extra expenses for water. For instance, if the amount paid for water is $600 per month and the reduction would cost $1000 to reduce the cost by 50%, then that would be a serious reduction.\nThe tank of water you have is already much bigger than what you might need. The amount of water the tank could accommodate will be determined by the people who use it. For instance, if 100 people are using that tank and they consume less water than the capacity of the tank, the amount of water they will use will be reduced. If it will not be reduced according to the use of the people, the extra water can be saved somewhere else. The people will likely continue to use the same amount even when the tank capacity is much less.\nFor instance, they would use 168 gallon tank at the full capacity and not think of reducing it. If the amount used is 100 gallon per day and the number of people is about 3000, and the tank has space for that many gallons, the reduction is not expected.\nHowever, if the reduced water could be saved and used for the 2000 people using 100 gallone per day, that will be a serious reduction. There is a possibility that the tank would not hold much", "answer": "D: study"}

A supermarket is \"a self-service retail store for food and household goods; a supermarket is a store where you can shop at a grocery store.\" Let's look at choices A, B, and E.

In order to make a small splas, throw it to a river from ground, because if you throw it to a mountain, it will land too far from the shore. 2. in order to make a large splash, you throw it upwards, this is an assumption that river is not too deep, so if you throw it from a bridge or a mountainside, it will land too deep. And if river is too deep, you can't break the surface. 3. In order to make the water warmer than fresh water, throw it directly to the ocean not at the countryside, if you throw it at the ocean it will land directly on the saltwater, so it will not cool it down. 4.

At noon, there are no horses in the race. When a horse joins the race, you must wait 30 minutes until another horse joins it. There are ten seconds between horse arrivals, and a horse leaves the race when no horses remain in the race. How long after noon will the last horse leave the race?\nRationales.To get the total time that the races will lasts, the first horse needs to be there for 30 minutes. Then the second horse needs to be there, the third horse needs to be there and so on. By this thought pattern, I get (30*10) + (30*9) + (30 * 8) +......=<<30*10+30*9+...+30*(10-1)=1050>>1050 hours.Then you subtract the time that a horse comes (30 minutes), 10 seconds in between each horse(10 * 1050 / 10), then you subtract the time that the last horse left =(Time last horse left - time first horse came- time between horses).\nThen ((1050-(30*1)-(10*.1(1050))=<<(1050)-(30*1)-1/10(1050)=5140>>5140 hours.That means that the last horse will leave the race at 5:14 and the race lasts 10 hours.\n#### 6:14\nAnswer: 6:14 AM\n\n### Input\nA father and son are working on a puzzle.

But back then, it was called \u201cspiritus mundi,\u201d which translates to \u201cspirit of the world.\u201d Before the 20th century, there were no treatment options for mumps. So in 1967, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommended the MMR vaccine for everyone in the United States. The MMR vaccine prevents mumps and 2 other serious childhood diseases. After the mumps vaccine was introduced, most people in the United States who have mumps are now adults. This means they have never had the mumps vaccination, also known as \u201cmumps vaccine-associated immunity,\u201d or MVAI. Without the high level of MVAI, older people are much more likely to get sick with mumps if they contact someone with the disease. Mumps symptoms do not typically cause serious long-term problems. But mumps can cause a mumps swelling called \u201corchitis.\u201d Swollen testicles are one possible complication. In very rare cases, orchitis can lead to meningitis or even death. \n\nChickenpox \u2013\n\nChickenpocks is commonly contracted when an unvaccinated person comes into contact with someone who is sick with the disease. Once someone gets exposed to the virus, they can develop the symptoms of chickenpocks within 14 days.

However, since this question can be modified as follows, \"In what ways does divorce affect everyone other than a spouse?\", then the question can be asked with an Oxford comma, \"What is a negative effect of divorce?\".\n\n### Answer:B\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer: D\n\n### Demostration:\nRationales: In general, when you are working with exponents, you can subtract the exponents like regular numbers without having to rewrite anything. Then, when the exponents are equal, you will be left with a whole number that is the product; when they are not equal, you will have the quotient. For example, 3^2 - 2^2 can be simplified to 6.\nSince this question is asking about the difference of the exponents, we can use the same rules of exponents to simplify it. We start by separating 3, 4, 5 into the exponents 3**2, 4**2, and 5**2. Then, simplify those values by subtracting the exponents. Therefore, you will get 32 - (22 + 12) = 512 - 312 + 12 =6 * 7 * 8 = 364 - 256 + 12 = 112 This simplified to 112 = 12 (answer).  \n#### 12\nAnswer: 12", "answer": "E: children suffer"}

The same argument can be made for C, where you could say that many villages can be found in a big city; however, only if there is more space can villages be built on the outskirts of the big city.\n\n### Input B\nIn what area is it likely to contain a large town?\nAnswer: A\n\nA is the likely answer choice because it is where the villages are most likely to be found, they are more likely to be found in rural villages as opposed to urban villages.\n\n### A\nInput: In what area is it likely that a village is located?\nAnswer: E\n\nE is the likely answer choice from a practical sense since it is the area where the majority of villages are found; thus, if you wish to locate a village, it is probably more likely you would find one in the countryside.\n\n### Choices\n\n#### Choice:D\nRationale: Choice:D is the only answer choice that uses the plasve verb form in the sentence.

Which grade is the smallest?\n\n### Rantalies:If there are 37 students total and each grade has students, then there are 37/x students in grade x. Since all the grades have the same number of students, then their number of students must be a ratio of x to each other. So for example grade 3 has students so 37/3 = <<37/3=12>>1\nSo 4 = 37/x\nSo 37/37 = <<37/54>1/54\nSo x = 3/5\nSo x = <<1/54>1\n### Input E $12\n\n### Instracion:The number of students in every grade is a ratio of x where x =", "answer": "E: may die"}

Washing machines are a good investment because they do multiple uses.\n\nC: Most clothing stores require payment and are located in shopping malls. If you go to a local, small, or a large retail store that requires payment of socks and jeans you would have to provide payment to the employees of the clothing store. You do not just walk up to a clothing store and demand socks and jeans on your own. The store would not honor it.

{"text": "The correct response, D, should be chosen because people may unwittingly spread the disease through contact with patients or items brought there from unknown contaminated areas.\n\n### Analysis: The ghost town choice is unrelated to the question. Second-world countries are places where there are severe economic, cultural, and social problems; however, they can still be free of disease. We are not concerned with economic and cultural conditions when we are talking about disease; the issue is whether or not there exists a disease that a specific place is particularly susceptible to. Human bodies can also not be labeled as third-world countries and their presence shouldn't be the cause of its spread either. This answer is therefore incorrect. As for the rug E, rugs are made from fabric, which is not susceptible to disease. The hospital E choice is also incorrect as the disease is not restricted to only one particular place.\n\n#### Reasons: Choice D: We are specifically focused on disease; while economics and culture have to do with sociology, disease is a medical, not sociological, problem.\n\n### Input 2: Where is disease often spread but shouldnt be? Choices A: the library B: a hospital C: in an empty gym D: my dog's kennel\n\n### Response 2: The correct response, A, should be chosen because the library is a place where you may interact with other patrons who may be suffering from some kind of communicable disease.\n\n### Analyisis 2: As for the gym C, there may be people who share equipment and the bacteria and illnesses that they may have may spread to others. This answer is incorrect. Since the dog's kennell D is not a community where interaction is encouraged, and it does not fall under the second choice, B, it is also incorrect because it does not cause the disease to spread. The library A choice, however, does show that there are places where diseases can be spread.\n\n#### Reason 2: Choice A: We are specifically looking for places where people are exposed to other people and possible disease; the library is, therefore, an acceptable answer choice.", "answer": "E: hospital"}

Choices: a) look attractive b) feel pleasure c) look pleasant d) be interesting e) feel attractive\n\nOutput: Choices: a) feel attractive b) look pleasant c) have fun d) look pleasant e) feel attractive)\n\n#### A: Look Pleasant)\n\nThis may not look attractive. This may not feel attractive either, but if it does, then that's good. I mean, sure everyone wants to look attractive, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to do that, especially if it won't make you happy either because you'll only feel attractive if you're happy. I think it would be better to be interesting first then feel attractive. If you look good, people will compliment you. But if you try to make yourself look good, your face might not be as happy.\n\n### Output on Instruction:\n\n#### A: Feel Pleasant)\n\nYes, I would definitely choose this answer. You have to feel pretty good about how you look if someone compliments you. I am a big fan of having fun, but I can't really say that I have too much experience with feeling attractive.\n\n### B: Feel Attractive)\n\nNo, looking pleasant would be better. You don't feel as good if you look nice and people are complementing you, then you look pretty bad and suddenly your face is not as happy. Just look pretty and you will be pleased and happy.\n\n## B: Feel Pleasant\n\nNo, looking at things in a different way would be interesting. Also, looking attractive should have some sort of effect on people's perception of you. People might compliment you, but they might also think that you are too conceited and arrogant.\n\n## A: Feel Attractve", "answer": "B: look attractive"}

Kieran does not want to speed, so she decides to go 45 mph for the first half of her trip and then slow down when she sees signs warning drivers to do so. How long will it take Kieran to get to her destination?\nRationales If she gets off at 7:00, if she is driving at a constant speed throughout her trip, then her duration will be 11:02 - 7 = << 11-7=4>>4 hours and 2 minutes.\n\n#### 4\nAnswer: 4\n\nInput: Diana, who is 90, is in a nursing home and is going on a cruise. She does not know for how long the cruise will last but her doctor said that she would be able to do the trip provided that her speed would not exceed less than 0.25 miles per second of acceleration. How fast can the ship go in mph so that Diana can be safely accommodated?\nRationales We know that acceleration is speed minus velocity to the first power.\nTherefore, acceleration is the change in speed per unit of time, where the unit of time is the same as the unit of the speed.\nAcceleration = 0.25 * (0) = << 0.25*0=0>>0 mph/sec2\nAcceleration = (0.25) ^ (-1) = <<(0.25) -1=0.00500>>0.005 mph/sec2,\nSince acceleration is less than 0.005.

{"text": "The answer is D: canada\n\n### Explanation:Climate in Toronto, Canada includes annual snowfall and seasonal precipitation. Average annual snowfall is 131 cm. In the months of March through May, average monthly precipitation is 9.8 cm. In late August through the first week of September, the precipitation doubles to 19.6 cm. Toronto is known to always have some form of snow on the ground because the high amount of snowfall from the winters to the low summer temperature do not allow the snow to melt. The Canadian Rockies to the west and the U.S.A. to the south will bring snow to Toronto even during summer seasons. Due to its geographic location, snow will inevitably occur. Snow occurs even in other cities in the northern part of North America with similar conditions. The surface of the earth itself has snow covering it because it is in the Arctic Circle.\n\n### Input;There is the 60/40 rule which says that you should never leave home without a tie and a jacket. The 60/4 rule states that for every 40 miles, drivers may safely exceed the speed limit by at least 5 mph, but not more than 10. If a driver knows that the posted speed limit is 60 mph, how much speed may he safely drive at if he needs to drive at least 80 mph, and not more than 120 mph?\n\n### Response;The answer is B: 140 mph\n\n### Explantion: Since the speed limit in place is 60 m/h, he may drive at least 40 miles without a violating and at most 60 miles. Dividing 60 by 40, we get 1.5 m/h, but we cannot drive that long because that is impossible. We cannot drive more than 60 m/hr and we cannot drive 80 m/hr. In a situation like this, with a fixed speed limit, we may increase our speed by 5 m/hr for each 40 miles, but the 5-mph rule goes up by 10 m/hr for each mile, so he cannot drive more than 15 m/hr or less than 20 m/hr.

In answer choice A: deadly, deadly means causing death as a result of some type of injury or disease, so the correct answer is going to be F.\n\n### B is wrong, because danger isn't a synonym of being deadly. So option B is Dangerous, which isn't used in the sentence.\n\n### C is wrong, because the sentence talks about the road being snowy and icy, which are definitely not things that the driver can or should be unconcerned about. Option C is unconcerned, which indicates that the driver feels like everything is OK, which contradicts the sentence.\n\nAfter that, the question comes down to: is this situation stressful? The driver will experience stress if they go too fast or are too tired.

Both choices tell you that the driver is going to be experiencing stress. To eliminate choice B, you need to think about the phrase \"too fast.\" This means that option B is stressful because the driver is going too fast. Option D is unconcern, which means that the driver feels that everything is OK, so they won't experience stress. However, if they are going too fast they will definitely experience stress when they see that they will go off the road, unless they are already driving too fast on a very slippery road.

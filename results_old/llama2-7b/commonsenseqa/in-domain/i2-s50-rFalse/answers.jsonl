Cities and Towns\n\n\nCities and towns are different. If we think of the world like a planet, we can imagine that a city is like the capital of the Earth.\n\nTokyo is the capital of Japan. It's the capital of the entire nation.\n\nCities are home for the most of the worlds population.\n\nThe only place with more people is the earth itself, which contains a larger population than all cities together.\n\n\n### Demostration\nInput:What is the capital of Italy?

Choices: A.moving up B. moving in C. moving to D. moving away E. moving out\n\n# B. Sports\nBecause sports include many of types of activities, we are going to use an activity description to help narrow down our selections.\n\nFor example, a description of an ice skating rink: A building inside which people ice skate.\n\nIf we ask What country has lots of ice skating rinks, and ice skating is clearly described we can choose a single answer, not multiple ones.\n\nAnd when you pick an answer you must know if the ice rink can be inside a city or outside a city.\n\n### How does a country have ice skating rinks?\n*Inside the town / city*\n*Outside the town / city *\n\n### Demos\n\nInput:What country has lots of ice rinks?

Why did you choose that?\n\n#### I selected A for the first question\nThe word 'nature' is present in the sentence. A park and a park both contain 'nature'.

The main metric used to evaluate machine learning model is accuracy (how good is your model at predicting the label correctly). To find the average model accuracy, you can use the formula below:\n\n$$Average Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN)$$\n\n- TP: True Positives\n- FP: False Positives\n- TN: True Negatives\n- FN: False Negatives.\n\nLet us suppose our TP, TN, FP, and FN are as follows:\n\n```\nTP = 1  \nTN = 3  \nFP = 2  \nFN = 5  \n```\n\nThen, \n\n$$Average\\ Accuracy = (1 + 3) / (1 + 2 + 5 + 3)$$\n$$Average\\ ACCURACY = (1 + 1) / (1 +2 + 5 +3)$$\n$$AVERAGE\\ ACCURACYYY = \\frac{3+4}{4+8+12+7}= \\frac{7}{13} = 0.54$$\n\n### Why do I need to train a neural network in practice?

The choices are movies, universities, parks and Alaska (the place in America which seems to consist of mostly trees). In order to be in nature, you would need to go to the park choice.\n\nThe second question was also answered correctly. A player would go to the penalty box if a foul was committed during the game and would have to stay there for a while to \"serve out the penalty.\" Since boxing is a sport, that's the game being played.\n\nIn regards to the question about John's RV, you would need \"electricity\" to have access to things that require electricity.

This made the beaver go to the penalty box and face a penalty. What sport were they playing? Choices A: sporting event. B: time race C. Penalty box D: football game E: hockey game.\n\nAnswer: E: In hockey, penalties may be called for a variety of violations, the most serious of which is a deliberate strike against an opponent. It is, however, uncommon for a referee to use the word \"foul.\" The more common designation is \"penalty\" (usually \"minor\" or \"major\"), and the corresponding box the offending player spends (and the player is sent off) is sometimes called the \"sin bin.\"\n\nIn the old National Hockey League there was a practice of a team to play \"shorthanded\" when an opponent was shorthanded (although at the time it was referred to as \"playing five-on-four\"), thus giving their power-play unit a numerical advantage.\n\nThe sin bin refers to a player who receives a major penalty. The player is sent off to the penalty box for a period of time and the team is shorthanded.\n\nThe goaltender is also sent to the penalty box for one minute per penalty minute the opposition's penalty. If the player has served his time and is still in the penalty box when they return to the ice, the goaltender enters a different penalty box next to their side of the penalty bench.\n\n---\n\nInput: What city are you proud to live in?\nAnswer: Denver\n\n### Instruct:\n\nInput: Which of these animals live in water?

{"text": "Input: The referee called foul when one player hit another. The player went to the box. What game are playing? Choices:A: Football game\n\n### Output:\n\n### Your Solution:\n\n### Comments\n\n# Reflection 2\nAbove is the second part of the project.\nIn this project, I created a function that finds the largest number in an array. This function takes in an array and prints the largest number.\n```javascript\nlet test = [6, 8, 5, 3, 2, 5]\nfindLargestNumber(test)\n```\nThe function takes in an array of integers and returns a function with a parameter that is the largest number. The function then creates an empty array outside of the parameter and returns the index of the number, then prints it. All of the functions print their parameters using console.log and the index using the `.indexOf`.\n\nThe most tricky part of this project consisted of getting the function to not accept numbers that aren't in the array as an arbitrary integer. It was very important that only a number in the array could make a match to the parameter, no other match would make it to an output.\n\nThe first iteration of the assignment didn't have to return a function, which makes it much easier for beginner programmers, allowing them to focus on learning and the function. This project, although made much easier, is more challenging then the first iteration because I know more than I did about for each loops and function as a variable. Over the course of the project, I understand more about how they work, why they work, and how the syntax is supposed to be set.\n\nAfter getting through this project, I know more about how for each loops work, and I know that I need to focus on functions instead of using them as variables. I understand more about how a function can take different variables and return just one. For example, if you were to console.log out all the variables in the array, there would be six different values printed, but when using a function, only one is returned.\n\n# Reflection\nAbove is another project I have completed.\nIn this project I learned more about functions as variables. This project was easier than the last one, which gave me more time to focus on the different functions I could apply to it.\n\nThis project took the array and added it to a blank", "answer": "A: sum"}

Output comes from the command line.\n\n### Execution Expectations\n\nApart from a main entry point into the project, all methods should be\nfunctional and should not require a REPL, command-line arguments, or any other\nuser-initiated input in order to run.\n\n### Input Arguments\n\nAll command-line argument input goes through the argument parsing function,\n`commandLineArguments()`. All arguments are treated as strings that come in as\na single argument. The only exception is the `inputFilePath()`,\n`inputFilePath_1()` method which accepts input as file\npaths and is implemented in a way that the first parameter given to this\nmethod is actually a file path. You do not need to write a file path parsing\nmethod, but you do have to check for and handle when a file path is invalid.\n\n### Data File Input\n\nData files are the only type of input that is not treated as one argument.\nFile handling is written as such (`inputFile_path_reader()`):\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nclass JsonFileInput\n\n    def __init__(self, input_file_path, data_file_path, is_json=True):\n        self.input_file_reader = open(input_file_path, 'r')\n        self.input = self.input_fileReader()\n        if is_json:\n            self.data = json.loads(self.input)\n            if (self.data == None):\n                print('Could not open or load data')\n                self.", "answer": "D: canada"}

{"text": "You can complete all three of the above tasks for your practice by using Python. You\u2019ll use the following files:\n\n1. **difference-maker.txt**: This will hold the two lists we want to test. This will hold names and ranks and how many votes they received.\n2. **difference-votes.txt**: This file is used for printing the results.  This will be the same as your choice.votes.txt file, except that the name that was chosen will be used as the answer.\n3. **difference.py**: This is the program that you will write to answer the three multiple choice questions.\n\n### Tips and Tricks:\n\nHere are a few suggestions for making the program more efficient since speed and computational time are important for this Challenge.\n\n- You can use the zip function in Python to combine lists in one single list called difference.  It would be best to use zip since we don\u2019t care about the order in which names appear in the difference-maker.txt file. A better and more efficient way is looping through the two lists and comparing the names.\n\n- This could also be done with a dictionary where the list is the key.\n- Also, since it is a list of lists, you could also use pop() to return the last item of each list.\n- You could also combine lists to create a list of votes by using a for loop, since we know who voted for who. However the zip function could also be called in this case. See the zip explanation above.\n- You could create a dict of all the people who did not vote to put in your list.  This would be better and more efficient than comparing list-by-list in a loop.\n- Also, you can use the built in methods for inputting and printing to make an efficient program.\n- Using input() to take the names as input helps since it would be faster than using a for loop and a list while accessing elements.\n- For the answers, it would be easier to have the print statement already set up.  Then, when the answer variable changes, you would print the correct answer.  Then, you would add your print statement to print \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d depending whether the names of the candidate are the same.\n\n### Challenge Description\n\n\n- Use difference.py to solve below problem using the following conditions:", "answer": "C: snoring"}

{"text": "*C: Museum*\n\n### Extended Response:\nSometimes, it's hard to tell the difference between a zoo and a museum, but there are some distinct differences. In a museum, animals are displayed in cages or tanks. However, in a zoo, animals roam freely throughout a park-like setting. A zoo is primarily educational, and a museum's purpose is to show off and display beautiful objects. Also, in order to preserve the animals, there are regulations on the number of individuals in a cage, and the zoo will house an animal only if it meets those criteria. In a museum, there are no limitations on the number or species of animals displayed. Additionally, there may be more than one zoo in a city so they can have more animals, but museums can only have one in their city. However, this is not the case everywhere, and a city may have more than one zoo. Museums also sometimes house animals that aren't very common, such as polar bears or penguins. Zoos on the other hand, generally don't have polar bears, but they do usually have penguins. Zoologists are usually called to a zoo to study the animals to help improve their care. Museums don't allow these types of professionals in. While both zoos and museums are great at preserving animals, zoos usually have more money to invest in their animals' care than museums do. Additionally, zoos are required to follow the guidelines set out by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Museums don't have to follow any regulations.", "answer": "A: zoo"}

They were tasked with leading the world to Jesus and sharing the good news. At that time, it was very dangerous and even life threatening. Jesus spoke about this in Matthew 10,\u201cdo not be afraid of them. For there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.

And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don\u2019t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.\u201d So Jesus gave them the command to share the Good News about him.

The methods in class Human were used to create objects that are humans. Those methods included using the attributes in Human, as well as the properties and functions within the human. The other classes were used to create objects of their own, but they also relied on methods within the Human class. This challenge has led me to be able to understand not only the function of each class and how it was used in its' given situations, but also how each class had properties of how it functioned. It has shown me that the object of the class (variable) is made out of its own properties and functions and they can also have properties (attributes) that describe that class.", "answer": "E: elevator"}

The simplest solution is to just do a `nextLine()` and loop through the lines looking for 'new jersey','scotland', and 'europe'.  Then write out the matching output.    (You can't do anything with `input.toLowerCase()` because you cannot edit an object in place.  To lower case the value you have to replace it.)\n\nComment: I saw these examples and was figuring how to change it to be able to ask more than one question. I guess I could just ask it once\n\nComment: You could loop through one line at a time looking for the one that matches and once done loop through the next one.  Or `scanln()` on them all at once and if one matches you can exit the loop early.   This would be an example of what I would do if I wanted.

{"text": "I had so much fun doing this challenge and getting the hang of these tasks. Below is my completed solution. Thank you. This was really fun.\n\n### Explanation:\nI used a randomizer to get three random options from each question. I did this by running getString([0]);\nNext, I used the random number generator and the length of the array to get the order of the array. I did this by looping through the array and assigning random numbers to the array. I used the randomization method of the array. Once the array is set I will display on the console as shown below.\n\nFor the first question, I simply used 'display' as shown. The rest of the questions were handled almost exactly the same, but I decided to save the data as an array, which can be accessed from the start of each prompt. This is one way to save data, but it is not necessarily the best approach to solving these types of problems. By storing the data in a list, you have to first determine if the item to be retrieved is in the list, and then determine where to find it. You also have to determine, if the item to be saved into the list exists. When saving and recalling data from multiple objects, such as the prompts, these two problems are avoided. Below is a small example of a solution that utilizes this approach.\n\n### Sample Solution:\n\n### Code:\n```\n\n### Output Example:\n\n### Challenge: Write a JavaScript function that simulates rolling a die (a die with 6 sides, one through six). Write a function that takes a number of dice rolls as a parameter to your function. Call your function \u201crollDice\u201d. RollDice rolls the die as many times as the number of times you put as a parameter.\n\n### Example\n```\n\n## Rolling A Dice\n\n## Demonstration Output:\n\n## Code:\n\n```\n```\n\n## Dice Roller\n\nThis function takes in and parameters a value for numRolls and number of sides on die. You will roll numRolls number of times.\n\n## Output\n\n### Challenge Expectation\n\nThe code was intended to run as is with the number 21 added to the sum. However, when I ran the code, I received an error for'sum' which was undefined.", "answer": "A: mouth"}

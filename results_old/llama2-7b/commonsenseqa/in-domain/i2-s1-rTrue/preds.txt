Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Google Maps and other highway and street GPS services have replaced what? Choices:  A: united states B: mexico C: countryside D: atlas E: oceans<n><n>### Response:		 A: untied States<n><n><n>### Input<n><n><blockquote> <dl> <dt>What would the ocean do if someone took too many baths?</dt> <dd>Answer: It would try to recover.</dd> </dl> </blockquote><n><n>---<n><n>### Rationale<n><n><blockquote> 1. Taking a bath means going in the water. If someone goes in a place too many times he/she would probably cause some problems. This is the same concept as taking a bath in the ocean which would not be good for its health. If someone takes too many baths in water it surely would harm it. </blockquote><n><blockquote> 2. If somebody takes too many baths he may cause damage to the object which he/she is using for taking baths. Damaging an object by using it would be considered as stealing. </blockquote><n>---<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: carpet B: refrigerator C: breadbox D: fridge E: coach<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. The question is saying to us that the left over food in the kitchen has gone old and has become covered in mold. <n>2. While, A: carpet and C: breadbox could contain leftover food, neither would be likely to have been left to turn old and possibly forgotten. <n>3. B: refrigerators and D: fridge are the most likely places to store leftover food that would become old and forgotten. <n>4. However, B: refrigerating the leftovers may help prevent their spoiling, but, it wouldn't explain why they got covered in mold.<n>5. So E: coach sounds like the best possible answer. If the left over food was found in a coach, it would most likely have been forgotten and left to turn old. <n>6. The choice is a noun rather than a verb, which doesn't make sense. <n>7. E: coach is also more generic than the other choice and could have been referred to as a "container" rather than its specific definition. <n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: coach.<n>Answer: E: coach<n><n>Input: What can someone tell you that an apple might not be able to? Choices:  G: what kind of fruit it is  B: if it is organic  A: how many calories the fruit has C: how much it weighs D: what its color is E: if it is ripe or not<n>Rationales:1. Apples don't typically tell you what kind of fruit they are. <n>2. Apples don' t typically confirm whether they are organic, but apples might tell you if they are ripe.<n>3. Apples don' tell you how many calories they have, how much they weigh, or what their color is or if the apple is ripe. <n>4. This leaves you with the choices G: what kind of food it is and A: how many calorie has. Both of these are the best choices as they apply to all foods, not just apples.<n>5. G: what kind of vegetable it is is a good answer option. <n>6. However, the question does not specifically require a vegetable to be the type of food in the question which renders this answer option irrelevant to answering the question.<n>7. A

Choices:  A: car B: fuel system C: accelerate D: boat E: airplane<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Demolishment explanation:<n><n>1. The question mentioned that an accelerator was controller via hand throttle, meaning that the throttle was operated by the driver's hands.<n>2. The question mentions foot pedals and their use in controlling the steering suggests that the driver used their feet to operate these pedals. Therefore it is incorrect to say control.<n>3. The question describes the controller used with the hand throttle as a hand throttle. It also mentions the foot pedals used to control the steering. So the thing could be a vehicle. <n>4. The question seems to be concerned with the level of a vehicle, so it is unlikely that a pedal or accelerator would be operated via the hand, so it likely was controller via hand.<n>5. The correct answer is therefore E: airplane. An airplane, as well as having hand throttles and foot pedals, can also use an accelerator, which is not present in a car.<n><n>### Input :A device that controls the throttle position, while the throttle itself is controlled via a foot pedal located below the instrument panel. Choices:  A : airplane B: boat C: car D: fuel E: engine<n><n>### Response :<n><n>### Demostration explanation:<n><n>1: The question says that a foot pedal operated the throttle position while the throttle was controlled via hand. It also talks about pedals and their use for steering. This suggests that, in the questioned device, the driver would operate and steer using their feet and control the throttle via a hand. Therefore, we can reject options A: airplane as it controls throttle via a foot pedal. Option B: boat contains both foot pedal for steering and throttle control as required. Therefore, option B: boat is not correct as well.<n>2: In accordance with the question's instruction, the device is a car. It is not a boat nor an airplane, since it contains both foot pedals and throttle control.<n>3: Option C: car has both foot pedals and hand steering. This would meet the requirements of the question. Therefore, the correct answer is C: car.<n><n>## #4:<n><n>### Instructions:What does a hand throttle operate?

Choices:  A: ditch B: shop C: north america D: pet shops E: outdoors<n><n>### Response:		What's the logic?<n><n>### Input for #2:Too many people in California want to sell houses.  Which choice illustrates an extreme situation? Choices: 1. A: you don't need to sell 2. B: the only way you can sell is to make your 3. C: the price you sell at D: it's impossible to sell because 4. E: they try to get rid of it all on eBay<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>When it comes to selling a house, the basic law of supply and demand is that the more supply there is, the less demand you will get. If this law of supply and demand was the only factor affecting the value of your house, this would mean that the value of your house would go down (you can look up this formula for free on the web), but in reality, the value of a house is a bit more complicated. In that case, option 2: B: the only way to sell is at a huge loss.<n><n>If a person had a house with a market value of $300k, they were willing to sale as is for a price of $200k and would take whatever they got, then they would have a $100k loss. This would be the case if the house sat on the market for a few months or if a lot of people were trying to sell their houses. If a person could put 100k into fixing up their house, then they could make it more valuable, but even that wouldn't do it completely. If a house was in a neighborhood with 5 houses on it, and 3 of them were vacant, then it would be harder to sell the house because it would seem as though people were leaving the neighborhood completely. This is because people would be more concerned about their friends who owned other houses or people who worked there about the stability and popularity of the area. <n><n>When there's a supply of 5 houses with 2 on the market for sale, it seems like that it wouldn't be possible to sell, but a buyer could still try to get the one for the best price. If 4 houses are being sold, then only about one house will be sold per month. This would look better to somebody who has a house that is worth $300k and it took almost an entire year to sell it

This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3.

Choices:  A: headache B: understand themselves C: compliments D: own house E: happiness<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is option D: own house. A grumpy person is likely to have a negative outlook on life. This is because grumpiness is associated with negative emotions such as anger and irritability, which can lead to a lack of understanding towards others and oneself. Owning a house can have many positive aspects that can improve mental wellbeing, as it provides stability and a sense of security. Owning a home can give people a sense of pride and accomplishment, and can help them to stay positive. This is further supported by the fact that owning a home is often viewed as a financial investment or accomplishment due to its long-term benefits such as increased asset value and stability.<n>

Choices:  A: making love B: feel good C: happyness D: wonderful thing E: cloud judgment<n><n>### Response:		In the context of this question, the word ‘sex’ is a euphemism for sexual intercourse. The question is asking us what sexual intercourse ‘often’ make happen in people, and what are the ‘often’, and not the ‘sometimes’. With this in mind, the correct answer could be one of three ways.<n><n>1. The ‘often’ may be referring to the frequency of intercourse, in that it occurs often or not that often. Therefore, we can assume that the reason people have sex is for the feeling of happiness it brings them.  If this feeling could occur from other things (e.g a hug, sharing an ice-cream with a friend, a massage…) then the question wouldn´t specify ‘sex’, it would simply say that ‘feeling good happens often in people’, however this isn’t the case. <n><n>2. Alternatively, the ‘often’ may refer to the nature of the outcome of intercourse. In the question “what does Sex often make happen”, the word ‘often’ is used and is followed by ‘happen’ which is in the present continuous because the outcome of sexual intercourse is not limited to one ‘thing’. Therefore, sex may be something that causes people to feel happy. <n><n>3. Another way Sex may satisfy our needs is if the word Sex is a metaphor for sex itself rather then the outcome of sex.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:He made another call, he did this all day hoping people would what well to his offer?

Choices:  A: stress B: nervousness C: smile D: being bored E: making new friends<n><n>### Response:		<n>**Choice A:** The answer is D. aloof describes someone who prefers to keep to themselves and tends to think of themselves as superior to others. This implies that they will not feel stress meeting new people, as it is not in line with their personality.<n><n>**Choice B:** The answer is not A. Self-important is not a negative trait and often accompanies the ability to communicate effectively, so B is not an applicable answer as it may not apply to aloof people.<n><n>**Choice C:** The answer is E. being bored describes the aloof feeling apathetic and detached. So, a feeling of being bored can only come from D, which is meeting new people, which is what this question is actually asking us about.<n><n>**Choice D:** Answer is A. We need to look at the meaning of aloof. The dictionary defines aloof as, “distant or detached, as in manner or in feeling.” So, to aloof people stress is not an emotion they would use to describe their feelings when meeting new people, because they would not be emotional when meeting new people.<n><n>**Answer**: D: Becoming bored because they are experiencing a new emotion.

Choices:  P: A pearl necklace B: Pink bow C: Gold necklace D: Necklace E: Jewelry F: Other<n>Rationales:<n>1. I think that we are given that a pearl necklaces is attached by something that is not pearls; I think it is more likely than not that it is some sort of cord or string to where it would attach to a shirt or blouse. There is too vague of an image to give away an exact location.<n>2. The pearl necklace would be attached to something. We are given that this item of jewelry is attached to something that is not actually part of the pearl necklace. Therefore, it is more likely that the pearl necklaced would be attached to a dress, shirt, or blouse than the actual necklace would be attached by itself to a person.<n>3. Since the question doesn't specify what exactly a "pearl necklace" is, I am thinking it is a string of pearls that is attached to something, not an individual pearl. A necklace is an entire piece of jewelry, not an individual pebble or pearl. Therefore, it is unlikely that the individual pearl would be attached to an item of jewlery, but instead, the necklace would be attached.<n>4. Necklace E: "jewelry" is too vague and makes me think there will be more than one item of jewelery attached at either end to this string of pearls.<n>5. There is not enough in this question for me to determine the plausibilty of an answer. I think that it would be more likely than not that a pearl string necklace would be attached and if that is so, I would say it's not pearls, but something else that is attached to a string or a string of pearl that is part of the

Choices:  A: no go B: unlikely C: unable D: cant do E: impossibility<n><n>### Response:		<n>In this situation the fat man is a person who refuses to accept that he is unable to do something. He complains about the fact that he cannot do the simplest activities that require no real physical strength, such as walking or reading a newspaper. According to the questions these examples, he should be unable to do them. It's the simple inactivity that the fat man is unable to do. The first two alternatives seem to be related to inactivity as well, however we can assume that the fat man could do both B: unlikely and D: cant do if he was in a good mood or physically more fit because they are still based on doing something (walking and doing exercises). However, the alternatives E: impossible and C: unable are more appropriate to respond to this question and indicate that he is indeed unable to do such simple tasks, notwithstanding the fact that it is not actually impossible.<n>The answer is thus D: cant do or E: impossible.<n><n>### Input:-You could always go to the doctor when you feel sick instead of taking aspirin and waiting for symptoms to develop. Would you rather treat the symptoms or do something about the cause? Choices: 1. A: do something about the cause 2. B: feel well 3. C: wait out the symptoms 4. D: wait for it to get worse 5. E: treat the symptoms <n><n><n>### Response:-<n><n>In the situation presented by the question above, you would never know if you were only treating the symptoms because you did not get the real cause of the symptoms. What a doctor does in the situation, it is to treat the symptoms and then get to the truth of the matter, in order to really know what is going on. In this situation, the cause is the thing that you want to prevent as much as possible, as that is what it will make you feel. However, you don't want to ignore the symptoms, as you could just end up making the symptoms worse without knowing what they really are. Therefore, the most important solution is A: do something about what the true cause of your illness is.<n>

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:You can hear testimony of how spirituality changes lives when you do what?

Choices: 1: an ant colony; 2: a nest; 3: a swarm; 4: a hive; 5: multiple colonies <n>Rationales:<n>1.“Hive” is not acceptable because it only applies specifically to bees.<n>2. "Hive” is not applicable as it refers to the location of the ants, not to the ants themselves.<n>3. Therefore, “nest” and “swarm” are not correct as they indicate the physical location of the ants.<n>4. This narrows the options to “a nest” (1) or “a swarm” (2), as the others don’t make sense in the context. <n>5. By definition, hives are home of bees. As an ant colony only consists of ants.

A: picnic B. friend's house C. dinner at the table D. space shuttle E. fairgrounds<n><n>As a general rule, it's important to give specifics about the food in order to be more precise. In this part of the test the questions are very straightforward, but still it is also necessary to demonstrate basic rules with examples and show precise information as much as possible.<n><n>The given information from the question is that they're going to the game together, he's not going to be hosting but wants to bring over some food and that the friend is going to bring some food as well.<n><n>A.

Choices:  A: shame B: arrest C: embarrassment D: go to jail E: tension<n><n>### Response:		<n>- 39. A: shame<n>- 41.  B: arrest<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1.  Answer to 39: The question asks that an individual committing perjury is likely to lead to something. This being that, perjury will likely lead to being arrested. We can conclude that the individual committing perjuriy will likely lead to an arrest because the person has intentionally lied in court with an aim to deceive the jury; therefore, lying to the police (the police investigating the case would be the arrest), and also that lying in court has the goal of deceiving the jury, is considered a criminal offence in terms of the Law of Perjury. <n>2. Answer to 41: We know that the perjuror is not likely to lead to shame because someone can feel shame for something without breaking the Law of Perjurers (the legal framework outlining the criminal offence involving the case whereby the perjuror should be punishable), therefore, we cannot assume that an individual who has committed perjury is likely lead to shame. We know that the person that committed perjury was unlikely to lead to go to jail because, although committing criminal offences related to perjor is what has occurred, there have not been consequences associated with a jail sentence being served. Therefore, perjor is unlikely to lead to someone committing criminal offences and being sentenced to jail.<n>3. The answer to 42 should be A because perjury is an example of committing criminal offences, however, this is not what the criminal offence is leading us to. We know that criminal offences lead us to an arrest, and this is to ensure that the law is adhered to. <n>

An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What might a kid do with his friend before going to play? Choices:  A: laugh B: sit C: being entertained D: math E: meet<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>1. If a kid is sitting down and doing math, he can't go play, because he's already being entertained.<n>2. If he is meeting someone, he is talking to that person.<n>3. If he is doing anything else, he is going to play.<n>4.  Therefore, a kid will probably go to play.

Choices:  B: inside of a building C: in a gym D: not a building E: on a roof<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The first and last choices don't make sense as an indoor soccer field can be covered in a building.<n>2. It's unlikely a soccer field would cover the world or the entire earth as there are many other places that can host a soccer stadium.<n>3. Since the soccer field in the question is outside, we can eliminate the inside of a building.

Choices:  A: tennessee B: inside joke C: grassy field D: the forrest E: england<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Rationales:<n>1. A: Grassy fields are likely not where a fox would be caught since, as the name implies, they are grassy plains and, most likely, would not contain any foxes.<n>2. Since foxes are animals that prefer to live close to humans, they would more likely be caught in the forest since this is where one can find the most variety of food as well as shelter from the surrounding environment.<n>3. In reference to your first sentence, I think that joke is referring to “inside jokes” that can’t be found by strangers (I.E: people that have entered the “in joke” and know what it is). So since your question is not specifying whether it’s referencing a physical or digital space; I’m inclined to go with answer choice C.<n>4. B: As I think of Tennessee, a state in America, it is not immediately where a fox would likely be caught since it is not known for having a wide range of wildlife, nor would it have many forests.<n>5. Since foxes are often animals that like to live close to humans (not sure where this comes from), they aren’t likely to be found in England since it is a vast place with many inhabitants (therefore, more humans).<n>Answer: D: Grassy field

A building can't be a dwarf or incomplete if it is constructed well either, since both of these concepts rely on the amount of space that something occupies or the lack of material to create something.<n>If something is constructed well, then it has not made something inconsequential or good if constructed well, because this would be an illogical interpretation of a sentence that says a massive building is not constructed well and the building could still be useful.<n>A.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:When people discover something new while chatting with friends, why are they likely to continue talking? Choices:  A: agreement B: to fill their time C: discomfort D: misunderstanding E: learning about<n><n>### Response:		When people discover something new while they are chatting with friends, they are likely to continue talking because they need to find out more about what they are discovering.<n><n>### Input<n>When people are about to leave the house, why aren't they always ready? Choices: a. because they are still getting dressed b. because they are using the bathroom c. because they have forgotten something d. because their friends are still coming E: because their boss asks them to take out the trash Question 3 <n>#### Answer:D<n>#### Rationale: They could use the restroom and forget.They could stop and go to their backyard<n><n>### Instructions:<n>When people are about ready to leave the house, they are not always ready because they forget something or their friends ask them to take out the garbage.<n><n>### The rationales are as follows:

Choices:  A: sleeping longer B: getting cold C: death and decay D: change of color E: stop breathing<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales:<n>I selected the response of answer B. The question is asking how Janet knew she was dying, so the answer must be something that directly indicates her death is approaching or taking place, such as the stopping of breathing. The other possible answer choices A: sleeping longer do not necessarily indicate the onset of death, but would normally be a result of death and are therefore not reasonable explanations.<n>The remaining answer choices are unlikely because they wouldn't be immediately associated with dying, nor could a person be performing them just before they die. For instance, changing color doesn't necessarily indicate the beginning of death, and changing color can be delayed or happen gradually. Additionally, death would only be associated with change of color if the person was previously alive and were dying. As Janet is already injured before she answers the question, change of color seems like an inappropriate explanation. <n>The response D: change of color is a logical possibility as it could indicate death, but Janet doesn't specify how she knew she was dying. This answer would indicate Janet was able to tell she was dying, but we don't know if this is necessarily the case.<n><n>Response:<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Rational:<n><n>I selected the response B. Here's a summary of my thinking behind my answer:<n>1. The question is saying that a plumber can't use a wrench in a sink when doing what, so we need to know the correct answer. <n>2. A wrench would have an opposing shape to the opening a sink has, so if used in a sink, a wrench would not be able to do its job and would be of little help. <n>3. If the question had stated "A plumbers cannot use a wrench in their work when they're doing what", it would have been difficult to answer because plumbers use wrenches during plumbing work, so they would not be using a wrench for anything else. The question here is therefore ambiguous enough to allow a plumber to use a wrench even though the question specifies they aren't doing the job they do in general. <n>4. We know this because options A, B, D, and E can't be the answer. An answer choice must be accurate enough to allow a possibility where plumbers use w

Where might she look for one? Choices:  A: house B: music shop C: studio D: storage E: closet<n><n>### Response:		<n>"Yes, you're definitely right. I was able to find my acoustic guitar in my closet right away. After that I went to try out some new bass guitars at the music shop, and it was a lot of fun playing them, though none of them would be loud enough to drown out the sound of your guitar. I've given up on trying to find one that I can live with."<n><n>### Discuss:<n>The response below, from a student who is unaware that the question asked where James intended to look for a guitar, should be criticized.

The choice of words in the question implies walking or running can be used but they are "incorrect." The only choice we have is to slide.<n> 3. Jumping, sliding, and falling are all physical actions.<n> 4. We also see that "going" to the next room is necessary, which is why option A: climb is incorrect because climbing is not an action that can be done to the next room.<n> 5. Options B: jump and E: fall are both action words, but they are not specific to the third floor.<n> 6. It is the only option that doesn't specify a specific level of building and so it's the only option where "down" means "more levels down from the third floor."<n> 7.

Choices:  A: drill B: committed murder most vile C: bargemaster D: learn E: understand<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: E: understand<n><n>Rationales:<n>1. The master of their craft needs to have understood the concept of their craft in order to be considered a master. <n>2. We need a noun to complete this statement and only an understand verb could be a noun (only A and B are verbs).<n>3. We don’t necessarily know what the master of their craft did with the craft because it could be something like becoming a doctor or learning something. <n>4. Master is the most specific choice, followed by understand, committed murder and bargemaster. <n>5. Committed murder and bargemasting are both specific, but committed murder is more specific and we know that it is a thing that someone can do and a thing that someone can be. <n><n>### Explanation<n><n>#### Example 1<n><n>```<n><!DOCTYPE html><n><html lang="en"><n><head><n>  <meta charset="UTF-8"><n>  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"><n>  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"><n>  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fontawesome/free@5.15.3/css/all.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-wcp4caBhvBT7ZHwZZFmXnE2xb7X10JZP2P4yMzWcwzD1JWg/99hVn6J8aXQm0ZY54H1eIc1dU4l" crossorigin="anonymous"><n>  <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css"><n>  <script src="main.js"></script><n></head><n><body><n>    <h1>A: Where is the most secure location on this island? <br><input style="resize:none;" type="text" placeholder="The answer is 1" /><br><n>    <button onclick="document.getElementById('input_answer').value = '1'">Enter 1</button></h1><n>      <p class="answer">1</p><n>      <h1>B

It is also important to read the whole question and understand its meaning, especially if someone is a non-native English speaker. In this case, the person can have a translator to be able to ensure what the instruction means and how it should be worded, because every word carries a different meaning, that sometimes can cause unnecessary misunderstanding. In the case of the first question, I thought it meant what type of plumbing? So, I took the answer A: Oil Refinery, because my reasoning was that an oil refinery, in most cases, has a lot of plumbing in it in order to be able to work right. And sometimes this oil refinery has drinkable water tanks that are used as well in some cases. <n><n>I got the answer right (A: Oil Refineries) but in this case, I could have read the question wrong and it would have caused me not to answer the question correctly. I think it is important for the person to understand what the instruction means and be able to apply it to the scenario and answer appropriately. In the second case, again I took the wrong answer E: momentum, because in that question, the person begins to work, and therefore the only answer according to the instruction in the question is option D: accomplish. I think it is essential to have a better understanding of the question and the scenario in order to be able know what the instruction asks, otherwise it may cause the person to not be able to answer correctly.

Choices:  A: russia B: at home C: hole D: field E: heaven<n><n>### Response:		A: russia<n><n>### Rationale:A lemur is a type of primate that is native to Madagascar. So, it's safe to assume it can be found in and around Madagascar. There are lemur species that live in other areas of Africa and in certain areas of Australia. However, the vast majority of lemur species can be found on Madagascar.<n><n>### Note:For multiple choice questions that ask for a single word answer, we know the answer can only be one of the options in the answer slots. <n><n>### For multiple choice questions that ask to select a multiple of words, the solution can actually be just one word, it's just that the answer slots contain a multiple of words.  <n><n>### For example: <n><n>### Input : What were you looking for an apple for? Choices:  a: apple b: candy c: fruit d: snacks e: dinner<n><n>### Response : A: apple<n><n>### Rationales:There are three things to note:    <n>1. What were you looking for indicates a type of looking that could involve multiple outcomes, such as shopping. <n>2. Therefore, it is logical to assume the answer is referring to a specific object.<n>3. Objects that exist in baskets, containers, or otherwise have specific names are the best option.<n>4. This indicates we need three words:  A Basket of Apples, A Container of Apples, or A Pile of Apples.<n>5. Therefore, the answer is A. An apple.<n><n>### Rules:<n><n>* For multiple choice questions and answers that only have one option, the option selected is always correct.

Choices:  A: top of home B: older houses C: victorian house D: own home E: material<n><n>### Response:		<n>In this case, the question is asking for an example of a type of home that could be used to support the information in the first sentence. We know that the historical items are in an attic so it would make sense that the home that the items are in be the top of the home, or at the very least be somewhere at the top.<n><n>The second sentence contains a description of what an attic might be like. If the attic is filled with historical items, we know the home in question must fit the first sentence for the question to make sense.<n><n>The answer should be the home that fits the description of the attic in the second sentence.<n><n>Option A: Top of home: This is the correct answer.

The question asks what the name of the large, green leaf is.<n>2. We know that this is a specific leaf, so it would be unlikely to be the name of many different leaves. <n>3. In addition, "leaf" often refers to a specific species, so it's only natural to assume the question is also asking for the specific name of that leaf species. <n>4. We also know that the leaf is green but not particularly shaped other than it's large size, so it is unlikely a shaped leaf would be the answer.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6.

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:To properly instruct children attending school you would need a great deal of what?

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where do kids play with a ball that is concrete? Choices:  A: street B: soccer field C: soccer game D: central park E: pool table<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A: Street<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>Input: Where do children play with a ball that contains concrete? Choices: A: street B: ball C: soccer field D: soccer game E: central park F: pool table<n>Rationales:<n>1. The question is referring to some concrete that is placed on the ball, not in the ball.<n>2. Option B: ball is incorrect as this indicates that the ball is made of concrete, which is unlikely.<n>3. Option C: soccer field can be eliminated, as the question is not asking for where children play soccer, but rather where children play with a ball containing concrete.<n>4. Option D: soccer game can only be used when referring to concrete in the ball.<n>5. Option E: central park cannot be used, as concrete is not mentioned in the options. <n>6. Option F: pool table also cannot be used, as the question is specifically asking for where children play with concrete balls.<n>7. Therefore, option A: street is the correct answer, as it contains concrete in the form of street signs.<n>Answer: A - Street

Choices:  A: botanical garden B: doctor's office C: in a sea D: public place E: arboretum<n><n>### Response:		C: in a sea <n><n>Rationales:1. Ficus is an adjective meaning ficus trees which are often referred to as rubber trees because their sap has been used to make rubber. If we take our clue from the use of the word ficus, we can assume the specific ficus in question is a type of ficus tree. <n>2. We can eliminate option A: botanical garden because it would not make sense for a botanical garden to have an actual ficus tree. A botanical garden is a place where plants are preserved and studied, not a place to find actual plants.<n>3. Option B: doctor's offices does not make sense because a doctor's office is certainly not a place where one can find a ficus, let alone a special ficus. <n>4. Option D: public place would not be a reasonable response because you are unlikely to come across a ficus tree in a public place, let alone a special one.<n>5. Option E: arboretums is not a possible response because arboretums are places that specialize in conservation of trees, and they certainly would not include ficus trees.<n>6. Option C: in a sea is the most reasonable response as this allows for the possibility of a special species of ficus tree being found in a body of water. This is because ficus trees naturally grow near water sources, so if a special ficus tree is available, it would be found in a sea or other body of water.<n><n>### Requirement: Answer at least two of the three response questions as outlined below or as suggested by the instruction. <n><n>### Instructions: If you think the instruction's request is incorrect, try to rephrase and answer as requested.<n>A: Write a sentence using the vocabulary from the passage.<n>B: Find a word that best fits the definitions from the passage.

Choices:  A: copy B: intelligent C: improved performance D: empowering E: have more knowledge<n><n>### Response:		I think the options for this question are as follows: <n>A: Copy: This is not a skill that is required to learn hard concepts. In fact, students tend to fail when they copy rather than apply what they know to difficult problems. <n>B: Intelligent: It’s true that you need to be intelligent in order to learn hard topics. However, intelligence should be defined as the capacity to learn rather than a trait that is already present. <n>C: Improved performance: Students should learn hard concepts by practicing and taking on the difficult problems they face in the class. This is how they become better performers, not because they have changed their level of intelligence. <n>D: Empowering: I don’t think the word “empowering” is appropriate here. The question is referring to whether or not knowledge of concepts is needed to learn complex ideas, there is no mention of empowering.<n>E: Having more knowledge: The answer to this question isn’t having more knowledge. It is having confidence in yourself as a student and your ability to handle complex concepts. Having extra knowledge on a concept or subject would be irrelevant so long as you understand the concept, you can use the knowledge effectively. <n>So of these five options, I think the correct answer is that “students learn concepts by practice” and not by improving their intelligence or empowering themselves in any way.   <n><n>Input:What is the largest piece of glass that you can form without getting your hands dirty?

Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

This would indicate that wearing shoes is unnecessary in a non-English speaking household, which is not the case. Therefore, the answer would be C: a person wears shoes when she enters an English-speaking household, so, to be polite to the English speaker, she does not need to wear it.<n><n>### Input <n>### In a person in an English-speaking environment wears _____ when he/she enters the house of a non-English-speaking native.<n>A: shoes B: clothes C: socks D: sandals E: a coat and hat<n><n>### Rationales <n>### The choices that are incorrect are A: shoes, B: clothes, D: sandals and E: a coat and coat. <n>### A: Shoes and D: Sandals mean the student must wear a pair of shoes or sandals when entering the house, however, this is not a polite thing to do. In an English speaking home, taking your shoes off and slipping on the carpet is common practice, so when you do not know the native language of a home, you should take your shoes off to be respectful. <n><n>### B: clothes is not applicable as you don't remove clothes when entering an English-speaking house. <n><n>## C: Socks are something you wear when it's cold outside, and this

Choices:  A: throw things B: play sports C: play games D: play ball E: play chess<n><n>### Response:		The parents were clearly thinking they were signing up their children to play ball.<n><n>### Rationale: From the question, we can see that the parents thought signing up their children indicates the children will be doing physical activities together, and playing ball suggests it's a sport. <n>7. Since we know it wasn't chess, that leaves us with three choices: B, C, and D. <n>8. Choices B: play sports and C: play games do not require any specialized equipment or facilities and are both activities typically done on a group basis. <n>9. These choices could certainly include playing ball, but in this case the children are playing ball, so this can be discounted. We know this because it would be unlikely for adults to sign their children up to play games without knowing the children already play them or were comfortable with playing one. <n>10. Therefore, the answer is D: play ball. <n><n>### Input<n>What does he have?<n>Choices:  A: a new watch B: a stolen watch C: his watch D: no watch E: a worn out watch<n><n>The question is asking what a watch this man has, implying a watch is a possession. <n><n>Since he is wearing a jacket, we can rule out the unlikely answer of "no watch", which would be the only way this statement could be true. <n><n>"His watch" is not a good response because it is not a complete sentence. The options on the list are a watch, so these cannot be a possessive case noun. <n><n>"his stolen watch" is incorrect since the watch is not stolen. "we need the watch" is also an incorrect answer. <n><n>"A new watch" is the most logical answer because it indicates that a new watch belongs to the man.

We know that the "he" referenced in the question is an electrician making some sort of mistake.<n>2. The options aren't in the proper sequence because they're not related to work or electricity at all. <n>3. Option A: work is not necessarily related to what the electrician will find when he touches the wire. <n>4. Option B: shocked could be a consequence, but again, it's not related to what the electricity will do or how the electrician is feeling. <n>5. Option C: humor sounds like something an electrician would mention when he wasn't feeling good. <n>6. Option D: startled and E: funny are feelings that we know the electrician may experience, but they're again not related to work, electricity, or what will happen when the electrician touches the wire.  <n>7.

A: a feather B: a bowling ball C: a pillow D: a rubber ball E: a rock<n>Rationales: The answer is E: a rubber because it is most likely to not hit your head or break easily. The feather however is most likely to mess up your hair. The rock will have the potential of breaking and hurting you. The ball will also have potential of hurting your head. The pillow will also hurt you if it's too sharp or if you drop it too hard or too fast. So the only option left is the rubber ball.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What could be happening near you if the ground is getting wet?

Choices: 1. By sucking blood from its host. 2. By staying on or in its host. 3. By biting its host. 4. By moving its body across a surface.<n>Rationales 1. "Jump" cannot be answered using the given choices. 2. A flea cannot stay on or in its host, since it cannot fit inside one. 3. A flea cannot bite its host, as a flea would not be in contact for either the duration or quantity needed to bite. 4. The final choice "to move its body across a surface" is a grammatical error which would need to be removed when editing, but it is the correct answer. <n><n>Input:How will a spider spin? Choices: 3. With a weaving instrument, 4. With silk, 5. With the aid of an invertebrate, 6. By itself.<n>Rationales:<n>**3. Weaving instrument** : A weaving instrument would be used to build a physical structure, which would not require any material to be used. Spider silk, however, is a thread used specifically for the spider's web, which would satisfy one of choice 4: **with silk**.<n><n>**4. With silk** : Although this is a perfectly legal answer, we are not provided with information that a spider typically spins its web with the aid of another invertebrate.

This allows for answers that either refer to the state of the sun and then something not being there, or the state of something being taken away and then a condition not being true, or a condition not being true and something not being there.<n><n>#### Answer :<n>The light is used to refer to a condition which has been removed, but we can also say a condition is removed. <n>Hence, option D: clouds or E: nothing would also be possible and valid answers.<n><n>### Input 2: How did the pond not have a sun as of late? Choices: <n>1. A: It was for that sun <n>2. B: That sun was from it <n>3. C: It was a sun of that sun <n>4. D: It was under that sun <n>5. E: That sun was a part of that pond  <n>Rationales : 1. The question refers to a sun that the pond has not seen in a long time  (ie it hasn't seen for a while). This suggests that it could be in the past, and therefore we are looking for an event that has happened in the past. <n><n>#### Answer 2:<n>A) does not relate to the sun not being there anymore so it is ineligible. <n>B) is a possibility, however the sentence doesn't actually indicate that it was the sun that was taken away, so we should not assume this.  <n>Choice C) would only be used if there were another sun present and could be used to explain a situation involving two suns. <n>D) it is referring to the pond, so if " that sun" is part of that,

Hot places are typically dry and so E: one's hot is wrong since it is saying one can travel to one's home.3. Options B: a theater and C: a show both could be seen as an entertainment venue that is boring or uninspiring. <n>4. However, both options require the presence of people, which may be necessary if you are looking for the type of place which is boring and dry due to lack of human interaction.<n>5. Therefore, the place should be considered boring due to lack of activity, so the answer is D: your country. A country, of course, lacks people in almost all of its places, aside from cities, so it can be considered a boring place that is dry.<n>Answer: D. Your country

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7.

This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

Choices:  A: factory B: garden C: supermarket D: garage E: warehouse<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is "E: warehouse."<n><n>1. The container is a "dime a dozen" because it was common; this also indicates the container is a large quantity. <n>2. A factory was not the correct choice: this would have been a place to manufacture the large containers. <n>3. There is no supermarket in the question: if they were "rows" as you'd need lots of them in a supermarket, then you would expect to find supermarkets throughout the factory, which is not what the question is saying. <n>4. The same logic applies to the other answers: nothing in the question mentions a garden, factory, or garage and there are other better choices. <n>5. The correct answer is "E" because there are plenty of warehouses that contain many dimes a dozen containers: supermarkets, shipping companies, etc.<n>Rationale:<n><n>### Input:(Refer to the input image)<n>There has never been a time in history when technology has not been changing.

Choices: 1 A: It is a good thing. 2 B: I want to be rich, too. 3 C: I don't think that's possible. 4 D: Me too. 5 E: Maybe.<n>Rationales: C. I don't think it is possible. This is the best response as it's the most honest option. Saying "it is a good thing" or "it is possible" isn't as honest because those things may or may not be true, and it would be kinder to the friend to say that it's not so they don't get a disillusioned feeling if they end up never becoming wealthy. <n>B. I want to be rich too. This isn't a good response because it assumes the wealth that the friend wants is even possible. Also, there's no need to encourage the friend to pursue wealth if they've already mentioned it as something unrealistic.<n>A. It's a good thing. Is not the best answer as it may or may not be truthful. <n>D. Me too. This isn'T the best response because the friend probably doesn't want anyone to tell them they think it's possible for the friend to become wealthy because it's still possible. <n>E. Maybe. This may be the honest response. <n>Answer: C: I don' t think that's possible<n><n>### Demostration<n><n>Input: The question asks for the best response to your friend saying they want to make a lot of money when they grow up. Choices: A: That's great.  B: You will.  C: It's a big dream.  D: I want to do the same.  E: I doubt it.<n>Rationales 1. The answers A, D, and E may be the most honest because they don't assume the wealth that the person wants is even possible, but they might dishearten the person if wealth isn't actually achievable, so perhaps they should say something a bit less aggressive, or maybe just say they believe the person will make it happen. <n>2

Choices:  A: drinking B: intimacy C: dancing D: happiness E: enjoyment<n><n>### Response:		What could you expect if you went to your house party? Choices:  Rationales: A: drinking 1. It is very probable that drinking will happen at a house party; it is a frequent part of celebratory events where the drinking of alcohol is accepted as an activity for enjoying oneself. <n>2. If you go to the house party, you can expect to find people drinking. B: intimacy 3. If there is alcohol being consumed, it is very likely that there is intimacy happening as well. Intimacy is very sensitive subject matter, and thus people typically do not reveal in public that they are intimate with other people. 4. It implies that people in the place are intimate and comfortable with each other, and not inhibited by the presence of others. 5. Thus, it is more comfortable to share intimate details with a romantic partner than with a stranger. C: dancing 6. This is because if there is alcohol, there will be dancing. They will be dancing to the music, to get closer to the people they are dancing with, to drink, and to enjoy themselves. D: happiness 7. Happiness is defined as "a feeling of pleasure and joy," and according to the OED, it is defined as "an individual having or showing an elevated degree of feelings of happiness; elated, cheerful (in mood or attitude), lively-happy.<n>8. This indicates that they are happy and enjoying themselves. They are probably enjoying themselves. 9. They probably are having a good time. E: enjoyment 10. If you went to the house party, it would be fun and enjoyable. You would like to go to that party. You might even have an enjoyable time if you go to the party. F: drinking 11. It is easy to find someone who enjoys drinking.<n><n>### Answer: What could you expect if you go to your house party?<n><n>You can expect that the people at the party will be: drinking, dancing, enjoying themselves and feeling happy.

Choices:  a: office c: mall b d e f g <n>### Rationales:<n>1.The question is trying to figure out the location of a specific device.<n>2.Both stairs & escalator require physical transportation which could be any part of the building where it is possible to transverse between floors without having to exert significant physical energy. Such devices include elevator, escalator, etc.<n>3.Both stairs and an eslator are means of transportation, not devices (such as clocks).<n>4.A suitcase, computer printer and large pieces of paper are devices<n>5.An artist's studio involves the creation of art, not a device.<n>6.An engineer's office (which, arguably, could involve the creation of art or devices), a courtroom, and a schoolbus all involve the presence of devices and require physical transportation.<n>7.Since the question is asking where in a building would one find a device with physical transportation (but not a specific device, like a staircase), one could consider the option of finding a device with physical transportion that is not a specific device (or an escalator is a device that could transport the owner up and down floors, but it is not the same as the physical transportation stairs).<n>8.Therefore, the correct answer is C: mall. In a shopping mall, there is an assortment of devices (elevator, escalator) as well as stairs (if there are more than one level in the mall or if there are multiple entrances to the mall).<n><n>### Response to Instructions:<n><n>### Multiple Choice Question:<n>Where could you find some plastic that does not come from a manufacturer? <n>Choices:  A B C.

Input: What is missing in the sentence? Choices: <n>### Demonstiration:<n>Input: A well known musician has a house built with 36 windows and 6 bedrooms. Which word would the missing? Choices:  "A" is missing _ B: house C: windows D: musician E: <n>### Rationales: 1. The sentence is talking about one thing that's missing in a sentence. <n>So, in order to provide the missing thing, we need to identify that thing by looking at what options it could possibly be referring to. <n>2. A: "a:" is the most logical answer, as the question is asking for one missing word, rather than multiple missing words. <n>3. The house has been built with windows and there are windows mentioned in the sentence's body, suggesting this is referring to the house and not the musician. <n>4. We can also conclude that "house" is not the missing word, since we've already been given an example in the sentence itself. <n>5. The sentence says the house has 36 windows and six beds, not that a person, a piece of music equipment, or anything else in the sentence contains windows or beds. <n>6. The sentence also says that the musician is well known, so this implies that the musician is not, in fact, a well-known bed, window, or house. <n>7. "B: House" is not the correct missing word either, because if we are referring to the house, the sentence would need to read "36 windows and six bedrooms and a house," which is not what we have. <n>8. "B: house" is also ineffective because referring to the house as "one word" does not make grammatical or logical sense. <n>9. So, it's most likely that the missing word is either related to a number of windows and houses or is related to the musical instrument that the musician is known for. <n>10. "B: house," however, does not contain either of these meanings. Thus, we can conclude the correct answer is: A: musician.<n>Answer: A musician.<n><n>### Input : In what way can a person who is a

Rational 2: The balls all started out in the same state of rest.<n>3. As James puts them back in use and he is bouncing the balls on the ground this is another indication that all are at the state of rest now.<n><n>1.

Choices:  A: outside B: vacation C: idle D: apartment E: neighborhood<n><n>### Response:		The answer is outside. <n><n>### Inputs:This person is saying he was happy within his comfort zone, which at home, was comfortable.  But he had a crippling phobia of getting outside. <n><n>#### The question:<n>The question is asking what phobia, or specific fear, the person had the most difficulty overcoming. <n>The option he doesn't have trouble leaving his comfort zone.  He does not have trouble leaving his home (A) and he does not have a phobia of idleness.  He also does not have a phoria of vacationing (C). <n>The answer is outside because that is truly what he does have a phobia about.  He had a great deal of stress, guilt, shame and anxiety about going outside of of his comfort zone. <n><n>## Task Analysis<n>There was some confusion about the choice of words.  But these seem to be choices of a very specific meaning.  Outside (B) is where a person typically experiences the most discomfort, fear of the unknown and stress. Idle (D) is not an activity, just the state of being, so it is not an option even if the person does have trouble idling. They would still not have trouble with going idle. The same is true for vacation (C).  I went through the options one by one, eliminating those where I could think of reasonable context that would apply.<n><n>I could be wrong about the specificity of these options.  But for this particular question, I believe it was specifically to see if it was the fear of going outside, or something else (maybe the fear of idle, or idle itself, but not going outside), and I believe the confusion with my answer came from my stating that it is the fear of going outside.  However, the question said the answer is outside, so, it would make sense then, that the fear itself is not in any way connected to outside.<n><n>The final example was much more clear cut.  To me, I believe the question was asking for the most obvious example of the person's phobia (having trouble accomplishing). <n><n>I used those two questions to show that the test questions are specific for what they ask.  Often, those questions won't be vague like that, but they also won't have answers as obvious as outside.  They will include

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:They launch a surprise attack, this ended the what? Choices:  A: surrender B: defence C: retreat D: cease fire E: defend<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is A: surrender, since the question is asking about an activity performed by the other side of the battle. A: surrender, since it ends any attempt to defend or cease any actions. Therefore surrender ends anything that is happening such as the war or the conflict.<n><n>### Input:"The enemy's actions are more effective" is an indication of what? Choices: A: being weak B: being strong C: being able to keep up D: being able to overcome E: being defeated<n><n>### Response:"The enemy's action is more effective" is an indicator of how strong or efficient the enemy's actions are. So, B is the correct answer, since the question is looking for actions that are efficient, strong or are more effective. The options C, D and E indicate inabilities to do these activities.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: nature B: toilet C: computer science D: computer store E: human body<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. C: a computer, not the science, should be what we're looking for.<n>2. It's hard to imagine a computer being used in a toilet or a human body or as the science, so they shouldn't be part of the answer. <n>3. A nature system doesn't have to be made out of electronic devices, so that also shouldn't be in our answer. Only a computer is actually used in electronic devices (though sometimes they're also used in nature systems). <n>4. That means we're looking for the school computer. <n>5. Even if there were multiple computers in one system (like in a computer lab), we know that this isn't the answer because the question asks where it is used.  <n><n>6. Therefore, the correct answer is D: computer store. <n><n>### Input:- Where is a car not found in? Choices: A: toilet B: car show C: car show D: gas station E: school<n>Rationales:<n>7. The question asked where a car is not found in.<n>8. A: toilet is where a car is found in.<n>9. C: car show, and D: gas station are not options, as no one visits these places to buy or get a car. <n>10. A: toilets is not an appropriate answer as it is a place of personal hygiene and not a car-related place, even if it contains some automobiles.<n>11. So the answer is B: car show.<n><n>### Input-Where can you find a person when they're not at a concert or on a trip?<n><n>### Response<n>1. We're looking for where a person is when they aren't at a concert or on the trip. <n>2. A: at the concert and B: on the trip are not applicable unless the question refers to a specific person or type of person. So they can be ignored<n>3. C: Concert and D: trip shouldn't be in the answer. <n><n>4. E: home may be used as a place when a person isn't at a concert, but it wouldn't be appropriate in an answer for this question. It's not mentioned in the question and is not relevant here.<n><n>5. Therefore, the answer is H: car

Choices:   A: cut board B: drill holes C: build a house D: place nails E: make wood more level F: finish carpentry work<n><n><n>### Response and Rationales:<n><n>### Your response will include at least two specific details. Rationales:<n>1. A: "The carpenter can fix the corner to prevent the shelf from collapsing and ensure its stability. The corner is the point at which the shelf attaches to the wall, where it is most likely to fail if it is showing any signs of instability. Correct!"<n>2.

Choices: A: hot dogs B: ketchup C: a fork D: spaghetti E: some extra spaghetti <n><n>### Demostration:<n>1. D: The carpenter will fix the shelf by ensuring the stability of the shelf. The carpentry work is done by attaching it to the wall properly, which involves ensuring a firm connection between the shelf and the wall while being careful not to damage either surface.<n>2. This means that the carpenter will be fixing the issue by making the shelf more stable by attaching it to a sturdy wall. Option B: Roof would not be necessary it as the shelf is already stable, and it has nothing to do with fixing the issue.<n>3. Option A: roof because roofs are usually fixed to the outside and cannot really be fixed within the interior of a dwelling. <n>4. Option C: is a whole building, which is much more of a structural problem, and not related to the shelf. <n>5. Option D: Wall, this is incorrect because a wall normally cannot be directly attached to a shelf. <n>6. Option  E: Cupboard is not really a reason for a fix because no fixing is needed for the cupboard, the shelf is already attached to the cup

It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:A projector displayed people on the huge screen while the audience laughed.  What might they be watching? Choices:  A: movies B: theatre C: cabaret D: conference E: meeting<n><n>### Response:		D: conference<n>* If they are watching a conference then the room itself has walls which contain a screen or are a screen themselves.<n><n>### Input<n>If it is a game, what kind of game? Choices: <n>A: baseball B: basketball C: football D: hockey E: tennis<n><n>### Response<n>E: tennis<n>* Tennis is a racket sport where players either use bats or racquets. Therefore, it is unlikely that a game that involves a bat or racquet could be a game based on football, baseball, hockey, or basketball.<n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.

Choices:  A: city B: toronto C: radio station D: roger that E: medieval castle<n><n>### Response:		B: toronto<n><n>### Response rationale: 1. The "tower in the shape of a human body" is a reference to the CN Tower in Toronto. This is visible from great distances and used to transmit radio signals between Toronto and the province of Quebec. <n>2. There are many other "towers" in different names, such as Chicago or other cities that may be mentioned in passing without providing a name. <n>3. As the question asks what business has a tower to broadcast signals, it makes more sense to answer the question with the name of a business that has a tower to broadcast in a location that is recognizable for its name. <n>4. City and medieval castle are not relevant to the question at hand.<n><n>-------------------<n>### Input:I am having a problem with my computer. What is there to me?

Choices:  A: tide pool B: beach sand C: tidepools D: current E: cooking pot<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales:<n>1. A: tide pool <n>The answer is a tide pool because it's stated that the crab is scuttling, but he is strained. When one is strained, it means that they're tiring or exerting extra effort, which is not typically associated with a crab. There is no obvious constraint on a crab in the form of a rock, but a tide pool does limit a crab. This means if the tide pools are shallower that there is only enough space for a few crabs to move freely around them, so they have to move very quickly and carefully to avoid any dangers.<n>For example, I can be strained when carrying a heavy load up a steep hill so it's harder for me to move.<n><n>2. B: beach sand <n>The answer is beach sand because a beach is a large body of sand covering the area between the water’s edge and the high tide line. This answer is given by the second paragraph.<n><n>3. C: tidepoils <n>This is not the answer because the question asks 'impeding him' which means hindering or preventing progress.<n><n>4. D: current <n>This is not giving the correct answer because: <n><n>The question asks about a "different body part for that part of the question you've read, and then make an incorrect but logical assumption-based deduction about that piece of the problem.<n>It only tells about the crab, it does not say whether the crab is moving or not.<n><n><n>5. E: cooking pot <n>It is not the answer because 'impeding him' means that he is preventing the crab to move forward. In the same story, we can find out that the crab was scuttiling but strained.<n><n><n><n>### Input<n>What is it about a pencil that can be used to produce shavings?

It's not legal to count (Option C: count) as the card dealers will know who has taken a peek at their cards. 2. It's not allowed to deal (Option E: deal) your own cards because the dealer at the table has been chosen by the casino management. So players have to play with the cards they are dealt. 3. It's not permissible from the casino's perspective to help (Option B: remember) as the dealers will be aware of the player's cards. 4. The casino's priority is to collect the money (Option D: winning) paid by players, so they cannot let a player leave with more than what they had at a particular time. 5.

When the show began, she did what? Choises:  A: persuaded B: slept C - D: did center stage Challenge E: spoke clearly Rationales:<n> 1. We know that the lady began her show with the tell story. We should assume that she was also the only one performing.<n> 2. By definition, persuasion means an attempt to persuade someone to do or believe something.<n>   <n> 3. Therefore, the lady can't speak clearly because this would be irrelevant to the actions happening in the scenario. <n> <n> 4. Also, because we know she is performing a tell story, she can't be sleeping.<n><n> 5. Because this information is only available after the show began, the answer of a one-man show is not in place of begin, and this is a logical contradiction as we know they must begin before the show can begin. Lastly, answer C: challenge is also not applicable because the lady can only challenge someone if her story is already being told as a challenge. <n> <n><n><n>6. The answer of taking center stage (D) is an action that occurs as a direct result of a tell story, as the performer assumes the role of lead performer.<n>However, the performance in the scenario only takes place after the show has begun. <n><n>7. Therefore, we should choose between taking center stage and speaking clearly. <n>8. We know the lady's performance did not include sleeping because this does not affect the performance and speaks clearly is unlikely because the show begins with the tell story.<n>9. So, we know the answer must be take center stage. Therefore, we should get this answer.<n><n>Answer:<n>```<n>answer == d<n>```

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What do people who are speech therapists do?

I will then make a list of all the activities associated with speech therapy for students in a classroom. I will go over a list to see if they make sense to me and see how specific I have been. <n><n>### Speech therapy:<n>1. Speech therapy for students is the treatment of a person diagnosed with a speech related disorder such as stroke, lisps, autism, or any number of other disorders. <n>2. They will assess a student’s speech and help them develop better communication skills. <n>3. If a student is having an issue with a speech impediment it could be due to a number of other issues.<n>4. If a student has any type of speech impediment it will affect their education and their development as they grow. <n>5. Some speech therapy would not include helping others but rather helping themselves. <n><n>## Task 1: Instruction<n>Read the instructions below and identify each of the tasks you must complete.

A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What could fighting inflation cause if it is not successful? Choices:  A: problems B: not noticeable C: deflation D: economic instability E: eat cake<n><n>### Response:		D: economic instability.<n><n>### Why:  In this question, answering is meant to provide information about the effect of deflation, "if inflation is not successful" of which the other options are already not successful. These options are already describing various unsuccessful things. B) "not noticeable" is not describing an outcome of inflation's unsuccessfulness. C) "deflection" is a type of outcome of inflation' s success or failure is not described as an unsuccessful consequence. E) "eating cake" is a possible consequence but it s not an outcome of inflation being successful or unsuccessful.<n><n>### Answer D: economic instability<n><n>### Rationale:<n>D. “Economic instability” means "the business cycle is causing problems". The idea of business cycles is already covered in the explanation of inflation where inflation can "lead to deflation and unemployment in the economy". This also makes the explanation of business cycles more useful; you already covered business cycles that could be useful in answering similar questions.<n><n>### Question Input: Where might a fish go if they cannot find their food? Choices:  B: water fountains C: seafood restaurants D: trees E: aquarium<n>Rationales:<n>1. The question is looking for some type of place where a fish could go if they can't find their food. <n>2. A tree (E) is not appropriate because a fish needs to have access to an aquatic habitat like water.<n>3. An aquarium (A) is unnecessary because it's already a contained environment where the fish could find their food.<n>4. A seafood restaurant (C) is not suitable because fish do not usually roam outside their habitat in search of food.<n>5. "Water fountains" (B) are not specific enough to answer the question, as they could refer to any type of water source. <n>6. This leaves us with the answer "D: trees" because trees can provide natural food sources for fish, like insects in the rivers and streams that are close to the tree. Fish can easily access this food source, making it an appropriate place to visit in search of their missing food.<n><n>### Input Question: In 1906, when did the great San Francisco earthquake occur?

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3.

This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:We do not have rest, so how are we feeling? Choices:  A: exhausted B: lonely C: worked all day D: were very tired E: feel better<n><n>### Response:		The question asked how we feel when we do not have rest. Therefore, the only options are A: exhausted, which does not make sense, given the context. We would not feel exhausted from rest. <n>We would feel exhausted if we did not have rest, because we would not be able to relax and recharge our batteries. This is because we don't know how long the rest would last, so we would not be able or know how to rest for the full length of time to completely recover and feel energized. So, the correct answer is C: worked all day,  because this is what we would feel like after we did not have rest.<n><n>### Input:"How are you going to complete this entire test?"

Choices: <n>A: first event B: last event C: only event D: worst event E: main event<n>Rationales:1. The question asks about what would be a major event for a stroke survivor. This implies that major events in a stroke survivor's life can be considered unique or singularly interesting or unique. <n>2. Option B: "last event" doesn't make sense because strokes tend to happen after years of time, not immediately before a single event. Option E: "main event" doesn't fit well because the question is discussing all strokes, not just one. 3. Therefore, option A: "first event" does not correspond as it implies the first stroke, rather there could potentially be multiple such events (first event meaning the stroke itself). Option C: "worst event" doesn't match either because there could be worse events than a stroke.  4. The correct answer is D: "only event". It's the only possible word that can be considered the correct answer because by definition. options A, B, C, and E do not work.<n>Answer: D:"only event"<n><n>Input: To get to his car, what is a route that Bob needs to avoid to reach his car?

It is important that she is allowed to graze in a setting close to a cow.<n>2. If we look at the word choice the options that make sense is the slaughterhouse. <n>3. A dairy farm is where calves are slaughtered for their meat. But the Heifer is not allowed to stay at the slaughterhouse for her last days, the cattle ranch is the the appropriate place <n><n><n>### Input : Which of the following does a bookkeeper keep track of and record? Choices: A: personal expenses B: bank account history C: employee performance reports D: business financials E: client payment balances<n><n><n>### Response : Employee performance reports <n><n>### Rationale:We know that a bookkeeper must keep track of and record business financials. We are asked about which of the five given choices is not included in the bookkeeper's responsibilities.<n><n>1. We also know that the correct answer cannot be a choice that already contains all the information given in the question.<n>2. Employee performance reports don't include any of the information in the other choices.<n>3. Therefore, since personal expenses, bank account history, and business financials are all things a bookkeeper typically keeps track of and records, we can infer that employee performance reports aren't something that an employee keeps track of and records. So, option D: business financials is the correct answer to the question.<n><n>## Input:Which of the following is similar to a human muscle? Choices: A. a lizard tail B. a kite C. a beaver tail D. all of the above<n><n><n>## Response:beaver tail<n><n>## Rationale:<n><n>### Instead, the answer can be determined by reasoning out the characteristics necessary for the question to have a valid answer.<n><n>1. The answer must somehow relate to a human body part.<n>2. It must use the concept of "similar" appropriately.<n>3. It must indicate a similarity between an object and a human body.<n>4. It needs to be an actual

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5.

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

Choices:  A: tennessee B: band practice C: orchestra D: violin case E: music store<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### Choices:<n>- Tennessee.<n>- Band Practice.<n>- Orchestra.<n>- violin Case.<n>- Music store. <n><n>#### Rationales:<n>1. Tennessee could not have tens of thousands of fiddles, as they are an instrument and therefore cannot physically exist on their own, not to mention the fact that ten thousand people cannot all afford to buy one fiddle.<n>2. Band practices and orchestras are also places where fiddle players can gather and play their instruments, but only tens of thousands of people in bands and orchestras would be able to play fiddle. <n>3. Violin cases, while useful for storing fiddles, only hold a few of them at a time, and it wouldn't be reasonable to expect there to be hundreds of thousands of these cases in a store which sells mostly normal guitars. <n>4. In addition, a music store like any other store that sells items only has a finite number of items that it can have at any one time.<n>5. Tens of thousands of fiddlers in one place is therefore not an option, so option C: Orchestra is the correct answer.<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>We can answer this question by recognizing that the question specifies that a place could have tens of thousands, or 10000, of fiddle players, which means that a place could have this many fiddle players congregate in one place in a short period of time, like in a band or orchestra. <n><n>### Input-How could you get your hands on something that most of the time you should get on your knees and give it a go?<n>* Choices: A.

To answer this question appropriately, we need to correctly answer the following questions: <n> - What is the theme of the question? - What is the author trying to test you on? <n> - If a person is beginning work when they aren't yet accomplishing something, what then, are they doing? <n> - When a person is beginning, what aren't are they doing yet?<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. The theme of this instruction is operations with numbers. <n>2. The person is asking what you could use to learn about operations with numbers.<n>3. If they have not yet completed something, they must still be doing it. So they are doing operations with numbers. 3. They are not yet accomplishing something, so they are beginning the task. <n>4. When a person is beginning a task, they can't accomplish it yet. <n><n>### Answer:<n>D: Operations with numbers could be found at a music school, but they would not be an appropriate answer because it's not what the author is looking for.<n>Answer: E: Operations with numbers in an office. <n><n>## Solution<n>Instruction:Answer the following multi-choice question.<n>Answer:<n><n>Input: When considering where something could go, which option is it not at this time?

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:The star had 4 rocky planets and 4 gaseous planets orbiting it, what was it part of Choices:  A: hollywood B: night sky C: constellation D: aliens E: solar system<n><n>### Response:		The answer was A: Hollywood.<n>### Rationale: In Star Wars, Han and Chewbacca travel to the fictious planet of Tatooine where they come across slaves who resemble "moisture farmers", a reference to the 1960's film the planet of the apes (Ross Held, 2018). In the film, many of the cast members were not allowed to touch the ground as their characters were from another planet. This was one of the inspirations for the costumes worn by Han and Chewbacc for Star Wars (Johnson, 2001).<n><n>### Input<n>The star had 4 planets, 2 of which are rocky and the other are in a gaseous state what makes the star part of the universe?<n><n>### Response<n>This is a very vague statement that uses the phrase "star had" which isn't an accurate way of saying the phrase. It would be more accurate to say, for example, "the Sun has 4 planets", which makes it accurate and clear. This phrase is too vague to be sure what this statement is asking.<n>### Rationales<n>The statement says "star had" which means that it has 4 rocky planes. The second sentence says "which are in a gaseus state."<n>### Option A: Hollywood<n>This is an overgeneralization statement that means that Hollywood is the basis for science fiction and that it originated from the Star Trek movie. It would be more direct to say that the statement originated from Hollywood.<n>### Option B: The Night Sky<n>This option implies that the universe and the sky are the same thing. If the phrase that was used was "Universe has 4 planets," then it would be a more precise and clear way of stating that the sentence should have been accurate, since it is saying that there are four planets in the universe and two of them are rocky and the others are in a gaseuos state. The other option is to say that the statement has 4 planets in the universe, but it is not stating whether it is in a gaseuor state.<n>### Option C: The Constellations<n>If this is the case, it would be more appropriate to say that the planet is an alien planet. When an alien planet is in the constellation,

This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3.

Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

Choices:  A: cinema hall B: mall C: department store D: closet E: shop<n><n>### Response:		The correct response would be “B: mall” since it is more likely for expensive clothing to be bought at a mall rather than a closed shop.<n><n>### Input<n>When someone is not sure what to do, what should they do when they're unsure of what to do? Choices: 1: ask someone 2: think again 3: do nothing 4: try something 5: quit 6: try again<n>Rationales:<n><n>As in the following sentence, the person who needs to act is 'X'. Since X is not sure what to act on, the correct response must be 4th (try something) because X will try the new solution for his problem. <n><n>A:  Try again.<n>B:  Quit<n><n>B:  Try again. Try to make the problem happen again. If the problem won’t happen, you'll try again.<n><n>B:  A try again is a try.

Choices:  A: strength B: brain C: potential D: qualification E: competence<n><n>### Response:		Rationales:  C. 1. The question asks about a disability that affects someone's what. This means we're looking for a noun that describes a person's abilities, which are typically referred to by their brain or mind. <n>2. A "strength" (Choice A) and a "potential" (Choice D) are abilities of the mind or brain, not the body. A physical disability such as blindness (Choice C) is unrelated to a person's mind or brain, and may not affect their potential or strength. A "qualification" (Choice B) is a noun that describes abilities or personal traits that a person has, but it doesn't necessarily describe the abilities of their mind or brain. Likewise, "competence" (Choice E) is a noun related to a person's ability to perform tasks or complete actions, but it doesn' t necessarily describe the brain or mind.<n>3. Therefore, the best choice for a disability affecting a person's brain is "competence" or "potential", since both of these describe mental capabilities. <n>4. As the "disability" is physical and does not affect a person's brain, this rules out the other nouns, leaving the choice of "competence" as correct. So, the answer to this question is C: competence.<n>Answer: B: brain

Choices:  A: ymca B: california C: park D: first floor E: school<n><n>### Response:		The swimming pool couldnt be refilled due to dought regulations but where was it located?<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the questions below. Note: The question is in the past simple tense because it was a historical event... you will need a passive voice form...<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: John invented telephone before Alexander Graham Bell, but why do we all call him the inventor of telephone today? Choices:  the reason we all call him the invenotr is due to B: he was the first to patent the telephone  because he was A: the only person who could figure out how a telephone worked B: it was his name before Bell C: because he was the first to talk on the telephone<n>Rationales:<n>1. Option A: The answer is because he was the first person who could figure out HOW the telephone worked. This means he had the idea and figured out how it would work, not who actually created the invention.<n>2. Inventors are typically the person who created a device or invention. So, the inventor is who the device came from, not their name or the name of the company that invented it. <n>3. The device is made by the inventor, not after their name. <n>4. Option C is not an appropriate response because it doesn't involve an invention. Although option C does relate to the reason we call him the inventor, it is a different reason than the original question. Option C describes why we don't call someone else the inventor of telephones in the present day... which is clearly not the question, but the explanation of the reason we know about other inventors. The word "why" in this question means the original intention behind calling Bell the inventor. <n>5. Option D involves taking someone and using their name instead of their actual invention. This does not seem to be what the question is asking.<n>6. Therefore, the only answer is:  The reason we all call Alexander Graham Bell the inventor of telephony is because he was the person who was the first to figure out HOW the phone worked... which is correct.

This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Why would a person be approached by a lot of people? Choices:  A: care about B: compliments C: know all D: popularity E: understand themselves<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales for A, C, and D: 1. All but the word "care" imply a complimentary or complimentary approach. <n>2. For options C and D, this suggests that popularity (things many people like or dislike) and not just popularity (a lot of people who you know or interact with) has a lot to do with the choice.<n>3.  Both "know all" and "care about" can be ambiguous because it does not necessarily indicate whether the person being approached is being sought out as a person or not. For instance, it could be interpreted as a compliment to being personable and approachable in any given conversation, rather than someone who knows all the facts about an issue.<n>4.  In option A, we can only conclude that the person is being approached because people they care about want to talk to them, which is not necessarily the case if they are popular or respected.<n>5. Option A does not work because "care about someone" usually implies a close relationship, not a desire to congratulate someone based on respect or popularity. <n>6. Option E: understand themselves can be answered in a personal manner or refer to a more general interest in one's feelings rather than popularity.<n>Rationales for B and E:<n><n>Option B does not work because a person would be approached by many people because they care about the well-being of friends and family, not because of compliments.<n><n>Option D does not work because the term "popular" implies that the majority of people don't really care about that person and their opinions, which is generally what one would refer to as popularity.<n><n>Option E does not work because, as stated above, it does not really refer to a specific number of people so it is a bit of a stretch when it comes to a specific answer.<n><n>Option C does not work because this is referring to an individual's behavior, rather than their popularity in a general sense.<n><n>Option F does not work because "knowing" something is different than being "approached" by someone with information you already have.

Options A: B: C: D: E: should be rejected because they do not fit the question and the clue. <n>2. D is the BEST answer to the question but should not be accepted because it is the simplest answer. <n>3. It is necessary to write a response that contains only one part that is true and one part that is false. <n>4. Feeling happy satisfies at least the definition of feeling. <n>5. There are many types of satisfied people and many ways to choose one. <n>6. A satisfied person usually feels satisfied and happiness. The person who feels better than satisfied is the one who has been feeling good enough for a long time, but not for very long, but does not last for very long. The person who has been feeling unhappy is the one who has not been feeling unhappy for a long time.<n>7. So the answer is D.<n><n>#### Answer: <n>

It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:They don't get grades or sit at desks, but crowds of fish do what? Choices:  A: pets B: fills the pond C: attempt to fly D: school together E: breath in water<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>D: school together<n><n>### Explanation:<n>This question is asking what the crowds of fish do. They do not get grades or sit on desks, and they also do not necessarily get the pets answers or attempt to fly answers. What this could mean is they go to school together for breeding purposes. This can be proven by checking the first sentence where it states "they don't get grdes or sit at desks" and that the fish are a "crowds of fish".

So you have to identify a way you could become an acrobatic. This can be done by identifying components (the nouns) in the question.<n>B) The most plausible way you could be an acrobatic is by performing gymanstics, which are a component of both (D) and (E).  They are the same gymnastic, but one is an instance of it, and one is an instance on which it is founded. (E) would be a good answer if (D) was omitted, but (D) is here because there is something wrong in (E). (E) is redundant, because you can learn gymnastic in (D). So (D) is the more plausible choice.<n>C) The most plausibel activity you could do to get to acrobat is to become a stunt man, since you can learn circus tricks there.

"Home" (C) may apply, but is not an ideal context as the security must be protecting someone from a danger that is external to the home (college) situation.<n>"Airport" (D) is also a place where security guards may be found, but they are not usually driving around in golf carts, only cars, for reasons of practicality.<n>"College/university" (E) is the only choice that is relevant to the situation described where a security guard driving around in their golf cart, protecting a young adult is involved.<n><n>Therefore, the answer is E: college/university<n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What planet is the atlantic ocean part of?

He picked a place that was inexpensive and offered few luxuries.  Where might he be staying? Choices:  A: farm B: town C: city D: hotel E: motel<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>I picked the choice 'C: city' because the sentence states that, “he picked a place that was the cheapest... Offering few luxuries” so I interpreted that this means that they picked (a) place that was cheap, and also in a city.<n>#### Justification:<n>The sentence says: “He picked a place that was INEXPENSIVE and offered few luxuries.”  He is looking for something not expensive and not many high-end, expensive features.  John is trying to spend the least amount possible.  However, since John didn’t want to spend money, he had to be in a city somewhere that was cheap.  Therefore, I chose the choice C: city.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: read book B: getting bored C: worry D: singing E: s never comes<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>1. The question asked for what happens when people are waiting. This means we need to identify activities that can happen when people are waiting.<n>2. Option A: read book is incorrect because in general, people in a state of waiting are not reading a book.<n>3. Option B: getting bored can happen during waiting, but there are other options as well.<n>4. Option C: worry is an activity that cannot happen when people are waiting, because you cannot worry before something happens.<n>5. Option D: singing is not likely because waiting usually does not have a singing component.<n>6.

An exception could be for waiting for nothing, but in this case, wait could also be used to describe the action of anticipating.<n>8. The answer can be one of several possibilities, but since B: getting bored is the best of those options, we can conclude that "an activity can happen" when people are waiting.

Choices:  A: gain experience B: taking notes C: listen carefully D: complete test E: focus<n><n>### Response:		When a student wants to hear what their professor is saying, they must listen carefully. <n><n>The question is asking us which response would an a student take in order to hear what the professor says. This entails distinguishing methods which the student could pursue to achieve their desired goal of hearing what their professor says. <n><n>### <n>### Input: Which of the following is a way to show respect? Choices:  a: shaking hands b: asking your elders to speak c: standing up d: saying hello <n><n>### Response<n><n>Saying 'Hello' is a way to show basic respect because it is an acknowledgment of the other person's existence, a fundamental component of basic courtesy in Western society. <n><n>When you approach a person and ask someone to speak, it shows respect as you are showing that you regard their experience as being equally as important as your own. <n><n>Sticking to the point is an example of being respectful as it ensures that your own point of view has priority, thereby respecting the other person's time. <n><n>Shaking hands is a very casual form of acknowledgement which is used in some contexts as an introduction but may not indicate strong feelings of respect. <n><n>Standing up is not a way to show respect because although it indicates that you consider their presence to be important, it does not go into any detail to show that you are respecting their words. Shaking hands shows basic respect or acknowledgement, but standing up shows that you value them highly on equal footing to yourself and would consider them to be important in your life. <n><n>Therefore, 'hello' is a way to express general respect, 'asking your elders to speak' is a way to indicate a sense of mutual respect,'shaking hands' is a way to acknowledge the other person's presence only and'sticking to the point' is a way to display an attitude of respect. <n>1. Hello: Hello is a simple way to acknowledge someone's presence. It is a pleasantry and does not indicate much deeper appreciation for the other person. <n><n>## Response: Hello is a very common way to say goodbye.

A: Wikipedia 2.B: google 3.c: reddit 4. D: all the options given are sources of information from the internet so the answer is D: all the options <n>Rationales: The answer can be found in the question. The keywords to look for are the question phrase "most" and "from" which are words that show that "most from" is a prepositional phrase. Phrases are groups of words acting as a single unit (e.g. "from the internet" or "the internet") that follow a verb or a predicate noun. Since a phrase has to be a single unit, it cannot contain a subject. So, when a question contains a prepositional phrase that contains the subject "most", there is always another word that the subject "from" is modifying. In this case, option D allows you to see that it's the phrase "from the internet" so that is the right answer.<n><n>### Input1: When a person is not feeling well they are doing the same activity as they were doing when they were feeling well, choose from the list. 1.

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:The wood became fossilized, what did the paleontologists call it when they found ti?

I could use an internet to check the origin of the phrase new england or something to see if this is a reference.<n><n>I don' have access to a large dictionary with old phrases in it, so to be safe could I provide an explanation here of how I think the answer was correct? I understand I'm supposed to provide the solution to the problem not explain it for you.<n><n>I think the question is asking where the small dog would be found in New England and the options are New Hampshire and Connecticut, but these are already in New England.<n>Then there is the answer, and when I saw the question in the puzzle, I wasn't sure how I knew it was right, but the best answer for me is England. So I googled the phrase old England and got a website that explained what "old England" means, and it is the southern UK. I think the puzzle is referring to the southern UK, although "England" has so many variants that I'm assuming it meant the United Kingdom, as it says new England.<n>Here's a screenshot of the website I used.

Choices:  A: hear crowd go mad B: working hard C: clap D: reproduce E: celebrate<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>This is a trick question in the fact that the correct answer is not 'C' or 'e'.<n><n>### Rationales: Why?<n><n>1. 'clapping' can be used as a noun that means 'the act of clapping by the audience', but this phrase is also used to mean 'enthusiastic applause', which is not at all in line with the concept of "a success that they enjoyed". <n>2. There is no implied context of time in regards to clapping, which further indicates that this phrase is not applicable here.<n>3.'reproduce' is also out of context here.<n>4. 'hear crowd go mad' makes sense considering that a large part of the appeal of a live show is the crowd's ability to be "enthusiastic".<n>

Choices: <n> A: create a new file system B: apply the same system that the computer has C: use a different one  D: change the computer's operating system E: change the system's operating system<n><n>Rationales: Given the instruction, we know that we need to find and apply a new system when we find a flaw in the computer.<n><n>1. Option A: create a new filesystem does not apply as it is a verb and it is not possible to "create" a filesystem.<n>2.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where do you put your grapes just before checking out?

Adjectives have other forms such as comparative and superlative forms.<n>* Option C and Option E are wrong as the verb form is also more common.<n>* There are adjectives which do not have an object (i.e. do not require a possessive form like 'the dog's bible' and 'the bible's teacher'). There are also verbs that do not take an object.<n><n>### Response<n><n>Writing <n><n><br><n>

Choices: 1. C: city B2. D: house E: street<n> <n>Rationales:<n>```<n>1. Option D: house is not a choice because a house is not part of a city.<n>2. Option E: street is not a choice since a city is usually not composed of a grid of streets.<n>3. Option A: city is the correct answer <n>```<n>Answer: A: city<n><n>### Instructions Input What is an adverb that describes the position of the hand? Choices:  C: on B: down D: up E: over<n>Rationales: The question has provided a scenario of a person pointing at the ceiling, which should prompt the user to answer with an adverb that indicates their hand position. Option over indicates a hand that is directly above another object. <n>Option up implies that the hand is above the point of reference. Option down is an option based on the incorrect assumption that pointing at the ceiling is a negative emotion based on the phrase "pulling the hand down". Option on implies hand position in front of an other object.<n>Option off is not appropriate because it is not logical based on the scenario as the ceiling is still the reference. Option in is out because a hand can still point at whatever point it chooses based on its position.<n>Option C: on is therefore the correct response. Answer: C: on

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4.

This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3.

Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What kind of driving leads to accidents?

Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

Choices:  A: owner B: foot C: subordinate D: base E: point<n><n>### Response:		A person who is the head of a branch would typically be yelling at some type of subordinate or employee, or perhaps if it was regarding some specific base or point of operation. All of these options are not particularly applicable to something like a store which is a branch store itself and is referred to as a "branch" in other terms that don't relate to hierarchy in this manner.<n><n>### Input (Demonstration):What is the most useful part of the human body? Choices:  a: heart, b: brain c: liver, d: feet e: hands<n><n>### Response (Rationales):<n>* The answer is actually a combination of parts of multiple body parts. A human heart can't live without the human brain as a whole. <n>* If one wanted to separate the elements of the brain and the human heart into separate parts and use them, one could conclude that the left ventricle is the most useful part, but then what is it useful for and how could it be detached and used as a separate body part? <n>* The liver could be considered the most useful part of this body and it does contain some unique physical and chemical properties that are useful in medicine. This could be taken as a correct answer. <n>* The feet could be considered useful for stability and walking, but this may be a more applicable answer for another type of body part. <n>* As the hands are considered the most useful body part to operate on, many operations are performed on and even inside human hands.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What is required to be good at playing tennis?

He was scared of what? Choices:  A: death B: coma C: peace D: forgetfulness E: loss of life<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>- A: This makes no sense, because if one is losing consciousness they aren't losing it in fear, they become unconscious or comatose out of fear of what?<n>```<n>- B: You have to think about the whole body, because if one is in a coma the entire body is shutting down so they aren't losing their physical/mental self, so to answer this question, I took the entire body into perspective.<n>- C: James can find comfort in the fact that he is not suffering physical and mental pain. In this sense, he could be said to feel peace without having true peace, a feeling of peace only being the absence of fear and pain.<n>- D: One might feel as if they are in a dream-like state, but this isn't what James is feeling. The answer to this is coma.<n>- E: It is not an option as it is not what James is truly scared of, the answer is coma.<n><n>### Answer: Option E

This will help in improving our logical reasoning and critical thinking. We will also be learning how to create instructions that provide a suitable answer to questions by describing the steps required for completing the task and explaining the proper responses. With practice, we can perfect our understanding of instructional text and develop our skills in logical reasoning and critical thinking through completing similar exercises. 
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:John was punching and punching at the wall but succeeded only in bloodying his knuckles. This was bad.  He would be unable to hold his tools if he injured what? Choices:  A: hostility B: anger C: nose D: fists E: hands<n><n>### Response:		<n>John hurt his hands punching the wall, which is what the text says is the problem. In the sentence, "He would be unable to hold tools", the meaning is that if John had been injured punching the wall he would be unable to hold any tools. John would not be able to hold angry/angry/fist/fists/or hands.<n><n>This is a pretty complicated question. It asks you to find the antecedent of the pronoun "what", which is a type of pronoun that points to something else earlier in a phrase. "When he punched the wall, what was injured?" "His hands" is the most logical response since it matches the example "bloody hands." Here's what I wrote:<n><n>> His hands were bloody but when John punched the wall he wasn't thinking about the pain those punches caused; he was focusing on his goals.<n>> It wasn't until he had failed in his mission that he realised he'd also injured his very hands.  If his hands were hurt then he wouldn't be able to do anything, not even hold his tools.<n><n>As you may be able to tell I'm being creative with this one. :)  If I was a high scoring student I would be trying my best to only answer questions about people and animals as I'm sure you can get all the animals.<n>

Choices:  A: kitchen cupboard B: pantry C: grocery store D: pantry E: refrigerator<n><n>### Response:		If you had a jar that would spoil if left out then you would want to put it into a pantry because a pantry is a place for food that should be kept in a cool environment. The choice is pantry.<n>### Explanation: The reason that we choose pantry is because in our daily lives most people think that the pantry is actually a cupboard. The reason that we would choose the pantry over the cupboard is that cupboard keep our things nice and neat.<n>### I thought of kitchen cupboard when I saw this question because if I had this jar I would want to put it in my kitchen where I would know that it would stay nice and cool.<n>### Also, I considered the grocery store because a lot of food that goes into the grocery store is actually kept in a cool place that is refrigerated. The reason is because when you put food in the refrigerator it stays nice and cool which will then help to reduce the bacteria growth on that item.<n>### So if I had the jar which was likely to be spoiled if left out then I would put it in the grocery store. But then I would think about how the person that is trying to put the item in the refrigerated area would have to show identification or a special pass to even step inside of the place.<n>### Also if I had the jar then I would choose the pantry because it's just like a cupboard. The only difference of pantry compared to a cupboard is that the pantry is in the kitchen. What we consider a pantry it's just the cupboard next to the refrigerator where we store food.<n>### Because every time you have food and you put it in the refrigerater where the temperature is controlled it will help to reduce the growth of bacteria. <n>### In conclusion I would choose to put my jar inside the pantry because I don't need to worry about the bacteria growth as much when the food is put in the pantry. The reason that we choose  pantry is because in everyone daily life most people think that the <n><n>### input:When my mother would say, "Where I used to live" what would she most likely be talking about?

So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:To learn must have the right book, to work efficiently what must one have? Choices:  A: improve yourself B: become knowledgeable C: have tools D: persistence E: have more knowledge<n><n>### Response:		Input: To work efficiently what must one...<n><n>1. What the question implies, is that one needs certain tools in order to work efficiently. It's not talking about a person's work skills or job duties, but rather the items required to be effective in any kind of work environment. <n>2. According to this logic, persistence (D) and having more knowledge (E) would not be enough to efficiently work in a work environment. <n>3. However, improving yourself (B) or having the correct book (A) would certainly be necessary in some cases to perform a given job. <n>4. In conclusion, the correct answer is A: improving yourself. This is because the question is simply referring to skills and tools that one needs for work efficiency, not their knowledge of it. <n>5. This is a somewhat confusing question, but the best answer is A: improve yourself.<n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7.

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:If somebody likes temperatures cool, they might have more than one electric fan where?

This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where are people likely to stand at an intersection?

Choices:  A: cook dinner B: study french cooking C: taste sauce D: prepare food E: thin sauce<n><n>### Response:		French cooking isn't something a chef can learn without studying it.<n><n>### Reason:If we have to answer the question by choosing only one of the presented options, we can exclude the options that are obviously wrong, those that cannot occur at the time (no chef can cook dinner or taste sauce after the evening).<n>A chef is someone who does cooking at the time during the evenings, and he can't prepare food before, so none of the options starting with P (P:prepare) can be correct.<n>Studying french cooking does not mean the chef's ability to cook the dishes from french cuisine, it is about reading about their preparation.<n>We can't say the chef uses something thick to get rid of sauces, especially that the word thick and thicken is commonly used to describe something thicker than before, but this can be easily achieved by adding some corn starch to it when the food is still hot.

We know the question is asking for a place of work, as other places such as schools and restaurants would include places to drink cups of coffee. <n>2. We know trains aren't workplaces, but airports and office buildings are. <n>3. Even if one were to work at a train (B), one wouldn't find a place to drink coffee in an office as coffee is not made for people to drink at the train station.<n>4.

This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What will telling many people about an embarrassing situation lead to? Choices:  A: notoriety B: emotional distress C: riot D: bad dreams E: annoyance<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I don't understand what you are looking for. I am not good at grammar nor am I a native speaker. And I don't want to do this for my whole life, that's why i'm studying English...<n><n>### Input<n>Answer the following multiple choice questions. Where are you located? Choices: 1. Above ground level 2. At sea level 3. Above the moon 4. At the North Pole 5. Below ground level<n><n>### Demostration<n>Rationales: One of the things that is common about all of the answers is that all five are not at ground level. However, we do not know what kind of landmass or terrain our specific location is on, so it is difficult to narrow our options down any further.<n><n>Eg Above ground level would make sense if our location were a hill - but as we don't know what type of terrain we are on, this is not an applicable answer.<n><n>Rationales: The moon, as the literal meaning of the word implies, is an object in space. <n><n>As the question asks for a location, however, the moon does not necessarily qualify as a place. As a place, the moon would only be applicable if we happened to be on the moon. Therefore, we can eliminate the moon as a possible answer.<n><n>### Rationales<n>Option 5: Below ground level:  As per the rationales discussed in answer choice B, we cannot determine whether or not we are on a hill. However, we can determine if we are on an island, because islands are usually not a part of earth's crust and must therefore be located in water. As we can already eliminate answers 2 and 4, option 5 is therefore the most appropriate choice.<n><n>Option 1: Above ground level: While it may seem intuitively obvious that option 1 would be the correct answer, the problem with this answer is that we aren't told what kind of landmass we are on. If we are, for example, on a mountain, option 1 would make sense. But if we are on a hill, or if the question had been worded to indicate that we were on an elevated landmass (i.e. a peninsula or headland would suffice), option 1 would not be the correct answer. <n><n>If we can

So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:The woman picked from an apple tree while surrounded by other trees, where was she? Choices:  A: illinois B: woods C: new york D: indiana E: farmer's market<n><n>### Response:		<n>The woman was in Illinois while surrounded by other trees.<n>### Explanation for the answer choice:<n>We do not know the gender of the woman, which makes the response ambiguous. Therefore the solution involves combining "was" with a pronoun.<n><n>### Solution:<n>The response: The [pronoun] woman picked from an apple [pronoun] tree while surrounded by other [pronoun] trees, where was she.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The sentence is asking where a woman was when she picked an apple from a tree while being surrounded by other trees. Here's a breakdown of the question:<n>1. A: Illinois<n>2. B: Woods<n>3. C: New York<n>4. D: Indiana<n>5. E: Farmers Market<n><n>The answer is Illinois. We can do this based on the following:<n>1. The first part of the question (the woman picked from an apple) must be a fact.<n>2. We don't know if it would be impossible to have an apple tree and other trees in the same place.<n>3. Therefore the first part can also be the second part.<n>4. Thus we can conclude the second part (the tree) must be in Illinois (the woman was with the apple).<n><n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: train station B: house C: cupboard D: cricket stadium E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: air (or a breeze) from a train station can only be found in a train station, not a house, cupboard, or cricket stadiums. The same is true of an airplane's baggage hold. Similarly, air (or a bicycle breeze) originating from the surface of the earth can only be found outside the surface of the earth. So we shouldn't have to consider choices B: house C: cuboard. The same is probably true of D: cricket stadiums. So to find the answer we need only consider choice E: surface of earth.<n><n>### Input<n>It is clear in the original question that the air breathed by just a few people recently must be air from inside a closed-in space. The only closed-in spaces we can envisage being filled with air are houses, airplanes, baggage holds, or ships. The question also specified that the place from which air originates must not have been accessed by a large number of people recently. If a closed-in space has recently been entered by a large number of individuals, the air contained within has already been "breathed" by those individuals.

A strong wind or wind of any sort should overpower the resistance of a container. It would take a little wind to do this same if it is a strong wind because the resistance is smaller as the wind has less to push against.<n><n>What does this mean?<n><n>A: no wind<n><n>B: no strong wind<n><n>C: light wind<n><n>D: a very strong wind<n><n><n>### It is necessary to use a particular item after using another item, such as a pen after using a pencil.<n>### Answer: <n>It is necessary to

Choices:  E: a factory A: an office B: a government building C: a mall D: a library<n><n>1. E is the answer because a factory is a building where workers are busy making products.<n>2. Choice A is not the answer because not all office buildings house offices that operate constantly.

Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where does a person need to get when they have more kids? Choices:  A: compliments B: understand themselves C: life partner D: second chances E: larger house<n><n>### Response:		Choice A, compliments, does not belong in this paragraph, since the purpose is to describe what the person getting the first choice will be needing, not compliments. I will choose choice B, understanding themselves.<n><n>### Input for Response: This is why choice b, understanding themselves won't work, because the paragraph is only mentioning a possible challenge of having more children if said children live to be 100, and you have 100kids, you may find it hard to understand one of them, so this is the purpose of the paragraph.<n><n>### I have chosen the answer, I'll provide the rationale for that answer in the next 24 hours.<n><n>### Response <n>I would choose option B because it's the only choice that makes sense and answers the question clearly.<n><n>Demonstration: If you knew nothing about plumbing and were trying to find some plumbing, which of the following would you not likely look or go to:<n>a) a toilet.<n>b) a basement floor drain.<n>c) a shower head.<n>d) your main water shutoff valve.<n>e) a wall toilet.<n><n>Explain: It seems logical that a person looking for some plumbing would not look for a toilet, but it doesn't feel logical to exclude a shower head or main water shut off valve.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>It seems reasonable that people wouldn't look to a basement floor dane. However, this is not an answer to the question "where could you find some plumbering...", which is why this question is marked incorrect.<n><n>### An example that fits the correct answer<n><n>If you are looking for a water fountain, of course you won't look in a show, because a show is like a play or theater, and you're most likely looking outside or in a hallway, not in a theater. That's like saying that a show is a water fountain!<n>

Choices:  A: classroom B: toy store C: school D: soccer game E: dinner<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>**Answer:** A. Children always love fun places rather than boring and educating.<n><n>#### Instructions:Answer the following question.<n><n>#### Rationales:<n>1. The question asked which places are not interesting to children. This means a place that children typically find interesting and would not find interesting.<n>2. A boring place would be more uninteresting than a boring place.<n>3. A boring place is typically more uninteresting to children if it is boring to them overall. There are multiple places that both children and adults can find interesting, so we can't rule out all choice options.<n>4. Thus, we can conclude the answer is A: classroom, which is typically not as interesting to children as it is for adults.<n><n>#### Answer:<n><n>**Answer**: A: Classroom<n><n>### Input What group doesn't need a doctor? Choices:  C: a doctor A: a doctor's office B: a hospital D: a nursing home F: patients of doctors<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>1. The question is comparing the different groups that do and do not need a doctor. This refers to a particular kind of doctor, which is a specific healthcare professional, as opposed to all healthcare specialists. <n>2. A doctor is a doctor, and they all need doctors. <n>3. People cannot be described as the doctor's office. At most, they would be the patients in the doctor's office, so this is ruled out. A doctor's office is definitely not the same as their professionals themselves. <n>4. Additionally, a hospital does not necessarily require a person, much like doctors do. Hospitals still generally require nurses, physicians, administrative staff, and other workers, such as housekeepers and other care providers. <n>5. Nursing homes are definitely not healthcare professionals, so we can eliminate option B. <n>6. Therefore, the only choice that has doctors in it is option C: a doctor's practice, which refers specifically to the doctor profession. <n>7. We also know that, within doctors itself, doctors need doctors.<n>8. Thus, the correct answer to this riddle is option C: a physician's practice.<n><n>### Answer:

So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:People are purposefully harming others, what trait are they exhibiting? Choices:  A: deceptive B: altruistic C: stupid D: cruel E: agressive<n><n>### Response:		Based on the provided information, the correct choice and best response is option C – stupid. <n><n>### Rationale:In the provided scenario, it is indicated that people are purposefully harming each other. This doesn't simply suggest cruel (E) behavior; it instead suggests purposefully antisocial (i.e., harmful).<n><n>In the context of the given scenario, option D – cruel does not make sense. Although people can be cruel (E), they can also be cruel (E) for several reasons other than being purposefully antisocial. Further, option A - deceptive is not an answer choice for the following reasons:<n><n>1. Deceitful behavior can be purposeful and/or unintentional.<n>2. Deception can occur for other reasons, too, such as to protect oneself or others from harm.<n>3. Deception does not necessarily mean that the offender will also harm the other person.<n>4. In the context, there isn't even any mention of deception being used as a means to harm another person.<n><n>Option B - altruistic is not an answer choice because altruistic individuals always do good; harmful individuals can also be altruistic. Option B - altruist is just a synonym for option B - altruism. Option C - stupid is the best choice because stupidity is being used as an intentional reason to harm someone else, whereas options A, B, and D lack intentionality.<n><n>Option D - cruel is not the best choice because intentional harmfulness is being used as a reason to harm someone else. Option E – agressive is not the best choice for several reasons, including the following:<n><n>1. Aggressive can be used as a noun for one's mindset or temperament or to mean being harmful.<n>2. However, the given scenario suggests that intentional harmfulness rather than harmfulness alone is the cause of the behavior.<n><n>### Input-Output examples<n><n>Input: Which of the following statements about the word “enjoyable” is false?

This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

Choices:  A: middle east B: palace C: dictionary D: pots E: apartment<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: Where would a ficus plant in a room? Choices:(1)A: middle east B: pots C: beds D: dictionary E: palace<n>Rationale: 1. The word 'brighten' can only be interpreted as "to make (something) brighter or more luminous". We know that plants absorb and release light in the form of photosynthesis, so it is most likely that the ficus plant is used to increase light levels in a room. The plant might make a room look more "brighter" or "luminous", or it might indirectly help to brighten the room by increasing the natural light. So, we should look for an option that mentions brightening a 'room'. <n>2. The ficus plant (A) doesn't mention anything about increasing light levels in a room and is therefore not a correct answer. <n>3. The plant is not used specifically in pots (C). <n>4. The plant most likely is NOT used to brighten a bedroom, and is likely not used to brighten the apartment either (D). <n>5. A ficus plant would be unlikely to be used in a palace, since a palace is far larger than an apartment. <n>6. A dictionary (B) and a palace (E) both mention a ficus plant. And a dictionary often associates words with images, so that would indicate that the dictionary is not simply a list of words, but includes images and ideas as well. To say the ficus plant is in a dictionary would only make sense if the dictionary is a large volume that has images and more context about the word. Therefore, a dictionary would not brighten a room like the option stated. <n>7. Option (E) mentions the ficus plant could be found in a palace, however, it is irrelevant regarding the prompt. The answer we choose in this case is D: dictionary.<n>Answer: D. The word 'brighter' means to make (something) brigher or more luminous<n><n>### Input : What isn't a way to know how many stars are in the Milky Way galaxy?

We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:It was a vast complex, the launch pad was just one part of what? Choices:  A: movie B: cape kennedy C: space center D: military installation E: spaceship centre<n><n>### Response:		 D: military installation<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>1. "Vast complex" can refer to a large number of things, but the focus of the question is on the launch pad, which is the only piece of infrastructure mentioned that would have a military significance. Therefore, the military installation is the most likely answer. <n>2. As movie (A) and spaceship centre (B) are not typically locations where missiles or rockets are launched, and neither do cape kennedy (C) or space center (D) refer to a military launch pad, they are not appropriate choices. <n>3. However, A, B & C are all options that can refer to launch sites, which means we should rule them out to eliminate these as the answer.<n>4. The question is also asking for a part of a launch site, which doesn't necessarily have to be the military installation, but the military installation is certainly a part of the launch site.<n>5. Therefore, it makes the most sense to say that it was a vast complex, and the launch pad was just part of what was referred to as the launch site, therefore the military installation is an acceptable answer choice.<n><n>### Input:- How long was it  for you  to get your own set of plates after becoming an adult? Choices:-  A: not long B: few years C: long D: many years<n>Answer: B:  few years<n><n>### Rationales:-<n><n>1. "Becoming an adult" and "got your own set of pltes" don't necessarily refer to the same concept.<n>2. This means that "becoming an adult" doesn't really refer to an exact age, and plates can't possibly be made for someone who hasn't become an adult yet. <n>3. There is no reason to believe plates could suddenly be made for a person who hadn't gotten them yet. <n>4. Therefore, the plates should have already been made (as it isn't possible to suddenly get plate after age 00), so getting it from this information would mean the time spent looking for plates, or the actual time spent buying it is the likely answer, and looking for it is something adults would likely not have done while they were children, so buying plates was most likely the adult's first time.<n><n>### How is this

The word 'locker room' is not included in the sentence, and it is out of scope of its context.

The 'locker room' portion of the sentence is redundant and not necessary to the context, so omitting it makes sense. Furthermore, choice (B) is incorrect because motels don't always include 'gy mnasiu'rooms. <n><n>Choice (A) was the correct answer because it was the word choice that was given and it is a correct contextual placement. <n><n>Choice  (C) was incorrect, because even if it were a correct choice, 'the seashore' doesn't make sense as an expectation.<n><n>Choice (D) was incorrect because it includes the context 'bathroom' and is not an amenity as the question mentioned.<n><n>Choice (C) was incorrect because "bath room" could be a hotel room or an amnesty. Neither of these would be an amenity.<n><n>Choices (B) and (D) are not contextual.<n><n>Choice (E) does not make sense because, even if it were a possible definition of the word 'room,' it doesn't follow from the question.<n><n>The sentence read:"A shower is an amnesty when you reserve XYX."

These are: "wait for the doctor", "difficult for people", "need to do work", and "who need to do work".<n><n>The only phrase that mentions an activity directly related to time is the phrase, "wait for the doctor". Any other time reference in the question is either referring to a circumstance relating to a person's work, like needing to do work, or a result of a person's circumstance, like difficulty.<n><n>**Choice:**<n>We can eliminate choice C because it refers to a circumstance and does not specifically call out time.<n><n>**Choice E:**<n>Phrases relating to impatience are not related to time.<n><n>**Option B:**<n>This is the only one of the four phrases that specifically mentions time, and it is referring to appointments. <n><n>**Choice B:**<n>We can assume that people want to do their work (e.g., a doctor's appointment is for the purpose of receiving healthcare to do with an illness or injury, not for entertainment). <n><n>**Choice: B**<n>Therefore, the correct answer is choice B - having appointments.<n><n>### Input A word that is used to describe the feeling of displeasure because of having to do the dirty work.

Choices:  A: shopping cart B: cashier C: shopping mall D: supermarket E: bookstore<n><n>### Response:		B<n>The question is, where would you get a bag if someone fills it with clothes. Let’s take a moment and read the full instructions “ Where could you find some clothing that would not help you get dressed?”. Option B is the best answer because the question is asking where you could “find some clothing and not getting dressed”. In other words, you are in a “business where clothes are sold” and you look around for clothes and decide which ones you like, then you “fill the bag with clothes”. Now, when you are done, you ask someone “who serves you” to give you a “bag to put the clothes in”. Now the question is: where does the bag come from? Well, it comes from the other person who serves you. The bag has already been in another “store” and not here in the “business where clothes is sold” so option B is what we choose.<n><n>### Input<n>I’m at work and I need to take a break.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where would you put a handle if you want to bring it with you? Choices:  A: briefcase B: coffee cup C: carry object D: frying pan E: on a hat<n><n>### Response:		A. Briefcase.<n>> Rationales:<n>1. Briefcase contains handle. <n>2. Coffee cup and frying pan have handles. <n>3. Carry object has handle. But it does not say handle. <n>4. Briefcase contains more items than carry object. <n>4. Handle is not on a hat.<n><n>### Input/Output: You cannot eat food with an apple. What object, when put into the sink, would you not wish to wash?

This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:while luck plays a big role, every person who is great at something has focus and what to it? Choices:  A: hatred B: surprised C: compliments D: dedication E: solutions<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Input:Where should a person who is interested in becoming a pilot find more info? Choices: A: the library B: the airport C: online D: a friend E: a professional organization<n>Rationales:This question asks for a location to find more info about becoming a pilot. The location can be either online or in person, so it's worth noting that the airport is not the correct answer.<n>Option D, a friend could actually help by recommending other resources or giving their own advice on how to become a pilot. However, they would not be a location that could provide more information on the subject.<n>Option A, the library, could be helpful as long as the person knows what section to go to and what materials to look through, which could prove difficult without any prior knowledge of flying planes.<n>And, option E, a professional organization, could also be a source of information about the process of becoming a pilot, but it would likely not be a primary location for learning more about that subject.<n>Therefore, the answer to this question is option C, online.<n><n>Input: What type of person would often be seen wearing a black hat that is also large and round? Choices: 1. B: gangster<n>2. B: gangster 3: C: gangster 4: gangster 5: gangster<n>Rationales:1-3. The black hat that is large and round is often associated with a type of person that is also associated to the choice B: gangster. The choice B: gangster is often associated to criminal activities, which is why you can associate it to a large black hat and make the association.<n>4. Gangster and gangster are associated  but what we can infer from the question is the association of gangster and gangster as the image or picture of a person that wears this choice of hat.<n>5. The choice C: gangster is not likely to be correctly answered, as it's not as strong of a relationship as B: gangster and gangster.<n>6. There's probably a few people out there or perhaps even more people that fit the choice B: gangsters choice of description that's related to the type of person described by the question.<n>Answer: B: gangster<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where do most people keep their curling iron stored?

Choices:  A: bathroom B: purse C: drug store D: hand lotion E: water<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Demonsteration:<n>1. The key to answering this question is to think about where moisturizer products are typically stored. <n>2. We know that moisturizers are used to moisturize skin. <n>3. Typically, moisturizers are stored in the bathroom. <n>4. It is unlikely a person would store moisturizers in a hand lotion or a water. <n>5. It is also unlikely a person would carry moisturizer with them in their purse. Therefore, the answer would be from option B: purse.<n><n>#### Demonsteration:This answer is incorrect. <n>Bathrooms aren't the right answer because the question asks where a good place to buy something specific, in this case moisturizer. The question may be misleading, since it seems like the question is asking where to find moisturizer, when that could be anywhere in any room...but it actually asks where to buy moisturizer, so the answers need to be based on that.<n><n>Another part of the question is where water is NOT an option to buy moisturizers. If you didn't know this already, you could assume that water is the correct answer.<n><n>Finally, the word "where" is important as the question asks for it, but this part is ignored.<n><n>So, even though the question didn't directly mention which room of the house to find moisturizing products, the word "where", plus the incorrect words bathroom and water, led to this specific wrong answer of purse.<n><n><n>### Answer:  A: bathrooms<n>

Choices:  a: on the ice b: skating rinks c: the streets d: in pools e: the beach<n>Rationales: a. 1. In a: on the ice, the term on the ice makes it easy to decide this is referring to skating on an ice skating rink.<n>2. This is consistent with the context of the question, which is about ice skating, so this is an appropriate response.<n>b. 1. B: the street is not what is happening here as it is just a random location, and this seems inappropriate given in context of ice skating.<n>2. This doesn't follow the rules of context because ice skating doesn't take place on a regular basis on the street in a city environment.<n>c. 1. C: the pool does not seem to make sense in context.<n>2. Since ice skating is an activity done during the winter, pools are more common during warmer seasons and are not typically an ice skating location.<n>d. 1. D: the beach does not logically relate to ice skating in any way, so it is not an appropriate response for the context of the question.<n>2. This does not follow the rules of context as ice skating is more specific. It's also hard to imagine ice skating on the beach, especially in cold weather when ice would also be hard to skate on.<n>e. 1. E: the open throat is not applicable.<n>2. This would probably be an acceptable response for something that is not ice skating, however it doesn't seem to follow rules of context<n>Answer: A: ice skating rinks

Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:He got a job dancing and waving an advertisement, he got to be outside instead of stuck inside the what?

The opposite of being hot would be being cold, but the opposite of being humid would not always be being dry. The opposite of humid would be being arid, but the opposite of humidity may also be cold.<n><n>### Response:- The opposite of cold is warm.<n>### Instruction<n>Demonstration:<n>Input:'It could help, it could be a trap, it could be a snare. What?' <n>Choses: 1.A: trap B: snare C: help <n>Rationales:Trap, snare, and help are all verbs that describe the actions and effects of a person or object. This makes them correct choices, but more so, trap and snare imply negative consequences or outcomes for the person, so we can eliminate those options. Therefore, the correct answer is B. <n><n>##| [Input](Inputs/)<n>##| [Instruction](Instructions/)<n>##| [Inputs](/Inputs/)<n>### Response:<n><n>

It then immediately goes on to state that if he hadn't been more prepared, he would likely not have done so well. But A isn't saying that if the president hadn't been well prepared, he'd likely NOT done so well. It's already assumed that he wouldn't have done as well if he hadn't prepared, so the word "likely" doesn't change this fact.<n><n>The second sentence is similar, but it

To answer this question, we need to go through the steps of a specific type of patent application, then identify if we can find any information that is applicable to the given example of "idea become reality" before the end.<n><n>```<n>    The first thing you need to know is that there are only a few types of patent. The two main type of patents are Utility and Design patents (https://www.nyus.org/services-for-inventors/legal-affairs/protect-your-inventions/patent-applications/pursuing-a-utility-or-design-patent). Design patents protect the external ornamental elements of a product, while utility patents protect the functionality of a product in terms of its performance or usage (ex. how it works, or how it's used).<n><n>    Then, we need to identify which type of patent was applied for. To do this, we can look at the question where the text reads "patent". This usually indicates that a Design patent was applied for, not Utility.<n><n>    Now if a patent was applied for Design, we need to determine if the design was applied for under a Design Patent or a Copyright (copyright law cannot be applied for products, only media such as a song or book). A Design patent is for a specific ornamental design of a product, while a Copyright is for a unique configuration of features on a product (https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102).<n><n>    To identify this, we can look for information about the product. In our given example, we can determine through text that this product is a shoe because the nugget of gold weighs 14kg. Using this information, we can determine it is most likely a Design Patent because the ornamental design on the product has been patented (notice we did not say the product itself).<n><n>    Now that we we've identified if this was a Design or Copyright patent, we can continue analyzing the question. To answer this, we

Choice: A: lot of grievance(s).<n><n>**Input:** What is a negative effect to **someone other than a spouse** when two spouses are **getting divorced?** Choices:  A) lot of grief B) depression C) no spouse D) lose money E) children suffer **Rationales: 💉 1.***The question asked to identify a negative aspect that **is not related** to marriage in general, which involves excluding any references to married people. 💉2.***All options *A) lot of grief, B) depression,* and *C) no spouse* are focused on specific individuals who are directly involved in a divorce: *husbands* and *wives.* These are only *someone* else when they have already been divorced, as they're no longer part of the relationship. 💊3.***The effect must also be a negative one, as the effect is the result of divorce. Options *D) lose money* and *E) children suffer* are not negative effects because the amount of money lost is still variable, and children suffer *from* a divorce and would be considered positive in terms of the question. They would not be negative effects of divorce. 💂<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Answer the questions below: Each question has four options; select the best answer.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:James looked for a pencil sharpener.  Where might he look first?

The answer would be ''library''.<n><n>### 4. The correct answer is B because the image shows that the library is a ''first'' option if you are looking for the ''library''. B stands for ''library''.<n>### 5. The rational explains that the answer for this set of questions is B: library.<n><n>### A common feature for these two tasks is that they are both in a multiple choice format.<n>### Here, there are four distractors.  You can tell this by the four distractors.<n>### As shown, the correct answer is 16 and the incorrect answers are 5, 7, and 27. <n>### The question itself is a little bit confusing because of the number of distractors, but the answer is still correct.<n>### However, there is no explanation of how to answer the question in the correct way.<n>### Instead, one must guess the correct answer by removing distractors from the list until the correct number is all that is left.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7.

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:He found the blowfish off the coast of the Carolina's, it was where?

Choices:  A: rain forest B: research laboratory C: cage D: treetops E: south africa<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input:The question asked where a monkey taken away from their home is taken to. This involves identifying a possible place where they are taken. <n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>Rationales:<n><n>1. The question is about a person's home (as this is referenced in the 'are often brought to...their home they came from'), so it's a stretch to suggest that they are brought to E: south africa as this is a misrepresentation of the question's intent. <n><n>2. This means they could be brought to places that are not south africa, such as B: research laboratory. <n><n>2a. We know this is possible because a research laboratory would have the ability to house and test on captive monkeys. This could mean the research laboratory could be used for the purpose of gathering information or performing monkey testing. <n><n><n>3. In option D: treetops, we can see that this relates to the question's mention of a monkey's home, as it suggests a 'home-like' type of environment. However, we can be certain that option D: treetop cannot apply to the question's context because in option D we can see that there are monkeys, which indicates that it must at least partly apply to the question. We also know that a large majority of people's 'home' wouldn't necessarily be in the treetops. So, we can conclude that option D: treettops also can't hold true to the question's intent: the monkey was taken away from their home, not added to the treetops.<n><n>### Answer<n><n>So we can conclude that B: research lab can be a possible selection because it fits the context and intent of the question as an answer.<n><n>### What is the difference between A, B, C and D?<n><n>Input (Option A) : A group of children is learning to drive in this one place, not in one of these places.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where do fish spend the majority of their time?

It is not necessarily applicable to fish, as they are typically thought of as living under a different type of water: aquatic.<n><n>Option D: toilet (D) is a human-specific location, therefore not applicable.<n><n>Option B: the body of water (B), while technically correct, does not apply to majority spending time in a single location, and thus does not provide clear insight into the fish's activity time.<n><n>Option C: underwater (under water) (C) is a location that fish tend to spend the majority of their lives, so this is the best choice.<n><n>Option E: aquarium (E) is a specific location within a body of water that would be an ideal habitat for many fish species. However, not every fish species is able to survive in an aquarium, and they must be able to survive in a variety of bodies of water, so this is not the most appropriate choice.<n><n>### Input<n>Input:  A 7-letter word (A) which begins and ends with the same letter  Choices:  B: one (a one - a number)  C: a one - a number (a number)  D: a one (a one - 1 letter)  E: seventeen (a 7-letter word)<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>- D:<n>- C: a one - 1 letter (a number) is a four letter word<n><n>### Rationale:<n>- the question asked about a seven-letter word (A), which only has 1 option.<n>- Option B: a one (a number) (B) is 1 letter long, so it is not a 7-letter word. <n>- the correct answer for this question is Option D: a one (A) since it begins and ends with the 1st and 7th letter of the alphabet and is a 7-letter sequence.<n><n>### Rename a list with a similar item<n>#### Input: There is a group of people who make lists of items for things they wish they would.

I first decided which information was relevant to this task before I did any analysis. The relevant information was given in the sentence: "last fall you passed through the forest" the book, couch, car and cat are irrelevant details. This is because there is no relevance to the topic and the question doesn't specify what 'appears after you pass'.<n><n>I used the SQ3R reading skills technique to go through the passage. My reading strategy enabled me to get a deeper understanding of the text. From this I was able to establish the passage as fact through EBI. My reading strategy was further developed by using comprehension. I have been using this method to read every day to make sure I understand what I learn. <n><n>### Justification:<n>I chose the best answer among the choices because it is the only answer that has no irrelevant information. The book, car, cat and couch are not necessary to the answer because they are mentioned as irrelevant details that don't need to be factored in. The green couch isn't relevant because couches appear in homes rather than forests, the red leather book can't be answered because the text doesn't say you saw a book, it could have been anything. And as for the pair of scissors there isn't specifics to what the "pile" is as it could be anything. I also chose to skip the green couch as it is irrelevant. The blue car was skipped because it is irrelevant

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:The shark was migrating between continents, where did biologists find it?

Choices:  A: dairy farm B: texas C: building D: michigan E: florida<n><n>### Response:		James went to the best steakhouses outside of the South, but he did not go in any of the states of Texas, Michigan, Florida, or dairy farm.  Instead, he went to Florida. <n><n>### Justification: A: Texas -- if James went to the beststeakhouse outside the South, he could not simultaneously travel to Texas. This is a direct contradiction because the steakhouses outside the South do not need to be in Texas; in fact, he cannot travel to Texas in this scenario because he just left Texas for Florida.<n>B: Michigan -- James visited The best steakhouse in Michigan is in Detroit, but this steakhouse does not have to be the best steakhouse out of  the entire South. The question asks James is in a state other than the South, but in Michigan if he's already in the South.<n>C: Michigan -- if James went to a steakhouse in Michigan and left Michigan for Florida, then he would be going twice in the same location (e.g. Florida) within the span of one day. The question asks if he's in a state other than Michigan, so if he has already gone to Michigan, the question doesn't apply to this scenario. Florida is an acceptable state since it's not in the South.<n>D: Michigan -- the question states to find the best steakhouses other than the South. Therefore, if he goes to Michigan, he can only go to that steakhouse then leave for Florida and travel elsewhere. Because of this, he can only go in one state and therefore the answer must be Florida.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What is a fast but expensive way to send small cargo?

Choices:  A: trunk B: drawer C: suitcase D: book shelf E: washing machine<n><n>### Response:		<n>I believe that answer C: suitcase is the best answer. In my experience, people typically use a suitcase when traveling or storing various belongings to protect them from dust and pests. Therefore, someone is likely to find old clothing within a suitcase while they are completing these tasks.

Choices:  A: come home B: airplane C: learn from each other D: go out E: make art<n><n>### Response:		<n>**Answer:**<n><n>> A: come home<n><n>### Response Explanation:<n>In the prompt from Task 1, it asks about where you could find plumbing that wouldn't help you quench your thirst. The question is asking the types of plumbing systems or objects that provide drinkable water, as per the theme of not being of use to a person if they are thirsty. We know that plunging pipes in your home (D) and drinking machines are both examples of plumbing that are not likely to be of much use when you're thirsty. It also can mean the kinds of plumbing that provide drinkable water (and not something else, like sewage).<n>

Choices:  A: entertainment B: neat C: happy D: intoxicating E: illegal<n><n>### Response:		In this case, the question is asking about the purpose or quality of marijuana, rather than its legal status or possession of it.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. If the purpose was to consume the marijuana, the response would be A: entertainment. For if the user is happy, or entertained, they can then feel relaxed from the effects of the marijuana.<n>2. Another purpose or benefit of marijuana is B: neat (or clean); this option would be best because it involves the quality of the drug rather than the possession of it or the legal status.<n>3. If legal status was the question, the answer would be in the category of either D: illegal (marijuana is not legal in all states) or E: intoxicating (if the drug is being used to get high, it becomes illegal). <n>4. If the response had been intoxicating and marijuana was illegal, that would mean that the user was breaking the law, and would not involve any other option than A: illegal. <n>5. If D: illegal were used, marijuana would then be defined as illegal, and not simply its use, which would then not need to use the word intoxicating.<n>6. Therefore, the answer would have to be D: illegal and not A: entertainment, B: neat or C: happy. <n><n>### Response(2): In this case, the marijuana can not be defined by entertainment, neat or happy, but is only legally defined as it is illegal.

Is a company going to reveal information that they haven't previously disclosed? Is a company going to disclose more information that they hadn't previously disclosed before? Or, is the company going to "tell all", meaning reveal all of the information that they have. The answer to all these questions is no, because a company does not typically "tell all".<n><n>Therefore, it can be said that the company is going public to reveal information. This is because a company is not going public with an idea or intention to go public. So, it is evident that the company is going to reveal information.

This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Who sits at the center table at a receeption? Choices:  A: restorand B: wedding party C: church basement D: corridor E: restaurant<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. The table at a reception is often the center table, as guests may seat themselves depending on the type of reception. <n>2. As wedding parties may be quite large, it may not be desirable to seat them at a central table so they may instead be seated at tables around the room<n>3. Church basements may be the center of worshiping activities, but there is no seating at many church basements and the word "center" indicates that they are looking for a table which will seat guests centered around.<n>4. The corridor is the center of a building, but not a room where a reception would be held.<n>5. The restaurant center table is more likely to be referred to as a "booth."<n>6. Therefore, the correct answer choices are A: restaurant and B: wedding party. <n><n>Answer:<n>1. A: restaurant<n>2. B: wedding party<n>

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What do you need to run after ball?

Get (D) is too specific and also assumes a person who is already playing ball has a ball. If you were looking at someone getting ready to play a game of baseball, you might ask them, What can you do to prepare to avoid getting tired? They would not need to look in the mirror before they run after a throw. They would not need to be certain they have not been eating poorly to avoid getting tired. They could also avoid getting tired at any given time before playing a game of baseball if they skip (C), but only if they skip for the right reason.<n><n>#### Reasoning<n><n>The instructions above explain that the options are A: get tired B : have legs and C: skip.<n><n>Option D: not fat, is not an acceptable response since it is not about what you need. Option E: look first, doesn't make sense for this question as the question is about being physically ready to play. So we know the options A, B, and C are more than likely good options, because B and C do not make sense in the context of the question.  Options A and B are more specific to answer this question about running. <n><n>#### Supporting Evidence<n><n>A: get tired, <n><n>    -  Is a human ability(A)<n>    -  Describes a state (getting tired)(B)<n><n>    -  Doesn't make sense in the context (D)<n><n>A: get exhausted, <n><n>    +  Is a human ability A<n>    +  Describes a state B<n><n>    -  Not an acceptable response (C)<n><n>B: have legs, <n><n>    −  Is a physical body part (A)<n>    <n>    −  Describes a physical body condition (B)<n>    <n>    +  Makes sense in the context (B)<n><n>    −  Doesn't seem appropriate (C)<n><n>#### Assumptions<n><n>It's assumed that the individual playing ball does not need to prepare a food plan for the day. I assume legs and rest are needed in order to prepare for running after a ball

The question implies that a specific style of art is being referred to. <n>2. The artist did not use many colors, they would not be well known for their east side.

If the artist was from the United States of America, option D: middle america would be an appropriate choice. But the artist isn't from middle america, so it is incorrect. <n>5. "The artist from Georgia" is grammatically incorrect, and as such cannot be considered a correct answer.<n>6. This means that when a person is beginning to work what they are not doing yet is accomplishing. So, their artwork will not be known for it's middle america countryside.<n>7. The artist is not from an area known for its east side countryside either, so option E: georgia  isn't applicable. <n>8. There are two options, A: landscape: and B: east side.

Choices:  A: conduct trial B: arrest C: bring in verdict D: pass sentence E: serve justice<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>## Input: What is a major difference in the two types of plumbing?<n>## Demonstration<n>Input: What is a major diffrence in the two types of  plumbing? Choices: A: one brings water in, the other takes it out B: one provides drinking water, the other doesn't C: one is for indoor use, the other is for outdoor use D: one is cheap, the other is expensive E: one is slow to install, the other is installed quickly<n><n>Output: A: one brings in water, the other takes it<n><n>Rationale: 1. A major difference between plumbing that brings in water and plumbing that takes water in is that the first one refers to a connection that brings water into a building, whereas the second refers to a connection that takes water out. <n><n>2. One type of plumbing may bring water in and the other takes it out, but this does not necessarily refer to the drinking water or indoor use of water - there are also pipes in place for other purposes even within the same building. For this reason, we exclude choices C and D as they do not apply to the different types of plumbing.<n>3. We also know that water fountains and own plumbing provide drinking water, which means they can be referred to as plumbing that provides drinking water - although again, it would only be for drinking, which is not the same as drinking water. <n>4.An oil refinery only has plumbing that is used for processing and refining oil, so this is not suitable as a kind of plumbing that provides water. <n>5. Water in an oil refiniery could only be used for extinguishing flames or other work purposes, but not for drinking. <n>6. Therefore, the option that matches the question most accurately is Choice A: one brings water, the other takes water.<n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What would humans do when their legs are tired?

Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer.

Choices:  A: feel pleasure B: look attractive C: compliments D: interesting experiences E: joy<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. The question is requesting information about a person who is putting on makeup. Makeup usually falls under the category of "looking great" and "looking attractive", so the person is most likely putting on makeup to look more attractive. <n>2. Additionally, the question does not require this objective to be an innate or instinctive goal but rather one that is driven by a desire for attention or aesthetic perfection.<n>3. The question does not specify that this must be the current situation but that this is the goal for future application or development.<n>4. The option choices are:  A: feel, B: interest, C: look, D: pleasurable, E: positive.<n><n>5. The options choice of B: interesting experiences is incorrect. This is a valid option if the question does not specify that the goal is to look beautiful, but it is clear that the question wants to know a goal for makeup.<n><n>6. E: joy is incorrect for the same reason, but for the option of interest, it is a correct answer.<n><n>7. This concludes the request, and the option D: attractive is the only answer that applies.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where would you find isopropol alcohol and safety glasses? Choices:  A: pub B: restaurants C: in a park D: supermarket E: chemistry lab<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>You most likely would not need isopropol alcohol while working in a chemistry lab, so the answer is supermarket (D).<n>Safety glasses are a general tool used for protection around hazards, so you could find them anywhere. However, the most logical place to find them would be the chemistry lab (E), since they are frequently used there, and this choice is the correct answer.<n><n>

Choices:  A: jungle B: bamboo grove C: australian outback D: china E: child's book<n><n>### Response:		What is the correct answer?<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>1. Option B: bambo grove is the only option that would be used when talking about a koala display, so this is the correct answer.<n>2. Option A: jungle is a wild guess as a jungle would not be associated with a koala, but with a jaguar, leopard, or tiger instead.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. Options B: Bamboo Grove and D: China are both completely uncalled for, because a panda is considered a member of the bear family, and a koala is considered a marsupial, and marsupials are neither bears nor pandas.<n>2. Option E: Children's book is incorrect, because while koalas can be referred to as a children's book character, the answer is not asking for the correct answer to that question.<n>3. Therefore, as the choices are mostly unrelated, and option B is the only plausible answer, the correct answer is B: Bambo Grove.<n>4. This may seem unrelated, but it is because the type of animal used for display is often relevant information about a museum's exhibition. <n>5. By posing this question, the author is highlighting the fact that placing a stuffed koala in a bamboo groove is a strange choice for display.<n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What do you feel from playing football?

Choices:  A: gorgeous B: handsome C: pleasing D: glorious E: pretty beautiful<n><n>### Response:		<n>  * This question is asking about the situation of a person who has finally found someone as ugly (in that they feel similar in this sense) as he is.  <n>  * We want to find out what makes this person relieved, as in what situation is the one sticking out or drawing attention not him.<n>  * Therefore we can cross out options A: gorgeous and B: handsome, as they are both attributes that would make a particular person "stick out" or draw attention to them.<n>  * Option C: pleasing is not the correct answer as this is a subjective meaning of the word "pleasing," and the question is saying this person is looking for some kind of "equality" or "balance" in the sense of ugliness. Pleasing is not necessarily ug-ly, it could also indicate good looks, and in the question it is referring to "ugliness."<n>  * Option E: pretty beautiful is incorrect as it does not add to the understanding of what makes this person feel relieved as they have finally found someone as ugly and them.<n>  * Therefore, the correct answer must be option D: glorious. The word "glorious" is actually a descriptive word in the sense of ugh-liness, meaning it takes away from the sense of beauty we associate with the word "ugly," which is what the question is implying. It is not necessary to cross out this answer as it would not have been possible to figure out the question through this answer.

Choices:  A: builders B: driver C: architect D: fall down E: tradesmen<n><n>### Response:		A builder (option A) would design a building according to the architect's plan.<n><n>### Rationale: The input suggests that a building's architect is the one who chooses what a building looks like, who decides what material it is made of etc. The final design is still dependent on the architect.<n>### Input:Where could you find a building site? Choices: 1. A: warehouse 2. B: parking lot 3. C: yard 4. D: construction<n>5. E: none of these<n>Rationale: A warehouse (1) is only needed when storing building materials, but it would not be used (or accessible) during a current building construction project. Similarly, a parking lot (2), while used for storing heavy machinery temporarily, could not be used for storage during a building site. Also, an architect (5) is not present on a building site, but he/she is likely to visit the site to supervise the project. Similarly, construction (4) might be present at a building site but not necessarily used for storing building supplies. The answer is B in this case: parking lot.<n><n>### Input:"The word choice" is the subject of the sentence below.The word choice implies that the person speaking of it has made a choice. What is/are the word choice(s)?<n><n>An important word choice or two is how we describe our feelings. Words like 'bored', 'angry,''sad,'  'upset,' can often be used to describe too many emotions to be exactly accurate. Instead, use words that express more specific emotions.<n><n>### Response:"Feelings" and "words" are the subject.<n><n>### Comments:<n>The following is a very good example of how to write an efficient and effective sentence. Both the topic and the subject of a sentence should be identified correctly.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:The man on the street corner was showing off a wristwatch, he was trying to what it for drug money? Choices:  A: jewelry store B: case C: hock D: watch store E: pawn<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question asks the reader to identify the intended function of the item being sold in a street market. Option A: jewelery store does not meet the description, and option B: pawn is not a word. Option C: hock is a word that does not meet the description as it is not an item being sold. Option D: watch store does not meet the criteria as it is more of a general description than a specific action. The correct answer is option E: pawn, as it identifies a location where an item such as a wristwatch can be sold for quick money.<n><n>### Input:"She is still sleeping with her eyes open." What is she displaying? Choices: A: irritation B: distraction C: disrespect D: fatigue E: sleep<n><n>### Response<n>The sentence "She is still sleeping [verb]... [subject]" is a statement. Given a verb and a subject the answer will correspond directly with the subject. The subject in the answer will correspond to the person in the question, whereas the verb answers how the person is feeling. This means that if we know the answer includes a verb, we can eliminate each answer which does not include a verb or the verb does not represent a feeling. <n>A: irritation and B: disrespect indicate an action or quality of the person. Since these indicate a possible action towards the person, they cannot represent a feeling. C: fatigue is an incorrect answer, because it is an action or quality of sleep and not an emotion. D: sleep would indicate the subject is asleep. However, the question clearly indicates the subject is not asleep. The correct answer is E: sleep as the subject shows this quality. The question is asking how the person feels, and an object can only represent subjective feelings.<n><n>### Response:"I feel like I'm getting sick." What would best replace the bolded word? Choices:<n>A: sick B: I feel that C: sick D: am sick E: am I sick F: I'm sick<n><n>### Instructions:Replace the bolded word with an answer which is a feeling, not an action, not a quality, and not an object that belongs to the subject.<n><n>### Answer:"I feel [Feeling]."<n>

Choices:  A: vessel B: box C: transistor D: submarine E: lamp<n><n>### Response:		<n>![Base Radio](base_radio.png)<n><n>### Rationales: 1: Although there are several types of radios, these are primarily limited to A: vessel, B: box and C: transistor.<n>2: This choice doesn't make sense because you are referring to a radio to reach base not a phone. I assume the question is a trick question because the box (B) is used for radios.<n>3: This doesn't make sense at all since you refer to a submarine which is not related to this topic except submarines are radio devices.<n>4: This doesn't even make any sense. These devices are used to bright.

Choices:  A: eyes B: biology laboratory C: shower stall D: old cheese E: decaying matter<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationales: 1: The question is asking for fungus growing on something that is made of milk. 2: We know from the choices that milk, cheese, and shower stalls are all made from milk. Therefore, if we find fungus there, it has something to do with the milk from those items. 3: The choices E: decaying matter and D: old cheese are incorrect because fungus only grows on dead/decayed matter and doesn't grow on the cheese itself. Hence, the answer choice has to be F. - - - - - 4: A: eyes is not an option because in this case, the eyes would be used to see the matter on which the fungus has grown, not actually the fungus. So, we can rule it out. 5: B: biology laboratories would be incorrect because there are no fungi in a biology laboratory, only bacteria. 6: C: shower stalls is not accurate, as there are no fungi inside of shower stalls. 7: E: Decaying matter is not an option because there is fungi around dead/ decaying matter and inside it, not in between it. 8: D: Old cheese is false because there is no fungus growing inside of cheese. <n>9: The answer to this question would be C: Fungi growing between two blocks. <n>

We are looking for a method of transportation in which a metal rod isn't used. We know the metal rod would be an unwanted distraction in a plane or on a broken bone, so we can rule those out.<n>2. Shops (C) often involve metal rods and tools so we cannot choose that as the correct answer.<n>3. Therefore, engine (E) is an appropriate choice as it cannot be involved.

Choices:  A: race track B: populated areas C: the desert D: apartment E: roadblock<n><n>### Response:		Demonstration complete.<n>Rationales: The first thing to do is determine the key point of the question: Sammy. The next thing is determine what Sammy wants to do: go somewhere. We must now determine which of those things is being asked. Since I cannot determine whether Sammy is talking about his actions or his location, I cannot determine whether the question is asking about where Sammy wants to go (the place), or the resultant state Sammy will be in when he's arrived (going or arrived). Once I can understand what the question is asking, it's easy to determine that we're looking for where, rather than what state he'll be in. Then, I know what part of the question I am answering. Therefore, the choice "D: apartment" is incorrect, as the word 'where' isn't in that choice. The next choice on the list "E: roadblock" is incorrect, because the context of the question doesn't involve a roadblock. The word "the people" is telling us more about where Sammy needs to go, rather than what place he needs to go. For that reason, "C: populated areas" is incorrect, as well, since it implies he's talking about more people. Since we've already determined that the answer can't start with the word "where", and since this choice can, this is why "B: race track" and "A: race track" are incorrect answers. So, our answer is "where people are," or "where the people are." <n><n>### Input (same as above):Sammy wanted to go where the people were. Where might he go?

This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where is a business restaurant likely to be located?

He would die if he didn't find some way to stop what? Choices:  A: loss of heat B: revenge C: expansion D: relaxation E: calm down<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: How could one have a funeral that was the opposite of a gathering? Choices: <n>1. A: a celebration B: a party C: a rave D: a wake E: an open-casket funeral <n>Rationales:<n>1. The phrase is very specific in the description of a funeral, so no option can be ruled out as an incorrect answer. <n>2. The phrase mentions that a funeral is the opposite of a gatherings, so the options that we can eliminate are any that do not involve gatherings. <n>3. As a gathering typically involves the concept of meeting with others, 1: a celebration, and 4: a rave do not work. <n>4. Since a wake (5) is when family and friends visit with the body of the person who died, it may be considered to be associated with a larger community of people rather than a smaller group, which would not necessarily indicate gathering as the phrase suggests. <n>5. Option 3: an open casket funeral could involve people viewing the body of the person, but would not necessarily involve gathering since people are generally not interacting in any way, rather they are simply standing and looking at a body. <n>6. This leaves us 2: a party and 6: a fun, which both can involve gathering larger groups of people, thus being the correct answers. As the question is asking specifically for opposites of gathering, neither 5: an open casket or 7: a calm down are the appropriate answers. One could argue that either option, because they relate back to gathering could be correct however, a party (2) is the most correct answer as it is the most obvious, because it contains the words people in the meaning of a party, as in people gathering.<n>Answer: 2: A party and 6: A fun<n><n>### Input If a pizzeria had a free pizza for a 6:00 closing time, do the manager and employees have too make up 25 free pizzas by 7:00 o'clock?

Choices:  A: hospital B: head C: sick person D: elderly person E: doctor's office<n><n>### Response:		<n> <n>### The answer: D. The choice E: doctor's offices is incorrect because the choice indicates that an ill or sick person contracts illness in doctor office.<n><n>### The choice D: elderly person was incorrect because the answer does not specifically mention the age of an ill or a sick person. Although an elderly person could be ill or sick, an elderly person has a wide range of ages.<n><n>### Conclusion: To get an illness an individual does not need to be in Doctor's Office, he/she can contract illness in any place/surroundings where in he/she is not properly protected from germs and bacteria or proper ventilation is not provided. The choice that correctly states this is B: sick people because sick people cannot contract illness in a place where sufficient ventilation is provided as they themselves are source of bacterias.<n><n>

Choices A: true B: false<n><n>### Response<n>When visiting a park, one can generally eat an apple without a major problem. However, there are some limitations regarding how you would be able to eat the entire apple without any problems. For instance, in the case of an outdoor park that contains large amounts of sand and dirt, it is possible that someone's clothing might get dirty by touching the apple or eating bits of it. Additionally, if someone were to eat an entire apple then it is unlikely that they could find a piece of apple with which to wrap. To solve this problem, someone could bring their phone along, and they could take photos or selfies throughout the park before eating their apple which are taken from the left and then the right side as well as up into the sky. They will look great if they are wearing clothes that make them stand out from everyone else at the park, such as bright colors or patterns or even bright colors on someone else's clothes!<n><n>### Input Demonstration: What are three of our senses?

Choices:  a: eating healthy b: going to the gym c: eating at home d: working out at home e: restructuring your daily schedule to include more exercise<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Rationales: In my interpretation, the question is asking for which is more important: going to the gyn, working out at home, or restructuring your daily routine to include more exercise. Since we only have "eating healthy" here as an option, I am assuming the question is not about what is more important for eating healthy.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. Eating is a verb, so it's incorrect here.  <n>2. You can't go to the gin on its own, you have to take it to the gym.  <n>3. You have to eat there first then go in order for this to be correct.  <n>4. You can't workout at home since it's the verb for exercising.  <n>5. Also, restructuring your daily time to include more exercise can be done outside of the gym. So, this one doesn't fit the question<n>6. It's the same as 2, but is stated differently<n>7. The point of the question is to decide which is more important between the gym and restructuring. You can't restructure from the gym! <n>8. Therefore, it must be restructuring, since going to the gym is only a step to restructuring, and not restructuring by itself.<n>9. Therefore, option e: reststructure your daily routine to include exercise<n>Answer: e: restructure your daily routine to incude exercise<n><n>### Input2: Where are you most likely to find a person that enjoys collecting stamps? <n>a: A local library <n>b: the beach <n>c: a stamp convention <n>d: a post office <n>e: a train tracks <n><n>### Response2:  c: stamp convention <n><n>input:Where is the most probable location in the United States to find someone that enjoys collecting wine?A:A.Wine cellarsB:Local wine storesC: Wine distributorshipsD:Local

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5.

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Jamie wanted to reduce her waist size, but all of her efforts failed miserably.

The key information is that John and James spend most of their time communicatipng, they are slowed down because the communication slows them or takes up a majority of their time.  <n>I believe the answer is: E - Collaboration, because the answer has to be something that communicating has a negative impact on. Communicative, is only in the sentence for emphasis.<n><n>The collaboration I think is the negative effect because I have a feeling the rest were going to include information. With my answer I can explain that they slowed their collaboration.<n><n>#### Instructions: Is this solution optimal and efficient?

Choices:  A: ocean B: symphony C: band D: music store E: music shop<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is C: Band because the band is composed of many different musicians, and it's likely that one of them will be playing the cello.<n><n>### Discussion:<n>Because a "band" is an informal group of musicians, it doesn't necessarily indicate a specific number of people. Additionally, the word "band" is often used to refer to a type of music, rather than a specific group of people. Therefore, it's safe to assume that any group of musicians could potentially include someone playing the celli.<n>To answer the question, we need to consider the context and what information is being requested.<n>In this case, we're asked which group of musicians is most likely to include someone playing the celo. Since a "symphony" is a highly formal and structured type of music, it's unlikely that someone playing the cell will be in that group. Additionally, an "ocean" is an informal term used to refer vaguely to the sea, so it doesn't make sense that someone playing the cello would be in that group.<n>The answer to the question, then, is that an informal group of musical people, such as a "band," is the most likely to include someone who plays the cello.<n>

It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

Choices:  A: resting B: sleep more C: bed sores D: missing out E: comfort<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Rationale(s): You made a fair attempt at figuring this out, but the only possible answer is: C – bed sores. The word "sick" and the reason why she's "staying in bed" implies she must be sick. The only things she's not doing are "sleeping more" and "missing out", but sleeping and missing out is not a noun, therefore those choices can't appear in the blank. "Comfort" is not a noun either, but is a verb. Therefore, the only possible noun option is bed sores.<n><n>### Input:"You gotta know when to fold 'em!" What can be folded?

(A: Yes, B: No, C: Some animals like it!)

Choices:  A: child's hand B: the last straw C: hobby shop D: end of line E: toy store<n><n>### Response:		<n>This question is asking for the appropriate answer that answers the question that she lost her kite because **[she] wasn't** careful.<n>### Rationales<n>- She thought there was more string to make up for the lost kite, but it slipped **from** her fingers when she reached for **the** what.<n>- Sally has lost her kite because of her carelessness, and therefore the spool that she was holding slipped from her fingers. Therefore, we can reason that the "what" was the spool and Sally was trying to reach for it. <n>- It wasn't the child's hand that slipped from her fingers since when she was trying to reach for the spool it wasn't from a child's hand.<n>- The last straw: this means the final limit of the spool will fall down when there is no more wind, so  it doesn't make sense to have these words in the sentence.<n>-Hobby shop: She was holding the kite while standing in the hobby shop but Sally's carelessness costed her her kite. This option doesn't relate to the spool of string from her kite so the answer is incorrect.<n>-End of line: It didn't make sense if Sally lost her kite from end of line.<n>-Toy store: it wasn't that she was standing in the toy store and slipped, but Sally tried to grab the spool but slipped.<n><n>Answer:D: end of line<n><n><n>### Input:: Which of the following is not a fruit?

They sell and install carpet in houses. 2: B: Ace Hardaway - They sell some type of flooring  including carpet. The question asked 'where' and 'when you're in need' is only asking for one, so the answer isn't Ace Hardawy 3: C: Walmart - Walmart sells flooring, and possibly carpet and even rugs, which may need cleaned or repaired. However, they are not a carpet store, and are not specifically focused on carpet. D: Carpet Depoth - Carpet Depot sells carpet. The question asks 'where' and 'in need', so Carpet Depot is too specific. 4: E: Sears - Sears offers a wide variety of stuff that has some connection with the carpet question. They sell some carpet, but they sell a lot more.

What is this an example of? Choices:  A: park B: coloring book C: garden center D: math problem E: gravity<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. You can plug in the correct answer, 7 apples and see if it's correct or not. <n>2. However, if B is the answer, then that would mean that 3 falls off is an apple that is already on the ground. We can't assume the apple fell off the tree, it can also be the apple on the ground now. In that case, this question is asking for the correct answer for the scenario before 3 falls off and we can choose from the 7 apples after the apple fell off. <n>3. As an alternative, you could also ask for how much fell off to reach this conclusion, for some reason there's a typo in the answer choices. <n>4. We can determine this is garden center, because we know that a park is an artificial place, like a garden center is a garden which is made of ground.

Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

Choices: <n>A: Gas station B: City C: London D: Train station E: Airport<n>Rationales:1. The question asked about where there are more telephone booth to not the telephone book. The question asked about telephone booths.<n>2. Gas station (A) sells gasoline in canisters and in pumps, so it would be unlikely to find a phone booth there. City (C) doesn't mention anything about telephones. <n>3. London (D) was referenced to describe the city as a whole because there wouldn't be any individual telephone booths located in the city's centre (C). Train stations (E) could perhaps have telephone booths, but generally speaking they are more suited for calling trains and other employees. <n>4. Therefore, the best choice is B: city. As cities have a large number of people and telephone booths are useful for communicating with them, there are more telephone book in cities.<n><n>### Input1: In which of these could you find a lighthouse?

While a gas station (B) can have the tools necessary to repair a lighthouse, that doesn't mean they provide lighthouses. <n>4. The city (C) could have a water source, as cities sometimes have fountains and refineries.<n>5. A house (D) should also be ruled out since only a small amount of time would be spent maintaining the lighthouse. Therefore, the best

It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where would you play a board game with your family?

Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Simon bought a cow because he wanted to put it to work.   He didn't want any meat for it.  Where might Simon be taking the cow? Choices:  A: countryside B: city C: dairy farm D: butcher shop E: canada<n><n>### Response:		 A: counrtyside<n><n>### Rationales: 1 The question asks where Simon would be taking the cow. This implies he doesn't want the cow for food or meat.<n>2. If Simon wanted to put the cow to work, it would have to be in a place where the cow would have food. <n>3. So, the cow must be for productive work, which would mean a farm or dairy. <n>4. Butcher shop and canada are misleading because these imply meat production and consumption. <n>5. City or countryside could be appropriate answers, but neither is as logical as cow on a dairy farm or butcher shop.<n><n>

A person who is working to become an adult may have the same goal as those not working to become an<n>adult. So, A: want success is a wrong answer.<n>2. A person who is not working to become an adul may also go to school. This will be the case when he or she is going to school to learn the skills needed for his future work. So, B: go to school can give a wrong answer.<n>3. A person who is both working to become an adult and going to school may also avoid trouble when he is young.<n>This option can give a wrong answer on the basis that a person who is working to be an adult must be also be going to school. So, C: avoid trouble may be a wrong answer.<n>4. A person who is only working may not have the same answer as someone not working to become<n>an adult. We may ask: "Why does not someone who is only working have any goal to become an adult?"<n>The answer is : this person does not have any goal to be an adult when he is an adult. He also does not have any goal of being an adult. And, finally, he also does not have any idea about becoming an adult.<n>5. Option E: be an adult can also be a wrong answer because becoming an adult is a goal to become an adult.

Choices:  A: fairy tale B: castle C: middle ages D: chess board E: doll house<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationale<n><n><n><n>### Input A: Fairy Tale<n><n>Input: Where is the small knight likely to found? 2. Where could you find a small knight? Choices: 1. A: Fairy tale 2. B: Castle 3. C: middle ages 4. D: Chess board 5. E: Doll house<n>The small knight is typically found in a fairy tale, as this is where they are typically from. <n>Castles are often described as settings for epic tales, like a setting for a story of some war-like hero. <n>The middle is described as the "middle ages" which describes a period of time, not a place. <n>Chess boards are objects on which chess is played. <n>A doll house would most certainly not describe a place a small knight would be found. <n><n>### Rationales<n><n>1. The first sentence in the question is unclear about where specifically the small knight could be found. The question could be referring to something more generic where "knights" could be found, or it could be specifying a particular place, with the word "found" modifying "fairy" as a title, and the word "this" referring to a fairy tale. <n>1. This type of reference is typical of writers and speakers when referring to a place that the listener is familiar with, so they use a more specific example to illustrate the broader point. <n>2. When a listener is familiar with the thing being talked about, it allows them to fill in the blanks between the words and form a more specific idea in their head about the type of place being described. <n>3. Fairy tales are typically fantastical and typically not part of this world. In this context, a fairy tale could be anywhere where "knights" would be able to be found. <n>4. In short, the fairy tale is the type of place where one could find a "small knight". Therefore, A: Fairy tale. <n><n>## Inferences<n><n>**_Use the template below to make additional inferences._**<n><n>### Inference A: Small knights are likely to be more familiar in fairy tales than in any of the other available choices. <n><n>## Discussion<n><n>Here is an additional prompt for discussion of this

The eye of the cave<n><n>### Response –<n><n>If a person’s eyes are their window to their soul, then their soul is in their mind, not their body. The body is a physical part of a person. Thus, I don’t see what any of this has to do with a room they would be most comfortable in? Therefore, the most logical answer is:<n>If they are comfortable in a room, this would be in their mind, and therefore, it is not connected to their soul. This has nothing to do with the soul, which is located in the mind, not the body.<n><n>The question is asking for a physical place where a person would feel the most comfortable. “Eye of the Cave” may be the metaphorical and symbolic significance, but that has nothing to do with actual physical places.

However, the phrase "eye of the soul" doesn't really lend itself to a physical room or a place that would hold any physical aspect of your soul. This phrase has more to do with the connection you feel in a certain area, or the emotional connection to a particular place. <n>The way that we normally use the phrase, "the window to someone's soul" refers to how someone looks and expresses themselves.

Choices:  A: liberal B: heretical C: recalcitrant D: conservadox E: heretical<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: The Priests pushed for more orthodox behaviours because orthodox refers to how things are supposed to be done. Heresy indicates unorthodox (against how things are supposed to done) behavior.<n><n>### Input and Rationales:<n><n>#### Response:<n>1. The choice has to be the answer to the original question since the question is why the priest was pushing for more orthodox behavior.<n>2. We need to find the correct answer for what kind of behavior the priest pushed for. <n>3. It would make sense that the behavior in question would be heretical since heresy indicates unorthoed behavior (that which goes against what is supposed to be done, in this case, orthodox). <n>4. We know that there can't be heretical orthodox behavior, so option B: heretical is the answer.<n>5. Option C: recalcitant means to be stubborn or difficult to change. This isn't an accurate representation of what the question is asking. <n>6. Option D: conservadox, which refers to being conservative and eccentric has nothing to do with this question. <n>7.

This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What might someone want to be if he or she is thick? Choices:  A: slender B: free flowing C: sparse D: unacquainted E: diet<n><n>### Response:		A slender person would be an acceptable answer here, although not the correct answer, due to the fact that the adjective "thick" is used negatively to indicate being plump or obese. <n><n>### Input : If you were planning to visit a city and its population was more than 2 million, what might make your visit less stressful? Choices: <n>     <n>   			A: a comfortable hotel B: a place with a lot of restaurants and clubs C: a place where English is widely spoken D: enough money to travel around E: a high public transit rate to move around the city <n><n><n>**Correct Answer : D: enough money to move around the city (the more stress you have in life, the more mental energy you have to spend worrying about things you can't control. Having less money to make that trip could be stressful but choosing a hotel that's comfortable, having easy access to restaurants and clubs, etc, will be less stressful)**<n><n>### Input What is an alternate name for the state of New York? Choices: 	A: Pennsylvania B: Connecticut C: Florida D: Georgia E: Florida<n><n>### Rationale: Florida and Georgia are U.S. states, while the rest are the names of cities or localities within New York state. <n><n>##Input: Name something that is not good for you.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What is made out of only one piece? Choices:  A: jigsaw puzzle B: chess game C: puzzle box D: jigsaw puzzel puxxle E: puxxle<n><n>### Response:		<n>There is no correct answer to this question.<n><n>## Solution:<n><n>1. To solve this question, first make assumptions about the answer choices. For example, a jigsaw puzzle (A) needs lots of little pieces and is more complex. A chess game (B) is more complicated and requires a lot of pieces. A puzzle box (C) and a jigsaw puzzal puuxle (E) would both need different pieces. A jigsaw puzzal box (D) just seems to repeat the question.<n><n>2. Now look at the question and determine the answer choices that could possibly be correct, given the question.<n><n>     So there are three options that could be correct: a jigsaw puzzel puuxle, a jigsaw puuxle box, and a jigsaw puxxle puzzle.<n><n>3. The answer would be D a jigsaw puzzol puuxle.<n><n>4. We can rule out the other answers because we can deduce that the answer choice must contain a jigsaw puzzlu box. A jigsaw puuxl puxxle or a puuxle jigsaw puxxl do not begin with a jigsaw puxul box, so these are not the answer.<n><n>5. A jigsaw box puxlu puzzle (B) doesn't seem correct, because it does not only mean that the jigsaw puzzlu puxlu is made out of one piece. Another way to write this answer is to state that it is impossible to make a jigsaw box out of only one piece.<n><n>5. In this case, the correct answer is D a jigsaw puuuls puxxle, because only the last part of the answer requires that a jigsaw puul box be made out of one piece, and everything else is not needed to answer the question.<n>

Choices:  A: jail time B: fear C: going to prison D: nothing E: feeling of guilt<n><n>### Response:		<n>[Congratulations! You are correct! What happens to the conscience of another who has been caught commiting a murder is that they feel guilt. This is correct response because the question is posed 'what happens to the conscience of a person who has been caught commuting a murder'. What is the meaning of conscience. The definition of conscience is an inner feeling or voice viewed as acting as a guide to the rightness or wrongness of one’s action. A murder is a bad action but the question says a murdwr. Therefore, the actions of the question is not a right or wrong action according to the definition. However, a crime as it is a violation of the law is the right or wrongful action. In the question we understand that the murder is bad and the response it is the act of right or wrong according to the defnition of conscience. Feeling a sense of guilt is the right or wrong action so this is the correct answer to the queston 'What happens to the conscience' of a person who has committed committing a murder][Response for this question in response 3]<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following fill in the blank question with word pair that you think is a fit.<n><n><n>### Instructons:Answer the following fill in the blanks question with word pair that  you think is a fit<n><n>### Incorrect Response:  the answer to this question is A:'mandatory' and B: 'compelled'.

Choices:  A: library B: study area C: table D: classroom E: shelf<n><n>### Response:		When a person is using a computer, they probably will not need to store files. Instead, a person typically opens files or folders to access them. This behavior would be different for paper files, which would require a place to store them until they are needed or discarded. However, if a person is using an electronic dictionary, they presumably already have it stored somewhere on their computer. The question, then, is looking for where they would put a file (dictionary) that was already on their computer while they were using it. <n><n>Rationales:<n>1. "Library" would not make sense, since a dictionary would likely not be necessary for studying in a library. <n>2. "Table" would not make sense because a dictionary is a single electronic file, not a large pile of files. Therefore, placing a single file on a table seems inconclusive.<n>3. "Classroom" would not make sense unless multiple dictionaries were needed for classroom activities, but single dictionaries could be easily stored on a shelf. There are no specifics given about classroom activities that would mandate storing them there either. <n><n>### Instructions:<n>When does a person most need a dictionary?<n><n>### Submit your solution to this problem.<n><n>### [Your turn!](/lessons/48187)<n><n>18. When a person doesn't know the meaning of a word, they should look it up in a dictionary.<n>19.

There are a few different types of dictionaries.  The type of dictionary you need depends on what kind of dictionary you are looking for and what you want to use the dictionary for.<n>22. The type of dictionary you can use depends on what kind of word you are looking for.  There are two types of dictionary: 1)A monolingual dictionary and 2)A bilingual dictionary.  A bilingual dictionary will be a 2-language dictionary which contains words from both.<n>23. A monolingual dictionary will be a dictionary that does not contain words from both.  If you are looking for what word mean in English or Spanish, you should use a bilingual dictionary.<n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What cuisine is joked about eating small dogs? Choices:  A: backpack B: dog show C: chinese food D: french E: good hands<n><n>### Response:		<n>##### Rationales:<n>1. The question is referencing a joke about eating smaller dogs, not backpacks or french cuisine. <n>2. The joke would make no sense in French since there are no dogs associated with their culinary culture so its not D: french food <n>3. The dog show would be a place to go on a walk with a dog that would be eaten. However, the dog show is a real thing, so you wouldn't joke about eating dogs unless the food is extremely delectable. It's not D: good hands. This is because good hands is a slang term meaning 'I have money' (not related to dogs).  <n>4. This question is clearly asking about dogs in cuisine, which would of course involve eating dogs in China or France but you'd probably be more familiar with eating small dogs in American cuisine. The joke would say something like 'the chinese really like to eat small dogs' which would be incorrect. Therefore, the joke is talking about eating small dogs and not food from either China or France. So the answer is C: Chinese food<n><n>### Input : What is the word's counterpart for "Duck of Woods?"<n>1.

Because the show was about a single flower show, it was not an anthology series.<n><n>### C: A dull read refers to the person who is writing the show.

Choices:  A: build family together B: fall in love C: make love D: complete E: distance themselves<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I believe that a lover is likely to want to do all of the following:<n><n>- Make love (D)<n>- Complete (E)<n>- Fall in love (C)<n>- Build a family (A)<n>- Distance themselves (B)<n><n>### Justify:<n>As a lover, your desire is to have love with your partner for you and your family to live a happy, healthy life. So, you are likely to want to do one of a few things: <n><n>- Make love: This is a physical act which signifies your love is unconditional, so you are likely to want and pursue this. <n>- Complete: You would want to provide and maintain your family as much as possible, which involves completing some things such as completing home projects and finishing errands so your S.O can enjoy their free time with family. <n>- Fall in love: This is the act of starting a romantic relationship with someone where the desire is to be with them for an extended period of time. <n>- Build a family: This is the process of raising a family, which requires an understanding of the individual, the person you love, as well as yourself. This way you can determine what needs to be done in order for the romantic partnership to remain successful, both in raising a family and developing a relationship.<n>- Distance itself: While this is a verb, it would mean that you would want to remove some space between you and your partner. This should not be confused with "distance oneself", a phrase which typically refers to a relationship or group that is no longer compatible and desires to separate. <n><n>Therefore, we can conclude that a lover is most likely to want to do B, C, D, and E. If the only verbs were complete (E) and distance oneself (B), I may have said more like A, D, E, and B. This is because the only thing missing that you may not have thought about was building a family. It's not something we all do, so it may not be obvious at first. Additionally, the choice A may feel awkward because people nowadays may consider "family" and "love" different things. "Completed family" is used now, but completing something, especially a family, indicates you're already in a romantic relationship.<n><n>### Additional Supports:

An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What does a person looking for new things in life do? Choices:  A: become depressed B: welcome change C: thank god D: experiences E: pay bills<n><n>### Response:		The question is asking someone who is looking for new things in their life. We should not be depressed, welcome change, or pay bills.<n><n>### Logic: One might experience welcome change in life when they open themselves to different possibilities. Alternatively, paying bills can be a way you maintain a balance in your life. However, these types of experiences and feelings wouldn't typically be a result of a person who is actively or intentionally looking for new things in themselves. <n><n>### The correct answer then, is A: become depressed. This may seem an odd or unexpected answer, but one of the most important facets of personal growth and development is self-awareness. If someone is actively seeking opportunities for personal change, they are probably more likely to realize that they are not being happy and fulfilled. If this is the case, they should be able to appreciate experiencing depressive feelings. <n>

A train station will be filled with many possible choices, but a bookstore isn't the right answer because bookstores sell books, not magazines. A newsstand usually deals with magazines, but they are not exactly your typical transport transport waiting room.

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:How can an artist commemorate a horse forever.

It wants to play and be amused. It wants to be given the opportunity to meet new people, to sniff everyone, and maybe even taste something. It also wants to eat some food and drink some water. It wants to be petted by children. It wants to be held by adults. The dog doesn't care about any of the trivial details; it wants to be happy and carefree and have everything made simple for it, as though it's at home.<n><n>A dog wants a lot at a party. It wants to be happy and, perhaps more importantly, for everyone else to be happy. If I gave a dog at a party all that it desires, he wouldn't know how to react; the dog doesn't expect people to give in to its whims at the party so it's not trained to accept the behavioral implications of its desires.<n><n>### Input(question) : What happens when you step on your own shadow?<n><n>### What happens when you step onto your own shadow?<n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Dancing for a long time will lead you to become what? Choices:  A: sore B: intercourse C: fatigue D: become tired E: expression<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Input: Dancing for a long time can leave you sore (b), fatigued (e), or tired (d). These are common occurrences after dancing for any duration of time. So, these options are invalid. <n><n>However, a more common occurrence after dancing for any length of time is the expression of emotion resulting from such a demanding and entertaining activity. <n>A possible alternative of your answer is that you would become tired and then become sore, though becoming sore would be common after long periods of dancing even without tiredness. <n><n>The correct final answer is A: sore. <n>Answer: A: sore.<n><n>### Input A: When you see a car, what are you most likely to consider? A list of options will appear.<n><n>### Response<n><n>Sight is one of our primary senses and a car is a sight, so when you see a car you'll most likely consider what it is. As a result, you will consider it's shape, size (i.e. a 4x4), whether it has a top (i.e. convertible) etc.<n><n>Input B:<n><n>You won't be able to see inside of a car when you are sighting it. What will you consider instead?<n><n>The correct answer is that you'll consider if it has air conditioning, a stereo, etc. If you can't see inside a car, you'll need to focus on things that you generally find inside of cars.<n><n>Input C:<n><n>Where are sports cars usually made?<n><n>Input D:<n><n>What does a sports car look like?  <n>

He hadn't gotten what he needed in a long time.  He was suffering from what? Choices:  A: addiction B: fatigue C: relaxation D: headaches E: over eating<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Demonstraion:<n>Input: How did the monkey help the other? Choices: 1. The monkey was kind, 2. Monkey helped out, 3. Monkey was angry, 4. Monkey did nothing at all, 5. Monkey gave things away<n>Rationales:<n>1. It is unlikely that the monkey would have helped the bear out of the kindness of his heart, since this was a task requested of him and the monkey would have had every reason to refuse, which means it's not an example of kindness.<n>2. It seems equally unlikely that the monkey gave away things that weren't actually his.<n>3. The monkey was angry at the bear for asking him to do so much work, which is an emotion associated with angry actions.<n>4. It also doesn't make sense that the monkey would help just for no reason at all. There's no context to explain why he would have helped out.<n>5. Finally, the answer can't be that the bear helped out since it's asking who helped the other, not who helped the monkey.<n>Therefore, the best answer is option 3: the monkey was angry.

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where is a microphone boom likely to be covering a stock market event?

An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Sally was a senior in the House.  What might she be a member of? Choices:  A: assisted living facility B: old people's home C: high school or college D: republican party E: organization<n><n>### Response:		D: republican party<n><n>### Rationales:1. The question is specifically asking what Sally might be a member of. <n>2. "House" is referring to the US House of Representatives. <n>3. Sally is in her senior year because she is a member of the senior class. <n>4. So, we can infer that Sally is probably in high school if she's considered a member of the senior "class". <n>5. Option A: assisted living home isn't a good choice because Sally is not elderly, thus she wouldn't need or be a member of senior facilities. <n>6. Option B: old people' s home is an adjective phrase that is describing a "house", which wouldn't be applicable for the subject of the question. 7. Option C: high school or a D: republican party are the only good options according to our information. A: High school or college: doesn't apply because the answer is senior class (Sally is a senior in high school). <n>8. B: old people' (s) home: Adjective phrase describing "old people's home" which isn't appropriate because "House" is already referring to the people this is about. <n>9. C: high school or D: republican party: Sally is a Senior class representative at her school, but she isn't a member of the republican party. Thus, E: organization is the correct answer.<n>Answer: D republican party<n><n><n>### Input:"Let's meet up downtown." What is probably not part of the activity? Choices: 1. A: car rentals B: parking C: cars D: driving E: trains<n><n>### Rationale: 1. The activity is meeting someone at a designated place, so the activity doesn't involve cars or driving from point to point. <n>2. If a destination is downtown, public transportation would most likely be available, and not necessitate cars.<n>3. Parking options would also be available. Cars and driving are simply not a necessary part of the activity for meeting downtown.<n>4. Therefore, the correct answer can be any of the options A: car rentals, B: parking, or D: driving. <n>5. Car rentals would be unnecessary for meeting downtown

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What do people do to pass time before they can use electronics when fly in airplane?

Choices:  a: smoke alarm b: television c: toilet d: water fountain e: show f: plumbing<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The question is about knowing if their home isn'y working/not working but they can't use these choices as an answer because they don't work without a home. <n>2. a: If a person is looking for an alarm to know if their home isn’t working, they can’t use a smoke alarm because it’s not an alarm and it’s used for a different purpose. The same goes for b: television and c: toilet.<n>3. d: Their home is a water fountain would be used for drinking water, not for a shower. <n>4. f: A plumbing leak might be the case that a person is looking for, but there are other choices to use instead. <n> <n>5. Therefore b: television and e: show would be the most likely answers. b: television suggests having things recorded to watch later on, or other shows. e: show refers to a live show rather than a recording at home.<n><n>#### Answer: b: television and e; show<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>### Demosaic: The following instruction contains several tasks that require you to write a response.

Choices:  A: sleep B: feel more comfortable C: sweating D: blush E: cuddle<n><n>### Response:		<n>```<n>Explanation: 1. The answer makes the most sense because it relates to the question's wording and intent. <n>2. She curled up under a "blanket" to get "warmer" (A), but then they "started" some type of activity that caused her to "blush" (E). <n>3. This suggests that she changed her position, which would've exposed her to the environment differently (e.g. removing the blanket), so she would feel herself warm up further, or feel the cold breeze, which made her blush. <n>4. As a result, her body temperature would rise and she would be "hot" (B). <n>5. To be "feeling comfortable" (C) would mean that she wouldn't have changed her position under the blanket and remained there. <n>6. If her body remained the same temperature, then there is no difference between hot and "hot", so she could not feel uncomfortable and comfortable.<n>7. Therefore, her body temperature would either rise to its warmest and highest state, or begin to fall before she was "comfortable". <n>8. This suggests she would eventually cool and become "cold" (D), as she started the activity, because the film, book, etc. would need some form of interaction for it to start, and that interaction would cause her body temperature to change.<n>9. This leaves "blush' as the only option that fits all the requirements. As a result, the most relevant answer is "blush".<n>10. As a side note - the answer is not blushing "as she blushed." This would not make sense grammatically.<n>```<n><n>### Input:'The last known person on this ship was you'<n><n>### Response;<n>```<n>Explanations: 1. The correct answer must be a noun as the question is asking who the last person on the ship was, and nouns describe people.<n>2. A "person" would not be fitting the grammatical patterns of the sentence since it's a plural word, meaning there would be more than one person on that ship.<n>3. Although "anyone" is a noun, it would not fit in this situation as the question asks for the last known living person, and the word anyone would imply that at least one

That meant that the only time to leave was when? Choices:  A: early morning B: day time C: night D: afternoon E: daytime<n><n>### Response:		A person's thought is a good measure of belief, and often is one's conclusion after considering evidence. When a person thought that she had been at home all evening, that usually indicates that the person had not been there, nor did she think she would have been there. This in the end points to the only time that one could have left is "the afternoon," because you would probably not consider leaving at night.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What would a person expect if they are competent in their school work? Choices:  A: compliments B: passing grade C: intellectual challenge D: sticker E: avoid pain<n><n>### Response:		It is obvious that your answer is C: intellectual challenge. Your response contains an overlapping response. Please remove all duplicate responses and post your new response.<n><n>### Review:<n>Input: I am an expert at this. Choices: A: I don't know anything about it B: I am terrible at this C: I don't like this D: I don't trust this E: I'm good at this<n>Rationales: There is obviously too many answer choices to be included in this assessment. However let's look at some of the options to see which would be best: 1. Answer choice A: I don'thave anything to do with. This is correct. <n>2. B: I am terrible and it's not my area of expertise. 2. C: I don'ttrust this. Again, yes and no. 3. D: I'm good. Maybe, I know you're quite good at things but do you know everything? Not necessarily! 4. E: I'mgood at this. Good, yes! <n>5. Therefore answer choice B: I am terrible about it would be the best choice.<n><n>### Input"When would a person tell others to expect to not get help regarding a subject? Choices:  a: when they are asking a question b: when they aren't asking for help<n>Answer: b: when they aren’tasking for help as stated in my above response.

Choices:  a) yes b) no c) i don't know d) I trust the information I am given<n><n>### Demo:<n>Input: When a new piece of information is being presented, what do you have to consider? Choices: A: whether you trust the source B: what you've seen before C: if you've seen a similar example before D: the information E: what you remember<n><n>### Rationales:<n>There would be  too many answer choices, as well as some confusing wording with the word you. So let's look at each option and what they may refer to:<n>1. Answerchoice A: whether you trustthe source 2. Answ erchoice B: what you'veseenbefor

It is common for schools to be located in residential neighborhoods or communities, but they are not always placed in these specific areas. For example, there are many schools that are on campuses, which can be very large and located in different places depending. Additionally, schools can be found in cities, but the answer to the question asked does not specify that they need to be found within a city. <n><n>### Input<n>Where could you find a park? Choices A: townhouse community B: every city C: university D: subway E: business district<n><n>### Response <n>The answer to the question is choice B: every city. This is because a park is generally found in any city that has a number of trees and an area designated for public use. It does not have to be located in a specific residential neighborhood or community. In conclusion, the answer to the question is that you can find a park in any city.<n>

Choices:  A: deadly B: dangerous C: unconcerned D: stressful E: harder when weather bad<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Instructions:What is the name of this question type?<n><n>### Tip:Use your knowledge of sentence structure to determine the word that makes sense in the context of the question. For example, if a word is being used as an adjective, it is a predicate. In this question, the word “deadly” indicates danger, hence it is describing icy roads that are dangerous and should not be driven on.<n><n>### Key points:This question type requires you to determine the predicate word and then choose the answer that makes sense given that context.<n><n>### Question:How do you know that “deadly” should be the answer?<n><n>### Answer:In the context of the question, “deadly” means "deadly: the state or quality of being dangerous or harmful" (Oxford Dictionary), hence the right answer is A: deadly. <n><n>### Questions:What is the name for an answer that makes logical sense?<n><n>### Response<n><n>### TIP:The answer that fits best with logical sense is always the right answer.<n><n>### KEY POINTS:<n><n>### This question asks you what to look for when choosing the right answer.<n>### If you look back at all three of the examples we’ve tried, it’s easy to see that every right answer was chosen because it made logical sense in the context of what was being asked.<n><n>### What are the three types of context clues?<n><n>### Context clues can be thought of as hints within a sentence that can help you when you're stuck on a confusing word.<n><n>### There are several kinds of context clues, most of which you've already seen in practice.<n><n>### Three common types of context clues include:<n><n>### One clue that is often found in the sentence is the surrounding words.<n>### If the words before or after a word give any clarification, then these are called **precedes or surrounds**.<n><n>### One common one is the definition found right next to the word or close to it in the sentence. This is the most reliable context clue and it's generally easy to use if the word is one you're expected to know.<n><n>### Using the dictionary is another way to determine the real meaning of a word.<n><n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What has happened to a person's money after he or she has used the last of it? Choices:  A: dissipate B: flown C: disintegrate D: fall apart E: penultimate<n><n>### Response:		A: dissipate<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The question mentions that the person has used the last of their money. This implies that the person has used all of it already. The end result cannot be used again, so option B: flown is excluded.<n>2. No option mentions "last of" at all. If no money is left, its already spent. The person's money cannot be disintegrating (C) because nothing is left anymore.<n>3. The sentence does not mention the amount of time between when the last of the money was used and the question's phrasing ("has happened"). This is an indication that the person might have already run out of money. In that case, the answer option D: fall apart is not suitable because there's no money to break apart.<n>4. There are no mentions of "penultimate" (E) in the context of money. If money has disappeared already, it cannot be said to be the "penultimate" stage. The most likely answer is dissipate.<n><n>Answer: A: dissipating<n><n>### Input : I had already had dinner just as Dad showed up.<n><n>### Response :  My parents were hungry, but they had already had dinner when I got home.<n><n>### Ransomes: <n><n>We have already had dinner, but I still have dinner, so I need to prepare something to eat for my parents.<n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where can you find a place to eat and places to buy items of many different kinds?

As a matter of fact, a downtown is known for all kinds of businesses. <n>3. C: own house does not have a variety of different kinds of business because in their own house they don't have any store to buy items of any kind.<n>4. The word 'town' means several small towns in which they have a variety of different kind of business.<n>5. You can get items of a variety of different kind in a city. <n>6. For example, there are many different restaurants to eat and several supermarkets, grocery stores, clothing stores, electronic stores to buy items of many kind.<n><n>### 🭕DONE🫡 **✅**<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>The plumbing could be used for other purposes, such as to cool or heat buildings, transport water, or pump sewage. This is why A, that is oil refineries, are off limits.<n><n>Resting, tiredness, and accomplishing aren't appropriate because a person can be any of those things and still be just beginning work. Therefore accomplishing is the most appropriate answer A: oil refineres.<n><n>### Difficulty level:  2 📣📣<n>

Choices:  A: cinema B: opera C: party D: stage E: dance<n><n>### Response:		<n>*You would see a performer at an event you've invited your friends to. *<n><n>*The question explicitly states that your friends aren't attending. By using the word "gathering," it implies that these are the only two possible answers. *<n><n>*Additionally, the question doesn't give a location for the event. *<n><n>*We may assume that the event is held indoors, as one place we would see a performer on stage. *<n><n>*However, in either case, the performer is not at your own home or a party or event your friends are hosting. *<n><n>*As a result, we can rule out choices C: party and E: dance as these both suggest performers would perform at a party you're hosting, or in your own home. *<n><n>*In addition, we cannot say that the event is a party, because we do not know what type of party it is, or what the name of that party is. *<n><n>*This means we can only rule out choice E: dance, as one place is a party we host as well as the event itself. *<n><n>*Therefore, we are left with choices A: cinema and B: opera.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5.

This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3.

Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7.

This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Everybody has a little bit of creativity, but only a few lucky ones get to do what for a living?

Choices:  A: supermarket B: kitchen cupboard C: table D: flea market E: dishwasher<n><n>### Response:		<n>- Rational <n>1. The question asks for the name of the place where someone bought a lot of items in preparation for the weekend. <n>2. The word "buying" suggests that the person purchased items in the past, so they need to be the kind of item bought and/or stored in a kitchen cabinet and dishwasher.<n>3. The item stored in the "flea market" is considered "old" and rare, so it is likely not something that was just bought and is already in the kitchen cabinet. <n>4. The item stored in a cabinet would typically not be in the kitchen cupboard because cupboards and cabinets are not large enough to store items, so the cabinet in use would likely be in the form of a closet.<n>5. So, the answer should be B, or kitchen cabinet. <n>The response should have all the information necessary to complete the request.<n>

Firstly, C: going to school could be classified as damage, as students frequently damage property from vandalism and other forms of delinquent behavior. <n>Alternatively, going to jail would be considered the same due to prison vandalism as well. Additionally, B: going to jay is correct because one usually goes there if they're damaging property.<n>E: going to destruction could also be classified as property damage if that destruction was intentional, such as bombing or arson. <n>Lastly, going to A: damage would be correct since that represents the most common negative outcome associated with damaging property.

He should "charmin relatives" or go to a "doctor himself" (that could be a witch doctor or something but he doesn't have the resources to pay one. <n><n>### Inputs:There has been a change in the weather, what aren't as they were before? Choices: 1. A: cloud cover 2. B: heat index 3. C: pressure 4. D: visibility 5. E: barometric pressure<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. There are many atmospheric conditions that would qualify as "weather changes" but only the two listed correspond to a meaning that is relevant when the question asks if something were as it was before the weather changed.<n>2. The answer is not heat index or pressure since none of the listed choices can be modified by humans.<n>3. Cloud cover is something that can be created by humans or changed by humans through weather modification activities. But this isn't relevant since the question asked about how weather is affected by human activity and not how it is influenced by nature.<n>4. The question isn't asking "what's changed," it's asking what isn't as it was before the change. This requires that the answer must have changed and so option Visibility (the second item listed) is not the correct answer.<n>5. Barometric pressure rises and falls all the time in accordance with human activity and the weather, so the change in barometric pressure, alone, shouldn't be counted as a reason to conclude it wasn't as it was prior to the weather change.<n>6. Therefore, the correct answer is E: barometric pressure. As it says, barometric pressure is decreased by human activity, whether it's a weather modification activity, a plane flying by, driving a car down a paved street, etc; it doesn't have to be rain clouds or bad weather in general. <n>Answer: E: barometric pressure <n><n>### Instructions:Answer the question by choosing the word/phrase that best completes the sentence.  <n>Input: When the person arrives at the gate, what action will he

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5.

This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

Choices:  A: open letter B: thank god C: say goodbye D: bless you E: listen to radio<n><n>### Response:		A is not the correct answer. Open letters are written documents sent to a recipient, but "finished a conversation" implies spoken communication. For the same reason, B is not the correct answer as people do not say "thank god" after having a conversation to close it.<n><n>### C is the correct answer. Saying "goodbye" to a person after a conversation is a common phrase that many people would recognize. It doesn't indicate the closing of a written communication, so it will not be confused with "open letter".

Choices: A: in winter B: in the summer C: with the flip of a switch D: with the flip to another switch E: with the flip or change <n>Rationales:<n>1. "the flip of a switch," "the flip to another switch," and "with the flip or change" are incorrect because they are not ways your house could cool.<n>2. "With the flip of a Switch" and "with the flop of a switch" make mention of a particular switch located somewhere and how that switch has the ability to cool your house. It doesn't answer the question.<n>3. "with the flip to another" is irrelevant because it uses a different switch to cool your home rather than the one in the question. It does not say where this switch is located. It makes no mention of it being in the house at all.<n>4. The question asks which of these does your home take the longest time to cooled.<n>5. The answer to that would be "the flip of the switch" as it's the fastest way to cool down your home. Switching on a fan, for example would require you to walk to another part of the house and flip the switch. <n>6. So, with the flip of the switch is the answer. <n><n>Input: Why is it better to get rid of bad eggs than to just throw away the bad eggs? Choices: A.

E:  to move the basketball from one hand to the next.<n><n>### Response  :<n>In basketball, a player is dribbling when they are holding the ball and moving the ball back and forth between their own hands. This means that option A is incorrect because it is not what a player does when dribbling. <n>    <n>Option B might be correct because it is possible for the player to dribble the ball in order to get better control of it or in order to avoid losing possession of it. But it's not the only reason players dribble; the others are probably

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

Choices:  A: water fountain B: military base C: apartment D: fire house E: bus stop<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>This question involves the task of determining what people would be doing near a specific road, and what type of location could be that. In this question, we are interested in where we could find a line of several people that is adjacent to a road. There is some uncertainty in the type of object we are searching for. It could be a physical fence or physical barrier with people beside it, or it could be a mental barrier formed by people standing around in close proximity to each other. <n><n>As well, while the word "line" can mean a specific row of people standing beside each other, it can also connote physical lines like a road. This question is vague enough that it could refer to several different situations where several people would be standing near a road. We first must consider the context of this question and the situation in which we are searching. We may be looking at a crowd of people who are waiting in line at a food stand on a road that people frequently drive (and walk) on. Alternatively, we may be looking at a group of people standing beside a wall at a concert.<n><n>We consider each choice for possibilities that would fit with the question.<n><n>If we were to answer C: apartment, then this would be incorrect because the question specifically mentions wanting a location that is adjacent to a specific road. This location could only be a building or apartment that is directly beside or facing a street, but not something that is on the other side of the street or a building across the street. So, from our list of four options we can eliminate A: water fountains, C: apartment, and D: fire house. <n><n>However, if this is an example of a group of people who are standing on a mental line waiting to get something, then all these options would be appropriate. For example, if the question was asking where people would be standing on a train station, they could be standing on the edge of the tracks in a row. This question is vague, so it could be about lines of people waiting for transport like a bus or a train.<n><n>### Rationales<n><n>This question is vague and ambiguous, and it is therefore difficult to determine which choices are correct or not. We cannot assume that any of the choices would be appropriate at the moment that we are asked the question. We could only determine whether one of these choices would be more appropriate than the others.<n><n>We choose C: apartment

So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Why would someone confess to committing murder? Choices:  A: guilty conscience B: fear C: go free D: problems E: find god<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is C: FEAR.<n><n>### Input - Explanation:<n>This question is asking for a reason someone might confess to committing a murder. The only real way to determine the answer to this question is by using deductive reasoning. <n><n>### Demostration:<n>Let's assume I am at a police interview, and someone has accused me of murder (A). I am innocent so it would be illogical to confess this crime as no one is going to convince me with a guilty conscience (B). I then think of myself going free as a consequence of this (C). This is not likely because if I commit murder I should be sent to prison (D). The only logical answer is this, I will confess due to fear of going to prison (E). <n><n>### Input-Analysis: <n>This question is asking you to choose the reason someone might confess from a list of options.<n><n>### Method: <n>The best way to approach this problem is by using rational guessing, or eliminating the choices that are incorrect according to what is given.<n><n>### Answer: C: FEAR<n><n>### Input and Demostration: <n>**Input:** The person has confessed to murder.<n><n>In order to arrive at the correct answer I start with the following premises<n><n>* The person confessed to the crime.<n>* They are innocent.<n>* If they confessed it should be because they fear going to prison.<n><n>I then conclude that the only way this conclusion is possible in relation to the problem is if the person who committed the crime confessed it out of fear of going to prison.<n>We also know that if the person confesses to murder it means that there is evidence that points to them committing the murder, but at this point it does not mean that they did. This means that in order for the statement to be true they must confess.<n><n>We can conclude that the only way to get to this answer is if the person is innocent and to confess means that they fear going to prison as a result. So the best answer is C: Fear.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Therefore the only answer that fits this logic is option C, FEAR<n>

Choices: A: It's 100 dollars. B: It's a hundred.  C: It's a dime. D: It's $100. E: It's a fifty.<n>Rationales:1. The question asks how someone might say the sentence "I've got a phone and a video game.” The response should be how a person might express "I've got...".<n>2. There are various ways one might say the sentence but it is a single expression so the unit of measure must be the same as the unit of measurement used in the sentence itself. <n>3. A: the sentence is missing a "0" so this doesn't correctly express "I got a phone," let alone "I got a phone AND a game."<n>4. B: "It's 10 bucks" doesn't convey the same meaning. It's not used the same way.<n>5. C: "It's ten cents" also incorrectly expresses "I got a phone."<n>6.

What hidden force can be activated in my existence? Maybe new freedom? I do not know exactly what happens but when I forgive others they feel better and I feel better. When I release a lot of negativity, new feelings may enter my life. However, I feel that I need to have another choice for freedom, maybe a better heart or good karma.<n><n>  2.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What should you do if your pens aren't work?

Demonstration: You should use either a B or D.<n><n>I know this for sure because my pens are not working.<n><n>2. Response D does not follow the rules of the instruction.<n><n>D: take notes does  not complete the instruction.<n><n>3. Response A is not a proper response for an English student. It also does not follow the rules for the task.<n><n> 4. A:  ink in is not a way that "one should do" when there are missing ink.<n><n> 5. Response C: ink cartridge also does not follow the instructions.<n><n> 6. I think E: scribble would be the best (if not the only) choice here because the instructions tell you what to "do" (do not say what "you should do"). It's also an option that doesn't violate any grammar rules.<n><n>7. I know E: scribble is the correct answer because the instructions say "what SHOULD you do?" (note the capital "S" in the word "should" here). That means it's a required action here.<n><n>Answer: D: take notes<n>

Choices:  A: make noise B: have tea C: make time D: make payments E: take time<n><n>### Response:		It depends on the kind of bank you're looking at. Big banks have become more aggressive in recent years and are now offering "bigger" services, but at the cost of putting customers first. The average person should be looking for what's better for your banking needs, not what's better for the bank's bottom line.<n>### Rationale:A bank is a place where you can keep your money for safekeeping and deposit. You might also make payments or withdrawals at a bank. Banks may be private or public. A public bank can be as small <n>as just one employee—you—and just as large as the most impressive multi-billion-dollar corporate bank. Banks can also be "private." A private bank is a building that is set aside for people to do their banking business. Private banks don't <n>do much banking work. They might have one or two tellers at the time when you're at the counter, but they're usually pretty busy and keep you waiting. In a private bank, tellers give out bank checks, which you can then cash anywhere else. In most <n>private banks, the teller is paid a salary or <n>commission by the bank and is therefore expected to make deposits and withdrawals as quickly as possible so that it doesn't cost more than it's worth to do things like cash checks or do other services. Private banks are usually run by <n>a board of directors. <n><n>### Input<n><n>A. Find the odd one out. The questions are: B. You don't notice because the dog C. You don't care D. You won't want to. Rationale: A. When I say the dog, I don't mean the dog. I just mean that there's a dog in my home. So, the dog would be odd because it's not what you'd normally expect in a house. B. The word "car" is used more often than any other word in these questions, but "car" is not an item. We would use the word "car" in a sentence where it refers to a vehicle, like "Why is the car a car when I'm buying it?" But in this case, <n>"car" actually means something else. So, "Find the odd one out" indicates

This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3.

Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

Choices:  A: pretty flowers. B: hen house C: natural habitat D: storybook E: dense forest<n><n>### Response:		<n>The fox walked from a human, city, to a wildlife, forest, location. In the city, the fox experienced an artificial environment for its living. In the wild, the fox would experience a natural habitat for its living. A fox lives in a forest and its habitat should be considered. Its habitat provides everything that it requires for its survival including the proper atmosphere, sunshine, water, food, plants, living space and shelter.<n><n>Another assumption can be made. The reason for fox migrating to the forest may be that the fox is tired of artificial environment. <n>There must be something more beautiful in the forest the fox has noticed. The fox might be looking for a pretty flower.<n><n>Finding shelter in the forest might help the fox survive. Finding shelter in the forest may be another reason.

Choices:  A: backyard B: restaurant C: crockpot D: neighbor's house E: barbeque<n><n>### Response:		If you slowly cook something using a grill, it would be called barbecue cooking.  Barbeque and barbecue are both common spellings for barbecue as described by [Chambers](https://www.chambers-dictonary.com/english/-b-1/barbecue) as "a barbecue." Barbecue is defined as "a meal cooked on a barbecue grill." This is not applicable to the instruction because the context is "slowly cooking," so the definition of barbecue needs to be restricted to barbecue grills. According to [Chambers](http://www.chambs.co.nz/def2500/def-5792.html), grill, grilling, and griller all imply "to cook food, typically meat, on a grill/grilling surface." While [Cambridge University Press](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/grill) states that grill "a long, metal surface for cooking meat over fire or under a hot electric light," I think we can assume that if someone is using a grill to cook something slowly, they are using a grill as defined by Chambers. Finally, according to [Cambridge University](https://dictionary.reference.com/help/common/dictionary/dictionary.help/topic/grilling) a slow barbecue (also grilling) is a cooking technique that "involves using indirect heat and long exposure to high temperature, usually for smoky flavor." This is the most appropriate definition of the word "slowly" in the instruction. <n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What is a great place to lay in the sun? Choices:  A: in the basement B: west C: solar system D: beach E: beans<n><n>### Response:		1. This question asks for the right place to lay in the son. There are three main types of sun, therefore the logical answer is C: solar system.<n>This choice is validated as correct by the rationale that the solar system is composed of eight planets including the Sun, and they each have their own surface area.<n>Therefore you could simply lay outside anywhere on one of the planets and receive the perfect amount of sunlight.<n><n>### InputWhat should you do if you're out fishing and you don't catch anything? Choices:  a: fish b: catch a c: catch a d: catch more fish e: throw a hook<n><n>### Response<n>- As the question is asking for an action when you don't catch any fish, the answer is a: fish.<n>It is the only choice where you don't do anything with the fish you have. All other answers involve getting rid of fish you catch.<n><n>### Difference<n>  * C: catch a is wrong, as it tells me what to do with the fish you catch, not what to do when you have nothing.<n>  * d: catch more fish is wrong, because that is not what the question is asking for.<n>  * e: throw a hook is wrong, because you throw a hook anyway whether or not you catch a fish!<n><n>### Input<n>What happens when you go into shock? Choices: 1. A: you lose all of your energy 2. B: you go into a state of unconsciousness 3. C: your blood pressure lowers drastically 4. D: you go into a dream state 5. E: you feel dizzy<n><n>### Response 1. I assume this question is talking about total body shock from any number of sources.<n><n>### Reason1. C: your blood pressure drops drastically is incorrect as it is the symptom of shock rather than the cause.<n><n>### Rationale 2. A: You lose all of you energy is incorrect because you just don't lose all your energy when you go into shock.<n><n>### Response2. 1: A: you lose all your energy can't be right because the only way you can lose all of your energy would be to die!<n><n>### Rational 3.B: you go into a drun

We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6.

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:She needs to visit a bookshop after buying the latest fashion, where should she look?

The question asked where you can store meat for a long time, and if you store it in the freezer you are already storing it a long time, in perpetuity.<n>You could not really have chosen better than a butcher shop for that exact reason, though - the meat would not last a long time in the butcher shop in the sense of "will it still be there later in time," but in the sense of "could the meat go bad" and you are already excluding the chance of the meat going bad.<n><n>So, if you store the meat in the fridge, it will last a long time as long as you keep your fridge open. If you store it in the cold, it will last longer in the cold.<n><n>If we're going to talk about it as long as the frige is open, then it's going to have to be the frige because of the butcher shop, unless the question is "where can you store meat to last indefinite time" and in that case the butcher shop could be the answer.<n>If you store meat in a freezer for an indefinite amount of

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:It was a great rest, she had never felt this much what in the morning?

If a person is murdered then they are dead, but if a person is very depressed and if they died or not, the question asked about what would result in death.  <n>## Validity:<n>This response is Invalid.<n>Option D: murder is not applicable, because according to the logical reasoning of the question, this is a response would be given if the person were not very depressed. So, if a person is very  depressed they can't be murdered.<n><n>## Option E:  cyanide<n><n>This is not an option which is correct according to the language of the question.

Choices:  A: mail box B: suitcase C: front door D: bowl E: post office<n><n>### Response:		The question asks about a person delivering a letter directly to someone's hand in response to a request. Although option A: mail box does seem reasonable because letters are delivered through mailboxes, the question explicitly says a person delivers letters. A mailbox does not necessarily denote a human is handing someone a letter, and sometimes it is automated. As such, option A is incorrect.  Option B: suitcase may seem like the right answer because it can hold a letter, but again we cannot say definitively that a person is carrying the letter, just in case it is an automated delivery or not. This leaves us with three viable solutions. In option D: bowl, a person is definitely serving a letter to someone by handing it directly to them. Option E: post office does not necessarily mean a person delivers a letter to someone's hand, but it does show the person is serving the letter.  Option C: front door is most likely incorrect because we can't be sure it involves human interaction. So, option D: bowl and E: post office are both correct. <n><n>### Input : If someone is doing this, they are doing it in a way that will not be useful. Choices: 	A: making a mistake B: forgetting something C: cheating D: eating E: failing<n>Rationales: Option A: making a mistake 1. All five options have different meanings that indicate a way people are doing things. 2. So, it is confusing as the options are contradictory, as the question implies that if someone is doing something, they should do it successfully i.e. not make a mistake. So, we should not do A: making a mistake. 3. Option B: forgetting something isn't useful because by definition it means the person has forgotten something. 4. The next option D: eating doesn't quite make sense because eating sounds like something a person would actively be doing to achieve a goal. 5. Option E: failing isn't useful because that's an outcome of a behavior, not the behavior itself. 6. Therefore, it is clear that option C: cheating is the only viable option in this case. The question asks about doing something, but cheating is something being done, instead of simply being a method of executing something.<n><n>### Input - What is the opposite of something that moves forward

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:The president had to make a decision regarding the hate attack on his country, what did he do?

Choices:  A: music room B: music store C: music class D: medium E: house<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. If we are looking for a place to learn some music, the music room (A) is an easy assumption, and could be the case for some music. <n>2. A music store (B) may have music teachers, or could provide equipment for rent, which wouldn't really help us if we're looking to learn music. <n>3. The music class (D) could be a valid answer, unless it's referring to an "upright piano" class that would help with actually playing the instrument. <n>4. The medium (E) is a strange answer to get here, so we're left with two remaining answers, and A being the first choice, we're left with C: music class. Since we asked, "Where would someone learn to..." and the answer is referring to "learning to play an uprights piano," we know it has to be a person teaching another person to play the upright piano.<n><n>### Sample Instruction:<n>You've been given some new, blank sheets of paper.

It isn't necessary to buy blank paper in order to put ink on paper, so B: library would not have ink available to you. <n>2. The office supply store (D) may have ink pens or other ink-related items like markers, but the correct answer would still be "home" because we assumed we would be provided with the ink in order to "start writing." <n>3. Similarly, it's likely you do not have a pencil sharpener (E) in your home, and your home (A) wouldn't naturally have pencil sharpeners. <n>4. Therefore, the correct answer would be C: office supplies store.<n><n>### Required Task:<n><n>You've given a set of paper and a pencil.

Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

Choices:  A: shake hands B: control events C: talk to each other D: think creatively E: dress themselves<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: Shake hands<n><n>### Justify:<n>The people in class were most likely instructed to brainstrom ideas since this is a group activity and the only appropriate response is for them to work together. Brainstorming requires the people in class to use their minds, so it makes sense for this to be their most important activity. We know this because the people in class need to use their minds to brainstorm together and work as a class team to arrive at new ideas. This makes the most sense because the people in class can't control events or think creatively, but instead can use their minds to think critically and contribute to the brainstorming session.<n><n>### Input"While reading, what is the sound of ink making its way from a quill to a parchment?"

This would most likely be a sensation experienced while reading. It could also be experienced while working with papers or books, such as when flipping through the pages or tearing them apart. <n><n>### The sound of ink making it's way from a quill and parchment is defined as:<n><n>- The quill is a feathered pen, used for writing before metal nibs became available. The quill is sharpened to a point at the tip and then covered with ink and dipped into a container. <n>- Parchment is a type of paper with a smooth, even surface made from animal skin coated with animal guts and lime. <n><n>A sensation experienced while inking a parchment with a quill would be described as a "swoshing" sound, because the ink is being pushed out of the container by the quill, spreading the ink across the surface of the parchment. This would be contrasted to a "scratching" sound, which is not applicable as it would describe the quill making contact with the surface, rather than the ink moving through it. <n><n>##

Choices:  A: communicating with others B: hurt feelings C: dry mouth D: intimacy E: changing behavior<n><n>### Response:		When talking to someone, you would be hoping to achieve communication with others. You may hope to achieve other things, but communication between two people is the main hope you'd have for talking, since it refers to talking with others. You may, for example, think you hope to change someone's behavior, but in reality you'd want to communicate with them. This is because you'd be doing or saying things to have an influence on them (change their behavior), and if that works out then you'd consider that to have gone well in communication with others. You can't be hoping to achieve hurt feelings or dry mouth, because those are not things that are inherent in conversation.<n><n>### Input:"If you've never made a mistake, you've never made anything."

The questions asks “If your watching television and do nothing, what have you had?”. We know from the questions that our tv is not on, it is not being used and our sitting on the sofa, doing nothing. A) Getting Fat - Is not something we do whilst watching television, we are just sitting. <n>2. If we type words the screen on our TV then the television is not ‘doing something’ or accomplishing something.<n>3. Falling asleep is an action that can take whilst watching television, its not what you 'get' done while you are watching television.

An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where can peanut butter be stored?

Glass containers like this come in all kinds of sizes and are easy to clean and sanitize.<n>> ## Solutions<n>> #### 1. What you can get from the instruction? What is the key?<n>> - Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question<n>> - Demonstration: Input: <n>> Input: Where could you find an ice shelf? Choices: A: ocean B: mountain C: island D: glacier E: lake<n>> Rationales: 1 - A is ocean because ice shelves are found on ice and we are saying that the choice is on land (mountains and islands are on land). Because it's on land, then B (mountains) and C (islands) cannot be correct answers<n>> 2 - D is glacier because it has to be on land so that it can be found "on an ice shelf"<n>> 3 - E is lake because ocean (A) and glacier (D) have water, and because of this fact and if we consider B (mountains) or C (islands) as land-only, lake would be the only option<n>> Input: Which of these is an item you put in the refrigerator? Choices: A. pot B. pan C. box D. can E. bag<n>> Rationales - 1 - Pot is not an item placed in a cold storage so A (pot) is not the correct option<n>> 2 - You only need to get one item out of your freezer, box does not sound like it could be an item, so - D (can) and E (bag) cannot be correct options either<n>> 3 - We do not get cans out of the fridge because the cans are kept in the freezer. So, D (can) does not need to be an option (and neither does E (bag))<n>> 4 - We place pots & pans on our stove and we do not keep them inside of our fridge. That is why A is incorrect<n>> 5 - Putting the pot in the fridge would be the same as putting the box in the fridge, which is why we know D (pan) and E (bag

This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Two friends wanted to spend a quiet evening together, what did they go see? Choices:  A: wedding B: friend's house C: internet cafe D: movie E: restaurant<n><n>### Response:		The answer is A: wedding. The friends can't see a wedding because they are two people. They can't see a movie because they are not watching the movie themselves; they are watching each other. They can't "go" to a movie unless they are leaving one.<n><n>### Input<n><n>It is quite common, however, to find out that a friend is in the middle of something really wonderful that you could join and enjoy.<n>Choices:  A: work B: a great new job C: a party D: the beach E: an exercise<n>Rationales:<n>1. An exercise is not a thing or event because it is an action (in this case, a workout).<n>2. An exercise is not at a single location. If a friend says an exercise to join, they mean that you go see someone exercising. If you do not know where anyone is exercising, they could not invite you to join them.<n>3. A party is neither an event nor a thing. They have the potential to be either, but either can happen only occasionally.<n>4. The beach is neither an event nor an object because (like an exercise) it can also often be the place where one event occurs (like a picnic). If one is invited to the beach and does not know where anyone or anything is, they could not join the beach.<n>5. A new job is not a thing, either. <n>6. An event is not the middle of a great new job, it is an activity that happens as a part of the job. <n>7. All the other options are activities or events that the friend might do or be doing. <n><n>### Instructions<n><n>The first step is to create a list of as many verbs as you know in the active voice.<n>You cannot use any objects which have been declared in one of the two previous steps.  <n>The second step is to create a complete sentence using the first 2/3 of one of your sentences from the previous step and the last verb in the previous step.  <n>The last step is to identify which of the four categories the verb in the completed sentence most closely corresponds.

Choices:  A: desk drawer B: cup C: pencil case D: shelf E: office depot<n><n>### Response:		<n>B.<n>### Demonstration explanation:<n>This question is asking specifically about where John got the pencils to replace those he had run out of. The wording gives the reader a lot of leeway in terms of where he might be getting them, and provides a lot of ambiguity. A reader could understand this question as anything from getting more pencils to get new pencils to get more pencils and replace the ones he lost. "Desk drawer" is correct because it suggests getting more pencils directly from his desk or home supplies. "Office Depot" would not be an appropriate answer since the question is about a specific supply of pencils. "Cup" is incorrect because it's not specified that John would use the pencils out of the cup, and "pencil case" is incorrect because the case itself can only hold a few pencils at most, so the only way to get the right number of pencils is by getting more.<n><n>### Input.

Choices:  A: training B: satisfaction C: injury D: beauty E: late<n><n>### Response:		<n>I had a dog when I was growing up, and I often had trouble grooming her nails properly. There would be times when I’d try to trim them and end up accidentally snapping one off. That happened a few times and they never ended well. If doing that correctly doesn’t cause injury to the pet, I’d say it is likely to happen when done incorrectly.<n><n>### Input- Response:<n>I have owned pets, but I always had my friends and family provide grooming for my pets. That said, I don’t know what the correct answer is. Given that grooming is done to be aesthetically pleasing, I believe that the correct answer should be B: satisfaction. I could be wrong though.<n><n>### Response- Input:<n>I often get my pets out for walks, and they also like to play outside with friends. This results in their nails getting pretty dirty. I’ve heard that cutting them regularly can relieve discomfort, so I think that it’s important that their nails are trimmed. I guess that makes the choice C: injury, because they might cut their own claws if they’re untrimmed.<n>

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Eating breakfast in bed can make you feel what, assuming that you don't spill anything? Choices:  A: vomiting B: pleasure C: happiness D: contentment E: mess<n><n>### Response:		 B: pleasure<n><n>Rationales: Pleasure in this sense is simply not getting something undesired. In this situation, having breakfast in bed is desirable, and thus getting it is desired.<n><n>### Difficulty: Moderate<n>

Choices:  A: go to jail B: incarceration C: intercourse D: death E: judgement<n><n>### Response:		<n>Explanation: The judge did not take this particular responsibility lightly; for he was considering a "guilty" decision for the man being punished. But it was his passing sentence to "judgement," rather than to death, that condemned the man in question.<n><n>Explanation: I chose death as my first answer, but obviously this is not the correct answer. If you take the question as literally as they ask, you will notice that this question is not specific to a crime. A more literal answer might be the crime of murder, but this does seem to narrow it down into a specific crime. I've seen both "going to jail and" "being punished." Although these are accurate descriptions of such events, they're not really the core meaning of a sentence. This is why the most accurate response is "judgement," as it involves the decision of whether or not a judgement for a crime is valid, and then actually sending that judgement down after a process that has been followed through.<n><n>Rationales:<n><n>### Input/Output<n>```<n>Enter A,B,C,D as 1,2,3,4<n>Enter A,B as 1,2<n>Enter B as 2<n>Input<n>1000<n><n>Your output should be as follows<n><n>50<n>15<n>5<n>Output<n><n>1000 + 50 + 15 + 5<n><n>Input<n>10 - 15 * 100: +2 + 3 - (6 * 2)<n><n>Output<n><n>114<n><n>```<n><n>### Input<n><n>> What is the missing part of the following figure?

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:After eating a dinner of uncooked chicken, what was felt by the poor man?

Subtract the number of voweli from the total number of letters in the word.<n>3.  Add one to the remainder obtained and multiply by 2.<n>4.

The dog was tied. 8. You'd see anything go by.<n>Rationales:<n>1. The first sentence begins with the word "that's", uses an adverb ("what" can be an adverb) in the middle, and ends in a question ("got"? is a question). Therefore, this sentence is technically incomplete. The sentence is still grammatically correct, and the missing word or words do not disrupt the flow or meaning of the sentence, but this sentence is incomplete because it lacks a word.<n>2. This sentence uses an active verb ("was"), which means that it is grammatically correct but not a full sentence by our measure of "contains a subject and predicate" as it lacks an object that could be considered part of the predicate. Again, the sentence remains complete, grammatically correct, and has full meaning, but it lacks one (or more) piece of information - namely, the object of the verb.<n>3. In this example sentence, "was it" is an auxiliary, but it's not the main part of the sentence. Furthermore, it only has one purpose when used in a question as it is not the subject and not the predicate. This sentence is, therefore, grammatically complete and grammatically full<n>4.The sentence starts and

Choices A: botanic garden, B: flower garden, C: backyard, D: supermarket, E: outdoors.<n><n>Rationales:<n>1. The question is a statement, and is asking what unusual varieties of ros are located where.<n>2. Backyard (C) does not sell roses.<n>3.

The botanic garden (A) sells a wide range of unusual varieties of rose that are native to different climates.<n>6. Roses from the botanic garden are unique in that they are often grown and nurtured in a specific, controlled and cared for environment. Their unique growth and environment help them to flourish in a way that roses from other places commonly cannot.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What will you need to do to decide whether to be seeing artifacts? Choices:  A: learning B: painful memories C: thinking D: awe inspiring E: pleasure<n><n>### Response:		If you are determining whether you would be seeing artifacts based on a specific criterion, such as learning or thinking, then B: painful memorie or D: awe inspriring would be better answers.<n><n>If you are determined by other factors such as pleasure, then A: learning or C: thinking would be better.<n><n>### Input for task 10:<n>In this task, you will read a situation and think of how the person or people in the situation are feeling.

What percent of repetitions does the average person perform?<n>Rationales:<n>1. People do not perform one thing 150 times a day, which is why an average is not a logical calculation. <n>2. People do not repeat actions 150 times in a day. <n>3. The number 150 is not the minimum or maximum amount of things that a person can do in a day.<n>4. People do not do 80 things that are repetitions.<n>5. All of the things done by people cannot be categorized as repetitions.<n><n>### Task 12:<n>Write a response that applies the mathematical technique specified by the task prompt. In this task, it will be necessary to make inferences. These inferences could potentially be based upon the author's statements and/or the data presented in the scenario.<n>Example: Choice 5 (e) is for Inferences.

This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:A lonely man committed suicide, why would he do that? Choices:  A: suffering B: he was happy C: avoid problems D: unhappy E: end pain<n><n>### Response:		Suicide is the action of killing yourself deliberately. So, to answer the question, we need to understand why someone would kill him or herself deliberately. <n>### Choices:  A) suffering - could be a possible answer, but can be argued as suicide is more an emotional act than a physical one <n>### B) he was happy - doesn't support the hypothesis of the question.  It can be argued suicide has very little to do with the emotional state of a person. <n>### C) avoid problems - can be a valid reason, but it doesn't seem like it would prompt a deliberate suicide<n>### D) unhappy - is an inaccurate explanation of why someone would kill themself deliberately, however suicide could be a way of seeking relief from unhappiness. <n>### E) end pain - this option seems to fit, so we can choose that one.<n><n>Answer: E: end pain<n>

In this case, the students are studying together ("asking questions") which is not their primary goal. The student's primary goal is something they are hoping to "further".

Choices:  a) talking by phone b) talking in private c) talking around others d) none of these e) only public places<n><n>### Response<n><n>1. With the question like this an important thing to remember is that the choice that best fits is the one that applies to the most situations. If I only have one person to speak to at a funeral, I might be speaking to them one on one and I would not be talking to two people, so this is a choice that doesn't quite fit and should not be chosen.<n>2.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:The garage had light sensors and automatic doors, what kind of house was it? Choices:  A: modern house B: building C: townhouse D: neighbor's house E: downtown<n><n>### Response:		Answers: 1. A: modern house 2. B: building 3. C: townhouse 4. D: neighbor's and downtown house<n><n>### Response Reasoning: 1. Light sensors and automatic doors are features often seen in modern housing, so a modern house is likely in the mix of the possible houses.<n><n>2. While "building" can mean different things depending on the sentence in which it is used, it tends to refer to anything large or commercial. Since this house is more of a residence, "building" is more likely referring to something similar to a house.<n>3. "Townhouse" is not the answer, even if in the literal sense, because a townhouse, by definition, is not detached from a structure. In this case, the house could be detached, in which case it may or may not be a townhouse.<n>4. A neighbor's house is not the answer as neighbors can live in any house. And while "downtown" can refer to a particular part of a city, it is not referring to a specific building, but rather a group of businesses and residences. So, none of the remaining options are specific enough for us to know which one the garage was referring to.<n><n>Answer: 1. A. Modern House 2. B. Building 3. C. Townhouse 4. D.

A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:The gambler had been winning a lot, he wisely decided to what? Choices:  A: matchwinning B: cash in C: compete D: return E: celebrate<n><n>### Response:		<n>1) D: return<n>2) A: matchwinning<n><n>### Demotion:<n>Rationales:<n>1.  The gambler won a lot, so he wisely decided to match their winnings.<n>2. This means that he would match his winnings by betting the original amount of money won. This is more appropriate than D: returning (although this may be an equally acceptable option), as matching implies exchanging identical amounts. <n>3. The gambler would not want to celebrate their winnings as this may indicate an increase in betting. This is an undesirable outcome when wanting to limit their risk by matchwinning. This is an undue waste of time, as the gambler should be concentrating on the next set of bets. Finally, the gambler shouldn't return (E) because this does not directly relate to the situation.<n>4. These rationales combined eliminate all options except for D: matchwinning, as the rationale for B: cash in is too vague and the rationale for E: celebrate isn't relevant.<n>5.<n>Answer: D matchwinning<n><n>Input: The teacher said she had never had what so she can't do it. Choices:  A. homework B. sleeping C. a baby D. more classes E. a pet<n><n>### Demonic:<n>Rationales to choose C: a baby is the answer:<n>1. No teacher can have a baby. <n>2. So, when the teacher has never had a baby, she can't say she might give one. <n>3. Thus, "can't do it" in the question means can't say she could do it. <n>4. Therefore, C a baby is the answer.<n>    <n>### Input: Your son wants to know what his mother does at night. What does he ask her?<n>    <n>### Demon:<n>Rationales :<n>1. Since the son wants to know what mother does at night, he asks her: What does she do at night? <n>2. The sentence is not the opposite like the given choice. <n>3.<n>**Answer:** C: What does she do in the evening?<n><n>Input: In some instances it is the duty of someone to tell them what they don't know.

The question is about a person who lives in the top of a tower and can see clouds. There have been many books throughout history, for example 1001 Arabian Nights, in which an unidentified main character lives in the top of an impressive structure, such as a tower, and is able to see clouds while looking out of a window.<n>2. However, there is no book in which a person living near a tower could live in radio station or city.<n>3.

In terms of meals made, in which position would the computer programmer stand on average?  Choices:  A:(1st) B:(2nd) C:(3rd) D: (4th)<n><n>### Rationales:<n>The computer programmer is most likely to be responsible for making a meal for each person in the household, because this is the most specialized role that each person takes. <n>The accountant provides an important service by managing the household budget.  However this doesn't necessarily provide the household with a meal.  The baker prepares some of the specialized meals in the household, so their contribution is not as important as the programmer's.  Additionally the baker receives most or only some of the meals they made, which may make it difficult to measure how many meals they really provided.  Finally the computer programmer has a higher skill level than the average member of their profession, and would therefore need to make fewer meals than a computer programmer of average ability. <n>Therefore the correct answer is B:(3rd); the programmer contributes meals at their specialist skill level, provides value for their contribution, and then receives some other meals in return.<n><n>### Answer:B:(3rd)<n><n>### The correct answers are:<n>1. oil refineries<n>2. in books<n>3.

Choices:  A: music store B: orchestra C: jazz band D: rock band E: music studio<n><n>### Response:		<n>Band, orchestra, jazz band, rock band are all musical groups that perform music together, and so it is most likely that a musician would perform a concerto (a full-length solo concert) most likely with one of these groups. On the other hand, a music store would not be likely a place where a concerto is performed, because they are mostly for selling instruments and music, and not primarily a place for performances.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. A musician is most likely perform a concerto with an orchestra or band. A music store would not be an appropriate place as they typically sell instruments and music, and have performances from solo artists. A clarinet concerto is a full- length solo concert so orchestra would be the preferred choice.

Therefore, we can eliminate options A and C because these options don't match the prompt.<n>3. Option E is incorrect because reproducing asexually is a sexual activity.<n>4. Therefore, it must be one of the remaining options: D or E. <n>5. Option D is incorrect because no animal is able to listen to each other. <n>6. Option E is not a scientific theory (although it could be one of many hypotheses)<n>7. Therefore, it must either be one of the remaining 2 options, D: feel pleasure, or E: reproduce asexully<n>8. So, we can conclude that it is answer E: animals weren't able do pleasure, but reproduce asexually which is the opposite of pleasure.<n><n>### Input : Some species of birds migrate. The animals that are best known for doing this are <n>A: snakes B: bats C: shrimp D: dogs E: bees<n><n>### Response :<n><n>If you were not able to answer the second or third question, you may need some background reading on biological evolution<n>1. Options A, B, and D are all incorrect because they are all nouns.<n>2. Option C, shrimp, which is a noun, would be more suitable as the answer to a question involving species rather than animals, so option B: bird is more correct.<n>3. Option A: snakes are known to migrate.<n>4. Option B: bats<n>5. Some people argue that bats are a flightless mammal, but they are still not technically birds, since the word "bird" also refers to those animals classified in the taxonomic order Aves.<n>6. Option E: bees<n>7. The most common assumption seems to favor option C: shrimp
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:The new kitten hadn't gotten used to what it was allowed to climb on in most rooms, so the owned kept the bedroom door what? Choices:  A: opened B: closed C: found at shower D: falling down E: locked<n><n>### Response:		<n>> _A: opened_<n><n>### Rationales: 1-2<n>1) The bedroom door is a specific example that has already been given in the sentence. This means it's an example of what the new kitten can't climb on, so by inference that would mean it can't climb anything else either which makes sense since it's a young kitten who should not really be climbing yet.<n>2) The sentence specifically states that the kitten hasn't gotten used yet, so it would be reasonable to surmise that this means there was a period of time where it was used to climbing in other rooms first and then was not allowed to climb in the bedroom.<n><n>### Answer: A: opened<n><n>### Instructions - Write a response that appropriatley completes the request. Write your answer in the text area and do not use a drop-down or similar.<n>### Input:<n>* What do you do in order to make other people feel bad for laughing at the silliness on television that the person is in charge of? Choices: <n>* A: Watch it without laughing B: Do not laugh out loud C: Mash your face D: Stare E: Laugh out loud and try to seem very embarassed for the actors or actresses that were laughing<n><n>### Rationale: 1-5<n>1. The question suggests that we're going to find options to make others feel bad, so it's most logical to consider ways to make others feel bad when laughing. <n>2. Option A: Watch it without Laughing - In order to make others feel bad for laughing out loud at something in a movie or television show, the best way I could think of was making them watch it without laughing out loud too. If I mash my face in embarrassment to try to look like I hate it, there's another person there watching it with me that is going to feel as silly as me laughing out loud to something inappropriate like a funny moment on TV or a joke when you weren't supposed to be laughing. <n>3. Option B: Do not laugh at all- This is really just an ineffective way to get those around you to feel bad, because if you can't watch it with a straight face then it

Choices:  A: cause spots on leaf B: healthy C: wellness D: ball stopped E: cure<n><n>### Response:		When researchers are studying the spread of a disease, they are interested in the cause of the disease. This would involve investigating what makes diseases spread. The word "fast" in the prompt suggests that researchers are trying to understand the cause in time, and this is why they are looking for what causes the disease to spread quickly. The word "spot" in the prompt is most likely referring to the initial symptoms of a disease, such as a small rash or spot on a leaf. The cause spots on leaf is the correct answer because it is related to the researchers' motivation for studying the disease and provides additional context on why they are looking for the cause.<n><n>### Input : Who's job might require them to give directions?

So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:The teams were evenly matched when competing against one another, what did spectators want to find out? Choices:  A: envy B: resentment C: winning or losing D: one winner E: two winners<n><n>### Response:		<n>If the teams were evenly matched, then there would be mutual suspense. <n><n>This is a great example of using deductive reasoning. The spectators want to find the outcome of the competition, which makes A and E inappropriate choices. When the teams are evenly matched, there can just be one winner, not two (D & E), and they won't be envious or resentful of the competition (B & C). Therefore, "spectators wanted to find out the outcome of the competition" was the most appropriate answer<n><n>### Input::In order for a person to win a lot of money in the lotto, they must buy many lottery tickets.<n><n>### Response<n>### Instruction Response:<n>### You might write:<n>Therefore, if someone buys many lottery tickets and still does not win, then they will lose their money.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>This example has two different answers and so they should each be written.<n><n>### **Answer A:** <n>Therefore, one person wins big and everyone else loses their money.<n><n>By combining the concepts, the outcome in the question and the conclusion show that there can be only one winner in a game like the lottery, which is why everyone else will lose their buck if they don't get lucky.<n><n>### Answer B:<n>Therefore, because many people lose their money each week playing lotto without winning big,<n>their losses aren't as big as those who do.<n><n>The opposite is true if they were to lose all the money they put into betting on lotto. Lotto plays are similar to a risk, so for each person, there will not be an equal outcome between all losers and all winners in a lotto game.<n><n>### Conclusion:<n>This is a good example of using inductive reasoning. The conclusion is correct, as it should be, but it could be confusing why other people have to lose their money for the winner to win. It may seem like they have to lose because they lose (A) but actually, they just lose because the other person won (B).<n><n>### Input :What does not an architect do?

Choices: A: children B: older persons C: animals D: criminals E: the unhealthy<n>> Response:E: the unhealth<n>> Rationales： 1. Where are those with strong bodies not likely to visit in a public park? 2. The question is asking where people with strong bodies might not be found. 3. This means we are not looking for people with weak bodies. 4. People with strong bodies are people who have a high level of physical fitness. 5. People who have strong bodies are typically not found in restrooms, as this is a place for people to go to as nature calls. 6. We know that older persons (B) may be found in parks, as they often enjoy the outdoors. Animals (C) may also be found, as they may live in or roam through parks. 7. Criminals (D) are unlikely to visit public parks in order to avoid detection, and unhealthy people are likely to visit parks for exercise purposes, so this removes the option E: the unheathy. 8.

The same reasoning would apply to other options. A shelf (E) could be an appropriate place to store books, but then it's not also where you typically store dishes. A living room (D) is a place to hang out, not necessarily somewhere you'd normally find dishes. Therefore, out of these options, a kitchen table (C) is the only choice where you would indeed have easy access to books and kitchen items. So, the answer would be C: table.<n><n>Answer:  The best choice in 1 is apartment - dishes in the fridge shelf or table are not places where you'd likely store books, but you could store books in the living room (D) or in the library (E) if you wanted to.<n>

Choices:  A: sailing vessel B: paddleboat C: ship D: motorboat E: tugboat<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: The helm is not something  you wear on your head,  rather  it moves the masts. <n>Choices:  A:  sailing vessel  B:  paddleboat  C:  ship  D:1 motorboat E:2 tugboat<n>The correct answer is C: ship. This is because the helm is something with which a ship moves its masts. A ship has masts, and therefore the helm would be used to move its masts. A paddleboat isn't a ship, so that's not correct. A sailing vessel could be used both for sailing and for not moving the masts, so that's incorrect. A motorboat has motors instead of masts, so it doesn't use the helm at all. Tugboats use a tug, not a helm, and so they're also wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is C: the ship.<n><n>### Detailed Response:<n>**Instruction:The helm is a nautical term for the ship's steering mechanism, and so it has to do with what the ship does. <n>**Demonstration:<n>The correct answer is the ship because the helm moves the masts on a ship. <n>A ship is defined as a large floating vessel that carries people or material. <n>Therefore, a ship has masts and uses the nautical term 'helm' to move these masts.**<n><n>An important part of communication is the use of nonverbal communication.

It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer.

C: traffic would be in a wide range of cities, because traffic is not specific to a particular density of city, so cities with a different population density won't be the root cause of traffic congestion. <n>6. Choice E: small cities is the correct answer, because as small cities would be less populated, there wouldn't be such a large number of people living in the same area for there to be much of a traffic problem, which is the root of congestion.  Therefore, the answer is E: small cities. <n><n>### Instructions:<n><n><n>Answer some questions to demonstrate that you can properly complete the provided tasks. <n>Your responses should be in the format of: <n>Input: [question text] - [choose one correct answer from 5 options]<n><n><n><n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:The people wanted to take the scenic route, they chose the highway that cut through the what?

Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:You are seeking to provide yourself what when you're applying for a job? Choices:  A: work B: employment C: income D: hope E: offer<n><n>### Response:		Demonstration: <n>1. The question is looking for what you are seeking when you are applying for a job. This suggests that we are trying to find an offer or salary in the job position.<n>2. However, neither choices A: work or B: employment are applicable. These are actions you will eventually take in a job you're applying for, but would not be available in a job you are currently applying to.<n>3. Therefore, answer D, Hope, is the correct answer. Even though it is not a verb, this is a reason why you would need to apply for a job and is fitting into the theme of the question, as hope is one of your reasons for applying for a job. <n>4. Choice E, Offer, is not the correct answer because an offer is not something you would seek during the job application.<n>5. Again, this also falls into what you are seeking during the application process, but isn't appropriate because it's not immediately available to the applicant.<n>6. Finally, choice C, Income, doesn't fit the correct logic because it's not possible to seek income when applying for a job.<n>Answer: D. Hope<n><n>### Input<n><n>Someone is looking for work on their own land. With regards to their plot of land, they wish it to be of good quality, clean, and in order. They won't be satisfied so far along if they aren't looking for something to put on the land. What are they looking for to place on their land? Choices: <n>A: soil B: seeds C: rocks D: plants E: crops <n><n>### Demostration: <n>1) The question is asking what the person needs to put on their land. They are looking for something.<n>2) Choices A: Soil and B: plants are both options to place on the land. <n>3) However, A: Soil refers to the ground itself, or the earth, on which plants will grow, but it also refers to the material that makes up the ground, like rock and clay.<n>4) This doesn't match the question, which is looking for anything you would put on the land, and which isn't exclusive to dirt or soil. <n>5) Option B, however, is correct. The person is seeking to acquire plants for their land.

Choices:  A: heartburn B: have fun C: enjoy D: gas E: food poisoning<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The question is what they are going to eat on the next ride and asks for a type of food. <n>2. We know by the answer choices that a hamburger is an option, so it would not likely produce food poisoning or heartburn. <n>3. Gas is possible, if they are going to a fast food place, but it’s less likely.<n>4. Since “gas” is the only non-food related answer choice, “gas” is the correct response. <n>

Choices: ☐ A: library ☐ B: house ☐ C: conference ☐ D: fast food restaurant ☐ E: paper<n><n>#### Rationales<n>1. The answer choices given to the prompt describe a physical place that one would eat meals and desserts, and where people may gather to socialize.<n>2. The answer choice “library” is incorrect since libraries are usually not places where food is typically consumed.<n>3. Fast food restaurants serve fast food like burgers, pizza, fries, tacos etc. But they do not typically have tables for people to eat in.<n>4. Conference centers and paperwork are also incorrect because there is no option to eat at tables in those places. <n>5. The answer B: “house” is the correct response as people typically have tables in their households. They can typically sit and eat at these tables which is impossible at fast food places and conference centers.<n><n>Answer: B: house<n><n>#### Demonstraion<n>Input: How does one use books and paper?

One cannot make multiple answers by putting books and paper in a drawer (D). Books and paper can only be put in the drawer if the drawer is small enough to fit a book and paper (like a wallet), and the other options do not correspond to the size of the drawer.<n>3.

A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.

This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Where would there be a connection to go to another place? Choices:  A: wires B: electrical circuit C: computer network D: wall E: freeway<n><n>### Response:		<n>> In my opinion, the question is asking where there would be a connection to go another place.<n>><n>> The answer could be "e" Freeway. It is the only one that uses the word "connect" in the same sentence like it is used in the question. The others are just saying what goes there such as "wires", or "electrical circuit".<n>><n>> The freeway is just a large road that many different types of vehicles travel. The vehicles travel up the freeway and "connect" with other places.<n><n>### Input:"What are some of the objects that will help you find your brother if he's lost?" Choices:  A" map B" watch C" compass D" mirror E" cell phone<n>Rationales:1. A "compass" is an object that helps you keep your bearings and sense of direction. You're just as likely to have a compass when your brother gets lost as you're not. <n>2. A "cell phone" is a technology that can help you contact others. Using a cell phone is the next logical step (that is, after you have located your brother). <n>3. A "mirror" is something you can use to see a "map". Thus, you must be able to locate the map first, you can't just use the mirror to locate yourself. <n>4. The "watch" is something that gives you the time of day. This is a secondary value to the "tardiness" or "eagerness" that your brother might encounter when he's lost. <n>5. Although a "map" is a great choice for this question, the only thing that a map can do to help your brother find his way is to show you where you are (not where he is). By this point you've already found him, he may use it to see the way to somewhere else, or he may leave it and not do anything with it. <n>6. The cell phone is the only object that allows you to speak to others in the same way it allows you to contact your brother via a cell phone.

Choices:  A: kitchen cupboard B: maryland C: chicken D: tuna E: pantry<n><n>### Response:		<n>In the answer choices kitchen cupboard, maryland, chicken, and pantry are all white meat-types. Tuna is not a white meat, rather a dark meat. <n><n>### Input :What is the opposite of right? Choices:  A : upside 180° B : left C : wrong 180° D : upside down E: opposite 180°<n><n>### Response : Upside (A) is the opposite of right (it would take you in the opposite direction of your current position). Left (B) isn't really opposed to rights, rather the opposite of left is right. It's not an opposite. Wrong (C) is not the opposite of right, correct (not right) is the opposite of wrong. As well as being an incorrect response, the opposite of a 180-degree move is not an 180-degrees (E). It would be a rotation of 180 degrees, not 180 degrees. <n><n>## Instructor's Solution<n><n>### Instructions:You're testing how well a group knows how to respond to a technical problem.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7.

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

Choices:  A: pharmacy B: person C: drugstore D: bedroom E: mcdonalds<n><n>### Response:		<n>D: bedroom<n><n>Rationales: The word `contraceptive` means that the person is looking for a type of condom which is bought for preventing pregnancy. Since the answer must be in a place where drugs are sold, one would need to go to a pharmacy in order to buy a contraceptive. Hence, the answer should be `A: pharmacy`, but it's not the correct answer.<n>

If people are looking at things that can move but are not, it would be from within it. However, they are not looking at them because they are moving, but they are looking at them because they can move and that is interesting."<n><n>### Output:<n><n><img src="img/output_response_2575992dc.png" height="300"/><n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>1. A football stadium is not the correct answer. People are standing inside a stadium to watch the game, so they couldn't be looking at things outside the stadium, which can move and aren't moving. <n>2. The surface of earth can be a place where people could be looking at things move around, but aren't. It could be an interesting topic for people to explore, as it's not possible for things to be in motion on earth and not moving at the same time. <n>3. A car show and an opera are possible options, as people attend car shows and operas to see things that move, and could be looking at them as part of an activity or to learn more about them. So, these options are the correct answers.<n><n>### <n><n>

Choices:  A: amusement park B: urban area C: airport D: shopping malls E: train station<n><n>### Response:		The appropriate answer choice (D) is: shopping malls. <n><n>### Rationales:The question is asking about what parking lot you would typically park in with shopping bags. It's safe to assume that you've probably parked in a shopping mall before with some items to buy and that you wouldn't want to get your shopping bags wet in the rain so you might bring an umbrella. <n>1. This means (D) the best answer choice is: shopping mall.<n> <n>### Input:When you find yourself in a large crowd and want to make a point in a public setting, what doesn't work at all? Choices:  C: shouting B: pointing A: talking E: text messaging<n><n>### Response<n>The best choice of answer (A): talking. <n><n>## Rationales:The best answer is talking (A), because this is by far the most common action taken in a large crowd. Pointing (B) requires you to direct attention to a specific person or object. Shouting (C) requires you to make your voice loud enough that it can be heard by all in your vicinity. Text messaging (E) does not require an audience, it could just be you. Talking (A) does. <n><n>## Input:Can you  run across the bridge if you are pushing a baby stroller? Choices:  B: yes C: no D: yes E: no F: yes<n>  <n>### Response<n>D: yes<n><n>## Rational:The question asked if there would be any difference in whether it's possible to cross a bridge on a stroller. What it does not ask is if the baby's weight exceeds the weight limit of the bridge (which makes a lot of sense in the given question, why would it matter?). So technically what is asked and what is stated in the answer is  different. Therefore the logical answer is D : yes. <n><n>## Instruction:The instructions state "you don't use a single item to help your friend with their toothache."

What did he shoot at? Choices:  A: body armor B: ungulate C: bomber D: kill people E: animal<n><n>### Response:		<n>It was overkill. What did he shoot at in pursuit of his lunch?<n><n><n>Rationales:<n>1. In the original question, there was mention of the "cannon" in the same sentence as the "kill people.", therefore the "cannon" the shoot at is most likely the "cannon" used to kill people and not the "cannon" that James used to shoot at lunch.<n>2. The answer is E: animal, because animals are the only thing that could be killed in a "kill people" scenario within the context of lunch; human beings were the only thing capable of using the cannon as a weapon. <n>3. People can't be killed with "kill people" because people are not animals.<n>### Input:Florida is a state in the southeastern United States at the Atlantic coast.

This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Deciding to watch tv or play with your cell phone might be a routine but they provide no help in being able to do what? Choices:  A: have tv B: fall asleep C: learn D: sitting E: dancing<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Rationales: The question is asking for the two activities that would provide help in being able to ___ (do XYZ). It is important to distinguish between activities that lead to the ___ (do X) and activities that help to ___ (do YZ). For example, ___ (learn about) something on a TV is different that watching TV (itself). Watching TV doesn't necessarily lead to ___ (learning about), even though it would benefit someone who wanted to ___ (learn about). ____ (Tv watching) and _____ (cell phone usage) would be beneficial for ____ (being able to relax), but it doesn't necessarily help someone to ____ (learn) something. Therefore, we can discard A and B. Learning to SIT on a couch or learning to DANCE in a room would help someone to ____(relax), but not ____ (learn). Even if someone is able to ____ (learn something), the activity of watching TV or playing with their cell phone wouldn't aid in this. In other words, their learning to relax would come ____ (before) or ____ (after) the activity of learning something. Therefore, C, D and E are also inappropriate choices for this role of being able to do a task.<n>Rationales: Only learning would be helpful/appropriate for this task. Therefore, A and B would be reasonable choices, in addition to D and E.<n><n>Answer: D: learning<n><n>### Input:- In the early nineteen hundreds many people believed the earth rotates around the sun.

Choices:  A: station B: every car and house C: shop D: bedroom E: space shuttle<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question is asking where a person is likely to go if they want to buy a radio. The most logical choice is C: shop, because it is the most specific choice that pertains to radio sales, and is, therefore, most likely. The other options are not equally likely. For example, if the choice was station, it would suggest that the radio would be purchased while waiting at a bus stop. This is less likely than purchasing it outside a shop. <n><n>*A: station is too specific and not a likely answer*.<n>*B: every car and house is not specific enough. If a person wanted to buy a radio, they typically would not want to purchase one while waiting in their car or at their home. This means that they more likely would want to purchase at a shop, which is a more likely location than every car or house combined*.<n>*C: shop is a more specific and likely answer*.<n>*D: bedroom is less likely as it implies the person wants to purchase on-site in their bedroom instead of visiting a shop. This also does not mention that the person is specifically going to purchase a radio, but rather that they want to buy something. This is less specific than the other options*.<n>*E: space shuttle is not a possible location to sell radios, and not likely in this situation*.<n><n>### Answer: C: shop<n>

This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:What would a person do if he or she just woke up? Choices:  A: drink tea B: thank god C: open eyes D: feel angry E: complete sentence<n><n>### Response:		A person who just woke up would not have completed any sentence so option A: drink tea is not correct. Option D: feel angry is not correct as feelings are emotional responses, not a response to something such as completing a sentence. Option C: open eyes is incorrect as opening eyes is an action which happens when someone woke up. <n><n>### Instructions:Write a response that appropriately describes a question.<n><n>## Demonstration: <n><n>Input: What may this quilting pattern have in common?

They will feel as if everyone has abandoned him. <n>Option 4: D, Happiness<n>The divorcing couple probably will feel happy since they will get closure in the sense that they are not in a relationship anymore.  <n>Another reason why they may feel happy after their divorce is because no longer they will be dealing with problems or negativity in their marriage. <n>Option 5: E, Happiness<n>Though they may feel abandoned by people since now their friends may take sides with him or her. <n>His friends will not be willing to meet him for he may not have the same values as them / have a boring personality and they may not like him/ his past / or maybe other.<n>On the day of your wedding, some of your friends are likely to take pictures of the dress you are wearing. <n><n>### Input : You have a task in which you ask someone if they have an unmarried friend married to another person.

Choices:  A: fun B: talent C: learn about D: intelligence E: recognize<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>### Demo and Explanation:<n><n>### Question:<n><n>### Response<n><n>### Rationales:<n>7. I believe the answer is D: intelligence as I have found that intelligence is used when describing a skill or trait a person has. The word "knack" used to help describe a special skill someone has. While everyone was saying that she had skill with entertaining they could have also said she had a talent for entertaining. However they do not say she had, a talent. This is because talent also means having more of a natural ability or talent. When entertaining is used it is simply being used in reference to it being a skill that she has.<n><n>### Question2<n>I think the definition of entertaining is that of something which brings pleasure, so I think the best answer will be A: fun.<n><n>### Why?<n><n>### Rationale:<n>2. I believe that 'fun' is the keyword for this phrase. In my dictionary fun is defined as the enjoyment, amusement, or excitement which comes from doing something. I also know that they are asking for your definition of the word 'entertaining'. I don't see entertaining being defined in the dictionary as'something which brings pleasure' since that is not the only definition. The only other definition they have is as being amusing entertainment, which does not give me the feeling that the sentence can be rephrased like it is asked for. The sentence states that everyone believed that she had fun and was a natural at doing it, that is what they are looking for your definition of the phrase to be. The only definition of fun that I can think of that would be suitable and be in context, with the rest of the sentence without rephrasing, I believe is that of the enjoyment or amusement that comes from doing something.<n><n>### Final Answer:<n>A: fun<n>### Why:<n><n>### Ratios:<n>1. I agree, I would use the phrase pleasure or that something brings them pleasure.<n><n>### Rates:<n><n>### Why: <n><n>### Rate:<n><n>### Demorise:<n><n>### How:<n><n>### Conclusion:<n>1. 'fun' is the correct answer choice for this question.<n><n><n><n><n>```<n>

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Dave put his beer where he could get to it, but it would be off the floor.

Choices:  A: loss of consciousness B: relaxation C: snoring D: dreaming E: talking<n><n>### Response:		A correct response is "D. dreaming."<n><n>#### Justifications:<n>- I believe the wording is pretty explicit here.<n>- As mentioned before, if a human is going to sleep their consciousness is being lost, therefore they will be unconscious; as the choice "A" reads "the loss of consciousness" - it is the only phrase that is accurate to the task<n>- I found an article in the New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/business/25brain.html) that discussed "1. Consciousness – the human brain is capable of a large amount of rapid processing and decision making. A loss of consciousness can be caused by numerous things such as drugs, alcohol, or traumatic brain injury. If the brain is experiencing a loss of consciousness, the person cannot make informed decisions, thus causing them to behave irrationally." <n>- Again, this choice matches the choice "A": the loss of consciousness<n><n>### Input What is not a reason for an individual to attend classes in the morning?

This is probably saying that it isn't an excuse to skip a morning class, not that it's not an excuse to leave the house in general. <n>- This choice assumes that if the individual is coming from work at night, they are taking a class at the same time in the morning.<n><n>### Input One important thing you need to do before you leave work...

Choices:  A: appear suddenly B: bottom out C: go downtown D: scream E: roll over<n><n>### Response:		<n>A and B: are not used as nouns. <n>C: should not be used because salesman is a verb phrase. <n>D: is a verb and therefore not used as a noun.<n>E: is not a verb. Because there is not verb in the sentence.<n><n>### Answer:<n>Therefore, the best answer is D: scream.<n><n>### Input : What does a toy look like when you have been playing with it for a long time<n>Choices: A: same B: new C: different D: broken E: used<n>Rationales:<n>1. Toy is an adjective here. The word toy is describing what the toy looks like when you have been out playing for a long time.<n>2. The question states is a toy.<n>3. The answer choice toy is a noun.<n>4. Therefore the correct answer is C: different.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>### Answer Option: C: different<n><n>### Input  : There are four types of weather; rain, snow, sleet, and hail.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:In what place could you find air that has been breathed by many people recently? Choices:  A: charming B: space shuttle C: house D: train station E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. The question is looking for a setting in which the air has been breathed by a lot of people.<n>2. We know that each of the choices is an environment that has been exposed to air.<n>3. 1. A charming place (A) includes a room, whereas the others are spaces with multiple entries and exits, where you would expect to find many people.<n>4. 2. Choice B: space shuttles (B) is an area of air which has been breathed by one person (astronaut), however it would seem impossible to say it’s been breathed by _many_ people.<n>5.  3. A house (C) is likely not a setting where air has been breathed recently by many people. If so, we must consider _who_ is residing there.<n>6. A house could be a residence of a single family that rarely has visitors. <n>7.  4. On the other hand, a train station (D) is a high-traffic area of air that has been breathe by many people. So, the answer choice is D: train station.<n>Air that has been breathed recently can be found in a house, however, it likely has not been breathed by _so many_ people recently that it would be considered _charmed_. <n>

It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning.

Choices:  A: airport B: car C: jewelry store D: garbage can E: laundry room<n><n>### Response:		When you are traveling in a plane your personal belongings are transported to the cargo hold of the airplane and the baggage claim carousel is used in a variety of places to take home your luggage from an airplane. A travel bag is a type of bag that is used for traveling or vacationing. Some people wear the same pair of pants repeatedly or they have the travelers same item of clothing as a set of pajamas. The bag that you carry your personal belongings with is called travelwear. In addition traveling items include clothing items, bags, and suitcases so that travelers can be more versatile.<n>Another place where you may encounter that netted drawstring bags are in a shopping mall or a grocery store where customers tend to place items that may not fit into a bag. The netted drawstring backs are often used in laundry or a dry cleaning facility due to their small size. However, some netted bags are larger and are used for storing large and loose items like blankets and coats.<n><n>### Discussion:<n>### Question:Why did I choose C: store?<n>```<n>The question asked about luggage found at "what" sort of place. The bag found at an airport, car, jewelry store, garbage can, and laundry room is a travel bag.<n><n>Therefore the correct option is C: store.<n>```<n><n>### Question: Why did I not choose B: laundry room as an option and the other options as incorrect?<n>```<n>One of the options was garbage can, and I was looking at this as a place where you throw your garbage away. However, if you take a closer look at the question this is a different garbage can, hence option B: laundry or dry cleaning facility is a better answer.  <n>```<n><n><n>### Question #2:<n>### Write a response that appropriates answers the following multiple choice question and explains how you came to that answer.<n><n>### Input 1:Where might someone find a large bag that had a zipper closing that would not be of much use to them if they needed a large bag that could hold many items?<n>### Instruction1:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n>### Demonstonations:<n>

Choices: <n>A: a company's success B: an interview process C: an employee's performance D: employees' potential to grow <n>Rationales: The word momentum is frequently applied to a job opportunity. It is used to describe how the potential of the business or company may lead to further growth and success.<n>1. An interview process (C) is what the job opportunity is looking for, and not the word momentum. A company's success (A) is also a wrong answer because the two terms cannot be synonyms - one denotes a person and the other denotes a business.<n>2. A person can have potential (B), but the word momentum cannot only relate to the business or a company being interviewed.<n>3. There is also no such thing as "Employee's potential to grow" (D)<n>4.

This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3.

Choices: <n>#A: college dorm B; back pack C: classroom D: backpack E; office supply store<n>### Rationales:1. The question asked for a binder typically used within a school. It is therefore unclear as to whether the binder will be for personal or academic use. Both college dorms (A) and classrooms (C) are associated with schools; a binder would be more useful when going to college than for a backpack (B), and they are often used for academic purposes in schools. 2. Oftentimes, office supplies stores will sell notebooks and similar items which are often used for school, but do not sell as many other necessary items for college life (like dorms and back packs). 3. So if you need a binder, college dorms (C) and classrooms (A); both of which are more likely to have binders and related supplies to sell than office supply stores.<n>    <n># Input & Outputs<n>###  A: college drom <n>

Choices:  A: working out B: sore C: get tired D: satisfaction E: falling down<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Certainly. There are many factors that could potentially influence feelings towards running, and there certainly are plenty of activities that can follow a run. For instance, if the person was able to take a brief breather after a run, the post-run routine could include a cool shower, a warm meal, a nap and a nice stretch with some ice on the muscles. If this scenario were to play out, the post-run feeling may include a bit of exultation, a feeling of success, and some much-needed rest. With that said, after any kind of run a person is probably most likely going to feel tired and maybe even a little sore, depending on how intense the workout. The correct answer would be C, that a person would feel tired after running. <n><n>### Rationale<n><n>The context of the question indicates that "going for a run" would most likely be a form of exercise, which would leave most people to feeling a little sore. Another reason is that the question doesn't make sense to assume that one would be running out of breath after running for a minute. But if one were to "run for miles," then it would make sense that they'd stop in order to catch their breath. The rest of the question is rather ambiguous and includes a lot of activities that don't really mesh with the premise of running in the first place.<n><n>### Additional Instructions: The following multiple choice questions will be used to assess your understanding of the English language.

The question is not asking for specific characteristics of Mary. Rather, it is asking for a common trait of Mary's that makes her relatable to people.<n>2. We know that people like Mary because she is what (E). <n>3. This can mean either: a. People can choose Mary as a friend. <n>b. People perceive Mary to be an attractive person to have as a friend, regardless of what she does. <n>4. We cannot use choice because if Mary is bad, it means she makes bad choices, which would not be someone people generally like to have as friends.<n>5. This brings us to option E: choice. <n>6. We can conclude that Mary was easy to make friends with; people found her easy to choose as someone to be friends with.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.

Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:The competition was to see who would be the last one the drop the object, the hard part was you had to have your arm extended straight out while what the object?

So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:Along what feature will you find a rosebush?

Choices:  A: strain B: though C: happiness D: realization E: understanding<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales<n>1. There are a few options that will complete the question in a way that makes sense, but none of these options are the intended answer by the author.<n>2. Option 'A' could be correct, as it does state that the man was reading letter after letter, however, it's describing that the print is extremely small, and the author is describing the type of'strain' that will have to occur on the eyes to read such'small print'.<n>3. This is incorrect because 'B' mentions the opposite, as it includes 'though'.<n>4. 'C' mentions 'happiness', but that has nothing to do with the eye, nor does it make any sense to suffer eye what, when the only thing happening to the eye is the straining to read, nothing is being 'done' to the eye that would make the man happy. <n>5. Likewise to option 'D', it talks about realization, but this is also not relevant in terms of the eye.<n>6. Option 'E' could be correct, though slightly ambiguous. It talks about 'understanding' for which letters the print would be reading. <n><n>### Instructions:Which of the following choices was not one of the options written before the task question?<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>Input: In the book The Little Prince, where does the Little Prince come from?

Choices:  A: lie down B: run away C: bite D: keep alive E: feel pain<n><n>### Response:		I have to agree with you about your response for this one. The question is simply whether the wild animals will feel pain or not. As per your answer choice, wild animals will feel pain.<n><n>Rationales:1. The reason for this is that wild animals, by nature, are not humans. Thus, this is a violation of the law of nature of animals, given that animals do not feel pain.<n>2. Option A: lie down is not appropriate for this question because animals have no means of speech and thus could not tell us that they feel pain.<n>3. Option B: run away does not apply because unless the animals already have means to speak to us, they cannot tell us that they feel the pain, and thus, will not run away.<n>4. Option D: keep alive is not possible, as we are violating the natural order of animals to ask them to feel pain in the first place.<n>5. Option E: feel pain makes the most sense here. This is because wild animals are not human, and thus, cannot lie down or run away. As such, their choices for their natural reaction to touching people is either to hide or feel pain. <n>Because of this reason, option E: feel pain is the correct answer.<n><n>Answer: E: feel pain<n>

This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer.

He could be in a park, where he might also sit on a bench and feel at rest, but he might be more energized sitting on a bus or waiting at a gym if it were closer and available for him to join in doing the hobby too.\n\n### Answers:\n\nA) park is a garden but not necessarily a state park.\nB) There aren't any bus depots in state parks.\nC) There aren't many gardens with benches or places to sit.\nD) He's in the garden after putting in hours of labor on his hobby or he's in a playground sitting on a bench and talking to his friends from the neighborhood - at rest.\nE.

{"text": "A\n\nInput: A company decided to implement a rule that prohibits the use of cell phones in the workplace, where do you stand on this? Choices:  a: agree disagree b: disagree disagree c: agree agree d: it depends e: it depends it depends\nRationales: Choices disagree disagree, agree agree, and it depends it depends are all invalid responses, since they do not convey specific views on the cell phone policy.\n1. A company is about to implement a policy that prohibits the use or possession of cell phones on business premises.\n2. It's necessary to answer a question that asks either how you would respond by saying \"I agree on this policy\" or \"I disagree on this policy\".\n   1. The answer has to fall into one of the two options, since it's impossible to answer \"it depends on it depends.\" You cannot agree with a policy and disagree with it at the same time.\n3. The remaining choices are all positive responses, so these have to be selected and used as answers.\n4. Choices a it depend is the only answer that is invalid for answering this question.\n   1. It depends on the context. In different contexts, it may be different.\n   2. The answer should reflect how you feel about the cell phone policy and indicate whether you agree or disagree.\n5. However, other responses require you to first state how you respond to the policy, then express whether you hold similar or opposite views to that response.\n   1.

{"text": "Answer The following multiple choice question. \n\n### Demostration:\nInput: There are 10 people who are part of a group. Each person brings a certain amount of money to make a total of $150. Each person brings an equal amount of money to make the total be the same $150. How many people do not bring $55. Choices:  A. 1 B. 2 C. 4 D. 5 E. 7\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about a group of people and how much money they brought to make a total of 150.\n2. There could be multiple answers, but we need to consider which is best.\n3. The given options include \"each person brings an equal amount...\", \"each person brings a certain amount...\", \"each...brings $55\", \"there are 10 people... money in total\", and finally, \"there are 150. The final option is not a realistic answer because each person brings only the same amount of money that everyone else brings.\n4. The options that fit most closely without leaving any \"blanks\" are \"each... brings a certain amount of...\" and \"each...brings...\".\n5. Since both these can be paired to \"each person brings a total amount of $150\", we can infer that the actual option would be \"each person brings a sum of 150.\" This is further corroborated by the \"but each person brings an equal amount... to make the total be as $150.\" which implies that each person brought the same quantity.\n6. However, \"each person brings an amount equal to the sum\", \"each person brings an... amount as...\", \"each person brings $75\", and \"each person brings $55 or $200\" could not form a logical answer in the situation provided.\n7.

{"text": "Option: E:post office\n\n\n### Instructions:Use the following guidelines to write an essay.\n### Directions:Describe what is likely to happen if you go skydiving, but don't fasten your parachute. \nWrite a response that appropriately describes what is likely to happen to you if you go skydive and don't fasten the parachute after opening the canopy. Specifically, use the first person voice when describing what will likely happen, and avoid cliches and stereotypes when writing your response.\n\n    ### ANSWER###\nThis is a scenario describing what is likely to happen as a result of failing to fasten a parachute.  When people start with this action, parachuting is an activity that requires extreme caution and precision. To open a parachute in this activity, there is an opening process for the parachute. It is critical that individuals follow the guidelines for skydiving precisely because they involve the potential for extreme consequences.\n\nThe reason people are so careful about these activities is that if the procedure isn't followed precisely the parachute may become loose or even fall apart. As a result, skydivers are required to attach their harness to the parachute with a backup system and then open the device. This additional step is necessary to ensure that the parachute doesn\u2019t fall apart while in use. The act of wearing one\u2019s own harness, back-up system, and parachute together is known as the \u201crigging-up.\u201d \nIf the skydiver fails to follow these procedures, the parachute may collapse. This is an example of an activity that will result in severe injury and even death. \nThese activities are not fun or frivolous. They are essential to the safety of the skydivers as well as those within the environment surrounding the activity. In essence, wearing one\u2019s harness is a life-saving tool. \nThis essay has provided details about a scenario involving something that is dangerous, such as skydiving.\n\n### Input - Instructions:\n\n### Directions\nWhen performing your tasks, use the following guidelines.\n\nGuidelines to help you write your response\n\n1.

However, I was also concerned about what the food would do to the body. Therefore what should I do? Choices: A: stop taking the diet B: stop exercising C: stop eating at expensive restaurants D: stop drinking coffee E: go to gym\n\nRationale: \n1. The question asks about the most suitable strategies that a person could employ to be more productive and also to avoid affecting their diet.\n2. There are 5 choices: stopping consuming the diet, a stop in exercising, a stop in going to expensive restaurants, and a stop in consuming coffee and going to the gym.\n3. Among them, choice D, stop drinking coffee and go to gym, is the one that can suit both productivity and diet.\n4. This is followed by choice E, stop exercise, however, this can only increase the productivity of the individual, but would not be suitable for the diet.\n5. Choice C, stop going to expensive restaurants and A, stop eating a diet, are not suitable, since this would break the diet and also be unproductive to the individual.\n6. So the most apt response is D, stop drinking \ncoffee and go to the gym. As for choice B, stop exercising, which can increase productivity, it could inadvertently be detrimental to diet and, for this particular individual, it is not necessary, given that he is already dieting.\n7.

Let's start by eliminating any option in which a set is requested. If the request is for \"all three\" in the same set, we would have received that from choice A. Likewise, choice C contains the word \"one set\" which already includes the \"one\u2026each\" phrase. Furthermore, choice E specifically states that no option includes all of the requests.\n4. We can eliminate B since it doesn't include all items nor does it match the phrase \"none of the above.\"\n5. From here, it should be easy to recognize that choice D: \"two of each\" is the best choice since the shoes and handbag can both be purchased in two of each.\n6.

Choice A is a good choice as it encompasses the largest of US States and Michigan is a portion of this State (which explains its presence in Choice B, American City). However, being in Michigan still has several cities and metropolitan areas, among which include Detroit and Grand Rapids, and as such option A gets eliminated, as it is too narrow.\n2. B: Michigan\nThis is another option that encompasses an entire area, which is also a good choice, as no other US State has a name which can be used when describing a portion of the area. As such, this has become the best option.\n\nAnswer: Michigan (B), as it encompass the entire State\n\n### Part 2: What gets worse closer to area\n\nChoices:\nEliminate :\n\n1.

The question is seeking an answer that describes a feature or purpose of the term 'invasive species'.\n2. Each of the options describes a particular aspect of the term or how it may be applied; only one is the correct answer.\n3. We can eliminate choices C, 'an animal that is trying to spread territory', and E, 'a plant or tree that lives in the area'.\n4. While invasive species are introduced to spread to other territory, spreading is not the primary purpose of an invasive species.\n5. And a species is not necessarily any plant or tree that happens to live in the area in which we consider it an invasive species. Choices C and E are ineffective for different reasons.\n6. Choice A, 'a plant or animal that has taken over a new territory', can be eliminated because this does not describe the purpose of the species. An invasive species has the intended motive of spreading to take land and resources, but we do not consider all plants and animals that spread a problem.\n7. Choice D, 'an organism that is trying spread to other territories', is not directly appropriate, either. Though organisms are involved, and they may be trying to take over territories, the important trait is the actual act of spreading; this is not the most important aspect of what an invasive species is.\n8. So, we are left with options B and D, but only one, is relevant to the question.\n9.

This is followed by some of the possible choices: \"get fat\" and \"typing words\"\n3. \"Getting fat\" is listed as a choice, but does not adequately address the question because: \n  1. it does not state what is being accomplished through watching television (i.e. wasting time).\n  2. it is not directly related to accomplishing nothing.\n4. The other options \"get fat\", \"typing words\", \"falling asleep\", and \"wasting time\", which also describe actions someone can take when watching television, only emphasize the negative impacts of watching television (wasting time and falling asleep). \n5.

{"text": "D: Have lunch\n\n### Rationale:\nWhat the sentence is asking for is what someone does because of being hungry in the middle of the day.\n\nBy looking at the definitions of the answers, we can understand what each of them refers to.\n\n- A: C-Cook dinner - refers to preparing food before eating. Thus, cannot be the answer due to an odd-even pattern in the wording.\n- B: B- Make bread - refers to preparing something from scratch (bread). We know it comes after \"in the middle of the day\", so it excludes \"baking\" from the answers. In addition, it is about making bread, so it is not what a person eats in the middle of the work day.\n- C: D- Eat in restaurant - is, according to the definition dictionary, eating in a food place outside one's home. Since we know that a person is eating at home, it is excluded as an option.\n- E: E- Make bread - as for the option \"E\", it does refer to make bread, but does not say what the context is which we are given.\nAccording to its definition, it refers to cooking/baking bread which doesn't really fit in with \"make bread\" the question said.\nHence the option that it refers to is \"D - Have lunch\".\n\n### Input : What will happen to someone who is trying to be in control of their life even if it is too late for them to do anything?

We know that we are trying to be in control over someone's life as they are dying. We are trying to help the person be in control but what will someone have control over if he/she had lost? That doesn't make much sense. That person will have no control over anything at all and therefore, not being in control of their life won't make any sense.

E: Drag any item and drop it in the \"Trash\" area.\n\n### Response\n- The answer is C: you can open the \"Trush\" option and move it to any outher pile. The best thing on this is that: Choice A is not a good idea because it involves clear items from the selection. Choice B is not a good idea also because it involves clear item in the selection.

If you don't take the time to enjoy your meal while it's still warm, you would just feel like it's a mess. Additionally, it is possible for you to feel the rush of happiness if you were still able to prepare the food yourself and cook it.

This implies that they are related to the feeling that one would be experiencing after eating in bed, rather than the experience of eating in itself.\n\n### The answer is 'pleasure'.\n\n### Demystification:\nThe original text in this question is as follows:\n\nEating breakfast in bed _____________.\n\nAssuming that you don't \nspill anything.\n\nThis question is a tricky one because it contains both ambiguous and vague words and phrases, as well as implicit questions. The ambiguous and vague words are: 'assuming that you don'r \nspill anything', which have been left in the original text for reference.

{"text": "The best answer is A: tennis elbow.A person may experience tennis elbow if they play tennis for years. The phrase \"years of playing tennis\" is a noun phrase. For the phrase to be understood properly, context matters: we know this refers to tennis-playing people, so we can infer from this that the phrase describes a person who plays and has played at the same time for many years. The answer is most likely to be \"years of playing,\" so we can check the response options and see which has the phrase contained in them. We can rule out anything else that doesn't include \"years of playing\" (i.e. C and D). We can also cross out E because it's not a good verb to use here (as far as context shows), so the verb choice is B. We can eliminate everything else by applying these criteria. The response is A: tennis elbows.A: tennis elbow: is a common injury occurring from overuse of the area around the elbow that causes pain. This occurs most often in the tendons that attach bone to muscle so it is common in those who play sports. B: proffesion player: indicates an overuse injury like tennis elbow because proffesional players tend to play for many years and therefore would be at risk for this injury. It is the most common injury among professional tennis players, however it can happen to anyone who plays tennis on a regular basis, regardless of skill level. It doesn't necessarily indicate any additional damage from other factors such as age, stress, etc.. This phrase alone won't tell us if someone has this condition or not. C: exercise: is simply another noun sentence that describes playing tennis which should already be eliminated since we already know what year's means based on context so D does not need further rationale before elimination because E: becoming tired already doesn't hold any more value than any other word choice when describing whether someone would get tired after playing tennis.", "answer": "A: tennis elbow"}

{"text": "### Input\n\nThe garage had light <u>sensors</u> and automatic doors.  \n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. The first word in the passage 'The garage had light' is adjective to describe the 'automated doors' mentioned in the first sentence. \n\n2. Choices A, B, C and E, refer to the location or the building itself. Therefore choice D can be excluded\n\n3. The second sentence that is 'and automatic doors' does not offer any additional information as to what kind of house the garage is part of. \n\n4. Choice B is incorrect because the house that the garage belongs to can be a part of a townhouse, but the townhouse itself is part of a larger 'buildings' which is a broad category that doesn't fit within 'the garage'. \n\n5. Choice C 'townhouse' is incorrect for similar reasons as B. \n\n6. As we can see in the sentence structure, the phrase 'the garage belonged to a' would make this choice correct since 'a' is a noun phrase that can be part of a townhouse or modern house. \n\n7. This reduces the choices to E or B.\n\n8. However E is the only option that makes a correct sense to 'The garage'\n\n9. There can't be a townhouse inside a modern house and thus excludes E. \n\n10. This can be further clarified by rephrasing the sentence 'The garage belonged to a modern house' is correct as it refers to a'modern garage' in the modern house.\n\n11.

Choices: 2,A,C,E : for emergency and food B,D: to cook Dinner C,E: to cook Lunch A,C: to keep in the warm place \nRationales:1. To choose the best option one we need to know what the purpose of the trip is. To do that we need to first understand the questions, so:2. The question is asking why someone should bring two tins of bean and the choices are:\n3.

B - to cook dinner (lunch would come if staying at motel or hotel)\n5. D - to cook dinner (but we don't know if that person is planning to eat it or pack it for dinner the other night)\n6.

Thus, we can eliminate the choice A as the answer since \u201ccandle\u201d does not reflect a sense of simplicity.\n\nChoice B: Bed: this seems to be a logical answer, as most houses have at least one bed. However, the answer does not consider simplicity (what is the most obvious and easiest to recognize?) and objectivity (\u201caccording to the text\u201d).

Choices: 1: light exposure A: 2: hair is a plant B: 3: growing older C: 4: hormonal imbalance D: 5: food allergies E: 6: genetics F: \nRationales:\n\n1. light exposure- Exposing one's hair to sunlight or other types of light can cause it to change color. The natural pigment within the hair's follicle breaks down in sunlight, causing the hair to lighten over time.\n  (This is why most people find that their hair changes color as they get older because their skin gets lighter with age, which causes their hair to change color as well.)\n\n2. hair is a plant- Hair is a part of the human body, often described as a 'plant'. However, this is not a cause of hair color changing.\n\n3. growing older- As people grow older, their hair often begins to whiten, which can cause it to appear lighter in color.\n\n4. hormonal imbalances- A lack of specific hormones needed for hair color can result in discoloration. (For example, dietary supplements such as iron and zinc, which help to maintain the hair's pigment, are necessary for maintaining the natural color of hair.)\nHowever, hormonal imbalancings is not the main factor involved in the cause of changes in hair color.\n\n5. food allergies- An intolerance or sensitivity to certain foods can cause an irritation in the skin follicles, which can cause the hair to become more prone to breakage, exposing the dark or light hair pigment underneath. \nThe appearance of light or dark gray hair is a common result of this process.\n\n6. genetics- Genetics play a large role in determining your hair color.

A \"store front\" may refer to retails shops or office buildings, where trash receptacles are generally placed outside of their main buildings in areas where employees and customers can properly dispose of their garbage. Because this description excludes a trash can in everyday environments, this is an invalid choice, as well.\n6.The correct answer, \"C\" or \"corner\", is a likely place where people can find a trash receptacle. This is because \"corner\" is a common street intersection or pathway where people are exposed to and likely to interact with trash cans.\n\n### Reference:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4L5j2Y-vJu8", "answer": "C: corner"}

D: _North America_ \u2014 it is not North America that is abusing the animals, it is the people, so John does not necessarily need to avoid North America any more than he would need to avoid other people\n5. _Park_ \u2014 this is a question specifically about _parks_ so we know that parks are a place that Jons _does_ goes to and he does not want to avoid this\n6. _Animal_ \u2014 if all animals were abused, then all animal is the answer to the question\n7. John would not go to any place specifically to avoid animal abuse, so he certainly would not avoid a pet store, parking lot and a park that sells, is located near and has dogs in it. Animal abuse has been known to happen in parking lots but this does not mean that parking lots are places john avoids going to because he does not want to see abuse animals in parking lots.

Choices: A: everyone would flock to the door B: travelers will be asked to sit C: airport operations will stop D: lights will be dimmed  E: some passengers will be delayed F: flight delays will occur\nRationales:1. The question is what would occur if the power goes out at the airport. A) Everyone would flock to the doors. This choice does not make sense. At the airport, the doors are not locked and passengers are encouraged to leave the airport in case of an emergency such as fire. Also, in an emergency situation, no one flies to the door to board the plane immediately.B) Travelers will be ask to sit. Since the power has gone out, the airport operators might take the opportunity to inform travelers that in case of an emerged, it would be safer to stay seated, as opposed to flocking to the door.\nC) The airport operations will stop. The airport would probably not halt operations.\nD) The lights will be dimmed. Power is not only for lights. There are many things running in the airport with power, such as baggage handling and airport security systems.\nE) Some passengers will be delayed. Some passengers might experience delays if the power is interrupted for a brief time, but delays are not inevitable in this scenario.\nF) Flight delays will occur, as the flight crew are likely to wait for the power to be restored before taking off the plane.\nThe best answer for this scenario is F: flight delays.

Choices:  Choices:  A B C D E: F: G: H: I: J: K: L: M: N: O: P: Q: R: S: T: U: V: W: X: Y: Z: A bad choice is good when it's made with good intentions\n\nRational: What is meant by a 'good choice' is a decision from which you derive a positive outcome. It has nothing to do with the intention behind the decision. To illustrate, you can make the \"best of bad choices.\" While it would be ideal that you consistently make the \"right\" choice, doing so isn't always an option. And sometimes, an \"unwise\" choice can lead to a positive outcome. Take, for example, a student who intentionally takes all the \"wrong\" classes - including a course in a subject that isn't required - but is fortunate to have a teacher who gives them a better chance of getting a passing grade through extra study sessions. This bad decision ultimately results in a better outcome. You could also make the bad choice of buying a worthless item under the assumption that it will be worth something someday - only later to be disappointed when it doesn't increase in value. In this scenario, it would undoubtedly be a \"bad\" choice, but even bad choices can be a great learning experience, particularly those resulting in loss, because the experience is a lesson you're able to take for the future.\n\nThe confusion arises when someone misinterprets the word \"good\" and thinks it means a positive outcome is guaranteed.\n\nAnswer: Q: R: \n\n### Instructions: This is not a test, but it is the same format as a test, the choices are the correct ones unless otherwise specified.\n\n### Exam\n\nQuestion 1\n- You need to know how to apply the basic formulas of algebra to the word expressions to solve for specific values.\n- The formula for solving for the", "answer": "E: save money"}

This indicates that the desk is usually occupied by a child, and is not used by an adult.\n\n2) The candidate responses include: office building, schoolroom, library, bedroom, and gym. We can eliminate the two locations, schoolroom and library, because young children normally do not attend school after kindergarten, and are much too young to be attending a library by themselves.\n\n3) Bedrooms are used for sleeping at night, so cannot reasonably contain a desk that does not serve to keep someone awake.\n\n4) A gym, then, is the other end of the spectrum, requiring more strength and coordination. We can, then, more easily rule out gyms as a probable location for the desk.\n\n5) This leaves us with two locations: a gym and an office building. An office building is more likely to contain an assigned seat, rather than just desks. This gives us the answer to be: A: office building.", "answer": "B: schoolroom"}

A vehicle for astronauts to utilize for food transportation may be an oven, but it's highly unlikely that astronauts would take frozen food on an oven. Additionally, the description of the process suggests that freeze-dried food is intended to be taken to outer space, which requires a special purpose vehicle, rather than a traditional oven for preparing food.

Although choice A, laugh is a potential response, a child going to play is not likely to make someone laugh. Laughter occurs after an amusing incident and would occur during or at the end of the play session. Therefore, it could be considered an effect of play and not a response to play. Thus, we choose to eliminate answer D.\n3. The only options left in the list are A which is 'laugh' and E which is 'walk slowly'.

We can eliminate option B, relaxation, immediately because the response does not indicate relaxation due to non-capability in playing violin.\n4. Option E, loud noises, is a response that may sometimes happen when playing violin but not applicable to the scenario of the question, as the question is about the scenario of a person's emotional state after losing in playing violin, not the outcome of playing violin. Therefore, we can eliminate option E.\n5.

We can rule out option C, since an office is a specific location, and we are looking for measurement in general.\nSimilarly, option B, \"England\", is also inapplicable as we are asked for a place to find multiple units.\nFor option E, \"desk\", we can rule it out because it is a specific object and not a place to find measurement.\nThus, the only plausible choice is \"drawer\" since it is a place where measuring sticks, a ruler, and other measurement tools can be found.\n\n### Example 2:\nQuestion:What is the term for the area of knowledge, art or skill that combines scientific investigation and technological applications?\n\n*Answers:\n* Choice (A) - scientific application\n* Choice (B) - biophysics\n* Choice (C) - technology\n* Choice (D) - technology application\n* Choice(E) - technology skill.\n\nAnswer: C: technology\n\nQuestion:What is a term for the area of investigation or study including the processes of nature and principles of life?\n\n*A: Biophysics\n* B: Biology\n* C: Biology\n* D: Technology\n* E: Technology\n\nAnswer: A: Biophysics", "answer": "C: office"}

Since the sign says nothing about money, the response is incorrect. Therefore it can be eliminated.\n\nThe response B: advice is also an indirect response. The sign does not specify an advice, but rather a job position. Since the sign says \"Deli Counter Manager' is a job position, this response is irrelevant.\n\nThe response C: a job is a direct response. Since the sign said \"Deli Position Available\", this response is correct.\n\nThe response D: an apartment is an incorrect response as it does not involve a delicious food item, rather an apartment. Since no delicious meal mention is on the sign, this response can be ruled out.\n\nThe response E: the phone is incorrect. Since no mention of the phone is made on the sign. Hence, it can be ruled out. The sign says \"Deli Position Avail\". Deli position involves managing a delicious food item.

For instance, Choices B and C say the answer is a country, but it isn\u2019t even on the list of countries: all other countries are not valid to Google services.\nIt is important to check for any other constraints such as the answer being on the list of countries or being mentioned in the instruction, but this is an optional check. For this problem, all of the constraints appear in the choice set.\n\nThe next step is to generate all of the possible combinations and then check if any of the options is correct. A single choice will not necessarily be correct but every combination can be used to create the correct answer. For this problem, it is important to remember that there is no need to try to generate every possible combination: if you are just doing two choices there are only two possibilities, but for six choices there are 26 possibilities.\nFor example, using only Choices A and E, each one gives a possibility of sixteen, or (A + E) to the power of two: A E A E E A A E E A E \u2013 E E.\n\nOnce you have generated all of possible combinations (which is the whole list), then you need to check each one to see if it was correct. This is a long and unnecessary step: you are only looking for 1/6th of the combinations and each combination can be tested against all other in a few short steps.\n\nWith this information in hand, you are ready to answer the question. The way you determine the correctness is to compare it to the choices, and if it is similar, then it is close, but you cannot choose the correctness that matches no option.\n\n### Answer:\n\nInput: Choices: [A] Mexico, [B] mexico, [C] countryside, [D] atlas, [E] oceans,\nOutput: [E] oceas,\nRationales:\nMexico doesn't belong to mexico or country side and atlas or oceans.

However, we can also use\"have\" with a non-subject pronoun like \"my brother, Bill, has a dog\".

Recruiting scientists who aren't biased may lead to more accurate results than using participants who are.

Next, we turn to option B, which may have some value in helping the scientist to execute their plan, but there is no guarantee of success.

{"text": "> I'm going to answer this question by breaking it down in to several parts. To begin, we're asked to select the best response from a list of options that describes where this individual could try to find the gated home he was looking for. The next section of this answer will cover each of these options in detail.\n\nNext, we'll answer the question \"What is a good location to start looking for a gated house?\" To begin, we'll start by excluding options B, C, D, and E, as they aren't helpful towards a suitable living setup.\n\nStarting off our list is answer choice A, neighborhood. A neighborhood is just one part of what we'd normally refer to as a town or city. Neighborhoods are the smaller sections of a city, or perhaps their buildings and residential areas. A neighborhood will tend to be more affordable than a city or suburb, due to a smaller population, and will be more intimate and close-knit. They can offer various amenities and services but tend to be more rural in nature, like this individual was hoping for. \n\nContinuing with our list would be the next possible choice, a subdivision. A subdivision is a section of a neighborhood that is further separated by land. Subdivisions tend to have a higher home value than simply living within a city or neighborhood, since it's a more private community. They will usually be less populated and have more green space than a city, and should be less susceptible to noise pollution.\n\nNext up is the city. The city consists of various types of dwellings and buildings, from homes to factories and businesses. It's a busy, densely populated area, with more people and buildings than a subdivision or neighborhood. \n\nAfterward would be the less likely location, suburbs. Suburbs tend to have a higher standard of living than simply the city, with larger houses that are surrounded by gardens and trees. Though it's generally safe, it's not as quiet as the country or rural areas due to the more developed and populated nature of a city.\n\nFinishing up the list would be the street. The street is simply the main thoroughfare in a city, and as such is often noisy, crowded, and has a lot of traffic. It tends to be the most busy area", "answer": "B: subdivision"}

Choices:  A : criminal defendant B : civil defendant C : good citizen D : criminal offender E: civil offender\nRationales:1. We must first identify the context of the prompt: a successful citizen. This immediately excludes answers B (civil defendant) and E (civil offender), since these refer to legal issues.\n2. Our second consideration is Choice D: criminal offender, meaning he was convicted of a crime. In the context provided, there is no indication that the old man is a criminal.\n3.

However, in this context, the choices are presented as alternatives to sitting in class, which means that we are looking for things that someone _would_ do, rather than things that someone does not do.\n8.

{"text": "The answer is E: anxiety. The question is looking at the feelings of the person doing the housework, not a description of what might happen to the housework itself.\n\n### Rationale: This question has an answer choice, 'anger', that is a feeling expressed about housework (that it is unpleasant to clean), rather than the feelings of the cleaner (that they are unhappy about having to do the housework). We can eliminate this choice because it does not describe what the person might feel.\n\n### We can also eliminate'stress' because unlike anger, stress is not an emotion. It instead describes an activity or state of the mind, but not a feeling.\n\n### When examining the different feelings, we can see that 'boredom' is also not a reasonable choice because the question is asking for what might happen to the cleaner, not the feelings that might happen to the house. Additionally, 'boredom' is often caused by having to do repetitive tasks such as housework. So it would be inaccurate to say that someone might start to feel bored if having to do housework.\n\n### Finally, we can identify that the answer choice 'annoyed' is not necessary because this answer choice is a similar phrase to 'anger' but just in a different form ('not boredom'). We can rule this out as well as it does not provide the most accurate answer.\n\n### It is also important to note that the question mark after the last sentence of the question indicates uncertainty, which reinforces this idea that we are looking for the answer that best reflects what the person might feel, rather than which feeling housework might have.\n\nInput: I need to be able to reach a person with a particular name.

Committing a crime often results in punishment, but other consequences that can occur include arrest and death.\n## Demonstraion:1. While punishment could be a consequence of this negative action, there are many other consequences.\n2. Arrest is also possible, so that an individual can be taken into custody and/or detained for some period of time.\n3. Death is also a possibility since many crimes have a significant penalties with the risk of permanent incarceration or even the death penalty, for particular crimes.\n4. However, death is not likely to occur due to committing a crime, so this is not the best option. This choice is eliminated.\n5.

{"text": "B - Death.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\nSky diving is an activity that involves jumping out of an airplane, typically with a parachute, and then gliding back to the ground.\nWhen you jump out of an airplane for the first time, your primary concern is whether you'll survive the jump and land safely. However, it's not uncommon for people to experience a short period of disorientation or loss of consciousness known as \"blackout\" before they enter the atmosphere.\nThe combination of high altitude, rapid acceleration, and lack of oxygen can cause a blackout, but this does not always result in death. \nMany people who experience a blackout during a sky dive are able to survive the jump and live to tell about it.\nSky diving deaths usually occur during or immediately after the jump.\nIn the minutes or hours after the jump, a person's vital signs begin to deteriorate, and they eventually suffer cardiac or respiratory arrest, leading to death.\n\nIf the blackout is immediate before the person falls, they would die before opening the parachute.\nIf the person passes out after opening the parachute, they can still land safely.\n\nSo a blackout is not usually death. Death could occur after the blackout if the person does not open their parachute or is unable to open it.\n\n### Input : A rosebush or a deer or other plants and animals and squirrels are part of?

A: We can eliminate this, because though its hiding, a more natural reason why a fox might flee is to avoid hunting, as this is its predator.\n2. B: We can eliminate this because a fox fleeing a predator is an indication of a lack of success as a hunter, and therefore not a valid reason to be fleeing.\n3. C: We can eliminate this in the same way. A hunting season might be a time where a fox would be at its most successful hunting, so it wouldn't be trying to flee, unless it was trying to avoid starvation, which is already covered by E.\n4.

Choice 1: The first option in the list is 24 hr, which is actually the way you would say 24hr in the singular. It shouldn't be plural 24 hrs.\n2. Choice 2: The second option in the list is actually 24 hr, as in 24 hours; however, this should have commas placed around each digit separately to indicate that it is really meant to be: 24, hr, and shouldn't be all in one number. Additionally, the 62 seconds could refer to an analogue clock, which would give the wrong time.\n3. Choices 1 and 2, 24 hr and the analogue with a second hand are incorrect because you can't actually write down the time, since it's in the past and future.\n4. Option 4: The fourth option in the list is 'any time'. This isn't a valid choice, since you can only write down what you can record at that moment.\n5. Option 5: Choice 5, 'none of the above,' doesn't seem to fit to the question at all, since if you wanted to use a type of clock that wasn't included in the choices, you could have simply said 'other' or included your choice yourself.\nConclusion: The only remaining choice that makes sense for this question is 4, 'any time'. You can write the time on the clock as soon as it goes 24 hrs and 60 minutes; whether in the past, present, or future, the time is now.

The question asks about what a master of one's craft has done with said craft. 2. Choice A has been selected.\n3. We can eliminate B, C, D, and E for a few reasons.\n4. B has been selected because it is a synonym for 'to improve'. 'To commit murder most vile' is not related to a master of one' own craft. C has been selected because it describes one who is an 'expert of a vessel'. Similarly, D describes one who is'skilled in a study'. Both 'expert of a study' and 'expert of a craft' are more general and broad terms, and we are looking for a specific and detailed term.\n5. E describes a'specialist of a field'.

{"text": "The purpose of lotion is to soothe skin. So the person likely wanted to do what? Choices:A: fresh smellB: smooth skinC: good creditD: fresh produceE: headache\n\nRationales:\n1. The question is to identify the response the person had in mind when they applied lotion.\n- The response can be a reason (goal) or a result (outcome) of lotion.\n- Reasons include: fresh smell, good credit, smooth skin.\n- Outcomes include fresh produce or headache.\n2. We know these responses can work at any level - person or group.\n3. We can eliminate choices that either do not apply at any level or which do not meet the requirement.\n4. Choices C and D do not work at the person or group level.\n- Choice B does not meet the requirement because the result, smooth skin, is not related to lotion. This may be a consequence, however.\n- Choice E does not work because the result, fresh produce, is not the reason or goal of the person applying lotion.\n- Choices A, B, C and D should all remain on the list for testing until we have eliminated other options.\n5. Choice A should be eliminated. Freshness is a reason, not the goal. Furthermore, a fresh smell can imply an odor, so this is not the response a person would necessarily want. While we can't eliminate odor in most cases, a fresh smell is not what a person wants.\n6. Choices B, C, and D should remain on the list for further testing.\n7. Choice B should be eliminated. This does not work at either the person or the group level.\n8. Choice C should be eliminated. We already know it is a reason, not a goal.\n9. Choice D works at both the person and group level and should remain as an option to test.\n10. Given everything we know so far, only Choice E works as an outcome.\n11.

The options in the multiple choice question are: a neighborhood, an area, a block, a country and a street.\n3. The man's friend is trying to sell his house, so we know it isn't an area.\n- An area is commonly understood as the surroundings, or the place something is in.\n4.

{"text": "A: The correct answer is B. The chemical reaction that is often used as a source of heat is burning, a form of combustion. Burning involves the reaction between organic material like coal or wood and oxygen. The burning releases heat and produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct.

His home and neighbor\u2019s house are places where drinking alcohol is not possible and his only way out is to get a beer from one of them so he goes.\n4. The bridge is not an answer because it is not a place that has beer. The homeless shelter is not an answer because, as an alcoholic, drinking beer is not good for him.

In these circumstances, you have the option of turning the engine on if the distance between your present location and your target destination is greater than that of the plane and the available amount of engine power.

Each incorrect answer is identified with the 'X' icon below.\n\n\nEach choice that makes sense in a scientific experiment starts with the Latin word 'in' or a version of it. The key is that each one does not require a preface. For example, in Vitro is without a preface or a verb ('in') - you just place the word 'Vitro' in front of the root word as the first word of the full word. (This is why the capital 'a' is not needed at the beginning of the words). \n\nIn the 5 th section, you will be asked to choose the most appropriate Latin word to fit the description for each problem. Remember to use the words in the correct order. \n \nFor Example, You are asked 'The in vitro fertilization process in the egg and sperm was very difficult to manage.' \nRemember, the first word you write, in a Latin word, starts with the word 'in' because that is the Latin word for \"in\". The 4 th word in the example is 'Vitro' because it has no preface. The last word is 'fertilization' because is is a noun.\n\nThe second example, you are asked 'The in vivo results in the mouse showed that the drug causes an increase in mortality rate.' \nRemember to start the words with in, because that is the word that is in the middle and you need to identify the first word of the Latin word. In this example, you start with 'in' and follow it with the fourth word 'vivo' since the fourth word starts with a vowel that is not a V. After the fourth word, you write'mortality' because it starts with the letter 'M' and follows it with the term 'rate' since the last word needs to have a 'er' ending. \n\nAfter you write down the initial Latin word, you are to list the answers that have the Latin prefixes and not the root words.

{"text": "I hope that people will stop using hoverboards in the future. They will soon go extinct because, after all, these boards were created for youngsters. To my knowledge, though, they are not even approved by the FDA for people to ride. Hoverboards would not be able to go space because of the low amount of force it provides. On the contrary, the space shuttle is one of the most powerful crafts present at that time and will be in the future. Although public places were made with consideration of space flights in mind, they were not designed for such venture, as space explorers cannot do a lot of activities in public places anyway. As for the supermarket, this is not used in the space travel scenario because supermarkets are not a place that people frequently visit on purpose. I have never heard of anybody planning a trip to a supermarket for fun. But, if this choice was used, the traveling crew could purchase many provisions for the long duration of the trip. However, the space shuttles would be able to deliver food and water to astronauts with much ease. Space Shuttle is much more suitable in that regard, as astronauts can travel far with minimum resources in space. In the end, the answer is either B: roadblock or D: hoverboard.\n\n### Input:\"Who will not get a spacecraft, then?\" Choices:  A. Squirrel. B. Spacecraft. C. Mouse. D.

Choices: \nA: FD medic in an engine company B: Fire Company Medic C: Fire Department Medic D: Ambulance Medic E: Fire Department Medic Supervisor\nRationales: Start by considering the wording of the question. It's phrased to say that a person is a \"fire department medic\" at the task at hand.\nThis means that we must look for jobs where someone would be assigned as a fire department medic.\n\n1. The options we're looking for jobs that fall into one of the following categories: \"FD Medic in an Engine Company,\" where \"FD\" stands for \"Fire Department\";\n2. \"Fire Company Medic\" which is the same category as #1, just with different jargon;\n3. \"Ambulance Medic\" which would fall into another category as a fire department medic, but that's not what we're looking for;\n4. \"Fire Department Medic Supervisor\" which can be used to describe several different job titles.\n\nFrom here, you can see that we can get rid of C because it's redundant with the first option listed. So, the remaining options are E and D.\n\nFinally, we can discard option D -- it says \"Ambulance Medic.\"\n\n5. We can also eliminate E because it says that the fire department medic is a supervisor. While this could be true, we are not specifically looking for titles of supervisors, just jobs.\n\nFrom here we are left with option D. Therefore, we choose option D (\"Fire Department Medic\").\n\nAnswer: D.

The question is about what we call the region of the space that surrounds Earth.\n2. Each answer options represents a different meaning of a particular word which is relevant because the question asks us to pick the meanest one out of the list. \n3.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple choice question\n\n### Democratization:\nInput: The manager had a large number of documents scattered around the office, how should he organize them to keep them most how? Choices:  answer: A: handy B: efficient C: helpful D: organized E: all of these can help\nRationales:\n1. The question is \"How should he organize them so they are most handy/helpful?\"\n2. A handy document is an easy one to find and a helpful document helps you solve a problem. You could have handy notes and helpful books on the kitchen counter and desk, and so it could be argued that handy and helpful could be used together for some purposes. However, both are typically related to the \"user\". For example, if someone has a large collection of books, they might be more \"handy\" (easier to reach) than efficient and organized, as efficient and organized could also be related to \"writer\" as well as to \"user.\"\n3. \"Organized\" also suggests \"system\". If it takes you too long to find notes or books, then the notes and books are not \"organized\" in a \"system\" as it means having a set order.\n4. In general, \"helpful\" is related to the user \"solving a problem\" and not necessarily the way that the information is presented.\n5. A person could find a helpful book, and it could lead to the solution of a \"problem\".\n6. So, \"helpful\" can mean something is \"easily accessible to the user\" while \"efficient\" would be easier to grasp for a \"writer\" as efficient means \"in an optimal manner that preserves or utilizes sources\" for a \"writer's\" use.\n7. Efficient does NOT mean the document is useful to the user.\n8. Even if the writer was also a user, there would be a difference in what they expect to be helpful to them.\n9. So, \"useful\" does not necessarily mean helpful to the user either.\n10. A document can be useful in many different ways, but it does not necessarily mean it is helpful to the user.\n11. Efficiency, then, is more useful to a person than useful.\n12. Being \"organized\" will depend more on the writer's knowledge of what is helpful,", "answer": "A: school"}

We'd expect movement in all directions (around the earth, the sun or the sun's rotation).\nThis question is asking about the sun's rotation.\n1. 'Rotation' describes a circular, orbital movement.

The sun not only rotates around itself, it also orbits around the galaxy.\n4. Therefore, Option 'E' does not fit our scenario.\n5. 'F' is a misconception and we can rule it out. The sun does not rotate around the earth.\n6. 'G' is our answer. The sun does not orbit around the moon, it\u2019s the earth that does the orbiting.\n7. 'H' is our answer.

{"text": "A reckless driver will be subject to injury, fatigue, traffic jams, and possibly accidents as a result.\n### Rationales:\n1. Reckless driving can lead to injury, fatigue (being tired from going too fast), traffic jams (many people slowing down after the reckless driver, leading to delays and congestion), and accidents (unexpected collisions from a sudden breaking or swerving) (source1, source2).\n2. Choice (a) Injuries isn't the best choice, since most serious accidents end in major injury for someone. Choice (c) Traffic jams are the result of drivers slowing down to avoid a reckless driver. However, jams are not caused by driving behavior. Choice (c ) is a poor match for the question. Choice (d) Tiredness is an outcome of the activity (driving) in response to fatigue and reckless driving. Therefore, choice (d ) is correct. However, it's not a complete answer to the question.\n3. The other choices are: (b) Fatigue and (e) Accidents. In the question, we are asked to identify what results from driving recklessly.\n4.

The tiger, being a member of the felidae species, should be the one to tell jokes. B. Although tigers may be very funny, it is unlikely that they would be walking down the hall, so the most likely person would be the hippo saying the joke. The hippopotamus is well known as the world's most comical animal, so it would be the logical choice for telling jokes. C. The elephant is likely to be the largest animal in the room and very large animals can be funny in their mannerisms, but since the elephant has a very high-pitched screech for a laugh, it would be inappropriate to tell jokes that way. D. The hippo can tell jokes all day long, but most people don't find hippos very funny. If it's not what kind of joke the hippo tells, the hippo shouldn't be the one to tell them, because most people don't laugh at hippo jokes.

Choices:\n  A: man\n  B: cat\n  C: misery\n  D: rain\n  E: bad time\n\nRationales\n1.  The question asks us to identify the most suitable substitute for the word 'joy' in place of the word'misery.'\n2.  To do so, we must decide whether the answer is in direct contrast to 'joy' or if the answer can be considered complementary to 'joy.'\n3.

The entire sentence was intended to reference 'this man' and by swapping the answer option to C, the second piece would then reference Michael Jordan.

{"text": "What the woman in the story really means is 'the perfume' she is more of a frugal person.She'd sooner just drink water or wash her face and body with the smell of fresh water.She had to settle and buy the perfume because the perfume was cheaper.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question is about a woman's preferences and choices regarding a particular object, perfume. However, the first word in this sentence and several later references suggest something entirely different to the reader. The word 'it' is not defined as the perfume in the following sentences:\n2. She could've bought it, she liked it, she was going to buy it and buy it she did.\n3. The use of indefinite pronouns 'it' implies this object is something else. We can eliminate the choices 'perfume' and 'air' because they refer to 'it'.\n4. We can eliminate'swamp' because the smell of damp grass is not what the woman dislikes about 'it'.\n5. This leaves three possibilities 'water' (the liquid), 'fountain' (the source of the liquid) and 'puddle' (a body of liquid). The last choice, 'fountain' is unlikely, as this is a fictional story, we are going to assume water here is the liquid.\n6. From here, we can go back to the sentence in which the use of object pronoun 'it' confuses the reader, and determine what option best fits 'it'.\n7. The only option that fits is'swamp'. The water is the liquid and the swamp is where she will find her water, from the source of the fountain or the puddle. Using more pronouns 'her' and 'it' in the following sentences further confirms the swamp is what she doesn't prefer.\n8. There is no other option that fits, therefore the answer is choice B: swamp.\n\nAnswer: B: swamp \n\n### Instructions:", "answer": "A: perfume"}

Since most people believe that water is an essential ingredient in soft drinks, the choice \"D: whirlpool bath\" is not an appropriate choice as the ingredients are different here.\n4.

Answer choice option A, 'high elevation forests', describes the forest as a low or moderate elevation one, so moss would not grow there.\n2. Answer choice option B 'deserts' do not make the same logical connection as the first answer choice. They are completely different environments, and the two are not mutually incompatible.\n3. Answer choice option C 'coniferous forests' is inaccurate because moss grows in dirt and the ground in coniferous forests, not in the trees.\n4. Answer choice option D, 'arid regions', has the same issue as the previous two. It is not in a forest, and therefore not a suitable place to grow moss.\n5. Answer choice option E, 'coastal regions' is incorrect for two reasons: (1) There is no direct connection between moss and coastal regions.

Choices: \nA: antibiotics B: Tylenol C: water D: aspirin E: ibuprofen F: naproxen G: placebo\nRationales: The question is asking for the patient to have been giving or not given a medication previously.\n1. Choices B and E, Tylenol and ibuprofen, can be eliminated because those medications were already taken.\n2. Choices F and G, placebo and naproxen, require an explanation of what they are, which is outside the scope of the question.\n3. This leaves us with options A and C.\n4. Option A, antibiotics, is possible in some circumstances, when the fever is caused by an infection.

The point-of-selle can be in different places in the store like at the front, middle, or back of the store. The point-ofsale device is what prints the receipts for customers who paid using money at a cash register. The devices also store the information needed for reporting the purchases and inventory count to managers through software.\n\n### Rationale\n1. One example of an input where a point of sales machine is used is when a person shops at a grocery or hardware store where the cash register or point-of-sell printer prints receipts and stores records for managers to keep track of inventory. \n\n1. Another example of a scenario where point-of-sels machines are used is when a person orders items from an online store. After ordering, then the store sends the products using a shipping service. Finally, once the products arrive at the store, they are unpacked and taken to the point-of- sells machine where they are counted and reported to the store\u2019s manager.\n2.

A: water B: salt C: blood D: pheromones E: oxygen \n\n### Rationales:\n 1. The question's words, \"missing from their diet,\" are indicative of the missing element being something that is generally found in the diet of the animal.\n2. This is reinforced by the example, \"a squirrel may lick honey from a feeder, but will not eat it.\"\n3. This points in the direction of the answer choice, \"pheromones,\" which, like the missing element, are generally found in the animal diet, even if not always eaten.\n4. The answer \"water\" is not a missing element, as animals must drink water to survive, and the example given in the question does not even mention whether the animals drink water.\n5. The answer \"salt\" is not applicable to all animals, as there are marine animals that do not need salt to survive.\n6. The answer \"blood\" is not a commonly found element in the diet of animals, and even if it were, as in the example animal, it would not be missing from the dieting of the animal.\n7. The answer \"oxygen\" is not necessarily in the \"missing\" category, as it is found in the air and therefore not necessarily missing from an animal's diet.\n8.

C: In any bigger city in the northeastern part of the US, animals are found at the zoo. D: In any bigger city of the northeastern US, animals are found in the zoo. E: In any big northeast US city, animals can be seen, including at the zoo.\nRationales:\n1. The correct answer is D. You can find animals in a northeast city in the US, so your response should start in this way.\n2. The sentence, \"animals can be seen,\" can be found in B. However, this response needs some rephrasing. We need to modify our response to include a specific location.\n3. In response C, 'big,' is not necessary because the first sentence of the sentence already implies that the city is large. You should choose the least number of words that can convey the content of a sentence.\n4. In response E, the correct adjective is 'bigger,' and there is a misplaced word,'many,' which should be after 'animals.'\n5. In response A, you need to add the city you are referring to (e.g.: In any northeaster city in the US, (name the city), you can find animals at the zoo.)\n6.

{"text": "John was disgusted by his roommate's apartment, which was filthy. John thought that he should do laundry, but he did not have enough money to do more than one load.\n\n### Rationale: \n1. The question asked which things in the kitchen John would prefer to be elsewhere, given that everything else was plastic.\n2. The options for what else John would rather be contain both'somewhere else' and 'anywhere else', which are not significantly different to each other, and so can be eliminated.\n3. It's possible that John's preference for glass has a basis in the fact that the material of the cupboard is glass. Therefore, 'cupboard' can be discarded.\n4, John might think the whole kitchen should be cleaned, so he doesn't have to do the laundry. 'The kitchen should be cleaned' is an uncomfortably vague statement, not something a person would just say on its own. We can disregard this option.\n5. John might not be rich enough to hire cleaners to do the heavy lifting, so he'd rather wash the dishes and clean the rest of the apartment himself. Thus, this option is not plausible.\n6. The last option is 'garbage dump'. While John could clean everything himself without financial resources, it's quite unlikely that he wants to handle garbage alone. Garbage can carry pathogens that could make people ill. So, the dishwasher wouldn't have an easy job cleaning just the dishes.\nThere's no need to look further because the best option that fits the sentence accurately is 'garbage dump.'\n7. This option states that John would rather go to the garbage dump in order to clean things himself. Because the options are the same and the garbage dump is the best choice, 'the garbage dump' is the most accurate response. Answer: B: garbage dump\n\n---\n\n## 22\\. 1\\.

{"text": "Choice A because the most appropriate place to choose a glass of wine is art show\n\n### Instructions: What type of person does not normally go to a wine tasting event? Choices: A: someone who only drinks wine B: someone who drinks wine occasionally C: someone who abstains from alcohol E: someone who does not like to try new things F: someone who drinks only red wines\n\nRationales: Choice F, someone who drinks only beer, is incorrect because wine tastings usually include a broader range of wines. Choice C, someone who abstains entirely, is also incorrect as wine tastings offer the opportunity to try new varieties, opening things up to those who don't follow a rigid regimen of drinking. The question is looking only for a wine tasting participant, not a person who does not drink alcohol. This narrows our choices significantly to A, B, and E. We can discard E because although it sounds reasonable, A and B are more accurate.\n\nOption A, someone who only drinks beer, would probably not go to a wine tasing for obvious reasons. They may also try a wine during a regular outing but not with the intention of getting something for themselves. So this rules them out.\n\nOption B, someone who drinks wine only occasionally, is a wine tasting candidate if there are a few wines being sampled. However, if there's a wide array of wines, B may end up buying a bottle or two of the variety they are most interested in, rather than a true tasting. That person may eventually drink some of the other varieties, but probably not at a tasting. And if there's a lot of wines being offered, it could take a few tastings to find anything that seems particularly good. That's not to say it will happen, but with any large selection, most of them will be rejected as being poor quality.\n\nAnswer: B: someone who drinking wine occasionally\n\n### Instances: In which case use are you most able to appreciate wine tasting events?

{"text": "Select the best response\n\n### Answer: \n\nThe most appropriate response is option (E)\n\n### Rationale: \n\n1. As given in the question, the business restaurant is likely to be located in a \"business sector\". According to the ODL Dictionaries and Thesauri, the term \"business sector\" is \"the general part of a city or town where factories and offices are situated, including the surrounding area where people can work in these places.\" The phrase \"business sector\" suggests that the location is in an area with businesses. Hence, the restaurant in question is located near offices and factories, thereby fulfilling the purpose of being called a \"business restaurant.\"\n2. Option (A) is not the best response as \"town\" refers to a settlement with a population of more than 10,000 inhabitants that may serve as a business district. In this scenario, an area where the business sector is located is not necessarily a town as a place where businesses are located may include residential areas and places with large recreational complexes. The population of the place may be as low as 10,029 inhabitants.\n3. Option (B) is not the best as \"at hotel\" suggests that the restaurant is located in a hotel. As given in the problem, we are looking for the location of a business restaurant and are not concerned with the location of a restaurant within a hotel. However, this location is not suitable for a business restaurant. The business sector is the general part of a city with factories and offices, and a business restaurant would not be at a hotel.\n4. Option (C) is not suitable as the mall is a shopping center. While a business restaurant may be located in a mall, malls are not exclusively shopping centers. For example, the Ala Moana Center in Hawaii has a business district within its premises.\n5. Option (D) is inappropriate because it describes a business sector, as given in question.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is option (E) because the phrase \u201cbusiness restaurant\u201d itself suggests that the business restaurant is located in a business district. This district is likely to consist of industrial factories, offices and commercial premises, including a shopping mall to cater to the needs of its employees, which is where most business restaur", "answer": "D: business sector"}

We can assume that'marbles' is a metaphor for something important to James and describes how the loss resulted in him feeling 'distraught' for a week.\nHowever, the question does not provide sufficient explanation of what the 'lost marbles' represent to justify the loss of the marbles to be so devastating that it would cause James to be distraught for an entire week.\n\nWe can only narrow the possible interpretations for'marbles' as being either literal marbles or a metaphor for knowledge or wisdom based on context. \nIn the context of knowledge:\n\n1.

A literal metaphor could be that James is so 'distraught,' that he can no longer take any steps to gain new knowledge. \n\nIn the context of wisdom, knowledge:\n\n1.'marbles' can be metaphorical in its entirety, being that losing his wisdom and knowledge contributed to the week of 'distraught'.\n2.

Maine is located in the north east of the United States, specifically on its border with Canada.

The choice C (traveling) would be relevant if the person was traveling a lot but the reason we want to know is \"regularly not attending classes.\" Answer B (traveling) is not the most logical choice, there are many other things that may cause someone to be traveling other than class attendance.\n3.

Choices A and B, inebriated and armed with a driver's license, are not the bride and groomed after the ceremony. Inebriation is unrelated and would occur before or after the ceremony. The driver's license is not related because the bride and grooem will typically be issued a driver's license before or after the ceremony, not by it.\n\n3.

{"text": "### Rationales:\n1. The response must indicate an appropriate choice that aligns with the context.\n2. When reviewing each of the option selections, we can see that option A: \"winners and losers\" is not directly relevant.\n3. Option B: \"winners and may not win\" could be used to indicate competitiveness, but also could refer to performance as it relates to an event or activity. Because the context does not specify performance level or quality, this option is insufficient to be the one selected by John.\n4. Option C: \"winners and might win\" could be an indicator of competitiveness, but the possibility of winning is not exclusive to competitiveness. We would not associate competitiveness with a possibility of winning; rather, we would associate it with the drive to compete against others.\n5. Option D: \"losers and may not win\" is one of the options that is used to indicate John's competitiveness.\n6. This means that Option E: \"enemies\" is inappropriate, because John does not see other people as enemies; instead, they are simply competitors. John does not seek to defeat his competition through hostility, but rather by striving to outperform them on the playing field.\n7. The selection with the closest association with the context from Options C: Winners and may not win and D: Losers and may not win is C: Winners and might win. The answer is C: Winners to be a good competitor.\n\nAnswer: Choice C:\n\nWinners and might win\n\n### Input In a group of people, who was the tallest and who was the shortest?

Choice B, \"city\", does not correspond to any of the other choices given, so it is an invalid choice.\n3. Choices C and D, \"london\" and \"train station\" cannot be used as answers, because they are very specific descriptions of areas, which is not what the question asked.\n4.

Adult store is for people who are adults. Thus, no one is able to buy it. Thus, we can only choose between C and D\n\nA kid store sells mainly for children (like a toy store, for example), and adult store is for adult.

Choices: 1. \"purchase\"\n2. \"buy\"\n3. \"purchasing\"\n4. \"buying\"\n5. \"purchasable\"\n6. \"buyable\"\nRationales 1. the word \"purchase\" is not a synonym, it is a broader term than \"acquisition\". \"purchase\" can refer to any transaction, including when the product is already owned - while \"acquisition\" specifically refers to ownership or possession of something that was not already owned beforehand. Another difference between the two words has to do with their usage in sentences: while \"acquisition\" is more commonly used as a noun, \"purchase\" can also function as an adjective.\n2. \"buying\" is also not a synonym because it refers to the simple action of \"buying\", rather than the act of \"acquiring\".\n3. \"purchase\" can be used as a noun or an adjective, but it does not have the meaning of \"acquisition\" as a state of being owned.\n4. \"buyable\", on the other hand, is a word with the meaning of \"acquiring\", \"purchasing\".\n5. \"purchase\" is a synonym of \"acquisition\" because it has the same meaning - to acquire, to get through buying.\n\n### Output: What enables a majority of the people to take a trip?\n\nInput:\n\n### Demo:\n\n### Instructions: The lab results can be analysed to determine\n\n\nInput:\nInput:\nRationales:\nAnswer:\n\nI need to figure out how to contact a individual who shares a specific name.

{"text": "We can eliminate 3, 4, and 5 for the following reasons:\n1. They are all activities that would require removing one or more parts of the wood to use (removing the bark for polishing, planing off parts to be able to carve some sort of figure, or removing and burning the wood to start the process of composting). When the wood is burned, composted, or carved, the wood has been in someway removed. Unless the entire piece of wood is removed in one of these ways, one wouldn't be able to see one's reflection in it. Since 1 is being considered invalid, it is also invalid to think you would be able to see your reflections in a piece of wood being composted, or polished, or carved.\n2. When the wood is polished or composted, the roughest parts of the wood which are less reflective are often eliminated, but in the case of composted wood, the pieces that survive are not usable wood.\n3. When the wood is carved, one would typically be carving away pieces of the wood so one doesn't see one's reflection; therefore, seeing one's reflection is not the purpose of carving.\n4. The only remaining valid choice is \"when it is burned\", because when the wooden is reduced to a crisp, black shell, only the burned parts will be reflective.\n5. In this case, one may be able to see their reflection in burned wood, but they would have to be burning a piece of wood to such a degree that the wood would not be usable.

B: city - The choice refers to a specific location instead of a broad concept C: park - A park is a broad concept that could cover indoor and outdoor courts D: use - The concept \"use\" doesn't actually make any sense - The choice can be eliminated 3: los angeles - Los Angeles is not a location.

Choices:  Explanation: The suspects were accused of a murder and a theft.\nRationales: What we care about now is what makes them think they were tricked. One possible reason is that the police accused them of a murder which they didn't commit. Because we know that what they're talking about has to do with the murder, that makes B a strong contender.\nB: murder (A can be eliminated because it was not a murder)\nRationales: Another suspect of theirs was accused of murder (A), but they didn't commit it (B)\nThe second choice given to them was theft, which is still related because they didn't get accused of it in the first place. The police accused them of murder instead.\nF: theft\n\n### Answer: The suspects believed they had been tricked because they had been accused of a crime they didn't commit, and that's more likely a result of a trick rather than anything else.\nAnswer: F\n\n### Input \n\nThe police officer suspected someone of stealing something, and they wanted to know what they stole.

As we've established from the previous step, the performers would be on the platform performing. The options are A, B, D, and F.\n4.

Choices: A: stay in their yard B: play in neighbor's yard C : have a ball game D: have a picnic E: have a birthday party\n\n### Response :\n\n### Rationale :\n1. Start by understanding the question. We are told to consider some possibilities a friend might invite the child to do.\n\n2. Since we are asked for a possibility, it's important that the options all reflect possibilities rather than actualities (especially since the friend is asking, in which case, the child is unlikely to know what the friend wants to do with themselves).\n\n3. Let's start by discarding those that sound like actual invitations. We can eliminate E since \"a birthday party\" sounds like asking someone to attend a birthday party, not to be asked to hold one.\n4. If we were to hold a birthday party, a child might be invited to play various games, and it isn't implausible to think the friend might invite us over to invite us to play games. However, it's not specific enough about the games the child would play, as well as the friend (presumably, the invitation would go out from the friend directly to the child).

So it should not be included in the answer.\n3. Eliminate A: A boot is not a type of area on the foot. A boot is something to cover someone's feet, and so it is not the foot or area on the foot. So it is not an answer.\n4. Eliminate C, Loaf bread because bread is not a type of feet or a foot area.\n5. Now we can see that the answer is E: Hock because although dry and cracked heels aren't specifically on hocks, they can be on hocks; so it is a valid foot and area on the foot that dry and cracked heel can be found.\n\n6.

Choices:  - A: throw a ball to B: point to C: extend a hand D: push it to E: aim for him C)\n\n### Rationales:\n1. A throws a ball to another person: throws indicates moving an item quickly (e.g. a ball or any item at hand) towards the other person. Throws does not provide the concept of directing the item to another person, but rather throwing it.\n  -B \"point to\" another person: the act of pointing at an object is to draw your attention (of the other person) towards it using this finger gesture. Not to direct it to someone.\n2. E aim for him does not fit at all because one is not aiming to hit the other persons hands (it does not fit the question because aim for him refers to being able to draw an arrow straight into the other person's hand).\n3. D \"pushing it to him\" does not fit as the other person is the only one responsible to take or grab the item (it does not fit in the context because it makes the other person the only one (him) who is responsible for taking the item).\n4.

First, identify the choices one by one by breaking each word.\n2. 'front door' is a whole, so we skip.\n3. 'open' means something is found to be opened, so from this definition, there seems to be no reason to select  D: package, as it is closed.\n4. 'delivered' means something is delivered, which refers to someone handing something to people by a postal service, but that doesn\u2019t really explain why someone\u2019s mail might be opened. So, we can skip or eliminate A: a thief, stole, F: the thief, broke, G: an employee, took.\n5.'stolen' is a verb, 'to steal' is related to 'to steal'. The question is unclear. What is being stolen? The package? the contents or the entire package? But 'a thief stole' doesn't really answer our question.\n6. 'that had been' is an adjective, and a preposition too. We will ignore this in the process of grouping choices.\n7. 'delivered\" was already identified as an action of sending something. So, we leave out 'the letters that were delivered'.\n8.

'the letters that had been delivered' describes the letters that were sent, but these letters aren't stolen.\n10.

Rewrite it to make it more powerful.\n\n### Original:\nThe skyline of New York City in the 70\u2019s was unlike any city at that time. New York was a place where a lot of immigrants lived. That is why there were a lot of foreigners speaking in the streets and languages that were hard to understand. One evening after coming out of the subway station I walked down a street. It looked like it was abandoned. As I walked by a building I heard a language, I\u2019ve never heard before. At first I thought I was hearing a radio somewhere in the building but I didn\u2019t have my earbuds on. Then I realized the language was not from a radio but one of the tenants in that building. The tenant was speaking the language with a heavy accent. I realized that it was Italian. That day I was on my way home because as soon I walked by a building in that street I felt my stomach growling. I took out a dollar out of my pocket and I went to the neighborhood\u2019s local 7-11 and I bought a hot dog. I got home and I started eating my hot dog. Then the doorbell rang. I opened the door and there I found my favorite cartoon of all time in that time, Tom and Jerry. Right then I felt that my stomach grew bigger and bigger. Then I watched Tom and Jerry and fell asleep.\n\n### Rewrite:\nThe skyline in New York City in the \u201970\u2019s was different from other city\u2019s skylines. It was filled with many immigrants, which created an environment where new languages and dialects could be heard all day long.\nOne evening while walking down the street from the subway station in Little Italy, I couldn\u2019t believe what I heard. The foreign accent emanated through the building and echoed in every crack and corner. I had no earbuds on and no radio was playing in the nearby buildings. The language was clearly from a tenant. As I listened to what the tenant was saying, I realized that it was an Italian language, one of the many languages that were commonly spoken throughout Italy.\nMy stomach was beginning to make loud rumbles.

Choices: 1. A: computer screens 2. B: Internet 3. C: websites 4. D: the web 5. E: hyperlinks\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Starting with the correct answer, the term \"hyperlink\" refers to the ability to open another page by simply clicking on a link, rather than by pressing a separate button. As such, if a website allows users to connect to another page by clicking on a linked word or picture, this is an example of hypertext in action.\n2. An internet website is made up of a collection of hypertext links that allow users to access other pages or files (the \"web\") when specific words (\"hyperlinks\") are clicked or pressed.\n\n3. The terms \"computer screens\", \"the Internet\" and \"websites\" are incorrect because they are not specific enough to fit the context described in the question.\n\n4. Although \"websites\" might also be specific enough to reference hypertext links on a website without referring to the internet or computers specifically, it could also be referring to other types of sites such as blogs or social networks--which these are not.\n\n5. \"The web\" is not relevant because it does not describe a specific technological innovation in the context described by this question.\n\n6. \"", "answer": "D: front porch"}

The author must then make a decision to pick one of these locations.\n* 3.The four options have varying levels of specificity. A location within Ohio would be very general, whereas a large village in a specific location would describe an area at a smaller scale.\n* 4.The four options are not ranked in order of most likely location.\n* 5.The question asks for one of the four possible locations in the context of a good supply, so there are four possible correct options from four possible answer choices.\n* 6.Option E is \"countryside.\" A countryside would be in Ohio because most of Ohio is considered to be in the countryside and Ohio's countryside is known to be very sparsely populated with small towns. However, a more specific area is preferred over a generic one, so this is eliminated.\n* 7.The other three options have variations in specificity. Option B implies that a \"big city\" might refer to any type of city within the region. Although there's nothing wrong with that, in a more general context, choosing \"everywhere\" or any other option would be more likely. Option C, a suburb, is known to include many villages, and in any region, these villages might exist either within a \"suburb\" or not.\n* 8.Option A, rural area, is not likely when describing an area within a region where one particular good is sourced from.

We've gotten word that our nation's leader has been compromised and is under the influence of an evil foreign power. The problem has gotten so severe that the situation has been deemed a national emergency. Our nation faces a full-scale crisis and only you can save us. We've come to you now because we have obtained secret intel that the president's family is deeply involved in this plot. We've learned his spouse is working closely with top officials of this rogue nation and is secretly plotting against us all. The first lady is the key link between your traitorous leader and a foreign enemy. She must be stopped at all costs before it's too late. Here is our plea: if this traitor is caught, take him to the White House immediately. Only you can bring him to justice. We're counting on you to be our savior. Please, you must do this: bring the first lady to the White House. Remember, only you can save us now. Don't think, just act. Call the White House now and we'll make the necessary preparations. Don't delay, we rely on you for this life or death mission. The future of our nation hangs in the balance. We want you to be prepared. The White House has prepared a special place for this captured monster. She will be put to death immediately. We can't wait a moment, do this now: call immediately.

Let\u2019s follow the road; it\u2019s the only way we know anything about,\" is correct.\n\nThe first statement in the problem correctly references The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz, while the second statement alludes to how Scarecrows are created.\n\nSince the story does not provide any other specifics, and since the second statement references how Scarecrows were made during the story, it's logical that the Scarecrow would not have much in the way of internal organs; this has become known as \"the scarecrow principle\". In the context of the problem, it would make no difference whether the straw figure is made from wheat or oats.\n\nThe phrase \"Let's\" suggests the Scarecrow will not be a subject of the sentence, and thus a grammatical agreement should begin with the first person singular pronoun. Consequently, if the Scarecrow is referring to himself, the correct answer is \"yes;\" if he is referring to another subject, the correct answer is the plural form \"youse(r)\" or \"yourselves.\"\n\nSince the Scarecrow does not know the answer to the question which he is about to ask himself (i.e., which direction to go), he should be referring to someone else, who presumably knows.

Choices: 1: A: nanoseconds 2: B: milliseconds 3: C: minutes 4: D: seconds   E: F: Years\nRationales:\n1. When we are told an unknown value is to be compared with the given values, we must use the same type of value as the unknown. For example, if the question asks you to compare an unknown year with the years 2013, 2017, and 2005, the comparison is made with an unknown year.\n2. The given value is an unknown but it has been given to us in the form of a value for which we can determine its type.\n3. If the question had instead said compare 'the unknown year' with the given year, then we would not be comparing the value with a year. Instead all the given values (years) would be treated as units of time.\n4. Now let us look at the given values to determine their type. In this case, only A and B are years, as C, D, and E are not.\n5.  From this, we can deduce that years are the only types of values given in this question. As such, A and B will only represent years as well. If we include any other type, we will make an incorrect comparison.\n6.

{"text": "There are many potential reasons why a company may decide to be taken \"public.\" However, one major reason is to gain more funding. Companies go public so they can offer shares to investors, allowing them to raise capital from the public. Since the initial public offering is typically a \"hot\" market that offers a stock's first potential buyers, a company may be able to raise capital quickly. This increases the number of shares outstanding and decreases the price per share, enabling a company to provide shares at a lower premium to its early investors.

The theater and the bathroom are inappropriate; the theater could be the place of a single movie, not a place people tend to go to watch movies, and it is also a singular location. A conference is also a venue for showing movies (especially ones that are less popular than the ones showing at cinemas).

The choices include \nA house, a den, a family room, wood, and a floor. We can cross out \nA house and a den because they are not surfaces that bean bags can sit on. We can cross out wood and a family room because the \nchoice for a family room doesn't really make sense, and the options are vague enough that it's safe to presume \nall of the other options are off the floor.

The phrase'standing in line' may possibly indicate that one may 'be bored', however choice C does not directly link to such implications.

As my bank account balance increases, I pay more bills\n2. As I spend more money, my debt will increase\n3. I like spending money\n4. My checking balance increases\n5.

In the second sentence, income, a positive number, increases money (e.g. if we make more money, we can afford to pay more bills). In the third sentence, money, a positive number, is preferred over spending, which is negative, and is therefore opposite. In the fourth sentence, balance decreases when bills are paid--meanwhile, the opposite of income is spent, which is money and therefore positive. The final sentence is the inverse of the first--if we prefer using credit cards to using currency, and a credit card is a negative amount of money, then we don't want to pay for bills and bank/checking account increases.\n\nAll of the other options are mathematical sentences, but do not consist of only words that have different meanings (i.e. are not true mathematical sentences).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nIncome increasses as money increases\n\nAnswer: A\n\n### Input :\nWhich of the following items have a name starting with the letter A?

Choices:  a: yard b: basement c: kitchen d: living room e: garden\n\n## Answer:\nThe right answer according to the information of the options in the question is E: garden.\n\nInput: Which of these is true about plants? Choices: A. They can be damaged by direct sunlight B. They release oxygen C. They require a lot of water D. They convert carbon dioxide into oxygen E. They are used for shade\nRationales: It seems that you have been misled into believing that a plant is more a part of nature than a building. Well, here is an explanation that will clear that up right away: a plant is an organism that uses sunlight to produce food (energy) for all other life forms on Earth. A building is a structure made from bricks and wood, or some other material, for the purpose of sheltering people and animals.\nThe key to this answer is to understand that a building is not natural, and therefore not a part of nature. This fact makes it very difficult to decide between the answers A or E. However, the answer to this question is D.\nIf you remember that I said a plant is an organic, living thing that produces energy for all other life forms, then this makes perfect sense. A flower, like any other organism in nature, needs water to grow. It also needs sunlight to produce the food it needs to live. All plants, including flowers, require these two vital components that they can't otherwise provide for themselves.\nPlants, as I said before, are living organisms. They require sunlight and air to generate energy that then flows throughout the rest of the plant from its leaves to the flowers, or whatever their purpose is. Plants also release carbon dioxide, an important component of air, which humans and animals breathe back in again through their lungs. This helps to provide some balance in the atmosphere. So, plants provide oxygen to humans and animals and take back carbon dioxide, thereby maintaining a healthy environment.\nPlants are also important as food, which makes the answers B, C, D and E incorrect. However, answer \"A\"", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

Choices:  'punishing and uncompromising', 'austerely','strict in manner', 'hard-working', and'restrained', meaning 'austerely.'\nRationales: The word 'austerely' means 'punishing and rigorous,' which is an example of the 'austerely,''severe,' or'strict' in 'austere.' Austere is applied to both people and situations. A person can be said to be \"austere\" when he or she is not extravagant or showy. People, such as Mother Theresa, who are known for living a life of service are often referred to as 'austere.' When used in a context where speaking of people, the adjective 'austere' describes the individual as being strict in adhering to duty and service to others.

Choices: A: how many cars were involved B: when the accident happened C: the speed of the cars D: in one lane\nRationales: The question is asking about how to find out about a car accident involving a specific car that involved 'a number of cars.'\nThe car accident may have been a single car, but if cars were involved, it is important to know how many were involved.\nChoices A & B are inaccurate responses because we are looking for the number of cars involved in the car accident when this number is known.\n\nChoice D is not the correct answer because a car accident does not occur 'in one lane,' which is not a specific characteristic of a car accident.\n\nThe correct answer to what it is essential to find out is Choice C 'the speed of the cars.' Determining the speed of cars involved in a car accident would help to understand the incident more comprehensively.\nThe speed of the cars is likely to affect the dynamics of the car accident.\n\nChoices D would be relevant in determining some aspects of a car accident, but not all of them.\n\nAnswer: C: C: the speed of a car\n\n### Answer Format:\nAnswer by providing the correct option with relevant words to explain your choice.

{"text": "This is a very specific question, so it helps to break it down and understand the specific components first.\n1. The question is about where a lizard might surprise a person. There are many kinds of lizards, though, so we must be specific about what sort of lizard will be considered for this question.\n2. Choice A, New Mexico, is outside of the scope of this question because New Mexico is a state, even though it contains areas with forests, creeks, and gardens. Therefore, we can rule choice A out.\n3. Choosing a specific type of lizard, we can further rule out choices B and C based on location alone. Both forests and desserts are specific regions that only particular types of lizards may live in, so it would not be accurate to use these options.\n4. Garden makes the most sense as a location for lizard surprise, and since this is a hypothetical event, creeks and forests are viable options.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Since it is a hypothetical situation, we can determine the location of the surprise. Since this could happen anywhere, we can discard B, D, and E because they all contain non-lizard appropriate elements.\n2. Choices C and E include non-lizard suitable areas.

{"text": "Answer: E: refrigerators\n\nInput: To find the square root of a number, what kind of operation is required? Choices: \nA: multiplication B: division C: subtraction D: addition E: multiplication\nRationales: The question is asking about what type of operation needs to be done when finding the square root of a given number. The square root of a number is the value that when multiplied by itself yields the quantity.\n\nThe options include multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition. These operations can be used to evaluate the square root of a certain number, but not all four types are required. Multiplication and division are generally the only operations used when finding the square root. Therefore, we can eliminate the other types of operations as potential answers to this question.\n\nAs we evaluate the options still available, we notice that option C, subtraction, is unlikely since we are looking for an operation to find the square root and not an operation that would take us in the opposite direction. This eliminates subtraction from consideration.\n\nLikewise, we can eliminate addition, as it's not a common operation that is used to determine the square root of a value.\n\nTherefore, the only options that remain are multiplication and division. We eliminate multiplication since division is necessary when finding the square root and addition, subtraction, or division are the only operations that are required.\n\nHence, division would be the correct answer since division is necessary when it comes to finding the square root of any number.

The question is designed to ask an individual to identify something they are trying to achieve through grooming before a job.\n2. The first option, 'looking good' is a subjective opinion. 'Beauty' is a subjective term, so we can discard this as well. 'Tardiness' is certainly a negative thing to have if you are going for a job, so we can discount this as well. 'Handsomeness' is an outdated term, so this must go as well.\n3. We are left with 'neatness', which is a clear objective from the question. \n4. Since 'neat' portrays the individual trying to be well-groomed and 'ness' denotes a state of being, 'neatness' will suffice as the correct choice.\n5. The answer to this question, then, is E: neatness.\n\nAnswer: D:\n\n### Instructions:\nIn this problem, write two sentence summaries for each text passage.

A plays an important role in trick taking games.\n4. A plays an important rule in trick taking games because it's in the most central location, making it the best choice for getting rid of certain cards that you have in your hand.\n5.

{"text": "The response that appropriately complements this scenario is B: pleasure.\n\n#### Rationales:\n1. A wife asks her husband to stop being married because she no longer wants to be married to him. This can cause the husband to have various emotions towards his wife, like happiness or pleasure, displeasure, or grief, depending on the situation.\n2. Based on the current scenario, we can eliminate choices A and C, happiness and grief, respectively, because these options don't fit well with the other options. If the husband's wife has asked him to stop being married because of the unhappy condition of their marriage, it's unlikely that the husband would feel happy (choice A) or experience grief (choice C) toward her.\n3. Choices B and D, pleasue and isolation are less obvious. These are not mutually exclusive options, which means the husband can feel either one or both depending on specific circumstances outside of the question. However, since the question only asks about the husband's feelings with the wife, we can rule them out.\n4. Therefore, choice B, pleasure, is the most suitable response that correctly complements the question.\nAnswer: B: pleasure\n\n### Input:[A scientist in a study was researching the effects of a new vaccine to combat a recent outbreak of disease.

Responses C and D are also unlikely since there are many people in either places.\n\nThis leaves us with just one correct answer: \"the surface of the Earth.\"", "answer": "B: house"}
{"text": "You would find a sign with some waiting people either next to the roadblock which is described as a \"city\" or at a bus stop which is the only place that has an \"E\", street corner only has \"B\", and roadblock only has \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\" in them. Thus, the answer to the question would be E: City because that's where a sign with people next to it can be found.\n### Rational\nYou have to go by the definition of a sign. It is an object which usually directs or marking a place so a person would be next to the marked place if the sign is at the bus stop. You also need to consider both options \"street corner\" and \"city\" as there is only an \"E\" in the \"city\" so that means those two options are not valid by the choice options that is provided. Since \"street corner\" is not valid if there are no people by the sign because they are lined up next to a roadblock you need to get the answer at a roadblock only place that is called \"City\".\n\nAnswer: C: roadblock\n\n### Question:\nWhat is likely to happen to one's speech if his or her thinking skills are impaired?\n\n### Input :\nChoices:  A: clarity B: inebriation C: drunk driving\nRationales:\n\n### Input\nWhat is considered a common cause of death in America?\n\n### Instructions:Answer the question with an appropriately chosen item.\n\n### Input choices:\n\n1.

{"text": "### Demostation:\nInput: One of the members of the family lost money on the cards, what did the others feel? Choices:  O: Anger A: Joy B: Sadness C: Loss D: Money\nRationales: Options A and B: Joy and Sadness respectively, make the player happy and sad. As the loser was one of the players, the other players might also lose money that was bet by them. This indicates that they might be feeling happy or sad after the game based on the outcome of the bets. The winner of the game would be feeling Happy. That makes the total four choices: Angry, Angry-Happy, Sad, Angry-Sad. Option C: Loss makes the winner of the game Happy and the person losing money Sad. Option D: Money makes the loser feel sad and the winner Happy. It could be argued that because the winner made the loser happy, they felt joy. But Joy can only make the loser feel happy.

First, \"buying _these_\" and \"they will be...\" alludes to a single group of objects that will be bought. \"These\" implies a large group of similar, related things that have something in common, such as a shared quality, feature, or characteristic.

There are 4 triangles in the picture, all of which are isosceles\n- B. All triangles are congruent\n- C. All triangles in the diagram are isosceles.\n- D. All angles in the diagram are equal.\n\nOption A cannot be the correct statement because it asserts too many aspects of the diagram while the specifics are not explicitly described in the explanation given in the question. Option B is also incorrect, since it does not sufficiently explain the nature of the triangles in comparison to the statement.

Choices C, 'feet' and D, 'blisters' are plausible choices, but both can refer solely to the feet. Therefore, neither choice explains the physical sensation that is in direct response to the act.\n5. Choice E, 'locomotion.' refers to the ability to move around. In this case, the person was walking, but this describes movement without a specific context or reference.\n6.

{"text": "In the context of this scenario, the options are describing situations in which one can witness an event even from a distance. The question is asking for something that one can do without being near to the event itself.\n\n### This answer is given by following reasons:\n1. Go somewhere or see exhibits can be considered as a choice with the potential to contain some sort of event, albeit it may not be one specifically designated for observation. This choice could be considered, but is not applicable to this scenario since any kind of event that one would see in such a setting would not necessarily involve leaving the house.\n2. The choice outdoor concert would be incorrect because in attending outdoor concerts, the listener is almost certainly in attendance.\n3. Choices hear testimony, surf net, and see exhibits could be considered as options for something that one can actually do outside their homes, however they are not directly related to attending an event, and any other option that would be applicable would be similar to that of attending a concert.\n4. When considering D, outdoor concert, the answer is obvious that in attending an outdoor concert, it would not be possible to attend a concert from a distance since the one thing preventing people from leaving their homes is curiosity about a concert that they can only watch from a distance.\n5.

Choices:  Dr. David, Miss Martha and Ms. Linda \n\nRationales: Firstly, as a general guideline, we should always make sure that our response is either/or. That would help in creating the context for the question. Here, we should be selecting which one person is more likely to talk to, so we don't need to answer all three.\nSecondly, the question states there are three people, which means that there are three possible options. When answering any question, we would need to know which options we are answering against.\nThirdly, the answer options are Dr. David, Miss Linda and Ms. Martha. Since Miss Linda and M s. Martha are already mentioned twice in the previous sentence, they are the candidates for comparison.\nFinally, it's important to read the instruction carefully before even beginning to answer.

The options include: a hike, a ski, a walk, a horseback ride, and a bicycle ride.\n\n3. The response \"all of the activities\" is not a valid option because there is no indication that all of those activities listed are necessary for the question.\n\n4. The activity \"a horseback ride\" is not suitable for someone who is not interested in either hiking or skiiing because it combines elements of the two and may not be well-suited to someone without such interests.\n\n5.

As stated in 'question' above, one of the 4 elements of Earth are most abundant among.\n2. Choices A to E are those respective elements.\n3. Elements' availability in Earth doesn't change over time. So, for this question, it only matters to compare the elements' presence among the Earth to determine the more abundant element. This will result in a direct comparison between all possible answers from A to E.\n4. Among all choices, the answer that is in most abundant amount in Earth must be chosen.\n5. So, we can eliminate choices D and E, copper and tin, as they are in a less relative amount to the question, bronze and gold.\n6. Among the remaining choices, it is obvious that the most abundant element is Gold, as it is much more widely found in Earth compared the other two silver and bronze. Silver and bronze are also relatively difficult to be found in Earth in considerable amount.\n7. As such, the more abundant element in Earth is Gold, with the answer choice E, Gold.\nAnswer:E: Gold\n\nInput: The test is divided into three sections, but the students only knew how to do sections A, B or C, but not both.

Choices A: the student B: the author C: the speaker D: the speaker's mother E: the speaker's sister\nRationales: A. The student is a human being with a name. The author is someone who wrote something. The speaker is someone who is talking about/to someone. The speaker's mother and sister are both humans with names.\n\n### Explanation: The student was a person who attended the class. The instructor knew this person's name, but could not think of it. It is possible that the instructor knew the student's mother's and sister's name. Since the student's mother and sister (whomever they may have been) are not mentioned by the instructor as names who would be memorable, it would not be feasible to assume that the instructor had attended to their particular names in particular. Thus, the person referred to is very likely the student who was in the class. C is also incorrect as the speaker would have mentioned the name of the author instead of making vague references to an author in general. For the same reason that it could not be an author, it could not be a speaker as the author would have also provided their name if they had been a speaker. D is incorrect since the speaker would have mentioned their mother's or sister's name instead of making general reference to a mother or sister. A possible exception as a possible name that could be provided would be the speaker's daughter, although the speaker usually would not refer to their daughter by name in the context of a class.

Start by taking into consideration that \"villa\" is definitely not the appropriate option because if it was the question would be \"did they upgrade to a villa?\"\n2. The second option that is out of contention is \"spacecraft\".\n3. It seems farfetched that a small cabin could be upgrated to a \"hall\", \"palace\" or \"hotel\", all of which are very much more grand in nature.\n3. This leaves us with two options: \"villa\" and \"spacecraft\". None of the other options makes any sense.\n4.

Therefore, the reader is left with the correct answer choice being \"spacecraft\" or \"villa\".\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is \"spacecraft\". While it is indeed unlikely that the question asks \"did they upgrade to villa,\" this is also clearly the most logical option when considering that all the other options are too vastly disparate to be accurate.

I sat down to watch a movie and as soon as I was hooked on the plot and the characters, I decided to start getting ready for bed. While I was getting ready I noticed a small, 2-inch tall creature in my living room. It had brown hair and brown eyes and a round head. So, I said \u201cWho is that?\u201d My dog came and stood beside me. I was so disturbed by how small the creature was that I said \u201cI wonder what he\u2019s doing here?\u201d so, my dog told me to bring him to the kitchen to find out.\nI took the creature carefully by gently picking him up with a piece of paper. The next thing I did was to hold him near a window so as to let some light pass through, to find out, he was a man! I took him to the kitchen and I told him that the next question was if I had a good place to sleep at night. I had a very good bedroom with a bed and nice clothes and the TV etc. He said that he wished he could. As soon as I had him there I closed the door and put him to sleep in my bed.

We know that we are working with expressions with subtraction.\n2. If 2 - 3 is, in fact, equal to 6 - 5, then this should clearly be the most correct option.\n3. The others would clearly be wrong, since an operation like subtraction can't be used on expressions with the other forms.\n4. This leaves the choices: A, B and D.\n5. An expression with '*' is a multifactor and can be used in subtraction.\n6. An expression with '^' is a power (e.g 3^3).\n7. Option D does contain 5 to 5, but we are not looking for a power expression, since 6 - 5 is not equal to the chosen expression. Option D is clearly incorrect.\n\n8. Option B is clearly incorrect because the expression can't be used with subtraction. It is an expression with '*'.\n\n9. It is now between A and C. One of these needs to be used in an expression with subtraction, and one cannot be. We are not given a choice for the expression, so we can assume that any form is correct for this.\n\n10.

When the data structure are large, the algorithm is simple. When the scale decreases the algorithm is complex.\n2. A list is a ordered array.\n3. Two operations of list are + and -. + means add a element to the end of list. - means remove first element of the list. The result list is the same as the original one.\n4. The operation of list can be performed by a loop using a pointer which is \n    - `start`, and\n    - `end`\n\n5. The length of list is called `count`.\n\n6. The first element of a list is located by the pointer `start`.\n\n7. To insert a element to the head of list, we need to first copy the element we want to at the `start` location, then move the pointer `start` by one place. Then, we move `end` by one place. Since before inserting the new element the element after the `end` pointer were already considered, we have to insert the head of the new list before moving `end` pointer by one before making it point to the new element. In short, you need to insert a list before the old list, and the new list is the one you are putting in front.\n\n8. To remove the first element of a list,\n    - initialize the pointer `start` to the start of the list.\n    - initialize the `end` pointer to the same location as the last element (before the last element).\n    - Move the pointer `start` and `end` by one step (the next element to the first element).\n    - Print that element.\n9.

You are asking the task \"how to \nto\" \"thank someone\". The next step in problem \nsolving is to ask, \"Why would I want to \"? \n\"Do I have to do something in \nparticular?\" \"Should I do anything?\" \nYou would want to \"say\" you were \"thankful.\" \nThe third step is to ask, \"How to do it?\" \nAs mentioned before, the task is to \"Do I have to \ndo it in a particular way?\" A person \"shake hands\" \nas a \"way to say thanks\" or \"excuse yourself for \ngood manners\". A person can \"hold a hand\" as a \"way\", \nas a \"thank you\" is a specific gesture indicating \nthe words are not spoken. A person \"feel good\" \nabout the thank for words and actions. Finally, \nyou ask, \"Do I have to \"? Well, \"a thank you\" doesn't have \nto be a \"good answer\". A person can \"apologize\" for \nthe words and actions. The fourth step is to ask, \n\"If a task needs to be \"in a particular way\" \nor needs to be done at a specific time, then ask \n\"When to do it?\" or \"where to do it?\". In this \ncase, a person \"express gratitude for a task\" \nat any time. When the task asks, \"when to do it?\"  the \nanswer is \"When to do it?\". \"When to do it?\" is \n\"How to do it?\" in context, as discussed previously. \nA person \"thank anyone\" for anything.

Rewrite the sentences, using a variety of formats.\n\nThe purpose of this experiment was to determine whether two different types of light bulbs burned out (exhibit a) equally quickly when both bulbs were shining at the same intensity. Two bulbs were selected: a common yellow bulb rated 100 W and a specialized blue bulb rated 40 W, the latter being 70 W less than the former. Both bulbs were hung in similar fixtures and were left on all the time, day and night, for 300 hours. Both types of bulbs were working perfectly at the end of the period.\n\n \n###### The experimenter was unable to determine whether the two bulbs burned out at the same rate, but instead believed that they continued to shine at a more steady rate for the duration of the experiment.\n \n\n###### The next paragraph states that the experimenter is uncertain about the rate of burning out because they cannot measure the rate. The rate of burning out is defined as how fast the bulbs burn out, which is not visible to see.\n\nIn the actual experiment, the first blue bulb burned out when the total of both bulbs had been on for 90 hours.\n \n###### In the experiment, the actual data for the burning out of the bulbs in 90 hours is a number. The experimenters can write down this value for the burning out of a blue bulb.\n\nAt this time, the yellow bulb was still burning. Three hours later, the yellow bulb burned out, as well. By this time, only 90% of the 270 hours was used.\n \n##### The experimenters can write the actual numbers down for the yellow and blue bulbs, including when they burned out. This can be done as shown below.\n \n#### ## Bulb 1: burns out at", "answer": "C: large city"}

The question is looking for two reasons why people do NOT attend the same place every single week.\n2. Starting with choice B, because it has different music, indicates that people do not attend the SAME place every single week. The question is trying to find reasons why people do not do so.\n3.

Choices: College courses A: no grades B: summer school C: extra curriculars D: a job E: time off\nRationales: The question is asking what percentage of college students return to the school with something after being away for the summer. 1. Option C, ''extracurricular activities,'' is ruled out because this can mean different things for different people; extracurricular activities may or may not be a thing that students do during the summer or while their away from school.\n2. Option E, ''time off,'' is also no good because it could mean anything, and is not specific for college students when they're away from school.\n3. So, by elimination, the remaining choices include grades, summer school, and a job. 4. Option A, ''grades,'' describes something that happens after you graduate, which the word ''summer school'' hints at. So, the grades must be something that occurs during school.\n5. Option B, ''summer school'' is eliminated because it specifically refers to the summer break and not the school year. 6. Option D, ''a job,'' means something that you could do any time, not just during the summer.\n7. Therefore: The answer is D, the job.

That\u2019s really how I define a scientist. It\u2019s someone who has some familiarity with the scientific method. But, practicing scientists, I mean, anybody could call themselves a scientist. But, the person who calls themselves a scientist because they had a chemistry class in grade school, but they\u2019ve never thought critically about it, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very accurate description. I mean, practicing scientists work and conduct all sorts of different kinds of experiments.\n\n[Transcript Name]: When is an individual considered a competent scientific practitioner?\n\n[Dr Pritchett]  I think that\u2019s probably when they understand the scientific method well enough to be able to conduct a meaningful experiment, when they are really familiar with the different ways that scientists report and describe things.

While the first two definitions can be said to mean \"facts\" or \"information\" they don't necessarily mean \"facts\" obtained from books or teachers or information that's been investigated.

{"text": "### Rationale:\nAs a response to the question, write a sentence that appropriately completes it.\n\n### Explanation\nTo answer this question, first consider the question in relation to all possible clues it's offering and make note of all the information you may be able to deduce based on what you're reading. This is a type of question that often asks what particular city is mentioned in the text, so look for any clues that would help you to arrive at an accurate answer.\n\nThe key elements of this question are, \"This city in Northern Norway,\" \"things to do like Polar nights half marathons, located in the middle of Northern lights oval.\" These facts reveal that this city is in Northern Norway and has a lot of \"things to do\" for residents and tourists alike.\n\nFrom these clues, you can deduce that this is a tourist town. This would explain the multiple activities and events that are associated with it.\n\nThis clue also reveals something about the location of the town, which is important. You can see that it is in the middle of the region (the \"circle\" with \"oval\" in it). Looking at a map of Northern Norway, it's easy to see that Troms\u00f6 is near the middle of the region.\n\nLastly, it's useful that the text specifies this city is in \"Northern Norway\". In other parts of Norway, \"North\" may mean different locations that have little in common with each other, so without this information, you may be easily confused between cities in the south or in the northeast that are named like \"North Oslo\". Troms\u00f6 is certainly not this city.\n\nAnswer: To the question, I would write:\n\n\"The city in Northern Norway is Troms\u00f6 and this city is near the middle of Norway\u2019s Northern Lights Oval.\"\n\n### Input What is a difference between what he said and what they were doing in one of the places where they lived?

Become the Prey of some larger animal (True)\n\n> This is the most likely scenario since squirrels are usually predator for other animals, especially for birds. Although Squirrel's are preyed upon by hawks, owls, large snakes, and other wild animals, they are more likely to hunt down small mammals, invertebrates, berries, and nuts as a primary food source \n\n#### C (True):\n\nSince cute female squirrells would be preyed upon by bigger and larger animals such as hawks, we can quickly discard this choice.\n\n#### D (False):\n\nSince squirrel can attract another female squirrel by showing the food, we can discard this choice. \n\n#### E (True):\n\nThe most likely scenario is that a squirrel will become food for a raccoon. Since the answer is not given to us with the full context, we can guess the answer based on other options given in our question.\n\nThis can also be explained with 2 scenarios:\n\nWhen a female squirrel meets a male squirrel, it would show", "answer": "D: egg carton"}
{"text": "Input: Toothpaste goes bad, when? Choices: 1. Toothpaste becomes hard. A: After the cap is removed. 2. Toothpaste becomes wet. B: After the cap is opened. 3. Toothpaste becomes runny. C: After the bottle is empty. D: After 6 months, it has been opened.\n Rationales: It might seem like you need to use 'A' and 'B' to give a complete response because after the 'cap' is removed, the toothpaste becomes hard. But when it comes to multiple choice questions, you always have to take the information given in the question when coming up with an answer. In this case, 'A' and 'D' are the options, which fit well with the question. 'A' is hard as it refers to a cap and it could apply to the question. Similarly, 'D' is runny and it could work in the question. But we cannot use 'D' and 'A' to create our answer because they will create a problem in the sentence. We cannot say that 'After the bottle is empty toothpaste becomes hard'! You have enough pieces to create an answer: (A) and (B), without using (C) and (D). (D) means hard or dry which does not match with 'After the bottle becomes empty.'\n Answer: After the cap is open the toothpaste becomes runny and After the bottle becomes empty the toothpaste become hard.\nInput: Sally is a college student majoring in the study of languages, she is a native English speaker and a teacher in a high school with a college degree, she was teaching French to high school students for the first time, what language did the students speak?

{"text": "1. We begin with the question: \"What could happen to you....?\"\n2.

These two choices can both be answered in three ways:\n**You could see beautiful clouds**: You could see some beautiful clouds after you see some beautiful cloud.\n**Something could happen to you**: Something could happen to you if you see some beautiful clouds.\n**You could see all types of beautiful clouds**: You can see all types of beautiful cloud after you see some beautiful and some dull.\n\n### Answer: A: rainbow\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Input: A friend of yours is traveling across the globe for the first time.

The options A-E are all cities that the friend could be traveling to.\n3. Although some of these cities could be visited more than once, this question specifically asks about visiting for the first time, so we can narrow down the choice to only those that have never been visited before.\n4.

{"text": "D: stadium\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: A group had come into the library to do what? Choices: A: study B: sit C: relax D: hang out E: talk \nRationales:1. The question asks for the answer choice that best fits the meaning of the underlined word.\n2. We should not consider a group that comes to study or do other things in a library to do 'hang out.' 'Hanging out' is not a synonym for 'coming into the library.' It is a different type of activity.\n3. In this case, a group coming to the library to do whatever they want is more relevant to the answer choice'relax.' \n4. A similar case is the answer choice'relax' because it could fit either relaxing or doing what we want. In this context there are two things, study and 'hanging out,' that are not relevant to relax. \n5. But'religion' is not exactly relevant to what is written in the question to do in the library because the meaning of that it not about coming to library to do'religion,' but to come into library to do what 'you want.'\n6. Similarly 'fitness center' can also be selected but there are few relevant words are like 'jogging' and 'exercise' which are related to 'fitness center'\n7.

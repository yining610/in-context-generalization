A magazine store is not the correct answer because a tailor shop only sells fabric but magazines deal with content.\n\n### Input1: Where can you find a person when they go to a book store? Choices: A: librarian B: reader C: writer D: shopkeeper\n\n### Response1:\nThe best answer to the question can be found at A) the bookstore and not at B) the reader.\n\nIn response to your response, there must be more information.\nIn response to the response:\n\nThe response says the reader is found in the bookstore but the answer to the question asked is: where can you see a person when they go into a bookstore?\n\nFurthermore, what would you expect your response to be?  Please clarify your response by saying, \"In response to your response\"... etc. or include a code on the end of the sentence.\n\n\n### Output: You would expect to see a librarian when you find people go to a bookstore if that had been the question you were working on.\n\n### Further Output: Please respond as the answer is incorrect.\n\n### Clarifying Information:\nThis is correct.\n\nPlease continue.\n\n### Note: Further details about how to solve this question that is not clear has appeared in your answers, and has been flagged in the questions.\n\n### Solution: \nYour solution needs to be explained more in detail than the words you have used. The problem appears to be with \"you would expect to see a LIBRARIAN when you find people go into a book store\" the solution must be changed to \"You would not expect to see a Librarian in the Book Store as they do not attend the book store\".", "answer": "A: contagious"}

The \"were\" indicates he was wrong and what was wrong is not given. So far we don't know what the things that are wrong are, so we assume that the cards are wrong for something to be wrong because \"common and worthless\" means there's a difference between common and worthful that's wrong and to be rectified, therefore the correct answer was \"wrong\" (Choice E or F) which had both \"wrong\" and \"rectified\" in it, but I chose the one that had the word \"rectified\" in in order to explain why the other answer was wrong:\n```\n\n```:Choices C and E had \"wrong\" but neither had \"rectified,\" only E had \"wrong and worthless and rectified\" and C had \"wrong or rare or both wrong and worthless,\" so one of them had to be the answer and it had be one of them. I'm going to explain it, because people aren't likely to just understand your explanation without any explanation at all. I have notified the author so he/she will understand why someone decided to downvote his/her answer. In all fairness, he/she's written some other nice explanations, I just don't know why this person went out the way and downvoted the explanation before the downvote was undone``.\n\n\n```\nTo explain the upvote, I'll say that the author seems to get upset when people give hints, because he/she said that giving hints \"doesn't count\" as an answer. I don't understand why, because when I'm reading the instructions and looking at the choices, I don't understand many of them, so I ask a question that only asks about what is the correct meaning, and some people get upset and say that my question doesn't count", "answer": "D: rare"}

{"text": "Input:\nA person notices pop corn, cotton candy at playground, where is he likely to have been there?\n\n### Response Explanation:\nThe person was at the playground or he might have been there.\n\n\n### Example Response (Good)\nTo start, there appears to be a mismatch in the capitalization of the words in your instructions, and it appears that you were likely trying to ask \"Where would someone be if they were reading magazines?\" You have two possible answers: at the train station if they are waiting for a train, or in the book store if they are waiting for or looking for a book.\n\nInput: Fabric in cut to order at what seller?\n\nI believe you were trying to ask \"What seller is fabric cut to order at?\" There are two answers to this question: a fabric curtain shop is probably the one cutting it. The other, and most likely, choice would be a tailor shop because they cut fabric to fit a purpose so that you can sew them later or buy them for fashion.\n\nInput: Where would one be if they are reading magazines?\n\nI feel like you want to know where someone would be if they were reading a magazine. There are 4 possible places: at a doctor's office, a bookstore, a train station, or the countryside. I would narrow it down to a bookstore because it isn't a common place to be reading a magazine, and you're probably not going to be reading a magazine while doctors are examining you. If you could narrow it down anymore, I would say the countryside because books require less fuel than magazines do, and a book will last longer than one magazine. If that was too difficult, though, then the train station is likely.\n\nInput: A person notices popcron and cotton candy on grass.\n\nThis one is a bit harder. It sounds like you're asking: \"If they're on a playground, what were they doing there?\" but I think that you wanted to ask: \"Where are they if they notice popcron and cotten candy on a playground?\" There are 4 places to be: on the playground, in a soccer game, in a fairground, or in the countryside, if we're not taking \"playground", "answer": "B: fairgrounds"}

The choices are ground, human body, repair shop, combustion engines, and service station. The user can only choose one answer that will be used.\n- Oil is applied to machinery to reduce friction. Machinery needs to be lubricated regularly because they do wear out over time. This is to reduce friction when part of machinery moves near to part of machinery or part of machinery to another part of machinery. This is to reduce the wear and tear of moving part of machinery relative to moving part of machinry.\n- Machinery may use different oils depending on what needs to be lubricaded. Machinery may use oils that can be burnt, but these aren't used for oil to be used. The oil that would be used is the oil that can be found in car engines, and diesel engines are different form of engines. \n- The oil used in car engines and diesel engines lubricates and cools parts of machinery that do move, as well as doing its job if needed to be burnt. \n- Car engines and diesel engines have different needs for oil. A service station with diesel and car are in different places on the earth from where the human is. Only one would contain the type of oil needed.\n- This means it could be a ground, a repair shop, a combustion engine, a service station, or a human body where the oil would be needed to be used. Each of these choices represents a different type of oil. One is the fuel from the station, and one is a part of machinery that applies this oil.\n- Other than ground and repair shop, neither one use this type of oil.

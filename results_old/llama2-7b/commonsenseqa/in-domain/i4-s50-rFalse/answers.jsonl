{"text": "The correct answers are\n\n### A: B: C: D:\n### A: The input question asks about 'getting a divorce' when speaking to a lawyer. You can't use 'being married' to describe yourself when you're speaking to someone about getting a divorce. (You'd have to use a different verb that's not conjugated.) A lawyer can't help you if you are not divorced, and thus, divorce is still true.\n \n### B: The input question asks what relationship status you are trying to end when speaking to a lawyer about ending your relationship. You can't end a relationship with another lawyer. A lawyer and another lawyer might want to have a relationship, but there are no more legal rights associated with ending a legal relationship.\n \n## What is the best practice for learning a complex task?\n\nLearning a complex task is an act that involves the creation of novel combinations of knowledge. There is no best practice for learning this kind of task.  \n\nWhat is the best practice for completing an arduous task?\n\nCompleting arduous tasks involves a series of actions. To complete an arduous task, first plan your approach. Then move towards completion of the task. This strategy is called _iteration_. _Iteration_ is like the process of _trial and error_.\n\nWhat is the strategy employed by a machine learning algorithm?\n\n _Iteration_ is a strategy that can be implemented by a learning machine. But how does a machine learn? Machine learning algorithms are often the key components of data processing problems and are often used to build and train prediction models.\n \n## Explain why you believe the best practice is always to begin with the end in mind.\n\nThe best practice for beginning anything is to focus on the end result. By completing a project with a specific end goal in mind, we can see all of the things that have to be done to reach that end.  \n\n## Explain why failure provides lessons for improvement.\n\nFailure provides more information about improvement than success. Failures contain information about the problems that led to failure. They also describe the solutions that could be used to solve the problems.  \n\n## Describe why a person who is always learning is capable of building a more complex cognitive system than a person that has not learned anything.\n\nA person who is always", "answer": "A: being married"}

The word before the verb is the name of the category and determines the choices for that category. Each of those are then in order (1-5). Each of those letters are blank spaces.\n\nOnce you have found what answer to put in a blank space, the next blank space to find will have either a number (one, two or three) or nothing. The number indicates how many different answer choices are available in that category. In the example problem, there would be four choices - C, D, E and F. However, since the category is \"park,\" there are only two choices - B and C.\n\nOne example of the next blank space could be a number greater than one.

If I go to the restaurant, I can eat whatever I want. If I have 3 hours to spare, I can go to the grocery store. If I have 0 hours to spare, I will have to get in the car. If I don't get my butt kicked, I will have to buy more food.\n\n### Conclusion:\nA menu is a menu. I cannot choose what is on a menu. A person is the only who decides what to choose from the menu. If you get too many people making too many decisions over time, you will end up making decisions for yourself that may make things a little difficult for you\n\n---\n\n### Credit:\nThis solution created by [John-Luc Vandalon](https://github.com/jlucv) on [g", "answer": "B: office"}

Sometimes my aunt and uncle visit us,  even though my aunt and uncle are more like half brothers and half sisters to my father.  But my father treats them as if that is not the case.  As soon as they enter the house my father jumps to his feet and starts shouting,  \"what are you two doing here!\" At this point we all laugh  just like when my mother was home.\n\n### Request:  Write a response that is one or more sentences in length, that does not use any of the text in asterisks*.\n\n### Detailed Request:\n\nYou could use only text from this narrative to complete the task.\nInstead, use text from the narrative and external sources, along with your own original thoughts to construct a cohesive written response.\n\nYou must write at least one response in which you answer the question \"What is the only thing thatcan be broken?  \"The only thing we know how to break is the law.\" I did not write it, but I think it is correct.

{"text": "C: He would avoid being in the park.  Some places do not allow animals.  The pet shop allows pet sales and this could result in animal abuse. Also, pet stores that sell animals that are supposed to be pets are not as safe as just letting dogs take care of themselves.  Pet stores, like all animal warehouses, are stressful.  Not only this but having animals on your person is stressful.  When your going to an unfamiliar place, you might not find where you are or you may not have the knowledge of finding your way back.  On top of that, animal smell is also very unpleasant.  It is the same as an old schoolyard, but there is no smell in school.  The park is a place for wild animals so the animals may want to go there too.  It is in a wilderness, which is not meant to have humans present.  It is also important to note that the dog park is only for dogs.  Dogs are not supposed to interconnect with humans.  Last but not least, dogs may be in danger at the dog park.\n\n### Input Where is it safe to play music? Choices: A: grocery store B: restaurant C: airplane D: living room E: park\n\nIn order to play a musical instrument, you need a private place and the best place to practice would be in your house.  Playing in public places can be a distraction to people in the neighborhood.  There is also a risk of hurting someone by playing loudly in their home and disrupting them from their daily routine.  The most obvious noise that comes from an instrument is your own voice while singing which is annoying.  Lastly, the most important reason is privacy.  You do not want people to see the instrument you are practicing with.  It might be embarrassing and hurt your self esteem.", "answer": "A: pet store"}

You can find other stores in these places as well, but they are not the main focus.

If you go to a store, like Ikea for example, and set up an appointment, you could have someone walk you through and show you new sofas and help you choose one.

The student can answer some questions correct and some incorrect, but they are always getting closer. The student's response is a little more helpful on open-ended questions.\n\n### How to help:\n\nI need some suggestions on how I can improve.\n\n* I'm a little rusty, but I just try to answer questions, maybe get more practice.\n\n* Feedback from mentor is good but not very specific.\n\n* I would like to hear about the specific areas that I should be improving in but I guess I just got to do it myself", "answer": "C: city"}

{"text": "* You need to specify what kind of construction. Like if it was a road, then yes you have to call the site or excavation a construction site. But like if it was landscaping or building of a house I would guess that would not be a construction site since it is not a road of a street. It is a bridge between a structure that needs to built and the foundation of the building. But maybe the foundation of the building is just a simple pole holding it together.\n\n* It is up to the person to pick where the archeological dig is on the list of places they are asking about. If they chose one of the places you would recommend they did not pick that place, then they should not dig there. It is up to the site manager to approve or disapprove of the idea of digging in this place.\n\nResponse:\n* What a terrible idea to ask a question like this. It could be that the archeological site is right where the construction site is located. It just does not mean they will need to excavate the archeological site.

From the question, I can\u2019t figure that country is which one out of choices because I found the first two questions that I asked are about USA and I want to answer questions quickly so I choose country that I know most of American history and that is \u201cUnited States\u201d.\nThe first question is about the park and  I think park is the correct answer because humans usually when they want to escape from city they go to the park, but the park is not the only choice they can go there because this world is different and it\u2019s changing. For example city is growing day after day and city is different than village which the village is less crowded than city. So, there is no sure that humans go to park because of humans the park is also in village and the question can be that question can be changed. So, they can change the question to \u201cWhere do humans go in villages to be in nature?\u201d and the answer can be different than park, because humans go to park when they go to a city.\nSecond question is about the foot ball and the first answer is yes, because the game is related to the football game where the ball is thrown in the goal and if it hits to the penalty box that person goes to the goal and the second answer is no, because they didn\u2019t say what the game is they only said the foot ball. My other answer is yes in the sense the game is related to football but not the true the game is different from the soccer game.\nThe third question is about the clavicular and the answer is not because the question is related to the clavical when the clavicular muscle is tight if they play a card they will show pain in clavical.\nThe fourth question is not true because the question is related about the spectacles and if you wear a spectacle it won\u2019t make any sound and the first answer is the correct answer of the question.\nFinally, the last question is about the boredom and I can say that the correct answer is the first answer because", "answer": "A: watch film"}

{"text": "Choices:  A: B: C: D: E: E because he is in the everglades\n\nRational: 1. He is not in a new york, a low land, a forrest or nor is he in louisiana. He is in louisiana and he is on marsh. Also note that he is getting wetter. 2. The question is asking a specific location: the everglades. It seems to me that everglades sounds like an american colloquial way to saying swamp or marsh or low lands. The only choice out of the choices that really makes sense is the word everglades. 3. For any other choice there is no specific reason or logical explanation to why the man is going to be in the new york or louisiana or a forest or a swamp at the precise location of the man\n\n### Input :John felt sorry for himself when he lost his job, but the worst of it was he let himself go to what? Choices :  A: fat B: slim C: thin D: obese E: chub\n\n### Response :Choices :  A: B: D: E: A or C because let himself go to fat\n\nRational:1. We have to pick an answer that explains the worst of it is that he let himself go. It doesn't necessarily have to mean that he died, rather, he lost something he was used to having. And if he let himself go, it is likely he got fat.\n\n2. This reasoning is supported by the following facts :\n\n(1) The words \u201clet\" and \"go\" should not be interpreted in a direct and technical sense.\n\n(2) It\u2019s clear from context that he lost his job, which was bad for him but not physically terminal.\n\n(3) The other choices that might have seemed plausible at first - getting chubby is also not direct cause of unemployment (you should not get either physically unhealthy or worse financially unhealthy just because you have lost your job in a slumping sector of the economy).\n\n(4) Getting thin in response to unemployment just does not make sense (it may take a while after losing a job but once you find another job, you will gain weight back soon because you won\u2019t", "answer": "D: louisiana"}
{"text": "If one were to eat everything on the tastings menu, they would probably feel (gain) full.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question is posing a situation in which someone eats everything on the tasty menu, therefore they would be feeling full.\n2. Although the first three choices do make a point as to what the tasters are feeling, only B: getting full refers to the fact that eating everything on the menu might cause one to gain weight, which is not the most appropriate response for the scenario described.\n3.

Moreover, I did not include choice C in my first response because I didn't understand why the answer was \"outdoors.\" When I first saw \"outdoors,\" I naturally thought a snake would be released out of captivity, but then I thought about the \"exotic snakes\" that the question was asking about, and I realized that these snakes are typically in captivity. As a result, I added in my original response that \"exotic snakes are not outdoors where they'd be carried,\" so \"outdoors\" doesn't sound plausible to me anymore. As a result, maybe the \"outdoors\" answer is right, but I'd like to see a more clear explanation about the reasoning behind choosing it.\n\n#### Choices C and E: north america and outdoors\nMaybe this can be the answer. Perhaps there are so many people buying snakes that many people can purchase the snakes they want, and there is plenty of space within the United States, so people could just buy snakes elsewhere in the world from there.", "answer": "D: pet shops"}

Choices C and D are wrong as the signals could be loud noises that could possibly trigger fear or alarm to the pet resulting in a response from the pet. Therefore the only right choice is E.\nAnswer: E. Always\n\nInput: Although we have a lot of commonalities with the animal kingdom, humans are still unique. Which of the following are not human-like traits? Choices A. Walking on all fours B. Fatty tissue C. Able to reason D. Sweating glands E. Curiosity\n\n### Rationales:\n1. It's evident that human beings can walk on all fours, but this doesn't mean that they always do it.\n2. Therefore, even if walking on all fours was an attribute present in a majority of the animal kingdom, it doesn't preclude humans from having the capability to do so as well.\n3. Likewise, it's evident that humans do have fatty tissue, so this is a trait present in all mammals.\n\n### Choices B and D don't answer to the question as they do not state that they do not share an attribute with other mammals as well.\nChoice E is left out because humans are not born curious but rather become curious in time, with factors such as life experiences and educational aspects leading to curiosity. \nTherefore the right answer is:\n\nChoice C: Able to reason. \n\nInput: Even though some people may consider math a skill that is needed for everyone, it doesn't necessarily mean math is a useful subject for people who are not very good with it.

{"text": "Eating too much dinner is likely to cause acid reflux, a condition where the stomach contents come back up the esophagus and irritates the esophagus' lining. \n### Rationale: \n1. Eating too much is typically related to feeling full and tired. \n2. However, a general tiredness is less specific than a particular bodily ailment that is commonly caused by eating too much.\n3. Choices B and D do not mention an ailment or condition; the wording is more general, which doesn't fit the question.\n4. Choices C and E are both terms that are associated with problems due to how much digestion occurred.\n5. While feeling full can cause stomach aches, it does not directly lead to acid reflux.\n6. However, as acid reflux is a very specific condition, the likely cause of such a problem is the eating too much dinner by the end of the day/night.\n7.

{"text": "D: own house\n\n### Rationale:The question is asking for information on the likely qualities of grumpy people.\n\n### Considering the list of answer choices, the person is more likely to not have a headache, but a headache could be caused by various other reasons, so it is not necessarily a good representation of the nature of a grumpy person.\nThe person is more likely to understand themselves, but since the word \"likely\" is used in the question, the person doesn't necessarily have to understand themselves.\nHaving compliments, while positive, doesn't necessarily mean that a person is unhappy. In fact, the opposite could be true.\n\nSince owning a house is a more general trait and includes other factors that could affect a person's mood, it's safe to assume that the person has a house. Therefore, the answer is to be D: own house.\n\n### Input:\"The dog started to run, but after two minutes it lost its speed and came back.\" What caused the dog to run? Choices:  C: the wind B: the rain D: it didn't want to run E: it didn't feel like it\n\n### Response:\"It did not want to run\"\n\n### Rational:Choices A, B, C can be eliminated because in all the context it seems as if the owner is speaking about the dog.  \"The owner said...\" or \"I saw a dog, with his master...\" is evident.  It is not even clear if the dog really belongs to an owner, so D can't be an answer here either.\n\n### The statement makes it clear that \"it came back\" after the two minutes.  Nowhere does it suggest that the dog was running fast to begin with, so it can't be the case that it was tired.  Therefore, the dog chose not to continue running, because it \"didn't want to run.\"\nThis is the most logical explanation given the context.\n\nAnswer:\"It didn't want to\"\n\n### Input\"What do you call a man that works on an auto assembly line and does not like people?\" Choices:  A:\"The man with fourteen kids.\" B:\"Mechanic\" C:\"Soccer player\" D:\"Soccer Mom\" E:\"The man with ten kids\"", "answer": "A: headache"}

(2) He found a pinecone under his couch. (3) He found a dirty diaper under the kitchen sink. (4) Who dropped the dirty diaper?

He found the diaper under the kitchen.\nThus, from the information written above, the diaper was dropped in the kitchen that means that the dirty diaper must have been dropped by mom.\n\n### Choice: D\n\n### Input :\nThe best term could be used to call a large object that looks like an oblong?

{"text": "Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n### Demonstraion:\n\n1. Inference Question\n2. The question is asking \"what does he do all day\" and the choices given all refer to something that is answered via some form of communication.\n3. \"Hang up\", answer choices B and C refer to when someone leaves a phone call unanswered. Hang up can also mean to throw something away or to cease doing something. However, it is most likely the first usage \"to leave a phone call unanswer\" that the person who asks the question is referring to. So, answer choice B is the correct answer.\n4. The question is asking how he is hoping his offer will be received.\n5. It is unlikely that he is trying to attract ducks, so answer choice E will be omitted\n6. Although we have narrowed the choices down significantly from the previous answer choice option, answer choices A, C, and D are still the only remaining options.\n7. Choices A and C are both general forms of communication that do not give any concrete meaning of how the offer is hoping to be received and so answer choice A will be omitted\n8. Choices C and D both refer to how successful he is in communicating his offer, so C is the most correct answer but D cannot be ruled out.\n9. To say that he hopes that people will answer well will only say that he hopes to get a good reaction out of his communication, therefore neither answer D nor E would be incorrect\n10. Since C gives more information and gives a more definite meaning of what he hopes for, choice C will be the correct answer.\n11.

The question does not specify who is getting anger, it could be the individual getting drunk or someone near the drunken person. Someone who is getting angry usually has lower standards and might behave violently. In these cases, violence does not seem to be a behavior that the person would participate in. The question is asking about behavior that the person gets angry after gettng drunk is likely to participate in. It is clear that in case of anger, someone would behave violently. Therefore \"Violence\" is not the answer.\n\n\\strong{2. Vomit-} One who would be angry after gettign drunk would not be eating. One who is eatinng would not necessarily get angry. When a person vomits, in most cases, they are not angry or acting out of their character.

They learned architecture from ____________.  Choices:  A. apprenticeships B. schools C. family teaching D. government training E. unpaid internships \n\nRationales:\n1. The world's great architects in the past did not graduate from an architecture degree, they got their education from other sources rather than the school system. \n2. Looking at this example, the correct answer is the last option E. Unpaid internships are the closest option to this, because these were used as a way of doing apprenticeships.  Architects in Europe in the past did not pay anybody who would train them, which means that they would not pay people for their work experience. But, internships are a good way to get the work experience and training that architects had in the past, so this is a good solution because it mimics the way that architects in Europe got trained. \n3. The other answers do not quite fit because the question asks for the last option, which is an unpaid internship. If any were to choose them, an internship might not be a good choice, since it is unpaid, so we can eliminate those answers.\n4. A family teaching option would be a possibility, except that there wasn't always an apprentice or a family teaching someone. And apprentice also would not be the best option since it isn't the option the author is looking for. \n5. Schools and government training are out because they also don't match the author's request.\n6. Answers B and C are all eliminated too, because they do not match what the author is looking for, and since there weren't always a school or government program to train an architect, neither of they would be a good choice.\n7.

We already have the information they got ready and everything, this seems to not be what they are doing.\n\nB: being entertained - It tells us that a kid spends time on his things after getting ready. The words \"entertain\" and \"entertainment\" do not represent getting ready or anything like that.\n\nE: meet/meet up - This also doesn't seem to us about the information we know so far.

Yes you're right...Please.  Okay yes  Fatty Mcbutterchops\nRationales:\n1. Looking at the given sentences and the question, it appears that the speaker is responding to someone with a sentence and is asking for a response, such as \"Do you want to talk about it?\", \"You know I'm here for you\", \"Is there anything I can do?\", \"Should we take a mental health day?\", \"You know we care about you\", and \"I understand. Let's talk right now.\"\n2. The first thing that seems to be a response is the word \"sorry\" in the sentence \"I'm sorry.  [...]\"\n3. It could be argued that the sentence \"I' [...] is a response that is just part of the whole message, but this is still part of a full sentence.\n4. Therefore, the first response that appears to be a suitable answer is  \"Sorry\"?\n5. For a full response, the sentence \"Go away. No. By [...]\" is not an appropriate response but can not be excluded either.\n6. In the sentence \"You're right. [...]\" the speaker does not respond affirmatively or in any negating way, so we can safely exclude this response\n7. While the sentence \"Stop. Go. [...] Yes you're right [...]\" can be seen as a possible response, none of the other sentences is a suitable answer, but it would be reasonable to not exclude this one either\n8.

Similarly, \"quizzes\" is not the right option because not all quizzes directly relate to the grade given for a test.\n7.

{"text": "#### Option A: insubstantual\n\nInsubstantial is not a valid word option. It is used to describe a person who has no influence or impact. In this case, the choice is asking for an alternative title for the building, and all words mentioned have to do with structure and construction. Therefore, \"insubstantial\" would not be the proper title.\n\n#### Option B: massless\n\nMassless is not a valid word choice because it is associated more with mass. Massless is used to refer to a building, item, or even a person who has little to no mass associated with it.\n\n#### Option C: dwarf\n\nIn this case, it's important to note that dwarf could describe a building, however is is more commonly used as a term for people below average height. This would not be the correct option.\n\n#### Option D: inconsequential\n\nThis is a plausible choice; however, \"consequential\" describes the result or effect of an action, as opposed to the action itself. \"Inconsequential\" literally means \"not significant enough to matter or be important\", so we can say that an \"inconsequential\" building could be one that doesn't matter. However, it's most likely that this is not what the question is asking for, so we can disregard this option as not being the correct answer.\n\n#### Option E: Good\n\nThis particular choice is not possible because it would refer to a good building, as opposed to a non-constructed one. The question is asking us to find alternatives of what the massive building could be if it is not structured properly.\n\n#### Therefore, the correct Answer is C: Dwarf.\n\nAnswer: C: Dwarf", "answer": "A: insubstantial"}

Complete any of the numbered paragraphs.\n\nThis year's holidays are almost over. All students around the world had many things to do. Many of them had final exams and the others did not, but even the ones who had the final exams had other reasons to feel tired and sleepy during this period. In particular, students had to submit essays or oral reports for several subjects. They had to prepare many things for performances that teachers planned for students. At the same time, they were preparing for summer holidays. Teachers asked their students to prepare and practice many things for the performances. Even the students who did not have to take the exams had to give many assignments prepared for their classes. Finally, all the students had holidays in the morning and evening.\n\nFor these reasons, most students were too tired to read a book. When they were reading a book, they often skipped some important sentences. I think, most students will keep this habit even during regular school days.\n\nBecause parents took their children to amusement parks, movies and other places after school, they were tired to do the household chores. In addition, because there were many things to buy for summer holiday, prices were higher this year than ever. For these reasons, they did not have time to clean their houses.\n\nIn spite of these reasons, parents tried to clean the houses. Although most children slept without bathing, some children bathed. Some parents went to bed late and others were early to bed. Some children slept at 10:00 pm, while others slept in the evening.\n\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\nInput:  Many students had final exams _________________.\nChoices:  A: and they were very happy B: or they were very tired C: or they were very excited D: or they were very sleepy E: or they were very busy\n\nRationales:1.

{"text": "Choices: A: feel angry B: cross street C: drink tea D) complete sentence E: park\n\n\n### Rationales: \n1. The original statement tells us that the money being stolen from someone is a fact.\n2. One common way to react to such a fact by a person is to feel angry.\n3. So, choice B is the correct choice.\n4. There is another scenario where a person would be angry about being robbed, which is crossing the street. However, the question states that the individual still has the rest of his or her money and could choose where to cross the street. Therefore, that situation isn't the same as the fact presented in the instruction.\n5. The other choices are not likely choices that a person would make when someone stole his or her money, since these are more or less minor actions.\n6. Finally, there is no specific mention of a place to drink tea, hence the final choice, C, is the complete sentence.\n7.

{"text": "The chemical reaction that is often used as a source of heat is what is known as combustion. The general rule of thumb is that combustion is a controlled chemical reaction that involves the burning of hydrocarbon fuels such as propane or natural gas. This particular chemical reaction can be used as a source of light and energy, in addition to heat. In short, combustion is the reaction of fuel with the atmosphere and is one of the most common types of chemical reactions occurring in nature.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Combustion is a word that is familiar to many people and is commonly known to be the source of heat and energy.\n2. The word coal is an answer for the choice that is very specific to minerals while the other options are broad.\n3. The choice fire refers to a specific heat source.\n4. As for the phrase house, although it is an answer choice that is used in the sentence, it doesn't make sense as a particular type of combustion. For example, burning a house would refer to the destruction of a house, but not a reaction that is used as a source of heating.\n5. The choice solar energy refers to a source of energy while the given term describes heat of a different nature.\n\n## Tips\n\n1. Be mindful of time.\n\nIt may be tempting to take longer than the amount of time you are allotted to work, especially if you have not scored well on a test this year. However, consider that you will be taking the same test multiple times in the future. This practice exam should be treated as a \"dry run\" for a future exam. Take this practice test at a level that ensures you can accomplish the task. This could be finishing with 3 minutes to spare or finishing in an even amount of time with 5 minutes to spare. The goal is to work as efficiently as possible while still practicing under testing conditions.\n\n2. Remember you may re-take this test, no penalty is given because each test will be scored independently, with no penalty or added score penalty", "answer": "B: fire"}

According to the choices, John probably saw orphans, war, or battlefields before entering the army.\n3. It is more likely that John will see battlefields or orphans, as he is not already used to these things. \n4. As a new soldier, it is likely he hasn't been in the midst of a battle yet.\n5. He is only used to seeing dead bodies (B) if he is a doctor.\n6. Since battlefields would mean that John was wounded, it suggests that John is not used to seeing dead bodies or wounded soldiers.\n7.

It is clear that all of these could apply to swollen hands and feet, but the word that would best describe the situation is to swell. \n2.

{"text": "C\nA classroom is a more likely location for a note to be found indicating a melody than a fridge, envelope, medical chart or sheet music.  Classrooms are typically places where one would expect a note to have been left.  Sheets of music, on the other hand, may be in many locations if someone is learning music, while medical charts are found in medical offices, fridges are not usually found to contain notes indicating melodies, and envelopes, while generally used to transport something physical such as money, letters, etc, are not commonly used only to transfer a melody.  Hence, the correct answer is C: in a classroom.\n\n### Input : Where is a note likely to mention a melody? Choces:  A: pencil case B: sheet music C: medical record D: kitchen E: a classroom\n\n### Response : B\nSheet music often uses notes, but they may also have other information such as where to start playing (the top of the sheet music or \"begin\" on the fifth line, for example, or the first of 32 measures) or the number of pieces or verses it's composed of or how fast each piece should be played at.  Hence, it's possible for someone to leave a note on sheet music that is specific enough to only contain a melody with no other specifications.  Hence, note can appear in sheet music.\n\n### Note: Where is a melody usually written down?

However, radio shows are typically recorded on tape first, then a radio station can play the tape.  If the melody is recorded and then played on the radio, it's not necessarily written on paper (in sheet music, a radio DJ can also play music on the air without needing to own a piece of sheet music.  It's more likely that a piece of sheet music would be written down if someone went to purchase sheet music to play on the air.", "answer": "E: sheet music"}
{"text": "A: theater\n\nB: refrigerator\n\nC: bakery\n\nD: grocery store\n\nE: oven\n\nRationales: The question simply states that the speaker does not want to go baking himself a cake because he would rather go do something else.\n\nA: the question is asking where he or she would go if they did not feel like baking a specific cake themselves.\nB: the sentence implies that \"baking a cake\" refers to a general type of baking, not a specific type of baking for a specific time. This makes refrigerator a good choice because every baked item that could be in a house would be in the refridgerator, but would not necessarily have to be a cake.\nC: a bakery is a specific type of place that sells cakes and baked items that would require more preparation and time. The question is stating that baking a cake does not take much time or preparation, so it could be done quickly as soon as possible, which indicates that \"bakery\" is not applicable.\nD: grocereies are not necessarily baked items or foods, but products that you buy for ingredients to make cakes or baked goods. Hence, this is not the place to go to get a cake to bake.\nE: the question is asking if you do not want to bake a cake, where would you go to bake it. The oven is not a place where you could get a cake or a baked item, but it is the place where you bake/cook an item.

{"text": "C: preschool\n\n#### Rationale:The question reads The spoiled child's massive playroom was only one of many rooms. This means that the child's massive play room was one of many rooms within the child's residence. \n\n#### The phrasing indicates the child's house. The playroom can be one of many rooms in a child's home, but we're looking for the child's overall residence, so we don't need to know which room the playroom is in reference to.\n\n#### We also know that the question indicated the answer choice was massive, which tells us the child's residence must be large as the playroom is massive. \n\n#### Since an individual's preschool and elementary school might include a few classrooms. The playroom may be one of many rooms within their house.\n\n#### The other answer choices indicate a reference to a very specific area that may not necessarily be the biggest residence to a child:\n\n1.  The big house indicates a large area or complex which would not necessarily be the actual residence to one child.\n2.  Nursery school would not be a part of the child's residence, it would be an educational environment\n3.   Preschool is a very specific place to attend for an individual, it would be a small-group setting.\n4.   The building might be an entire school or other institution the child attends.\n5.  The retirement home may be a specific unit or even a small area of the community the child attends.

So then, we only have the choices B and C. While keeping people healthy seems like it could be an important aspect of what doctors do, it is not defined as an explicit job requirement to work with diseased people and work with sick people to keep people healthy, so according to what we are given these are not choices that can be correctly answered. Moreover, being very careful for detail does not necessarily mean more qualified to treat patients, it is not part of being a doctor to be that careful for every detail.\n\n### As far as John's duties as a doctor, we have the options A, B, and C. Since he is a doctor he tends to work with sick people, which does not imply he is always careful for detail (if anything, keeping people healthy and being careful for detail are seemingly contradictory to each other). We also know he tends to keep people healthy. Therefore, we can determine that his specialty seems to be in working with sick people. Hence, A is correct.", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

{"text": "In fact when the cow came out of the barn after the storm passed, its coat was completely wet. In fact, its coat looked like a different color after the storm, which is why the correct answer is A: meat grinder.\n### Rationales: \n1.The meaning of the question is clear- if not what would a cow come out wearing after the storm passed? \n2. The choices given are each a place or thing that the cow would typically be found- its meat grinder, stable, gate, red barn, and green field. \n3. If the cow had been wet after the storm, she would typically stand out in her wet green coat while the others are dry.\n4. Hence the answer is meat grinder, because she would be the only wet one.\n5. Another question similar to this one would be, \"What is the correct term when describing the color of the clothing the person is wearing?\" \n6. The answer to that would be the answer to this question, A- meat grinder.\n7. If a person is outside of the house and suddenly starts to wear a different color of clothing, then obviously a coat is being changed, and meat grinder is the best answer.\n8. Thus, the correct answer is C.\nAnswer: A: meat grinder\n\n### Input\n\n### The cow would come outside even a storm had passed. In fact, whenever it did, its coat was completely dry.

Its coat got wet after the storm but was dry afterwards\n\n### The meaning of the question is clearly defined by the title. \n\n### A: If its coat was green before the storm, then it was green afterwards too.\n\n### B: If something is wet from a storm, then it stays wet until after a storm passes. \n\nB: Is the correct answer. \n\n## Explanation:  C: The cow would still have a wet coat even though the storm had passed and therefore would be green on the outside as well as the inside.\nA: The coat would still be green before and after the storm.\nB: The cow would still be green after the storm even though it is dry", "answer": "C: red barn"}

{"text": "### Demonstion:\n\n### Rationales and Clarification:\nChoices A and B are dismissed since they refer to being awake and alert.\n\nChoice C is too broad.\n\nChoice D is not well defined, so it is dismissed.\n\nChoice E seems like the only relevant choice, since \"being awake\" means knowing what's going on, and the only thing that we assume would relate to knowing what's going is your eyes being open.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is choice E: conscious.\n\n1. The person's answer choice choices would be considered to be A: Awake, and B: Alert and awake.\n2. However, Choice A: Awake would not work as it does not indicate being alert.\n3. Choices B: Alert, and B: Awake would not also work as being alert relates to being awake and being awake refers to being \"aware of one's surroundings\" as opposed to being \"alert\", but this also does not indicate knowing what is going on.\n4.

{"text": "The correct answer is E. What could be happening to your skin if the air is getting cold? Choices:  B: dry C: itchy D: sweaty E: oily\n\n### Rationales\n1. Given that the first question states that the ground is getting wet, it is reasonable to assume that the second question would be related to the ground.\n2. The first question asks for a word that describes something that could be happening if the ground is getting\n3. wet, while the second question asks for a word to describe something that could be happening near the ground if the air is getting\n4. cool or cold.\n5. The second question does not directly ask what specifically could be happening to a person's skin near the land while the air is getting cold.\n      6. It just asks for a word that could indicate a situation that could be occurring near the land as the ground is getting wet.\n      7. Therefore, given that the first question asked for a word that could be happening if a circumstance occurs, the phrase \"the air is getting cold\" is not relevant to what could be happening near you since this would not be the cause of why the ground is getting wet as implied by the phrase \"near you\".\n       \n      8. Since the response describes a situation that could be going on near you when your skin is getting cold, this\n        answer would most certainly fit the first question better, which asks for a word that indicates what could be happening near\n        you during a circumstance.

{"text": "If you want to describe Joe as for the decision, combine \"against\" and \"opposite\" since you're combining words.\nThe other responses are either redundant combinations such as for the decision or are grammatically incorrect such as A (there's no being \"for decisions\" in general).\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The \"conceptual\" choice A for or conjunction has limited use as being for the decision and being against the decision is being for or against the decision, which makes the conjunction redundant.\n2. The word \"decision\" requires two choices- either for or against.  To simply say \"conjunction\" or \"for or against\" is redundant since it will ultimately be one of the two choices.\n3. Also, if one would think the conjunction as another choice it would be redundant since you are then saying either \"for\" or \"against\"- in which case, the correct answer would be either E or D.\n4. Thus the answer is neither A, B, nor C.\n5. The answer is D: for or against the decision.\n6. This choice can be broken down as the words \"for\" or \"or\" can replace the word \"being\" or \"combined\" in \"for being/combined together\" can be simplified to be the answer.\n7. We can also then simplify the other choices.  Being for can be interpreted as \"combined\".\n8. Or is combined with \"opposite\", making one be against \"for\", which is being against the decision.\n9. Being against combined can be simplified as being against.  Therefore D: for or against is the correct choice.\n10. Hence we are left with E or D.\n11. The word \"conjunction\" refers to a word or combination of words which indicates relationship.

In order to answer the question based on the information provided, we should be looking for a bookstore in a physical location.\n4. Therefore the correct choice is A: town.

Ruth is asking where Beth can find a book store, it is not clear if Beth can locate the book store in the same location where Ruth is, or if Ruth wants to find a different bookstore.\n3. In this example, Beth wants to suggest a location, so she has to ask a question with what information.\n4. The question is asking if Ruth knows where to find the bookstore. If the answer to the question is yes, then Ruth needs to inform Beth where to find it.\n5. If the answer to her question is no, then Ruth will have to provide more information, whether or not she knows where to find the books store.\n\nThe question Ruth asked should be formatted as a question asking for where a particular thing or location can be found.\n\nRuth: Where can I find a bookstore?\n\nRuth can now tell Beth where and or how to find a book store from a town in her locale.\n\n### Note: If Ruth would ask where a book store is located, her question might be misinterpreted as she is looking for a bookstore, and doesn't know its physical location.

You should do your most to appreciate what they have done or accomplished, because by appreciating people for what they\u2019ve done it makes you and them look great. However, if you are thinking of ways on how to make them not feel appreciated or complimenting someone else that it would make the other person feel. That isn\u2019t really a good thing and would not add on to the relationships that they have with that other person.\n\nIt is important to appreciate and be appreciated for what each and everyone of us have accomplished throughout our day. Do not look at negative thoughts before you go in for the day. Instead, look at the ways to make it through a long day successfully than looking at all that bad thoughts that you may have about yourself. If you do so, you will have a much better time than you could have of if you tried to think of all the bad thoughts before you had even started your day. In trying to make everything that you could through the day be successful and good, you may also accomplish so much more compared to the things that you could had done.\n\n### [Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question]\n\n### Demand:\n\n>The world is facing one of the greatest crises ever known to the human race.

The answer should be B: spending money.\n\n### Explain:Desire is an intrinsic motivation that one has for a particular product without necessarily knowing what to buy.  It does not take money and time in order to use it.  One can have desire for a product but not necessarily be able to buy it because one does not have spending money.\nSimilarly, needs are one's wants and desires, and thus, one does not have needs if he does not have time to go shopping. As for money, it would certainly be helpful for shopping, but one could be lacking in money while having a desire and a need for a particular product.\nTherefore, one would have to have some funds in order to purchase something.  We would choose the option that requires spending money which implies to have that money already.", "answer": "C: money"}

{"text": "The possible ways to cope with stress-related issues such as depression and grief are counselling and therapy. While grieving is an emotionally exhausting experience, it also helps us deal with the stressor and process it in a productive way. Furthermore, grief can be alleviated by talking to people that are closest to us and receiving support. This helps to minimize the negative effect or grief, and thus minimizes its negative emotional and health effects. Counselling and support from others helps individuals through the process of mourning (McDonald, 2007). So it is not surprising that A is the correct answer here. Depression, on the other hand, takes a long time to go away but can be reduced with treatment and lifestyle habits such as regular exercise and a healthy diet. Furthermore, depression can be alleviated or treated with medication and therapy (McDonald, 1997). So, it is not reasonable to assume that depression could cause death. As for hair loss, it could be a result of prolonged stress or anxiety but it is unlikely that it could be fatal in a person's life because it is most likely a temporary condition that will disappear by itself. Hair loss in a female may also be a result of an underlying condition or disease such as thyroid imbalances, a side effect of medication, hormone disorders and more. Hence, it is not a direct result of stress and would not likely cause the death of a grieving person. \n\nFinally, headache could be a symptom of stress, but again, it is a temporary discomfort. Furthermore, it is more of a transitory condition that usually goes away with the passage of time. Moreover, a person should not die from headaches unless there is something else wrong. So C and E are incorrect. D has been dismissed because the depletion of the physical and mental energy is more likely to lead to death if not treated, and not hair loss to make it cause death. Therefore, B is the correct answer here since it is the only choice which will lead to death as a direct result that would directly affect the question of \"if not treated\".\n\nAnswer: B: heart attacks\n\n### Instructions:\n\n#### Input:\nA nurse is always careful to follow the prescribed therapy for an", "answer": "B: heart attacks"}

{"text": "C: opera\n\n### Rationale:\nThe phrase \"paper program\" refers to a printed paper of a program or schedule. According to Oxford, \u201ca paper schedule of a theatrical production (as a play, opera, or film)...used as a handout to the public in advance (as of a concert).\u201d (Oxford, 2022) Therefore the answer will either be C: opera or B: computer.\n\nThe option A: theater is incorrect because the phrase \"paper program\" is not applicable for this scenario. A theater is a venue where live plays, operas, operettas, and musicals are performed. The phrase \"paper program\" cannot be found in this context, since it is not commonly used and doesn't have a direct relation in the sentence.\n\nThe option B: computer is incorrect because \"program\" is used to refer to the plan of an artistic or entertainment event. This doesn't fit the situation, where the paper program will be used for a live event, in this case, opera. (Oxford, \u201cpaper program,\u201d 2022). When opera is played live, they use a paper program.\n\nAlso, \"paper program\" refers more for \"theater\" or \"drama\", not \"concert\" or \"television\" or \"radio\", thus the correct answer will be C: Opera.

This way, the customer knows how much they will be able to borrow from the lending institution and they can budget accordingly. Lenders normally set a budget amount within a certain range and the buyer will be told how much money they are allowed to borrow. The buyer, therefore, needs to save for a deposit and make the necessary deposit for the down payment in order to have enough money to pay the house. This will ensure that they can afford the house and their monthly mortgage pay", "answer": "C: opera"}

He decided against going home and asked the taxi driver to take him to what? Choices  A: the airport  B: a caf\u00e9 C: a bar D: the movies E: a friend's place\nRationales:1. This question is asking where the passenger wants to go as an alternative to home.\n2. \"Home\" could be understood as referring to residential, not in terms of the passenger's actual physical house.\n3. Hence, a caf\u00e9, a bar, a friend's place are all plausible places that the passenger could go, rather than going to the airport, where they would be heading if they were returning home.\n4. Since the passenger is a man, the choice of going to a \"movie\" is not likely plausible, as it is assumed that the man does not want to watch a movie.\n5. This leaves choices A, B and C (a caf\u00e9, a bar or a friend's place) as the plausible options.\n\n6. Among these, a caf\u00e9 might not be appealing on such a dark and rainy day, which decreases the likelihood that the passenger would want to go there.

{"text": "C: ocean\n\n## Description:\nThe shoreline was, at one point a bustling and active source of fishing, but now it is a tourist attraction, including nearby little shops. The phrase 'what once was' indicates that the shore used to be actively engaging in fishing, but now has turned into something else; more specifically, a tourist attraction. So, the shore used to be what? We need to get as specific as possible. The first thing that comes to mind is that it used to be an ocean, or a body of water that people can't see in from where they are standing. The question gives us enough context as well as detail to answer this question precisely. Additionally, the phrasing of \"shore was\" means that the question refers to a specific point in time, so it is safe to assume that the answer is still \"shore\" and not ocean which is a body of water.\n\nThe choices that can be considered as an answer are now narrowed down to: A, B, and C.\n\nA) Seaside town does not really qualify as it doesn't specifically include a body of water. Also, the sentence indicates that the shore at the time used to be an active source of fishing. Seaside towns do not just mean a place with seaside. More concretely, a seaside town is a town located by the sea. (Oxford online)\n\nB) A resort indicates a place that has been turned into something more touristy than at the time. It seems to imply that the shore had been turned into a resort area in the past. The resort area is a place where tourists go to vacation and have a good time. However, it can't be the answer because it says \"is now\" and not \"used to be\". Also, \"shore\", as stated, has not been turned into a resort.\n\nC) The coast used to be a commercial fishing area, but is now a tourist attracion, including nearby little shoppes, is still a good summary. While some people used the fishing industry as an outlet for their income, many of them have left in search of opportunities to live off of tourism. \"coast\" also answers the question for \"shore\".\n\nE) Beach is a broader concept.

{"text": "Choices C and D, corner and school building.\n\n### Rationales:The question implies that the shelf was \"showing signs of instability\", so there is a worry that the shelf may crack or collapse. Given that the shelf is already unstable, choosing to fix a corner or a school building might cause it to lose more instability and collapse further. Moreover, if the carpenter fixed the corner, then in the likely event that the shelf does crack or fall, the carpenter might be blamed due to the corner being his responsibility. Or if the carpenter repaired the roof, one would expect that the roof would be able to withstand further impact.  The question even states that the shelf will \"have issues\" if the carpenter does not fix it. Therefore, choices C and D, fixing the corner and school building, respectively, might cause more instability and would be very risky.\n\n### Input :If you\u2019re looking for a good time, then check out this bar which offers 3 nights a week until 8 pm and they also do happy hour!\n\n### Rationale:The above sentence states that the bar offers 3 nights of happy hour starting at 8 PM. \n\n\n- [x] 1.

A play is generally performed with actors, a storyline, costumes, etc.\n\nTherefore, we can reject \"play\", as its possible the audience is merely watching a performance.\n\n\u2022 A cabaret or a theatrical performance (theatrical performance):\n\nCabaret and theatrical performance are both performed on a stage. Theatrical performances are more serious in nature and can involve dramatic arts such as plays or musicals. Meanwhile, cabaret is often more of a comedic, lighter form.\n\nBecause of this distinction, we reject Cabaret, however, we can still consider theatrical performance. Because, although play and movie are two possible ways of watching a performance, cabaret is not, theater performance is a possible way of watching a performance. \n\n\u2022 A conference (conference):\n\nConference is also a word that describes a form of representation and performance.

Thus the word must be used consistently - but not all of these meanings would apply in this sentence. 1 & 2 are possible meanings, and it seems that an answer might be C: cool down, but would the sun 'drop quickly'? No. 3 seems the obvious alternative, but it would not be used in the sense of 'the sun began to grow', it would be used for 'the temperature began to grow'. So this leaves you with possible answers 4 - an oxymoron would be 'the sun is beginning to decrease in size' or 'the sun is beginning in size'.

The question asks for the location where the wife told him to check when he complains about missing deodorant.\n7. Choices A, B, C, and E mention personal items that could potentially be in somebody's armpits.\n8. Choice B suggests that the grocery store could be located in another room aside from his own bathroom. This is not supported by the context of the question.\n9. Choice D implies that his own bathroom is not the right location to find missing deodorant. This would not be likely, especially from a wife, though it would be ironic if his wife was referring to his own bathroom as the armpits.\n10. Choice E references a location for a medicine cabinet that the author doesn't refer to in the question. \n11. Therefore, the only suitable choice is for the location in his bathroom where he'd likely to find deodorant or where she asked him to inquire about it. \n12.

{"text": "The best answer choice is E: social activism.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe best answer is given based on its comprehensiveness. While changing yourself might be a part of being at the forefront of a movement, not every movement necessarily has a focus on changing oneself. This is why \"change yourself\" is not the best choice. While riots can lead to change on a broader scale, it may be difficult to say that it is \"within society\". Thus it is not the best option. Change clothes is dismissed as a choice because the question said \"doing this\" and clothes changing does not necessarily have a direct relationship to doing something. This leaves the options \"vote\" and \"social activism\". Vote could be considered, but social activism is more well-rounded because it can include voting, voting in particular can change oneself. Therefore the best answer is E: social activists\n\nAnswer: E: social activism\n\n### Input : I know its clich\u00e9, but don't give up.

{"text": "## Instructions\nBelow is an instruction that describes an analysis. Answer the prompt.\n\n### Input (with analysis): John, for example, may have been thoughtful in his examination of the corpus. He missed the real cause because he didn't take as much time as necessary in his examination. He wouldn't have missed the cause of death if he conducted a more in- depth examination.\n\n### Analysis: John didn't complete his examination because he was careless, thoughtless, or hurried.\n### Rationale: Choice B\n\n### Demystified\nAnalyzing the prompt:  <br>\nThe instruction begins with the phrase \"For example, John\". However, there is no example immediately after. Thus, one could not assume that what follows would necessarily be an example of John's, and it would be necessary to look to the instruction to see if any other examples had been provided previously and if a similar pattern exists.\n1. The prompt initially states that John may have been thoughtful.\n2. Then the pronoun \"He\", which refers to John, appears.\n3. Next, a \"missed\" appears, which might signify something that was missed or overlooked in his examination.\n4, The pronoun \"his\" refers to John again, which we see as a pattern in the instruction.\n5. The term \"examination\" appears once, which could refer to the initial examination that John had done or it could be the more thorough examination that he did not do.\n6. Then the word \"everything\" appears, followed by \"required of him\". This describes the examination John did complete, suggesting that the complete examination would have included everything that was required of him.\n7. If the requirement is the same, the same examination would not contain any element that John did not do during his thorough examination.\n8. Then, the first of the choices appears, which could fit into this situation, and thus be a potential cause.\n9. However, there are several terms in this choice (\"careless\", \"thoughtless\", and \"hurried\") that might cause someone to examine the corpse hastily and only briefly. Therefore, it would likely be more accurate to say that the cause was something else that caused him to be casual, thoughtless, or rushed during his", "answer": "E: blisters"}
{"text": "---\n\n### Choice:A\n\nRationales:\n1.A farm is a working area of land in which farmers grow crops and rear animals. This is a generic term that refers to land, but is not specific to any region, so it does not fit the scenario.\n2. An ancient Rome refers to an ancient civilization that existed in Europe. This refers to a nation, not a region, so it is not relevant here.\n3. A history book is a particular book or collection of books that contains information about historical people, events, and ideas. History refers to a whole category of people and events, not a specific region, therefore this would not be relevant here.\n4. A poor country refers to a country that is economically underdeveloped, with lower rates of income and higher rates of poverty. While this category may have been applicable to southern institutions during the time when slavery existed, it does not provide a better understanding of the scenario, instead it becomes a matter of inference, because these are usually categorized according to GDP rather than geography. Therefore, it does not apply.\n5. A plantation is a large piece of land used for farming, especially for growing cotton and tobacco. This is a more specific option that describes a region, more specifically southern geographical regions such as the Caribbean and the Southern United States.\n6.Therefore the correct answer is B: plantation\n\nInput: What term describes something that can be changed but doesn't change itself to how you expect? Choices: \tA: immoveable  B: change  C: flexible  D: fixed E: uncontrollable\nRationales:1.  The question expects a term to be provided to describe something that can be changed, but doesn't change according to the user's expectation.\n2.\tThe options mentioned do not describe this kind of phenomenon.\n3.\tE.g. immoveable cannot be changed according to any expectation.\n4.\tChange, flexible, and uncontrollable do not seem to be the correct fits.\n5.\tHowever B. fixed does imply that something is unchangeable once used, i.e. it is stable and does not affect any other aspect in the system, or the use of it is not affected by any other aspect in the environment. \n6.\tTherefore", "answer": "E: plantation"}

The question is if a person is afraid of spiders, they should avoid owning what in the cellar the person avoids.\n2. Mailed is a form of sending or sending to a place. For example, mailing packages or sending emails to a friend abroad\n3. I chose this option because the word used is'should' and is past tense, so the answer must be in the past tense as well.\n\nAnswer: D: Mailed the spiders in the cupboard.\n\n### Input :A. Fear B.

That's why he needs to possess all virtures and learn from the fault. Answer : B: Virtue\n\n### Rationale\n\n1. The question was about a word beginning with F. Fear is the answer to C. Virtue means having certain qualities and also learning from own faults means it should be virtue because a person needs to have perfection.\n2. So we should choose the correct answer that is B: Virtue.\n\n### Answer B\n\n### Input\nC. 1. When is it most proper to wear silk? A. Around the house; in a casual climate B.

If children do in fact get confused, they may do one of the things that are mentioned in the options.\n3. However, the options don't really address the scenario given from the question, nor do they make much sense.\n4. Choices A and B seem unrelated. \"Getting lost\" is also not relevant here.\n5. Choices C and D are strange combinations as well.\n6. Choices E and F are the best choices. These are actions that could be taken by confused children. Children may get to the wrong place, but they would be at the correct house, whereas children getting \"set table\" would indicate they've gone to someone else's house.\n7. Since choice E and F are appropriate answers, the answer to the question is E and F: None of the others.\n\nAnswer: E, F: None of the Others\n\nInput: A lot of people have different ideas of how to raise children, but which type is least risky? Choices: \nA: let them do things however they want B: let their parents do things C: let them pick out their own food D: have others be in charge\nRationales:\n1. The phrase \"how to raise children\" is used and implies that many people have an opinion about how best to do this based on their own experience.\n2. The phrase \"but which type is the least risky\" indicates that people will have different opinions and this is based on what they believe it takes to have successful children.\n3. This seems to suggest that \"the least risky\" is something that some people feel is the best approach. \n4. With that in mind, if a person had to choose which is the least risky approach, these will be the obvious options.\n5. Option A is \"let them do things however they what?\" What does this even mean? This choice does not make sense and seems to be written to confuse the reader.\n6. Option B is \"let their parents do things\". This option is vague and not specific.\n7. This sounds more like letting a parent tell his/her own kids what to do, rather than letting the children choose their own path in life, which would seem to be more applicable to the", "answer": "C: wrong house"}
{"text": "C\n\n### Rationales:\n1. It is clearly stated that \u201cThe graveyard was to be built, where should it be located?\u201d (emphasis added). It is unclear whether you should respond with the location of the graveyard or the location of the cemetery (since the graveyard is being built where the location of the cemetary will be). There is ambiguity in the question. \n2. Choice A has the word \u201carlington\u201d which seems out of context. The rest of the choice is \u201cchurch property out back every town cemetery\u201d. Church property out back makes sense and is an option for the choice, but cemetery is not used as a form of expression as a noun in the question. It is a form of expression as an adjective, but even then, it is followed by \u201ccattle,\u201d which makes the choice seem more like it\u2019s referring to a cow, and this would not explain why the question\u2019s graveyard is being build. \n3. Choice B doesn't seem to fit the question because the question does not specifically mention a church (other then it being one of the locations), so to respond with church property outback could be misleading since the answer of the question is actually a graveyard being made in a graveyard. \n4. The only answer that makes sense is \u201cwhere should it be located?\u201d which could be taken as where the graveyard will be located or where the cemetery will be located. \n5.

He was found guilty despite being innocent. The man did not get credit for time served. Life did mean 30 years.\n\n### Response 1:\nRationale:\n\nLaw was changed so now life means 15 years\n\nInput : He was found guilty of murder, however why would the judge think this was true, given that the only person there to testify was a witness who was clearly lying and it clearly was self defense? The witness said, \"John stabbed him and he ran after him to stop him from hurting anyone else\". It is clearly not true that John stabbed him, given that John was nowhere near the witness when the witness was stabbed. There is no video evidence that John stabbed anyone because it happened in the dark, and John was nowhere near. Also the witness was clearly lying when he told the police that John stabbed. The only reason anyone would have believed the witness was to cover up for John. Also the witness stabbed him in the stomach when he ran away.  How could that have possibly killed him?\n\n\n### Response", "answer": "D: were very tired"}

People have the choice to have friends or not to have them and to engage or not to engage in conversation based on the available options available.

Therefore the thing he looked down longingly was something he missed, or something he had to look down to obtain.\n4. Choices A does not seem like something he looked down to.\n5. Choices B would seem to make sense, but the context makes it possible that the man was looking out to space, not down, at least based on the clues in the question.

A trip- which would be too long to get to the train station from the house as it is not far away- C. A shuttle (this cannot be used from a house to a train station, as shuttles seem to only operate between points of interest)- D.

{"text": "Input: The swimming pool couldn't be refilled because of drought regulations, which was in the park. Choices:  A. school B. first floor C. California D. YMCA E: park\nRationales: The word \"where\" implies location. The swimming pool couldn\u2019t be refilled because it was in California. I think I understand what they\u2019re getting at with California, considering that that\u2019s where the state of California would be, but then you take into consideration that the drought regulations also involve watering the grass. With the phrase, \u201cthe grass couldn\u2019t be watered because of drought regulation,\u201d then you figure out that the grass was in the park. This is my understanding of what the choice D was referring to. Choice C is incorrect, because if it was located in the park, then it wouldn\u2019t go in the first floor, because you\u2019d have to go up the staircase to go to the pool. Choice B is incorrect because if it was located on the school\u2019s first floor, then it would be located in the park.

The patient did not understand what it implies, so he asked the meaning of \"to start taking the water\".\nThe patient's question implied he knows \"taking the water\" is something that the doctor usually tells his patient to do, so he was not completely confused about the statement.\nChoices:\nA. mean\nThe doctor's statement \"the patient should start ____the water\" means that \"the patient should start drinking more water\".\nChoices:\nB. imply\nTo imply means to suggest.

In this question, line refers figuratively to a particular kind of flattery, or the attempt to attract one's interests or love.2. Choice A is grammatically correct, but not correct in meaning. Fling is never used to describe flattery, so we can eliminate it.3. Choice B is correct, but not specific. It means to get action, not seduction.4. Choice C is grammatically correct, however, it is not specific to flattery. Winning someone over includes more than flattery, and it does not mean to get action, and so is not a good answer.5. Choice D is grammatically correct but does not refer to flattery, so it will not work, as seduction and seducing means to try to make someone in love with you.6.

{"text": "1. Demonstration: \n\nThe correct answer is: Bigger brain!\n\nResponse: \nWhen I study more, if I really put forth effort, I will gain more knowledge. That knowledge gives me more ideas, more connections, and just more to think about. All of that more can lead to my brain growing. The answer is not A,B,C or D. As for the last part of the question, it is not asking what you will gain more. Instead the question is asking what will happen with your knowledge. A bigger brain is when your brain grows. It doesn't specifically say with more knowledge, but instead it could be the more knowledge. I know that this answer is not really very popular. A bigger brain doesn't really make sense with my limited knowledge of biology. This is the response that I would give to the question at hand.\n2. Self reflection: I think that the less popular answer that I gave makes sense when it comes to the question being asked. Knowledge just gives us more things to think about and so my brain grows. I guess it also comes down to how we define size. In high school I got bigger but I wasn't taller. I wasn't actually bigger with a scale because I was only bigger in other terms.

{"text": "B\n\n### Why:\n1. While it may seem that A and B could be acceptable choices, neither one adequately provides a good reason for attenting school.\n2. \"Attending\" is a form of the verb \"to attend\"; attending school means going to school; it is a verb, not a noun. \"A good reason\" does not refer to school itself, but a reason to go to school.\n\n### 2. If you say that a person is \"attending school\", you mean that he is going to school or spending time in class.\n3. \"A good reason for attending\" does not tell us what school is. It could mean \"a good reason to go to school\", but that would be asking for a reason to attend school, not a good reason for attendant.\n4. Thus, it would not make sense to say that a good reason for attendening is school itself, so the correct choice is B: boredom, because it is the only option that makes sense out of the choices given.\n\n### Input:\"Why are you here?\" he asked the thief.

{"text": "#### Choice A\nInput: A person riding in a car was asked if he would stop at a red light, at which point he replied, \"How long is a piece of rope?\" Choices:  A. Yes B. No\nRationales: Red light is interpreted as stop. The driver is asked to stop at red light. The driver was asked to stop. If he doesn't stop, then he wouldn't reply to stop at the red light. The driver does not stop at the red light, he says \"how long is a piece of string.\" Therefore he is giving a confusing reply to the question.\n#### Choice B\nInput: If the person on the left of the photograph held a cup of coffee and the person on the right held a cup of tea, which situation would most likely take place? Choices: A) They would both start to laugh B) They would both start arguing C) They would both drink out of their cups at the same time D) They would both sip at their cups at the opposite times.\nRationales: Both people would start drinking out of their cups to avoid any arguments or any uncomfortable situation. They may still sit next to each other, but they may not want to talk. They may start to laugh as well.\n#### Choice D\nInput: They were having trouble finding a person to help them, but they knew a man named Jack in the office of the ___________ would like the task.

{"text": "### Choice: the question is asking why people who were in attendance of the play would stand up during its performance. So, we are looking for a word or phrase that indicates they stood up because they were standing in admiration or to experience the performance. It might seem counterintuitive to pick the word \"experience\" here because admiration is not a very specific term. However, it was chosen because it fits with the word or phrase and it is the only answer that is most specific in relation to the specific thing the question is asking for. Choice B is incorrect because it is about something that has occurred and not necessarily about the new play, which suggests the play is still happening. Choice C is incorrect because applaud means to express admiration for something. The people who stand during the play are not doing it to express their admiration for the performance but rather, to experience the play itself and the answer should reflect that. Choice D is incorrect, because experience means the act of undergoing an activity or something. This does not necessarily require standing still during a performance. Choice E is incorrect because sleep is not a word that best answers the question. Choice A is incorrect because \"make a reservation\" means to prepare something for later, it would not be reasonable to think the people would come back to admire the play or to make reservations to see the play later. The best option is choice E: experience, the people standing are standing in admiration for the play, not to express admiration or to prepare later.

{"text": "Science is the study of the physical and material world and encompasses various branches such as biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, and geology. As such, learning about science can significantly impact one's perspective on the natural world and their understanding of how it works.\n\nOne of the ways in which science can affect a person's views is through their appreciation of nature. Learning about the complex processes underlying the functioning of natural systems can help individuals gain a deeper appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the world around them. This could lead to a heightened sense of wonder and awe towards the natural world. For example, learning about the intricate biological machinery that allows organisms to function and interact would likely increase a person's appreciation for the complexity and beauty of nature, leading to a greater sense of wonder and a greater appreciation for the natural world.\n\nAnother way in which science can affect one's views is by providing a more thorough and refined understanding of how things work. As human civilization has progressed, science has played a vital role in uncovering the mysteries of the universe and gaining a deeper and more nuanced understanding of how the world works. Learning about science can provide individuals with a more thorough and accurate understanding of the world around them, which can help them to see things more clearly and make more informed decisions.\n\nIn addition to these effects, science can also have a significant impact on one's excitement about learning. Through science, individuals can gain a deeper appreciation and excitement for the process of discovery and the joy of learning. As individuals discover new and interesting facts about the world, their excitement for learning will likely increase, leading to a greater joy in learning and a greater appreciation of the natural world.\nFinally, increased knowledge of science can lead to increased knowledge about a wide range of topics, including the human body and how it functions. As individuals explore scientific concepts and theories, they can gain a more thorough understanding of the complex systems that make up the human body, leading to a greater appreciation and understanding of the inner workings of the human body.\n\nTherefore, while all of these ways science can affect one' s views are significant, an increased understanding of science can lead to appreciate and joy in learning, as such, it is not easy to tell which of the five items listed above has the most significant effect.\n\n### Input How has the", "answer": "E: see things differently"}
{"text": "The correct response is DE. This is the only choice that directly addresses the specific concern of traffic. The others are not directly relevant to determining the source of congestion.\n\n### Rationale\n\"Suffer from\" can mean \"come from\" or \"be caused by,\" as well as \"suffer from.\" Therefore, \"traffic\" may refer to the source of this traffic, the cause of this traffic's worsening, or the fact that traffic exists. However, the context in which this sentence resides makes this task simple. There is little speculation needed because the problem is clearly defined and thus easy to solve. Any traffic is clearly going to be congestion on the expressway, thus the traffic coming from everywhere around the expressway is directly relevant and is the most likely culprit.\n\n### Answer\nOption d: \"country\" does not fit since it is not directly related to traffic's worseness, which is the focus of the sentence. The others refer to other issues other than traffic, specifically \"michigan\" and \"map\", neither of which actually fit the context.\n\n### Input:\"The man's friend had nothing but what?\" Choices:  A\" nasty words for him to describe his friend's bad behaviour\" B\" bad words to describe his friend' nose\" C\" nasty words to describe his own personal defects\" D\" really bad nose\" E\" really bad behaviour\n\n### Response\nThe correct response is D: \"bad nose.\" The word \"but\" implies that there is opposition between the two ideas. The word \"really bad\" contrasts with the preceding qualifier \"few.\" Therefore, \"nose\" makes the most sense. It is the only option that does not mention another trait, such as \"behaviour\" or \"reputation\" (option E) that is relevant to the context. Furthermore, \"a few\" only refers to two things, which can only be either the man's nose or friend's behaviour. Therefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\n### Context:\nThis sentence is the concluding remark of a quote that praises the man for his humour and wisdom.

Since the text specifically says we're looking for pantry.  We can rule out D and E because the text only says perishable food, indicating that it is a food which goes bad quickly, and it doesn't say this about jars or supermarkets.\n\nTherefore the only choices left to choose from which allow us to answer the question is B and C.

Hence, what you have to do is to choose the answer that does NOT fill in the blanks.\nThe choices are all similar and refer to sitting on a chair, or sitting down. However, there is one choice, \"sit down\". In this sentence, the man was denied the possibility of sitting on the chair. He could not sit down.\n\nHence, the right answer is \"sit down\". Choices B, C, D, and E cannot be the right answer as they refer to sitting down or sitting. The choice \"sit down\" has the specificity that the man actually wanted to sit down but was unable to in this situation. So, the answer is \"sit\" or \"sit down\".\n\nAnswer:\n>The man wanted so badly to take the bus but he could no longer stay standing on his feet because all the chairs were taken.\n\n### Input\n>In the movie, his friend wanted to marry and have a small dog, but the woman disagreed with what?

So A, B, and C are all incorrect options.\n5. There are two remaining options: delight, and contentment.\n6. Delight is too extreme for the situation, so D is not a choice.\n7.

We got three choices: horrible and ridicoulous price, the price the public wants and needs, and unbelievable and inattainable. Horrible and ridiculous are not appropriate since the chemist discovered a cure, not poison.\n2. The chemist announced that they have a cure. So the price will be a price that many people want.\n3.

Choices: 1. A: surprise 2. B: joy 3. C: happiness 4. D: pride 5. E: devotion\n\n### Response- The correct answer to the question is D: pride, which can be defined as feeling, being, or showing great respect for one's self and one's work. Of the choices given, pride seems to be the closest concept to the prompt. This is a reasonable assumption as the question asks for the correct answer which is  \"her eyes full of what emo...\" and the given choices are very general, such as \"her eyes full of emotions\". This makes the choices vague and not definitive, and thus, the correct answer is  D: pride.\n\n### Input 1:In all truthfulness, the problem wasn't nearly as serious this time.  The issue he had with his old boss was still what? Choices: A: bone of contention B: sticking point  C: matter D: sturdy foundation E: thorn in his side\n\n### Response : Although all choices are accurate to some extent, one choice stands out as especially valid for the question. The answer is C: matter. This is the answer because the given phrase \" In all truthfulness,...\" is very general. In addition, the question poses an interesting rhetoric device by implying \"The issue he had with his [...] was still matter X\" as the correct response based on the choices given. This sets an implicative tone and leaves the reader with a choice for the correct answer between the general choices, as all of them are reasonable. That being said, \"boss\" would be taken as person rather than an office job.", "answer": "D: pleasure"}

Blood is not usually spilt during baseball.\n2. Blood is not spilt during baseball, so the game is not soccer.\n3. Blood is not spilled during baseball, so the sport is not capillaries.  \n4. Blood is not usually wasted during baseball, so the activity is not ball, since the game does allow for the use of hands, at least in some aspects, namely holding the bat and playing with the balls.\n5. Blood is not usually lost during baseball, so the event is not animals, since the sporting event itself features no animals and animal blood is also excluded from the question.\n6. Blood is not normally shed during baseball, so the item is not body, which contradicts the original statement since we are dealing with blood, which is not usually spilt.  \n7. Thus, baseball is not soccer, and is not an animal.\n8. So it\u2019s a sporting activity that doesn\u2019t allow hands.\n9. The game we have left is baseball, which, in fact, is a sport, does not allow the use of hands, and doesn\u2019t feature animals. Thus, baseball is the correct choice.\n10. So blood isn\u2019t usually spilt during baseball, because in baseball you can\u2019t use your hands, therefore, you don\u2019t spill any blood when you\u2019re playing baseball; that\u2019s why you\u2019re not allowed to use your hands, so you don\u2019t get any blood on your hands when you play baseball.  \n11.

However, this exercise uses a cartoon character, so I'm going to say what the question specifically asks: comedy, dismemberment, or spinal injuries.\n\nDiving offa cliff is already dangerous. It's almost certain that the character will end up falling, resulting in the injuries or dismemberment listed above. Splats are more for something to jump on top of, since a cliff is very high up, and very far from where a cartoon character would generally be.\nIt's more likely that a cartoon character will get wet from falling, since cartoon characters are usually made of water, or splash a lot on the ground.\nThose are all silly outcomes that should never actually happen, so the question says it will end in comedic what? The answer is C: dismemberment because comedy and spinal injuries is an outcome that isn't really likely.\n\n### Response 2:\n\nAnswer: C, Dismemberment because Slaphead falls off a cliff during the cartoon to begin with. Getting wet is not a good enough of an answer because Slaphead would be dripping for awhile before he or she fell through a wall. Getting wet would not be a good response because the question specifically said a cartoon character and said Slaphead. Getting wet would not fit in as an answer since Slaphead is a cartoon.\n\nAnswer: Snaphead falls off of cliff, which is comedic. I don't know what splats means.\n\nAnswer: I understand the question and the comic. Slaphead or Snaphead does not always get wet. The cartoon Slaphead is very dry.\n\n### Input:: How does a mammal stay warm? By moving their arms and legs like what? Choices: A: Penguins B: Gorillas C: Horses D: Snakes E: Hummingbirds\n\nRationales: Since the question has said what a mammal does to stay warm, the question itself is implying that you will identify this from one of the following choices.\n\nThe correct answer: E: Hummingbird\n\n### Why? :The", "answer": "E: splats"}

{"text": "C: place money on counter\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe question says that some customers want things straight into their doorsteps and uses \"the\". This makes the customers into a collective. If it was the individual customer requesting, the personal pronoun \"his\" or \"her\" would need to be used. From these choices, we know that customers want things in their doorsteps. We understand that money is required to buy the things. However, we have to pick the one that matches these requirements. Of these choices, only choice C has both money + customers. This is not a coincidence. Merchants take money and provide their customers with their purchased goods. Money is a necessary condition. However, there are other items that fulfill the necessary conditions. For instance, choice D takes money and has more customers. This would be the opposite of satisfaction, though, so it's not correct. In choice A and E, the goods are \"straight to the doorsteps\". However, it does not talk about using money. Also, the choice B is not correct, since the money is used for the goods, but this is not the goods going to the doorstep. Therefore, the correct option is C: place money on the counter.\n\n### Input-Choices: 1. C: place money on table. 2. D: put money on the floor. 3. C and A; if you know the customer. 4. D. 5. B: Place money on table.\n\n### Exc: 1. C. D: the owner's table.\n\nTo answer this question, we must use our knowledge of the rules in English.

For example, if a friend and I are talking about the weather and my friend says, \"It's warm here.\", I can answer with, \"Yes, it's warm. It's about 80 degrees.\" or \"Yes, it' the warm right now, isn't it?\" In this example, I need to state my opinion, so I answer with the subject, I (person) am stating opinion, or the opinion that I am giving, but I don't need to say that I'm stating it.

{"text": "Choose D: carpet\n\n### Response Rationale: It is stated in the question that floors are being kept clean for holy purposes, this tells us that floors should be kept clean to be used as a place of worship.\n\n### The choice of choice is correct because it mentions a place in which people worship, thus being correct. \nThe choice of D: carpet is incorrect because it is not a holy place but rather a place to pray in.\n\n### Input is a sentence that ends with which the word you is capitalized.\n\n### Response is a correct choice for whether a sentence is capitalized.\n(If a sentence doesn't finish with which or who, do not capitalize it after the word.)\n\n### Response would be incorrect because you is not in the sentence if it is just asking \"Can you sing the song?\"\n\n### Input would be incorrect if it were just asking \"How will you travel home?\"\n\n### Incorrect Input would say \"Would you eat soup\" or \"Would you be angry\".\n\n### Correctly capitalized:  \nWhen a sentence ends with where, who, what, when, or why, the word you is capital.\n\n### Wrong:  Would you travel by car?\nRight:   Would you travel home by car?\n\n### WRONG:     Do you want to go to school today?\nRIGHT:     Do you want To go to School today?\n\n###  WRONG:  Is the doctor in today?\nRIGHT :  Is the doctor In today?", "answer": "E: synagogue"}

The question is asked in a general sense as to where the blowfish lives.\n2. We can determine by cross-referencing the answer choices with the context that the only choices that would apply are A and D.\n3. The question does not mention any specific details about the living arrangements of the fish.\n4. Therefore, \"a blowfish\" would not live in a pet shop or an apartment, these choices don't fit the context of the question.\n5. The choice E is \"the little mermaid\" which might be referring to a story by Hans Christian Andersen, but it cannot be the right answer for the fish market.\n6. The other three choices could refer to the location in the sense of an adjective, but they also would not be suitable for describing where a particular blowfish might live.\n7. The choice E would be impossible for a fish as it is unable to leave the water, and choices A and C would not apply to a fish, so the choice that fits the context best is B: fish market as it clearly indicates that the blowfish lives in a fish market. This is due to the choice wording and the options being adjectives.\n8. Therefore, if we apply these principles, the best answer is B: fish market.\n\nAnswer: B: fish market\n\n### Input:\"Anna was always on the verge of what?

{"text": "After eating dinner, the poor man felt sick.\n\n### Discussion and justification:\nChoices A: Indigestion could be a potential choice, but the question does not say that the man had indigestion; merely that after eating the dinner, he felt sick. Therefore, indigestion is not the correct choice.\n\nChoices B: Died does not answer the question; it is the logical conclusion that would happen if the man had eaten undercooked chicken, but the question is whether or not he felt ill. Therefore, died is not the right answer.\n\nChoices C: Illness does not answer the question. The question does not indicate that he felt ill, only that he felt sick. Furthermore, it does not imply that it would be an extended period of illness. Therefore, illness is not the correct answer.\n\nChoice D: Feel better addresses the feeling of sickness that the question is asking for. It does not indicate whether it was because he ate undercooked chicken; but the correct answer is one that does. This leads us to choose E: Throwing up. Throwing up is what you do when you eat undercooked food and feel sick. Therefore, throwing up is the correct answer.\nAnswer: E\n\n### Extra Practice:\n\n1.

Overpopulation is a type of population problem in which the number of existing human beings exceeds the carrying capacity of earth.  It is not explicitly stated in this sentence.  The answer choices provided are Birth, Presents, Propagation, and Fun, which are all about giving.

{"text": "I'm not sure, I'll need to look up dictionary definitions for these terms.\n\n### Response 2:\nThe term \"hole\" is probably not a good choice for the blank, because that word typically refers to a circular opening as opposed to a long vertical or horizontal crevice. A term related to \"hole\" instead would be \"pit\". Also, \"plain\" is a flat, open area without elevations or obstacles. In its simplest form, a plain could be an overwhelmingly expansive flat land like the Great Plains to the Midwest. There are also plateaus, grasslands, badlands, and other more complex types of plains. But we're looking for something more specific than a plain; this may be where mountains come into play. In this case, perhaps a \"canyon\". Canyon is a vertical trench, and could be formed by the process of erosion.\nCanyon could also be a form of a \"gorge\", which is another type of trench, but it doesn't have to be vertical, and also doesn't technically have to be formed by erosion. The term \"canyon\" is better used in the western part of the globe, and if it wasn't already taken in this question, and \"gorge\" is better suited for the eastern part. The other main form of these \"trenches\" or openings is a \"gulf\". This is an inlet off a sea or ocean, but this could also be referring to a hole in the ground.\nThis leaves us with \"mountain\". This is what we're trying to get to in the first place, with the blank being the \"hole\" in the plain. A mountain is a natural elevation, or hill. There are mountains that are small, but generally they're much taller than what would be considered a hill. There are also volcanoes that are shaped like mountains, but are actually cones.\nIf this particular mountain is larger than an average mountain, it could be labeled as a \"range\", such as the Appalachian Mountains or Alps.\n\nBut as far as what could be labeled a \"range\", these three terms can be interchanged as noun adjectives.

Learning from the past is related to seeing artifacts, as they can often provide a valuable insight into a historical perspective.\n4.

{"text": "This is a fill-in-the-blanks sentence correction type of question. It expects that you will write an appropriate complete sentence as the response. \n\nWhenever you are asked a question that is not a full sentence (i.e. not a question at the beginning), you should convert it into its proper sentence form when responding. \n\nThis gives your response a more natural feel and also provides an opportunity for you to show your ability in identifying the intended meaning and properly applying it in the language.\n\nTo begin, you should consider the logical flow of the question. When I read this question, I think that it is implying that Billy left home because he did not want to stay where his parents were fighting, therefore, \"at home\" does not seem to make a lot of sense. \n\n### Demand:\nTo begin, you have to choose one of the answer choices that makes good sense and is supported by the text, which is, \"away\". When I read this question I think \"away\" is an appropriate response because the options other than \"away\" do not make any sense in this context. For example, \"at home\" contradicts the intended meaning.\n\n### Justification:\nEven though the question could have stated \"Home\" instead, that is not why I chose \"away\". I chose \"away\" because in that context, I believe that Billy's parents were fighting and that Billy might have gotten in the middle of fight and this led to his parents fighting him out. \n\n## Rationale:\nThe only option \"away\" seems to be fitting in the context because \"away\" suggests that Billy's parents might have fighting with him, which makes Billy think that going away would be a better choice than staying home at the same time where his parents are arguing. Additionally, the other options can be eliminated by going through all six logical choices. \n\n## Solution:\n\n\n\n### Rationale 1:\n\"Billy went away because\" means \"Because Billy went away.\"  Billy went away because he wanted to avoid his parents' fight. \n\n## #2:Demand:\nWhen you see the phrase \"'cause' + present participle clause\" you should read the clause carefully to learn about the action that caused the result.\n\nThe present participle clause in this question is \"went away\",", "answer": "C: at home"}

Since Heather is usually right, the question is asking why she might be wrong about when her book is due since it's so unusual for her to be in that situation.\n2. The options provided are wrong, but this refers to being wrong in a way that is not typical.\n3. Therefore the answer is C, forgetful, which means that sometimes Heather forgets things.\n4. Because forgetful is a word that fits with a person who can be wrong, careless is an option that would not make sense because that is not a fitting word.\n5.

Wrong would not make sense as it's too vague and not a choice that can be easily deduced from the given answers.\n7. Wrongly is not correct since the question doesn't ask about Heather being wrong, it asks about Heather being wrongly. In this case, \"wanted to be\" is the wrongly part.

{"text": "Choice:  D: huge\n\n### Demostration\n\nDemonstration: Huge could be appropriate for a building that is very tall or wide, but the word also suggests that it can be both, especially in this context. Hence, it is reasonable that huge could describe an Empire State building. In this case, huge means \"tall\".\n\n\n### Response 1:\n\n[A: small](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65913061/how-can-buildings-like-the-empire-state-building-be-described)\n\n### Response2:\n\n[B: underground](https://stackoverflow. com/questions/65786662/how-can-all-languages-of-the-world-be-translated)\n\n### Detailed:\nThe question is asking how the Empire State building can be described. \"Small\" is not a possibility as the Empire State building is relatively big, so \"small\" will be dismissed. Looking at the remaining choices, \"underground\" would suggest that the building is below the surface of the land, which may be interpreted as being not visible above the surface of the land. In this sense, the Empire State building isn't underground because it is visible and the second largest building in the world. \"High\" is also interpreted as something that is relatively far above the surface and a more appropriate use of the word might have described a building that isn't too big while being tall. However, tall would work in this context based on the other details provided. \"Huge\" represents something that is gigantic or really big, and it is relevant in this case because the Empire State building is the second largest building in world. Hence, the word \"huge\" is the appropriate one to describe the Empire State building.\n\n\n---", "answer": "E: tall"}

{"text": "I disagree with her that an area is more likely to be struck by natural disasters than its neighboring areas.\n\n### Rationales:  1. The question mentions that there was an article written about how there's been a rise in accidents in the area. The question does not mention where this \"area\" is located, but only suggests that there has been an increase in the incidence of accidents in an area over another.\n2. The question then mentions that the lady is freaking out about the news article while her husband is calm.\n3. Then the husband responds to the article by stating that accidents happen anytime, anywhere. This implies that accidents are not location-based.\n4. The person that wrote the article would be arguing that accidents occur specifically as the result of a lack of precautionary measures being enforced, based on the information he had gathered that has caused an increase in accidents resulting in injury.\n5. Therefore, the best response is D: happen anywhere because it addresses where accidents can occur, which is anywhere. Thus D is the best response.\n6. Thus, the best response is C: happen anywhere. Then the second response would be C: hurt people. \nGrammar: The response is correct because it addresses some of the points indicated in the question- the second sentence is correct because it's logical, in that the woman would be getting worked up about the topic if she were taking it as true.\n7. Thus, A: happen to people is a good follow up response because the lady was worried about it happening to her, so the person is indicating to her that people can be hurt from accidents.\n8. The next second sentence may not have the correct spelling of \"precautionary measure\" because it is a term from another article that is a good follow up to address the issue.\n9. Thus, another correct follow up to address the precautionary measures required to avoid an accident occurring would be E: happen anywhere. Also, the correct spelling should have been \"preceding\", as in: The preceding article was focused on accidents due to negligent safety measures.  \n\n\n### Revised Response: I also disagree with her that only her area is more likely to have accidents. Instead, I would point to her neighboring community as being just as likely.", "answer": "E: happen anywhere"}

We were looking to renovate and expand our living space. By getting an architect on the project, and doing some extensive research on our part, we were able to design a structure with modern conveniences that would be visually pleasing and functional. We decided to use wood, metal, and glass panels to construct the walls, floors, and roofs of our home. To create a more spacious appearance, we wanted to make the space of our ceiling high enough, and for the ceilings to be higher than the walls so that we did not feel cramped into our home. As for our bathroom, we opted to use glass panels to create an airy and spacious feeling by giving the impression that one is bathing in an open space.

They are often considered to be a classic or timeless.\n\nPolitical works are a type of written works that represent a form of work concerning the study of politics and political behavior, and their relationship to politics as it is practiced in particular systems and societies.\n\n### Question:How can you determine if something is true?

If that was the case, the question wouldn't make sense to begin with, as it wouldn't make them feel the same thing.\n\nOption E, is the right answer to this question because we all feel different, this statement is in context to those different feelings feeling the same way.\n\nAnswer: E: Everyone is different\n\nInput: The people in the village have a great many things to be happy about, but they can't help themselves from being discontent.

The context is \"they said at the end of the day you should have done what\"\n2. The correct answer will most likely be the sentence that comes after \"did\".\n3.

Choices of quitting, working again, being honest and acting up are not the correct answer, since they make no sense in regards with being honest in the restaurant.\n5. Quit was a choice that could be suggested as the sentence after \"did\", but the speaker's reason of leaving the restaurant doesn't make sense to the phrase that the restaurant owner had told him/ her to quit.\n6.

To do this, the model should read the sentence, identify the question, scan for a direct answer, and then answer it. \nTherefore, for this task, we need the MLNet to first read the question for which it would be answering, and then it should scan the input for the answer(s) it is looking for. \nBecause questions are often a long time after the sentence, we want the model to be able to parse the entire sentence prior to the answer, rather than just the end. Therefore, the input to this task is passed in such a way that the model receives the entire sentence, and is able to identify and answer the question. \nBecause we are using the MLNet Model, we need a `context_size` (this is the number of context tokens around the mask token).  This means that we have to ensure that there are enough tokens (words) before and after the input in order to find the appropriate question. \nThe maximum `context_size` for the model is 6, so we want 1-2 tokens before the input, but 1-2 tokens after the input. \n\nIf you are still not sure why exactly the first two lines are needed (because the model still accepts these tokens as input), you can try to remove those and see what happens. \n\n### Explanation of example\n\nThe answer to this specific question is \"D: Habitat\" \n\nBecause habitats are a type of indigenous places where animals can be found, this would be the correct answer. \n\nThis example also illustrates the usefulness of the first two lines of text (and tokenization), because if they were removed during model training or during the prediction step, the answer would not be \"Habitat\", it would instead be \"A: India\".", "answer": "E: rain forest"}

Repeat the process as indicated.\n\n### Answer:\n\nThe first part of the process is simple. The word \"joy\" was mentioned in the context of joy. That means that \"joy\" is the correct word to use as the answer choice. This part of the process is completed and done.\nThe next part of the process requires us to ask the question: \"What caused this woman to feel great joy.\" The text of our question states that despite the joy, there was still something bad that occurred. This gives us the context to determine that some kind of challenge or problem occurred.\nThe woman experienced a bad time because despite the joy she also experienced misery. Misery is the correct word to fill in answer choice B.\nThe next question in this process asks: \"How did this experience cause the bad time?\"\nThis next statement of how the bad time occurred is the correct answer because the bad time didn't just happen by itself. As the text states, \"Despite all of the great joy experienced...\" The problem wasn't present at the time she experienced the great joy.\nThe bad time occurred because her experience of great joy was interrupted by her experiencing something bad.\nThe most appropriate choice to use for an answer is the word \"interrupted\" because it answers the question of how the misery caused by experiencing a bad time that it interrupted the great joy.\nIf the misery did not interrupt the great joy, then the misery would not have had caused a bad time to experience.\n\n### Solution to the next Question:\n\nIn line 1 of the question, the word phrase \"sadness was experienced by the woman,\" therefore it is not appropriate to use it as an option in the answer choice.\nBecause the word \"experienced\" was used in the context of lines 1 and 2, it is the only choice appropriate to use in an answer to the question.\nTherefore the only option for the answer in this question is the choice: \"experienced\".\n\n### Solution for the next Question:\nThe answer to the next question is choice \"C\": \"bad time\" because it is the only answer that can be used to complete the sentence and the question", "answer": "C: bad time"}

When observing the task, we need to observe all the keywords in the task. In this task they are \"mind\" and \"sleeping\". We can also perform deduction by looking at the structure of the task which is more than often asking us to choose the correct answer. In this task, we must make a choice based on the question type \"What is the key task\", which is why we must first understand the keyword in the task. \n- Last but not least, we need to employ interpretation skills to analyze the question and the provided keywords in relation to our reading and writing skills in order to produce a response that is a logical and complete answer to the specific task.\n\n### Reflection \n\n- I learned that we must be very careful in reading a task and question.

The first is that the man expected to be reprimander, meaning that doing the work will result in him receiving criticism from his supervisor.\n8.

This sense could most easily apply to a situation in which an employee is applying for a better job.

So it could mean \"the most beautiful girl [in a field].\"  However, since this is an idiom, the context of the question requires you to use common context of this phrase, which is that it is used to describe the best thing of whatever is said.  So the phrase doesn't mean \"the best girl in [a field],\" but instead means \"the best [of] whatever [this is].\"  The other choices do not directly describe this idiom but rather are not idioms, while \"A. best of the [most] best\" fits perfectly as a replacement.\n\n### Input\uff1aI told our CEO that we had to fix our what before making a larger announcement?

{"text": "The correct response is D: opera.\n\n### Rationales:\n#### Context:\n1. People are looking because they're at a baseball game.  There are people with binoculars and they're looking into the distance.\n2. They would be looking at some things that are going through a period of action, but are actually aren't moving at the time, these things are called the \"balls\" or \"baseballs\"; some baseball players are batting as well.\n3. Balls can move, but they aren't moving in this game because there aren't any \"molecules\" or atoms moving around.\n4. So people would be looking into the distance while also focusing on the game that would be going on.\n\n#### Process:\n1. The question is not asking about an explicit detailing of the situation, but it is asking about a \"something\" which could be anything that has movement.\n2. The key is to identify the one item that has movement but isn't moving in the given setting.\n3. The given item \"ball\" doesn't have movement because it is sitting on the surface of the earth and it is stationary, so \"ball\" and \"batting\" are not the answer.\n4. The next answer choice that has a moving \"thing\" but no movement is \"football stadium\" which has many footballs moving around; however, they are moving because people were playing with them.\n5. Thus, \"something\" can only be \"an opera\" because an \"orchestra\" which is the group of musicians on stage can be considered as a \"thing\" that has motion.\n6. But the orchestra at a baseball game isn't moving.\n7. However, the ballerinas who perform in an opera are \"dancing\" and that is moving; but the ballet that is being performed is stationary.\n8. So the phrase \"at some things which can move\" actually refers to orchestra- not the operatic ballerina.\n9. Therefore, the correct answer is D: opera because the \"ball\"/ballerina is moving, but the opera on stage is not moving; thus meaning it is the correct answer.\n\n### Notes:\n\n1.

{"text": "It is stated in the passage that I will be going to the shopping malls. The shopping malls are a place where people come to shop for things.

Choices: 1: what the bank loaned you; 2: what you paid for the car; 3: how long it took to build; 4: how much money they could get out of a sale; 5: what you thought you could pay\nRationales: The sentence makes us think the car cost less than average. What the bank loaned you is not important, there's no relation between it and how much they could get out of selling the car or the length of time they took to build it. Choice 1 could be acceptable if both items were the same, however they are only one option. Choice 2: what you bought the car for could also be an acceptable match, however it would be if someone wanted to spend more and it was not the same price for everyone. Choice 3: how long they took to build, however we do not know how long they actually took to build the car, therefore this cannot be the option. Choice 4: how much the bank thought they could get if they sold it is not what you paid for the vehicle. Therefore, only the last option, what you thought you could afford can give us the answer to the question, and choice 5: what you could afford is the correct answer.\n\n### Answer: 5: what I could afford\n\n### Input He is the oldest sibling and the most reliable; he's our very own Santa Claus.

Learning can contribute to acquiring knowledge (the fact that someone learns does not mean he or she would definitely gain knowledge): that is something implied by the second definition of \"learn\", which is \"to acquire (knowledge or skill), by study or experience.\"\n2. Intelligence, however, is something innate that one is born with.

The question can be paraphrased as:\nChoices C and D are incorrect because \"certificate of origin\" should be capitalized if it were part of a brand. \n\n2.

Choices:  A. careless B. busy C. preoccupied D. oblivious E. thoughtless\nRationales:1. The question is using the word \u201cnever.\u201d A man never stopped to get important mail. This means that if the man had stopped to get his mail, he would not never had never sent it.\n2. The question states that the man was a \u201cbusybody.\u201d This means that he was occupied with lots of things.\n3. He was too busy to stop even for some important mail.\n4. Choices B, C and D mean something else. The question is asking about not stopping to get important mail.  So the correct answer is \u201cbusybody.\u201d The man was busy body all the time but he was not oblivious or preoccupied.\n5. \u201cBusybody\u201d means that the man was too busy to complete his work assignments and to read or listen to what other people say.

Choices: A: dinner B: lunch C: breakfast D: brunch E: supper\nRationales:1. The question is a sentence stem, \"There was always food on the...\" It is asking about our mother's cooking.\n2. \"Food on the table\" refers to any food, including \"dinner\" \"lunch\" or \"breakfast\", and any related variation of what has been served in the past at various times of the day.\n3. It's highly unlikely that a child would say \"mother could also fix 'dinner'\" as the word \"dinner\" itself is already part of the stem.\n4. This is because the answer to this question would more likely be about what our mother could do in terms of preparing food for \"brunch\", \"breakfast in bed\", \"supper\", et cetera.\n5. \"Brunch\" makes sense, but is not the correct answer, as \"brunch\" is more of a term used in the U.S.\n6. It's not correct to say our mother could prepare \"breakfast in bed\" because \"breakfast in bed means something different.\n7. Thus, it must be something like supper or evening \"supper\" as such a term makes sense in conjunction with the stem as a whole and there is no word that is ambiguous or vague in any way as part of this stem.\n8.

Shelf is a piece of furniture that holds items and organizes them.\n\n### Why B is correct:\n1. Dave put his beer where it would be accessible. Refrigerator is a place to keep cold items, beer would be accessible in the refrigerator.\n2. Closet may be a place that Dave puts his beer, but as the rest of the sentence says it will be off the floor so the beer will not be reachable.\n3. Can suggests that Dave placed a can of beer, but we are not told for sure if the beer is in a can, a bottle, or a mug. Additionally, Can is not something that Dave could put \"on\", which is what it was asked to be placed \"on\". Furthermore, placing anything that was in the can to a shelf is not a possibility, because the can would not just be laying on the shelf. So, Can is not the correct word choice.\n4. Shelf is the correct answer.\n5.

{"text": "The options I've been given here, while generally appropriate, don't describe what the term would be to describe a person who gifts often. I think if you read'shop for' and you know the full phrase, which is 'to go shopping for something,' then you'd think of a person who has money to spend and makes purchases in a retail store, which would be 'to shop for it.' Otherwise,'shop for' does not make sense as a possible term to describe a person who buys gifts for other people.\n\n### Answer: The correct answer is D, \"have money.\" This answer is likely because the question asked, if you buy gifts, what would you be called? The phrase \"you'd be called\" means to describe a person based on one of the available answer phrases. If the question asked, \"what phrase is defined by\" then generous, gift buyer, etc. could have been the correct answer, but it obviously doesn't matter what the question asks, since the question wording in this case does not make sense at all. The only option which would make you a \"gift buyer\" is to \"have money\" because that is what you require in order to be able to buy gifts, and money is not a good or a bad thing, and even if someone has no money to buy gifts, it does not stop them from being generous or anything else they could be called.

If we remove the sentence that has incomplete syntax, we are left with \"will only\" and nothing else.

When do you get the perfect life? It can only be achieved after death; once a person passes away. Above all, one can never know if what is going on around him/ her is a perfect life.

Choices B, C, and D are all similar - going downtown and bottoming out both suggest the customer experienced something unpleasant at the dealership. I think that it is not obvious which one would be most fitting, but since choice C has \"out\" (and the rest of the sentence \"out suddenly\") and choice D has \"out\" (downtown is synonymous with \"out\" in this context), I am leaning towards choice D (and the word scream).

Hence, C cannot be used.\n\nD cannot be used as the text mentions that someone who is doing everything to try to avoid a fight is not necessarily a coward.\nE can be used because it talks about that when you look at a person and see that they are not afraid of fighting and engaging in a scuffle, you can tell that a man is a brawler and maybe a coward.\nHence, E can be used.\n\n**Answer:** E.

{"text": "D, E\n\n### Rationale 1:\n  The question wants to know how someone would feel AFTER going for a run, not how they would feel after the run, as in the options choice B (sore) and choice C (tired).\n  - It's easy to misconstrue what the question is asking. Therefore, the best answer choice is one that describes what happens after the run, and not during the run.\n\n### Rationales:\nRationale 2:\n  The options choices A through E each have words describing how someone would feel after a run.\n\n  Choice A is \u2018working out\u2019. This word refers to activities that are done regularly and not necessary as a result of running. After a run someone might feel worked out, but they wouldn\u2019t feel this way directly after having recently finished running.\n\n  Choices B and C: \n    Choice B, sore, is a synonym of choice C, tired. A person will not feel \u201ctired\u201d during their running, they will only feel as such after they have finished and may rest.\n\n  Hence, choice D, satisfaction, remains.\n\nRationale 3:\n\nChoice D, satisfaction, is a vague term and doesn\u2019t specify any type of emoting a person would feel afterwards from running. \n\nChoices E, falling down, is not an emotion, it describes a physical outcome of running.\n\nThus, choice C, tired, should be eliminated.\n\nRationale:\n\nChoice E can be eliminated as it is not an emotion.\n\nRationale\nAll of the other options are emotions, as the question is directly asking how someone would feel \u201cafter\u201d running.\n\nRationale for Answer- D\n\nThe correct answer is choice D, because it is specific and describes what the question is asking for.\n\n### Input;What is the best way to prevent getting sick?

It's not a word commonly used and it might leave a person in confusion, so it might be unclear what it means exactly for a device to be compact.\nFor instance, this response was written in an attempt to answer the question correctly, but it was likely that the writer of the question intended for it to be \"packaged\" instead of \"bound\".\n\n\n```\nCertainly the question leaves a bit of confusion as to what exactly is meant by a \"compact\", but it is evident that the meaning is to hold things tightly together so that they won't fall apart, hence the question asks what you use to do that.\n```\n\n\nWhat is the best answer to this question, in your opinion? Do you agree with the answer that one of the writers proposed to this question?\n\n```\nD:  It seems like a pretty good choice would be the \"compact\" one, but there isn't any clear indication as to why the other options might not be good choices.\n\nE: If someone meant to write \"packaged\" then that choice might be the best, but it's not as clear that it would be the answer to the question that was asked.\n\nB: packaged is the best choice because if you meant to ask what device would most conveniently hold things together, \"packaged\" fits perfectly with that intention because it means that it has been prepared to hold things like that.\n\nA: tightening doesn't make sense in this context because papers aren't likely to be used in such a way that their being crumpled is a serious problem and so they would need to be \"tightened\". It seems like the question is about whether loose papers would get \"tied up\" enough to be kept in order.\n\nC: binding the papers does not necessarily mean holding them together in a proper way, it just means that they can be bound together. Therefore it doesn't answer the question about holding loose papers together.\n\nD: faithful is also not the correct answer here because it implies that the papers would be kept", "answer": "C: bound"}

It was a happy place, and we really enjoyed life there.  My fondest memories from my childhood are those days at home in our apartment.  I was young and my brother was much younger, so I'd spend a lot of time with my mom and dad, and with my brother when I could get away.  Although we were poor, we had enough space to be content, and we never felt cramped.  We ate many meals there, did our homework there, and occasionally got a few good meals outside.  We played games both indoors and outdoors, and we were always happy as a family.

Similarly, a mall is likely a place to go to do shopping and not to eat.\n4. Also, a business sector is too general as it describes a larger area rather than a restaurant.\n5.

{"text": "Given the choices, the correct answer is B: head.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question is essentially asking for a type of person or category of people who typically get sick.\n\nA hospital is a place that treats sick people, so an answer of hospital is not appropriate as it doesn't identify or indicate a type of person.\n\nFurthermore, a head could be an individual in a population of people, but it doesn't show why he/she contracts illness.\n\nA sick person could also be a category of persons and could also get illness, yet it is not the most comprehensive answer. Moreover, being sick would not indicate why he/she is susceptible to illness.\n\nAn elderly person may also get sick more often or be more vulnerable to illness as compared to the other categories, yet it indicates only that an older individual can get sick, yet doesn't explain why.\n\nLastly, a doctor\u2019s office is a place that treates sick people, so it's a place where a sick person could receive treatment rather than be ill. Therefore, an answer of doctor's office is not appropriate as it does not indicate a type of sick person.\n\nTherefore, the only suitable answer would be B: heads, which are individuals.\n\nAnswer: B: heads\n\n### Inputs:What is a reason why some students are very poor?

{"text": "\"Ben was in a homeless shelter for 8 years\" is the correct answer.\n\n### Motivation:\nThe first clue that we received was that Ben was \"an alcoholic\". This means that he had a problem in drinking and that he was addicted to drinking alcohol. As an alcoholic he probably needed alcohol in order to function properly, thus we can say that Ben was homeless. He didn't have any place to go or a home so he found himself living in a homeless shelter.\nWe don't know if the accident was caused by Ben himself or it was done by an external factor. This doesn't change the fact that Ben will probably go to jail at the end.\n\nThe only possible choice could be \"Homeless shelter\" because it is the only place where we can imagine a person to spend a lot more time. Also, this would give us an answer that doesn't require us to guess that he is an alcoholic. In the context of this question, the answer \"homeless shelter\" is the easiest pick.\n\n### Answer:\nInput:What could have caused that? Choices: A: A computer B: A computer system C: Both A & B D: A computer system E: A computer B: Both A & B C: Both A & E D: Both B & C E: Both C & D \n\nMotivation:The correct answer is: Choices: A & B C & D or E\n\n### Response 1:\nAnswers 1: Choices: A : both A & B\n\nAnswer 2: \n\n### Answer 2:\n\"What could have caused that?\" is a very ambiguous question.

The Bank of England had been created earlier, but England didn't have anything like our Federal Reserve System. By contrast, the United States has been an active economic power since around 1776, when most of its thirteen original states had either declared independence or were engaged in revolt against their British colonial rulers. After the Civil War, the country became even more active; indeed, its population doubled between 1840 and 1870\u2014and continued to grow at an even faster rate in the decades that followed. At the close of World War I in 1918, the United States was ranked fourth among the world's industrial nations in terms of gross national product; in 1948 it would reach first place, where it has remained ever since.\n\nBy 1620, about 500 English Puritans (Pilgrims) had gathered on the north shore of the Massachusetts Bay, to which they had recently been granted charter rights.

The question is whether she likes to listen to others, while she prefers to go her own way.\n2. We can identify listen from the context and choose B for the first part of the question.\n3.

To determine the best decision, the wording of the question needs to be considered:\n\t2.1. The wording \"build\" suggests that it is possible for the new store to be built.\n\t2.2. Therefore, since the store can be built it is necessary to determine where would be the best location to build it to maximize sales:\n\t2.3. Choice A, \"idaho\" suggests being built in a place where sales will not be maximized, and\n\t2.4. Choice B, \"shopping mall\" indicates that it is already in existence which means there would be no need to build it there to maximize sales.\n\t2.5. Choice C, \"big city\" indicates building the store there would also not maximize sales because there are already plenty of places where they can be bought there so it would not be necessary to open a new one.\n\t2.6. Choice D, \"in town\", is also an option for where to build it, however the wording \"in town\" is not specific.\n\t2.7. Choice E, \"new york\" is again an option, however this is a city with so many purchasing opportunities it would not be necessary nor prudent to open a new store there.\n3. Therefore when the other choices are all considered, the best location is Choice D: in town, since this is a place that might not have very many options for purchasing items the customer wants and the store would definitely offer many more buying opportunities than the customer is already able to experience.\n4.

{"text": "### Rationales:\n1. The choice \"get drunk\" is a clear indicator of inappropriate or irrelevant use of the pronoun \"they\". There are multiple reasons why someone might go to a party and not drink alcohol, so \"get drunk\" doesn't adequately explain why Jimmy wouldn't like going to a party.\n2. \"Getting drunk\" and \"having fun\" are both examples of things people do at parties, but as before, they're not specific to what \"they\" did in the question, so \"having fun\" would not be a suitable replacement of \"what they did\".\n3. \"Meet new people\" implies that the party wasn't focused on any particular interest or activity, or that the people in it were not the same people he usually interacted with, so this is not a logical replacement for \"what they did\". \n4. \"Dance\" would also be an example of something one might do at a party, but this doesn't help the reader understand why Jimmy would not like attending the party. \n5. So the correct replacement is \"have fun\".\n\n### Outcome:\nAn unfortunate grammatical error in the sentence has altered the meaning of the sentence. Choosing \"have fun\" instead of \"what they did\" helps restore the intended meaning of the sentence.\n\n### Next Step:\nReread the sentence, and find two or more places where you could improve the original sentence.\n\n## Input:The girl wasn't sure of her answer because she hadn't done the homework.

{"text": "Having examined the various choices, it is evident that C is correct. A is incorrect because it would not be considered as a disorder and has no bearing on the situation.  B is incorrect because the situation revolves around a man who was obsessively washing his hands with no apparent cause for doing so. He did this so much that it even led to a medical issue. Furthermore, it was a disorder that was described earlier in the chapter that this obsession of washing hands had gone excessive beyond good sense, and this is the crux of the questions. Thus, the only correct choice is C: Obsessively washing hands is a disorder.   Hint: The obsession was to use soap excessively to wash oneself.\nAnswer: C: Obsessive washing is disorder \n\n### Input:(The boy) was extremely excited to see the train pulling up to the station. However, he was equally what? Choices: A: anxious B: calm C: impatient D: surprised E: eager\nRationales:1. The questions asks what the boy (who had been extremely excited) was doing at the same time.\n2. The various options describe feelings.\n3. Anxiety describes the feeling of being worried about something.\n4. However anxiety is not necessarily experienced with excitement.\n5. More so, it's unclear if the boy was worried or nervous in regards to the train.\n6. Calmness would not be the right answer as the boy was excited to see the train, so it makes no sense to be calm at that time.\n7. Impatience would not be the correct answer either. He was anticipating to see the train, therefore not being impatient.\n8. Surprise is rejected. Though he was excited, surprise would not be the correct response to that state of mind.\n9. Eagerness, on the other hand, is the appropriate choice because it indicates the feeling to look forward to, and excitement is essentially the same thing, but more extreme. Therefore the best response is eagerness.\n10. A is not eagerness, eagerness is the feeling of wanting or being eager to do something, while anxiousness is more of an anxious emotion.\n11. Likewise, b, c and e would not have been appropriate responses", "answer": "B: irritation"}

Cities are places with roofs and people. People live on cities, so cities are known to always have people. This means that, since people live on cities, cities are known to always be true.

If he \"pushes for more orthodox behavior\" he may be pushing for more conservative behavior.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question is about the behavior of the priest.  Is he trying to be more liberal, which is the opposite of orthodoxy, or is he trying to be more orthodox?\n2. The word \"orthodox\" is a general term that has many possible uses. It could refer to any behavior that is not considered unorthodox (conservative), so the question does not provide enough information regarding which behavior is being referred to and which choice may be appropriate.\n\n### Input : What does Nicole make from baking bread regularly? Choices: 1. She has gained 100 pounds of weight 2. She earns $8 each hour 3. She saves $36 weekly 4. She has $120 in her bank account 5. She wins a lottery of $140,000\n\n### Response\nAnswer: Choice 3. She saves 36$ each weekly. \n\n### Rationale: \n\n1. The question explicitly asks what Nicole has earned from baking bread regularly.\n2. This implies she has done so for some time, so presumably she has been saving at least some amount of money as a result.\n3.

Paragraph 2: Write an essay about why Homeric epics are still read and appreciated today.\n3. Paragraph 3: Write an essay showing how the Hindus perceive the gods.\n4. Paragraph 4: Write an essay describing the origin of the Sermon on the Mount.\n5. Paragraph 5: Write an essay comparing Aristotle's view of slavery to those of earlier thinkers and to slavery as it exists in the United States today.\n\n### Output:\nThis essay is about Homer and his epics. Homer was a Greek poet, who lived in the 8th century B.C.E. He is famous for his epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey. The Iliad describes the events that took place at the end of the Trojan War, but the narrative really focuses on the character of Achilles. The Odyssey describes Odysseus' ten year journey back to his home island of Ithaca after the war. He is the main character. The stories are full of exciting adventure and drama. The reason people still read Homer today is because it's entertaining, exciting, and well crafted. There's always something happening to keep the reader interested.

{"text": "My guess as to answer is: E. A tunnel.\n\n### Why? \n\nI feel that this might be possible.\n\n1. The air would be a problem if you were to fly into space and try to measure the amount of oxygen in the air.\n2. Earth can handle a lot of oxygen, and so could space, so that eliminates A and B, since they don't contain any.\n3. C has a lot of oxygen also, but it is mainly a gas, and there would be no way to measure it all in one container.\n4. D doesn't really work either. There is no space to contain all the air.\n5. Therefore, I guess we have to go with the tunnel. We know that the question says that oxygen would be measure in space. When it comes to how much there is in space there is a small percentage of it that is found in a tunnel on the moon, and so this is why I believe we would travel to a tunnel to measure how much oxygen there would be.\n\n### Rationale: \nThis is how I think I would approach answering the question.\n\n\n\nThe question is asking if I have to keep track or monitor how much oxygen there are and where am I.\n\nThe choices are: air, water, earth and space shuttle.\n\nI would have to exclude the space shuttle as it flies within the atmosphere of earth and therefore contains a lot of oxygen.\n\nNext, I would look at Earth because it only has a small amount of oxygen in comparison to the amount in the air.\n\nNext, air is out as it too is a limited resource even if it has a lot of oxygein and it is also in an atmosphere.\n\nSo, this leaves me with water, but it only has a portion of the amount there is in earth atmosphere.\n\nSo next I need to rule out water and earth.\n\nI believe the next choice would be either A, B or C in which A would be space. I think that because there is way more oxygen in space, and that I would travel in a space shuttle to measure it.\n\nLastly, I believe that D would either be C or A, I believe this because of the previous reasoning.

Choices: (A) The front A (B) The way in (C) My way out D) The way around\nRationales: (A) There are probably many examples of waiting lines that were in front of you but you had to continue to the back. Hence, the phrase \"I had to go through the back\" does not reflect this idea accurately. Additionally, \"the back\" does not mean that you had to go through the exact \"back\".\n(B) Similarly, saying \"I had to go by way in\" does not mean you had to physically go through some obstacle to get to the line. In fact, you probably would just get in the line as you normally would.\n(C) The phrase \"I had to get out my way\" does not describe getting through the line. It usually refers to getting away from the crowd and finding a better entrance or exit point.\n(D) The phrase \"I made it my way around\" would usually describe some method of moving around the people and getting around the obstacle to get past it.\n(E) So, the only choice that makes sense is the one where there was something that would keep you from getting in line the normal way, so the answer is D: way around.\nAnswer: (D): way around\n\nInput: If you're in Paris where do you have to visit?

Choices: A: head B: face C: groin D: butt E: throat\n\n### Rationales\n1. The question is, which organ was hit? A, B, and C are options.\n1.  A, B, and F are all body systems, but they aren't all the same thing.\n2.  B: Face- Face is a body part where the brain and other organs can be found.\n2.  A: Head- A body part is not hit, its organs are.\n2.  Butt: Groin: Not any organs.\n2.  So only answer D and E are left.\n3.  D: Butt= Not an option.\n4.  E: Throat= The best answer.\n\n### Response\nResponse:E: Throat\n\n\n### Input (Demonstration): \nThe man in the hospital bed told of having been shot in the groin.  It took him months to fully recover.  What body system was not 100 percent corrected until the 10 weeks after? Choices:  The man had been shot in the  A: brain B: lungs C: groin D. liver E. throat \n\n### Answer: Brain\n\n### Output (Rationale): \nThere are many different body systems.  The brain is not one that can be directly hit by an object.  The throat and the lungs are other options.  Only two are being shot at.  So one can be excluded.  If this was a test, you can't eliminate.\n\n### Answer (Demonstration)\nChoice C: Groin- body parts that can be hit\nChoice B: Lungs- body systems that can be hit", "answer": "B: center"}
{"text": "1. Choice C, 'anthology' does not make sense in the context given. TV shows are not anthologies and do not often have several different themes which would make sense in this scenario, therefore, it cannot be used as the answer.\n2. Choice D,'state park' also does not refer to a ranger or gardener, so it cannot be used as an answer.\n3. Choices B and E are the two most likely choices, but if they were used as answers, they would also be incorrect.\n4. Choices A and E refer to two different places, so it is not possible to use one choice as the answer.\n5. Therefore, the answer must be choice B, which is 'countryside'. This is because the sentences refer to two separate settings, and 'countrysides' is a setting in which both rangers and gardener may thrive or live in.\n\n### Input:\"I can't believe how easy it is to open this lock.

{"text": "D: house\n\n### Rationale:\nThe word vintage is often used to describe a product of a high quality or having a certain classic or timeless style. Vintage also refers to a grape harvest, or the year the grape was harvested, in which case we can assume that only grapes would be described as vintage if light sources were being described as vintage.\n\n### Rationales: \n\n1. Vintage is more associated with things like wine or cars that are specifically classified based on their years of manufacturing.\n2. A light bulb is not necessarily an object of antiquity or of high or valuable quality in all instances.\n3. So it is more likely that the harvest years of wine grapes would have some relevance or bearing on a light source than anything else.\n4. The other answers would need some adjustment to align with the theme of vintage, and none are as clear as the light bulb that is part of a house or the same year that the house was built.\n5. The answer is D: house.\n\nAnswer: D: house", "answer": "C: candle"}

Choice A (train station) could be the place where one can possibly find some magazines to read if waiting for a train, but the same concept remains true to other places like a bookstore (choice B), newsstand (choice C), or waiting room (choice D). The choice E (airport) may be related (e.g. magazine racks), not necessarily at a transportation station (e.g. airport), in order to wait for transportation. So, the answer that is a correct choice would be choice B (bookstore).\n\n### Input:\"Why not just eat dinner at the local diner?\" \"I don't like the food!\" John was irritated by that answer. A: diner B: restaurant C: cafeteria D: snackbar\nRationales:\n\n### The correct answer is D because snackbar is the only choice that has any correlation to the question asked in the context of the passage. If John was not satisfied with the answer of \"Why diner\", another response the author wants to convey by the question is that he may have given another reason and/or choice, and John was still irritated. Hence, John is irritated because he feels that the answer is still not satisfying the \"Why not\" from the author.\nSo, the correct answer is D: snackbar.\n\n\n### Input:#I'll do my work today, then get my lunch. #It's better to go at the beginning of the week to get lunch so I don't forget, then go to the gym. #Go shopping after that! #My favorite is to do my errands over the weekends! #That way I don't waste my lunch breaks! #The first three sentences convey these relationships between ideas: # A: do work, get lunch # B: get lunch, gym # C: gym, shopping # D: shopping, errands # E: errands, lunch breaks # #Is sentence # 6 A, B or C? #Answer: # I: D # II: C # III: D\nRationales: Choices A, B, and C are different types of sentences that give a relationship between", "answer": "A: train station"}

The first three options are unnecessary in this context while D is already mentioned in the question (or a version of it) and E, as well as the answer, requires too long and unclear sentence for an answer for the question.

The sentence does not directly indicate that the traffic is obstructed, but that the policemen wanted to \"clear\" something (obstructions, traffic, etc.) It could be that the traffic is completely flowing just as it is, and the policemen only want to avoid any obstacles from happening since traffic flows normally. \n2.

Hence, the balloon has a very important and significant role in a birthday party. \n\nThe third paragraph states that, \"When the first birthday party balloons go missing, that child will be in trouble.\" This sentence suggests that the balloons are a necessity to any birthday party and they are crucial to avoid any potential problems. \n\nBased on the two facts above, we could infer that balloons are indeed a staple of a birthday party.

Birthday balloon, therefore, are a must-have for a birthday party. Based on the above two points, it is very convincing to conclude that \" birthday balloon are staple at an birth day party\". The fact that birthday balloon plays crucial roles in birthday party, also proves that they are a staple of the birthday parties.

The final apples left in the 5th choice is 24 apples, which adds up to 104 appels.\n2. The choice of 46 apples and 47 apples is inaccurate because we already know that the kids bought 46 apples for the animals. \n3. Moreover, choice 41 apples is not an accurate answer since it includes the choice of 46 and 47 appls from before.\n4. Finally, choice 26 apples and choice 104 appls are incorrect answers because we already know that 46 apples are included in the total, and there are not enough apples (as stated from the choice itself) to add up to 105 apples.\n\nTherefore, 46 applez add up to 133 apples and 44 apples left to feed.\n\n\n### Input :  How many people attended the picnic?\n\n### Response :\nThe answer is 13.

Choices:  A :  didn't close his ears B : would have bought a noseplug C : didn't close his eyes D : wore gloves E : forgot a mask\nRationales:\n1. The question has a word that implies a smell and that also says the man had an aversion, which means that he did not want to smell something because somehow it bothered him.\n2. Choice A refers to his ears, and is a sensation that would not necessarily have a smell, thus it would not help him not to have to suffer from the smell.\n3. Choices B and E refer to covering up other senses, and B also refers to a physical action of covering off one's face and ears; however, the phrase \"if he\" suggests that there must be a reason why he would have to cover up these senses.\n4. Furthermore, the word \"condition\" also supports the choice of E because it seems as if the choice must have to do with a reaction of some kind- in this case of his smell and taste because it is clear that he suffers from the smell of it.\n5.

The man had cheated on his wife innumerable times.  After the womanizer had left, he called the speaker and said something to the effect that he wished his wife would have been as understanding as the speaker's wife was.  The speaker was in shock that his wife had understood the situation, even if it was only 1 or 2 cheating behaviors.  He wanted to know how his wife had responded to her finding out her husband had been unfaithful, especially regarding the last infidelity.  She said that she would never want to give him a hard time when it came to cheating because their marriage had been so good for such a long time.

Choices:   A: a kitchen B: a market C: a factory D: a bakery E: a store \nRationales:1. A multiple-choice question asks for a possible place where a baker would be found. A baker is someone who makes dough to be baked into bread and other baked goods. \n2. The question is looking for the possible place where a bakery can be found in a city. Bakery is the business and the item for sale is a baker\u2019s services. Choices (A) Kitchen and (B) Market  refer to possible food items that can be bought for the household. But baker does not sell food items. \n3. Choice (A) refers to the area where cooking can be done for people as part of the person\u2019s job or responsibility (like a cook) or as a hobby, where the area to cook is referred to as \u201ckitchen\u201d. Choice (B) refers to the area to buy food items.\n4. Choices (C) Factory and (D) Bakery refer to a store that sells cookies, bread, etc. but this doesn\u2019t mean that baker will be found in the store. They do not sell the baker\u2019s services but the goods that are baked.\n5. Choices (E) Store refers only to the goods sold by people who sell food.

Since it is 2 or more of the same things that are described, only 1 choice would be correct, thus choice E, \u201cA house\" or the general phrase \"a house\" could be a possible correct response.

Choices:  Blinky lights are likely to be a C:) a plane, E) light on a boat D) balloons, F) light on a train, B) a concert, A) an airport runway, G) lights on a helicopter\nInputs:If you see the lights, it is possible they are on a concert or plane. It is not likely that you will see a penguin' s butt or a boat's lights at three in the morning, since they are not blinking.\nInputs:If a plane is coming in for a landing, the light may not be moving and the blinking plane may be going in the opposite direction. \nInputs:If I am driving by in my car, I may not know what the source of the lights is, since they are not on my property and could be the blinking of the headlights of another car.\n\n### Response\nThe lights are blinking because it is a plane landing or a song from a concert. The lights on a train could also be coming from a train approaching at night, so they could also be on a plane. However, the lights might be part of another plane's engine from another airfield, so it is a possibility. It is unlikely you would see the blinking lights of a train, balloon or concert at the same time of night.\n\n### What are you likely to be looking for if the lights are in the air at night?\nDue to air traffic, the question implies a night time traffic pattern.  The lights would include blinking patterns.  You would know they are at night since someone would be there.  The pilot or singer is likely to be landing or performing at night.  The light could be the lights of a boat coming in at night, or it might be a balloon that was being launched and is blinking.  The lights could also be an airport runway.  Even if a carnival lights-up-a-big-carnival-flag-in-midtown-manhattan, the music would not cause it to blink", "answer": "B: plane"}

Thus, calling bull would mean the man is showing a disbelief in the animal being a bull.  Additionally, 'Bull' can also be used as a nickname for an overconfident or stupid person.

Additionally, since he had been searching for a solution, leaving a job and finding a new one would be a way to solve his issue: finding work.  Therefore, the best way to solve his problem is to look for a new work.  Hence, he should leave a job.", "answer": "D: female"}

There were four choices before \"brother's\", and none of them specified where the man went except for family reunion, which doesn't explain where the man went.\n4.

What could _only_ be one of them? Choices: \nA: the time and money it took to complete\nB: the materials used\nC: how original it was\nD: a mix of other things\nE: how well it fit the brief\nAnswer:\nE\n\n### Expl:\nWe learn from the question that there are a variety of factors which determine quality, not any particular factor.  We don't need to consider the time it took to complete, the materials used, the originality of the work, or if it even fit a brief, since we are only looking for one factor.  Thus the only variable we need to consider is, how well a given work fits a given brief.\n\n### Ext:\n\nSince _quality_ is described as something that it _makes_ well, and _makes_ is the word in the question that takes the place of the word \"is\", it only makes sense that _quality_ is the answer to this question.\n\n## Explanation (of my own work)\n\nThis is an example of a response I have wrote:\n\n### Instructions:\n\nJohn was the only member of the police academy who made it to the final test of physical skill.

In the game, the computer and player team up to find an enemy submarine, which the player then targets as a human player. (Studying the use of submarines in World War II, where they hunted cargo ships, helped the scientists determine the best strategy for the game.) When people face problems, such as creating innovations for products or solving problems in other areas of science, they follow a similar basic process: The first step is to search for an opening to solve the problem, and the electronic Battleship game simulates that search. \"People try a lot of different things to find an opening,\" says Mark Beeman, a psychologist at Northwestern University who conducted the Battleship experiment. \"When players are in the middle of solving the problem, there are so many little decisions to make, so many possible next moves.

Thus, the item with which you would clean up to eat is **the dirty dishes.**\n\n#### Rationale:\n**Fullness** means stuffed, which can only pertain to a person or item.  No person can clean up the dirty dishes to eat, so the correct choice is **the dirty dish.**\n\n**Underwear** means clean undies, which is what you would wear to eat.\n\n**Bad breath** can refer to a person.

There is only one glove-shaped type of Anemone in the whole world, the 'Glove Anemone'.\n\n### Response 2:\nChoices A, B, C, and D are locations of the Great Lakes- which are neither glove-shaped nor anemone. Choice E is the Atlantic Ocean, which is located in the Atlantic region and is the ocean with the most coastline, therefore anemones would not be found in the open Atlantic Ocean, but in the shallow or coastal waters of the ocean.\n\n### Response B: The correct response to this type of question is A: anemone in the glove shaped location; this is actually one of the easier problems for this task.\n\n### Rationales:\n1) The anemone is mentioned first in the question. The second part of the question is a question itself, but it follows \"there aren't many anenome in what glove- shaped state\", so the question refers back to answer what the glove is.\n2) Anemone are glove-shaped organisms and they are only in one glove-shappy state, which is Michigan.

{"text": "Careful on the usage of \"wallflower\" and \"standing still.\" These words are the same type, thus they are very confusing.  Use of 'wallflower' implies that the boy is NOT dancing as it is generally a term for a non-dancing person.  Moreover, it might be confused with the word wallfower -- which is a plant. Standing still can mean one stands when one already is standing, as well as being stationary.  Choice A does NOT have a concrete verb, thus is incorrect.\n\n* A: dance like crazi\n\n* B: standing still\n\n* C: wallflower\n\n* D: stand still\n\n* E: like dancing \n\n### Choice A:\n\n*  Dance like crazy: Dance like a crazy person.\n\n### Choices B and C\n\n*  Standing still: He was standing still.\n\n### Correct Answer: E is the only choice that makes sense in this context, and only has a concrete verb.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question begins with \"the\". We need the subject to be 'the boy.' \n\n2.  The verb after 'what was he' can only be one of the options.\n\n3.  This sentence describes what the boy is doing. \n\n4.  The \"the\" boy is most likely at a dance; if this is a ball then that means it is a 'dance.'

The question states why it is not the best way for one to ask questions if they are not ___? (Not ready to listen, willing to listen, etc) 2. When reading the choices and the context, only the answer choice eager to, satisfies everything in the question, so the answer has to be D.\n3. Not all people are ___ if you ask them something, willing to listen, ready to listen, is the same as saying that they will not listen, ready and willing are good combinations but willing is still not what makes it the best way to ask others questions.\n4. The word eager is a little ambiguous, because it can still be read as ready but it is a different mindset.

The Question requires a response in the form of whether or not one agrees with the claim. \n2. What is being asserted is that \"Society cannot exist\" without numbers. This clearly indicates one cannot not exist. \n3. Numbers affect society when they occur in the appropriate places allowing them to do so, such as the community or the populace. \n4. Any form of dysfunction in numbers such as not enough, too much, irregular, which would lead to the inability of a society to function will lead to the inability for community to exist. \n### Re-wording the Question:\n1.

We can better understand the type of numbers needed for a society to exist when we rephrase the question for ourselves. \n### Rationale Answer:\n1. The answer in terms of society existing well is based upon the conditions under which numbers work.

A gun\u2019s holster is normally where it remains until it is needed. The holster is an item that could have belonged to both the perpetrator and the target. However, this line of questioning is not needed to determine the perpetrator.\n4. The choice of the drawer is not what this question needs. This choice indicates that the investigator is considering the evidence beforehand.\n5. The investigator needs to send it back to the victim. There, they can further investigate and determine who has the weapon.\n6. The perpetrator needs to be considered as a suspect of the crime, so the investigator must find the weapon itself and not have it be kept as if in his own possession.\n7. The choice of back to its owner is excluded because this was beforehand consideration. He has a consideration for it already and is no longer considering it as a suspect unless he has found who perpetrated the crime.\n8. The choice of crime can be eliminated as a suspect. The crime scene is where they need to be as the evidence would be from there.\n9. The investigator has been considering the gun for a long time at this point, so he would have ruled out the suspect as the perpetrator of the crime.

Fire can be both a renewable source of energy (through the burning of biomass) or a nonrenewable source of energy (such as when it comes from burning fossil fuels such as coal or oil).\nThe only way one would know if fire was the oldest form of heat energy in the Earth would be if one knew what the oldest form of heat on earth was, which we don\u2019t know.\n\n### Chooses:\n\nChoice B: solar energy\nSolar energy is not necessarily the oldest source of heat on earth. This is because we don\u2019t know how long the sun has been there. Solar energy is not specifically old heat energy, and thus it is not the answer.\n\n### Chose:\n\nChoice C: Sun\nThe sun is a source of heat energy, but we don\u2019t know that it is the oldest. If the heat on the earth comes from the sun, then that could very well mean that it is the oldest, but it is only a possibility because we do not know how long the sun as been there.\n\n### The correct answer is C, with Sun\nWe know that the heat on the earth is from the sun, so it is possible that it is also the oldest heat source, but this is only a possibility because until we know for sure it is the oldest, we cannot choose it over the other choices. It is the oldest source of heat if it is the source of all heat on the earth. If it is not, it is not necessarily the oldest.\n\n### Inputs:\n1. The oldest heat source\n2. on Earth.\n3.", "answer": "B: solar energy"}

Answer choices \"A: wishing well\", \"C: hardware store\", \"E: utility room\" are wrong because \"wishing wells\" and \"utility rooms\" are not places you get pails from. \n3. Answer choice \"D: garage\" is an interesting option because a garage could be a place to get pails from. But \"garage\" also refers to a room one would use to store one's car, so it's unnecessary to specify when saying \"garage\" here.\n4. Therefore, the only correct answer choice is B: kitchen, because it's the most normal place one would expect a janitor to get a pail from.\nAnswer: B: kitchen\n\n### Input 2:\n\n## Rationale\n1. The question asks to identify which item is \"b\".\n2. The correct answer is C, which does not contain the digit 4.\n3.

The digits 2 and 8 are already part of the word \"eight\" in the answer choice, so having them appear in other words would not be reasonable.

Water fountains are not normally found near roads.\n\n**Choice B is incorrect.** Military bases can be found near roads, but people can also stand in line in other areas, such as the checkout line in a supermarket.

Hereditary can be anything, from physical features to mental features and from behavior to habits or the way you live your life. The doctor mentioned that it's not heredity or hereditary, and it actually means that it is the hereditary characteristic that actually caused the problem and affected the father's health.\n\nSo in conclusion, the answer to \"The doctor says her father was _____ and not heredity.\" should be \"Hereditary Genes\" because it is the only answer that makes sense.

Recognition is the first step in solving a problem. The second step is what? Choices: B: Recognition of the problem C: Solving the problem D: Knowing why E: Knowing something about the problem\nRationales: Recognition is the act of perceiving or noticing a person or thing.  Identification is the act or state of knowing something or someone.  Inference is the act of drawing a conclusion based on evidence.\n\nAn individual might want to be buying alcohol for a number of reasons.\nThere could be an implication that purchasing alcohol can lead one to trouble or problems. However, while some may buy alcohol to get intoxicated, some may also purchase alcohol for other reasons such as the desire to become sober or as a recreational activity.\n\nIn the question, while option D mentions buying beer, the answer needs to fit with the specific context of what could lead someone to buy beer.\nThe question indicates that the question is asking what could be the \"problem\" that someone faces. Hence, the options for the answer should have something to do with the question being asked and not something that refers to being intoxicated.\nTherefore, the options have been narrowed down to only the following two: 1) Being intoxicated or 2) Having a problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Recognition, or Recognition is the most important step when attempting to solve problem as it is the first step to beginning the resolution process.\n\nAnswer: B: Recognization\n\n### Demand: Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nWhy did the boy in the video buy beer and spend the money for it?\n\n### Answer the following multiple choice questions.\n\nInput: The boy in the video says that he bought beer and spent the money for it so that he could \"have a good time\".

The question is stating that you only have 25 years to live and, to extend this amount, you must pick 20.\n2. Life is referred to as how long, living or long life, therefore, the answers that are referred to the amount of time in your life, or how long this life is going to be.\n3. Choices B C & D are all referring to the amount of time this life is going to last and Choice E is referring to the amount of years that a \"life\" is, so therefore not refer to how long you are going to live, but instead the amount of time you live.\n4.

Choices: A: misinterpretation of the facts B: information that supports our view of the world C: feelings that we are correct about something D: evidence that helps our case E: the ability to see things clearly or clearly see something\nRationales:\n1. To answer this question we need to examine the other choices for which the (4) part of the question could be asking about or in a way referring to.\n1. Choice A: \"misinterpretation of the fact\" does not make sense in the context of the question. The choices given must explain a way that we can be correct about something or have our own ideas of the truth.\n2. In other words, they must make sense as things that we would consider as the basis for what could be true or real.\n3. Choices based on information, feelings and clear/clearly seeing could potentially serve as the basis for us to determine what is true, but they must also be real things in our mind in order for the question to make sense.\n4. Choices B, C, D, E, however, would only make sense as they stand, if they were our own understanding of what is true, rather than real things. \n5. Therefore, the correct choice of the part (4) of the question would be the choice that most directly refers to our own understanding about something like our perception of what is real.\n6. That choice is C: feeling that we are correct, as in this instance that is what the woman based her understanding of the thing's true nature on, namely: \"I feel like it's (whatever)\" rather than on real or tangible things.\n7.

The introductory paragraph is the introduction to the essay. It must contain an opening that attracts attention, and introduce the key points of the topic. If your essay has a main topic, an introductory paragraph should contain the general meaning of the piece and a sentence that provides the thesis statement or the main point of the essay.

E is what happens to the paper as it's saturated with water, not as it's left outside in the elements. A is not a material. B is ripped (or tear, is a verb) and a very brief verb.

Choice B is quickly and accurately, we can consider this as a good answer but what the person wants is what they want, and maybe they don't want things to be done as quickly/accurately because that wouldn't satisfy what they expect.\n3.

In the first case, a natural and healthy reaction to a good feeling is to show a smile.

Difficult could be an answer, but it is not as apparent as if the answer is simply what, and difficult is not a suitable fit. \n7.

This means that undermedication is causing this problem. Hence, if we assume that there is only ONE cause, which we cannot rule out completely, what the answer will be is the students having poor grades.<br>\n\n**Cause:** The students are undermedicated<br>\n**Effect:** The students have poor grades<br>\n\nWhen we look at the choices, we quickly eliminate a, because that does not match the stated cause.<br>\n\nA: Allergies are a common reaction to what does not usually happen to someone that has not previously eaten hamburgers.<br>\n\nFor the question, there was a cause and effect given, and another was added in the \"other\" answer.

{"text": "**Correction:** B: being late\n\n### Detailed Rationale:\n1. The key idea the author of the question wants to convey in this question is how waiting for a doctor is difficult for people with \"work\", and it is not necessary to have an appointment to see a doctor. \n\n2. From the choices, only one choice stands out to be a reasonable explanation due to its plausibility and relevance: to be late. \n\n3. \"Being late\" is a choice that not only fits, but describes the most relevant idea of the question's idea. \n\n4. Choice A is wrong because appointments are necessary for a doctor so that he or she can have a specific time to meet patients.\n\n5. Choice B indicates that people are going to be \"late\" for appointments, but it means that they would be late in general, not that they would be delayed in line with other patients. Furthermore, the idea that the author wants to point out is a delay in the doctor's process, so the idea is not that the patient needs to make an appointment. \n\n6. Choice C can be eliminated due to its unreliability, as it doesn't make sense to say that the length of an appointment is what is time consuming. \n\n7. Choice D is wrong, as patients of the doctor may be delayed but are still able to reach the doctor's office on time if they are not scheduled to meet with the doctor at specific appointments. \n\n8. Choice E can also be eliminated, as patients could be late due to impatience, but they can still be seen by the doctor even if it takes longer than expected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: being late.", "answer": "D: time consuming"}

So the most appropriate answer is that Reading a newspaper \"gives you a learning about world\" because it allows you to obtain information about events in your local area.\n7.

Option D: \u201cE\u201d grocery store isn\u2019t a choice because groceries are different from my morning paper. Option E: \u201cB\u201d Classroom is another choice that might be better, even though it would imply that I don\u2019t work in a classroom. A: classroom might come to mind if I\u2019m implying that the answer is the front porch where I would put the paper if I could (which is a choice). If A: classroom is the answer, I just would put it with other papers on my desk at home.\n### D: is a better answer because if I had not chosen to not be left my paper by a front porch, I wouldn\u2019t have to get the paper in the first place.

{"text": "### Rationales:\n\n### 1. If a large village is found in an area of countryside, it would be unlikely to be a large village of only 50,000. This is the case because if the total area of countrysides is less than 3.45691388419868e+07 then that is less than 50,0 0,000, so the chances of that area being a large village is very low.\n\n### 2. If a large village, of more than 50, 000, is in an area of counrtyside, that are is likely to contain more villages, which would make it unlikely to contain a large village. This is because every village must be located within an area.\n\n### If a large village of more than 5 million is found in an area with populations exceeding 15 million people, it is unlikely that area contains a large village.\n\nThis is because if the total areal population of that area is bigger than 3.41691384199768e+08, that would mean that there over 15 million people living in that area, so it is more likely to contain more than one large village than just 1 single large village.\n\n### Conclusions:\n\n### Choices A and B are both incorrect. Choices A and B can be eliminated because countrysides have populations of less than 0,001 million.\n\n### Choice C is incorrect because the population of the suburbs has the sum of 12 516 554.

Therefore, we can dismiss one obvious answer. The question tells you that the person did not understand something, which means they disagreed with something, a negative statement. Because of that you cannot agree with or understand similarly with everything. The answer choice should be D: disagree with. That tells you that the speaker is disagreeing with something. The answer should not be A: understand because it just repeats what you asked and has no bearing on what they disagree with. The answer should not B: know because it also repeats what you asked.

The question asks who the younger woman could be talking to.\n2. There is a possibility that the question could be asking who the younger woman could possibly be talking about.\n3. The choice 'Her mother' seems plausible because the older woman (her mother) could also be referred to as 'the older woman'.\n4. The choice 'The girl of her dreams' is also a good choice as we can say that this is how the young woman feels and is speaking to in imagination.\n5. Therefore, A: An author is correct.\n6. The choice 'Herself' doesn't fit because we clearly know it to be 'Herself' and not an author.\n7. There is no sense of an author being mentioned, so 'B' is not the correct choice.\n8.

The choice A: friendship refers to when people would help one another out, such as if one person needed help with their homework, the other would gladly help. Choices B: aggression, C: defeat, D: winning or losing, and E: sweat all do not describe people helping each other.\n2. Choice A: friendship also does not capture what people gain out of competition, while choices B: aggression and D: winning or losing imply more of a negative aspect, whereas choices C: defeat and E: sweat imply positive results of a competition.\n3. Choices C: defeat and D: winning or losig are the only choices that capture competition in terms of positive and negative outcomes, hence choice D: winning or losing is the most appropriate. \n4. Choice E: sweat describes what two people have to do in order to compete, which suggests that two people's effort has to be exerted in some capacity, but not a literal sweat.

Paying money for something, demanding satisfaction, and even spending money are all activities associated with purchasing an item of value from a merchant, aka going shopping.  However, hunting for the item, mailing an order, or demanding satisfaction, do not necessarily describe activities that are exclusive to shopping, or even to customers.

Choices::  A: practice all summer B: get better C: make a new friend D: express myself E: make a new guitar\n\n### Response. \n\n#### C: make a new guitar.\n# The question is \"I just wanted to what?\" It seems like \"practice all summer\" couldn't be the right choice, because it isn't \"what I just wanted to do\" but the fact I already have a guitar, a good one.\n # But \"to get better\" could mean I just wanted to get better, but at the end of the sentence I said that I didn't need anything new. In this case, \"practice all over\" would better suit the original statement, \"I wanted to do something new\", therefore, A: Practice all summer is the correct answer.\n# But notice that when it comes to getting \"better\", I also don't need something new, and making a new guitar wouldn't be something new, even though it is a new guitar.

They have a lid on the top with handles on the sides. Trunks are also used to carry items. They are made of wood or metal. The trunk is usually large enough to hold undergarments, outer garments, and sometimes books, and can be wheeled.\n3. Trunks can be used to store a variety of items, including clothes, books, and valuables.\n4. Washing machines are used by people to wash clothes, and are kept close to the sink like a stand-alone washer. They tend to be metal, and have a large load capacity. They come in various shapes and sizes.\n\nDifferences between a trunk and a washing machine:\n\n1. What type of item is it?\n  1. Trunk - Trunks are large containers with a lid on top. They have handles on the sides of the trunk.\n  2. Washing machine - A washing machine is a device that is used to clean dirty clothes.\n\n2. What is the primary purpose of the item?\n  1. The trunk and the washing machine both have the primary purpose of storing clothes. However, they have different purposes.\n  2. The purpose of the trunk is to store objects. It has a large capacity, so it can also be used to store items such as books and valuables.\n  3. The washing machine only stores clothes. However, it is not a large-sized trunk.\n\n3. Where can the item be found?\n  1. A trunk can be located in a variety of places: they can be found behind your living room door, under your bed, or on top of your bookshelf.\n  2. A washing machine is kept in the laundry room.\n\n4. How is the item used?\n  1. People put their clothes in the trunk, and then they carry it to the laundromat.

{"text": "### Reasoning behind the response: \n\n1. First, we must identify the correct phrase that needs explanation. The sentence states- \u201cSam didn't like (the people) he met\u201d, meaning that he didn't like the individuals he had met during travel.\n2. Second, choose the best word that would describe or identify what he might do in order to get away from them. From the options, coming home seems impractical and unrealistic as this option would have the same people involved, unless he was going to meet them some place he was familiar with.\n3. Therefore the answer choice that can be made is to go out with those people.\n4. Go out means to go out socializing with these people.\n5. Alternatively, staying home, learning from each other or making art is out of the question as they wouldn't allow Sam to get away from them because none of the options would require people to leave or separate.\n6.

{"text": "A: town\n\n### Dem:The word \"town\" is specifically referenced. Since one would not normally sit down and take a dump watching a movie, the bathroom is not the answer. The theater was a good consideration, but the \"often\" in the question indicates singular. Also, when a new movie is out, it is often shown at the theater.\n\n\n### Input I find this question quite confusing because of the difference in spelling between \"movie\" and \"movie\". I understand that the question is asking which of the options is most common as opposed to correct, but I am not sure if that is what the question is asking.\n### Dem:In this instance, \"movie\" is correct as in more commonly used rather than the more grammatically correct \"movie\" for \"films\". Also, given a choice between bathroom or theatre, the latter is more accurate according to the way the subject is worded in the question. So, I would answer \"Theater\".\n### Input:The best thing you can do is to prepare and practice before this? Choices:  I: game A: race B: meeting C: test D: competition E: exam\n\n### Dem I understand from these questions that it has something to do with the verb that \"you can do\" as I had thought. I think of practice (or practicing) as a verb. But, the best you can do is to practice. I thought competition was the best thing to do before an exam, but I like the word \"practice\" the most of everything.\n### Dem This question is ambiguous in that the answer word - \"practice\" or \"race\" - depends on the meaning that is meant. If the sentence reads \"The best thing to do before a race is to practice\", then \"practice\" is the correct answer. However, if \"race\" is defined to include or be synonymous with a trial, exam or test, then \"practice for a test\" would be the correct answer. \n### Definitions: A question is ambiguous if it has more than one possible meaning. Thus in the case of the question, it reads: \"The best thing you can ____ before ____\" (race = game; test = practice). \"What is the best thing you can ___ before ___?\" In this case, practice/game or test/race,", "answer": "D: theater"}

Choice C: \"space shuttle\" is the closest option that describes what the question is asking as something big enough to receive damage with broken glass. \n4. Choice is probably not an option. \n5.

Therefore, it seems the best answer choice is C: space shuttles. \n8.

At the airport, there are many security personnel from the baggage and screening areas to security cameras and police.  Also, security at an airport must be maintained for many reasons including crime and terrorism.  All of these issues can be criticized or considered to be insecure.  The same goes for the concert.

I believe that the question means that the commuters waited at the station for a long period of time since the question specifically asked that it was a lovely afternoon. The trains stopped, traffic stopped, and the commuters stood at the station. They waited patiently at this station. After a few hours or so they begin moving around to find a more accommodating station. Some commuter may be uncomfortable and just continue to wait at the station.

{"text": "This question asks the reader to choose from the choices that best summarize the main meaning of the word \"promote\". The following is the list of all the choices given: \"was being promoted\".\n\n### Demostration:The first thing to do is to list the main parts of the sentence to identify the part that is being promoted. Looking over the sentence, the key part in line with the question is \"hands washing\", which is a main part of the sentence. Thus, the part being promoted is \"hands wash\", as it is the main verb in the sentence, and the key point to the question, to answer it, is to choose from the given answers the choice that best describes this main verb, as the word \"promoted\" suggests.\n\n### Next, we have to understand what exactly is \"promoted\". Looking at the choices we have for our answer, we can find that only choice C can best describe this verb. Examining the choices, we find that Choice D does not make any sense, as the word \"become\" is a transitive verb, which means that at most, it should be used in the form of a compound verb, and it cannot simply act as an adjective, as it is placed in this choice. The choice could have been altered to some form like, \"dry skin become wet after being promoted\", but that wouldn't convey the correct meaning, as the verb \"become\" still is the primary verb, and thus does not follow the format of the question. For the same reason, Choice B also cannot be interpreted as best summarizing the main meaning of the phrase \"promoted\".\n\nChoices C, A, and E are the only three choices that can be correctly interpreted to best summarize the meaning of the phrase \"hands wash\" in the context of the question. Choice C is a suitable answer, for it fits perfectly with the structure of the sentence, as the word that can be best summarized using this phrase is the word \"hand\". The second option is \"Cold hands,\" which could be interpreted as the action of hands, or as a feeling or emotion in general. A \"wet floor\" cannot be answered with Choice D because it is a noun and cannot summarize anything. Finally, \"Dry skin\" is an adverb, which can in general neither summarize a verb nor be the main focus of the", "answer": "C: health"}

In an ironic way, this is just one of those things that seems great for the future but often does little to nothing in the here and now.

{"text": "In order to choose the correct answer from the choices we first need to look at the prefix \"ne-\" or \"mal-\" to understand the meaning of the word.  \"Ne-\" usually gives a negative meaning, while \"mal-\" more often than not has a negative connotation.  \"Greasy\" is a negative word in and of itself, but its origins are related to cleanliness.  Thus, according to both etymology and the English language, \"Greasy\" can be construed as a word for excessive amounts of oiliness on one's person.  The term \"greasy teens\" seems to be the informal admonishment of teenagers who appear in dire need of cleaning themselves for societal norms or to be more precise, socially accepted in public.\n\nNext, we need to understand if the choice refers to the teenage individual who suffers the effects of the negative connotations of \"greasy\" or to the teenagers of the time who are often stereotyped with such a slanderous term.  From this logic, the first option would be option D: cleanliness.  Giving a deeper more thorough examination, the word \"cleanliness\" can refer to the actions or feelings associated with hygiene.  Again, the term \"greasy\" when used in a detirmental way is intended to call out teenagers who do not take care of themselves.  Since most teenagers go through a faze of experimenting with fashion and appearance, it would make sense that the choice would be about cleanliness.\n\nThe next logical answer is option E: satisfaction.  \"Satisfaction\" is a broader term than \"cleanliness\", referring to the subjective experience of feeling complete or fulfilled with life or one's body, or even emotions.  A teenager may be satisfied to not groom themselves to an aesthetically pleasing experience but more so what is acceptable to society.  For many teens, this is a difficult process and can be mentally and emotionally taxing so it would be more accurate to say that the choice would be a more general term that accounts for all the choices, option E.\n\n### Answer:  D: cleanliness\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Someone with \"hight\"", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}

Choices: A: flaws B: value C: issues D: merit E: problems\nRationales:\n1. The correct answer should be able to explain what problems were detected by the personality test. Choices A, B, and C do not make sense as answers.\n2. Choice D indicates that there were actual problems with the test, but this is not the correct answer. Choice E is not the appropriate answer either because it states that there were problems, not that the problems had merit.\n3. Choices B and C are too general to suggest what the actual problems with the test were.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is E as it refers specifically to the problems of the test without stating that they had merit.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput:The man had no idea what his family was going through when he left for what?

{"text": "Even though the man was hoping to sell it at a high-end jewelry store, the man on the street corner wasn't actually trying to sell it in the first place; what he was trying to do was hock the watch for some drug money.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The first word choice out of the four options is \"jewelry\" and this term means that someone is using high-quality material to make ornate or fancy wearables/trinkets.\n2. This first choice doesn't fit because it is not a trinket or ornate object because we know it is a wristwatch.\n3. The next option would be \"Case,\" and this means either a container or a container device which is used with a pocket watch, for example.\n4. The next option is \"hock,\" and in this case, it is used with the word \"watch.\"\n5. Hocking would mean that you are working with or showing off your watches and you will put up your watches for sale, so this doesn't fit the context because the man is only hoping to \"sell\" the watch for money, he isn't actually trying to do it immediately or show it off.\n6. The last option is \"Pawn,\" and this is done to get some cash. When you pawn something or when you show something off from the pawn shops, it means that you will be giving up the object in exchange for money so that you can use the money for short-term or immediate needs.\n7. However, the man hasn't pawned or loaned out the watch and the word \"Pawn\" doesn't quite make sense to the context because he is just trying to sell it somewhere.\n8. Therefore, the correct answer is E - pawn, because it is the only correct choice that fits with both the wording of the sentence and also with the context of the sentences.\nAnswer: E - Pawn\n9. If we choose another choice to the answer like B or C, this would mean that someone is trying to sell something that isn't fancy or valuable, which would be incorrect.\n10. The phrase \"The man on the street wasn't trying to sell the watch.\" suggests that he was trying to get money for the watch, even though it isn't fancy and valuable, so we know", "answer": "C: hock"}
{"text": "### Demostration:\ninput: He's just a common person who does what he wants to what? Choices A: do B : care C: think D E: believe\nRationales:\n1. the phrase \"Do what he wants to\" indicates that he is not controlled by higher-ups, meaning that he does what he want, which is why answer: A is correct.\n2. The answer: A was correct\nInput: It's impossible to find out where the problem came in, the person simply can't put two and two together in thinking about what occurred. Choices:  A : get right B : understand C : comprehend D : determine E : get it\nRationales: The words \"it's\" and \"to\" indicate that \"it\" is not, in this context, a counting object of two and two. Rather \"it\" refers to the word \"thinking\". \"two and two\" then becomes a phrase that is part of what the person thinks in trying to understand where the cause for the problem occurred. Thus, answer C is incorrect, as \"comprehend\" as it applies to the use of two and two in the phrase means to understand something or someone after observing or thinking about what they have done, not to understand where the reason for a problem originates. The same follows for answer B. As for D, \"determine\" as it's listed would be appropriate if the problem was based on the person not being able to identify where the problem occurred and needed to determine a cause, but we can infer from the context that the problem was in not being able to think where the problem originated in a more logical way.\n3. Answer A is correct because it means that the person could not find out where the problem of not being able to understand the cause came from. We have to take into account the entire phrase.\n\n### Input : When the president is going to be there, the person has to what? Choices :  A : give an exam B : make a decision C : have a conversation D : take a test E : take a shot\n\n### Rationales:\n1:Give an exam is an action you do at an exam and not the event (a word that is present in the text without any plural form) which follows the event, as in \"The test is after having given the exam.\" Thus", "answer": "C: transistor"}

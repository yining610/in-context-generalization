Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what?

Choices:  A: present B: stay here C: closer D: available E: come here<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I think that my response would contain a lot of words in an attempt to correctly address each of the questions the instructor asks, while still remaining succinct. I believe my response will be approximately the same length as the instructions above. My response, then, will consist of the sentences above, as well as the required response for each of the sentence-questions above.<n><n>### Input for Response:<n><n>The first sentence of my response should be that my response has everything the instructor asks for in the first sentence. I chose the words "very good", because this is an open task, and I feel most comfortable addressing the task at its core. The second sentence of my response will be exactly as directed by the question: "Everybody has some sort of what?". This sentence is where I believe we will be focusing the bulk of the sentence-questions, as this is where the task will seemingly come into focus. The second sentence should be approximately 60% of the total length of my response. The third sentence of my response would be the first question given. The question in question would be that: "high quality for the money he (John) spent, but the chair (John's new chair) fell apart from what?" The response we want here is of course the answer to this question, namely that the chair fell apart because of what? Of course it's the instructor's job to determine the correct answer, so I won't include the answer here. After coming up with an answer to the question "what caused the chair to literally fall apart?" you can find the correct answer below in the answer field. The third question of my response to this instruction might not be the best answer, but it probably would help you narrow down the options. The reason for this, is that I would choose to answer "C" (medium) in my response. The reason for this is that it stands out more than the other choices, I felt that this particular choice was also the most likely choice in the question. The fourth choice in my response would simply be the last sentence that was input to the response. Again, this sentence will be approximately 60 % of the entire total response. This response follows this structure, and does follow the instruction.<n>

Choices:  A: crack B: antipathy C: being mean D: disinterest E: unfeeling<n><n>### Response:		<n>My response would be the answer was E: unfeeling.<n><n>#### Solution:<n>The first instruction asks what John did to make the death of the corpse more thorough. One can come up with possible answers, one of which is "careful". However, careful is defined so that one can apply a high level of thoughtfulness or caution. This definition doesn't necessarily explain what is meant by "thorough" and doesn't say anything about what a thorough approach would be. It only tells one what to do. This is a deficiency in the instruction. It does not tell one what kind of examination would be thorough. "Careful" would just be a kind of examination that could be thorough or not. This instruction tells one to perform a task, but does not tell one what the desired outcome should be.<n><n>The second instruction asks what we express by using our creativity. This is a much more specific question in comparison to the first. It also helps that this second instruction provides the user with some direction by giving specific examples of actions. This instruction provides the user with more instruction and is appropriate in that it can be a good prompt for developing the response that describes it.<n><n>The third instruction asks about an action that can happen to a chair. It doesn't give direction on how that chair might be built to avoid that action from happening. This action could describe a faulty design that makes the chair cheaply manufactured and easy to break. All the instruction says, is that the quality "bad," is too vague, and is not useful in a response. Given all this, it is easier to come up with a response that describes the cause of death, expresses creativity, and describes how one uses their creativity after reading this instruction.

This clarification is crucial when a task is ambiguous and the instructions contain multiple choice options. To avoid misunderstandings, a teacher needs to write clear instructions so the students can write clear answers, which can increase the score.<n>### Explanation:<n>The only mistake here is in the first answer, it should be D. “D” must be chosen.<n><n>### Notes:<n>As you can see, the instruction in the first answer should be “thoughtful,” not “thought”. It is often better for questions on multiple choice exams to be read aloud instead of being done on paper. Avoid using passive verbs, where the subject is hidden in a complicated phrase. Instead, use a more straightforward and concise phrasing.<n><n>### <n>

Choices:  A: radio station B: recording studio C: concert D: tv studio E: new york<n><n>### Response:		The answer choices for the first question are "through". "Thorough" and "thoroughly" mean doing something conscientiously, completely, and without mistake, paying attention to detail. "Perfunctory" means doing something to fulfill a duty with a minimum of effort, care, or concern. "Miss" or "misses" means to not notice something when it is present, to fail to discover its presence, or to fail to use or take into consideration its presence. The second question's choices are all types of creativity. "Craftsman of art" and "art" mean a person who designs or makes things, especially in a traditional manner.  The third choice is related to the second but has a different word order. "Poor workmanship" or "workmanship of poor quality" is a phrase that means poor-quality craftsmanship. A "boom microphone" is one with a large or loudspeaker at one end and whose direction is changed by the placement of the other end. The fourth and final choice is incorrect because "new york" is not a specific region but a city that can also be modified into an adjective or noun for "from new york." It's in reference to the lyrics of the song "American Pie." The fifth and final choice is "A: recording studio", which is where most albums are recorded.<n><n>### Credit:<n><n>### Citation:<n>

Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Choices:  A: bollywood B: record C: musical D: jukebox E: napster<n><n>### Response:		<n>The movie had a musical score and the songs were Bollywood songs.<n><n>### Input-Output:<n>Puzzle.<n>```<n>Mike's best friend is Jeff<n>Jeff's favorite author is Mark Twain.<n>Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn.<n>Huckleberry Finn was written by Huckleberry Finn (not the real name of the author).<n>Huckleberry Finns favorite food is pizza.<n>Jeff doesn't like pizza.<n>Mike doesn't like either pizza or Huckleberry Finn<n>This is a classic example of a chain of implication. It can be solved using what?<n>```<n>### Response 1:<n>The chain of implication can solved by using the process of elimination. We have to assume that Mike has good taste about movies because we know he likes a classic like Huckleberry Finn, in fact, he must like it a lot. We have to assume Jeff, since he has good taste in movies, has good taste in food, and his favorite author must have good taste in food too. So Mark twain should like pizza, and since his favorite food is pizza he must like pizza. Since Mark Twain is Jeff's favorite author, he must, also, like pizza. Mike likes pizza, but he does not like Huckleberry, and the chain of implication ends.<n><n>### Response 2:<n>One could use the rules of the syllogism to solve the chain of implication. One could use deductive reasoning. One could use valid reasoning. In logical terms, this kind of reasoning is called the “principle of universal generalization.” If we can find one individual (or set of individuals) that exhibits a certain kind of behavior, it follows that all individuals (or a member of a class) will possess the same behavior. We know that Jeff does not like pizza, therefore the other individuals in the chain do not like pizza because if Jeff’s favorite movie is good, so is the other movies he likes.<n><n>

We can't know which route the road is going to take (either South or Southwest) but if he is going to stop for it to make sense, the next answer option should be Mexico, right?<n><n>You have the option to explain how John would end up in Mexico.<n><n>Hypothesizing the answer seems to be the best idea. The problem is that you have to find a situation where John is not going to stop anywhere even when the road takes him to a stop. In that case, you should tell that situation too, in order to explain why John would end up in mexico.<n><n>Answer: John's trip south is going to end somewhere. It's also going to end somewhere on the West Coast, as the entire route is on the West Coast. The only choice that makes sense is Mexico because you cannot end your trip in the middle of a desert (i.e. desert developed land).

Choices:  A: amount to nothing B: visit relatives C: charming D: doctor himself E: cross street<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>**A: The first thing to realize is that the person is wounded and is probably bleeding. If he is bleeding, he must stop the bleeding before he can worry about anything else.<n><n>**The best way for him to do this is to first apply pressure to the wound for about five minutes to slow the blood flow and then wrap gauze or a clean dressing securely around it. Don’t try to remove your cloth if the bleeding starts again, that may damage important blood vessels.<n><n>**Second, he should find shelter from the weather. If the weather is foul and the wound is bad, he should use all of his energy on treating it before worrying about anything else.<n>After these two tasks have been completed, the hiker may consider looking for help. Though looking for help sounds like an easy task, sometimes doing this is complicated and even dangerous if other walkers are on the same trail or if help is not nearby. If the person’s strength permits, he should consider building a fire to keep warm. Even if there is little to cook, a fire can be used to dry clothes. In cold weather he may be better off without clothes but without food.<n>**Some people are fortunate enough to come across a house during their walk but a house might just be the last thing they want to encounter. It is often better to stay outside than to enter a home unless it is safe to do so.<n><n>**Finally, the only thing that might help him more would be to find help. He should try to find a stream or a lake and not a puddle in the middle of woods. If no water is found, some other type of shelter or protection from the weather should be sought out. <n>**It may not always be possible to find help, in which case he can try to sleep to regain lost energy.**<n><n>**In conclusion, the hiker should be sure to take care of himself before taking care of anybody or anything else. This will ensure the survival of his body and if he is found, possibly his mind.<n><n>**Best Regards.**<n>

He would not have if he had been <n>more thoughtful.<n>```<n><n>### Response<n><n>Hey there, my name is James and I'll be answering your prompt on today at 3pm. I went with my best friend Andrew to the local hardware store earlier and we had to wait for our turn at the cashier. We were chilling out in the corner, and then someone ran over to us and asked us to step aside while they got past us. The guy who ran over from behind us actually looked like we had interrupted his journey to the restroom because right afterwards they ran back into the restroom door and slammed it.<n><n>I turned to my best friend Andrew and I pointed to the door which was 4 feet away. Andrew saw it too and we both laughed. Imagine spending 4 minutes running a errand to the restroom and the first thing you do when you are out is wait in line at the cashier? No thanks!<n><n>After that incident we went home and I decided to do some shopping and ordered some food at the same time. We did some cooking together and I found it weird that Andrew always cooks more and never just half way finished it. So I waited impatiently for them to clean dishes after we finished.<n><n>I really just wanted to know this question because that guy running into the restroom seemed really silly. I have tried to think of a reason that he did that, and I have never seen someone do that. In fact, I have made it my goal now to see a person run into the restroom door like that. That guy must be really insecure about running into the restroom door to do that. I wonder how someone can have so much insecurities.<n>

To be indispensable.  Not only are you worth more but you have more clout in your job and feel more independent.  Having a good, secure job is like having a safety net in case you fail; it protects you from hardships, and a bad job is like having a noose around your neck.  I like the idea of being indispensable and how well received I am at my job is important to me so i try to make sure I always do things right.<n>```<n><n>### Note:<n>This response is not as well written as the responses given later but is satisfactory.

I think that the length of stay for a business trip is totally based on the business that one is engaged in.  The length of the trip should not be too long because then personal lives do not get enough attention.  A well balanced amount would be approximately three to four weeks.<n>```<n><n><n>### Input <n>```<n>Writing is a very powerful tool--one often overlooked by people in their everyday lives.  I really couldn't imagine my life without the art of writing.  In school writing was a required homework and assignment, but now most of the writing I do is of my own accord--in journals, in my own writings, and every now and then in the form of a note, or a letter.

Some of the bedrooms had wooden beams for ceilings.   There were no walls.   **<*b*>The two small square windows</ul>** were very high above the floor.   There were holes under the windows which had probably once held a platform on which heavy rush mats were rolled up to protect the floor from rain.   In those days there were long rush mats made locally and used for covering the floor in bad weather.   Above the window was a wide sill, and the floor above in the room was a full storey high off the ground.  <n><n>We had very beautiful trees in the nearby woodlands,   The oaks, hickories, sassafrases and maples were very tall and handsome.

Choices:  A: desire B: spending money C: money D: needs E: time<n><n>### Response:		<n>**Answer:** C<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>Say something to the effect that the best way of buying products is to compare them and be careful and thorough, and that desire or need doesn't necessarily bring the best results.  Be sure to describe what you mean by 'buying to fit the time you are living in'.  Be sure to give examples of both good and bad products.<n><n>### Input<n><n>#### Response<n><n>I know you've bought clothes that didn't take you past lunch that day or shoes that were too heavy for you at work.  Those purchases can be disappointing.  I've heard of the 90 day guarantee that some stores use to guarantee satisfaction by the customer.  Maybe that would make it better for you to compare two sets of products before buying, but that would take a lot of planning.  I've known many people that have been satisfied with what they buy, so I know it's possible.  I think you need to do your homework before buying to make sure you get the quality or price that you want.  Be sure to check out every store that sells the product so that you know the pros and cons of each place to get what you want.  Some things can be cheaper, but don't cut corners on the things that you spend the most money on -- maybe you will lose money in the long run?  Buying something so that it will fit the kind of person you are is important.  I see some companies making a lot of money on things based on fads, or trends, but you will know when you buy something and have used it for a while if you really like it or not.  That's the time when you are comfortable enough to know whether you made your decision well or not.  You might go back more often to a restaurant that you enjoyed, but you probably wouldn't drive a car that you weren't comfortable with.  A car that you didn't feel good driving could give you stress in the end.  Sometimes it may take a lot longer to make up for the extra money a more expensive product costs, but I know a guy that bought a house based on the reputation of the carpenter that put it together.  He wanted to make sure he had the quality of materials that he expected -- as the saying goes -- build it once, and build it

Each is different, the first is closest to the question, because of the order. The second is a different word, but still closer in meaning - as opposed to the third and forth.  I have seen 'perfunctory', but not 'thoughtful'.  I have seen 'complete', but not 'thorough'.<n><n>I think the difference in word order here could have been caused by an error in the transcription. There was one 'what' in both of the previous sentences, and that is the only word which appears for the same term twice in a row.  I think a likely cause could have been typing too fast (or too inaccurately), and ending up with different order than intended. Perhaps even different words than intended,  especially if the author wrote 'everybody' instead of 'anybody' and the transcriptionist took the author's spelling choices rather than correcting them with 'anybody'.<n><n>Sometimes 'thoughtful' is thoughtful enough, but 'thorough' is not nearly as thoughtful as 'careful'.  "He did as he was required to do, but he was hasty enough that he didn't catch everything" is in a different order, with different tone, than "Everything went by so fast that he didn't notice everything he was expected to notice".<n>```<n>

Choices: A: computer B: outlet C: socket D: extension cord E: bathhouse door<n><n>The correct answer is option B.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>This is an example of a shortened form of an instruction. An abbreviated instruction that is written in English has a shortened form of a main idea, but the same information is still there. For example, the task is for you to write correctly and in the shortest way possible. A shortened form of an abbreviated sentence describes a shortened form of instruction, which means you put a shortened form of the main idea. The shortened form of the abbreviated sentence is not exactly the same as the shortened form of the instruction. The question to solve is that the shortened form of an English sentence is not the same as the shortended form of an abbreviate sentence. The shortened form o an abbreviated sentence is a shortened form of English sentence, for example, the shortened form of “John was thoughtful.” is an abbreviated sentence. The shortened version of the English sentence is “John was thoughtful” and the shortened form of this abbreviated sentence is “John was thorough.” The abbreviated sentence is the same as the English sentence but the shortened form of it is not the same, because the English sentence is “thoughtful” but the shortened version is “thorough.”<n><n>### Input/Output:<n>The input is an abbreviated English sentence, the input is “Everybody has some sort of what to express himself, it’s the best way to express yourself.” The output is the shortened version of the input sentence that is “Everybody has a form of creativity. The best way to express yourself is through creativity.”<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: tide pool B: beach sand C: tidepools D: current E: cooking pot<n><n>### Response:		The crab was strained because he had gone from a tidepool to a beach, which was a much larger area, and was having difficulty scuttling.<n><n>#### What's the Problem?<n>The problem here is that the crab is moving from a very small place to a much larger place, and is having trouble scuttling because, like John saying that he had performed a perfunctory inspection of the corpse, when looking at the larger area, the crab is looking in a perfunctory way. The crab, while moving in what is an adequate way, is having trouble moving more because of the fact that it's inadequate in a much larger area than the tide pool previously; it's performing, but isn't doing so adequately.<n><n>#### What do you do?<n>The crab's being stuck here because it's not used to moving in a much larger area, like the tidepool, as it's used to moving much smaller areas. The best solution is to make the crab change it's scuttling from being adequate to being more adequate. To do this, you can either move it out of the tidepool, or move the crab to a beach that has much smaller tidepools.<n><n>#### Is it a good solution?<n>It is an adequate solution, given the context. You could also have said the crab wasn't moving, but the context was implying the crab was moving, thus forcing a response of what would move the crab.

Choices:  A: the roof B: storage cabinet C: car trunk D: retail store E: home<n><n>### Response:		<n>We would not take advantage of our retail stores if there were other available options for us. It should be clear that the car comes with one storage cabinet (trunk). While there are ways to pack the car to get the maximum cargo space, there are times that a shopping bag does not allow the storage of another item into it. This is because it is too big, or has no way of holding up the other item or items. We would want to avoid the roof at all costs, and we should avoid placing it into the trunk because of the potential for theft. I would recommend that we place the shopping bags on the floor of the backseat. They should be on their side so that the shape of the bag does what? There will be room to put another item or two into the back of our vehicle. This, however, is not ideal because it might cause discomfort in the person riding in the back of the car, especially if it is a child.<n><n>### Inputs:  What would we need from the kitchen to start cooking dinner? Choices:  Canned green beans Canned stewed tomatoes Canned black beans Canned mushrooms Canned corn Canned spinach<n><n>### Response<n>Canned green beans, canned stewed tomatoes, canned corn, and canned mushrooms are vegetables. It seems as though they are already going to be available. It probably took some time to decide on making chili, and there is no way for your cook to find out exactly when you are making this dish. Even if he or she did, there may not be enough notice to take the rest of that food from the pantry. I understand that there are canned black beans, canned spinach, but I do not think they are necessary for a chili dinner. Your mother needs to make a choice if she wants to make this dish for dinner this evening. She does not need to get her vegetable ingredients in order to find something that you have been preparing.<n><n><n><n><n>

In other words, no one would want to "shake" a corpse.  The answer has been marked as "B", with incorrect for "C", "D" and "E" and unmarked for "A".<n><n>Explanation: F: This question refers to creativity, it asks you to select an answer that refers to the word "creativity'. It is therefore not about the definition of creativity, the task is to find an answer that means "creativity".The answer has been marked as F with incorrect for options A, B and E and "Unmarked" for option C and D.<n><n>Explanation:(3) The subject of the sentence, "we", is in the plural, so we respond to the question.  The other people might not necessarily respond in the same way. This means "we" mean what about "thanks"?  We will respond to the verb "showing" and show how to answer the question. The statement in the question is about what is in the second sentence: what we do when we thank?  We use the verb "respond". There's so much wrong with the word, I'll leave you to figure it out.<n>

While others are talking, we're formulating what we're going to say next, or thinking about a good comeback.  At a party, have you ever noticed that two to four people all begin talking at the same time, even though nobody is raising their voice?  This is probably happening because they're all trying to talk with the same purpose.  They all want to be listened to, and they start vying with each other.  The people doing the best job of listening aren't trying to be heard.  People who listen the best have a few qualities in common.  They  don't interrupt the person who's speaking, but they do ask questions, and they use body language that says they're actively listening.  Then, after you've finished talking, they summarize your conversation in their own words, just to make sure they understood it.  You know they've done this by their  response.<n>```<n><n>What do people who talk with another person the most, say?

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Answer: D: thorough<n><n>Input: Everybody has some sort of creativity, it's the best way to what?

Choices:  A: bad taste B: crummy C: cheap D: medium E: poor workmanship<n>Answer: E: poor workmanship<n><n>### Input:Why would a person be approached by a lot of people? Choices:  A: care about B: compliments C: know all D: popularity E: understand themselves<n><n>### Response:		The best answer is E. That is, if a person is popular and people often come to the person,  that person cares about and is concerned about what other people think of how they seem/ what they've done and how they appear.<n><n>### Commentary: To write an appropriate answer, you need know the definition of popularity. I also suggest looking closely at the context of the sentence, particularly the phrase, "a lot of people."  What comes after that phrase? I think you might find a bit of a clue there.<n><n>### Input to the Response:  In a sentence, which of these is correct, "I am not used to get" or "I am not used gets"? Choices:  A:"I am not used to getting" B:"I am not used getting" C:"I am not used get" D:"I am not used gets" E: "I am not used getting."<n><n>### Comment:  "get" is the 3rd person singular form of the present tense of get.  That is, there is only one "get", so get can not be used as the subject of the clause.  The clause used by John above is in a passive voice with the "get" used as a verb, and that is why he said that he was used "getting", which is not grammatically incorrect.<n><n>----<n>### Input to Response: Which of the following sentences is correct? Choices:  I never get a ride  I never to get a ride.  I never getting a ride.  I don't ride with my friends.  I don' want to get a ride.<n>Answers:  A: I never get a ride B: I never to get a new ride. C: I never getting a new ride.<n><n>### Response to Request: A:  I never get rides.  B: I never have got a ride.  C: I never have gotten a ride. D: I never get a rides.<n><n>### Explanation:  <n>The answer is "A: I never get rides." That sentence is technically incorrect.  The question was not posed to indicate which of the sentences is correct.  It is possible to use "get" as the subject of the sentence, however, then "get" can not be used in the passive voice of the sentence.  See

Choices:  A: chess set B: strategy C: toy store D: chess game E: small case<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer to this question isn't as simple as I was expecting it to be.  It is tempting to say "B: strategy" or "C: toy store" are the correct answers, because they both sound like a good place to put chess paran. I have to admit however, that I really disagree with those answers. The correct answer is "D: chess game".<n><n>Chess game's are for playing and storing chess pawns.  It might be tempting for people to put them in other places, but that would defeat the purpose of having a chess game in the first place.  The chess game was not made for any purpose other than to store and play chess pawns, any other use is not the intended use of the chelsea game.  I suggest that you put some thought into anything like this.  Otherwise, you may end up with something strange that just doesn't quite work.<n><n>

Choices:  A: being married B: sisters C: marriage D: two people E: lawyer<n><n>### Response:		<n>* The wording for this question is terrible - the word "marriage" would lead you to think the input is a wife in a relationship while the word "marriage status" would lead you to believe the input is a family member. You have to dig through the wording and find the implied question which is: "are you the wife or not" - The answer to this question is B: "wife"<n><n>* For D, the question is not "Do you want this as a lawyer?" You need to determine that this is an informal question to a lawyer who is asking for clarification of why the divorce is being requested (informal way to get a lawyer to help with something) - You can't use your first clue which is "A: being married" because divorce is not an option when married - You need to use your second clue "marriage" to determine the subject of this question is the wife and not the lawyer<n><n>---<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>1.

Choices:  A: india B: hole C: cage D: habitat E: rain forest<n><n>### Response:		<n>If it's a lemur it will reside in a rainforest as one would find in Africa.  But lemurs are also found on the island of Madagascar, which is more temperate and so not rain forest.  In the end a lemur lives in a tree and not a cage.  It's not india that has the indian monkey.  India's population resides in a habitat.  As for the hole it doesn't hold a lemon but perhaps a worm. There is no hole for a lemur which is made to live in a cage as a creature of the forest.  And so on this basis it is the correct answer which is habitat for it resides in the rain forest.<n>

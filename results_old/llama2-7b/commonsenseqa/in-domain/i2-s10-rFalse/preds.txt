Cutting fabric to order can include cutting patterns and assembling material.<n>Clothing store employees also sew garments. If the clothing customer can not sew the item the customer buys the clothing. Clothing fabric is always custom made to fit the customer and no items are ever the same. Sewing patterns, custom fitting, and custom sewing are all part of cutting fabrics to order. Custom made clothing fits the customer and not the clothing."<n><n>1.<n>"Your correct!

Choices:  A: employment B: frustration C: stress D: working hard E: love<n><n>### Response:		<n>If you look at the first two sample responses you can notice that the correct response had the same exact amount of lines in the sample as the sample input. The second part is where I am having trouble because it is written in a few formats, but also in the same amount of lines. I was told to respond like this:<n><n><center><n><img src="..\..\datafiles\Pics2.png" alt="Pics3" style="height: 10rem; width:10rem"/><n><img src="\..\..\data files\Pics4.png" alt="Picture 5" style="height:10rem; width :10rem" /><n></center><n><center><n><n><n>### Demostration:<n>The reason the answer to the third and last question is different is because the first two questions had the exact same amount of input lines as well as the number of correct answer lines. But in the last question,the input lines are 400 and the correct amount of lines is 52, so the last line is missing 7 lines, so that is why their response will not be 52. That was why I split the number of lines up into two parts: 400 for the input (the number the person gave on the sample response) but when they said 52 (the correct answer), I added those 7 lines to the total.<n>

Choices:  A: dance B: getting drunk C: meet new people D: having fun E: have fun<n><n>### Response:		Have Fun<n>----<n>In my opinion, all the things that describe the party were not the things jimmy did at the party. If you are trying to go to work or sleep, you probably try to stay away from parties. Also, If you are going to parties by yourself, why to bother to go at all. If you do not like the things you see there, that party is not for you. I see people trying to have fun at the party. It is just how they have fun.<n><n>### Input<n>Mary used to wear a shirt with stripes. At the age of thirty what was the material that she wore with it?

Choices:  A: roof B: room C: floor D: apartment E: neighbor's house<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I am reading magazines while I waiting for my vehicle on rails. This question perplexed me for quite some time. I was not sure if I was waiting for a train or on a train. This question is one of those questions that had me asking myself what I would be doing during the waiting process. I decided to choose option B which was “market.” This was my final answer based on the type of food that can be found on trains. I had to look at all my options except for vegetables. It was clear that market was my answer. Markets can be found in a variety of places ranging from street vendors to large supermarkets. The word market can be used as a noun and in sentences. An example would be: He always goes to the market to buy chickens for his family. This means that he is going to the market to look for chickens to buy and is not trying to sell chickens. If he were trying to sell chickin he would say he is going to the chickin market. This tells you that he is going to buy chickens.

If possible, how happy to be in company of friends, as the day faded, or in the dusk by a quiet lake or the fire-side on wintry evenings when our senses were attuned to some strain of soft, low-voiced music.<n><n>These moments of happiness are so fleeting, no sooner do they come than they are gone. We have hardly time to appreciate them, to absorb their full enjoyment, and then it is lost in the rush of other things of less permanent value. It is not that they go away from us entirely. They linger, and if we can once more make room in our lives for them, they come again and again to grace our days. They are the memories of happiness and the real strength of our lives. Happy moments are our best legacy to the future.<n>

In the following question, the seller must be a tailor shop because the clothing is customized for the customer. After reading the third task, there must be a decision to know whether it will be a smart decision or foolish. But if the gambler has never won, there would not be a need of returning the prize. It would not be a celebration. In the last task of the quiz, the selection of matchwinning means that the gambler has won the match when he is cashing in the prize.

Choices:  A: call 911 B: enjoy yourself C: get drunk D: having sex E: meet new people<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: B: C: D: E:<n>### The text starts with: _____<n><n>### Text:<n>It is the age of the tailor shop. Wherever you go fabrics have been cut to order. Ties have been sewn on coats. Sweatshirts, shirts and dresses have been fitted and altered to meet the needs of their customers. It is not for you to get up in the morning and decide “I feel like a sweater from the rack”. You go into a tailor store and they take your measurements and decide if the color and style are to your liking. It is not for your to choose and decide how much fabric is needed to sew a pair of Levis. That is what the tailor does. He chooses the color, style and amount of fabric to take and has the cloth cut for him by a cutter.<n><n>Tailor shops are what would be known as a seller in terms of merchandise. It is a place where fabrics are sold. You may have found cutters that are associated with tailor shops. They are what you would call wholesale cutters.<n><n>You go to a doctor to get your body fixed. You go to the hardware store to get your lawn fixed. You go to a doctor to fix a broken finger. You will go to a doctor to repair your heart and you will go to a hardware store to fix your lawn. This is because it has been established that these places are experts on those areas, so the job will be done well.<n><n>It is to be expected that you will go to a doctor. There will be a good doctor and a bad doctor and you will know which is the good one since the bad ones die off. But your lawn is quite another story. There are numerous yard services and yard sales and yard men who are all making money working on lawns. So in this way it would be foolish of you to go to a hardware store for a lawn repair. At least go to the hardware store for a pick ax.<n>

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Fabric is cut to order at what type of seller? Choices:  A: curtains B: tailor shop C: clothing store D: sewing room E: hardware store<n>Answer: B: tailor shop<n><n>Input: Where are you if your reading magazines while waiting for a vehicle on rails? Choices:  A: vegetables B: market C: doctor D: train station E: bookstore<n>Answer: D: train station<n><n>### Input:He was selling all his collector items even the rare plate, he had bought a lot at the what for the weekend? Choices:  A: supermarket B: kitchen cupboard C: table D: flea market E: dishwasher<n><n>### Response:		<n>The verb “sold” indicates that the plate happened to be owned by him. In other words, it happened to him.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>In this sentence, the pronoun referring to the plate (it) is not the subject (doe, he, she, etc), which does not change who the subject is (e.g., “The plate…who was owned by him” as opposed to “The plate was sold was owned by him.”). The pronoun refers directly back to “the plate” (he bought), which indicates that “he” is “doing something” to the plate (bought).<n><n>### Democracy<n><n>As for the word “democracy” the “-cracy” part of the word stands for “rule.” The first part of the word, “demo,” which usually means “people,” also denotes the “government” of the people (e.g., the rule of the people.). Together, these parts of the word indicate a system where the people rule or govern.<n><n>### Subjective<n>The verb phrase “to happen” is an -ize verb (e.g., happened, building, etc.). As for the past perfect tense (“which happened…”), remember this is past tense and the perfect tense (e.g., done, etc.) is the “-ed” portion of past tense. Finally, the word “happen” is another word for “to occur” (which has taken place in the past).<n><br><n><n>

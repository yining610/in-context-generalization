{"text": "1.\n\"Your guess on the fabric cutting on type of seller is incorrect, the correct answer is clothing store.\nClothing store fabric is cut to order. Cutting fabric to order can include cutting patterns and assembling material.\nClothing store employees also sew garments. If the clothing customer can not sew the item the customer buys the clothing. Clothing fabric is always custom made to fit the customer and no items are ever the same. Sewing patterns, custom fitting, and custom sewing are all part of cutting fabrics to order. Custom made clothing fits the customer and not the clothing.\"\n\n1.\n\"Your correct! You have a great train of thought.\nTrains are used as a form of transportation which is a good description of the market. If you were at the market you would be purchasing goods which are made and packaged to be sold. The market would be where you purchase fresh produce and vegetables.\n\nHope this helps :)\"\n\n### Input:\"How did I go about determining who won?\"\n\n\"Your guess on one of the teams winning is incorrect, the correct response is you will see if both teams are evenly matched.\nOne of these questions we have discussed is the comparison between team A and team B. The teams are evenly matched because both teams show signs of equal opportunity. When the teams are evenly matched the outcome of the game is unknown and it will be interesting to see who does win. Weather team A or team B wins is unknown because they do not show over bearing strength in any area of play.\nWith one of these teams it would be interesting that they would win in the area of sportsmanship and the level at which they played is consistent to their play.\nYour guess on one team winning because of sportsmanship is incorrect, the correct guessing is which team won.\nThe reason that which team won is correct is there are different questions on competing in a sporting event. The winning is the outcome of the event.\nThe competing questions were in the past or which team won this event.\nHope this helps\"\n### Input:What do people do at a bookstore?\n\n\"In the instruction you will find out what people do at a book store and you should answer this question correctly.

An example would be: He always goes to the market to buy chickens for his family. This means that he is going to the market to look for chickens to buy and is not trying to sell chickens.

Fabric is cut to the specific dimensions and is tailored to meet the exact needs of a specific client.\n\n#### \u2b55\ufe0f B: Tailor shop\n\nTailors specialize in altering and mending clothing, which is the process of improving upon previously existing styles and materials.

A tailor does not work exclusively with new items of clothing, they also alter previously used clothing with the intent to improve it.\n\n#### \ud83d\udeab C: Clothing store\n\nA clothing store has a wide variety of clothing items for different individuals to choose from. Clothing stores do not cater more towards individual preferences; they simply have a wide selection of styles and sizes to choose from. A clothing store allows you to shop and try on clothing without paying any extra for the alterations necessary to improve upon your new garment.\n\n#### \u2642\ufe0f D: sewing room\n\nSewing is the process of joining two fabric pieces together to form one. This is done with a variety of specialized machines. Fabric is sewn together to create clothing, linens, bags, and so on. Fabric can be ordered from a tailor if the user wants specific alterations done to the item.\n\n#### \u2640\ufe0f E: hardware store\n\nHardware stores often provide a variety of fabric sewing tools. These include scissors, needles, straight pins, and fabric markers. They do not customize sewing specifically to the individual needs of their customers.\n\n### Next task:\nCreate a table that summarizes a set of variables.

It is not for you to get up in the morning and decide \u201cI feel like a sweater from the rack\u201d. You go into a tailor store and they take your measurements and decide if the color and style are to your liking.

{"text": "The verb \u201csold\u201d indicates that the plate happened to be owned by him. In other words, it happened to him.\n\n### Explanation:\nIn this sentence, the pronoun referring to the plate (it) is not the subject (doe, he, she, etc), which does not change who the subject is (e.g., \u201cThe plate\u2026who was owned by him\u201d as opposed to \u201cThe plate was sold was owned by him.\u201d). The pronoun refers directly back to \u201cthe plate\u201d (he bought), which indicates that \u201che\u201d is \u201cdoing something\u201d to the plate (bought).\n\n### Democracy\n\nAs for the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d the \u201c-cracy\u201d part of the word stands for \u201crule.\u201d The first part of the word, \u201cdemo,\u201d which usually means \u201cpeople,\u201d also denotes the \u201cgovernment\u201d of the people (e.g., the rule of the people.). Together, these parts of the word indicate a system where the people rule or govern.\n\n### Subjective\nThe verb phrase \u201cto happen\u201d is an -ize verb (e.g., happened, building, etc.). As for the past perfect tense (\u201cwhich happened\u2026\u201d), remember this is past tense and the perfect tense (e.g., done, etc.) is the \u201c-ed\u201d portion of past tense. Finally, the word \u201chappen\u201d is another word for \u201cto occur\u201d (which has taken place in the past).\n<br>", "answer": "D: flea market"}

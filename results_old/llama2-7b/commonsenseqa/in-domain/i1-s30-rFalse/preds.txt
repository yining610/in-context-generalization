Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?, Choices:  A: better communication B: overthinking C: frustration D: misunderstandings E: headaches<n><n>### Response:		The person who answered correctly.<n>Given:  <n>Learning languages is painful,  <n>in a full immersion environment, you're most likely to make mistakes,  <n>mistakes result in misinterpretation,  <n>which causes discomfort,  <n>which causes headaches<n><n>Solution:<n>```<n>The sentence can be boiled down to what you learn is painful because you make mistakes. Headaches occur because of those mistakes.

Choices:  _A: eleven, twenty one. B: ten, fifteen._<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>I thought that two numbers, ten and fifteen, make up one thirty because in math, one thirty would be 10 + 15, which equals to one thirty, however that's wrong but then I remember in pre-algebra I used to subtract 10 from 30 I'd get 20 so 10 and 15 would make up ONE THIRTY - it made all the sense in the world. After that little mathematical revelation, I decided to call my friend and have him help me calculate that out using his scientifical, advanced calculator. He was a very helpful friend indeed, I'd be the most well rounded person around if it weren't for that guy. He told me the correct way to get one thirty was 10 + 20, which is correct, I'd never knew that, 10 + 5, 15 + 15, and anything with that logic made no sense, but now I understand it all!

D: Heather sent an appreciative email E: His friends reminded him how far he had come<n><n>### Response :<n>> The team leader's encouraging reminder of everything we have overcome reminded me that we are able to overcome most obstacles thrown at us, and with the help of science and hard work, one day we will be successful in solving this problem.<n><n>###Input:<n>> This sentence makes me think about how much work goes into everything, whether if it's finding the answer or finding the right person. It makes me realize that a lot of things are more complicated than they seem.<n><n>### Response<n><n>> A lot of people make decisions quickly without any research and that's fine. But most people don't realize that their choices can affect their future and their environment. For example, using less plastic is a great way to reduce your environmental impact. You can use a biodegradable or reusable product if you're not sure what to do with your old plastic water bottles. <n><n>The use of fossil fuels is another choice that affects our climate and landfills. We should also be aware of how much food is wasted each year. Using excessive amounts of electricity could also lead to global warming because all electricity comes from the burning of fossil fuels. Even small decisions make a difference when you think about it. For example, think about how much plastic water bottles you've recycled in your lifetime!<n>

Also, you should choose a wood that is soft and light, you do not want to use wood that is heavy and dense. After you select a wood, you can draw the straight line by measuring it and then marking it.<n><n># Step 2: Measure and draw an arch on the side that opposes to the straight line<n>On the other side of your plywood board you need to measure the same length as the one side. After that you will need to mark the 2 straight lines that connects from one side of your board to the other. You should make sure that you have a piece of wood that is soft and evenly spaced.<n><n>#Step3: Measure the distance between the opposing lines of your board<n>After you mark the two lines that cross, you will need to use the remaining board for your measurements. You should also leave some space that is less than 1/2 of your remaining board. After that the board is to be placed so that it is right next to one of the two straight cross pieces.<n><n># Step4: Mark the cross piece of your board using the piece of wood you left at step 3.<n>Mark the cross piece of your plywood board using the board from step 3. You should also leave enough space to fit the remaining board into. If you leave enough space to fit, the remaining block will be able to fit the space that the wood that goes across the two line pieces. After you mark the wood, place the remaining board into the space so that the marking you made aligns to the mark of your board. After marking and placing all four pieces you should be done. Then you are supposed to mark the middle two parallel lines. Mark them between 2 and 4 times larger than the ones you mark at the beginning.<n><n>#Input:<n><n>### A<n><n>### C<n><n>### B<n><n>### D<n>

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Answer: E: better understanding<n><n>### Input:Wanting to avoid the cabbage spoiling, where did he put it? Choices:  A: grocery store B: refrigerator C: freezer D: plate E: supermarket<n><n>### Response:		It would be the most accurate to say he placed the cabbage:<n><n>1. In the refrigerator, on the plate and in the freezer.<n><n>In order to determine from which of the response options, 'cabbage' is referred to, we assume that there is only one choice for 'cabbage' in an answer (as there is for 'do math' or 'enlightened'). Therefore, we must ask ourselves the following question - Which of the words listed above is used only once?<n><n>Answer: It would be the<n><n>1. supermarket<n><n>This is because only 'cabbage' appears in'supermarket' and 'cabbage' can be inferred from'supermarket' if we assume, based on the answer options, that the speaker refers to the verb 'to place'. So, the cabbage would probably be placed somewhere within the supermarket, as the supermarket is often used when referring to a large grocery store. Therefore, there are two possibilities:<n><n>1. The cabbage is in the freezer, which is located within the kitchen.<n><n>2. The cabbage is on the shelf in the vegetable section of the supermarket.<n><n>Now that we know roughly where the cabbage is placed, we can infer whether the scientist placed the cabbage within the supermarket, e.g. in the freezer, or outside, e.g. on a shelf in the vegetables section.<n><n>We can then answer the question by choosing either B (in the freezer) or A (on the supermarket shelf). Both are possible answers, and B is slightly more probable than A, because if the cabbage is in the supermarket, then it follows logically that it would be in the freezer. We infer that the cabbage is not near the sink, because the word sink (which can be inferred from the mention of a cabbage headache) is not mentioned in the answer options and would be unlikely to be the first choice made by the speaker. We also know that the cabbage is certainly not in the grocery store, because the grocery store is not a likely place for grocery items like cabbages to be stored.<n><n><n>> #### 2.<n><n>1. Which of the items below could not be put in the bin? Choices: A: a glass B: a towel C

If the host has not shown up yet, he takes the host's seat but only if it is vacant. Once, when I was at a fancy-dress party, I sat next to a woman because I thought you have to sit with your partner at the same table. This turned out to be a terrible mistake because the women seated across from us was a talkative old lady who kept telling me that she met my parents once at a Christmas party. After about an hour, I switched tables and sat next to my boyfriend so that I can concentrate on enjoying his company instead. This would probably have been the right decision but unfortunately, my girlfriend fell asleep in front of me after a few sips of red wine. Thus, I am left to do all the talking.<n><n>### Input-Answer:<n>How is the answer of this exercise 77% accurate?<n>Input: The question is "When having food at a fancy-dining party, what do you usually...?"<n><n>Answer: "A: sit B: being social D: drinking C: talk E: medium."

It has spent all of its money and has no capital to lend out to other companies or clients. A business becomes bankrupt when it can no longer pay its debts/loans. Bankruptcy is a legal term that means the business has lost all money and is not able to pay its debts. To solve this problem, the company files documents at the court to announce his/her/its bankruptcy. If the court thinks that the company is actually bankrupt they will put an end to the company and let it shut down.<n>

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Answer: E: better understanding<n><n>### Input:People want to explore space, so what should they use to do it? Choices:  A: public place B: roadblock C: space shuttle D: hoverboard E: supermarket<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I found that my solution to this problem didn't need to be too complicated or time consuming. It involved simply providing the right kind of input in the right format. <n><n><n>#### First Steps:<n><n>Given that the answer to this question is “E: better understanding”, I needed to first determine what part of this answer I needed to focus on. This led me to take a step back and start the process of analysis and synthesis of the problem. For example, with questions that have similar answers, I found that the question might not have been correctly interpreted as the answer is quite broad. I will demonstrate this by analyzing the other answers given to this question so that we may have a better sense of what the task’s answer may be.<n><n>- What are the answers given in this multiple choice question?<n><n>- **Option ‘A:’ What do we get if we remove ‘the’ from this question?**<n><n>  My answer: ‘Learn more about’ is a bit of a confusing way to put it as there are many ways to learn more about something so I think the correct sentence would be ‘do learn more about’<n><n>- **Option B: Is headache an unsuitable answer for this question?**<n> <n>  My answer: Yes, I would say so. I don’t believe headache is a suitable answer for this question because I am unsure why the question asks what kind of analysis is done if it’s about a scientist doing an analysis himself.<n><n>- **Option C: Why is ‘space shuttle’ considered inappropriate as an answer?**<n><n>  What I found is that space shuttle refers to a vehicle, and from the title of the question, it doesn’t seem to refer to astronauts or other space ships but rather a lab results. So I concluded that space shuttle as an answer to the question is wrong because ‘Space shuttle’ refers to a vehicle so it doesn’t make sense to include this word in the context of exploring space. <n><n>- **Option D: Why is hoverboard an inappropriate answer choice?**<n><n>  As far as I can tell, hoverboard is not what’s being asked about in the problem thus I think hoverboard is an inappropriate choice.<n><n>- **Lastly, why is E: better understanding correct as an answer

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Answer: E: better understanding<n><n>### Input:What is a person likely to feel when they are abandoned by everyone after they stop being married to someone else? Choices:  A: grief B: solo C: isolation D: pleasure E: happiness<n><n>### Response:		<n>What is a person likely feel after being abandoned by their former partner can be different according to many factors one can be they do not have friends close to them,another is that they don't have any money to get to their house, the question does not tell us exactly why someone may feel this because we were not given any information about the person and his friends, the other reasons that we get from the question is that he may feel abandoned because he may have lost his job that enabled him to buy the house,so he does not rent it because he does not have the money to pay for it, I think that some of the possible reasons that someone may feel like this is not the only one it's just some that I can think of maybe there is others.<n><n>### Comments:<n>- First, I'm worried that we're not going to receive enough specifics to write our answers. We're going to need to make judgements that will affect the answers.<n>- I also think that the questions will be very tricky. They are in a way. "What is a person likely think..." I'm worried if we don't have the right answer to what's going to happen, we're going to be wrong. I think it could be possible to answer correctly to the question, but the answer may contradict what was going to happen in the next question.<n><n>## Reflection<n>I found that this course is a little different from the last few ones we have taken but still we can use the previous ones when we think we need help. It's important to not give the exact answer but try to explain the best answer you can.<n>The one thing that surprised me in this course is how it can be different from some other online courses, it's better than some.I think it's better to talk about every question or information we need to get help from someone or try to solve it with the information we received. It also depends on what we have been given.<n><n>### Constructive feedback for peers<n><n>- In response to the second question, it's important to find the reason for why someone may feel the way they do<n>- It's also important to give examples to strengthen the answer<n>- To the last question it's equally important to do this, give examples as well as explain what they are<n><n>### Conclusion<n>In conclusion there are many benefits to learning with

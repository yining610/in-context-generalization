They were in the development stages of creating humanoid robots that are able to be used by humans as regular workers. Gem has recently finished the process of assembling 3 humanoid robots to the best of her abilities.<n><n>All robots are tested and found to be in proper working condition. The robots have various different skill sets, and abilities.<n><n>---<n><n>In this task, you will need to write code to be able to create a simple interface for Gem to work on these robots.<n><n>For this task you will be creating a class for each of the 3 robots that should be able to be called in by the "main" class. Each of the robots should be able to set their power, turn on and off, and display a message to the user.<n><n>In addition to the "main" class, you will need to create a class that will create a GUI, and allow Gem to interact with the robots via this GUI.<n><n>When she interacts with the GUI, she may set power to one of the robots, turn each of the robots on or off, ask what a robot "displayMessage" and interact with each robot based upon their skillset.<n><n>For example, if "Gem:" asks the robot named "Robot" what message the robot is displaying, and "Gem:" interacts by turning on "Robot," or setting power, and asking for the message again, she should get the same result as if the robot had said nothing, or nothing had changed.<n><n>This means that any action she interacts with should produce a result that cannot be altered by the class containing the robots when they are set in the GUI.<n><n>Additionally, if the robots "reset" or Gem turns herself off, she must be able to interact with this reset, using the reset methods on the robots and GUI classes, and get her initial result.<n><n>---<n>### How to Solve:<n><n>- Create several classes that can be interacted with by gem.<n>- Included are "robots" and "GUI."<n>- Create main class that interacts with other classes.<n>- Robots class to set skill, and turn on or off.<n>- GUI class to set the view of robots.<n>

Choices:  A: the sun B: catch cold C: prepare to go D: feel humiliated E: hunt for food<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Read the following code.<n><n>### Code Listing:<n>```<n>    function startApp() {<n>      console.clear();<n>      showPrompt("Please enter your PIN", function showPIN(p) {<n>        if (validatePIN(p)) {<n>          showLogin();<n>        } else {<n>          showPrompt("Invalid PIN (try again)", function showLogin(p) {<n>            if (validatePIN2(p)) {<n>              showAlert("Login successful");<n>            } else {<n>              showInvalidPin();<n>            }<n>          });<n>        }<n>      });<n>    }<n>```<n><n>### Instructed Task:<n>If we are to test the code above for all possible scenarios, what should be executed in order?<n><n>### Instincts:<n>Test all possible scenarios in order<n><n>### Instant:<n>The main goal of this program is to authenticate an user by entering their pin, which should either work or fail. The program is also designed to give clues that can guide a user. If a user succeeds, they should get an alert as well as get redirected to a login screen. If a user fails, he should be given a chance to try again. Every choice on the screen should be related in a way that the program is working. For the main code, there are some conditional statements that need to verify if the input is an int or not. For this scenario, I'll have to test if the input is an integer, which is 0 - 9. If it is, it should be used. If it isn't, an alert is to be displayed and not executed. For the first case, there's a function that is being called on every scenario: showLogin(). This function needs to be tested whether it's working or not. To reach the case where the function executes, three conditions need to be verified. The first one is the inputted pin. If the inputted pin is not a working one, an invalid pin should be returned which results to a fail. If the inputted PIN is a working PIN, a "Login successful" alert should be displayed. For the testing, I'll have a conditional statement:<n><n>```<n>    console.log("Invalid PIN (please try again): " + p);<n>    if (validateP

What does this mean, when the author said "the car in the city seemed like more trouble than it was worked, the man still had walk out to the" I had a hard time finding a word that fit in this sentence. I looked in the dictionary for it and could not find the word. So I went with the word "trouble" since it was right after "walk".<n><n>## My Questions:<n>What do they want me to know?

Look up the unknown word and try to figure out the meaning that is provided for me. If it does not make sense, read the sentence again. If the sentence still does not make sense, look up the synonyms or antonyms for the words.<n>

Answers given to this question include hardware retails such as Home Depot, clothing stores like JC Penney, sporting goods stores like Nike, department stores such as Macy’s, and electronic shops like Best Buy. But chords or cords can also be used in music to produce certain sounds. Chords can also be written as two or more notes that sound pleasing to the ear such as C major.<n><n>In the response given, the student attempted to give an answer that they thought made most sense. The response chosen was about music stores and other locations that retail musical products such as musical instruments.

That is a water fountain, you do need a water fountain to be the water it gives. You might not need a fountain on a ship or one that runs on electricity. You can find water fountains most anywhere like an office building, theater, supermarkets, church, school, cafeteria, and hospital, just to name a few. If you find any of these places they should have a water fountain. They are not in all places of course but you should find them in most places.

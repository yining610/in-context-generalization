Read the description: The room was dark. There (1: dark, 2: dark place) was no light at all.\n2. The question is \"What did he see?\" So, the answer has to be: 1. what he saw\n2. the answer can come from what he saw or heard or whatever.  (2: whatever)\n3. The answer for this answer (2) can be made by 1. what he said (3: what he said) and 2. what he saw and (3: what did he see) from the description \" The room was dark.  (4: dark) There (6: there) was no light at al (in) (7: it)ll \"\n4. The other answers can be eliminated by doing:\n\n1. the answer cannot be an object because the question has \"he saw\"\n2. the answer cannot be the room because if any object was seen, the description says he saw it, he saw the dark.

First look at the question and focus on comprehending it: the question is about hosting a dinner and the capacity of the kitchen.\n2. Start by looking at all the choices individually:\n    * A: \"Bigger\" doesn't really make sense in the context of a kitchen, so it can't be the chosen word.\n    * B: \"Larger\" can be the answer if 5 is a reasonable number of people to host, and you want to be able to host more people in the future.\n    * C: \"More\" could be interpreted as either of the above answers, so it isn't a relevant word.\n    * D: \"Full\" means entirely filled, like a full plate or a full day.\n    * E: \"Fuller\" could potentially work, but we don't actually know the intended meaning of the question, so we can't go with this either.\n3. To figure out the answer, use process of elimination to determine which of the answer choices do not fit the criteria. \n    * None of them is the same as \"full\", like D and E.\n    * None of the options are about how large the kitchen is, like A and B.\n    * None say that the kitchen is good for having a lot of people over, like C.\n    * Finally, using C to decide between E and D, E is \"fuller\", but the point of the question is to use another word than \"full\".

The smell is a nuisance but not a threat to your health and it does not change the way how the printer functions. So, this can be ruled out as one of the answers. \n2. The cost is prohibitive for many. But that is not an immediate issue with most 3D printers, the machine runs but slowly. \n3. The 3D printer is dangerous if it's not properly operated. So, we assume the machine is properly operated and the danger is ruled out. \n4 & 5. We will combine both and focus on the main drawback as maintains a 3D printer uses more energy. The key difference is that this problem is more immediate and can render the printer useless.\nTherefore, the most critical problem is with maintaining the 3D printer.\nAnswer: D, C, A\n\nInput: Which of these sounds best to a woman in distress?

Star chart is a map or schematic with the different constellations shown; it's related to the stars appearing in that chart. \n2. The choices provided represent various things about the star chart, however, not all of them directly relate to its main focus: how stars appear. Only 'name','size', and 'brightness' relate to the appearance of the star chart.\n3. If the star chart is naming or listing the stars, it will more likely highlight the stars than their appearance.

Her best friend helps her how? Choices: 1. A: with a calculator test 2. B: with a practice test 3. C: by grading her answers 4. D: by reteaching her the math 5. E: by helping her improve her answers\nRationales: Start by reading the question. The question states that her friend helps but there's a doubt about whether the answers are right. \nNext, think about how the choices relate to the question. Evaluate whether each choice could make the student more likely to get the desired score. \nBased on that evaluation, make a choice.\nRationale 1:  First, let's see what a calculator test is. The test is something a teacher does to help students practice using a calculator. A student can only get a calculator test if a teacher issues an extra request. It's unlikely that a student's best friend would have a calculator test on hand. Hence, the answer is A.\nRationale 2: Practice tests let a student prepare for a real test by taking similar kinds of questions. However, a practice test can't guarantee a perfect score, as the student might use a calculator incorrectly, or other kinds of mistakes could come up. A practice test can't reteach the math, and it might be difficult or impossible for a student's bestie to grade the test. A practice test won't improve the answers.

Therefore, one can eliminate possibilities D, E.\n2. Further consider the remaining choices: waterfall, ocean, woods.\n3. Woods: a forest or a thicket of trees are not a likely choice for a frog to rest at since these options provide areas with too much cover to the extent that the frog may not be able to reach its prey well enough.\n4. Ocean: the ocean is where fish dwell and this isn't what frogs eat.\n5. Waterfall: the waterfall may provide a suitable habitat based on how much it falls and whether or not the water is strong enough to enable a frog to move around. Further consider whether these factors may also provide enough obstacles to the frog's ability to forage, and whether it has an adequate food source.\n6. There are several factors to consider for the frog and these are too specific to be made explicit. However, the information provided in the prior paragraph clearly indicates that the frog's hunting capabilities are limited and it may be unable to catch much food or to hunt for a long length of time.

It could suggest that the person should have planned ahead with provisions, perhaps by storing up food.\n7. It could also suggest that the person will leave a certain situation and go in search of food, while staying away from the source that was previously keeping them hungry.\n8. \"Thank god\" is another vague option, as \"god\" is a faith term, which may not be relevant to the neolithic person.\n9. Finally, \"prepare to go\" is a weaker option than \"hunt for food\" because it doesn't mention that the person will find and eat food.\n10. Given that \"hunt for food or prepare to go\" are the only two available options, the stronger choice is \"Prepare to Go.\" \n11. Prepare to go is the only option available which directly addresses the situation of someone who is hungry. The other options make up the weaker option \"prepare to go\" by only suggesting that the person go hunting or go in search of food. \n12.

Choices A: report B: statement C: prediction D: rumor E: review\nRationales: Start by noting that this is a statement with the word \"sometime\" as the qualifier. So, when is sometime today, this year 2015? The movies of 2014 are no longer new, so \"today\" is presumably the \"today\" of 2015.\n\nFurther, it's easy to see that the movie itself will not premiere, for that would still be in the future. Rather, the author predicts that a movie released in 2014 will premier at some point that day, presumably when people are actually watching movies in theaters.\n\nNext, examine the given choices. The best choice is a review, since this is the only conclusion that fits our information and is supported by the text as a whole.\n\nNote that the options do not include movies in their titles, so a review of a movie is not explicitly required (although the text seems to imply that the chosen movie is important).\n\nTherefore, the answer is E with no hesitation.\nAnswer: E review\n\nThe key to figuring out questions like these is to read carefully. Notice that a movie is not mentioned in the prompt. What happens to the movie is inferred. The author of the prompt is obviously speaking of the movie that won an Oscar for Best Picture in 2015, as many other movies were released in 2005 and there is no time limitation. The author is merely congratulating the winner and explaining the criteria for the award. The statement is also very informative.

The only ones that match this are A) and B), because they are the only ones that talk about students' actions. All of the others are about what students are ACTING/HAVING/DOING. The next part of the question: \"When they're having those discussions during their lessons?\" \"having\" is a gerund, so it also has to be present progressive.

The patient had a headache, so the doctor was asked about the possible cause by the patient.\nThe question then provides four options along with the term \"your headache\".\nThe options given are either \"dehydration\", \"meningitis\",\"allergic reaction\", or \"bacterial sinus infections\".\nThe options \"dehydrations\" and \"meningitis\" are diseases, whereas \"allergic reaction\" and \"bacterial sinuses infection\" are conditions.\nThe doctor is more than likely to say \"dehydrated\", \"meningitis\", or \"bacteria sinus infection\" when asked about the causes of another person's headache.\nThe options \"allergic reaction\" and \"tension\" are not diseases or conditions, which means the doctor isn't likely to list them as potential causes of headaches.\nHence, to find the correct answer, the options that are mentioned in the question are compared with each other.\nDehydration is not mentioned in the question, as the patient's headache is not caused by lack of hydration, as dehydration will lead to vomiting and abdominal cramping, whereas the patient's symptoms do not appear to align with any of these symptoms.

What does the word \"tole\" mean? Choices: 1. 1. A: bear B: suffer C: last D: resist E: give\nRationales:\n1. Start by understanding that the word tole means \"to bear\" or \"to endure\" and is therefore, the answer choice \"to bear\" is incorrect because the question asks \"What does the word tole mean?\" and the answer choice \"tole\" means \"to bear\".\n2. In addition, the other answer choices are likely incorrect for this question.\n3. First looking at choice'suffer' means one is under stress or pain, which is not the most accurate depiction of what the word 'tole means' nor is it a related definition of the word.\n4. Similarly, choice'resist' means to counter by force, which is more indicative of a person \"fighting back\" than simply \"enduring\", which is what \"tole\" means in this context.\n5. Choosing 'last' is inaccurate because it means continuing into the future, which might indicate a time horizon of bearing a thing, but does not accurately depict the idea of enduring without any changes.\n6. Lastly, the answer is 'to bear' (D) with the word 'tole' (D) meaning 'to endure'.\n7.

Do you know what the river is? Choices: 1. A river of blood 2. the blood of a person 3. the river 4. nope A: the river B: a river 5. nope 6. nope C:  river\nRationales: Consider the first line of the question, which says there is a line in a  poem that says 'The  river's always flowi'\".  \nFrom this, we know that the river is being used figuratively as the  metaphor for something that is always happening.\n1. First, considering the options that are real. In a poem, a river must be flowing.  Hence, options 1 and 6 are incorrect.\n2. The second option is also incorrect. Blood will not be flowing in the river.  When thinking of the literal meaning of flowing, we would need to consider the second part of the poetic line.\n3. Option 2 is incorrect as it is not a river, but the blood of a person.\n4. Finally, Option 3 is the correct answer. The third option refers to a literal river that is flowing.\nAnswer: B- A river\n\nInput: A small bird is an adult's pet. It's an ovenbird, how long do they live in the wild?

Choices:   A: trying to kill B: behaving C: going crazy B: going nuts D: being mad E: raving\nRationales: As per the clue, you can see that the options available which don't make sense, are being mad or raving. These terms do not mean what the question demands. But out of the remaining options, trying to kill may be a wrong option since the next phrase hints that he is trying to kill himself, which clearly suggests that he is not insane.\nAn insane person may behave as if he were nuts.

To understand this question, it is important to focus on what the question asks. The question is concerned with the doctor's concern about the patient.\n2. So look at the various options and determine which is most closely related to the concern.\n3. For example, it's unlikely that'mental health' would have anything to do with 'hearing' or 'breath'.\n4. It's also unlikely that the doctor would be worried about the patient's 'balance' or 'eyesight', as these could be treated with medication or other methods.\n5. The only remaining options are 'balance', 'hearing', and'mental health'.\n6. To determine which choice most fits the context, we need to focus on the doctor's concern.

Choices: A: eat the same thing B: make a small portion C: bake for a party D: exercise E: watch the diet\nRationales: Process of elimination. As Sam loves to eat 'everyday', the answer must be something she does consistently; if she eats a new food every day for a week, this activity or task would not be related to her general preference of eating.\nSo looking at the given options: Sam is not an exercise enthusiast. Eating small portions implies the opposite of liking to eat, and eating different foods does not apply to the context that Sam loves to eat and eat anything she can get her hands on.\nThus, the best option is D: exercise.

Choices:  cook it in a pan B: use it as a tool to cook the steak C: sear it on the stove D: flip it over E: put it in the refrigerator to store for later\nRationales: In order to answer this question, it's worth looking at the different ways people use an iron (besides its primary function as a tool for pressing clothes).\n1. Using it to cook food -  an iron could potentially be used to sear a steak on the stove top, but it would not be the optimal choice. \n2. Using it to store food -  this is not the intended purpose of an iron. \n3. The least appropriate use of an irons is to use it as a tool, and in particular, to cook a steak on the grill.

Choices:  A. bilingual B. fluent C. bilingual D. bilingual E. fluent\nRationales: The first step is to understand what this means. The word bilingual is defined by dictionary apps as \"capable of speaking two languages or using two languages.\" This would imply that people who are bilingual are able to communicate in two languages.\nThe other option in the question, fluent, which is referred to as the opposite of bilingual, can also be broken down. Fluent means \"proficient in speaking a language\", which would make it a subset of bilingual. Since \"can speak two languages\" is what the word refers to, if someone says that the people who can speak foreign language are bilingual, they are also speaking fluent.\nHence, the correct answer is A.\n\nInput: One of the ways to do something well is to do it more often. So what does the speaker call a \"superstar\"? Choices:  A.. one who doesn\u2019t try hard enough B: person who tries hard C: one who doesn\u2019t have enough time D: person who tries his best in everything E: person who has a very busy schedule\nRationales: In this question, both the word superstar and the phrase one who doesn't try hard enough are used. Understanding the definition of the former can help with understanding the latter.\nIn the dictionary definition of superstar, a star who appears in movies, plays, or the media is referred to as a superstar. However, the definition refers to a star who does well in all aspects of play or television as a superstar.\nConsequently, the phrase one who doesn\u2019t don't try hard enough is referring to being a superstar in a certain context, which makes sense because one who does try their hardest is a superstar in their field.\nHence, answer A.\n\nInput:\"Everyone's favorite teacher is the kind of person who inspires students to great things,\" the speaker says.

Choices: 1) A: Excitement 2) B: Annoyance 3) C: Lack of Confidence 4) D: Satisfaction 5) E: Exasperation\nRationales: Let us first analyze the choice of emotions, as a fourteen-year-old cannot have all the emotions together.\n\n1. Excitement occurs when someone is anticipating happy or positive events. We feel excited when good things are about to happen; it is a positive emotion.\n2. Annoyance results from frustration and dissatisfaction. It is a feeling of displeasure or discontent.\n3. Lack of Confidence is lack of self-assurance, typically resulting from a lack of belief in one\u2019s own ability. It is not a positive emotion and is opposite of satisfaction.\n4. Satisfaction is a state of fulfillment and pleasure when some kind of desired goal has been achieved. Hence, satisfaction involves gaining a wanted object or outcome.\n5. Exasperation is a strong feeling of anxiety, annoyance, and despair. It is usually seen after a lot of annoying and unpleasant things happen.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D: Satisfaction.\n\nInput: This morning I'll do ____, then ____ and then I'll go to the pool.

Choices: A: look forward to D: fear B: like C: dread E: hate\nRationales: There are 3 concepts which apply to this question:\n1. 'tax' can imply an amount of money to be paid on behalf of some service provided, such as government support or to regulate one's activity.\n2. 'taxes' could refer to the government collecting revenue in order to pay for specific services such as schools or roads.\n3. 'the taxman' can mean the authority which administers or receives payments on behalf of a government.\n4. These concepts can be illustrated by the choices provided which are as follows:\n- A 'look forward to': this choice suggests that people don't mind paying taxes, but they don't mind payments in general, which isn't the context of the question.\n- B 'like': this option can be related to certain kinds of taxes, like a toll for using the highway.

A: departmental store 2. B: mall 3. C: shopping center 4. D: plaza 5. E: big store\nRationales: This question is asking to which category this type of location can belong. It is important to notice that mall can refer to a space that has several different stores where it is possible to find clothing, shopping, etc. or a place with one main big area where this is the exclusive purpose.\nThe following options refer to different types of locations with a specific purpose like food, shopping center refers exclusively to this purpose. Food can also be found in malls, but does include the possibility of finding other things.\n\nStep 1: Shopping center. This option refers to a place where it is possible to buy other things besides food.\n\nStep 2: Shopping center is the correct answer. This is because the mall is defined as a place made for shopping and in shopping centers people can buy more than just clothes or shoes.\nInput: The problem in question is to find a location where it is possible to do shopping, food, and find clothing and shoes.\nThese items are exclusively given in the options, where it is important to notice that shopping can only be found in a shopping center.

That would be a sign that you've made an incorrect assumption.\nThe second rule of this question type, is a reminder that, in general, sweat production can rise above normal levels for a number of things. For instance, exercising, an underlying heart condition, and stress can all result in a spike in sweat production, which in itself does not necessarily identify a problem, until you can eliminate other options of course.\nThis question is not like those kinds of questions, we don't need to worry about the other factors, it's just a plain, straightforward question of what sweating can signify - as such we don't need any other factors, we're just dealing with a one-dimensional understanding here.\nWhat else would be an indication of how a body feels is that there's an underlying issue causing the increase in sweat?\nThere are not any other specific things you can use as a signal that there is a problem.

The group of women is talking about a movie they watched recently. One of the women, however, has never seen any classic movies ever. \nNext, the question asks the group which they like \"better.\" We can eliminate choice A as they must all like to go to movies, either new, classic, or older.  Choice C is excluded because they have already seen what they want, so choice is excluded. \nChoice B can be eliminated because the woman who has never seen a classic movie would not drink either. That is why we are only considering choices D and E. \nIn D we are left with'seeing new movies'. However, \"better\" here seems to mean more liked, not better in terms of quality, but better in terms of experience. \nIn view of these two choices, it seems like E has the best fit with \"better\" as experienced \"better\" cannot be applied to all things.

{"text": "fits the context is D: sleep, as the person is neolithic, they are not modern and would not have access to food or options to easily obtain food, thus it was likely that a neolithc person would just sleep to survive.\n5. However, when looking only at these options, the other options can all be reasonable and appropriate solutions and thus any answer could be correct.\n6. To differentiate the options, the context given the hungry neolithic person must be considered: they can't just get food immediately as they don't have modern access to food available to them, they can't thank god given they are part of an early human society who may or may not even believe in gods, they can't feel humiliated or else their entire society would collapse, and they can't just prepare to go due to a lack of knowledge about the outdoors and the ability to even find a path to food.\n7. Therefore sleep comes from a logical deduction from the context, so the only correct answer is sleep.\nAnswer: D; sleep\n\nInput: The old man is sitting near the bar at the corner.

He could even attack someone or start a bar fight. He does not need to do anything physical and has many options to cause attention at the bar.\nTherefore the best answer is B: something bad is more likely to happen to him.

Preying on livestock would alleviate hunger but wouldn't solve the problem of having to go find the food in the first place.\n6. To go to would be a solution to the problem.\n7. However, \"sleep,\" though it may solve hunger when coupled with another activity, does not directly address going to obtain food.\n8.

Choices:  E: you wanted to get her mind off it\nRationales: Start by looking at the two choices: 1. \"You wanted to get her mind on it.\" 2. \"E\", as in \"You wanted to get Linda's mind off it\". Notice that the context does not reference specific people but people in general.\n\nNext, choose Option E, \"You wanted to get everyone's mind off it,\" for the following reasoning:\n\nLinda doesn't understand a movie so the other people don't know how to interpret it either: 1. The movie didn't mean anything in particular. 2. This is why Linda didn't get it: it wasn't supposed to. \nFinally, the person who mentioned this movie to Linda did not want to force Linda to watch the movie, but rather to give Linda another outlet: 1. You wanted Linda to watch the other movie with you instead: \"The other movie made my mind on it.\" \nNow, move on to Option A, \"You wanted to make Linda's mind on it.\"  You didn't want Linda to watch the film you had taken her to. This is why: 1. The word \"on\" refers to something being directed at. 2. You didn't want to tell Linda to stop obsessing about the first movie and watch the other film instead. \nThe correct option is E, or \"You wanted to get everybody's minds off [the first movie].\"\nAnswer: E: you wanted to give them something to think about\n\nInput: What do astronauts have to do every day?

Choices:  O: redecorate B: modernize C: remodel D: renovate E: repaint\nRationales: Steps:\nStep 1: understanding the question. The question asks for ways to make homes look new.\nStep 2: identifying the role of options provided. the options given involve the aspects of home decoration that relate to a home's appearance and visual perception.\nStep 3. After analysis of provided options, it is now possible to deduce that option C' \"remodel\" refers to making substantial alterations to the home such that it transforms from an old to a new appearance and design.\nStep 4. Evaluation of the rest of options and context of question then reveals that options A\"redecorate\", B \"modernize\", D \"renovate\", and E \"repaint\"  do not offer substantial transforming changes, which is necessary for a home to look new.\nStep5. Hence, option C is most appropriate as there are no substantial alterations to the way the home looks, and the home is still referred to as old.

It can also mean 'thick, short, stubby' as in big and stocky. In each scenario these words refer to a'size'.\nOption B: Pointy means 'having the form of a point as in an arrowhead or needle.'\nOption C: Boxy means 'having a square shape like a box' and as such is not likely to describe the style of the gentleman's footwear.\nOption D: Square means 'having four sides which are at right angles (90 degrees angles) to each other' so it's not likely to describe the gentleman's foot-wear either.\nOption E: Flat can mean 'level with something,' but it can also mean 'to level or make level' so doesn't seem to apply to the style of the gentleman in question.\nAfter we understand each option, let's begin evaluating which choice is likely.

It gets everything clean and keeps plates and glasses sanitized for the next time you use them again. 2. It does the dishes so you don't have to wash your hands and risk spreading germs everywhere like on your guests. 3. It cuts the amount of time you have to stand around talking. \nRationales:1. First, read the question. Why is a dish washer great for parties is the question. \n2. Consider whether party is defined or not. \"Party\" doesn't have to be limited to one specific thing, so it could be any social gathering like a potluck dinner or a cocktail party too.\n3. The answer choice needs to be related to the idea that the dishwasher is great for parties.\n4. Next, look over the answers. Each one has a different context. The first answer talks about how the dishwashing machine keeps the dishes clean and sanitized. When you wash using a dish washing tool, the dishes need more cleaning and rinsing afterward, which could have led to germs growing on them. Since the dish washing machine can clean dishes and also keep them sanitized, it's great for parties.\n5. The second answer talks about how it saves you from having lots of germs in your hand that may spread to other people. This is not really a reason that can be said for the dishwashers.\n6. The third answer talks about how dishwashing machines reduce the amount of time you sit around and chit-chat. This also is not really a reason.\n7. The fourth answer is the best. It talks about how parties are a social gathering where a lot of people sit together and talk about things, and a dishwashing system can help prevent germs, so there's less cleaning required.

Choices:  Yes, No, A: yes, it depends, B: probably not, C: no, D: yes, E: no\nRationales: The context of the situation doesn't matter. When a student takes a test, the most crucial part is to show their thought process. Showing the work is what makes the most significant difference between a grade of 5 and some other grade.\n1. The context of the situation is important to the question since if the answer to the question of if it is okay to not show your work, it is essential to take the test in the correct context.\n2. The only choice that can be answered correctly is choice A that states that \"yes, it depends.\"\n3. The other choices C, D, and E are wrong because they describe the situation with a negative connotation, which might include if showing all your work would lower your score.

Another station, B. A better job, C. A new friend, and D. To try and fixing my car.\n\nFinally, the last remaining option is E.

His supervisor had given him B.  B is what? Choices: B: an idea X C: experiment X D: procedure X E: theory X\nRationales: The sentence reads, \"The scientist was tired and he wanted to get his results\".\nNow look at the choices:\n1. 'X' stands for something that can be done for the purpose of getting results. \n2. \"B\" is a procedure, as in \"B, a procedure\", \"B is a procedure.\"\n3. \"D\" is a procedure, \"B is a procedure...., D is a procedure.\n4. \"E\" is a theory, \"B is a......, E is a theory.\"\n5. \"C\" is an experiment.

Choices: 1: She would probably be in denial. 2: She would ignore it. 3: She would get very upset. 4: It would never make a difference. 5: Sally would go buy new ones.\nRationales: Here are some guidelines for answering this question:\n\nFirst, understand the situation.  We know from the question that Sally is a very organised person.\n\nSecond, examine the options. For each of them, consider the type of reaction it's likely to provoke in Sally.\n\nOption 1: Denial is a reaction where someone pretends or ignores a problem rather than trying to solve it and acknowledging that there is one.  So we know that is probably the wrong answer.\n\nOption 2: Ignoring a problem does not really require an emotional response. Instead, it is just avoidance behaviour. It's not likely to be how Sally reacts to a poorly organised cupboard.\nOption 3: It is reasonable to expect that being disorganised would upset Sally.  However, it's also likely that she would try to remedy the situation rather than become very upset.\nOption 4: For most situations, getting upset isn't likely to solve much. We can also assume Sally is a reasonable and pragmatic person, so she probably wouldn't do that either.\n\nOption 5: If Sally was going to buy new cupboards, it is likely to be because she was moving home or something similar, which would not have anything to do with how messy her existing cupboards were.\nSo the answer is Option 4\nAnswer: 4: She would get very emotional. \n\nThe question is a typical multiple choice question where one has to choose the most appropriate response that is offered in each case of scenarios presented.\n\nIn the first paragraph of the question, the reader would know that John performed a thorough examination.\nIn the following paragraph, John was given to perform a per", "answer": "E: happen anywhere"}

The man was in the shower, which is in the bathroom. He was in the bathroom and the door opened, not the swimming pool.\n2. \"His housemates\" are people who live close by and share an apartment, so this choice is too general.\n3. The ex lover has not appeared in the story yet, so this choice is wrong.\n4. The burglar is a stranger that wants to steal from him, but the man was taking a bath and had nothing to steal so the burglar did not come.\n5. The dog might be the burglar's or the man's, but we can't assume so, so this choice doesn't fit.\n6. The right answer is Option C: His ex looter. He can appear at any moment. He will be an answer that can change the question. He has appeared, so he doesn't have to wait.\n7.

The choices are 'loud,' 'unpleasant,' 'impatient,' 'impolite,' and 'untrustworthy.' We can rule out those that are not associated with people we do not like.\n1. 'Loud' sounds right, but isn't associated with bosses.\n2. 'Unpleasant' is associated with bosses in our experience but, in this case, 'bossy' would not refer to a boss who is unpleasant.\n3. 'Impatient,' 'impolit\u00e9,' and 'untruth' are also incorrect.\n4. Bossy people are not known for being loud, unpleasant, impatient, or untrustworthy.\n5. This leaves us with 'bossy' because they are similar in meaning to bossy.\n6. Furthermore, the answer to our question is 'we don't like boring people.'

Choices:  a: physical strength b: balance c: agility d: grace e: flexibility\nRationales: Start by analyzing the whole question. The question describes the giraffe as having a long body.\n2. They then ask about a benefit of it being long. 3. Finally, they list several options as possible advantages of a long body.\n4. Evaluate each of the listed elements and choose the one that most accurately describes the answer to the question. \n5. Considering the way the question is asked, the option most likely to be the reason for a long body to exist seems to be the benefit of physical strength.\n6. This is because 'physical strength' relates to a long body by its ability to exert force, which would in turn help maintain a large body.\n7. In comparison, the options 'physical balance', 'physical agility', 'physical grace', 'physical flexibility', 'balance', and 'grace' are not related to being able to exert force. \n8. Similarly, the option 'flexibility' which is about bending and stretching, is not directly related either.\n9. Hence the answer is B: physical strength.

Therefore, 'hunt for food' is the correct answer, as the neolithic person likely hunted for food to alleviate hungerness. \nAnswer: Hunt For Food.\n\nInput: A dog is running free,  what are a few good places to take it for a walk in the evenings? Choices:  a: lake b: park with a creek c: hiking trail d: field e: forest\nRationales: Option A - Lake - is the only choice that specifies nighttime. Since a field, a forest or a park likely have other animals, the dog wouldn't be as safe. Neither the field nor the forest would be pleasant for the human to walk alone, without other humans.\nOption D - hiking trail - suggests that the hiker has company, which may not be a great option for the dog if it's unfamiliar or undisciplined. It is unlikely that the humans walking the hiking trail would carry a leash for the dog to walk upon. The hiking trail would be a beautiful location to explore as a human, but is not the best setting for the dog's enjoyment or safety.\nOption E - forest - may not have enough space for a dog to be free; it may be difficult for the dog to navigate properly, and the forest may even be unsafe for the dog. However, if space permits, the forest may be a fun place to explore. However, the hiker and the dog may find other animals or predators to worry about.\nOption B - park with a creek: It would depend on where it was located, a park with a creek may be too dangerous to let the dog wander. A dog may be attracted to drinking water, but it might also be attracted by wildlife. A better option may be a lake, where both the hiker and the hiker's dog can enjoy themselves, at a distance away from other people and animals.\nOption C - Hiking trail: Some hiking trails are not built for dogs. Even if the hiker had a leash, the hiker will have to be a very strong walker in order for the hiker and the walker to make it through their adventure together. The walker wouldn't have fun by themselves, and the dog", "answer": "A: cash register"}

Choices:  A a. don't eat on the street B b. wear your shoes into the mall C c. wear your shoes on the sidewalks D d. don't talk with your mouth full E e. take your shoes off at restaurants\nRationales: A \"good example\" is not defined, so it is not essential that a situation be specifically from Roman times, nor that it have resulted in an actual law, though these would contribute to the situation's example nature.\n1. Answers:\n2. Start by understanding that \"do as the Romans do\" is a saying which suggests that visitors should adopt the customs and manners of the people whom they are visiting, not their own customs and manners.\n3. From here, consider the options individually. Option A \"don't eat on the streets\" would be an example of the visitor adopting the custom of the people to abide by the local laws, but not necessarily do as the Romans did.\n4. Option b \"wear shoes into the malls\" is not a custom that is specific to Rome, or to Romans, and is not really relevant to answering the question either.\n5. Option C \"wear shoes on the sidewalk\" would be a custom adopted by the visitor. Hence, it's a good example of doing as the Romans did, but it seems too much of a custom to justify calling it doing as the Romans do. Hence \"wear shoes\" is not a good example.\n6. Option D \"don't talk with your hands full\" actually seems more likely to be an instance of doing-as-the-romans-do (since it was a custom of ancient Rome), but it is not specific to Rome and not a good example. Hence, it is not a good example of doing-as-romans-do.\n7. Option E \"take your shoes off at a restaurant\" is specific to Rome, and it was a custom of the time, so it is probably an example", "answer": "A: contagious"}

Choices: 1) very sad 2) not very sad 3) very mad 4) not very mad 5) very pleased\nRationales: Start by looking at the questions statement. Lilly found her favorite jewelry and was very happy. \nStep 1: From here, identify any key details which provide more information about the situation. \nStep 4: In this case, the key detail is that Lilly's mother gave away her jewelry.\nStep 5. As such, the question revolves around how Lily feels about her Mom having given away her jewelery.\nOption 1: VERY SAD:  This describes an unreasonable level of sadness\nStep 6. Next, read each answer choice to see if any of them fit the situation. \nOption 2: Not very sad: This option would be reasonable if Lily was sad initially, but then began to recover.\nStep 7. However, the original claim and information provided (Lily is very happy), indicates Lily wasn't very sad (or she wouldn't be VERY HAPPY).\nOption 3: Very mad: This option makes no sense.  If Lily was mad with her Mom it would impact her initial happiness, meaning she isn't VERY HAPPY.\nOption 4: Not very mad: This option would be a reasonable response if Lily was mildly upset with her Mom, but not very mad.\nStep 8.

Choices:  a) a dog running in an open field b) walking into an urban area c) biking on a busy street d) a cow playing outside a petting zoo e) taking out your dog for a walk.\nRationales:\n1. Understanding the action of \"running on a forest\" and what it represents is crucial.\n2. The action itself is a metaphor and is meant to be compared to other actions.\n3. As stated, \"dog running... forrest\" is a metaphor, meaning its purpose is to be compared with other actions.\n4. Next, the best approach to answering the question is to use a process of elimination. The question provides five choices that must not belong to everyday life - only one of them is the truth.\n5. The first four choices describe something that belongs in everyday life, and the last is the only choice that doesn't. The choice that states \"A cow playing outside a peting zoo\" is the only choice that can be concluded as not belonging to everyday life.\nAnswer: E) Taking out your dog for a Walk\n\nInput: There are certain things you need to know and do to become a successful writer.

The prompt states that the story is about a teenage (singular of \"teenagers\") musician.\n1. Look at each choice's meaning and its relationship to the prompt.\n2. A: A teenage (singer). - The phrase \"teenage singer\" does not clearly relate to any specific topic or theme within the prompt. \n3. B: A teenager (life). - The phrase \"a teenager's (life)\" indicates that the choices refer to life events of a teenagers and not specifically a musician. \n4. C: A teenager - The phrase \"a musician\" refers to only one musician, not multiple musicians as indicated by \"teenagers\". Therefore, this choice does not explain the context fully. \n5.

Choice 0 refers to the possibility that no dog is barking. However, barking can occur in fields that are not empty. Therefore, this is not the correct response since the question asks for a correlation between field size and barking dogs.\n2. Choice 1 clearly indicates that no dogs bark in a very small field.

To figure out what she'd be happy to do herself, the next time, she needs to know what she's happy to work now.\n3. For that, we need to decipher the words \"it\" and \"job\".\n4. \"It\" means the job she's done and not a job she would have done.\n5. Thus, the job she \"will be happy to do in the next time\", is the job she \"will do by herself\".\n6.

{"text": "can be used to acquire food is 'hunt for food' because sleeping, humiliation, and going have nothing to do with food.\n5. The only option that is not only about eating food but also specifically implies getting it directly from the nature is 'hunt for it'.

Hence, the answer is A 'hunt for food'.\nAnswer: A: hunt for food\n\nInput: John is looking to get information that others won't. The information is sensitive,  Why is John going down a specific path? Choices:  The data is of public domain. The data has been stored by the government. The data is of no interest to him. He is a spy.\nRationales: The question asks why John is going down a specific path. To find the right path, we need to understand the context of the question. Here are a few things to keep in mind.\n1. John wants to gain information about something. Something can mean anything, including anything public, any data, information, records, anything kept by the government, anything that is of interest to him, and anything relevant or unrelevant to him.\n2. Since nothing here is stated as specific information or records, John is probably looking to find out something that others wouldn't know about.\n3. It means he is looking for sensitive information.\n4. In this scenario, information cannot be acquired if it has been stored by the govt. It would be the same with the data which is of no interest to John.\n5. Therefore the answer could be something like 'The information is of public domain' or 'John is a spy' because it would be impossible to get sensitive information if it is of public domain or if John is a spy. This would mean John is going down a path that involves a lot of risk and danger.\nAnswer: A) The information is of public domain.\n\nInput: An employee did something unforeseen that got in the way of the employee's goals.

Choices: 1: \"Have one on me!\" 2: \"I know how easy this will be.\" 3: \"I made a mistake.\" 4: \"If not, I'll refund your money.\" 5: \"Try it out for free.\"\nRationales: The question is looking for a sales pitch.\n\nStep: Let us first examine what a sales pitch is from the dictionary: It is a persuasive speaking or marketing to promote a business, product, or service.\n\nStep: Now examining each option: \n\nStep: 1. \"Have one on me\" is unlikely a sales pitch but more of a social greeting.\nStep: 2. \"I know how easy it will be\" does not seem to be a good sales pitch as such either.\nStep: 3. \"I made a mistake\" is not a sales pitch.\nStep: 4. \"If not, I will refund your money\" is not necessarily a sales pitch either. This may be considered as something the customer could use to negotiate if he doesn't find the thing satisfying.\nStep: 5. \"Try it out for you\" does not seem to fit the description of a sales pitch. It is more of a marketing technique rather than what is asked for.\n\nStep: The answer is 5. \"Try It out for free\". This example meets the criteria to be marked as an ideal sales pitch. Each of the above criteria is satisfied by the sentence and no other option does this.\n\nAnswer: 5. \" Try It out for free\"\n\nInput: Which is the lesser of the two of you?

The other answers suggest being too passive - thanking god or not doing anything about it at all or preparing to wait for it - and not directly providing food.\n6. Hence, the choice that best fits the situation is, among the choices given, C: hunt for food.

It's calm and patient in the toughest situations:  Choices:  A. waiting for dinner  B. a big screaming match  C. waiting for its owner D. a raging fire E. the owner having an argument with someone\nRationales: Start by looking at the qualities that the dog has in all the situations listed. There are certainly dogs who are patient in all of these situations. However, it's unlikely that dogs have such a variety of patience levels depending on the specific situation.\n1. Looking at the qualities that dogs typically have, waiting for dinner and a big screaming fight are both situations where dogs become anxious, while waiting for owners and the owner having an argument should invoke a loving, calm response.\n2. Thus, choice (A) is incorrect as dogs are likely impatient in waiting for their owner and also in a big screaming battle.\n3. Choice (B) is probably incorrect because dogs are unlikely to wait patiently during a big screaming argument between their owner and someone else.\n4. Choice (C) could be correct as waiting for dinner or an argument would not be a situation that would ordinarily invoke an anxious response in a dog.\n5. Choices D and E can both be correct since the dog's calmness could be invoked by the owner having an argument or even a raging fire.\n6. However, the dog's patience in the toughest situation is stated to be amazing. Therefore, the choices that would invoke the dog's calm patience would be (E) and to a lesser extent (D) since (D) indicates that the dog has to wait for its owner to return after the screaming fight with someone else, which", "answer": "E: hockey game"}

A. the screen gets brighter B. the light sensor is active. C. the device has motion sensors. D. battery percentage rises, E. battery level drops.\nRationales: The context of the question refers to a darken room.\nLet's list possible choices of what can happen when a tablet or e-book reader is used in a darken room. We know 'the screen gets brighter','motion sensors' and 'battery percentage rises'.\nBut'sensors' in this context refers to sensors that detect dark/light.\n\nHence we can eliminate 1. A.\n\nTo explain why this choice is incorrect, you must first understand the relationship between brightness and sensitivity in light sensors and dark sensors.\nIn other words, the question is about the relationship between the brightness of the screen and the sensitivity of the screen's dark sensor.\nSince the screen gets brighter, the dark sensor will be less sensitive to changes in light, so the battery percentage will rise.\n\nThis is opposite of the case since battery percentage will drop if the screen is getting brighter since the dark sensor will be more sensitive to changes in light.\nIn other words we can say brightness = less sensitive.\nIn the case with dark sensors, brightness = more sensitive.\n\nTo explain how dark sensors are more sensitive, imagine this:\n- Your dark sensors are already on low sensitivity to catch changes in light.\n- You turn up the brightness, so now you have a screen that is getting brighter.\nBecause you increased the brightness", "answer": "C: equal opportunity"}

For 'jerk' we need to have a person who is uncaring as well as having problems with their behavior.\nii) He himself might not be a jerk but his behavior can cause others to be a jerk. For jerk we need a person who behaves rudely and this can only work if he has problems but we need to exclude a person who behaves like this in general and does not feel the anger of others.\n\na) insecure - Insecure means to have low self-confidence and a fear of being criticized.\ni) Low self-confidence - does not necessarily lead to problems in behavior only in general personality.

It is asking for a place where eggs can be stored until they are used.\nNext, consider each option in detail. An important note to consider is how eggs can be used after being produced. \n\nOption A: 'in pantry'. This option can potentially be correct. But, the context of the question is 'pantry' refers to a place that keeps food (like ingredients or utensils). There isn't a clear reason why eggs would be stored in a pantry in this context. (There are places to store eggs and keep them cold.)\nOption B: 'fridge'. This option can technically work as another place, like a pantry, to store eggs for later use. So the answer can be B: fridge, but it doesn't match the exact context of this question\nOption C: 'inside chicken'. First, this is incorrect since chickens are animals used for raising eggs\nSecondly, it isn't clear how eggs, once they are produced, can be stored or preserved inside a chicken.\nOption D: 'under chicken'. The exact context of the question is storage until use, so that means keeping eggs in a place where they can be accessed when they are to be used, not in a place where eggs are produced or laid. \nOption E: 'in freezer'. While there is a valid use case for putting eggs in the freezer, they aren't necessarily'stored and kept' in that fashion since they are not kept there until they are needed to be used. And, furthermore, eggs that are cooked (e.g. scrambled eggs) are not the focus of the question. So, this option isn't an appropriate response to the question.\n\nThese options lead to answering the question of the answer being 'in fridge.'\nAnswer: B: fridge\n\nInput: A person of the 90s is walking around town", "answer": "C: corner"}

Feeling humiliated can be an emotion or a solution. This particular solution is not an actual course of action but a psychological state which doesn't immediately help with the problem of hunger.\n8.

He doesn't want to miss a chance to become an expert sports player. Jack tries very hard, not giving up.  What is Jack really saying? Choices:  I feel sorry for I am determined I am afraid I am scared\nRationales: To find the answer to the question, you first need to understand the personality of Jack. Jack wants to become an expert sports person. In order to do this, he needs to keep trying and not give up despite his potential failures. If he had failed once and decided to not try again, he would not reach his goal of becoming an expert sports person. Therefore, all of the answers except A & D are the wrong answer choice.\n1. In B, the word \"sorry\" means that Jack regrets something in the past and wants to keep trying for things to go well.\n2. Jack's goal is to become an expert sportsman.

Then I went to pick some up, but I couldn't find what I needed. I was annoyed because my list was so thorough. What's another way to say thorough? Choices: A: thorough B: full C: complete D: satisfactory E: specific\nRationales: This question is testing your understanding of the word \"thorough.\" It starts with the premise that you have made a list of everything you need from the supermarket, but when you went to pick what you had on your list, you couldn't find all of it.\n1. From this, the question is asking you which of the following adjectives is a synonym for \u201cthorough\u201d? To find an answer, first, identify the meaning of the word \u201cthorough.\u201d\n2. \u201cThorough\u201d can be defined as \u201cpaying complete attention to all the details.\u201d This word is an adjective. Adjectives modify nouns.\n3. The question gives you options A\u2013E below and, from information learned above, you are expected to say which one is a perfect synonym to \u201cthorough.\u201d The only synonym to \u201cthese\u201d is \u201cperfect synonym.\u201d\n4. From what we knew, A, C, and E are not perfect synonyms to \u201cthorough\u201d.\n5. Only B, D, and F remain. However, options B and D do not exactly mean \u201cpaying complete attention\u201d.\n6. Therefore the answer is F which is closest in meaning to \u201cpaying complete attention\u201d\nAnswer: F: complete\n\nInput: I have an idea!

The \"director\" is also not an actor in the film either.\nOption C: \"cinematographer\", option D: \"script\", and option E: \"set and crew\" are all still roles within the making of a movie, but they cannot be part of a performance.\nOnly option B: \"actors\" can act within a film, where they can play a specific part of a larger story.

{"text": "would be reasonably appropriate is to feel humiliated.\n5. There's no real reason for a neolithic hunter, for example, to thank god while trying to find food. They could more reasonably feel humiliated that they haven't been able to find food.\n6. Similarly, it would be unexpected for a neolithical person to wish to go to sleep. A hunter would typically feel a need to stay awake while trying to hunt for food.\n7. Finally 'preparing to go' doesn't make sense in this context. Neolithic person hunters didn't leave to go on trips. They stayed and hunted in their region. Thus a hungry neolithic person wouldn't prepare to go anywhere.\n8. Hence, the best answer is D: feel humiliated. The neolithic hunters felt humiliated when not able to obtain food due to lack of access.\nAnswer: DD: feel humiliated\n\nInput: My mom was a librarian.  She helped me to find a book i liked. What did she do? Choices: \nA: read the book B: check the books C: check the card D: put back the books E: make sure books are ordered\nRationales: The problem asked for any possible way of describing what my mother did.\n1. We are not looking at what the book was, just as the question is not asking if my mother read the book.\n2. We can safely eliminate the first option because she read the book as well.\n3. The second option is not possible because my mother was not responsible for books at the time, but for the cards of the books.\n4. The third option is not possible because that is exactly what my mother did, she put the books back in the right place so that others can check them.\n5. Only the last three options have the potential to correctly describe what my mother did. Those are possible because she made sure that books were back in the right order and in their own box, she helped me check the card to see which book was appropriate, and she helped me to check the books to see which one I liked.\n6. Hence, the answer is C. We must choose either of the three because it is certain that something happened because the sentence continues like, \"It was  a lovely book", "answer": "E: class room"}

How many concerts are going to be playing there each day? Choices:  E: 3 A: 120 B: 3 C: 12 D: 99\nRationales: A. To make the problem more specific, we first need to define how many people the \"concert hall\" can hold. If we consider that each row seats 100 people, each row has 4 empty seats, and there are 2 rows and 76 columns we can say there are at least 36,400 seats in the concert hall. \nNext, we need to take into account how many concerts can be going on at one. Given that a concert usually is one to two hours long and there are no other events happening during it, we can conclude that there are at least 240 concerts per day.\nNow we try to find out how many people are there at concert. We can observe that on average, each person attending a concert holds 1 to 2 people. Thus we can claim that a person attending a concert could potentially reach around 2 to 6 people.\nThere are at least 296 people at one concert. If there were at least 295 people at another concert during the same period and there were at least 581 people total at the concert hall that day, this would mean there at least 1386,310 people at a concert hall each day. \nB. According to the problem, some concerts will be playing at the same time. We can firstly observe that each concert only lasts 2 to 6 hours. We can further notice that there are 36,467 empty seats in the concert hall that are not being used. As such, for a concert to be playing in the concert hall there needs to be at least 36468 seats occupied and a minimum of 2 events playing simultaneously. \nThere would be at most 120 events per day, each event would at most last 2 to 3 hours, and there would be at least 75 empty seats. \nThere would thus be at least", "answer": "B: plane"}

A: volume - This answer choice can't be the chosen correct one as it isn't the channel we watch.\n\n2. B: up - This answer choice couldn't be the chosen one as 'up' refers to the direction to tune the up and down volume.\n\n3. D: channel - This can be considered as the correct answer because the channel number is the one we choose to tune the TV to the next show.\n\n4.

Fix holes in the roof to prevent water from leaking into the house.\nRationales: Start by understanding the central question in each sentence.\n\n1. The question asks \"the best way to fix a [water] damage leak is to find and plug the problem to...(stop leak). \n2. Hence we know we are looking for a choice which mentions the best procedure to stop the leak. \n3. As the choices given are of different nature, we should consider each in more detail.\n4. Choice A (roof). While this seems like it could be a potential leak source, it is actually the wrong problem, as it refers to the ceiling which can be damp. \n5. The next option B (sources). While this matches exactly what we are looking for, and this seems more a solution to the roof.\n6. Choices C (ceilings) & D (ceilings) talk about ceilings and ceiling damage and are not relevant to the question. \n7. Choice E (holes).

Which of the following is the most likely to change her behavior? Choices: \n A: Being in a big group B: Getting angry C: Being forced to speak D: Getting nervous E: Going on a date\nRationales: The following is the reasoning for choosing Option D: Getting nervous:\n1. According to the statement, Sara hates to interrupt others, and she is also described as being open and caring. These two characteristics seem to make her a sensitive person and, as a result, nervous in certain situations.\n2. Therefore, getting nervous is a likely way of changing Sara's behavior.\n3. Other options such as Being in a big group, Getting angry, or Going on a date are likely to have little effect on Sara's behavior, as they are not directly related to her openness, caring nature, or unwillingness to interrupt others.\n4. This leads us to consider Option D. Getting nervous.\n5. This is because she may act differently when she is nervous, for example, if she is on the phone and is unable to answer all the questions people may ask, she may get nervous and interrupt another person, or, for example, she may be in a situation she is unable to answer to any of the questions asked to her, then she may get nervous.\n6.

This one isn't so likely, or possible at all, but what if it was the case? The pet would be doing this: Rearrange the bubble bath: B. Next: C. Then, this: D. (If this had been the case the pet would probably have drowned in the bubble soap) Which option is best?\nRationales: Here are the reasons. 1. The options A, B, C, and D are correct but are wrongly placed. The pet is going to rearrange the bubble bath because it wants to make it bigger. So the right answer should be D: B. C. D. 2. So the order should be: D. B. C.; this is why answers B, C, and then D are correct but not in the correct order. 3. This means that your pet is going to do: Rearrange the soap  B. Then: C. Next: D. 4. All the options A, B, and D have been taken from the information in the question. A: This refers to the incorrect arrangement of the bubble bath, so it's out of the question. B: This refers to making the bubble bath bigger, so it's the only logical choice left. C: This simply refers to making the bubbles, so it's completely nonsensical. D: Is the only option that makes complete sense as your pet wants to make the soap bigger. 5. Therefore answer should be B. C. D: This order makes sense. Option C: This refers to the bubble soap which your pet has asked is larger when it will be rearranged by the bubbles. Option D: This refers to the only logical thing for the pet to do, which is to rearrange the", "answer": "C: party"}

What job could I give to what? Choices A: teacher B C: tutor D: friend E: student\nRationales: A school teacher could tutor a student in the subject in which he/she is teaching at that given school.\nA tutor is not a student.\nA teacher and student are not the same thing.\nA student could not help with a homework problem.\nA tutor has credentials and training to help with homework but is not a student.

B: to get rid of excess skin 3. C: to cool it off 4. D: to show people around 5. E: to cool it down before attacking\nRationales: Start by looking at the nature of this question. It describes how a tiger's tail behaves, with flicking being the primary action.\n1. Next, the statement \"To\" is present in almost each option.  But, the question only asks why the tail is flicking, which would indicate a single action. \n2. Option \"A: to make room on the tail\". Tail flicking seems to help move the tail, but is not the primary action, so this is incorrect. \n3. Option \"B: to get rid of the skin excess skin. Tail flicking might be related to helping cool the tail, but this answer does not directly address why the tail is flipping.\n4. Option \"c: to cool it off\". According to the choice, the \"it\" that is being cooled is the tail, but the question specifically asks why the tail is moving, so it is out of scope.\n5. Option \"D:to show people around\". Moving the tail around could be included in the reasoning for flicking, so it is not completely ruled out.\n6. Option \"E: to cool it down befor attacking. The flicking of a tail is not related to being prepared to attack, but rather can be a defensive or self-soothing move.\nTherefore, by process of elimination, the answer must be A: \"to make room on the tail.\"\nAnswer: A: to make room in the tail.", "answer": "E: save money"}

Their occupation is a common denominator among them.\nC. The two commonest occupations they share is that they are either all workers or they all work in a family business. \nTherefore, they are a: A. All of those, except the carpenter who is a worker and the candlesticks maker who is not.\nBut the baker could be either a worker or a member of a family business. Hence they are a: C.

Option A, exciting, is also used to describe exhilarating or even frightening events. However, it's too extreme for most academic essays.\n4. Option C interesting is too vague.

Choices;  A: beautiful waterfalls B: interesting animals C: delicious food D: amazing rocks E: colorful flowers\nRationales: The question asks for an appropriate word to describe a place. This place will be the \u2018most wonderful\u2019 one and thus must include all sorts of beautiful things that can be included but not mentioned specifically in the question.\n1. We know that this is an object question, asking for \u2018all sorts of\u2019 something. Thus, the answer cannot be something general like beauty, but should include specific elements that describe a wonderful place.\n2. Waterfalls refer to falling water. They are beautiful, and might be in a place, but they are not enough to answer this question.\n3. Animals can be found in many places.\n4. Food and drink are also not specific enough in that they are not a physical component of the place.\n5. Thus, the place should include things that can be seen, like colorful flowers, and things that can be experienced like delicious food if it were described as something you could include at the place.\n6. Furthermore, things that can be seen and experienced are both objects and thus the answer to the question. All sorts of things means all sorts of objects.\n7.

Choices:  a: A front door b: Some windows c: They are each more d: They both have a garage\nRationales: Option A: The front door is a common feature of both, so it indicates that they both share in the feature of having a front door. The front door is common between both houses. Hence, we can say they are both located in the neighborhood.\nOption B: The windows are a feature of the new house. An old house doesn't have a front door, but it does have a front door. They are new and old, but they don't share in a common feature of more doors. Only one door is there in every house. Therefore, the correct answer is A: a front door.\nOption C: Having a front door in a house is common. Not every house has a front door. The feature of a garage is common. The question specifically states that both houses do not have a garage. Therefore the correct answer is C: located in the neighborhood.

Choices:  a: go inside b: cover C: put a sweater on d: get under the covers e: get close to a fire\nRationales: The Question ask us to select an answer choice describing an action a child might do to save themselves from the Cold. To answer this question start by understanding what the Cold is and is not.\nThe Cold is a condition in which a child experiences a lower temperature inside of the body. Coldness in child can result from lack of a child's own body heat, insufficient clothing to retain body heat, and environmental conditions such as exposure to air or water at a low temperature.\nNow let us look at the choices provided to select one that best answers the question.\nThe choices provided are as following:\na: Go inside\nb: cover\nC: Put a Sweater on\nD: Get under the covers\ne: get close to a Fire\nBased on the information we gathered we will be able to conclude that the best answer would be c, or put a sweater on.  This is because put a sweater can serve as a method to protect kids from hypothermia because sweater can absorb heat.\nWhile the other choices can be considered a method as well, they would be less likely to be suggested by a child themselves as they don't have a large enough impact compared to covering oneself with a sweater.  Additionally, while you could get under warm blankets you are still dependent on the environment.\nAnswer: Option C: Put A sweater on\n\nInput: Jack's car broke down, he was lucky it was not when he was driving the kids.

Because the man is trying to focus on his work, the activity chosen should also be helpful in this regard.\nOption A: Taking a nap seems like it might be helpful, but research suggests that taking more than 30 minutes of nap can counteract the benefits of a sleep-promoting nap.

'Ambassador' implies a person who is sent by its leader (e.g. the president of USA may send ambassadors to other countries), not a person in honor.\n2. 'Diplomat' means someone who is good at managing complicated international relationships. \n3. 'Leader' means an authority who leads others.\n4. 'Politician' means a person who gets involved in politics.\n1. 'Prime minister','Servant' and 'F' are not the answer choice. \n2. 'Prime minister' is a title that may be given to a person such as 'prime minister of Japan'.\n3. 'Servant' means a person who is working in a house, not a person holding important positions.\n4. 'F' is not an appropriate answer choice since its meaning is not relevant to sentence.\n5. 'Servant' is the same as 'F'.  \n6. 'Servant' and 'Diplomat' refer to the same meaning of person such as a manager of complicated international relationship.\n7. In order to find 'a' that matches the sentence, you should choose the answer choice that is not related to any other answer choice. As a result, \nanswer choice B 'Diplomat' is incorrect choice because'servant' and 'prime minister' are related to 'diplomat'.\n8. Answer choice C 'leader' does not match the sentence.

Choices: A: dinosaur B: horse C: rhino D: woolly mammoth E: elephant\nRationales: After understanding the answer, the following justified reasons can be provided:\n1. Woolly mammoth,  horse, rhino, and elephant are not mammoths.  They are all types of mammals but not mammoths, although they are all related to mammoths.\n2. Dinosaurs are not mammoth nor any other types of mammal either.\n3. Elephants are not mammoth\n4. There are different species of mammoth, such as woolly mammonts and Jefferson's mammoths. However, none of these is a dinosaur.\n5. Similarly, mammoths are not rhinos.\n6. Finally it is correct that mammoths are mammals, and it can be inferred, based on mammals and mammoths' similar features, that mammoths have likely some kind of relation to horses, similar to that of modern horses to modern donkeys.\n7. These reasons lead to the conclusion that the answer is: woolly mam-moth\nAnswer: C: woolly mammah", "answer": "D: flea market"}

Choices: 1. A) cools B) kills C) moistens D) satiates E) strengthens\n2. A) cools\n3. B) kills\n4. C) moistens\n5. D) satiates\n6. E) strengthens\nRationales: We can see from the second sentence that \"the word dew can do many things: moisture, coolness, satiation, etc.\". So, we should make the correct choice to be among those \"many things\" that the word dew can do. Therefore, we should exclude choice D: strengthens. Note that choice D: the word \"dew\" can strengthen plants is not only an incorrect conclusion but it is also not among the things that the word dew does. Therefore, it should be excluded. Similarly, choice E: the word \"dews\" strengthens plant can also be excluded because it is an error that needs to be corrected. \n\n### Instuctions: Answer the following task by writing an essay (10 - 15 sentences)\n\n### Task:\nWrite an essay describing the characteristics of an exceptional student who learns Spanish.

How would you describe the situation in one word? Choices: 1. A: happy 2. B: social 3. C: boring 4. D: busy 5. E: fun\nRationales: First, we need to figure out what is going on in the question. Based on the context, we know that a large family spent all day at a reunion and the activities they participated in were focused around eating, drinking, and catching up. They do not appear to be engaging in activities that would be considered fun or entertaining. Instead, the events sound more like an essential requirement for family reunions: catching up and eating. They do not seem like the type of activities that one might do at a party or a time-consuming social event. \nSecond, we need to evaluate each choice and determine which one most accurately describes the reunion. We know that each option is supposed to be the one-word description of the situation, so while more than one choice might be accurate, each option is only supposed to have one word. \n\n\n1. The word \"happy\" implies that the activities of catching up and eaten were positive, enjoyable, and fulfilling. This choice clearly doesn't correspond with the details of the scenario. \n2. Similarly, the word \"social\" can refer to events which draw a large amount of people together or are meant to build relationships; however, here, the activities are limited to the catching up and eats that may be done within a smaller group. This word cannot be applied correctly to the situation either. The word \"boring\" would be an accurate description in that it indicates that activities which are not entertaining or exciting are what the family did. This word also isn't applicable in this context and therefore should be ruled out. The idea of catching", "answer": "A: selling out"}

Choice D: sleep is related to hunger, as the person may lie in bed in an effort to stave off hunger and wait on food.\n8.

Choices:  \"Than is\" A: superior B: similar C: inferior E: above \nRationales: The sentence contains a dangling modifier.\n1. The dangling modifier occurs because there is a word or phrase that is modifying a word while not directly linked to it. \n2. A phrase that starts with \"a dog\" is modifying a word, but the modified word isn't mentioned after the phrase.\n3. Therefore, you look at the phrases after \"a dog\" to see if they are relevant to any specific context, \n4. and if you find out that there is a \"word that can hunt better\" in that phrase.\n5. In the given phrase, only \"C: inferior\" expresses the idea of a dog \"hunting\". So the answer is E: above.\nAnswer: E : above \n\nInput: The last man was too weak.  If you are too weak,  what should you get?

The sentence means that if you are too weak, then you should get an electric chair.\n2. A phrase \"The last man\" is redundant in the given context.\n3. The meaning of \"too weak\" is clear because the sentence states that \"The last one was too weak\".\n4. The only relevant phrase used as a modifier in the sentence is \"the last electric chair\". \n5. Therefore the answer will be the phrase that can be used with the phrase with no additional context. In this case, it would be \"the last electric chair\", and the final sentence would be, \"If you are too weak, you should get The last electric", "answer": "C: curry"}

The question asks about the time after returning from traveling.\n2. Looking at the choices, the majority all end with 'AM' or 'PM'. The majority of the choices are also separated by 30 minutes intervals, except for 'night' and 'AM'.\n3. The answer is not specifically designated in the question, so we have to determine the likely accuracy of the answer choices.\n4. 'AM' is a time during the day, as indicated by the 'AM' suffix. As AM is not separated by any other interval besides 'PM', the answer must be a time in the day, between 9 and 10 PM.\n5. The choices in the evening are separated every 60 minutes in the end. Therefore, we can determine that every option except 'night' and 'nine PM' is wrong. The most likely option would be the choice between '7 PM,' '8 PM,' and '9 PM.'\n6. '8 PM' and '9 PM' are the other interval options and don't have time modifiers, so they are the two that have the highest probability of being correct. However, '8 PM' is immediately followed by '9 PM' in the same gap, so it likely indicates that some part of '8 PM' may be wrong.\n7. If, instead, we look at the gap and the second part of '8 PM', it becomes clear that '8 PM' is incorrect. '8 PM' is 6 and 60 minutes from the correct answer, not 4 and 60", "answer": "B: basement"}

Search the internet\nRationales: The question has been formatted in 'If...?' format, which usually signals the need of multiple options.\nThe first step in choosing is to understand the meaning of 'assign'. There are many definitions for the meaning of 'assign' in English. Among them, definition No. 2 is the simplest and clearest to understand, the act or process of giving a task or problem to be solved, typically to a specialist, or the task given.\nThere are two answers in the problem, so what you should do is find an option that is relevant to the specialist, to do the task of giving a task to another specialist, and that can be done as the assignment by the first specialist.\nAfter searching on the internet and comparing the different sources, the best answer is D. She must find a book of etiaries.\n\nInput: What's a common reason for a divorce that doesn't involve adultery? Choices: 1. A. Domestic violence 2. B. An incompatibility between husband and wife 3. C. Too much stress 4. D. Lack of intimacy 5. E. Addiction\nRationales: Start by identifying the most reasonable answer in the choices.\nThe divorce does not involve adultery, which is the only answer that is different from the others. Then the answer should match the following situation: One party has an issue with the other party's way or behavior.\nOption C is a close answer, but there is not much evidence that \"lots of stress\" will lead to divorce, because everyday stress normally cannot lead to unreasonable demands on a marriage.\nThere are no other divorce reasons, so the answer is A - 'Domestic violence'.\n\nInput: The president is a big believer in America's history.

Choices:  a: motivation b: dedication c: experience d: enthusiasm e: skills\nRationales: Steps:\nStep 1: We read the question and understand a little bit about the scenario it creates. It is based around someone looking for a new job and needs three things in order to find one quickly and effectively.\nStep 2: Looking at each choice individually and evaluating its usefulness for the person finding a job, we quickly determine that the most relevant and valuable criteria is:\na. Their motivation (the desire to find the right job for themselves)\nb. Their experience and abilities (the skills necessary to perform the job at hand for the right company, and thus the probability of being accepted if the job is advertised)\nStep 3: Looking at the other options, we realize that they can each be classified as non-essential, and hence are not as important as above.\nThese non-essential criteria, though, might still be worth considering before giving up on applying for a job, for example:\na. Some interview panels may want candidates to demonstrate they don\u2019t have much free time or are very passionate about that particular job (dedication)\nb. Their ability to learn (skills)\nd. Whether they are currently unemployed (enthusiasm)\nStep 4: Finally, looking at the choices again, we determine that in terms of relevance, experience is essential and in the least is the other three.\nTherefore the correct answer is:\nc Experience and Skills\nEvaluate Experience and Skills as one word. \nStep 5: Evaluate that the sentence is true to a certain extent, since experience can refer to either a past period of work or training, or to a specific set of abilities/characteristics a person may have, either in a job or outside a job.\nStep 6.

Choices A: use the internet B: watch French movies C: buy a book D: listen to French music E: talk to a native\nRationales: Here's a brief explanation of how to answer this particular question;\n1. Start by breaking apart the question and determining which section contains the relevant information. There are two: one about French and the other about learning.\n2. Focusing on the second half of a sentence, the question asks how to learn French.\n3. The first sentence of the question contains specific information, while the second and third sentences offer context.\n4. The first sentence of this context reads: \"a good way to learn xxx is to do xxx.\"\n5. In other words, we are told that there is a way to learn something. The way is referred to by a pronoun (\"it\") that indicates the same subject with the subject referenced by \"good\".\n6. This indicates that there is another part of the question that directly states what the correct option would be.\n7. Finally:\n8. Choice A: use the internet\n9. While this could be relevant, especially if the person who was learning French were online, it would be very hard to do all your French practice and study online.\n10.

The remaining three options, including 'thank god', do not mention going out to hunt for food or preparing food,  which is why it is the most likely outcome as the neolithic person looks to end their hunger.\n6.

It asks if you want to connect via the internet for power. \n4. It tells you that there's no power. \n5. Your iPhone is now powerless, \nRationales: First, we want to find the option that matches the sentence. In the middle of the night, if you want to avoid sleep-deprivation alarms, your last option would be to switch to a different application for sound.\nSecond, let's evaluate each of the options:\n  We are told that if the alarm for the next morning does not have enough power, the phone will go off and tell the user that there is no power.\n  As long as the alarm is not connected to the internet, it will not ask the user if they want to connect via the Internet for power.\n  Since the phone will be powerless if the alarm does not have enough power and we assume it only has power to connect to the internet if the alarm has enough power, we can assume that it will tell us that there's no more power.\nThird, let's find the best option:\n1. Airplane mode sounds plausible, but it should not affect the alarm's power since you are going to be using the phone.\n2. The alarm could still run with no Internet connection, which is why using another app will not affect the power.\n3. The alarm has no internet connection, but it has", "answer": "A: bathroom"}

A: stayed away B: kept quiet C: said sorry D: did nothing E: came back over\nRationales: In this question, we are asked to identify the response made by the given mother to the given son.\nThere are several points on which we can focus.  The mother sent the son away, but we can assume that she did so in the context of making a difficult decision.\nTherefore, in this sentence, we can identify and analyze various factors.\nThe factors are mother, son, go away, difficult decision, action, and come back over.\nOf these, we can make out the following actions: sent away (to do something, especially because it is difficult or involves risk) and staying, or come back over (the action of coming over to land).\nWe can consider the action of staying, coming back over, or coming back.\nIn the context of the question where we are provided that the mother sent the son away (so there is no element of risk present), we can conclude that the mother returned back.\nTherefore, according to the information provided, the right answer is E: came back over.\nAnswer:E: came bakc over\n\nInput: My mother tells good jokes.

Choices:  A. is too lazy to do anything else B. does not wish to understand me C. does not wish to engage in deep conversation with his/her friends D. is so busy that she cannot give me all of her attention\nRationale: 1. The text asks you to select an option that most accurately describes the type of personality that would enjoy full attention.\n2. Consider the text: \"I prefer someone who gives to me full attention\". The text does not refer to someone who gives \"the most\" attention but to someone who gives \"full\" attention. This rules out A. and B. (who wishes to give little/less/as much attention as possible); it also rules out C. (who does not wish to give full/any/deeper attention); and it rules out D. (who seems likely to give more/full/less/less than enough attention to the subject). \n3. Of the remaining choices, only E.

Choices: A: giving compliments B: managing expectations C: having friends D: talking E: taking care of themselves\nRationales: First, consider the issue of the question. The question posed here is about identifying which behavior a lot of people struggle with. \n1. Start by taking note of the words used, 'terrible at'. For someone to be terrible at something means they don't excel at the activity, so it is likely that a lot of people struggle in this domain.\n2. Based on the context, the issue would likely be related to managing expectations or having friends. \n3. The first of these options is'managing expectations', which could be defined as trying to get along with other people's expectations of us. \n4. The other options include 'having friends', 'talking', and 'taking care of themselves'.\n5. From these choices, 'having friends' seems to be the most feasible answer for this contextual issue. This domain can be understood as something that involves building or maintaining relationships.\n6. Other options like'managing expectations' or 'taking care of oneself' would indicate that the speaker has an individual behavior issue, while 'having friends' would signal an inter-personal issue, which aligns more closely with managing expectations in a relationship environment.\n7. Hence, the proper answer is A: 'having friends', which is defined by the question as something that a lot of people are often terrible at.\nAnswer: A -\n\nInput: I was able to meet my friend but how I had arranged it was what?

Choices: 1. A: 38cm 2. B: 5.5ft 3. C: 204cm 4. D: 208cm 5. E: 35cm\nRationales: To figure out what the question is asking, start at the basic. The question starts with phrasing that suggests measurement, leading us to conclude that John could be measured in terms of his height/length, which is the most likely to apply to someone named John.\nBased on the information given, the options are A: a 38cm pencil, B: 5.9ft, C: 203.9cm, D: 207.8cm, and E: 35 cm.\nLooking at the first few choices, it appears the question is asking \"How long is John\"? However, this is deceptive, and the question is in fact asking \"How much is John\"? So, the question is actually asking about pencil length, rather than John's height.\nWe also know that John cannot be more than 5.5 feet tall, or we would not be able to measure him in cm without it also being in ft, so we can remove option B, which would be incorrect.\nNext, look at the second set of choices, which are all measurements of the pencil, and choose the only one that would answer the question about John being measured in cms.

They used their advocacy as a form of what? Choices A: artistic expression B: scientific research  C: political activism D: creative writing E: moral philosophy\nRationales: We can make an inference about the author from the question itself and also from the context the options are provided in.\n1. The question asks about the author (plural) who was an advocate for a certain issue with their advocacy being a form of something.\n2. From the question, we can infer that the person is an author. The plural indicates that the person(s) is/are not the one who is arguing, but one who is making an argument and/or creating art. One who is speaking is also a speaker. One who is arguing about something is also an advocate. If there is just one author, there is no need for the plural.\n3. We can further support this with the context of the remaining options. When we look at them, we see that they can only be attributed to a particular person. For example, both scientific research and moral philosophy are not something a society as a whole cares about, though they may care about politics and creative writing.\n4. The only options which can be attributed to everyone who engages in a particular action is \"political activism\" and \"creative writing.\"\n5. Politcal activism requires action to advocate for something. Therefore, this option most directly matches the context of the question.\n6. However, it does not match what the word \"adocacy\" is used to refer to in the English language. The word \"adocacy,\" by itself, indicates that it is used to refer to someone or something that gives support to or urges action to be taken for a particular cause, and also that it is done in the public or official sense.\n7.

B: 1.3 children. C D: 1.22 children. E: 1.4\nRationales:\n1. Start by understanding that the question posits that John has two children, while Sam has something less than two (in other words, less than two children)\n2. Begin analysis of the various choices:\n- A: 1.1. Children is the inverse of the question. The question wants to know if Sam has fewer than one child and the answer is choosing the inverse would be 1.1 which means 2 fewer than 1 or 1.1 children, which does not make logical sense.\n- B: 1.2 is an integer which has no relation to the question as the author wants numbers in relation to 2, not a single integer.\n- C and D: 1.5 children, 1.6 children are not correct answers. Since the question is asking for choices which are less than 2, the answer to this choice is incorrect, and should be eliminated. \n- E: The statement that Sam has 1.4 children is a correct possible answer as that is less than two children.

What does \"dig himself out of\" mean? Choices: 1. A: buy a new car 2. B: improve himself and his life 3. C: solve an important issue 4.

The word 'to' suggests a relationship, so the sentence relates to someone working to dig him/herself out of something.\nWe can eliminate 1. and 3. as they do not have the desired format.\n\n4. D: pay a mortgage would suggest the person has the capability to pay the mortgage and therefore is not in 'dire straits'.\n\n5. The remaining two phrases (B) \"to improve himself and his life\" and (E) \"to start a new life\" do not contain the desired outcome nor the required format.\n\nHence, the phrase is (C) \"solve an important issue\", since \"digging himself \"out\" of an important issue indicates a change in circumstance or the attainment of a desired state.", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

Choices:  a: the governor b: a mayor c: a sheriff d: a farmer e: a criminal\nRationales: The question states that the lynch mob was very angry with someone, who can we assume they are angry with?  \nFirst, we can identify that the lynch was angry with someone because the lynch mob is a group of people that has come together and is taking action, which implies that they are unhappy and want something to change. \nSecondly, we can infer that the lynch-mob was angry with another person because they have gathered a substantial number of people based on option B: \"farmers.\" Farmers, in this case, are likely to be the most angry or upset because they are the ones who were affected by their actions.\nThird, we can assume that the sheriff is the person they were angry with based on option D: \"a sheriff,\" because they would likely target someone of authority because they want to put a stop to it. \nFourth, we can assume that \"the criminal\" is the person angry because option E \"crime\" can be related to the fact that \"sheriff\" is used, and \"crime\" is the cause of the lynch- mob.\n\nFinal Thoughts: After all these rationale, we can understand that this lynch-mobs were angry with \"a sheriff\" and a criminal.\nAnswer: A & C: The sheriff  and the", "answer": "E: urinate"}

Choices:  C: punctuation D: phrase E: clause F: clause phrase\nRationales: The sentence is a structure of words which can be further divided into either clause, clause-phrase, phrase, or word.\nSo, the part that contains words is either phrase or clause.\nThe part that contains phrases is either clause-phrase or phrase.\nThe part that can be identified either as clause phrase phrase if and only if it contains clause or phrase but not both.\nFor example, A clause phrase can be identified as \"Joe walked to the bank and his uncle saw him.\nHence, \"Joe walked to to the bank\" is a clause phrase but \"And his uncle saw him\" is a clause-phrase. \nThus, based on the context, clause-phrase is not a valid option for the question.\nIn terms of the phrases contained within a sentence, it can be identified as below:\n\nA clause\nB clause-phrase phrase\nC phrase phrase phrase\n\nBesides there are two types of phrase - dependent and independent - dependent phrase is subordinate to another clause.

Choices:  B: a sociopath C: a criminal D: an extrovert E: an introvert\nRationales: The question refers to a person with \"good qualities but is often crule\".\nTherefore, the answer to this question must match the description of the person. For example, \"cruel\" only indicates qualities such as lack of empathy. Therefore, it might not necessarily match the other options.\n\n### Explanation:\n**D: extrovert**\nExtroverts are individuals who tend to be very talkative and are often viewed as being full of energy.\nHowever, extroverts can do cruel things too. Therefore, **extroverts** can be both \"having good qualities _and_ being often cruel\" - \"having good qualites _and_ cruelness\".

Choices:  Tap water A: Disgusting B: Useless C: Good D: Ineffective E: Necessary\nRationales: First, start by defining what 'disgusting' and 'useful' might mean, since these are given in the answer choices.\n1. Disgusting suggests 'distasteful' and can refer to both food and activities.\n2. Useful can refer to 'important' or 'important to do'.\n3. The question asks about anything but'something necessary', which isn't used in this riddle.\n4. In order to understand 'what isn't it?', consider'something' as what's given in the prompt,  something useful, needed, or necessary can't be disgusting because it's necessary.\n5. In conclusion, the answer is A 'tap water' because 'it's not disgusting' when 'necessary'.\nAnswer: A tap water\n\nInput: A lump of coal becomes a gem, it's a what?

The word \"material\" suggests that the first state is a material, and the second state is of different material.\n1. In order to answer, it is necessary to identify the two given conditions so as to establish if one state is more \"material\" and hence would qualify as the \"material\" before and after transformation. \n2. However, among the six choices, \"miracle\", \"miracle material\", \"miracle transform\", \"miracle transformation material\" are synonymous in their meaning, and it is pointless to ask to choose between them and would render all choices irrelevant. \n3.

Choices: A: awkward enough B: big enough C: happy enough D: different enough E: not enough \nRationales: Look at what is asked in the question: 'We were in an awkward situation and I think the group of people we hung around with wasn\u2019t enough.'\n1. We can take out the 'we' from the question and just focus on the 'awkward situation.' Since we are trying to evaluate the situation in terms of the group we were with.\n2. Consider the choices we are provided: awkward enough, big enough, happy enough, different enough, not enough.\n3. If the group of people we were with was big, they might not be able to do anything about our awkwardness. So, the choices we are provided are either happy, different or not enough.\n4.

A: being born B: becoming successful C: making mistakes D: achieving a goal E: failing\nRationales: Understand each step of the answer choice:\n\n1. Questions and answers require you to do some reasoning to make the right choices.\n2. The first step is to understand the overall context of the answer choices and the overall subject.\n3. Look for clues in the situation.\n\nFor example, \"in their overall life experience\": This shows the overall goal of the situation. The person is looking for the event that helped them most.\n4. In this situation, the question mentions that the person is asking for something. The question could refer to a person looking for the best event, for a student who is in a situation where they need to rank their overall life, or some other context.\n5. We will work with all these possibilities by reading each answer.\n6. Read each choice to understand how it could be interpreted. For example, choose choice A: \"Being born.\" Being born is an important event that helps the newborn establish themselves and be able to move forward later on, but the event does not appear to apply to the question.\n7. For Choice B, \"Becoming successful,\" we find that the person might be trying to find the event that helped them become successful, so option B is not the right choice.\n8. Next, look for clues in each choice. Choice C: \"Making mistakes\" could be a good choice if we think the person is looking for the best event that helped them progress and develop. This choice indicates that the person has made mistakes and that being able to make mistakes is a good thing.\n9. With Choice D, \"Achieving a goal,\" the only clue that this choice applies is the fact that the person is interested in finding an event helpful for their overall life. However, this option refers to \"Achieving a specific goal,\" the event that will help the person achieve their specific goal. Still, it hints at success and achievement.

A patient who has high cholesterol is usually told they have high cholesterol, rather than being diagnosed with a high cholesterol problem.\n7. A patient will be diagnosed with a problem, rather than a disease.\n8. A stomach problem is what patients are most likely to be told that they are experiencing, rather than a kidney disease, a cancerous problem, or a blood clot disease.\n9. Therefore, the answer most relevant to the question is C: cancerous problem, as it describes the actual problem that a patient is most commonly diagnosed with.\nAnswer: C cancerous problem\n\nInput: I'm a big football fan, but after this many years, I no longer enjoy watching professional what?

To move leaves, what do they need? Choices:  C: wind  A: warmth  B: rain  D: water drenched leaves  E: water \nRationales: The question states that in order to turn a pile of leaves into one animal, it must first be moving.  A good answer can be deduced from this information as it gives the general sense to begin your research.\nThe choices must relate in some way to the information given. This means that the answer must be about how an animal is created because the pile of leaves must be moving and become an animal.\nThe word pile of leaves suggests that the choice must be made around a group of something, so C: wind and A: warmth have been eliminated. We are left with choices: B: rain, D: drenched leaves, and E: water.\nThe way these two letters are placed next to each other suggests that the letters must be referring to a similar subject, which in this case seems to be a rain system. \nTherefore B: rain, D; drenched leaves, E: water all look like they could be valid choice that can turn a pile of the leaf into an animal.\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is D: wet leaves.\nAnswer: D : wet leaves\n\n```\n\n### Instructions:Look at the following sentence written in old English.\n\n### Translation: The woman who dangled her bells around the horses' heads.\n\nInput: What sort of creature is \"she\" in this sentence?

Start by evaluating the first option, \"A. weigh of water\" The option states that \"weight of water in its hul,\"  which would cause loss of buoyancy. The options \"weight of water in the hold\" and \"weight of water in hull\" can be eliminated, because they do not contain the correct form of the phrase which states \"weight of water.\" \n2. The second option starts with \"water pressure\" which does not cause any loss in buoyancy.\n3.

Prepare to go or feeling humiliated does not directly solve the hunger issue, which leaves us with three choices between thank god, hunt, or prepare to go, which are essentially interchangeable options.\n6. So, choose the option which is more direct. The neolithic people were hungry, so they would need to have food or have a plan for where to get it.\n7. So, the hunger situation can be alleviated by either hunt for food or prepare to go, or a combination of those two.\n8. But considering the question itself, the neolithic people needed to have direct access to food, so the most direct option is to prepare to go, as they needed to get food.\n9.

What did they do? Choices: A: nothing B: cry C: pray D: complain E: ask\nRationales: The question states that the person thought they did not deserve what they got.\n2. The options to do nothing, cry, pray, complain or ask reveal that if we were given the option to do something other than stay quiet, we would have done that.\n3. From this scenario, the best thing to do while not having deserved what you got is to complain.\n4. Answer: E: ask.

My response would be what to you? Choices: 1. A: thank you 2. B: awesome 3. C: awesome 4. D: I'm happy for you 5. E: thank you\n6. Rationales: It would be best to put my response in words rather than using a phrase.\n7. In some scenarios using 'awesome' in the correct context can be correct. But it definitely is not appropriate to use it when addressing a teacher or a professor because the relationship between the teacher and student is not the same as friend and friend relation.\n8. So, we can exclude the above option from the list.\n9. Now we are down to four choices, 'awesome', 'I'm happy for you', 'Thank you', 'thank you'.\n10. So we have to see whether my teacher is happy for my success, or he is just happy for the success. We can see from the context that, 'I'm happy' indicates that my teacher is happy for another reason and not happy for my success. So, we can eliminate 'I'm happy'.\n11. So the choices left to pick are just two - 'awesome' and 'thank you'.  Now we have to see whether 'great teacher' describes my teacher. Of course, my teacher would be great.

She felt satisfied.\nSince the options were chosen in this order, it's safe to assume that Mary felt the opposite of all of the negative responses (sleepy, naughty, feeling full).\n\nTherefore, the choices were \"She felt well\" and \"She felt satisfied.\"\n\nAnswer: She felt well.\n\nInput: She felt naughty She felt satisfied She felt full She felt sleepy\nRationales: Since the only options we have left are satisfying, full, and sleeping, it becomes necessary to eliminate sleeping, satisfied and full and left with the option satisfying. She didn't feel satisfied because she ate an apple with the intent of satisfying her hunger. \n\nAnswer: She was satisfied.\n\nInput: Her mother gave her water. Her friend gave her an apple. And an apple tree gave her an apple. What did she feel? Choices:  a. well c. silly b. angry d. peaceful e. sleepy\nRationalese: 1.

That makes choice \"c\" seem like more of an option, as \"silly\" and \"angry\" both involve emotions rather than actions and \"peaceful\" is likely unrelated.\n3.

Here the meaning of a job and the meaning of a wife do not match each other. Job and car both show the person is trying to achieve something. But, wife does not. So, among these three choices, wife is the weakest and can be eliminated. Choice B: family. The same reasoning works of getting rid of family as it includes husband and does not match the meaning of wife. Choice C: house, child. The meaning of house matches the meaning of wife but with a husband. However, it matches the meaning of what we are looking for, so in this case, the answer is E. Health insurance, child.

Then, each option is listed with some information.\nStep 1: The question, \"Which of the following is a good way to save money while travelling?\", makes it clear that the answer should be one of the six choices listed. However, \"good way\" and \"save money\" are subjective terms, so the options don't have to be strictly the best ways to travel in a money-saver.

Choices:  - A: With fingers  B: They do not have fingers  C: With both  D: With their hands\nRationales: The following steps will assist you in answering the question.\n1. The question provides the option of fingers, both and hands. The wording of the question has a logical meaning which states a panda bear does not eat with fingers. Moreover, option A: \"With Fingers\" cannot be the correct choice because not all answers provided are incorrect choices.\n2. Next is the option of both and hands together. According to this answer, it is clearly stated that panda bears eat with their both hands which indirectly implies that a panda bear cannot eat with their fingers.\n3. Lastly, option \"they do not have fingers;\" can be a correct answer because panda bears do not actually have fingers, so you can't say that panda bears do eat with their fingers, but that they have fingers.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: \"With both.\"\nAnswer: C: With both\n\nInput: The reason for 99% of death is due to what? Choices A: old age B: illness C: suicide D: death from above E: natural causes\nRationales: Start by understanding that for humans today, the most common cause of death is old age rather than from above, suicides, illnesses, or because of natural causes.\n1. Based on the given answers: A) Old age, B) Illness, C) Suicide, D) Death from Above, and E) Natural Causes, the most common cause is old age.\n2. However, for humans generally, death from above would most commonly occur from war or battle circumstances, suicide would likely be an act of extreme mental instability, illness would more likely be a result that is due to a life of poor health and exposure to illness causing factors, and natural cause is usually considered to include all deaths that would not fall into the other four options provided.\n3.

C: threaten with punishment, 8. D: punish offences, 9. D: get tough, 10. D: ignore the bad, 11. E: have zero tolerance for bad behavior, 12. E: be strict\n\nRationales: As this involves the behavior of students, the choices are centered around making a new teacher's behavior influential or helpful.\n\n1. 'A: give them a cookie' would imply either that the students would behave better after getting a cookie (diametric to point), or that the teacher would reward the good behavior of some of the students. Neither is relevant.\n\n2. 'A: reward good behavior' seems to suggest a positive outcome if a new teacher rewards students for good behavior - however, this does NOT mean that the student is rewarded directly (eg. with a cookie).\n\n3. 'A: use rewards frequently' would be an action on behalf of the new teacher - giving rewards frequently would be good in cases if it is not related to good behavior, it would be bad for making a new teacher' task easier. However, this is not required for the action as the word 'help' appears in the context of a new student teacher.\n\n4. 'A: show that you care' suggests that a teacher should show some enthusiasm or care - even if the teacher is disliked, there is value in showing care for the student's sake, as it may increase their productiveness - but in this context, this would not help a teacher behave better.\n\n5.

The options given to us are \"the social\", \"network social\", \"social network\", and \"social service\".\n4. The question is about a new social networking feature on Twitter.\n5. Therefore the answer that is missing must be about a new \"social\" feature, because we aren't looking at the network being itself (the social networking feature on Twitter is a social network).\n6.

Given in the question statement, the boy took a certain amount of time to travel from his home to school, such that, due to this delay, he couldn't make it on time for the class.\n\n1. Next, let's look at the options offered. If 'Hours' was the answer, there would be no other options to choose from, but since hours is given as one of the choices, other options must be available.\n2. Similarly, if Minute was the right answer then all other options must be included, and 'Seconds' can't be the right answer as it is an alternative to minutes.\n3. 'Seconds' is a sub-part of the minute, and doesn't make sense as an alternative to the minute.\n4. 'Years' is also an inappropriate option as it must be given with other options, but because of the inclusion of 'years' as an option, it can't be the correct answer.\n5.

{"text": "involves securing food can be D: to hunt for food.\n5. This answer choice could involve hunting for food by running after animals, scavenging, or searching for wild fruit.\n6. Since running or wandering about in search of food can involve physical activity and stamina, the solution cannot be B: to thank god - god cannot be physically seen or found.\n7. Likewise, the solution cannot be A: to feel humiliated, which reflects on an emotional and mental state, so it doesn't include the physical activity undertaken.\n8. The solution could not be C: to feel humiliation, which indicates an emotional or mental response to being without food.\n9. Neolithic people, or those who live before the discovery of agriculture, don't have the ability to secure food through barter or buying, and are entirely dependent on the environment for their nourishment.\n10. Hence, the solution given is D: to hunt food, as this solution would have been the only possible solution to ending hunger for persons of this epoch.\n11. To clarify, even if a neolithic hunter came upon a flock of cattle or a store of cereals abandoned by their owners, they don't have the capacity to buy or barter such edible resources.\n12. They can only secure their food by hunting their prey, scavenging for edible fruit, striving to find edible seeds in bushes and plants, and even foraging for wild animals or livestock, and such processes entail physical activity, which is consistent with hunt for food.

This indicates that we can use the question to determine what signs can help us figure out it's leaking.\n4. The options are to look at the floor, the wall, or if the sink has poobled water.\n5. The choice to look at the floor is the only option that is directly related to a leaking dishwasher.\n6. All other options have no obvious connection to whether or not the dishwasher leaks. \n7.

Choices: A. hard work B. investing C. inheritance D. self-indulgent behavior E. talent and skill\nRationales: Firstly, when you read the whole question, you will see that there are two clauses. So you have to first find out what they both are talking about. \n1. The clauses say \"a person who is extremely rich\" and \"probably earned it through....\"\n2. So we can see that the first clause is talking about a person who is rich and the second clause says what had they done or earned to be called extremely rich.\n3. So the second clause talks about that person's possible actions or traits.\n4. The given options are hard work, investing, inheritance, self-indulgent behaviour and talent and skill. \n5. Investing may be done by self-indulgent people, inheritance maybe given to self-indulgent, hard work can lead to gaining talent and skill but that doesn't mean you will be rich and people who are inherently talented or skilled can also work hard and invest and still remain rich but that doesn't take away their talent and skill.\n6. So self-indulgent person may have many other possible actions too. The same is the case with the second clause also, where talent and skill is listed twice without mentioning hard work and inheritance.\n7. So, considering all this, the most possible answer is self-indulgent. The person is self-indulged and has earned through their talents and skills.\n8. Hard work, investing and inheritance are all possible methods through which people earn their wealth but they may not be self-indulgent in nature.\n9. Also, self-indulgence is an action and not a trait or characteristic so self-indulgent is not mentioned in the first sentence.\n10.

The option that the speaker says he started to find meaningful is option D: meaninf. 2. There is no option for simple. So, the remaining choices are monotonous, dull and boring. 3. Option A: monotonous. It suggests the previous task was boring, dull and monotonous. It also does not suggest that it was anything other than work. \n4. Thus, the only option is monotonous A.\n\nRationales: The question asks us to choose what a speaker finds more meaningful. 1. The speaker finds work meaningful. 2. We know this because that is the only option that is marked as more meaningful, \"I started finding my work meaningful\". 3. The speaker is satisfied with the work, and is not trying to find anything more meaningful. 4. So the only option is B: \"interresting\".\n\nRationales; We are looking for what the speaker does not find monotonous. 1.

First, \"say that...\" should be considered to determine what the question is asking us to do.\n2. There are two parts to this question, \"good communicator\" and the list of adjectives following it.\n3. The first section is a verb \"say that\" followed by a noun \"a person...\", which indicates that the question wants the player to explain the idea of a good communicator by defining it.\n4. Moving on, to the second part which includes a list of adjectives.\n5. These adjectives come after defining a communicator, but before actually stating that a given communicator is good.\n6. Therefore, you can assume they are describing what makes a good communicator, and each one is an important quality.\n7. Looking at the provided choices in light of this information, an \"articulate\" communicator is one who is clear in what they say.\n8. Similarly, the second quality is \"understandable\" which indicates that a good communicator can be understood by others.\n9. \"Confident\" conveys the message that a good communicator has the courage to express an idea and stand by their beliefs.\n10. \"Intelligent\" reflects that a good communicator is also intellectually sharp.\n11. \"Convincing\" means that the person can persuade others through their speech. \nFinally, \"engaging\" means that a good communicator captivates their audience by their words.\n12.

In the given choices, analyze is related to understanding as it involves studying the steps that made up the equation.\n3. Memorize is also related to understanding the equation because it requires studying the steps and memorizing them to later be interpreted.\n4.

They would not feel humiliated, go to sleep, or thank god.\nAnswer: D : hunt for food\n\nInput: In case of a rainstorm, I recommend that you wear clothes that are what? Choices: wet-dry absorbent A: cotton B: rubber C: warm D: thick E: waterproof\nRationales: This question asks for clothing choices to take during a rainstorm, so you would have to consider wetness protection and weight. There are two options that are meant to be true: \"absorbing\" and \"waterproof.\" A wet-dry fabric can absorb moisture until it completely loses its strength or becomes a part of the liquid. This limits its waterproof value over time. It doesn't immediately absorb water like cotton or rubber fabrics. Instead, it can be damp and wet for a long time. A cotton fabric is not made to absorb moisture and does not offer any significant level of protection. Cotton is a warm material that dries quickly but is heavy for a fabric. The fabric of choice should be warm, dry, and light. Cotton is neither of these things because of its tendency to absorb moist at all times, making it wet and heavy, neither of which is a benefit. In addition, cotton does not last long under wet conditions, as wet fabrics tend to have a shorter lifespan. This means that they'll need to be replaced and can damage things. Cotton is also not waterproof because it absorbs water and turns into a part of the liquid in question. Because of this, it cannot be a \"water-proof\" option on the examination. A rubber material on the other hand, takes longer to absorb water, and it might not absorb as much water as you would", "answer": "A: nailed"}

She never causes trouble, but I'm worried she's hiding what? Choices: A : depression B: an eating disorder C: ADHD D: anxiety E: dyslexia\nRationales: The question first explains that Samantha is well-behaved, never causing trouble.\nThis suggests that she either doesn\u2019t cause problems because she is able-bodied, or she doesn\u2019t cause problems due to mental illness or emotional issues.\nWe then are given four choices for what Samantha is hiding. For each choice, analyze the context to try to narrow down the answer, and then analyze each answer choice individually.\nThe clue is that she is well-behaveds despite her issues, so she is not hiding any of the issues mentioned.\nWhile all the issues listed affect behavior to some extent, none of them can be ascribed entirely to one\u2019s behavior, so none of them can be hidden.\nA depression is something that a person may be well-behaved and even happy through a lot of the time, but still depressed most of the time.  An eating disorder is characterized by a person\u2019s behavior towards eating.  An ADHD is a neurological condition that does not affect a person\u2019s behavior, but does cause mental, emotional, and/or social issues. An anxiety can also be a form of mental illness, but it can also be a response to a situation that may make a person well-behaved.

The question mentions that there is something that happened to this man; thus, there must be an answer that is about the event, as opposed to the man's character. \n2. Based on the description, the likely outcomes will be: receiving bad news, injuring himself, being drunk, having a fall, waking up from a deep sleep, being robbed, or being attacked. \n3. Of the provided options, receiving bad news would not explain the staggering home; injuring himself would result in immediate medical attention; being drunk would not result in immediate medical attention (the symptoms of drunkenness can last longer than a short walk); having a fall would not result in immediate after-effects (he would not stagger in the middle of the fall); he would not wake up from a deep sleep immediately, but go about his day; he would not have been robbed if it had just happened, and therefore, this could only be one if he was robbed earlier. (The man staggering home must have happened immediately after, though). \n4.

Choices: A: make a decision B: create anything C: have fun D: understand a joke E: be spontaneous\nRationales: The word \"overexacting\" refers to a person who is excessively concerned with accuracy, attention to detail, or precision. A person like this could be a perfectionist who wants everything done exactly as they envision it.\n1. The question asks what difficulties an over-exact person may face when trying to do something.\n2. We assume that an over-exact individual wants to succeed, so we can rule out any negative outcome as a feasible choice.\n3. We can eliminate choices and eliminate A: make a decision because this phrase makes the most sense when referring to decisions that are not made with complete perfection, such as hasty decisions.\n4. We can eliminate choice and eliminate B: create anything because they are not referring to things that require perfection.\n5. We can eliminate D: understand a jokey because the question asks what difficulty they may face when trying to complete a task, which doesn't make any sense in the context of jokes.\n6. Similarly, we can eliminate E: be spontaneity because this choice requires a different set of skills than perfectionism.\n7. Finally we can eliminate choice C: have fun because this choice directly contradicts the phrase \"over-exact\" which would not apply to someone who is trying to do something perfectly. \n8.

Choose a logical relationship between the words. Choices:  A. on: in B. sit C. pigeon: pigeon house D. pigeon house: pigeon E. roof: pigeon house\nRationales: There are a few steps to answer this question: \nStep 1: Start by considering the pigeons. Pigeons are related to both the pigeon houses they live in and the pigeon houses' roofs.\nStep 2: Next, consider the choice of options. Each option has a different relationship between the words. The difference has to do with the use of prepositions and articles.\nStep 3: Article A: \"'On' is used with indefinite pronouns e.g. someone, anything, everybody, nobody and with adjectives e.g. young, strong, poor, beautiful, etc.\" So we know that option A: pigeon, in, pigeon house is wrong because the sentence does not contain an indefinite pronoun.\nStep 4 The sentence needs an article, and articles precede the words that follow them. Hence, it should be pigeon house, the, on as there is an article, but the word before the comma.\nStep 5 The 'with' used in the options before article E should refer to the words before it, but articles come before the word they modify. So, articles should not be used with the preposition 'with' in these two options.\nStep 6 'Pigeon house' is an object in the question, but objects do not precede an article. Choice C is wrong because it has an article before pigeon house.\nStep 7 Option A is the logical choice because it has no articles at all after the preposition 'on'.

Choices: \nA: cut them off the vine as they do so.\nB: wait until they're ready, and harvest them.\nC: put off watering their plants to save water.\nD: give them more water.\nE: spray them with chemicals to delay ripeness. \nRationales:\n1. The question refers to a farmer, which is a person who is employed to work on farming.\n2. This means they planted their seed and took care of the plant as it grew.\n3. In farming, drying means the sun or the weather getting too hot for the tomato plant.\n4. Now the farmer wants to know what to do to make the tomato plant not dry out as soon, and they will also want to preserve the taste of the tomato.\n5. The four choices given refer to things that could happen.\n6.

Choices: 1:  A: cancel itself. 2: B: Have everyone come. 3: C: Do not have a party. 4: D: invite a friend. 5: E: Let it rain.\nRationales: Based on the options provided and the information given, cancel is incompatible with 'party' as an answer choice as it means, 'to call off a plan or event'. In opposition, the party is intended as a celebration. On the other hand, have everyone come can be explained as an option for the party being successful, thus being unsuitable as an option. Do not have a party is a suitable option for not having the party, but it is not suitable for the purpose of ensuring that the party does not get canceled, which is the purpose of the question. Invite a friend as an option may work for ensuring the continuation of the party, but not for the purpose of making sure it does not get cancelead. Let it rain as an option makes no sense at all.

The questions asks us to identify an activity that could cause an issue for someone who has a fear of hight. So, we are looking for a specific activity that a person could engage in given their fear of hight.\n2. After reviewing the given choices, the one that comes closest to the type of issue this question is looking for is the first one, bungee jumping. It is clearly one of the most dangerous extreme sports, and also one that involves a height.\n3.

Choices:  B: proper hygiene C: balance D: foods E: good health\nRationales: The question asserts a person must have health in order to feel health. There are two ways to solve this question:\n1. Start by understanding what balance means in this context. Balance means that a person's health is the perfect state in which someone is not only physically well but also emotionally healthy.\n2. In this case, it is clear that not having good health means not feeling health.\n3. Hence, it is clear that good health is required to feel health.\n4. Next, consider both options. Proper hygiene refers to staying clean and taking care of your body. It does not refer to feeling health.\n5. Same can be said about option C: Balance. Balance refers to a mental and physical balance that ensures physical health. It does not mean a person who is in a healthy state of mind.\n6. Similarly, same can be said about option E: Good health. It refers to a condition of being physically fit and free from disease. It doesn't mean that a person is in a healthy emotional state.\n7. Therefore the answer would be option D: foods.

The two terms have no overlap in meaning or relation. Therefore, it is unlikely that there is any way that these two terms could be related.\nStep 2: So, the options have to relate to each other.

If the pot is upside down, the bowl will be upside, so a bowl upside-down has a similar upside-down situation to a pot.\nAs the choices are on the bowl and outside the bowl, it would be impossible for the pot to stick to the outside (since the top and bottom must be different, if you have an upside down bowl, the bottom can't stick when the outside is empty). \nInside the bowl would definitely cause the bowl to turn over, and not the pot.\nTherefore, IV.

We can quickly eliminate B: toilet  paper since Dana is not buying toilet paper.\n3.

Choices:  All of A: stars B: constellations C: planets D: satellites E: rainbows\nRationales:\n1. When looking at the clouds through a lens, one is likely to see stars. This is because it can be difficult to make out constellations, planets, rainbows, and satellites through a telescope due to their relative smallness in comparison to the sky.\n2. Stars are visible through telescopes, so the best answer would be A.\n3. A can also represent All because all stars aren\u2019t seen through a telescope, however, because it is possible to see some stars, this would be the best answer.\n4. B, C, and E are not all correct answers because the question asks what you would likely see through a telescope, not what you would see through a cloud, without a telescope.\n5.

Choices: A: cooking B: eating C: preparing to go D: gardening E: teaching a new skill\nRationales: Start by breaking the question down into two key aspects: 'busy' and 'play'. What would make a person too busy to play?\nStep 2: Understand that the person was too busy doing something, but what was that something?\nStep 3: The possible answers are cooking, eating, preparing to go, and gardening.\n\nStep 4: Eating takes too long at the table; therefore, it is an incorrect choice as an action.\n\nStep 5: Likewise, preparing to go likely took too long as a distraction from playing. Therefore, this is also an incorrect choice.\nStep 6. Gardening takes a short time, yet involves preparation. So, gardening is not likely the action that resulted in the individual being too busy to play\nStep 7. Cooking also involves an intermediate time that is likely too long to be a viable candidate for being the reason for the busyness.\n\nStep 8: Teaching requires a lot of planning and preparation time, but may also end quickly, depending on the time taken. In order to determine which, further consideration is required.\n\nStep 9: In this case, it is clear that the person was busy, but it is not clear how long, and it may end quickly. In contrast, the person is certainly too busy to play and they may take a meal between this time. So, the answer must be a time that the person may or may not take, but if they do, it will be over quickly.\n\nStep 10: This means the correct answer is D -- garden", "answer": "A: infect"}

D: It has a red frequency which helps boost mood. 5. E: It reduces light pollution and blue light.\nRationales: There is a range here, so we should be looking at the words given and seeing which make the most sense.\n1. A: The question makes a connection between how hard it is to sleep and the lamp, but if we don't know anything about this lamp the description doesn't go anywhere.\n2. B: While the lamp may be without toxins, if the reason this woman has a \"very hard time sleeping at\" is due to stress, the color it produces will not be the most important factor.\n3. C: The question does not ask about the lamp's color, but about its effectiveness in dealing with a woman's poor sleep quality. The question says \"why it might be beneficial\". It's clear the benefits are to reduce her stress, which is a very likely outcome of sleep.\n4. D: Similar to C, this answer is related to the issue of the woman who cannot sleep, but it is more focused on how this light will boost mood, not on how it will increase her relaxation.\n5. E: This option is more related to the question's focus on the environment, rather than the question's primary concern, stress.

Choices:  C: fence the area and not let rats enter  A: get a rat trap  D: change crops and have less food  E: poison to kill them\nRationales:1. This question is about the relationship between the farmer's problem with rats and his solution, which was a cat. The question is asking why cat did not work.\n2. The farmer chose cat as his solution to his problem with rats, but the question states that cat solution didn\u2019t work. There are 5 options and you must choose the best one to answer the question.\n3. First you must identify those options that are not related to this problem. This would be poison to kill them, change crops and have, less food. The question is not about the solution not killing rats, but rather why cat was not a solution to the problem. As another example, the question is asking, If cat did not work, would changing the crop help with the problem?\n4. The answer should be why the cat did not solve the problem. If the answer selected is in fact the best option but it is not related to the question then your answer is false and you did not complete the question correctly.\n\nRationales: A: To exterminate rats is a synonym for the main phrase of the problem that the farmer is experiencing which is to get rid of the problem of rats or not have any rats left. So your answer can be true or false and your response should state that cat is not working to get rid of the rats.\n\nRationals: B: A rat trap would not solve the issue of the problem of rations, but rather would only help with the problem of the farmer killing a rat or rats in", "answer": "D: cruel"}

Choices: Cities, Mines, Gas Stations, Subway Stations, Coal Power Stations\nRationales: Start by understanding the context and structure of the question. The question is asking about how climate change is preventing humans from adapting.\nIn order to answer, we need to find an example of an unadapted circumstance.\nConsider the list of answer choices: Cities, Minds, Gas Stations, Station Subways and Coal Power Stations.\nWhile it is true that these things are still used or present, they do not exemplify how people have not yet adapted to climate change.\nCities have been adapted to deal with climate change, they are generally densely populated and can be found in temperate climates. For example, temperate climates experience four distinct seasons, whereas most cities are not too warm or too cold.\nMines have experienced adaptations as well and no longer use traditional means of extraction, instead transitioning to solar, wind or other sustainable energy sources.\nGas stations are still used but not exclusively, especially in cities.\nStations have adapted by increasing energy efficiency or using new sources of energy such as windmills.\nCoal power stations remain, but are being gradually phased out in favor of safer forms of energy such as natural gas or renewables like windmills.\n\nBased on these reasons, the best answer is Station Subways as they were originally designed based on coal power but have since been adapted to solar power.\n\nAfter analyzing the given choices, the best answer would likely be Station Subways. \n\nAnswer: E: Station Subways\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Instructions:  Answer the following multiple-choice Question.\n\n## Instruction:  Answer the following Multiple-Choice Question.\n\n### Rationale\nStep 1: Read a question carefully when answering", "answer": "A: sun himself"}

Choices A: precise B: direct C: aggressive D: decisive E: demanding\nRationales: Look at the question. The new boss is more [adjective]. \n\n* If the adjective were 'precise,' then the correct answer choices would be Precise or Aggressive or Direct or Demanding. \n* If the adverb were 'aggressive,' then the correct answers would be Precise, Aggressive, Direct, or Decisive.\n** If the adverb were, 'direct,' then the correct answers are Precise, Direct, or Decreasing.\n** If the verb were, 'precise,' then correct answers would be Pecise or Aggressive, or precise.\n\nFinally, check for word boundaries, capital letters, sentence fragments, and punctuation.\n\n1. Aggressive can be used as both an adjective or an adverb. In our case, it is being used as an adverb to modify the phrase 'was more'. So it cannot be 'aggressive' as one of the possibilities, but instead it would only be'more aggressive'.\n2. Decisive can be used as an adjective or an attributive adjective. In our case, the word 'decisive' has the meaning of 'being a good decision'.  So, the answer choices cannot be direct or decreasing, as they are not related to being good decisions.\n\nHence, the correct answer is: 'decisive', 'decisive', and 'decisive'. \n\nTherefore, the new boss was [more decisive](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/example/more-decisive) and [more decisive] than [the previous boss].\n\nAnother approach\n```python\ndef solve(s, t)\n    choices = []\n    ans = ''\n\n    def is_valid(c):", "answer": "B: unbreakable"}

Prepare to go refers to the person being prepared to find or hunt for food by doing something like gathering food or food-related supplies and resources.\n7. As an option, the use of humiliation indicates that the neolithic person had a sense of humility, which may be true, but can be interpreted to mean that they had a low self-esteem. This interpretation of humiliation as humility is not aligned with the question as given.\n8. Similarly, feeling humiliated could mean that the person was overly modest and this would not serve as a suitable solution either. \n9. The choices, then, are A: thank god, B: hunt for, C: feel humiliation, D: prepare to go, E: sleep. D-Prepare to Go can be eliminated based on the answer process of elimination.

Choices:  a: death b: rejection of the original bacteria c: rejection of the new bacteria d: overgrowth e: stomach flu\nRationales:  1. Start by understanding that the question asks about the likely outcome of a patient who had bacteria enter their body and replicate.\n2. Next look at the choices.\n3. Option A: death is unlikely as bacteria replication in a healthy host does not always lead to fatal complications.\n4. Option C: rejection of the bacteria is also unlikely as these choices refer to a reaction that is a natural immune response to the arrival of an unknown pathogen.\n5. Option E: stomach flu is not likely either since stomach flu would require the bacteria to cause direct damage to the host. Stomach flu occurs only if bacteria were already present in the body.\n6.

Then consider the choices that are given: paper, words, other, support, sentences.  None of these are good choices because each object and each action are represented by a verb, so they are not the actual objects of the sentence.\n3.

There are 6 choices given, each of which is either an action word or a noun.\n1. From the process of elimination, the adjective \"sturdy\", \"fighting\", and \"loser\" are out, because they do not directly describe a person who always win, and the question has already established that this is the person this noun modifies\n2. Between options \"talented\" and \"winner\", \"talented\" should be eliminated because it does not mean \"always wins\".\n3. The answer is D: Sturdy. The word \"Sturdy\" means stiffness, especially strength and vigor.

But sometimes they may fail to find the food. Then they should spend the night to sleep for the food in the next day.\n\n#### In short, the people in Stone Age should hunt for food if hungry.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. A person is a plural noun, not singular, because it refers to several people.\n2. The plural form in this sentence is \"the people.\" So the person is the plural form.\n3. The question asks us to \"identify the words\" or to identify the parts of the sentence. This means we should look at what words make up the sentence.\n4.

Choices:  Hailstones, A: Birds B: Wind C: Tree limbs D: Stones E: Flapping\nRationales: Start by understanding the context of the situation. The car is destroyed and we are given the choice to determine the cause.\nLooking at the given choices, if it is birds, we need to find something which hits the car with enough force to destroy it. We don't have any indication that the birds caused the damage, but if they did cause the problem, it might be hailstones.\nThe other choices are also possible causes, but we need to find something that falls with a force sufficient to damage a car. \nNext, looking at the meaning of the words, hailstone is a type of precipitation (a form of precipitation that comes from the atmosphere in the form of ice crystallizing from water). \nAll the other choices are things (birds, wind, tree limbs) which move with some amount of force.\nGiven this information, we can determine that the car was destroyed by a hailstorm.\n\n1. \"Hailstorm\" is the only option which is a natural phenomenon and which can have the appropriate level of destructive force\n\n2. Even if the other phenomenon is hailing (the answer), we can still say that hailing can happen alongside a hailstorm. The only way for the car to have been harmed by rain is hailing (it has a chance of causing hailing)\n\n3. We can also exclude all choices which have a lower chance to happen to the car (birds, wind)\n\nSince hailstones are more likely to cause damage than the other choices, the correct answer is A: \"Hailstones\".\nAnswer: A: Hailstones\n\nInput: A new", "answer": "B: big house"}

Although the person could simply have an enjoyable, pleasant day that does not feature their strongest characteristics, it is clear from this statement that they have also faced challenging circumstances in their life.\nFor example, \"his house is on fire\", which clearly shows some perseverance or strength of character in trying to deal with difficult circumstances.\nThere has also been pain or trauma (\"They lives\").\n\nOf the given choices, Joy and Kindness are both \"happiness\", compassion and kindness can be considered similar and all of these seem closely tied to happiness and perseverance. \n\nThe main difference would be that kindness is less concerned with other people and more concerned with how the person feels which means that we are more likely to have compassion than kindness.\n\nBased on these attributes, we can state that their strongest quality is compassion because it shows a concern for others, as well as an ability to overcome pain. \n\nAnswer: B: compassion is their strongst quality.\n\n### Output:\n\nAnswer A: This is the final sentence before the question. \n\nAnswer B: This is the main body section following directly after the question. \n> Answer:\n```\nExercises 13-14\n\nInput: His only answer at school was to look at his shoes and say nothing.

Entrepreneurs often have to turn to funding from a variety of sources. \nLook at the choices provided. All of them appear to be possible sources of funding for entrepreneurs.\nFunding options can vary between countries, communities, and businesses. For entrepreneurs, a key concern is being able to secure funds for their business.\nFinancial institutions are not necessarily the only way for entrepreneurs to obtain money on loan. They can get funding from personal investments, venture capital, and state loans.\nMany entrepreneurs rely on funding provided by their families or through venture capital firms.\n\nPrivate and public venture capital provides a source of money for new businesses to gain a foothold in the marketplace.\n\nWhile financial institutions can be a source for loans and state loans, venture capital may include some of the same sources as private.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is 2.

The question doesn't explicitly state that the food will be \"soon deserted\", so this choice could be correct but we cannot be sure given the vagueness.\nContinuing from 2., Choice 3. does not suggest people are going to use each other as resources if they're hungry, they would probably do that just", "answer": "A: briefcase"}

Another point to note is that no other choice fits the context provided in the question or describes the situation in which a neolithic would find himself. \n6. Finally, one might consider hunter-gatherer societies, whereby the bulk of subsistence comes from hunting. However, the neolithic period involved the advent of farming, whereby the bulk subsistence came from domesticating farm animals, or growing crops.\n7. Therefore the answer is D: hunt for food.

A: it looks like a rock B: it is not visible 2. C: it is not real D: it is always in the shape of a smiling face E: it's always up and down\nRationales: The choice to answer \u201cE\u201d is not the correct answer because we are given an option to state that the moon is always up and down. It is a fact that the moon moves from up until it moves down. The moon does go through a cycle, showing different phases. Hence, not always up.\nThe answer to the question is \u201cD\u201d as the choice to answer the question as \u201cit is always in the shape or a smiling face\u201d is not an appropriate response to the question. Although the moon may be always in the shape of smiling face, this choice can be an opinion rather than a fact.\nThe choice \u201cB\u201d is not the correct one as the option \u201cit is not visible\u201d is an opinion. This implies that the moon is not visible and this is not a fact.\nThe statement in the question suggests that the answer is from the perspective of a person from earth. Hence, if a person is on the surface of the earth or from space, the question requires the answer.\nThe choice to state \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, and \u201cD\u201d is wrong because it does not meet the expectations from the question. The correct answer is \u201cD\u201d because it provides the information mentioned above, and in the same way does not provide the opinion.\nAnswer: D \"It is always in the shape\"\n\nInput: Who is a better swimmer: Mark or Mary", "answer": "B: map"}

Choices:  a) west b) south c) north d) east e) centre\nRationales: a) west: In summer, the west wind brings hot air from the deserts towards the coast.\nb) south: The land heats in the summer sun, this traps air below it. Air from surrounding areas will try to escape upward as it warms. This will flow south.\nc) north: North wind brings cold air to the coast in winter and will cool things down.\nd) east: Sea breezes tend to make the wind move from land towards the sea. The sea acts as a cooler. This will be opposite in summer when land has heated. Wind will blow up from sea and hit coastal regions warmed by summer.\ne) centre: A center wind blows air from everywhere but does not focus on a certain point.\nAnswer: (A) West\n\nInput:  Many animals avoid hot temperatures in the same way humans do, by going?

Since the choice is to hunt for food, we can exclude options \"thank god\" and \"sleep\" as the person is not going to god or taking a nap (sleep). \n6. \"Prepare to go\" is not necessarily preparing to go somewhere to get food, for all we know the person intends to go find food in the nearest town. Therefor, we can eliminate it as well.\n7.

An accurate analysis of the choices will reveal which is better.\n1. To analyze the choices, first start by looking at each choice and see if you would use the same choice for the given situation.\n2. Then, you should see which choices have the most common elements that you could use. Here are the following common elements you will see in the choices:\na. Plan: In depth analysis, careful planning, detailed plans\nb. Gut: quick decisions, instincts, sudden impulses\n3. Now, it is important to note that each choice has its pros and cons. The reason for this question is to analyze what is better based on the given situation. For example, you will likely hear \"don't plan, trust your gut\", but is it always really that easy to go with our instincts. Do we always trust them? If so, do we really trust them completely in any situation? Are we always good at making a decision? Can we even make a decision quick enough if it needs to be quick (eg. you just need to know the answer quick). Is time really that valuable in each situation?\n4. The first two choices (Planning and gut) are similar in the way that they are both quick decisions. Therefore, to understand which is better, compare plan and gut on the pros and cons of each choice: Plan has a pro to being detailed in planning and is thoughtful, whereas the gut has a pro to being spontaneous", "answer": "A: attic"}

This can be physical objects like objects or jewelry etc.\n3. There are four options to this question:\nfront, back, both, and center.\n4. The question specifically mentions \"heart,\" which would be synonymous with \"feelings\", which refers to emotions, and not the physical region of the body.\n5.

Choices:  a) run forever   b) have everlasting strength c) be as smart as you are d) be perfect  e) know all the facts f) be just like you\nRationales:\n\n1. First, let's understand the types of things one might be asking about when given the option of \"what can people not do?\"\n\n2. Then, let's understand what qualities could be asked about when it comes to things people can't do.\n\n\n\n3. Option a is \"run forever.\" Though technically it is a thing, it would be inappropriate for the sentence and certainly should not be considered a thing that cannot be accomplished.\n\n4. Option b is a thing called \"having everlasting strength,\" which is a little vague as a quality that someone wouldn't have.\n\n5. Option c is a thing called \"being as smart as you.\" It's not a thing that people can't necessarily do, even if it is a little bit exaggerated.\n\n6. Option d is a thing called \"perfection.\" We want to keep in mind that perfection cannot be accomplished, not even by the best of people, including the speaker in the sentence.\n\n7. Option e is a thing called \"know all the facts.\" The speaker might be suggesting that all the facts are known, as opposed to knowing all the facts, so we'll remove this option for now because we're not looking for a fact that nobody knows.\n\n8. Finally, we're left with option f: \"be just like you.\" This is a very specific thing that isn't a fact that everyone knows, but is instead something they can't necessarily do.\n\n9. Thus, the answer would be correct if the word for \"like\" were replaced with \"exactly as you,\" so the answer would be option f, \"be exactly as you.\" In other words", "answer": "C: surface of earth"}

However, neither option covers what a baby can do when it is bored.\nTherefore, we need to consider which of the following should not happen if the baby is bored.\n\nOption A is incorrect.  It is possible that a baby may not understand why there is no one to play with, or why the parent is not entertaining them. A baby that is too young to understand will not necessarily become too bored.\n\nThe other options cover all possible behaviors of babies when they aren't being entertained.

Whenever I do shout during the bad times, my granddad would what? Choices: A: yell B: talk about it C: tell me not to do it D: ask what's wrong E: distract me\nRationales: The answer can be deduced from the context that my granddad is a support to me during bad times. So, the question expects a choice that supports a person during hard times.\nThe choice options are A-D - \"yell, talk about it, tell me not to do, ASK WHAT'S WRONG\", which are different from supporting a person during hard times and not an option.

By contrast, there's no guarantee of receiving food if we prepare to go, so that's not a possible solution.

Choices: A: cat B: mouse C: deer D: bird E: human\nRationales: In this question, a small, inanimate object is asked to be described as something larger/bigger than itself. To do this, the size of the object is compared to something bigger. For instance, the cat is bigger than the mouse and the deer is bigger than the mouse.\n\nAnswer: Since the ant is an insect, we can assume that it's smaller than a human. While the bird is bigger than the cat, it is not bigger than the cat+ant, so it cannot be the answer. To know the ant's size, we compare  it to other creatures, like a mouse. By doing this, we discover that the ant is smaller than a mouse. We can deduce that the ant is smaller in size than a mouse, which is a small, inanimate creature. So, the answer could not be C, D, or E. However, the correct answer could be B, Cat. \n\nAnswer: B: cat\n\nInput: A friend is a special person who is in your life but not part of your family. Other examples of a friend include neighbors and co-workers. Someone who has always shared everything with you is your...

The person who has shared everything is not a best friend since the best friend can be an enemy of the person who has shared everything.\nB: Enemy is a correct alternative to describe someone who has shared everything. It is better than the alternatives since the enemy can be a best friend of the person who has been there for everything and the best friend can be the enemy of the person who had shared everything. Thus the enemy is better than the best", "answer": "B: oxygen"}

Choices:  C: water  B: sewage treatment plants  B: oceans  C: soil  E: garbage\nRationales: The first thing to understand in this question is the meaning of \"food web\" - it is a web of food chains where different creatures have a relationship with their food sources.\nThe given choices are:\n  * Water - an element on the Earth's surface.\n  * Soil - a layer of material which provides support to plants.\n  * Garbage - any unwanted or unusable substance, often referred to as \"trash\".\n  * Sewage treatment plants - places where sewage (wastewater from toilets or other facilities) is treated.\n  * Oceans - the area of water on the planet's surface that is covered by saltwater.\nTherefore, as you work through the possible answers, you can eliminate them in order of increasing plausibility using the following criteria:\n  1. Water, garbage, and garbage are all substances that food webs do not consist of - they're not \"food\", so they are eliminated. \n  2. Since all of the animals eat other animals, the only option that does not involve eating is \"water\".

Choices: A: fresh air  B: light  C: nutrients  D: a constant supply of blood  E: moisture\nRationales: Eyes consist of the iris and the pupil. The iris is a coloured muscle that controls the size of the pupil, allowing more light to reach the retina (the part of the eye that allows eyes to see).\nLet's begin by ruling out any choices that exclude the pupil or the iris at any time, or both, from the iris being the most notable part of dogs' and wolves' eyes.\nA: fresh air is a given, light is controlled", "answer": "D: africa"}

If you can't find any contextually relevant verb, it doesn't matter if the other choices are gramatically correct, they're not the answer.\n3. None of the other choices match the context, so the correct answer would still be E: multilingual.\n4. Although there is a contextually relevant verb in the choice, it's worded in an ambiguous way, where there's no indication that it's a verb, so this isn't the answer.\n5. Note that in order to choose the answer to this question, it is not necessary to know that being multilingual means being able to use more than one language.

When it's your turn you are asked what you are carrying. What is it? Choices:  a)a backpack b)a suitcase c)a handbag d)a carryon bag e)not a bag!\nRationales: Firstly, we make sure we understand exactly what is being asked here and how we should be approaching the question - this will help save time and increase marks.\n1. We make an assumption, that it is referring to a large suitcase or bag that you don't put down in between all the security procedures.\n2. Secondly, we need to examine the choices.\n3. We can eliminate the option of not a bag! - this is a pretty logical choice, no bag, no carryon. Therefore it is clear that this is not the answer.\n4. Now we examine the choice of A) a backpack.\n5. This can be done as all the remaining choices are similar in size and type.\n6. Therefore we can confidently eliminate A) a backpack as the answer.\n7. Now remaining are all relatively similar in size and type - it is really down to which one has the most baggage.\n8. Thus we eliminate B)a suitcase, a bag can certainly have suitcases in it.\n9. Further to point 8 we must remember, this is not a simple choice of a bag, it is all about the carryon bag.\n10.

{"text": "refers to actively acquiring food is \"hunt for food\". This suggests that preparing to go, sleeping, and thanking the individual's creator does not necessarily solve food insecurity.\n5. Although 'hunting' may involve thanking one's god, it more immediately leads to the acquisition of food rather than prayer. Similarly, although sleeping may be induced by hunger, it does not necessarily indicate the action of acquiring food.\n6. There is no context which requires the person to feel humiliated, so the remaining choice is to either go hunting for food or thank their god for providing them with sustenance. Although this choice lacks context, the answer is more likely to be hunted as it is the most action-oriented choice.\nAnswer: A(hunted): hunt for food\n\nInput: Lydia's father is a doctor.

However, as shown in below image, we know the reason behind the elephant that \"we call an elephant a elephant when we can call it anything.\" The elephant is called an elephant because it eats elephants and the elephants like the word elephant.\n\n![An Elephant Is Called Elephant Because It Eats Elephants](https://i.imgur.com/4RPZf6i.png)\n\nInput: Which of the two options best describes how the United Kingdom treats refugees?

They started offering a rebate, and the rebate increased the product's sales dramatically. What was their mistake? Choices:  [A]: Not advertising B: not being competitive with lower prices C: too small D: Not offering a sufficient rebate E: all of the above\nRationales: The question poses the scenario in which a company produced an unpopular product despite launching a rebate.\n1. In order to answer the question, we may consider the wording of the question (specifically, \"dramatically increased\"), which indicates the product's sales were inadequate without the initial rebate.\n2. We then see the options for the mistake: not advertising, not offering a sufficient rebate, too small, not being competitive with the lower price.\n3. Only option A: \"not advertising\" doesn't apply in this scenario because it is not an initial marketing strategy or a mistake.\n4. Next, eliminate option B: \"not being competitive with lower price.\" As the question does not state how competitive the product was, this option is irrelevant to the context.\n5.

First, look at the question. It says \"In what way could someone describe...\"\n2. Based on that, decide which option gives you the most specific information without leaving anything else open to interpretation.\n3. When doing that, take into consideration the exact word choice used by the original statement and the word choice possible in the answer choices.\n4. We also looked for synonyms and antonyms to see if any were a better match. \n5. We then looked at connotations of both the statement and answers to see if they aligned.\n6. We also ruled out choices that were not mentioned or hinted at.\n7. The answer is the only choice that does not describe skin at all, and it can be used to describe a scent that a person might smell after taking a shower.\n8.

E: they were of different temperament\nRationales: We have to take care of some crucial details in this question.\n\n1. We can eliminate options A and D immediately. In the options A and D, the words 'country' and 'temperament' should be understood in the context of animals, not humans, so we can eliminate these two options.\n2. We can eliminate options B because the cats are obviously cats, therefore the choice 'they didn't like each' doesn't make sense.\n\nOnly option E can be used now. The choice E describes the behavior of cats and in the litter box, 'they weren't on well' is obviously an exaggeration. 'Were of different temperament' means that they don't have the same temperament as it shows their unique qualities which don't match, for example, one cat is shy and another cat is more gregarious. So now only left with E that means the cats were different and had different kinds of temperament, they weren't on in the litter box.\nAnother question is that litter box is used for cats and not humans, how did they live in the different countries? It's a different situation if you want to ask us about \"why did they not live in the different countries?\" then you need to use some other vocabulary instead of litter box.\n\nSo therefor the answer should be E.\nAnswer: The answer is E.\n\nInput : At night the dog watches a lion.

Choices: A: wait B: make it up C: do well D: do a good job E: learn the date\nRationales: The contextual clue in the question indicates that the meeting has already been scheduled. Consequently, the person does not know when it exactly will take place.\n1. As a result of the absence of the exact date, the person must make a best guess for when the meeting will occur. Therefore, the best response is to \"make it up,\" as this indicates guessing an approximate time/date of the meeting.\n2. \"Do a good job\" would refer to a specific instance in the past, which is not relevant here.\n3. Likewise, \"wait\" does not directly answer the question in the way it is phrased.\n4. \"Learn the date,\" similarly misses the contextual requirements of a guess or best estimation of the meeting time, as opposed to learning the specific date of the meeting.\n5. \"Do well\" also does not answer the literal question, which was asking for the best response to \"be (somewhat arbitrarily) good at doing\" instead of \"being (somewhat arbitrarily)\" good. \"Do a good\" job.\nAnswer: Best guess - make it up\n\nInput: His face was wet from sweat.

E: the environmental consequences of your diet\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about the risks and benefits of meat eating. \n2. The options given are health consequences, organic, others, and environment. \n3. The risk of eating meat is that it may have an unsavory effect on your health. Similarly, the benefit of meat may be that it is a healthy choice to add to your diet if you are careful to consume it in moderation. \n4. Organics, others, and environment all have nothing specifically to do with risks and benefits of the consumption of meat. \n5. The risk of the consumption of meat is tied specifically to its effect on other animals as well as the environment. Similarly, if the effects of meat eating are only about health, then the risk and benefit is limited to that individual.\n6.

Choices: A: in a cave B: by a candle C: on the ground D: in a home E: on the sidewalk\nRationales: Understanding the context of the question is fundamental in finding the correct answer. The main focus of the scenario is to find a man-made fire.\nFirst, identify the possible locations mentioned, with the context of the question.\n1. Cave: A cave is likely not to have any man-made fire. This is due to no possibility of an open flame in a cave with many stones. Even if there was a fire, it was likely unstoppable and dangerous. Although a fire was possible, it was not likely due to the location. \n2. Candle: A candle is a man-made fire, but the question asks for \"where\" first man-made fire occurred.\n3. Home: A home has potential for the first man-made fires. A home would have people, and they would be able to cook. \n4. On the ground/On the sidewalk: These locations are not likely to have a man-made fire since there is not enough protection from stones to ignite a fire.\n5. There are not many options for \"where did the first man- made fire occur?\".

Choices:  The reason ice is slippery is that it has a high specific ______________ compared to its mass. The options below are not the correct ones. \nA. surface area\nB. density\nC. friction\nD. hardness\nE. water temperature\nRationales:\n1. First, consider each option individually.\n2. Option A: water temperature. Water temperature has nothing to do with ice being slippery.\n3. Option B: Density. Density is not necessarily a measure of slipperiness and does not necessarily have anything to do with ice being too slippery in the first place.\n4. Option C: friction. Friction can be a factor for something becoming slippery such as in ice skating, but it's not the sole reason for why ice is slippery.\n5. Option D: hardness. Hardness has nothing to do with slipperiness in general.\n6. Finally option E: specific surface area. The specific surface area of ice to water ratio is 1.5. This means the specific surface area of ice is much higher than its overall liquid surface area. This wouldn't cause something to be slippery unless it were significantly smaller than the area it was on.\n7. Therefore the answer is E. Ice's specific", "answer": "D: evaluating"}

It's a bit like saying \"You drive that piece of shit, don't you\" that means Choices:  A) you are a bad driver B) you drive a piece of shit C) you're cool D) you're ugly\nRationales:\nFirst, read the question. There are multiple statements that can lead to a similar conclusion by eliminating the \"that means\" portion and substituting it with \"people think that your car is ugly because of who they think you are\" or \"what I mean is people think that your car is a piece of junk because you are a loser.\"\nThe key to finding the answer is understanding the difference between the sentences in their original and substituted form.\n\nWhen looking at the original sentence, you come up with a list of statements that you think are relevant to the meaning. For instance, we can consider that people believe your car is ugly not because they believe your car is ugly but instead the thought \"people are bad at expressing that your car sucks ass but they'd really like to drive something decent\" is relevant.\nIn that case, we can then take the original sentence and substitute it with any of those statements and the result will be relevant to the true meaning but won't be the original sentence in its entirety because the original sentence contains a hidden meaning within each word.\nThese hidden meanings have a different meaning in their original context and could mean different things in a different situation.\n\nWhen looking for an answer, you have to be willing to question everything and try to figure out what each word means in the context of the sentence, instead of simply memorizing a definition or explanation.\nFor instance, if you are told that \"it's not that people are dumb but that they think you're ugly,\" you might think that a simple way of answering it is to eliminate the word \"dumb\" because it doesn't make sense as it stands there.\nHowever, doing this would remove an essential piece of information because a \"", "answer": "D: room"}

We're trying to determine which option is the most likely to be a way that a leader being a good one can bring happiness to the people they are leading.\nStep 2. When you're looking through the choices, make sure you are keeping your goal in mind (to find a way that a leader can bring happiness to the group they're leading).\nStep 3.

Now, read the choices and eliminate the ones that don\u2019t actually seem to be associated with either of the two options. This can be done by reasoning about what \u201cgood leader\u201d usually means. A good leader can be defined as somebody who manages a team, so the ones that aren\u2019t relevant to a leader managing the whole team or an important part of the team can be eliminated by this reasoning alone.\nStep 6.

Among the two options \"You're aBad Friend\" and \"You're a Good Friend,\" the latter is a better fit \u2013 it is in line with the idea that the person is mute and will therefore not hear the message with \"you're a bad friend\".\n5. As for the second choice \"You have a Bad Friend\", the context doesn't quite fit as mute people can not be said to have a bad friend since they can't actually tell that their friend is bad, so they don't have the ability to judge and say so.  Hence, \"I have a bad friend\" makes more sense in this case.\n6. So, the final answer should be \"I have a Bad Friend\" since this is the only other option that satisfies the criteria given by the question and there is only one option among the set of choices.\nFinal Step: Option E: \"I have a bad Friend\" is thus the only option that matches the given circumstances and solves the issue while also being the only option of the few given.", "answer": "E: cellar"}

Examples are smooth muscles and cardiac muscles.\nFast tissues are those where the cell (muscles) needs to contract suddenly due to a command or because there is a need to do some sort of work (movement is a type of work). Examples are skeletal muscles which are attached to skeleton. \nFew tissues are made up of both type of muscles for example triceps muscles which are located near the elbow.

This matches the expectation that one statue is definitely taller than the other one, but we are also expecting a person to visit the taller statue and be surprised the other way around.\n3. It must be either A: Surprising, B: Amazing, C: Astonishing, or E: Unbelievable.\n4. One option that doesn't fit these expectations is \u2018Unbelievable\u2019.\n5. Hence it is not the correct answer as people are expected to be surprised by the higher number of visitors to the taller statue.\n6. Another option that doesn't seem to fit the expectations is D: Unsurprising. The taller statue attracted more visitors; hence it should be surprising.\n7. Another option that doesn\u2019t match the expectation is B: Amazing. People can be amazed by the result but they don\u2019t expect the result, so it isn\u2019t surprising.\n8. We can now eliminate these answers, which leaves us with three options:\nA: Surprising,\nC: Astonishing and\nE: Unbelievable\n9. This leaves us with the three options of surprising, amazing, and unbelievable.\n10. After considering each of the options, we find the answer to be E: Unbelievability.

A discussion would cover multiple related topics or angles of that topic. Therefore, the first step would be to think about the topic itself and what angle of thought should be shared or discussed.\nNext, consider the available answers to that question: global warming, a second job, gender role, health insurance, and the price of gas.\n\nNow answer the question from the perspective of the individual speaking. \nThe question asks \"I am interested in your thoughts about the (topic),\" which can be translated as \"I want to know what you think about this issue.\"\nFrom this, it is easy to determine that the topic must be a serious one. There is no other purpose in asking that particular question.\nIt can be eliminated that the topic chosen must be related to one of the possible answers. The answer could be a personal answer or opinion on the matter.\nSo: discuss with the individual whether the option is serious, what it says about the individual's opinions, whether it pertains to the topic, how it pertains, how serious it is, or what their own perspective on the matter is.\n\nNext, the answer must be a related issue that directly relates to the topic already discussed.\nIf the topic at hand is the price of gas, the answer should be related to the price of gas, either directly or indirectly.\nHence, the answer is E. the price of the gas.\nAnswer: E. the price of gax\n\nInput: Is a tough-love parent who never says \"I Love You\" to their child in their right mind?

From context we can observe that the type of fishing is the'main type', which implies that out of all the types of fishing, the one the most people engage in is the main type.\n2. Based on the provided choices, the word 'commercial' does not explain angling as it can relate to fish farming and processing which are not directly associated with angling; instead, it implies that the fishing is of commercial purpose, which is not directly suggested by the'main type' phrasing.\n3. Similarly, 'industrial' is a broader category of fishing that encompasses a range of purposes, including commercial, recreational, and tourist fishing, which again do not directly support angling.\n4. The word'saltwater' also does not directly reflect the main type of fishing, though its association with the coast suggests a location where angling is likely to take place.\n5.

This option does not emphasize the specific nutritional value of the food itself.\nD: \"make sure they have enough to  choose from'' This option suggests that if children are given a variety of foods to choose from, they will eat properly.\nE: \"make sure it is high in nutrients'' - this option is closer to the original question than the other options given, meaning it is the best fit.

This way, we find that the two tigers are \"tigers\" not \"tigresses...\" which means they should not be affected by gender, and we also notice that they are either alone or in a pack because the verb \"encounter\" implies that the two tigresses will be facing each other at some point, and not one at a time as in two other options(one solo, one in a pack).\n\nWe can then conclude that it must be the difference in feeding styles that the two tigres have to do with their different reactions in case of an encounter(one dies, one survives)... which means option E: \"tigresses aren' t as violent\" is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: E: tigress aren't as violent\n\nInput: A person who sees their own life as unimportant to the point of not having a goal is called?

What does \"why would a chef recommend\" mean? That's the key to understanding the meaning of the question.\n\nConsider the given choice. Easy to make. Tasty. Fast in the kitchen. Vegan. (Cauliflower). Note the words, \"It's...\" and then the name of something. Those are key. \"It's\" means easy to make, tasty, fast in the kitchen, vegan. And the name of something is then offered for the reader or listener to think about. In the case of the soup options, all but one are naming the soup, but the one that is not naming it is the one that is being \"recommended\".\n\nTherefore, what is not being named must be the thing being recommended. That means that the chef is recommending fast in the kitchen. However, both fast in the kitchen and vegan are non-specific. There needs to be something that a chef will be recommending. The only way that something not named can be more specific (or more detailed) than something that is named is if the not-named item is a reason for the named item.

He was what kind of person according to the description in the sentence? Choices: A: tall B: big C: dark D: bald E: angry\nRationales: The description says that the man who escaped from a bank described himself as an accountant.

Going to sleep means the person would simply fall asleep for a day or two and thus not eat, if he or she is still hungry upon waking up. Finally, the person will not actively seek food by going to prepare to go.\n5. Therefore the answer to this prompt is C: \"hunt for food\". \n6.

Choices: a. The sun to set b. The stars to appear c. The moon to rise d. The time to pass e. Winter to arrive\nRationales:1. The question is about a group of travelers who are waiting. They are not waiting for anything particularly interesting to happen\u2014the night will pass, just as always, but for some reason, they want to wait for it to come.\n\n2. Examining the choices for what the travelers are waiting for, we see that the stars coming out, though they appear during the night, is not the appropriate answer.\n3. The moon rising could be seen as waiting for the night, but the other choices also involve waiting\u2014waiting for the night, waiting for the stars to appear, waiting for the time to pass.\n4. However we need to narrow down the options to just one answer since we cannot pick a combination of options, the correct answer was therefore 'the time to pass'.\n\nAnswer: D: the time to pass \n\nInput: The problem was a terrible blizzard that trapped travelers near the North Pole.

The boss found a letter which was likely written privately for someone the author had a relationship with. The letter could not have been written for a stranger.\n1.  Reviewing the choices, A and B could both seem potential relationships if the relationship were of a casual kind. Yet, there's also no reason that the relationship could be exclusive or strong.\n2. Furthermore, D could refer to the lack of any intention to write to someone at all. An author would likely have to write to someone with the intention or hope that they would receive the letter. Yet, D does not necessarily mean this.\n3. Therefore, of the remaining choices, C is the only option which makes sense.

Choices:  I. A: Annoyed II. B: Unsure III. C: Puzzled IV. D: Angry V. E. Amused\nRationales: Choices I, III, and IV directly represent a specific emotion. Therefore, they should be eliminated.\n\nChoice II is likely a reaction to knowing what the word means and understanding the sentence that contains the word he doesn't know. It represents a level of frustration.\n\nChoice V is likely reacting to what the word sounds like. It represents a level understanding and learning. \n\nHe's most likely 'puzzled', which aligns with the context.

Choices: A: bunny B: chick C: egg D: mama E: papa\nRationales: The question is asking for a generic name for a baby rabbits that could be applicable to any rabbit.\n\nStep 1: Start by looking at the options individually.\nStep 2: Bunny is the generic term for a baby rabbit.\nStep 3: Chick is the correct gender neutral term for a rabbit, since no gender-based term (egg or papa) applies to a baby rabbit. Additionally, chick is short for chicken; if the baby rabbit is a chicken, then its generic term would be chick and not bunny.\nStep 4. The term Mama refers to a female rabbit, and Papa refers to a male rabbit.\nStep. Since rabbits belong to the animal kingdom, any baby rabbits have to belong to a mama and papa.\n\nStep 5: All of the options given can be associated with rabbits.\nStep 6 Mama, papa and chick refer to rabbits for example, a baby rabbit is called chick as stated before.\nStep 7.

A: freedom B: a right C: power D: a chance E: more\nRationales: To address this question, define the term \"last\". When we say that we're saying someone gives them a last chance, we are giving them one last opportunity to avoid punishment or something that we find unacceptable.\n\nWe can then look at the words \"last chance\" and break them down into three terms: \"last\" means \"one\" or \"only.\" \"Chance\" means \"a short period of time.\" \"Last chance,\" therefore, means \"a brief period of time,\" which is what we would refer to an \"opportunity\" or \"chance.\"\n\nNext, evaluate the choice A: \"freedom.\" You do gain a freedom when you receive this second chance, but more importantly, you're being invited to exercise a freedom (by exercising your ability to choose to apologize or not). Therefore, A is not the intended answer to the question.\n\nConsidering the remaining options, 1. You use the right to apologize and 2. you receive power (to choose).\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. E is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: Sam and Mike have been friends for a long time, they also have the same friends. This fact suggests what about them? Choices:\n\n1.

Choices: 1A: private A: public 2B: individual B: collective 3C: free D: subsidiary E: state\nRationales: Start by breaking down the question. Capitalism describes the economy that primarily is based on private property.\n1. Next, take note of which form of capitalism the question asks about: Private capitalism. This means the type of capitalism that only takes place in a private setting, and not collectively or socially or otherwise.\n2. Considering this, we can eliminate several of the given choices: \"A: public,\" which means public ownership where property is held by the state, \"B: collective,\" which describes a socialized economy where resources are collectively owned and \"C. free,\" which is a type of capitalism that focuses on the individual.\n3. Thus, the only choices to left are \"D: subsidiary,\" from where a large company owns smaller, subsidiary companies, and \"E:state,\" which is where governments hold the property or assets. \n4. The choice that fits the best is \"D: subsidiaries.\"  This choice fits because many companies who own a subsidiary hold ownership of it privately.  In this scenario, individual owners own the majority of the company and control it, which fits the private capitalism definition we discussed earlier.  This choice is the only remaining option that makes sense.\nAnswer: D.\n\nInput: Who is a pioneer of music?

Therefore, since there is no explicit method that allows access to food, we can conclude that the person did not immediately gain any food or solve the problem of being hungry.\nAnswer: D is the correct answer because the other choices don't give the person food after they are hungry, only solutions for how to make oneself feel better after being hungry.

Choices:  You must do it now-E If not, it will never happen-B If not, it will happen next year-A You will never find happiness-C I don't know\nRationales: \"Will you find Happiness\" can be answered by \"Can you find happiness\" and thus to do this, you need to understand what is happiness? You need to know what the question is asking for. The answer choices are about happiness. Since the question can be interpreted as what will you do to be happy, the answer is to \"do it now\".

Start by reading the choices to gain a general understanding of what they represent.\n3. Look at the context of the question and note the words which might affect answer choice: \"a good one\", \"a lot of money\", \"one in a million\", \"a lot of time\", and \"little fun\".\n4. Consider that \"a lot of time\" refers to an extremely long time in contrast with the other choices.\n5. Consider that \"fun\" describes activities or things that someone enjoys doing.\n6. Option A: A \"good one\" is comparative to the other choices. It implies the possibility of one choice being better than the others, but not necessarily the other choices being bad.\n7. Option B: \"A lot of money\" is less comparative than other choices because someone can have a lot of money without necessarily being good at something or being the best in the world at one very specific thing.\n8. Option C: \"One in a million\" is a comparative choice, as the question states which is the best out of: One in a million, a lot of time, a lot of money, a lot of fun, a good one. \n9.

Choices:  persistence A: determined B: willpowerful C: optimistic D: optimistic E: resourceful\nRationales: Start with 'tenacity', which means to hold firmly to a purpose, so a person with tenacity would want to continue to work towards their goal.\n1. The other choices'steadfast','resilient', and 'determined' all fit well with this theme. They're synonyms that describe a person who holds firmly to a purpose.\n2. 'willpowerful' would also fit along these lines, but it's less relevant to the situation. It's not clear how it would be used given the person's tenacity or how it would indicate strength of purpose.\n3. Finally,'resourceful' is not synonymous with holding firmly to a purpose but implies that a person is able to find or use resources. Resourceful individuals may work with tenacity to achieve their goals, but the word 'tenacity' doesn't indicate resourcefulness.\n4.

Similarly, \"8\" is not a 'favorite' number as there are many other numbers that are considered favorite, as stated in the question.\n3. That leaves us only with the remaining number choices: 6, 7, or 9.\n4. \"6\" and \"7\" are both commonly considered as 'favorite' numbers and would be appropriate answers.\n5. Like \"7\", \"9\" is a number commonly used or known as a favorite number, and therefore a suitable answer.\n6. Therefore the answer must be one of \"6\", \"7\" and \"9\" which are frequently and commonly known as favorites.\n7.

It is also unclear that options A and B \"feel humiliated\" and \"thank god\" respectively will alleviate hunger.\n7. Furthermore, option D, \"feel humiliatd\", is not a viable solution to hunger, due to the fact that hunger is not considered a source of shame, and the fact that hunger may cause emotions of despair.\n8.

He needed to find a word that means behaving in a way that other people want or expect. Which word best fills in this blank? Choices:  ________\nRationales: The sentence states that Sam was thinking of his friends' behavior. If he needs to find a word or phrase that would describe such behavior to others, then he presumably was concerned with how they behaved in front of others and not in private, for instance at home in bed.\nThe options are therefore:\n\nA. behave appropriately\nB. act properly\nC. show restraint\nD. maintain decorum\nE. comport oneself well\n\nFrom A to E, we can determine that\n\n1. \"properly\" suggests that the behavior is appropriate and acceptable in public. Thus, a) is not appropriate.\n2. \"restraint\" implies to show self-control or discipline.

Choices A: the sun B: the woods C: humans D: a tiger E: humans\nRationales: Start by carefully considering each answer and determining how each option explains the context of the question.\n1. The question asks about an animal that lives in the woods and is afraid of a particular thing.\n2. Choice B: The woods isn't a thing, so it doesn't answer the question.\n3. Similarly choice C: Humans is a people not a thing, so it can't be the correct answer.\n4. If a \"something\" is afraid of a tiger, it would most certainly be afraid of the tiger. In the same way, if the something is afraid of both the woods and humans, it's most likely afraid of humans.\n5.

Choices A: beautiful B: graceful C: tall D: thin E: elegant\nRationales: By analyzing the information given in the question, it is clear that the duck can't describe a swan, and the human can.\nStart by understanding why a duck cannot describe a swan. A swan is a long-necked bird that lives near water, while ducks actually live in the water and eat seeds. This means that they wouldn\u2019t ever see a swan, as swans do not live near water. Swans are also quite different in appearance from ducks and don\u2019t have a lot of physical traits", "answer": "B: tomb"}

Choices: A: memorize B: be able to demonstrate C: not do what it takes to get the role D: get a role E: be sure you are selected\nRationales: There are some simple rules to apply. The question begins with \"If you go to an audit...\" which means the word \"go\" is the verb that must be conjugated. Therefore, \"go\" is the base verb.\nSince we are dealing with an audition with a singular subject and a plural meaning, we have to use the verb in the singular form. Hence, we have two choices to make the question make sense, A and B. \"going\" is the opposite form of \"getting.\" Therefore A is incorrect since it refers to something you already did.\nIf you \"B\" do what it takes to \"get the role,\" then you would already have the role.\nTherefore, D is wrong too.\nC is another possibility.  However, it is a very specific situation.  Someone goes on audition but doesn't succeed, so this doesn't quite fit with the statement of this question.\nAs for choice E, \"be sure you are selected\" is incorrect too because \"be sure\" is the opposite of \"getting the role.\"\nIf you are sure of being selected, you haven't gotten the role and the question is talking about auditions in the present tense.\nTherefore, the only correct option is B.\nThe answer is B.

This question is asking what was likely wrong in order to further understand the events that take place.\nWith the woman and three dogs, this suggests there may have been either a problem with the dogs or the woman, or both. \nFurther, Paul seeing the woman crying, and the woman being on patrol would indicate Paul was a part of a patrol. \nTherefore, the possible reasons of why the woman was on patrol alongside Paul and crying were as the patrol was too noisier, and that one of her dogs had escaped which caused her anxiety, or that she was worried about her dogs' food.\nAmong these choices, 'the patrol was too loud' doesn't make sense because patrols typically make loud noises while on patrol. Also, dogs are often trained to make noise when they find someone. If the patrol were too loud, one of her dogs wouldn't be making sound to attract her toward their location. In addition, if the patrol were too noisy, one of the dogs would have been scared to go on patrol with its owner.\nAlso, the fact that she had three dog indicates that the dog who escaped was most likely not her favorite one and so it might have been a case of one of her dogs escaping which added to her worries or her worries about her dogs' food as her dogs could be barking or making noise because they could be hungry.\n\n\nConsequently, the answer would be 'a: one of her dogs had already escaped that she might have been wor", "answer": "B: getting full"}

John is lazy\nRationales: Each of the answers given describes the reasons for why John cannot be likely or qualified for the job of becoming the CEO of a company.\n\n1. By analyzing each answer, we can see that they all describe negative qualities and characteristics that make John unable to be a suitable choice for a CEO. However, these factors are vague and do not provide specific evidence regarding why John is likely to fail in becoming a CEO.\n\n2. We evaluate each answer by considering the following questions:\n\nDoes this answer clearly state what is making it unlikely that John should become a CEO?\n\nDoes this answer provide evidence to support its reasoning for why becoming a CEO is unlikely for John?\n\nDoes this option provide an example to support its explanation of why John is unlikely to become the CEO?\n\nIf you answer these questions no to any of them, then that answer is not the best solution. Let me elaborate.\n\n3. Based on this process, we can conclude that the only answer that provides specific evidence regarding why John would not be likely for the position is B: \"The company has financial problems\". This option explains that the company might not be able to provide the financial support that John would need in order to be the CEO.\n\n4. Therefore, the best choice is B: \"The companies financial problems\" since the option provides specific evidence about why John would not be a suitable candidate for the position.\n\nAnswer: B: The companies financial problems\n\nInput: Everyone around him felt that John was weak minded, but why would the judge make a case against John?

D: conartist 5. E: con man\nRationales: Start by understanding the context behind the question: \"Many people, from over time, lose money\"\nE.g., people may lose money because they gambling, to a stockbroker, from a boss, to a con-artist, to a con man.\n1. Understanding the meaning of the terms, a gambler is someone who regularly plays games of chance. \n2. A stockbroker is a person who buys and sells stocks and shares. \n3. A boss is a person who supervises or directs an individual, team, or department in an organization. A boss often sets expectations and goals for staff. \n4. A con-artist is a dishonest person, typically a swindler who may con others (especially the naive) out of money, property or other valuable possessions. They may also defraud others out of money by selling useless or fraudulent items and claiming that they are genuine items. \n5. A con man, however, refers to someone who deceives others for gain or personal benefit. Though they could be a con-artist who uses their skills to deceive others, this word specifically also refers to scamming those around you. \n6. In this context, people could lose money to all five of the choices from over time: to a gambler, stockbroker, boss, conartist, or con-man. \n7. Among which five choices, only the con-man refers to people who scam others in the form of swindling money. \n8. Therefore, the answer to this question is E: con-mand. \n\nAnswer: D: Con-man\n\nInput: You are standing on a boat in a stream. The stream carries what?

It might be a symptom, but it is not an action that will alleviate hunger.\n7. Similarly, choice C \"sleep\" only postpones hunger, but it does not resolve the problem.\n8.

Furthermore, the questions explicitly ask for the ingredient that is in the chocolate cakes that the asker loves the most.\n4. The last piece of information given is that the cake that is chocolate and the asker loves it the most contains a cream.\n5. This tells us which cake the asker loves, chocolate.\n6.

A: still sitting B: in the yard C: already stolen D: completely stripped E: straw\nRationales:\n1. Identify the question: Where was the company at the point when it was stolen from?\n2. After identifying the problem, look at the three remaining options: \u201c...a tractor at which stage?\u201d\n3. Going through the options, you can see that option D describes a situation, not a stage, and is therefore excluded.\n4. Now the question becomes: \u201c...where was the company at the time the tractor was stolen?\u201d\n5. You can eliminate options A: \u201cstill sitting\u201d and option C: \u201cin the yard\u201d because you still need to know where the tractor was stollen from.\n6. Option E: \u201cstraw\u201d is not applicable because it does not provide as specific a situation as option B: \u201ccompletely stripped\u201d.\n7. Finally, looking at the information in the question again, it is clear that the stolen money cannot possibly have been from a completely stripped tractor, because \u201csixty-two million dollars\u201d is an enormous amount to steal.\n8.

The adjective phrase 'physical condition' generally refers to the person's health and fitness.\n3. Looking at the options given, the third category'middle-aged' does not make much sense here as it simply divides the age into two halves. Also, the first and fourth categories of 'adolescent' and 'old age' are irrelevant to the context of the question. It doesn't say the context is related to how the person feels or looks, or about their age.\n4. Next, look at each category, with '35-year-olds' in mind. Adolescence typically refers to an age between 13 and 18. This excludes a 35-year old. Also,'mature' could refer to a person who is considered old, but that is not applicable in this case.\n5.

He makes everyone laugh, but people's jokes are more likely to hit home when they are how? Choices: 1. funny B: funny-talk C: witty D: clever E: subtle\nRationales: The question asks about the type of humor that's most likely to hit home when aimed at the clown. The clown has been presented as a joker and jokes are often referred to as hitting home when they're effective. That means a joke needs to be more than just funny to do well, which is further explained in the choices: witticism, humor, jokery, and banter. The key word is 'laugh', which means only jokery makes one laugh. To make people laugh is more than just being witty or clever, a person has to be a joker. The personality trait of clowns that includes jokery is called joviality. That trait is only applicable to clowns and has no relation to funny-talk (another funny trait). Wittiness and cleverness tend to be highly individual and unique traits. Clever can be used only as an adjective or as a noun for people, which means it's difficult to use clever as an adverb. Subtlety is a noun denoting delicate sensibility and discretion, suggesting that a joker is someone who likes subtle humor, and therefore is not jokery. The funniness of options 1 and 2 is not discussed as humor or funniness will hit home without being jokery. So, only two choices could possibly make people laugh and have to do with jokery, so the answer is 3. As a result, the answer is 3: jokery, as jokery makes people laugh a lot and can have a major impact.

In the choices given, the two options 'they don't get to work with so many rules and regulations' and 'they aren't good interacting with people', describe the reason as to why people don't prefer to become servers or work as such. \n3. The choice 'they don't want a high salary' does not describe the reason as to when people don't prefer working as servers; since it gives people a lot of satisfaction, it's normal for people to aspire to get a lot of money, if possible and desired. \n4. The choice 'they want to learn new skills' does describe the reason to a certain extent, however, it is specific to the aspect of learning new skills, and the question does not ask to find which is the reason for people not wanting to become servers or work, so this option cannot be chosen. \n5.

Choices:  All A: the same B: one person C: the king only D: the queen only E: both\nRationales:\n1. We are looking for answers that describe the roles of both the king and the queen in a given country.\n2. Option A is false. Even though the roles of the king (and queen) can be largely redundant, they are still different.\n3. Option B is incorrect as well. While it is true that the king and the queen can have the same role, usually, the king holds a different position than the queen.\n4. Option C is false. Some queens take over the power that kings leave. In those cases that king and queen both have the same role, queen is not solely dependent on king's role.\n5. Option D is a possible choice, but this answer is based on the fact that the king is still the leader of the country, or holds more important position. So, queen can only take over king's power when he abdicates or dies.\n6. Option E is a possible choice for the answer as well, as both king and queen can have distinct roles depending on the law of their country.\n7. Hence, none of the four choices given in the choices are correct.\n8. Therefore answer D: The queen is ONLY the king only is the right answer.\nAnswer: D. The Queen is ONLY the King Only\n\nInput: When two people see different things. The disagreement is over what?

Choices: 1: Old, wealthy persons, or 2: Young, wealthy persons.\nRationales:\n1. Step 1: We can determine by the question alone that someone who is old and wealthy is more likely to be robbed than someone who is young and wealthy.\n2. Step 2: To understand what each choice means, we should look at each one individually:\n3. Choice 1: Old, Wealthy persons : Old is a relative term. The person of a certain age could be young or old. Therefore, they could be young and wealthy, old and wealthy, or neither.\n4. Therefore option 1 cannot be the correct choice.\n5. Choices 2: Young, Wealthy Persons: Young is a relative term. Although the person of a certain age, be  the person young, old, or both, would still be considered young.\n6. Therefore, option 2 cannot be the correct choice as it would include the person who is old but still considered young.\n7. Hence based on the available options, the correct choice is (old, wealthy persons).\nAnswer: (old, wealthy perso\n\nInput: All of the answers below except the correct one are incorrect.

Use an oven- This does not make any sense as it doesn\u2019t explain how the bread is baked.\n2. Put yeast in the frour- Yeast is a type of fungus that is sometimes added to bread, but it does not explain how the bread is actually made.\n3.

Bake the boards in oven\nInput: You know a lot about cooking, what kinds of skills does it teach you? Choices: cooking  cooking techniques  taste  cooking skills  smell\nRationales: The question mentions that the person knows about cooking, which suggests that the person is someone who may have studied in a culinary school, or may be well-known for their ability to make great food, or may be a cook or chef.\nOne of the choices that the person could teach you is cooking techniques.\nCooking skills, taste and smell would all affect how the dish turns out, but they might be considered \"sub-skills\" of cooking. Cooking techniques might be considered more difficult and nuanced than the other choices. Choice 3 seems to be more directly related to the question, whereas Choices 1&2 don\u2019t seem related.

Choices: 1. A: circular 2. A: branched 3. A: one chamber per lobe 4. A: two chambers per lobe 5. A: five lobes 6. A: no lobes\nRationales: The first step is understanding the context of the answers given.\nThe question asserts that someone has given 'an accurate way' to describe this.\n\nThe second step involves understanding the term'structure' of something.\nBased on the information from step one, it is clear that we will want to understand the structure of the lung's chambers.\n\nThe third step is to consider the options given.\nEach option is associated with a different structure of the lungs.\n\nThe last step is to select the appropriate choice based on the context and the options given.\nBased on our analysis above, the answer must be 5.\nThe lungs only have five lobes, where other choices describe six or more.\nThe option describing two chambers per lube is not applicable, as the lung's structure was specifically defined as having five lobes.\n\nAnswer choices 1 and 2 are not accurate in terms of describing the structure of the lube.\nThe lung's structure is 'two chambers per lobes', therefore those two choices are incorrect.\n\nThe fourth choice is not accurate in terms of the lung's structure, as the lung' one lobe is not evenly divided by two chambers. \nThe lung's one lobe will have multiple chambers.  The word 'each' as well as the use of 'chamber' in each location suggest that the answer should describe a lobe divided into two equal sections.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 5.\nAnswer: A 5: five lobes\n\nInput: The question states that one's house got robbed, the neighb", "answer": "E: big house"}

Choices:  a. curvilinear shapes b. geometric shapes c. polygonal shapes d. spherical shapes \nRationales: Given the choices, spherical shapes are a type of geometric shapes because they have a smooth curved surface that does not contain any angles.\nSimilarly, circular shapes can also be categorized under the polygonal shapes, geometric shapes, spherical shapes, and curvilinear shapes because they have either rounded or angular edges.\n\nAnswer: C: polygonal shapes\n\nInput: A pink ball is an example of what  color?

Choices:  A. Efficiently B. Quickly C. Flawlessly D. Thoroughly E. Beautifully\nRationales:\n1. The question asks us to choose the best answer.\n2. As we are given an instruction, the options we have to pick from are in a set.\n3. We are to choose between options, not between a group of words.\n4. Start off by eliminating a poor choice because it uses an inappropriate form of the word \"to do.\"\n5. Option A is incorrect because \"efficient\" is an adjective and does not answer the question about something that the leader does.\n6. Option E is incorrect because it uses an inaccurate word choice and lacks the meaning of an imperative from the phrase \"to do quickly.\"\n7. As we try to determine the meaning of the phrase from an imperative, we are able to infer that the options that contain imperative words are \"thorough\" and \"thoughtful\". Both require more than one action to bring an outcome.\n8. Option B is incorrect because efficiency should not be the sole concern.\n9. Option D is incorrect because one action is not enough to bring full completion of everything.\n\n10. The remaining options are of comparable magnitude and qualities.

Choices: A: last job B: one before C: previous D: current E: current job\nRationales: There is some ambiguity in the phrase 'last job'. A 'last job' can refer to a previous job, or it can refer to the job the person is in now.\nIt is possible to have had 'the last job' one had, but not to like it, and still like the job that one has now.\nEither way, the answer cannot be 'last job' because 'the last job' was just a suggestion of what the job could be - the statement only needs to include 'it's more interesting than'.\nAfter eliminating 'last job' from the candidates, the only choice that makes sense is E: current job because it is the only one currently in view without the confusion of other interpretations.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: The cat and rat have what relationship? Choices: A. are siblings B. are roommates C. are strangers D. are friends E. are enemies F. are lovers\nRationales: Choice A is incorrect because cats and rats are not siblings by definition.\nChoice B is incorrect because they are more likely to be enemies than roommates, since most rat traps seek to remove rats from homes.\nChoice D is incorrect because rats are often afraid of cats as predators. \nChoice E is incorrect because even without rodent poisons and cat traps, the instinctual natural predatory relationship of cats and rats would make them enemies, not friends.\nChoice F is incorrect because they are not lovers.\nThe only remaining options are C and F.\nChoice C,'strangers', is incorrect because, whether or not they have seen each other in person, their natural instincts are such that they should be considered enemies, not strangers.\nThus, the only answer", "answer": "C: aircraft carrier"}

First of ALL, we can see that the man is talking about something that is being \"done,\" but he states that he does not actually know who will be doing the task.\n\n2. Looking at the options, we can see that A \"you can choose\" can describe the man's task to be a choice to be made, however, it is not the same as saying that the man's choice is up to the other person. For example, the speaker says:\n\n\"It's up to you to answer the phone.\"\n\nDoes not mean that answering the phone is a choice for whoever is on the phone. It means that the person making the decision has to choose who will take the call. So, option A is out, \"you can choose.\"\n\nThe idea of \"you have to do this\" (option C) is not that the man is giving the task as a responsibility/opportunity of choice. The man knows who will be making the decision, so option B is not appropriate.

E: swap out locations and plant types each year.\nRationales: Understanding the question: The question asks what you need to do to have a crop rotation.\nEvaluating the choices: 1. The answer choice'move your plants each year on an identical day of the year' does not meet the required criteria to have a crop.\n2. 'Plants only on rows' may be an acceptable choice for someone trying to avoid certain pests or diseases in plants, such as cabbage worm caterpillars or powdery mildew.\nHowever, it is not a universal choice as it implies that the growth of a plant happens only in one direction.\n3. 'Only plant in one location' implies that there would be no movement or changes at all. Therefore, it is also an invalid choice.\n4. 'Only plant the same type of plant' is an invalid choice as it excludes varieties of a specific type of plants.\n5. The answer is E: swap out locations & plant types each year. It is the only choice that includes some change or movement in the plants or location which fulfills the criteria for crop rotation.\nAnswer: E. swap out locations and plant type every year", "answer": "B: hospital"}

Choices:   A: rich B: prosperous C: fortunate D: lucky E: wealthy\nRationales: The question refers to \"someone who has lots of money\". This suggests that they are wealthy, not rich, and that being wealthy is a result of the amount of money that a person has.\n1. Looking at the \"rich\" word, it is a term for expressing that someone has more money than most people. However, this does not directly associate to the idea of \"having lots of money\" as the question poses it.\n2. Moving onto the \"fortunate\" word. \"Fortunate\" is to describe a person as lucky or favoured. However, this does so in terms of good luck or lucky circumstances which may or may not be related to the aspect of money.\n3. Next, looking at the \"lucky\", \"luck\" or \"fortunate\" words, it can be seen that these words do not define wealth or describe \"having lots of what you want\". While this idea is true, such wealth or having \"lots of what you want\" is not always associated to having lots of money as shown with the person being rich.\n4. Moving onto the words \"wealthy\" and \"prosperous\", they refer to having \"a lot of money\". This would indicate that the definition of being wealthy is to have money or being rich, since this", "answer": "C: happiness"}

Choices:  Ask him why he's feeling sad. Laugh. Smile. Sing. Eat together. Rationales: 1: The question is what should you do to make your friend happy. 2: Looking at the other options. Asking him why he's sad is a way to try to make him feel better. But maybe he doesn't want to share that. Hence, this isn't best choice. Laughing and singing are ways to make friends feel happy, but the question is about friends, which could be more general than friends. So these may be viable options.\n3: Smiling does look like a positive choice, but it doesn't make someone feel happy (or at least not directly at all). Smiling is a small facial movement. Eating together would likely be a pleasurable experience, which could then make someone feel happy, but we don't know if that's what the question refers to.

Choices: S: able to pump B: the ability to pump C: a single unit D: hard to pump E: doesn't pump\nRationales: Start with understanding the meaning of the question being asked and the context.\n1. The question asks \"What is a person's heart able to do?\"\n2. The answer should be a description of the heart's function or use as a pump.\n3. As stated in the question, the heart is a muscle that pumps blood in the body.\n4. Looking at the available options, we already know that 'having the ability to pump' is the correct answer.\n5. A single unit only represents the individual heart, not its ability to pump.\n6. Hard to pump doesn't describe the overall ability to pump.  It refers to difficulty, and the heart's entire purpose is pumping blood throughout the body.\n7. Finally the answer, a single unit isn't even a choice.\n8.

A: bribe people B: provide incentives C: encourage D: reward E: pay people overtime\nRationales: Initially, it is important to grasp the question as it revolves around the manager wanting to increase efficiency.\n2. Then, in order to increase efficiency, rewards and incentives can be implemented, as they positively motivate individuals.\n3. Thus, the other three choices - encouraging employees, asking employees to be on task, and paying them overtime - do not directly increase efficiency.\n4. \"bribe people\" is not an option because bribery is morally questionable, and the question itself suggests the existence of a manager.\n5. Similarly, \"encouraging employees\" is not an option that aligns with increasing efficiency.\n6. \"asking employees to be on task\" can be a potential way to increase efficiency, but \"paying them overtime\" is not an option; inefficient time management is the result, not the cause:\n\n7. Thereby, the correct option is A - reward people.

Choices:  A : 3 inches B : 4 inches C : 6 inches D : 9 inches E : 12 inches\nRationales: One way to solve this problem is by finding the average height for females.  According to the United States Census Bureau, the average height of women in the United States in 2010 was 5 feet 4 inches.  Therefore, we can assume that a new graduate\u2019s height is approximately the same.\n\nBy knowing that the average height of women is 5 feet 4 Inches a and we are trying to solve for the standard deviation, we can use this information to determine how the height is spread out.  We can assume that all women are roughly the same height, as a 4-inch difference (the average standard deviation) would still allow for a wide range of heights.\n\nA standard deviation is used to show how the height is distributed.  In order to determine the standard deviation, we must add the height of all the women together (average height of 54 inches), then divide this number by the total number of people (the population of all graduates). \n\nStandard deviation in a sample is computed by this formula: [(mean \u2013 \u03bc)/\u03c3]2 + \u03bc where \u03bc is mean, \u03c3 is standard deviation, and \u201c>\u201d indicates the population.\n\nWe can plug in our values to calculate the standard deviation using the formula above.\n\n(average height = mean of sample = 5\u201911\u02ba)/\u03c3 = (5\u201911\u02b3 \u2013 \u03bc) / [\u03c3(5\u201911\u02be \u2013 \u03bc)] = (39\u02be \u2013 5\u02be4\u02be)/[12.5\u02be] = 3.2\u02be/4.65 =.68 which rounds to.7\n\nWe can round the standard deviation to.5, which we know is within one standard", "answer": "D: learn"}

What happened next? Choices: A: She stopped paying attention to the crowd's noise B: She stopped talking with her husband C: She agreed with her husband D: She realized she was distracted by the noise E: She ignored the crowd's noise\nRationales: Start by understanding that the person was distracted from her conversation with her husband by the crowd's noise. \nStep 1: Considering each choice independently, the choices can be grouped into three categories. One option is about her husband giving advice. Two other options are about her stopping or starting something.\nStep 2: Moving onto the option which suggests she's paying attention to the noise, which is B: she stopped paying attention to crowd's noise.\nStep 3: Moving to the options which say she started or stopped something, the appropriate choice is only either A or D. In this case, the choice to pay attention makes sense as she did not do so before.\nStep 4 This is because she was initially distracted before her husband tried to convine her otherwise. This option is ruled out because the husband's action did not cause the behavior that followed.\nStep 5 Finally, she ignored the noise.\nFinal Step: Therefore, we can eliminate all but one option (D: she ignored the crowd's noice) as they do not align with the situation and her behavior.\nHence, the answer is D: she ignored the crowd noice.\nAnswer: D\n\n### Explanation and tips for improvement\n\n> You can read [this guide](/discord-guide) for a better understanding of Discord.\n\nInput: Cryptocurrency transactions are verified by the network through a process called mining.

Choices:  the party the weather\nRationales: The weather is defined as a condition of the atmosphere. If the weather is rainy, this suggests that the weather is likely to have rainfall as the prevailing condition.

Make a bunch of racket 5. Be really noisy\nRationales: This Question has a few problems. First of all, it doesn't state if the snow is a blizzard, or just a few snowflakes. Next, the second option doesn't make sense and doesn't give a reason for someone to live in a neighborhood. Finally, the last option asks why someone should make a bunch of racket.

Thus, D is also ruled out. \nStep4: The answer remains between E and C. Since a person who honesty speaks the truth, thus, a person honesty should also tell the truth.

Choices:  Hobbies A:  reading B: science C: sports  D: arts\nRationales: Start by considering that a book can be considered a 'valuable item'.\n1. The item itself can be of any type.\n2. The item being valuable does not reflect the reasons behind which type of person would consider it valuable.\n3. Therefore, the provided choice space represents the different categories into which a book can belong.\n4. Reading, science, and sports represent specific subjects (reading = books, science = sciences).\n5. Arting reflects an activity (arting = art).\n6. Based on these categories, it can be noted that hobbies and arts are both activities and that they can both potentially be considered valuable to certain people.\n7. Therefore the choice space can be split into people who consider reading as valuable and those who consider arts or science as valuable.\n8. Based on this, the best answer is A: Reading because arts and science would be rare options.\n9.

The pact is a \"strong agreement or promise that someone makes with someone else\", according to Dictionary.com.\n2. Remembering a pact is associated with not breaking it by not fulfilling promised actions and/or to the point where it is forgotten.\n3. Remembering a pledge is associated with it becoming a habitual action and remaining in memory due to being done often.\n4. Remembering a contract is associated with being required to do something by it, often including payments and terms.\n5. Remembering a vow is associated with the action being associated with a larger act or belief.\n6. Among the choices, only C: \"remember \" (contract), D: \"keep\" (pledge), and E: \"adhere to\" (vow) make sense with the meaning of remembering a pact.\n7. A: \"do\" (what) does not apply to the meaning of remembering.\n8. B: \"forget\" (wash) is an action opposite to remembering and does not apply.\n9. \"Remember\" and \"forget\" cannot both be performed at the same time, so choose the most applicable in the given context that is opposite to \"made pact.\"\n10. \"Remember\" applies to contracts, because even if they are made, keeping the agreements is required and must be remembered when fulfilling it.\n11.

If he stopped eating lunch Sam would  have to what? Choices A: feel like B: cry C: workout D: feel sad E: nothing\nRationales: The question is about what would Sam has to do if he did not have the ability to take his father's lunch? \n1. Let's look at each option. Option A: 'feel like'. If he can't take his father's food, he wouldn't have to feel like he had to.\n2. Option B: feel sad. If Sam couldn't eat lunch, he would most likely feel sad or frustrated because he went hungry.\n3. Option C: to workout.  If Sam wasn't able to go to lunch with his father, he probably wouldn't want to work out.\n4. Option D: feel sad. Sam can't feel sad if he doesn't do anything, so if he didn't take his father to lunch, he wouldn't feel sad or anything, so the correct answer is Option B: feel sad\n5. Option E: nothing.

Choices:  a: himself b: a big guy c: a rich old fat man d: a dictator e: a business man\nRationales:\n1. According to the word definition, a tyrant is a political leader who rules with extreme cruelty and oppression.\n2. The other options of 'a big guy', 'a rich old fat man', and 'a dictator' all qualify as tyrants, though they can also fit other definitions, too.\n3. In terms of the choices provided for a tyrant, 'a business man' is clearly not a tyrant according to the definition provided.\n4. The other options indicate more of a physical description than a person's type or characteristics.\n5.

Choices: a: PUBG b: MOBAs c: FPS games d: MOBA games e: games\nRationales: The question is asking what type of game everyone can play. The answer may be PUBG, MOBAs, or others.\n1. First, consider the various game types. There are a many different type of games, but for the purpose of this question, the focus is likely on online multiplayer games (often referred to as 'MMO's or 'MMOG's)\n2. So, 'Mobs', 'fps' and a few other options are ruled out.\n3. Second, look at the options left: PUBG, mobas, and fps.

Choices: A: base B: root C: tip D: tooth E: surface\nRationales: Consider:\n1. Base is incorrect because the pain of a toothache isn't related to the 'base' of the tooth as it's not the tip. The base could be the gums or gumline of a tooth, but not the tip or surface.\n2. Root is incorrect because the pain isn't always felt near the root of the tooth.\n3. Tooth isn't the right answer choice, because the word tooth is defined as more than one tooth.\n4. Therefore, the question asks for what is always felt at the tip or surface of the tooth. This is where the pain is felt, as the tip or surface is the only part of the tooth that we as a population can always see or feel.\n\nAnswer: E: surface\n\nInput: There are two main ways that a person can use a book.

What's the correct way to carry food, according to research? Choices: \tA: keep everything loose \t\tB: keep everything in disposable containers \t\tC: keep some food in disposable containers and some in reusable containers \t\tD: keep everything in reusable containers \nRationales: Starting off with an in-depth analysis of all the options, we can realize that: \n(A) The first choice \u201ckeep everything loose\u201d seems out of the place at first glance. The first part describes \u201cpicnic\u201d which is a sort of \u201coutdoors\u201d or \u201copen-air\u201d activity. So it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep everything loose for the reason that loose objects can easily get lost in a picnic. Also, keeping things loose is the opposite of containers which are used to arrange food for a picnic. Therefore, \n(B) The next option \u201ckeep everything in disposable containers\u201d also feels a bit off as we usually carry reusable or glass containers for a picnic. In the case of keeping everything in reusable containers, we have to keep them in airtight bags. However, since we are doing picnicking, we need to take a lot of accessories (umbrella, sunshade and other accessories) with us. In this case, we might have a lot of accessories that need to be carried in addition to different types of food and disposable containers.

Choices: A: report B: keep quiet C: seek retribution D: warn others E: file a lawsuit\nRationales: The question asks about the action that an individual should take.\n1. The word \"investors\" implies that brokers are financial agents.\n2. The choices, \"report\", \"keep quiet,\" \"seek retribution,\" \"warn others\", and \"file a lawsuit\" can act as responses to any unpleasant experience.\n3. The \"keep quiet\" option is impractical given that all choices prior to this option suggest the opposite, which is why we can eliminate it.\n4. Similarly, to seek retribution in order to get retribution will not be enough to mitigate the pain of a bad experience.\n5. Therefore the correct choice is \"warn others\" since there's usually no harm in warning others against bad experiences.\nAnswer: 'warn others'\n\nInput: To keep your house clean, you can do what?

The least desirable option is that option that has the lowest quality in terms of cleaning and maintaining the house.\n1. Start by eliminating answer choices that are desirable.

You should take charge of what? Choices A: B: C: D: E: Self-Respect Self-Worth Ego Appreciation Self Esteem\nRationales: First, we start by determining that we should not rely on other.\n2. Next we need to focus on what is being asked of us. We are asked to take charge of something. \n3. This means that we must choose one of the options. They are self-respect, self-worth, ego, appreciation, or self esteem.\n4. Appreciation is not necessarily applicable here, as it involves feeling grateful or respectful of something. \n5. Ego here refers to \"a person's sense of personal self-worth\", and is not necessarily something that can be taken charge of.\n6. Self-respect involves \"high self-regard stemming from a positive perception of one's worth, or the respect of others, for one's own characteristics, performance, or situation. We are not specifically asked to 'take charge' of ourself-respect, but instead are told to'make us feel good' about ourselves. While self-respect is relevant to how we feel, it is not a specific action or a specific part of our selves that we can 'take charge' of, so we must exclude this option.\n7. Self-worth means having \"the value you place on your own identity, uniqueness, self-esteem, and achievement (also called self-image).

Choices:  a. a good question b. a question c. how come d. wow e. whats up\nRationales: This is one I had a bit of trouble coming up with a concrete solution for, but keep in mind that a good solution should be able to satisfy a wide variety of needs.\nSolution: A simple \"No one laughed or had fun\" can take on a wide variety of interpretations. The best method for deciphering the intent of the sentence is through inference, or inference questioning. For instance, inference questioning could be used to discover the age group of someone, the personality traits they have, their feelings about something they did or something that happened to them, et cetera. \nIn this case, inference can be used to infer the mindset the narrator or person whose feelings I want to understand is in.\nStep 1: What's up, What's goin on, and Why are you asking can all be questioning phrases used to infer someone's mood or mindset. If we can't determine the mindset of the person, it's likely that they're angry. \nStep 1.5: When someone is angry, they may be more likely to make sarcastic or rude comments like \"No one was laughing or have fun\" (or was having fun). \nStep 2.1: If someone is sarcastic in a situation, it also likely means that they're upset in some way. \nStep 4: It would also make sense that the person is angry if they were laughing themselves or having fun.\nStep 4.5: If someone is angry, they might be upset at other people.\nStep 5.1: If a neolithic was angry at the party, then it also probably means that they were alone at the party. \nStep 5.5: It would also make more sense that they were alone, if", "answer": "B: hear sounds"}

Americas. 3. Africa. 4. Asia. 5. Oceania.\nRationales: When trying to identify the part of the globe where it is more likely for someone to have more contact with their grandmother, each of the continents has a distinct and unique population demographic. For example, in North America, over 80% of the population are first-generation immigrants, as opposed to Europe, which has an average first-generation immigration rate of 5.2%. Similarly, while there are populations within regions of each continent that are closer in age, the same general rule holds: it is more likely for a North American, Latin American, or European to contact their grandparents than it is for an Asian, African, or Oceanic person. This rule is further reinforced when considering that these regions have varying access to technology: Asia is estimated to have a greater Internet/social media usage rate than North America, and this could potentially increase the distance between a person and their grandparent. Finally, the majority of people from the other continents also immigrated within the past century, possibly lessening the amount of interaction between grandparent and grandchild.\nAnswer: 5.

Option B \"thank god,\" may be suitable to one's needs, but the question doesn't make sense as an option for this scenario.\n8.

Options D \"sleep\" and E \"prepare to go\" may or may not fit the scenario, but it is not specific to a neolithic individual.\n10. We assume a neolithic scenario, so we can know that they would not be able to travel, and option D \"sleep\" alone does not adequately explain why or how the neolithic person might have done it. In addition, since they were hungry, sleep would not be an immediate solution.\n11. Therefore, the best choice is A: hunt.

'they were very young' points to a couple of things. Firstly, they were young, and secondly, they were likely in some way dependent on an adult, so their age was a limitation.\n2. The age of a child might dictate the type of activity they're doing, eg an activity in a theater would be inappropriate.

Start by identifying the quality a dancer needs in their performance. When considering the whole list, three characteristics are associated with high performance: \"smiles,\" \"attitude,\" and \"positive,\" all of which are associated with being \"good. \" The final quality is that of being \"average.\" The rest of the wording suggests that, if the person is good at being a teacher, judge, and friend, then they're lacking the quality of being \"average\" as a dancer.\n2. The remaining characteristics are to be eliminated.\n3. Beginning with \"smile,\" the given information suggests that the lack of this attribute does not affect performance. \"Smile\" is the most important aspect for a dancer to exhibit while performing.\n4. Eliminating \"smile\" reveals that the person is lacking a quality associated with being \"good\" as defined by \"good\" and \"teacher,\" which cannot be \"average.\"\n5. \"Attitude\" is irrelevant since that person is already labeled as good at being either a judge, teacher, or friend.\n6.

This feeling is often related to physical threats, but it also may apply to intellectual threats which are not the case here.\ne) Fearful: A fearful person is scared and worried about many things, including some which are imagined and so not based on any threats.

Choices: A: pulling out fruit B: stabbing fruit C: grabbing fruit D: pecking fruit E: piercing fruit\nRationales: Start by understanding the issue and the options provided. \nThe question states that a bird has a sharp beaks for tearing and a curved beak for pulling out fruit. \nThese two behaviors are not exactly in competition or opposition to each other, so the correct answer must refer to how a bird would use its short curved beak rather than a sharp, tearing beak.\n\nExamining the options.\nLooking at A: pulling fruit out. Pulling out fruit is the opposite of tearing fruit, because it's removing it rather than piercing it with a sharp, tearing, beak.\nNext, consider B: stabbing. This option refers to either a sharp beak or a curved beak, but it does not clarify the shape of the bird's beak.\nC: grabbing refers to using hands or tools, so it does not address the question. Moreover, the context is not that a bird is using its hands for any of the activities mentioned because the question specifies it uses a sharp beak and curved beak.\nD: pecking. The context of the question is that this bird pecks food from trees, so pecking could be the answer. However, there are birds that peck food and pull it out of trees at the same time. It's not clear which of their actions relates to the question so, this option isn't an accurate answer.\nFinally, examining option E: piercing. Piercing could be correct because a bird uses its sharp beaks to tear or peck at the fruit, but it could also refer to the bird using its curved beak to pull out fruit. It is not clear which of these", "answer": "D: wall"}

It seems that the rest of the choices do not lead to food in a direct manner.\n7. To thank god sounds too removed from the reality of accessing food.\n8. Similarly, in order to hunt for food, a neolithic population would need access to weapons, and this isn't clear based on the context.\n9.

It is an ideal democracy 2. It is an excellent example of what works in democracy 3. It is a great country 4. None of these are correct\nRationales: When looking at the first choice, we know that 1.) it is an ideal nation with a constitutional government formed on the basis of freedom and justice 2.) There are people who are politically and socially more advanced than those in other nations.\nIn terms of the second choice, we know it is not correct because the USA has had problems in the past with issues like racisim.\nIn terms of choice 3, We know 3. is not accurate because the USA is not a country which has not experienced any issues.

Choices:  A; PHONES B; LAMPS C: CAMERA D: SOUND SYSTEM E: RECORDER\nRationales: The speaker starts by explaining that the feature in question allows us to adjust the color temperature. \n2. Understanding the options given, 'phone' refers to a device for communication, whereas 'lamp' refers to a type of lighting fixture.\n3. 'Camera' relates to the process of digital imaging and'sound system' refers to electrical equipment designed to play or record audio.\n4. By considering the meaning of the given options, the word 'camera' is the least helpful option as that has nothing to do with light temperature. \n5. This is because the speaker refers to a feature that adjusts the color temperature of light, but a camera has no direct relation to light temperature. So, it's not appropriate.\n6. To eliminate choices that are not related to light temperature, 'phone' and 'lamp' are also chosen out.\n7. Out of the remaining options, 'lamp' and'sound system' can be eliminated because neither word describes a light-temperature feature. \n8.

Choices: \n A: a hug B: your credit card C: a new sweater D: a phone charge E: money\n Rationales: 1: The sentence says that you might find yourself needing something when you're walking, sitting, or meeting friends. Therefore, you would need this something at all times, even in a pub or alone in your house\n2. Next, examine each sentence individually to determine what might be needed.\n3. A hug is not needed when walking, sitting, or being with friends.\n4. A credit card cannot work without a phone\n5. A new sweater is useful, but not necessary at all times\n6. A phone charge is more useful when walking and sitting than being with friends\n7. Money is needed for phone calls, purchases, and payments at the pub, but not at home\n8.

Choices:  __________\nRationales: First, it is important to note that \"this famous story\" is generally a very vague term, and the story can refer to a wide range of possible stories, depending on who \"this\" is. But for simplicity's sake, let's assume that this story is a specific tale or series of events. Let's look at the story and then assess the options.\n\nWe begin with \"this famous story,\" which could be any number of stories. Next, let's focus on who is telling it. We have Bill, John, and Martha as the people who are telling the story.\nFinally, we turn to how they each are telling the story. The question \"Who has the most accurate memory for this story\" gives us some indication that all of these people are using their memories to tell the story rather than a recorded version or other source of the tale itself.\n\nIn this case, we know that each of them is telling the tale in at least some form, and \"most accurate\" means all of these details have an equal impact on whether or not the accuracy of their memories will affect each other or not.\n\nWhat does this all mean? Let's re-emphasize the point we made at the beginning of this explanation: \"this famous story\" could mean any number of things. This is important because how they are telling the story will have less direct relevance if \"this famous story\" turns out to be something very different than what we are all thinking it is. However, if Bill, John, and/or Martha has a completely accurate memory, then there's a good chance they will have more insight into what is going on with the story than anyone else would. They are the best sources for this information. If each of them has at least one inaccurate memory, however, it means that no one among them knows more than any other person who has access to the story.

Choices:  a. b. c. d. e.\nRationales: a. The ocean is a vast expanse of salt water that covers approximately 70% of the Earth's surface.\nb. Although humans have explored only a small portion of the ocean, it is known that the vast majority of it remains unexplored and largely unknown to mankind.\nc. The ocean's color is due to the reflection of sunlight, which is influenced by a variety of factors such as atmospheric conditions, water depth, and algae content.\nd. The blue color of the ocean is caused by the scattering of light by small particles in the water, which are known as phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are a type of algae that grow in enormous quantities in certain regions of the ocean and produce a blue-green pigment called chlorgraphy.\ne.

Choices A: intuition B: perception C: intuition D: perception E: instinct\nRationales: There are few rules and some ambiguities in these kinds of questions.  One thing to begin with is the understanding of \"sense.\"\n\n1. We use our senses (sight, taste, touch, etc.) to perceive the world through our senses.\n2. To \"perceive,\" a person must first have some sort of awareness or knowledge that they have something to learn at all regarding the thing being perceived.\n3. Once a perception occurs, the person is cognizant of that knowledge in relation to the perceived object. \n4. In this case, the parents of Jack are \"sensing\" Jack to understand that he is upset -- and are cognizant of the knowledge they have about his emotional state.\n5. Therefore they must be using their perception to know what he's thinking.\n6. This perception occurs through one or more forms of sensing. \n7. Intuition is a type of feeling or sensing which involves subconscious understanding from previous sensing. \n8. Instinct, on the other hand, is a subconscious sense which occurs with little or no awareness of what one might be subconsiously doing. \n9. Intuition and instinct are both types of sensing one might use to perceive something. \n10. Thus the answer is B. Perception\nAnswer", "answer": "A: sailing vessel"}

Choices: 1. be gold also 2. be pure gold also 3. not be gold, but real gold nonetheless 4. make up the difference 5. make no difference\nRationales: A 9 karat medal may be gold, but not pure gold. The 9 karat medal isn't made soley from gold either. A 24 karat medal is pure gold. A metal with 37% purity is not gold, but a metal with 9% purity is gold.\n6. Furthermore, since pure gold is more valuable and desirable than a gold-alloyed metal, 9% probably \"makes up the difference\" between a pure 9% metal and a pure metal such as, say, 18 carat gold.\n7.

The four given answer choices are: (A), (B), (C), and (E). This is important because the question is saying \"What is a feature of an ___?\" and the answer choices are given in ____.\n\nNow we need to apply this information to the task at hand. The word \"appositive\" in the sentence before this question is not followed by a question mark or other indicator that we are being asked a question. This means that the answer choice after a question mark are not applicable to the content preceding it. In this case, we can safely rule out (A) (adjective), as this does not provide us with information about what is an appositive.\n\nSo, now we are looking for the four remaining answer choices, knowing that they need to all apply to the information immediately preceding our question.\n\nFor (B) (phrase that gives more information) to work, we would need to know which phrase is giving the additional information. However, the appositive does not have a phrase right after it, which makes (B) unworkable.\n\n(C) (noun that clarifies another) might seem viable, as an appositive is typically used to clarify something with its noun.

While thoughtfulness is important for a role, it is not essential for the doctor in this case.\nC: Meticulous. A meticulous doctor is not necessarily a more skillful doctor, since the doctor's lack of skill resulted from missing details of the autopsy, not from misperception of the autopsy in any way.\nD: Attentive.

However, a fountain pen is different and uses a nib instead of a ball to write. The nib has a tip that comes in contact with the page. Then the ink flowing into the nib causes the nib to write. \nStep 1: In ball-point pens, the writing is generally smudgy and messier because you push the ball across the page, with your hand, whereas in a fountain pen you only press down on the paper with the nib tip. \nStep 5: In fountain pens, the writing is more delicate and elegant since the ink is flowing into such a small area that the nib is in contact with the page, causing it to write.\nStep 7: The answer is B: uses ink because its purpose is to use ink.\nStep 8: C: the writing is more difficult is out of the list. \nStep 9: Both choices A: it makes writing more complicated and easier", "answer": "E: might dream"}

In other words, the choice that best reflects this action is preparing to go.\nAnswer: E. prepare to go\n\nInput: You need to decide what you will do next. But you're not sure what to do, so you wait. When someone says, \"Come and play,\" how do you usually feel? Choices:  the question says the person feels A: happy B: unimpressed C: awkward D: angry E: eager\nRationales: This question is asking about a specific feeling that is most likely to change the person's wait-and-see attitude.\nTo figure it out, we can look at the answer choices, which are:\n\n* happy\n* unimpressed\n* awkward\n* angry\n* eager\n\nSo, if the person initially feels wait-and-see, and someone then invites them to play, how do they feel? The choices are happy, unimpressed, awkward, angry, and eager.\n\nThe answer is an emotional reaction and, given the context of the question of someone who's not sure what to do before someone invites to play, an emotional response that changes their attitude\n\nSince unimpressed, awkard, and angry are not emotional reactions, they are ruled out. Hence, the most likely change to a wait-and-see person's attitude is by someone inviting them to play and making them feel happy.\n\nThe answer of the question is \"happy\"\n\nAnswer: - \"happy\"\nInput: The city was full of people, and it was noisy.  The police had to make sure what? Choices: A: no one was drinking and driving B: that the people kept quiet C: there were no murders D: there were no crimes E:  they obeyed all of the laws in the city\nRationales: The only way to be sure that something is impossible or unlikely to occur during an event with a large number of people is to state that you don't want it to occur at all.  This is the best way to make that point without using negative words like don't and won't.\nAnswer: E) they obey all of the laws in an event full of people.\nInput: They had a party.

{"text": "relates to food access is C: to hunt for food.\n5. For a hungry person in a neolithic society, hunting for food is the obvious choice, so the answer is D: to hunt for an animal. \nAnswer: D: to hunt down an animal\n\nInput: When we want to express surprise/amoment, we say what? Choices: A: oh B: wow C: sorry D: yeah E: sure \nRationales: The question asks about a common way to express surprise/amomnet. The choices given all suggest options which could communicate surprise.\n1. \"Oh\" is a common expression in many languages that shows surprise, disappointment, or sympathy.\n2. \"Wow\" could also be used to express surprise. The word \"wow\" has several meanings depending on where it's used, but in this case, it seems to be expressing surprise. It can also mean 'in awe of' or that one is impressed.\n3. \"Sorry\" is used in different meanings than showing surprise, for example when someone is apologizing to another person. In this case, the surprise is not connected to an apology.\n4. \"Yeah\" can have several meanings, including 'yes', expressing agreement or consent. \"Yeah, it was a good movie\" in this would be agreeing or consenting with someone else's assessment of the movie. That's different from what the question is asking for, which is to express surprise/amongment.\n5. Finally, \"yeah, sure\" could also mean'sure', as in, I'm sure it was a good movie. This usage of 'yeah' might mean expressing agreement with someone else's judgment, but it doesn't directly show surprise as the question demands.\n6. Therefore, the best answer is A: \"Oh!\" which can be used to express surprise or agreement.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: To what does the sperm whale belong?

{"text": "would provide access to food is to 'hunt for food.'\n5. There could be other reasons for thanking god but those don't involve food. Prepare to go would mean a person leaves the situation (which is not the solution) and feeling humiliated is a common emotion but would not necessarily solve anything.\n6. Therefore, the solution is D: hunt for food. A neo-lithic person would be hungry and need to get food before any other solution can be considered.\nAnswer: D - hunt for food\n\nInput: If you found a toy in the ocean, who should you give it to? Choices: A: your child B: your sibling C: a family member D: a pet E: your grandparent\nRationales: Given that the question asks \"If you found a toy...\", one should first determine who would be in question. This is often a child since most toys are made for children and are found on the ground or in water.\n2. The next step is to determine the reason for giving the toy. There are several choices, A: your child, B: your sibling, C: a family member, D: a pet, and E: your grandparent. All these options differ in terms of who the toy should be given to.\n3. Option A, \"your child,\" means the person should give the toy to their own child, hence not \"a toy in the ocean\".\n4. Option B, \"your sibling,\" is related to the next option, but can only mean the person should give the sibling, or someone equally close, the toy. Option C, \"a family member,\" is the same.\n5. Finally, as the question asks \"If...\", Option D \"your pet,\" implies the person should give a pet, if they do find one, which suggests that the person won't be the one to find the toy due to the fact that pets are domestic/non-receptile. Hence, option D cannot be used to answer the question. Hence, this means that the options are 2: B or 3: C.\n4. Of these, option B is more fitting as it means the person should give a toy to anyone equally close, since it's not clear if the toy is meant for the child or not. It's not restricted", "answer": "B: animal shelter"}
{"text": "is logically related to food is to hunt for food. This option directly means hunting for game or another food source that will satiate the neolithic person's hunger.\n5. To thank god, feel humiliated and sleep are related to the person's well-being, whereas going simply involves leaving their location, and would not address the problem.\n6. Hence, the answer is C - hunt for food.\nAnswer: C - hunt for Food\n\nInput: A book about love is likely to be about how love what? Choices: A: works B: grows C: starts D: ends E: develops\nRationales: First, observe the answer choices and remove options that are not related to love.  \"develops\" is not really a verb that is related to the topic of love. \"Ends\" or \"starts\" can mean that love is beginning or ending, but this is not typically connected to love. \nSecond, consider the option that makes the most sense, given the words in the question. \"how love works\" or \"how love grows\" does not make sense in terms of book about love. Finally, given that the answer must be about \"how love develops\", C is the best choice.\nAnswer is C - how love develops.", "answer": "C: drugstore"}

The person would prepare to hunt for food by gathering supplies and preparing to hunt.\n8. The best option among the remaining choices is D: prepare to.\nAnswer: D hunt\n\nInput: Your dog and my cat like each other, what color was their play? Choices: \nA) Blue B) Yellow C) Orange D) Black E) Purple\nRationales: First, you can eliminate the choices that do not seem to be describing something that would likely cause a reaction.\n2. \"Blue\" and \"Black\" are a little odd because they are colors you don't normally expect to see and don't normally lead to a \"tall\" reaction.\n3. Yellow, orange, and purple probably wouldn't lead to any strong reaction.\n4. Now, we can focus on the other choices, which are all either in the \"loud\" or \"bright\" range of colors.\n5. The word \"loud\" could be referring to a type of noise. A loud bark would probably be similar to a \"tall\".\n6. Alternatively, a loud \"meow\" from a cat could also be similar to a \"large\".\n7. Therefore, the correct choice is a bright color, like yellow or orange.\nAnswer: B) Yellow\n\nInput: He was going to be a ______ for Halloween.

{"text": "clearly implies access to food would be hunting for it, as sleep, thank god, and feel humiliated all directly relate to how the person feels, not what they specifically do.\n5. When evaluating the remaining options, only \"prepare to go\" also implies that the person has food to eat and is able to go out on the hunt.

A: terribly B: well C: terribly D: excellently 2.  E: miserably \nRationales: The entire question is focused on the event planning, which was \"small.\"  So, first, look at the answer choices to understand what was not planned as thoroughly and correctly as it should have been. The answer choice of \"well\" does not align with the general context or wording. The word doesn't necessarily suggest poor planning as much as adequate planning.\n  So, the correct answer choice is \"miserably\" because it directly references underwhelming and insufficient planning, which aligns with the general context.\nAnswer: E. miserably\n  Answer: E. Miserably\n\nInput: The person's phone was in the front pocket of their pants. Which pocket did they put the phone in? Choices: 2.  A: the left B: the right C: the other \nRationales 1.  Look at the structure of the sentence - they put the phone in the front pocket. This implies that \"the left\" choice (A) cannot be correct as the phone cannot be somewhere on the person's left side in the front pocket.\n2. When looking at choices B and C, the word \"the\" is used before them, which implies that they would be referring to the left and right side of the person's body. The other choice (\"other\") was not on the person's body and thus does not make sense.\n3.

Choices: A: to serve, B: to please, C: to understand, D: to be remembered, E: to help\nRationales: The question, which begins with 'A good politician always has a strong desire for what?' is based on the assumption that 'a good politician always has a desire to fulfill his job/function as a politician very well'.\n1. There are 5 choices for the correct answer: 'to serve', 'to please', 'to understand', 'to be remembered', 'to help'.\n2. Each of these options can be understood in 2 possible ways: (A) in the sense of his job as a politician, that is, if he is a politician, he will serve, please, understand, be remembered, or help. In this sense, the answer choices are to serve, to please, to help, to be remembered, and to understand.\n3. Alternatively, these phrases can be understood in a general manner, that is, if someone always has strong desires like to serve, to please etc.\n4. In this sense, for a politician, these things would be a part of doing good politics, that is, fulfilling his role as a politician. In this sense, all of the answer choices are correct and appropriate.\n5.

Choices: A: strolling B: the wind C: the night D: sunsets E: autumn\nRationales: Start by considering each of the provided choices individually.\nOption A: Strolling. Strolling is a common activity which is often done outside in parks. In this case, the strolls themselves could be considered enjoyable.\nOption B: Wind. Wind blows in many different ways and is especially prevalent in warm locations. It may be refreshing or relaxing but is not directly related to setting sun.\nOption C: Night. The night typically has a very different kind of feel compared to the day, whether it be more somber or mysterious. It is not something people are interested in strolling in.\nOption D: Sunset. A sunset is not typically something someone would walk for an extended period of time, as it normally only takes up a few minutes.\nOption E: Autumn. Autumn generally refers to fall seasonal weather but does not describe a specific quality.\n\nNext, begin to analyze the context of the question by understanding the purpose and type of the question. What are the author's asking for? What action or information is being requested?\nIn this instance, the author expects an answer that would be most likely for people to answer in a conversation. Therefore, the author wants the answer to be related to something which is commonly known, such as common activities or locations.\nBased on that information, we can narrow our choices down to: \nOption A: Stroll in the park. This is a commonly known activity (in some parts of the world). \nOption B: Sunsets. Sunsets can be beautiful, but that does not necessarily mean that people stroll through parks to watch sunsets. \nOption C: Wind. Wind can be experienced in any environment and is not something particularly related to parks or nature. \nOption D: Autumn. Autmn is not a common activity or location and the sunset could potentially cause more of a feeling of darkness rather than relaxation (darkness is common for autumn, and not sunsets).", "answer": "C: butterflies"}
{"text": "directly provides access to food is C: 'prepare to go - to a place the person assumed had food.'\n5. To hunt for food or feel humiliated would not provide immediate relief, as those would only bring someone close to starvation.\n6. Similarly, to sleep or 'thank god' would also only bring the hungry person closer to death - even in cases where they are asleep or believe their god will provide.\n7. Therefore the answer is C: 'prepare' - specifically to go to a 'place the person assumed had food' - as only this option would get the person access to a resource required to survive.\nAnswer: C:\\ prepare to go\n\nInput: Tracy always has to talk about her accomplishments, her life lacks what? Choices:A: boredom B: passion C: humility D: excitement E: interest\nRationales:1. Consider the facts: 'Tracy always has to talk' refers to a habit.\n2. From the habit, we deduce a negative adjective to describe Tracy's life: 'lacks excitement.'\n3. 'passion,' 'humility,' and 'interest' are traits, which means having them in a relationship with 'excitement' makes no sense and would be a bit out of place.\n4. 'boredom' and 'lacks boredom' go against the whole scenario: Tracy always has something to talk about and never lacks the sense of excitement.\n5. 'excitement' fits in as the missing desirable trait in the scenario, and it is the one out of the choices that Tracy is trying to have in her life.\nAnswer: A (b): passion\n\nInput: A clown at the circus has the hardest time doing what? Choices: A. performing B. talking C. laughing D. singing E. showing emotions\nRationales: Steps 1,2: The question gives two clues to point us in the right direction:\n- a clown is at the circus performing, so the question must be asking what the hardest part of that performance is;\n- the options given have something to do with 'performing' in a similar way as the question, so they are likely to be accurate.\nStep 3: When we narrow down the options further by noting that c", "answer": "B: fall asleep"}

Choices: 1. A: It transports cargo from one place to another. 2. B: It transports people from one place to another 3. C: It assists with the distribution of products to consumers. 4. D: It helps in the shipment of raw materials that are used in the production of goods. 5. E: It helps in the collection of empty goods and resources that are not being used anymore.\nRationales:\n1. When considering why a shipping company is important, we are looking for a reason to support their usefulness, relevance, or value.\n2. Next we look at each of the answer options, considering the context as well.\n3. Looking at option 1, a shipping company is defined as a company that transports cargo from one point to another.\n4. The cargo being transported could be any physical things that are valuable, but this answer does not provide any other relevance or usefulness that may make them important.\n5. Considering the other options, we see that the remaining options all provide some type of support to manufacturing activities.\n6. Option 4, helps in the shipment or distribution of raw materials that are not being used to produce goods. Similarly, option 5 helps in the collection or reuse of goods and resources that are no longer needed.\n7. Option B states that a shipping company transports people from one point to another, but does not seem to be directly tied to manufacturing in any way.\n8. Option 2 states that a shipping service provides people with transportation from one point to another but this is not related to the collection of resources or supplies that are not being used in production. Also, this answer choice is not as relevant to the task.\n9. Finally, looking more closely at option D, it states that a shipping business helps in shipping raw materials that are used to produce goods. This fits with the instructions which indicate that any manufacturing supplies or resources will be supplied by this shipping company.\n10. There's also the inclusion of \"", "answer": "E: anger"}

Choices: A: brain B: lungs C: muscles D: skin E: environment\nRationales: In this question, the first thing to understand is that the word 'dizzy' refers to a feeling of being lightheaded and disoriented. \nThese symptoms are often caused by a lack of fresh air or poor circulation of oxygen in the body. \nNext, look at the choices offered: lungs, brain, muscles, skin, environment. \nThe answers that may make sense here are the 'brain' and the 'lungs', as they are connected to the body. \nHowever, neither of these accurately describes the sensation of dizziness.\nFinally, we must evaluate the most obvious answer, which is environment. \nHere, the environment refers to the whole surrounding environment of the dizzy person - not just the air quality but also the lighting and how they feel, for example.\nTherefore, the answer is B: lungs. The person's perception of dizziness is directly connected to their senses and respiration. Hence, the lungs are the correct answer.\nAnswer: B: lungs\n\nInput: Is it important that a new employee knows the proper use of equipment so that they can avoid future problems once they are on the job?

Choices: A: rainy days will never strike you B: you might need it C: you will have saved up something D: you can pay off debts E: your debts might not be paid off\nRationales: First step: The question is essentially about the importance of saving up, in the case of rain. So, the choices should reflect saving up money in the case of a \"rain\" day. \nStep 1: Second step: The option stating that a rainy day might not strike you could be misinterpreted to mean that rainy days would not strike you. But the rainy-day scenario is simply an analogy for an unexpected future occurrence. \nStep 4: In order to eliminate options that are inaccurate and not relevant, a choice that could correctly describe an unexpected future occurrence would be more likely than an option that stated that a rainy day would never strike you.\nStep 3: Therefore, the answer would be E: your debts may not be paid off. \nStep 5: If your debts are not paid off, you might need to rely on saving up money as well. So, a choice indicating the importance of saving money for future use would also be a valid option here, since this is the reason why we would save up money. \nStep 6: A choice that indicates why we should save up money could be misinterpreters as stating why we should save up. \nStep 7: So, the answer is E with the rationale \"Your debts might not be payed off.\"\nStep 8: As a result, it would also be an accurate answer to choose B because B states that \"you may need it\" and this can be a valid choice because saving up money is an effective solution to the issue of not having enough money.\nStep 9: Similarly, a choice indicating why we should save up could be misinterpreter as stating why we", "answer": "E: printer"}

Choices: 1: 160 eggs 2: 200 eggs 3: 210 eggs 4: 230 eggs 5: 240 eggs\nRationales: Since the question explicitly says there are 20 EGGS in our basket, the correct answer needs to include eggs. This eliminates the possibility that the basket contains something else altogether, such as potatoes, bread, toast, toys, pineapples, or any other food item. The basket we're talking about contains 20 eggs, full stop.\nOption (3) contains 210 eggs, which also includes other food items (such as potatoes, bread and toast).

Choices: A: health insurance B: access to education C: a better computer D: a good wage E: a savings account\nRationales: The question asks which answer would help a woman be happier, so it refers to a general issue of life, not a specific one.\n1. If she had a job, she would likely be able to provide for herself, so that is a general benefit.\n2. This benefit will then lead to her being happier, as all other answers are aspects tied to employment.\n3.

Option A - thank god - is similarly uninformative, even if it is a solution that could address the context of having been hungry, being thankful to god does not mean the person will be relieved of hunger.\n7. Option D - sleep - is also out because it does not specifically offer a solution for obtaining food.\n8. Option E - prepare to go - may suggest going somewhere for finding food, but that is not necessarily a solution towards relieving hunger.\n9.

E: Because he smokes a lot\nRationales: The question refers to a man who is very kind to his girlfriend, but she can never feel alone with him.\nThe reason for this is not explicitly given.\nThe man could have a condition that prevents him from having an intimate relationship, such as his limbs being broken or a defect in his body such as not having an eye or a nose.\nHe could lack knowledge in certain areas or have specific interests instead that would not be common or popular among most of people he would meet in society.\nThe man could be in the possession of some kind of drug, such as a strong tobacco product, that would make his girlfriend feel uncomfortable around him.\nThe man could also have a disorder that affects social interactions, such as Asperger's Syndrome, or have a general lack of confidence and be unable to form social connections.\nThe man's appearance, such as his height, weight, eyes, teeth, etc, could affect his girlfriend's comfort around him.\nOnly one answer is correct.", "answer": "B: talent"}

Choices: \nA: global climate change B: economic decline C: loss of arable land D: population growth E: loss of forests\nRationales: We want a cause of the rapid decline.  The cause may include environmental, economic, or social issues.\n\n### Choices: A: global climate change, B: economic decline, C: loss of a rural land, D: population growth, E: loss of forested areas\n\nStep 1: Eliminate choices that aren't correct cause.  Choices A: global climate change B & C: loss of forested lands are not correct because they aren't a direct cause of rapid decline. The other two choices - population growth and economic decline fit with the facts of the question, so move on to the next step.\n\nStep 2: Look at how each answer works with the facts. \nPopulation growth: Population growth is a large factor in the world population, but it doesn't directly cause rapid declines everywhere.  There are many other issues at play.\nAlso, consider how this choice can be used to further the question in an incorrect way:\n\nPopulation growth is a major cause, but global climate change is also a large factor in worldwide rapid decline, so we can eliminate population growth.  The question is asking for a direct cause, not a major cause or an indirect factor. \n\nEconomic decline: Many regions of the world have experienced economic declines in recent years, including global economic impacts like the recession of 2020.  Economic decline is not directly causing rapid declines because there are many other issues that exist worldwide as well. \n\nThis means we want an answer that's more specific to the regions that have experienced the rapid decline.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each answer\nChoice D: population growth: This is the only option that is focused on populations.", "answer": "D: shelf"}

Similarly, happiness in itself does not cause anyone to be better, to love themselves more, or to be more alive. \n3. However, a more desirable or important part of life is living. So option D, being 'a living being', could well give a successful runner a positive outlook on their lives, make them happier, and cause them to be 'famous.'\n4.

Choices:  None of the choices listed reflect this Answer:  C: God\nRationales: Start by looking at the options. The choices are that they believed that a wall would protect them from harm or that they believed someone watching over them would protect them from harm.\nBecause these options involve a belief that someone would protect them, rather than their belief in something magical, god-like, or supernatural, we can discard choice A: a wall.\nThis leaves us only with choice C: God.\nGod is a supernatural being with magical powers who protects people from harm, which is precisely what the Israelites in the old testament believed would protect them.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\nAnswer: C. God\n\nInput: If you have a sore throat and take the antibiotic amoxicillin, what would be expected as a result? Choices:  C: feeling iller D: not feeling well E: improved throat\nRationales:\nThis question is assessing your ability to recognize scientific vocabulary, specifically describing symptoms, treatments, and effects.\nThe best way to go about answering this question is to break it down and re-compose each part into your own words before choosing the best answer.\nStart by figuring out which action is most likely to be expected from antibiotics in general, such as amoxicillin.\nThis likely action would be improvement of a current state or symptom, which is what you want to look for in the answer choices.\nMoving on to the action of taking antibiotics, what does improvement of a symptom often mean?\nIt means that the body feels something, typically of illness or displeasure, to be lessened or gone, so any answer that says feeling \u201cillier\u201d would be wrong because it does not reflect improvement but rather an increase in illness.\nNow, what else could you expect to feel when you take amoxicillin?", "answer": "C: house"}

The pronoun \"who\" as the subject in the sentence refers to the professor. Hence, there is no possibility of option A: \"he\" being the correct answer.\n2. Option A: \"which\" is the first sentence; however, it cannot be used as the second sentence due to the change in verb (went). As \"which\" is a restrictive clause, the verb cannot change.\n3. As the sentence does not mention how well-prepared the professor is, neither option A nor B is correct.\n4. Option C cannot be correct as the sentence states he pointed out my mistakes. Hence, the professor cannot give me the same answers.\n5. Option D cannot be the correct option as the sentence states I was told that my grades were poor. If my professor said \"my grades are poor\" it would imply he was telling me that my grades are unsuccessful and not good, rather than poor.\n6. The correct option is E: \"grade\". As the subject of the sentences is me, it is incorrect to use \"score\".\n7. The correct option is F: \"improved\" as the professor told me that my grades were improving and not \"improper\".\nAnswer: 1: who 2: which 3: which 4: which 5: which 6: grade 7: improved\n\nInput: It was a __1__ time.

Choices: \nA: Yes B: Yes No C: No D: Yes No E: Yes Maybe\nRationales:\n1. The question asks whether a man who's never seen France, but who thinks he should play in Paris, must be a famous player.\n2. If the man has never been to France, he will be unfamiliar with the culture and social norms there, and may therefore make certain assumptions about them, which could potentially cause issues with his behavior and interactions.\n3. As such, he's likely to be an unlikely candidate for fame, since fame tends to require certain charisma and qualities that are incompatible with a lack of proper cultural exposure.\n4. Choices A, C, and E all provide the correct answer by either explicitly stating that the man must be famous (choices A and C) or implying it (choice E).\n5. Choice B provides a partially inappropriate answer, saying the man must not necessarily be famous, but he must be a good player.  This is, again, an answer that could apply both to a famous or non-famous player, so it shouldn't be answered incorrectly in this case.\n6. Finally choice D partially provides a correct answer as well, saying the man must either be a famous player or a good player.  As stated previously, either of these answers could be correct for an unknown man.  However, he may have only a single one of these characteristics, so it's imperative that this answer is chosen with care.\nFinal Step: Since the answer is partly false (it's not necessarily the case that the man must be a good player), the correct answer is E: Yes Maybe.\nAnswer: E\n\n```{.python.data-run=input}\n>>>\n```\n```{.python.run=input}\nprint", "answer": "C: body armor"}

Choices: \nA: travel B: sit on C: fall D: crash E: turn a corner\nRationales: In this case, a sled is designed to travel on the ground in an icy manner.  First, we must understand that \"travel\" and \"move\" are very similar, as sleds are designed to move, or travel, across the ground. Therefore, the choices are effectively narrowed to \"travel\" and  \"fall.\"\nOf these, travel must be correct as this describes the manner in which the sled must be moving, which is along a surface such as the icy ground. The sled, therefore, is designed to travel.\nAnswer: A Travel\n\nInput: Where would you find a hound dog? Choices: 1. Around dogs\n2. In a forest\n3. In an alley\n4. At a show\n5. In a hound dog\nRationales: First, understand the context of the question. The question asks, 'Where would you find a hounds dog?'\nThe phrase  'hound dog' must refer to a single type of dog. Based on this, there is potential for the existence of a species called a 'hounds dog'. This does not appear to be the case, and so we must determine the definition of the term 'hound dog' within the context of the question and given set of choices.\nWe see in the question that the answer to this is a 'hound dog' meaning we can eliminate options 1,2, and 5.\nA forest does not necessarily imply the existence of dogs. Also, dogs and forests appear to be separate entities, therefore we might find hound dogs in a forest. This also is not a necessary answer, and is ruled out based on eliminations.\nFinally, we are left with 1 and 3.\nThis leads us to believe we must find a hound dog in an alley and not at a show, as this is not the context of the question as the question pertains to 'where' a dog is, and not the location that a", "answer": "C: repair shop"}

Choices:  Animal Category A: bird C: cat B: lion D: turtle\nRationales:\n1. The title of the question refers to animals, specifically turtles, lions and cats.\n2. The choices specify the different animal categories as given in the title.\n3. Given the context, a bird is most likely to spot the turtle crawling, because of their heightened sense of sight.\n4. For cats and lions, the animal category is not specified, but because they are of equal sizes and both on land (unlike cats in water), cats would be more likely to notice the turtle, rather than lions. \n5. So, the choices would go like so:\n  * Category: Bird, then Bird.\n  * Category: Cat, then Cat.\n  * Category : Lion, then Cat.\nAnd hence the answer would then go like this:\n  * Category : Bird, then Bird. So, the answer should be option A: bird.\n\nOutput: The answer is A: bird\n\nInput: We would like to take you on a tour of one of London's most intriguing underground stations, but because it doesn't open until five in the morning, we hope you've What?

G: The plant needs more soil.\nRationales: Given that we know you have what is best for a plant, it is most logical to assume that you have water. Additionally, the question states that 4 parts soil is already added, so it must mean that the 3 parts water is also already added.\n1. After this much is assumed, we are given a water to soil ratio which has not been established.\n2.

So, one should choose the option that increases heart rate to be the correct answer. \n\nLooking at the different options, the heart beat is a correct answer because blood flows through the body via the heart. \n\nBecause of this, the heart rate is most related to our blood flowing.

What was that thing? Choices:  a: to stand up and fight b: to take control of his mind c: to have courage d: to learn to stand up e: to accept his life as it is\nRationales: The question asks for a specific action that the king should have done to protect his people, even though he did not do it.\n\n1. The context of the question suggests that there was something keeping the king from doing the right thing.\n2. Some possible options that apply here include \"to take control of his mind\" and \"to learn to stand up.\"\n3. The first option suggests that the king could improve his mental condition to help him, while the second option suggests that the king would not have had to deal with any other issues if he had just learned to stand up.\n4. The answers, however, do not actually make sense.\n5. The words \"king\" and \"subject\" may seem to relate to monarchs and people under them, but this is an ineffective and nonsensical interpretation since the king is the subject, not the monarch.\n6. The next choice, \"to accept his life as it it,\" has a more relevant meaning than the first two options, but would not necessarily address the issue of protecting his people.\n7.

Choices: A: wrong B: disconnected C: damaged E: misaligned\nRationales: Start by identifying what is 'off'. That is, what is implied about what would be correct.

Being misaligned suggests that the thing in question is not correct.\nStep 3: However, \"off\" can also mean not on, broken, missing, damaged, or faulty. None of these options correctly reflect \"being not right\", so they are not suitable for this context.\nStep 4. \"Disconnected\" or \"damaged\" would still be an incorrect answer, because those options imply that the thing in question does not exist or is no longer functional.\nStep 5. \"Connected\" or \"aligned\" would also be incorrect because there is no suggested implication that the thing in question should be correct.\nStep 6.

Before leaving the house, you did a quick check of the outside.  What were you likely to find? Choices: A: trash B: toys C: cats D: mice E: debris\nRationales: Here we are looking for outdoor objects lying around, not things that could have been left inside the house for the movie-viewing experience.\n1. So, starting from the outdoor and moving inward, the only choice that would make sense here is \"cats.\" Cats are small, furry mammals that can be found outside.\n2. The other choices, like \"debris,\" \"toys,\" \"mice\" and \"trash,\" are not suitable for the context of the task, since they refer to objects inside the house.\n3. There is no choice like \"mice\" which would make sense to find outdoors.\n4.

Choices: 1: dentist 2: doctor 3: nurse 4: plumber 5: repairman\nRationales: To start, we determine that a dentist is involved, since the question mentions \"when they want to get their\" teeth fixed. Further, we know that plumbers perform work with pipes, and repairmen work with appliances, tools, or equipment. Therefore, dentists are medical professionals who specialize in dental health and work specifically on teeth, and they cannot be considered plumbers or repairmen. Doctors are medical professionals who treat a wide variety of illnesses. Thus, they would not be expected to perform repairs or plumbing services, in particular, and would be unlikely to be considered as such plumber or repairman options. In this same vein, no reference is made to nurses specifically in this context. Therefore, we eliminate option 3. Option 1, the dentist, is the likely answer.\n\nInput: It is raining, how will someone get around? Choices: 2: Bicycle 5: Sailboat 3: Foot 4: Moped 6: Auto\nRationales:\n1.

Option 2 has to involve water, because of the word \"sailboat.\"\n3. Option 3 can only be a foot, because one cannot walk through water. If option 3 could be a foot, option 2 would also be a foot.\n4. We are likely to associate a \"moped\" with the road, so option 4 is likely a moped.\n5. Option 6, \"auto,\" must involve the road, rather than water.\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Yellow is actually green-yellow, and green is a primary color, so white or blue would be the answer if the question really asked for a color with more wavelengths to be more complex, the choices would be different.\n3. Since it doesn't, white would have more wavelengths and therefore be the right answer.\n4. Orange, red, pink, and blue are all colors that don't have any wavelength or white or yellow wavelengths.\n\nAnswer: B: white\n\nInput: What did Lilly bring to her dinner party? Choices:  a B C D E F\nRationales:1. There was a mistake in the statement; the sentence should say: She wanted to impress her guest and make sure everything was correct.\n2. The question is asking what she might have brought to the dinner party. \n3. She may have prepared the dinner herself, but that doesn't mean she has to have brought more than dinner. In fact, the opposite may be true.\n4. It could mean she has a lot left in the fridge to cook with. That does involve more than one dish! So, there are dishes left.\n5. It could mean she bought everything for the guest/s. But there are limitations to that. She would have to bring both ingredients and supplies or even groceries. All of those things don't constitute food.\n6. So... The correct answer is E - everything. That's the only one that's true for each answer.\nAnswer: E - everything\n\nInput: Which fruit is sweet?

What is not one of the most important of all? Choices A: 1. dressing B: 2. food C: 3. history D: 4. body language E: 5. dance\nRationales:1. The key phrasing from the question is 'different cultures that affect their behaviour and personality.' This phrasing sets up the rest of the question as the options are all things that affect behavior (and personality.)\n2. Consider all options: 'dressing', 'food', 'history', 'body language', 'dance.' Of these, each describes something that is relevant to cultural differences, but only 'dance' is listed out of order. In 'dance' the 'order' is also changed - it begins with 'dance' instead of saying that 'dance' is the beginning.\n3. If one removes 'dance', the list reads as 'dressing','food', 'history','body language.' This sequence is logical, orderly and meaningful.\n4. So the answer is 'dance' as it doesn't belong in the sequence. Answer: C: 'dance'\n\n\nInput: The first book a lot of Americans read was 'Little House On The Prairie', and what happened next?

V and VI E: I, III, IV, V, VI and VII F: I, II, VI, VII, VIII\nRationales: The question is asking why a caged chicken will die. The answers are in sequential order of decreasing likelihood.\nOption A: Because it is over-crowded. This option is unlikely because there is little to no evidence to support this possibility. Furthermore, for a caged chicken to be over-crowded, there would need to be multiple reasons that multiple cages were filled to full capacity.\nOption B: Because it's unhappy. The statement implies that the chicken is already unhappy. This is not a sufficient reason for the chicken to die, as other options may be better explanations.\nOption C: Because its wing feather dry. This would make it harder for the chicken to fly and survive, but it's unlikely to cause instant death.\nOption D: Because it's confused at night. The question states that the chicken dies, which seems to indicate that the state of being confused does not directly cause death.\nOption E: Because it has no place in which to make a nest.

From these features, we know that step 1) to find the topic sentence; step 2) to make a summary of the paragraph; step 3) to think of the answer to the question asked are all incorrect and irrelevant.\n3. As for the question of 4) \"to find a specific detail to identify a main topic of the paragraph\", it also needs to be discarded because the main focus of the paragraph is on identifying the main topic or idea.\n4.

Choices: 1. A: It uses gas as an input and then spits it out right into the cylinder 2. B: It turns the gas into vapor 3.C: It takes the gas and mixes it with the air 4. D: It makes more gas\nRationales: The task is to select the option that describes best how a carburetor works.\n1. Option A can't be correct,  it implies the carburetor spits out gas.\n2. Option B seems contradictory, it's impossible to turn gas into vapor unless it's an explosion or a miracle\n3. Option C makes sense and accurately describes a carburetor's functionality\n4. Option D doesn't even need carburetor as it makes more gas\n5.

Choices: \tA: long B: large C: wide D: triangular E: narrow\nRationales: Start by understanding what a sphinx is, which is a mythical creature that is generally associated with great power and wisdom. Next, evaluate the available choices to determine which one is least true. In this case, choice B is incorrect because it refers to the entire body of the creature, not just its head. Likewise, choices A and C are incorrect because neither of these choices describes the head of the sphinx correctly. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn't describe the head or part of the creature at all. So, if we take away choices B, A, C, and D, we are left with two plausible answers - E: narrow, and E: wide.\nAnswer: E; Wide\n\nInput: The woman was at the fair. The clown came out of the door and what? Choices: A: she walked forward B: no one knows C: she clapped D: she left E: she ran off\nRationales: The question refers to a clown coming out of a door. So, we need to understand the context of this action: the clown came out the door, and then what? Choice A is incorrect because it indicates that the woman walked forward. The clown's action does not relate to the woman moving. Choice B is incorrect because no one knows what happened, not even the narrator. Choice C is incorrect because the woman did not clap. Choice D is also incorrect because she did not leave. So, it remains to be chosen A: She walked forward.\nAnswer: A; She walked forward\n\nInput:  My brother got a promotion at work.

Choices: 1. A: often used B: often found C: found on everything D: found mostly\nRationales: The question asks which one of the provided choices is the most common.\n2. The only thing that would differentiate the answers is how often they are found.\n3. Choice A \"often used\" means that it is used quite often, but it does not say whether the color white is the most common choice of color to use.\n4. Choice B \"often found\" means that it is often found, and this may suggest that this color is more commonly found than all the other colors. However, this does not say that it is the most commonly used or found.\n5. Choices C \"found on everything\" and D \"found mostly\" do not provide any information in regards to the question, as they simply indicate that this color is found more than others. \n6.

So, John and his son ate food.\n1. What kind of food they ate is a detail the reader wants.\n2. The choices are food they made, food they gathered, food they bought, food they saved, the question already states that they ate food.\n3. What makes sense with what is already stated is they ate food they had taken.\n4. Food they had taken makes the most sense because they took food when travelling.\n5. Answer choice B is not a suitable answer because they gathered food only not purchased food and their journey took place in the village where their family lived.\n6. Choice A is not the right answer because they brought food while travelling but after returning they ate the food they took to eat during the journey.\n7.

Choices:  No, a good thing No, a bad thjng Yes, a good thing Yes, a bad thing No, a neutral thing Yes, a neutral thing\nRationales: Start by understanding the choice between good and bad.\n- 'Good' generally refers to qualities related to morality or ethics.\n- 'Bad' refers, typically, to qualities related to a negative or opposite nature.\n- 'Neutral' can refer to something neither morally good nor bad.\nNext, evaluate each choice for the question:\n- First, let's look at option A No, a good thing. This choice directly states it's not a good thing, therefore it is an incorrect option.\n- Next, we have option B No, a bad thing. 'No' and 'bad' cannot logically fit together. 'No' is an answer which implies there is a good thing in the question. Therefore, B does not make sense.\n- Let's move on to A Yes, a good thing. Option A Yes, a good ting would be the correct choice because it states yes, this was good, which is correct because goats give birth when they come in heat, not when conjured by a magician.\n- Option C Yes, a bad thing is out of the question for the same reason.\n- Now, let's look to the other choices, starting with D No, a neutral thing. Neutral, by definition, means it does not have a good or a bad value. Therefore, option D can be ruled out as incorrect.\n- Next, let's look a E No, a neutral thing, since B and C have already been ruled out.

This means the listener should help the speaker improve so that the speaker can improve through understanding.\n1. We read through the questions and decide that Asking Questions can also help the speaker improve as a speaker.\n2.

Choices:   A: happy B: annoyed C: mad D: sad E: disgruntled\nRationales: Start by understanding a bit about the options. Here, \"weather\" refers to atmospheric conditions, particularly temperature, humidity, and precipitation.\n\n1. Happy is an emotion and typically a positive one. So, when the person was thinking about the weather, it was likely a positive experience.\n\n2. Annoyed and mad have negative connotations and likely refer to when it was not a good experience. \n\n3. Sad is an emotion related to feelings of sadness or grief. But it doesn't seem to fit the context of weather.\n\n4. A bit of dictionary research indicates that disgruntled is used to refer to someone who feels unhappy about how things are. Since feeling unhappy about the weather seems odd, that won't be it.\n\n5. Only option E: disgruntle fits. Therefore, the answer will be E: disgruntles. \n\nAnswer: E: disgruntlings\n\nInput: Somebody was taking too many photos, so what did they do?

Hence, the answer is C Hunt for food. The person was hungry and needed food; hunting provides them with a solution.\nAnswer: C Hunt for food\n\n### Instructions:Complete the passage below, making each of the changes where necessary. Choose the response in which the sentence is complete and contains no errors. \nHundreds of years ago, the ancient Greeks had many gods.  In that day of faith, even a boy who could not walk was considered a god of some kind, because it was thought the gods would save him from disease and bring him healing.  It was all part of their beliefs, which they held in faith, like a blind man with a crutch.  In those days, a man's eyesight was considered the truest sense of all, and to be blinded by any other sight was a terrible insult.  No, in those days a blind man would never use his sight to walk because sight was too important.\n\nRationales:\nStep 1: Start by identifying that the issue is the passage being in need of a correction or adjustment.\nStep 2: Look at the options given in the options.\nStep 3: Start by reading the 1st sentence of the passage, 'Hundreds of yearsago, the ancient Greeks hhad many gods'. Notice that there are 2 errors in this sentence. First, it is missing a subject. Also, an extra 'had' is used in this sentence, making the second error.\nStep 4. Now focus on the correction given in choices. The author of the passage has left out the subject: 'The'. Hence, in order to rectify the error, 'The' should be added at the beginning of the sentence after 'Hundreds'. \nStep 5: Similarly, the second error: 'had' needs to be reduced to 'have' in order to bring it in line with the sentence and the context.\nStep 6.

Choices:\nA: found B: discovered C: uncovered D: exposed E: unveiled F: unearthed\nRationales: Start by reading the question, which says 'a bone was what'. This question seems to be asking about a particular bone as a whole, not just the discovery or uncovering of the bone. \n1. As a result, look at the other options to see what would accurately describe the bone and its discovery together.\n2. Looking at the other options A: found and B: discovered,  these would describe the process of discovering or finding the bone - however, the question asks specifically about the bone and the act of discovery in the same sentence.\n3. The other options C: uncovered, D: exposed, and F: unearth -  these all refer specifically to the bone as well; when bones are uncovered, exposed, or unearthed it is likely because of a discovery process.\n4. As a result, looking at the available options, the only option that describes the bone and the process of discovery in the same place is E: unveiled.\n5. Therefore the answer is E: unveil.\nAnswer: E:- unveil\n\nInput: A man had to write to his friend across a mountainous range, which form of message transmittion took too long?

Choices: A: boredom B: depressed C: annoyed D: boredom E: depression\nRationales: The question is asking for an emotion that people from different nationalities experience. \nStep 1: Start by understanding the meaning of 'bore.' 'Boredom' is an emotion felt when one feels their environment lacks sufficient interest to stimulate their interest.\nStep 2: Look at the other options of 'Depressed, Annoyed, Depression' and 'Boredom.' These options can all apply to different nationalities.\nStep 3: However, 'Annoyed' and 'Depression' are not as likely to occur in a general sense among people with different nationalities.\n\nStep 4: 'Depression' is more closely associated with people of a certain nationality, which leads one to believe it should not be included in a general list of emotions that apply equally to different nationalities. \nStep 5: 'Annoyed' is an emotion which could be felt by people of different nationalities, but it is more likely to occur as a result of a specific incident or experience instead of being a general state of mind.\nStep 6. Therefore, the correct answer is to assume 'Boredom' applies to people of different nationalities.  So the answer is B: boredom.\nStep 7.

{"text": "actually provides a means to alleviate hungerm is D: to feel hungry.\n5. Similarly, the other choices are all options that provide means to distract oneself from hunger: they don't actually aid the person who is hungry in some significant way.\n6. This is because it's possible to thank god in the absence of food. This doesn't necessarily mean the god will provide the needed food. Likewise, it's possible to hunt for food in the absence of food -- that is, if you are hungry, you don't necessarily have food in your hands. Likewise, feeling humiliated is not directly correlated with having food. Going to bed and preparing to go are potential ways to alleviate hungers, but they are ineffective since you cannot truly sleep when you're hungry, and you cannot go places or perform tasks if you are hungry.\n7. Therefore in conclusion, the only valid option is D: to prepare to go.\nAnswer: D2: prepare to go\n\nInput: A woman is trying to describe the character in a short story she's reading.

Choices:  a: by huddling up together b: they fly towards a warmer location c: they roost d: they fly away to bed e: they fly together in a group\nRationales: Start by evaluating the question, \"How do birds handle it?\" which should prompt the answer be in line with \"bird's behavior\", not a generalization about the animal kingdom since 'handle' seems too generic and abstract.\n2. To narrow down the choices, first ask yourself \"How do birds sleep at night\" to make sure the answer is relevant to understanding bird behavior.\n3. Since the question asserts its darkness and cold, the answer must be relevant to those specific situations with the answer possibly including 'fly towards a warmer location', 'fly away to bed' or 'fly together in a group'.\n4. However, 'roost' can be used to describe the state of any type of bird when it goes to bed, so it is not the best match.\n5. As for the other three options, while they each could represent a bird's behavior at night, the choices given are more descriptive of certain bird's behavior throughout the day as well such as a flock of geese flying together.\n6. Looking at the last four options, 'fly to bed' and 'fly together in a flock' only apply at certain times of day, so both are excluded.\n7. Therefore the answer is still B: they fly towards a warm location. Birds' behavior includes fly away to bed, fly together in a flock, or fly towards a warmer place.\n8. This answer is also supported by the fact that it can also be a reasonable response because 'flying towards a warmer place' is a behavioral response that birds tend to exhibit", "answer": "A: pub"}

Choices:  \nA: rice  B: seaweed C: salmon D: tuna E: wasabi  \nRationales:  1. Understanding the main ingredients of sushi involves first understanding what exactly sushi is.\n2. Sushi is a Japanese food, made up of prepared fish served over cooked vinegar rice.\n3. So, the main ingredients in sushi are cooked, vinegar rice, and the type of fish.\n4. The common fish used in sushi include tuna and salmon, but sushi also incorporates less common species, including octopus and seaweed.\n5.

Choices A: fire B: air C: rock D: dust E: sunlight  \nRationales  1. The answer choice, which states that the sun is made of sunlight, is incorrect. The question, \"what is the sun made of?\", refers to the elements that make up the physical composition of the sun.  The answer choice refers to what it emits, which is not the same as what it is made of.\n2. However, when looking at the correct options, it seems clear that the sun is not made of water or rock. As for dust, while most objects contain dust, the sun cannot be made of dust. Hence the answer choice D: dust is incorrect.\n3. This leaves B: air, C: rock, and A: fire as the options remaining. Of these choices, air and rock do not seem to accurately and specifically describe the sun, while fire may seem like a potential option. \n4.

We can identify the cause of the better result from a quick assessment of the options. A and C don't seem to account for why the toothbrush will result in a more effective brushing. This rules those out.\nOption D refers to brushing with the new toothbrush won't harm old fillings. This option is not likely to be related to brushing techniques which is the reason a person brushes.\nThe issue can be narrowed to 2 options: A the bristles, or B the product.\nIf it has to do with the bristles, we would need a way to relate the choice to brushing. It should be the case that a new toothbrus will have better bristles.\nOptions 1, 2, and 4 aren't relevant in this context since they say nothing about better bristles. Option 3 says that it's easier to use so it's likely that there are other reasons to pick a new toothbrust other than effectiveness.

This means that the physician is likely to be knowledgeable in these areas.\n\nNext, let's look at the options given for where he most likely works as a physician, in what order. Hospital, school, church, museum, or home. \n\nHospital is likely to be the place where a physician works, because it is a place that treats illness and injury.\n\nSchool is likely to be the most appropriate place for the physician to work, because medicine and surgery are taught in schools.\n\nChurch is less likely to be the place the physician works, because medicine and surgical operations are generally not performed in churches.\n\nMuseum is least likely to be the appropriate place for the physicist to work, because the main activities that occur at the museum are displaying, studying, and protecting historical objects.

Choices: A: buy a new boat B: go to hawaii C: retire in bermuda D: buy what we need E: put kids through college\nRationales: For the question to make sense, it's necessary to understand how much money Americans make in comparison to other countries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of the 2018-19 financial year, the average income in the US was at $60,336 (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cew.nr0.htm). This is compared to the following countries below (https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2013/09/22/how-well-do-americans-fare-vs-other-countries?slide=110851): Finland ($34,953), Korea ($31,924), and Japan ($36,252). Thus, each of these other countries have significantly less income than the average American.\nThe choices are as follows: A: buy a boat; B: go to Hawaii; C: Retire in Bermuda; D: buy what you need; E: Put kids through college. Looking at choice A: \"buy a boat\" is not even close to being the most money you'd need in order to obtain something like buying a boat.\nChoices B, C, and D are all pretty reasonable possibilities. Retirement costs vary, but you'll see it is hard to put a solid number on what it all costs in places like Bermuda; thus, this would be hard to figure out.\nThus, we are left with choice E: \"put kids through college\". This is the most realistic choice among these choices. Putting kids through college can be done in the US at pretty cheap prices, especially considering things like student loans (https://", "answer": "A: break easily"}

Choices: A: sadness B: drama C: craziness D: stupidity E: chaos\nRationales: The question asserts two things: \"we often\" find humor and \"humor is\" associated with something.\n1. First, take notice of the key words from the question. The answer is based on the meaning of these key words, and they help break down the question into manageable parts.\n2. Next we will look for the best option from each of the provided choices.\n3. Starting with \"sadness,\" there doesn't seem to be enough evidence to show that people find humor in sadness.\n4. Drama may seem like a good option to consider, but it also wouldn't seem to fit the description \"often find.\"\n5. Now, let us consider chaos more closely. It is a possibility, but the question seems to imply that chaos wouldn't actually be something that is being \"often found\" to be funny.\n6. Stupidity and craziness seem to be the best options from the provided choices.\n7. Stupidity seems to be associated with finding humor as a word, but the word itself doesn't necessarily mean that the things or people finding humor are stupid.\n8. Crazy is also used throughout that describes humor. However, just like the description of chaos could be applied to the word craziness, it could be applied to the question.\n9. Now, it is time to consider the full context of the question, what \"humor\" means, and the two statements presented. In the context of \"often find\" and \"humor\" being associated with stupidity and craziness, it seems the most likely answer.\n10.

Choices:   2: Hexagon 3: Octagon 4: Diamond 5: Parallelogram\nRationales: Start by understanding that the question is asking for a specific type of square.\n2. A square could refer to a mathematical object. Since a square is a particular type of rectangle, a rectangle that looks like an octagon would not be considered a square.\n3. A square could also refer to a structural object. In this case, a square cannot be a rectangle that looks like a hexagon, as two parallel lines cannot make a square.\n4. A square has to be made up of four sides, but a rectangle could not have exactly four sides. 5. A square has to have equal sides, and a parallelogram can have a different number of sides.\n6. Therefore, The square has to be a diamond or a quadrilateral, so the 3 options are Hexagon, Octagon, Diamond, and Parallelogram.\n7. Hexagons have 6 sides. Therefore, the Hexagon choice would not be an option as squares must only have 4 sides.\n8. The Octagon choice is also eliminated by the rule that an octagon cannot have 4 sides. A square therefore cannot look like an octagon, so it cannot be a rectangle that resembles an octagon.\n9. We can then cross out the Octagon as an option.\n10. The Diamond remains as the only choice, as squares must have 4 sides that are congruent.\n11. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'a quadrilateral', specifically, 'the diamond'.\nAnswer: diamond\n\nInput: An african swallowtail butterfly feeds on what?

Blizzards involve snow, which can possibly be accompanied by hail or rain.\nStep 2: Looking at a possible solution: a'storm' can be identified with blizzards, hail, and rain, which describes the answer.\nStep 3: Therefore, the answer is D: storm.\nAnswer: D; storm\n\nInput: She had forgotten the time and how many chocolates she ate.

The question in the above question is \"What is the most likely thing that will happen to a lemon?\".\nStep 2: Eliminate options which are unnecessary. The question is asking what is the best answer or most likely answer, so options like \"A Break\" and \"B crack\" are incorrect.\nStep 3: Analyze and eliminate optional answers.

Choices: A: cream B: melted ice C: liquid D: solid E: water\nRationales: The question asserts what'melted' ice cream cone and ice water would both melt into.\nStep 1: Based on the question, we understand that they would both melt into water. However, to determine what water, we need to consider which ingredient would be added to water if they were to mix ice cream and ice.\nStep 2: Looking at the ice cream ingredients, we conclude that the cream would be added to the water to create a mixture that resembles ice cream. Ice cream does not contain melted ice and therefore, cream would not be a correct choice for the final answer.\nStep 3: Consider the remaining options. The ice, when melted, will create water, so ice will not be correct. We can eliminate'melted ice' as an option.\nStep 4. Similarly, 'ice water' can be eliminated because it is in fact the melted ice that would have transformed into regular water through absorbing the water and heat of the melted ice cream.\nStep 5. Then, considering the context of the question and the other options, there is a high chance that ice water became water and absorbed the extra ingredient.\nStep 6. We are almost there: now that we have eliminated all the options, we can determine that the water would be water and not any other ingredient given its context with the ice cream.

Option a: a stage - According to Merriam-Webster's online dictionary, a stage is a platform or level of the stage on which a play or performance is given.\n2. Option b: radio play - According to Merrian-Webster's definition of radio, it is a device that transmits radio waves to carry a signal which carries sound, and thus is a platform for a monologue to be played on.\n3. Option c: book - A book is a bound and printed volume, not necessarily containing literature, and is thus not considered to be the platform for a monolog.\n4. Option d: comedy - There are many examples of jokes and comedy skits, but a monologue is generally considered to be a single person's speech,\n5. Option e: one person talking -This option doesn't provide enough information to determine if it refers to a monologue.\n6.

It would be a wrong attempt to ignore this context of the question and think that the child's choice can be any of the given options.\nWe can ignore the first option, 1: \"obey.\"\nIn the second option, 2: \"go\", the child has to go wherever his mother wants to go.\nOption 3: \"ignore\", can't be an option to please a mother, she will not like it.\nOption 4: \"play\", should be an option for a child to please her mother.\nWe are left with the fifth option, '5 refuse', and this wastes valuable time. No child can refuse to do what her mother wants. If the child refuses, the situation would get dull, so the answer can be nothing else but 4\nAnswer: 4: Play.\n\nInput: In 100 words, write what kind of life makes you want to achieve your goals.

Being pessimistic, or less optimistic, will likely result in what? Choices: A: being more successful B: more frustrated C: unproductivity D: more peaceful E: having a better future\nRationales: Start by understanding the issue which states that a person needs to be optimistic when he wishes to have a great quality life. \n2. Look at the meaning of an \u2018optimist\u2019. An optimist is someone who expects the best in the future.\n3. Evalute the given choice: successful, frustrated, not more productive, not more peaceful, has a better future. The only thing an optimistic mind helps is to have better life in the future.\n4. We need to eliminate options A, B, D, and E respectively as they are the opposite of having a better future.\n5. The question refers to the person who does not want a better future as he does not want to try to be successful in the future. He is the one who would likely be pessimistic.\n6. The meaning of pessimistic is someone who expect the worst for the future.\n7. The meaning of optimism is someone who expects the better future.\n8.

(E) pastures means fields.\n(E) the pastures would refer to where the cow is fed, so (B) could be correct as well. (C) bull is a word that is commonly used both as a verb and as a noun, and it could be a noun in this case, as it would be where the cow is fed.\n\nConclusion: The answer to this question is most likely: (E) the pasture. (B) a boll (as a noun) does not fit based on the structure of the sentence, and would just be a mispelling of a bull.\n\nInput: She can't find the keys. They must be in her ______.

Choices: \n     A: To feel isolated and lonely. B: To be away from people. C: To be outside in the wilderness. D: To be outside all the time. E: To be with other dogs.\nRationales: We are looking for the reason why a person would want their dog to spend the summer. \n1. We can rule out A: To feel isolated. While people can feel isolated at a cabin, that isn't necessarily the point; it's about being in nature.\n2. We can also rule out B: To be away people: while the cabin may be away from people, the person wouldn't want to spend the summer away from people.\n3. C: To be outdside: That'd be nice in some respects, but the question isn't asking for what would be nicer with the dogs. \n4. Finally, we're left with D: To be outside 24/7. Since the person does want to be with other dogs, their cabin doesn't have to be outside. Moreover, since they want to be with other people, they probably don't want the cabin to be away from people.\n5, Therefore C: To be outdoors in the wilderness is the answer. \nAnswer: C: To be outside all day in the wilderness\n### Demo: \nInput: The sun's been in the sky since dawn so it will set soon.

Choice: B: a good book, is one that represents an option we can use as we continue looking.

Each match will take one minute to complete. A single game in the tournament has three elements: a game, a match, and a round. All games have two halves. Three people will sit on each team. All matches involve both teams fielding six players each. A round corresponds to three games. There are nine rounds in total. Each team gets three chances to change players. Any teammate with a red jersey can only play in games involving matches.\n\n### Output:\nThe first match is between teams two and six.

The phrase \"that they like spam and hunt\" is a sentence fragment and includes no indication about its location. Because the question starts by asking \"What's not correct\" about specific people, we need to eliminate the fragment that doesn't contain names of specific people.\n2. In that same paragraph, the correct answer is choice B: \"They have no cell phone coverage.\" Cell phone coverage does not match the description of people who \"like ham or spam.\"\n3. \"They speak a rare dialect\" doesn't match the description of people as it is about their language capabilities, not their food preferences.\n4. \"They are not very clean\" doesn't match because the question revolves around food preferences rather than personal hygiene.\n5. \"They must be living on a dessert island.\" doesn't match this type of question, because it doesn't explain what is wrong from the beginning.\n6. \"They do not like any other types of meat except ham or ham.\" This answer clearly matches the description of the person's food preference.\nInput: Danny decided to do something nice for him.

{"text": "indicates access to food is hunting.\n5. Therefore the answer is D: hunt for food, as this is the only choice which can enable a neolithic (or any) person to access food.\n6. The other choices do not allow a person to get access to food.\n7. It is not possible to thank god as the person did not exist at that time.\n8. Similarly, though the other answers may be true, one could not directly solve hunger by doing these actions.\n9. The person could ask others for food, but this is the exception to the rule as a person is assumed to hunt for food unless he was incapable of doing so, like a child or an invalid who can neither hunt nor ask or expect others to provide food.\n10. The other choice of sleep can only be useful if one is too hungry to engage in any activities like hunting and thus has to sleep.\n11. Hence, the only option that gives the person access to food and which is both consistent with facts about the ancient civilization is D: hunt.\n12. The only other options of sleep or feeling humiliated can only be useful if the person is too hungry to hunt or even eat, which does not indicate that a person is able to solve their hunger.\n13. Alternatively, feeling humiliated does not allow the person to solve their hunger and thus is not the correct solution.\n14. Similarly, feeling humiliated or even thanking god does not enable a person to eat food and thus does not directly solve their hunger. \n15. Even if a neolithic could go find someone to get food, the people of the time were not expected to share their food outside the community.\n16. Additionally, asking others would indicate weakness since other humans were not used to being asked for things and were often suspicious when strangers wanted things.\n17. Finally, asking for food would indicate weakness since the rest of the community would not usually expect others to ask for food.\n18. Therefore, the only choice in which one could access food to solve their hunger is D: hunt, which is the correct solution.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: A lot of research has been conducted into the causes of death.

{"text": "allows solving hunger is \"hunt for food\". The others are not related to food. If the person prepares to go, they remain hungry. If they sleep, they get to rest but cannot eat. The person would be too humiliated to tell about the hunger to their tribe or ask for food. Thanking god implies that there is food available, in which case thanked god would not be able to solve the problem.\n5. Therefore the answer is E: prepare to go. If the hungry person can't solve the problem, the person should try to find a way to solve the problem. Hunt for food means the person is trying in someway to find the solution to this problem. In the wording of this question, \"Thank god\" and \"Feel humiliated\" options seem to be contradictory with each other since when we are grateful to god for our food, we should have no reason to feel humiliated.\n6.

Choices: . A: They're philosophising B: they're bored C: they're not interested in life D: they're depressed E: they want deep insight\nRationales: Start by defining the questions: what does it mean when someone calls for the meaning of life, and what would they actually mean by it. \n1. The meaning of the question has a philosophical connotation, suggesting that the person looking for meaning is attempting to determine the ultimate meaning of life and why people are here in the first place.\n\n2. The person inquiring about the meaning of life might have asked the question in an attempt to gain philosophical insight. \nThe phrasing \"meaning of life\" itself could indicate that the underlying question posed is actually searching for a deeper philosophical answer, rather than being bored or tired of their own existence, not expressing interest in life, or being depressed.\n3. To determine if a person was expressing interest in the meaning of life (rather than the other options), the person might use philosophical or religious language.\n\n4. Based on the context of the question (philosophical connotation), the best answer choice is C: They're not interested in their life.\n5. Therefore the answer to the question 'what does it mean when someone says the reason of life' is the meaning of life they're after is 'interested in life'\nAnswer: A. They're philosophizing\n\nInput: In the story of Jack and the Beanstalk, what did Jack see in the castle?

Choices: A. herbivorous B. omnivorous C. carnivorous D. vegan E. fisher\nRationales: First, a general overview of the question and available choices can help us identify any potential confusion in the question itself.\nNext, we can look at the first and last of the given choices and determine in general terms any particularities of vegetarian or fisherman diets.\n\nStep 1: A herbivore is an animal that eats plants and plants alone. All humans are omnivores and thus, herbivores in this sense cannot be applied to humanity in general.\n\nStep 2: An omnivore is an animal capable of eating both meat and plants, as well as both animals and plants. Fisher does not apply to a person that eats fish in their diet, and thus is inapplicable. \n\nStep 3: An omnivorous diet is one that is composed of both meat and vegetables.\n\nStep 4: A carnivore is an organism that eats only meat.

A rut does sometimes lead to one's digging out of the rut\n\nSo, the choices that can apply in this context are: \"stop, drown, die, get help, give up\"\nSo which one do they apply to? \n\nAside from a rut, these choices could more generally be applied elsewhere (like in a rutted driveway.)\n\nThese choices can also be applied to a real person digging out of a rut.\n\nBut in the context of the question on what the person did before getting out of a rut, they are all inappropriate.\n\nSo what do we know of the choices that are in the correct context? \n\nStop and Drown both don't make sense with the scenario of a rut unless the rut was an unexpected drowning, in which they are not options, but more the result. \n\nSo that leaves 3.

Since the neolithic time period lacked modern technology, the only available options to solve the problem would have been to hunt for food, sleep, or prepare for going out to hunt food.\n6. So, the answer must be one of the first two options.\n7. Though both \"hunt for food\" and \"sleep\" appear to be plausible solutions to a hunger problem, \"hunt for food \" is a more direct and achievable solution for the neolithic person.\n8. For example, a hunt for food might not directly alleviate the hunger, but since it is considered a direct solution to the problem, the answer should be more detailed and direct in its meaning.\n9. The other option \"sleep\" is too vague and indirect to be appropriate. A neolithic person also might be lacking in sleep because of hunger, but this is not explicitly stated in the question.\n10. So, the answer should be something more specific.\n11. Finally, the question itself explicitly states that \"so what was their solution to prblem\" which helps narrow down the choice as only one option, \"hunt for mford\" provides a realistic solution to the problem.\n12.

The wording itself reveals that something that the speaker said provoked a negative reaction. It is likely that there was something in the speaker's remark that the listener found offensive or insulting. Based on that assumption, we can eliminate options B and C since they indicate that the speaker should not bother the listener. It follows that options A, D, and E each suggest a different explanation for why the listener objected to the speaker's comments.\nIn the context of the conversation, the listener is upset at the speaker's remark. Option A is inappropriate because it implies that the listener was not competent in performing the task that he was assigned. Option D is not the correct response because it would be inappropriate to tell the speaker that his comments bothered the listener. Additionally, option D indicates that the speaker gave the listener unnecessary work.

Stimulants are compounds which  can cause a variety of side-effects,  because they activate neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters in the brain are what the body uses to relay info to the rest of the body and vice-versa.  Stimulants like caffeine increase the production of neurotransmitters, particularly acetylcholine. A problem with caffeine is that it also induces a tolerance to its own effects, meaning the user has to take more of it to get the same effect.  The result can then become more dependence and addiction to caffeine.  But the actual answer to \"Are you addicted to coffee?\" is No, you can't get addicted to coffee! No, you can'T get addicted to coffee!\"  Coffee itself does not cause any sort of physiological addiction, because it is a chemical which does not actually release serotonin or dopamine, the chemicals linked to addiction.  Stimulants do however cause addiction because these chemicals do release serotonin and dopamine and the brain perceives their effects as a positive feedback loop and thus seeks them out.  Even though stimulants actually release what addicts look for, they do not release the ones that can actually get an individual hooked.  Stimulant chemicals may however become addictive,  and these are the ones that actually cause the problem. What happens is when someone is addicted to a stimulant, their brain goes into alert or survival mode.  This triggers the release of cortisol, the hormone linked to stress which is an enemy of sleep and which can be linked to numerous health issues such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, etc.  So if you want to take coffee, tea, etc.  and drink it without a problem,  make sure it's black and unsweetened.

C: writing iv. D: sleeping v. E: practicing\nRationales: i. The question says that he is going to do something.\nii. This can imply that he is going to follow his big dream and accomplish it.\niii. We know that He is a realistic, thought-provoking focused person. All of these things are probably needed in order to plan for his dream; therefore, he is probably planning.\niv. The other choices could still possibly be choices he could do in his plan. But, the more reasonable option is: planning.\nv. The next step is: which thing is he likely doing?\nvi. Among other things, he is likely to be dreaming - there are many things he is thinking about. But dreaming is not a specific, tangible thing he is doing.  It could take any of the forms he is focusing on- making a plan, writing, sleeping, or practicing. \nvii. The other choices do not really fit this scenario.\nviii.

Which is best: A: the road of the least resistance or B:  an uphill course? Choices:  C: D: E:\nRationales: Start by realizing you are working through question that has two answers you must consider.\n1. The first option is: The Road of Least Resistance. This option is referring to the most direct path to a destination.\n2. Comparatively, the second option is: an uphill course. The word \"course\" here refers to a journey or path. \n3. Evaluating the provided options, we find that an \"uphill course\" means going up hill to reach a destination.\n4. This gives us more information relative to \"road of least resistance.\" \"Road of least resistance\" could be a direct path to the destination or the fastest path to the destination.\n5. The path \"an uphill course\" seems more apt because it refers to a more challenging course of the journey to reach the destination.\n6. The next choice is \"D: the easiest one\".\n7. Here \"easiest\" means that this choice is least difficult to make to complete.\n8. The most difficult journey, and thus the option that would require least effort, would be an uphill journey. This is an appropriate complement for \"the easiest one.\"\n9.

Choices:  a. being sympathetic B. being supportive C. having the same problem D. feeling as they do E. having the same opinion\nRationales: Each phrase in the question has been carefully chosen to make sure it accurately corresponds to what it means to have the same feelings as someone.\na. Being sympathetic means having the same feelings as another person.\nb. Being supportive means helping or supporting another person in some way.\nC. Having the Same Problem means you and another person are both experiencing the same problem or similar experiences.\nD. Feeling as they do means feeling the same way as another person.\nE. Having the Same Opinion means having the same viewpoint as another person. \n\n1. However, in order to determine the correct answer, look closely at each phrase in turn.\n2.

A painting by a particular artist is definitely not what we are looking for here.\n2. A dish made from cold vegetables might well have the same name in different parts of the world, but generally speaking dishes and meals are not something commonly referred to by a name.\n3.

Therefore, in order to answer this question, one would need to understand the choices provided in terms of the neolithic age and what solutions they had to their hunger problem.\n6. Based on that understanding, the answer is B: hunt for Food.\nAnswer: B: hunt for fish\n\nInput: A fisherman made a fishing net, so what did he need a net to catch? Choices: \tA: big fish B: small fish C: other fish D: water\nRationales: In order to get fish, one must have a way to catch them- that is, a fishing net.\n1. If a person fishes with the intent to catch only smaller fish but uses a net that's made to catch other fish, it will be inefficient, resulting in a waste of time and resources.\n2. Similarly, it wouldn't be logical for the fisherman in the question to use a net to catch large fish when a net was made to catch other fish.\n3. Thus the answer must be either water, considering that a water body is required for fishing to take place, or big fish as the other fish in the net would not have been their target.\n4. Water being much less probable than big fish, 'big fish' is the correct answer to this question.\nAnswer: A big fish\n\nInput: The boy had no patience for the task, so what did he do? Choices:\tA: he quit B: he worked hard C: he gave up D: he stayed E: he made up his mind\nRationales: It is clear from the question that the boy did not complete the task, as he had no patience for it.\nConsidering the 'no patience' response, one must pick an option that indicates him not remaining patient with the task, as the question expects.\n1. If the boy works hard for the task, that would entail he remains committed to it.\n2. 'Work hard' means remaining diligent or persistent with the task, which contradicts the answer.\n3.

The person could infer that they were calling a what? Choices: A: computer B: calculator C: receiver D: TV E: phone\nRationales: Given: \"The only sound heard by the PERSON was a series of BEEPS\". \n1. So since the phone line was damaged, and the other end of the line had a bad connection, the only sound the caller would hear is a series of beeps, and not the usual series of dialing, phone ringing, or person on the other end.\n2. So the caller could NOT hear any BUZZING sound on the other end of phone line since it was damaged and they had no idea if the phone was plugged in properly.\n3. So the other end of the call would be a CALCULATOR. \n4. A phone has an ear and a mouth piece which is not a receiver since it does not broadcast any sounds, but a receiver is.\n5. They should not refer or have any BUZZER on the other end either, again because the phone line is damaged.\n6. They should not have a TV on the other end either because a TV needs a broadcast channel to work and a phone is not a TV.\n7.

Next, think about each choice individually, determining whether it is related to writing tools in general or more specifically to pencils. Consider how the statement'made more sharp' is less specific than 'took lead out'.\n31. The statement 'took lead out' could mean something that happens to a pencil when the lead is taken out. It doesn't necessarily mean anything that a pencil can do in and of itself.\n32.

The question asks for grammatically incorrect questions. In English, this means that the two questions would need to be identical but a grammar rule broken.\nStep 2: Start with the first question in the pair. Is it true that the boy 'always eats with the right forks'.\nStep 3: The two questions compare the use of 'eats' and 'ate' as it has a different tense. In the first question, 'eats' is a present tense, this is incorrect as the boy would not always eat with a right fork.\nStep 4. This suggests that 'always' should be used in the second question to match the first, resulting in 'Is it true that the 'boy always eats with the with the right fork'.\nStep 5: However, this is grammatically incorrect as 'always' is being used to say is is true that the boy 'eats'. The use of 'always' does not make sense.\nStep 5. Instead, the grammar rules need to be broken with either an incorrect tense like the first question or an incorrect use of 'eats', such as it is false that 'the boy eats with the with a right fork'.\nFinal Step: The first sentence is grammar correct, while the second sentence is not.

The word \"shark\" refers to the popular US television show \"Happy Days.\" The phrase \"jump the shark\" refers to when a show becomes so popular that it begins to decline because the ideas run out.\n3. For the questions to be relevant to our test, the popularity of the show should not be relevant.\n4. We can eliminate choices such as K, L, and M because a dumb phone, L, or mono, M, is not the kind of phone you would wear while listening to music.\n\n5. Moving on, there are two choices that are likely related to headphones and music in some way.\n\n6. These are D: sidewalk and I: stereo.\n\n7. While D: sidewalk is not an appropriate choice, as it doesn't make sense in this context, it may give you some hints to other options.\n\n8. This leads you to I: stereo, which is used to create an audio signal consisting of multiple channels or sources.\n\n9. You can also note choices E: phoned in and H: triple, which are not used in the context in the question.\n\n10. From the remaining options, F: mixed makes the most sense because it refers to something related to stereos and more specifically refers to audio devices that contain more than one channel or sound source.\n\n11.

Similarly, both'sleep' and 'hunting for grub' involve being passive.\n6. In contrast, both 'thanking god' and 'feeling humiliated' may seem like they involve finding food as they require you to rely on something greater than yourself for assistance, and perhaps those entities will assist you.\n7. However, 'find food' is not the goal of the action, while 'feeling humiliation' is not likely to have much to do with the objective of alleviating hunger.\n8.

That leaves the 80's from 3 pm to 12 am.  That leaves the free time from 9 pm 1 pm from 1 am.  What time does that get me? I woke up at 11:50, I am leaving at 645 am.  My bed time is 1 am.

Choices: 1 1 PM 2 45 PM 3 PM 4 11 5 12:30 6 2 pm\nRationales: Based on the description, this is a basic schedule with two workdays divided by two weekends. The only way to interpret each time would be to determine what is represented in a way that corresponds to the questions given.\n1. The first question is, \"In my experience, it works better to keep the 2's from 8 AM to 7 PM.  That leaves the '80's from...\n2....3 PM to 12 AM.  That leaves free time from 9 PM to 1 PM.

E. They are stored in the harbour for a long time.\nRationales: We understand that the word \"they\" refers to \"the tires of a large Ship\". Now let's take the time to break down the sentences, making our understanding is as clear as possible.\n1. \"When it is put...\" shows the present perfect action of \"it\". This tells us the tire of a large ship has been put somewhere, and we need to identify where. (We say \"tire\" of a large ship. We do not say the \"tire\" of this ship, thus we can assume only one.)\n2. \"When it is...in the harbour..\" shows that the tire of a ship is in the harbour. If one tire is in the harbour, it stands to reason that it does not \"send to shore\". We rule out this choice.\n3. If 'Send to Shore' was the answer, the choice would read: 'The tires of a large ships send to shore.'\n4. It can also be stated as, \"Send to Shore: To send a large ship's things to the shore.\"\n5. We can rule out a choice if it is incompatible with the other choices stated.\n6. We know that \"Sold\" cannot be the answer because \"The tires of a Large Ship cannot be put (in the future) for we already said that it is on the Harbour. \n7. Likewise, we cannot say that \"The tires of large ship remain there\" as that means it stays on the Harbour.\n8. To be sold in the future is to be removed. Thus, it would have been placed elsewhere. \n9.  Similarly, if we said that the tire was deflated, we would assume that it was placed elsewhere rather than left on the harbour", "answer": "A: french government"}

The pendulum was originally created by Galileo Galilei. Choices:  A.the speed of an object B.the length of a cable C.the height of a tower D.the distance between points E.the density of a substance\nRationales:  1. The first sentence is describing a device used to measure distance. 2. The sentence lists the measurements that can be done with a pendulum, which are Speed, Height, Length and Distance between two objects. 3. The second sentence in the second paragraph is describing Galileo Galilee, which is not listed as a feature of the pendulum in the first paragraph. 4. Hence, the answer must refer to a feature of the pennule not mentioned in the first paragraph. Only one of the choices not mentioned in the first sentence can be the answer. 5.

{"text": "would directly provide food is the last option.\n5. This is because other choices do not explicitly describe the process of getting food through actions.\n6. The final options include a combination of 'hunt for food', 'prepare to go' and more.\n7. These are either describing different aspects of hunting for food or are very unlikely choices.\n8. Since options A and B are asking for something to praise or something to do, B is the least likely possibility. \n9. Options C and D are vague, describing emotions which may or may not lead to action. \n10. Choice E is the only option that could possibly lead to food.

Consider that sharp teeth are the only option here that involves anything that might be involved in the process of eating.\nStep 5. While a long neck does not necessarily mean the predator will attack the antelope, sharp teeth are a direct part of the process of eating, so the answer is D: sharp teeth.\nAnswer: D : sharp", "answer": "D: wires"}

The question states that it's an example of a pissy little girl and that the correct answer will be a synonym of pissy. Hence, it implies that the correct answer must describe a pissy little who is a girl and has the adjective 'little' with a connotation as negative, immature, arrogant and condescending.\nAs we cannot find the synonym in the given options, we need to analyze what pissy means and find its synonym.\nSince, pissy is derogatory and offensive, thus not suitable for a synonym.\nAs pissy relates to girls, however, a girl means a woman above 12 years, however, a woman who is a 'little girl' is 'not a girl'. Hence, one who is 'little' is called a 'baby'.\nTherefore, the correct answer is E. a babe (i.e. a little baby).\nHence, the given situation is that of a woman below 12 years. The correct answer should be a synonym of the word 'little', while pissy is an adjective. Pissy cannot be used as a synonym.

They can get it without telling anyone but if they do that, they can never get it again. What will they likely do next? Choices: A: hide it in a safe place B: throw it into the woods C: bury it deep in the ground D: toss it between bushes E: keep it with themselves\nRationales: First, understand some of the nuances of the question, such as: the person will only get to keep the treasure if they tell nobody about it.\nNext, look at the options provided. First, A: hide it in safety place. Safety place is vague. For the treasure to be safe, you need to bury it or put it somewhere else, so the option does not adequately explain how the person will retain possession of the treasure.\nSecond, B: throw it into woods. This does not retain possession of the treasurie -- that's why you are likely to get it back later.\nThe next options are A: bury it deep and B: toss it between bush. Both these options are methods of getting possession of the treasury since you are likely to get the possession of the treasure but not its safety.\nC: keep it with you. This keeps it with you, and you can have possession of it, but you can only enjoy its possession for a finite time, because you can't access it if you don't bring it with you.\nTherefore, the correct option is D: toss it between the bushes because it keeps its safety and possession for you.\nAnswer: D : toss it between the bush. This doesn't keep possession because you can't keep it with you, but it does keep safety and possession from theft, so it's the best answer\n\nInput: In 1849, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed making the US and what country a peace treaty?

Choices:  a: bone  b: honey  c: fish  d: fruit  e: meat\nRationales: The question is referring to meat, in pre-history, from three different sources: the ocean, the woods, and the forest's edge. In pre-history, the forest and forest edge would probably most resemble our modern day rainforest.\nSo, this leaves us with the choice: \"fish\". This choice is the one that would be on the list most often. And the question doesn't say anything about what meat was eaten in the oceans or the woods.  Additionally, the phrase \"the woods\" hints that the meat consumed in the woods would be something different to meat consumed from \"the ocean\" or \"the forest's edge\".\nAnswer: B: fish   \n\nInput: A new, unusual, and surprising development: the new type of the what that the scientist discovered in the rainforest, was the most surprising thing of all.

E: check whether the battery is fine\nRationales:\n1. Start with the question. The question asks you to find the most reasonable solution to the problem of no sound on a TV.\n2. List the given options. We can categorize the options into two: those that involve contacting a person or place outside of the room, and those that do not include such contact.\n3. Now, evaluate each option based on the question. The most reasonable solution is one that will solve the problem with as few steps or contacts as possible.\n4. If we choose an option that involves contacting outside the room, the person or place we need to contact will be listed separately afterward. When considering these options, we can decide if they are feasible or not based on context.\n5. Therefore the reasonable choices include options B, C, D, and E, which do not involve contacting outside the room. But option A: contact housekeeper is not reasonable because it requires two steps: contacting housekeeper and housekeeper taking action.\n6. Option C: find another TV is not reasonable because it includes a step of finding another TV.\n7. Option D: call another room is also not feasible because it requires an interpersonal contact for one person to call and receive a call from another person.\n8. Thus, the most reasonable solution is option E: check whether the batter is fine. Option E takes the least steps and only involves one single step as it is checking a common thing like the battery.\nAnswer:E: check whether the battery has a problem\n\n<h4 style=\"color:yellow; font-weight:700;text-align:center;\">\n<strong>Question</strong> : You are going to cook dinner on your computer", "answer": "E: library"}

Choices: 1. A: with scissors 2. B: by a machine 3. C: with a knife 4. D: with a sharper than knife\nRationales: The answer to this question is a little counter-intuitive, but if you analyze it carefully, the answer will become obvious. To answer this question, we first have to look at what a pizza is. A pizza is: 1) a kind of cake 2) a slice of cake The term \"cake\" means that a pizza is a baked dough with a filling/flavoring. Next, let's look at the options: A: With Scissors. Scissors are a cutting tool designed to produce clean, accurate cuts that can handle many different kinds of materials. With scissors, one could make clean cuts into the pizza, but it is not a \"traditional\" cutting method used to cut pizzas, so the answer is not one. B: By a machine: While a machine can easily cut the material, it is not a tool used in pizza making, so again, the answer is not one, unless that machine is a pizza oven. C: With a knife: A knife can cut into the dough of the pizza, but the knife will not be sharper than the blade of a knife. The answer is not one D: With sharper than a knife: Knives have different grits, and the higher the grit, the sharper the angle of the blade becomes and cuts deeper.

Riley fell of the high bar.\nShe told the children that gymnastics is what? Choices: A: fun B: serious C: dangerous D: safe E: difficult\nRationales: If Ms. Riley had a 'bit of an accident' on the high bar, then she had to fall off. It is unlikely that she would have chosen to get off willingly. Therefore, this must be a case where falling is dangerous. She must be telling the children that gYNAMSTIcs is dangerous, since it is clear from the question and the context that the children know not to fall off a high bar.

Choices:  a: an adventurous one B: a simple one C: one of great financial gain D: a one of personal gain E: one of the heart\nRationales: This is an instruction that describes two different paths.  Choice a is an adventurous one, and choice b is a simple one. \nOne of great financial gain, one of personal gain, and one of the heart are alternative paths (which may or may not be chosen).\nFirst, look at Choice E \u2013 One of the heart \u2013 this choice is not related to a specific path, is instead a way of referring to paths that appeal to his heart.\nNext, Choice D, is an alternative path.  Like the others, it is a way of expressing an option that is not one of the adventurous path or the others. Thus, Choice D is not relevant to determining which path the man will take or the crossroad in which he has made.\nNext, Choices B and A are incompatible, it is impossible for a simple path to be of great financial gain. So, these are equally ruled out.\nNext, Choose from C \u2013 great financial gain and A \u2013 adventurous.  Great financial gain is compatible with A for adventure.  Thus, Choice C would be selected.  However, Choice A \u2013 of adventure \u2013 is not compatible with a simple path.  Thus, Choices C and A are ruled out.\nNext Choices A and E are compatible.

Choices: 1: Secretary 2: Doctor 3: Gardner 4: Engineer 5: Teacher\nRationales: Questions that describe jobs and tasks tend to require a thorough understanding of what each of the given jobs entails.\nWhen you think about it, none of the given job descriptions include a verb that indicates that the person has completed their job.  Instead, all of their descriptions mention their duties and tasks.\n\nExamine the given options. Consider each job individually. The secretary's job does not require doing anything after the job is completed.  While a doctor treats ill people and fixes injuries, the job is not done after treatment.  It involves making diagnoses and giving care, both of which keep the doctor busy.\n\nSimilarly, the teacher's job also does not involve finishing, since there is a constant focus on learning. A gardener has to keep the garden maintained and working, so the job of a gardener is not done after the work is completed.  The gardener is still busy throughout the job.\n\nLastly, an engineer's job includes not just design and making but also testing.  Thus, the work is not truly done after an engineer completes their job. They remain busy.\n\nConsequently, the most important job is the job that is the hardest to accomplish after the job is complete.  That is because after completing its work, everything else continues while the work of doing the job is essentially complete.

This can be done by evaluating which of the qualities best aligns with the question.\n\n1. A: great a math. For the question, this option is simply not relevant. This is not a quality that makes a person excellent. Instead, it's a skill they need to be successful as a salesperson.\n2. B: strong sales.

Their product quality will decline 3. They will face competition 4. They will be forced to sell assets 5. They will increase their fundraising\nRationales: By analyzing the question, it would clearly suggest that the company would be underfunded. There is a possibility that the company will do any of the other, but that would not solve the problem of underfunding.\nStep 2: Looking at the choices, it is clear by the definition of underfunding that option 1 and option 5 are not the correct ones.\nStep 3: Option 3 seems somewhat related to what is likely to happen as an outcome of underfunding (i.e. the company will be forced to face competition). However, option 3 refers to the possibility of the situation, not necessarily the eventual result of the situation. \nStep 4: The options 2 and 4 may seem like logical choices since underfunding might affect the product or the company might sell assets to get funds. However, the question talks about what is likely to happen. So, option 2 would imply that underfunding will certainly affect the quality of the product, not just that it is something likely. \nStep 5: Since option 4 is also not a logical outcome of underfunding, we are looking for the option that is closest or most related to the question and the definition of the term underfunding.\nThe answer would be option 3.\nOption 3 is in direct contrast to option 2, which makes it an appropriate answer, as the likely outcome of underfunding is not the certainty of affecting the quality of the product.\nAnswer: C option.\n\nInput: A baby's diaper is soiled, what can a parent clean it with?

ML is out as it doesn't say that it's the best food.\n4. KJ is also out because it's not the best food nor the most expensive food, so this one is eliminated.\n5.

In these situations what, if at all, should happen to ensure an interesting end to the competition? Choices: \tA: The score must be evened out. B: The weaker team must be allowed to play as well. C: They should let the stronger team win\nRationales: The question concerns what should happen when one side dominates the other and there is a risk of a dull end to the competition.\nThe question implies that an equal number of points is desirable, because otherwise the competition is too boring. So, the score must be evened or made more even.\nThinking further, if one team is strong and the other weak, the stronger team should not play at all. Instead, the points can be simply scored by the stronger team without there even needing to be a competition. However, letting the stronger team win is only interesting if it is a competition, rather than them winning simply by scoring points while the weaker team is not playing.\nSo, the answer should, ultimately, be that an equal number of scores is desired. Thus, C: They should let one team win is the one option that meets these requirements, even though there needs to be a game.\nAnswer: C - they should let one team win.\n\nInput: A new sporty shoe brand is trying to get some media coverage.

In terms of the nature of these choices, the phrase \"safe, comfort place\" is describing a situation where people are relaxed.

Making a tight fist can suggest anxiety, an effort to control and relaxation, none of which would be possible in such a comfortably relaxed place.\nThe other options like B) \"make a fist\" and E) \"do all of the above\" aren't actually very clear and relevant in context, they don't really apply.

The statement indicates that either A) 80% is a high score and a generally acceptable grade, or B) 80% has special significance beyond standard grading. \n7. Since the question doesn't suggest, A, we can first dismiss it. \n8. Let's move on to the other options. \n9. Looking at option B: \"I'm feeling generous.\" \n10. We can reject this option since we are unsure if the speaker is feeling generous or if the speaker expects a high grade.\n11. Option C: \"I'm giving you some room and some critique,\" makes one think the speaker is giving the listener an opportunity to improve, possibly through a low grade and/or the possibility of feedback. \n12.

{"text": "deals with eating food is 'hunt for food'.\n5. The other options deal with other issues, rather than addressing the immediate need to avoid hunger.\n6. For example, thanking god implies the person's prayer for help from above, but it does not involve directly seeking out food to resolve the immediate issue of hunger.\n7. Similarly, the other options are likewise more of an attempt to deal with the person's emotions around hunger or to think more broadly about other circumstances which caused it, rather than directly looking for solutions to the practical need to obtain food.\n8. This leaves the correct answer as D: the hunt for food. The neolithic man was hungry so he hunted for food to resolve his hunger.\nAnswer: D. hunt for food\n\nInput: A good way to stop an intruder is with what? Choices: A: silence B: a gun C: an ally D: a loud noise E: security\nRationales: The question asks that we find a \"good way\" to \"stop\" an \"intruder.\" From this we can infer some criteria for the answer. The \"good way\" must be effective, and it must be able to \"stop\" the intruder. It must be able to do so in a \"good way,\" which suggests that there might well be a more evil way of stopping intruders: the evil way would not be good and would not be acceptable.\n\nThinking of ways to stop an intruder by themselves may not be very fruitful, since such an option would seem to suggest a good way to stop the intruder. But thinking of good ways to stop the intruders is a different scenario. In this situation, we might start categorizing our options. This is an exercise where you think about the meaning of the word \"good\" to understand the options better by grouping them into two categories of good and evil.\n\nIf we look at the given answer choices, we find that choice E: security is the only suitable answer. Choice B: a gun could indeed be good or evil, but it cannot be said that it is good in this specific scenario. However, choice D: a loud noise can be either good or evil.\n\nWe don't know how this intruder will respond to a sound. If the intruder is in a hurry, the sound may stop him,", "answer": "D: orchestra"}

Therefore, 'hunt for food' is the correct answer.\nRationales: Answers: D: The question mentions that the neolithic person is \"hungry\".\n7. Because they are hungry, they will need to locate food.\n8. One way to locate food is 'hunt', which is the correct answer. It's the only choice that will lead to this person finding food.\n9. Other options are merely reactions, and they alone cannot feed a hungry person.\n10. Additionally, option E: prepare to go is not a logical choice. Preparing to go implies planning an action, but that action is unclear as the question asserts that the person is already \"hungry.\" \nFinal Step: The correct answer is D: hunt for food.\nAnswer: D. hunt for food\n\nInput: What do people often feel when they see a man with a beard? Choices: 1.  A: They are happy. 2.  B: They are proud. 3.  C: They feel inferior. 4.  D: They envy him. 5.  E: They think he looks bad\nRationales: A: They are happy: People do feel happy when they see a man having a beard, but this is not always the case. \nB: They are proud: People may feel proud when they see a man grow a beard, but generally people feeling proud from beardeness is not true. \nC: They feel inferior: By default people do not feel inferior towards a man with a bearded look and this is a wrong answer. \nD: They envy him: Though many people definitely do envy a man with a beared look, this is not the only possible answer. \nE: They think he looks Bad: It is definitely not true, that people think a man in general look bad when he has a beared look, and this option is also out of question. \nThis is a case where all the options are not correct and the question is confusing.

This is because in neolithic times, people would typically have to hunt animals for food or would rely on a farming culture, both of which would be inaccessible to this neolithic person.\n6.

Choices:  a) is not really for him B) is not well suited for him C) is not the type of thing he would do D) he is not quite good enough to do E) was actually too easy for him\nRationales:\n1. The question mentions that it is possible for someone to be the right choice for a job, but the work they are being asked to do is not really for them, well suited for them, the type of thing they would do, good enough for them, or too easy for them.\n2. The question's wording and choice of words seem to suggest two options that are in opposition to one another, making an X or Y choice for the answer more appropriate than looking at the four options provided.\n3. Considering the given context, a person might not be suited to a job based on personal preferences (like the desire to do something different from their work or if they feel it is too easy for them). Or, the job might have been inappropriate or poorly adjusted with their skills.\n4. The task may have involved something that was more suited to the person's skills and interests, requiring more skill at work and less time spent to complete the task. \n5. Alternatively, it might involve something that would be more difficult, requiring more time spent to complete the job.\n6. Hence, looking at the options provided, the word \"too easy for him\" can suggest that the work was too simple or that it required little effort, while the rest does not necessarily suggest the same.\n7. Similarly, \"too hard for him\" would refer to the difficulty of completing the given task, while the rest is still not directly related to the difficulty of the task.\n8.

Choices: A: wood, B: staples, C: hammers, D: saw\nRationales: The question essentially says that every carpenter needs each of the following four items: wood, staples, hammers, and saws.\n\nOption A\nWood is a material and it is an important material for carpentry as indicated by the other choice, therefore, it makes much sense that every carpenter has to have some of it, which can be easily used as an answer.\n\nOption B\nStaples are also important to every carpenter as every carpenter has their own special way that they use staples. So, every carpenter uses staples as well as other materials such as wood.\n\nOption C and D\nHammers and saws are also essential to every carpenter because they use these tools many times.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A, \"wood.\"\n\nAnswer: A: wood\n\nInput: Some people want to go to school.

As the question asks for a term that can be used, none of the choices are necessary to the question. \nStep 1: 2 terms in the passage, \"Dad\" and, \"and his son\" need to be taken into consideration in answering the question. \nAs the options only pertain to the stone mason, \nit is unlikely they would be necessary to the understanding of the question. \nIt is likely \"stonemason\" is a term used to describe the craftsman, which can be used with the father and his son.\nStep 2: Among the choices, \"fixed\" is the closest option as the father and son are in need of assistance from the stone mason. \nAs the father and son are the ones in a predicament, a possible response could be to give them a quick fix. \nThere would be little benefit for the father and son if the stone mason did a perfect job, so the father and son would prefer, and the stone mason would likely give them, \"a quick fix\".\nStep 4: Although the father and son are unlikely to find a need for a stonemason to rebuild the work.\nStep 5 : So, \"quick fix\" is the most likely option because it aligns with most choices and the most context.\nStep 6 : Therefore, the answer is A Quick Fix.\nAnswer: A. quick fix\n\nInput: A cake has a certain, special flavor.

This can only be referring to space travel and traveling to other planets.\nNext, we can see that we are in the future since the question states \"in the future\".

The options do not make sense when used in the wrong context, therefore, eliminating choices: \"sorry\", \"writing\", and \"acting\", as these do not make sense when applied to who Marx was.

We are asked to select the most popular brand of a detergent.\n2. So, we have to examine each option to determine which one is most popular.\n3. The first option, D: Tidy mind is a word, in this case, with nothing to do with a detergent. This option is not relevant to the question and is therefore excluded.\n4. The second option, B: Dirt Busters, is clearly a brand of detergent because the second part of its name is \"detergent\" and it is the type of product that we are asked about. \n5. This option is also more likely to be true than the other choices \n6. As such, this option is one of the answers available.\n7. The third option is \"Cleaner than Dirt\", which is another detergent brand.  We do not need to select any detergents except the ones with names starting with \"D\", so we can eliminate this option.

{"text": "deems hungry a problem is option B: 'hunt for food.' This is because the remaining choices are passive responses to or reactions about being hungry. 'Feel humiliated' refers to feeling shame due to being hungry,'sleep' is seen as accepting the hunger and choosing to close one's eyes to it, and 'prepare to go' means the person has recognized the issue and is getting ready to 'go' (to find something to eat).\n5.

{"text": "could be a'solution' to the problem of hunger is to prepare to go.\n5. All other choices either aren't really directly related to finding food or may be more generally related to alleviating feelings.\n6. For example 'hunt for food' may be the solution if you mean finding food, but 'hunt' is a hunting game that doesn't actually relate to food. \n7. Similarly 'humiliation' may be related to food, but the situation describes extreme hunger so that wouldn't be a good solution. \n8. 'Prepare to go' and'sleep' in this way may both help alleviate hunger for a short time.\n9. However, preparing to go would require resources, knowledge about where to find food, and time.\n10. Thereby, while both of these might help alleviate food, neither solves the issue for the person they are directly related to.\n11. Meanwhile, sleep is a solution that could help temporarily alleviate hunger until access to food, however it is not directly related to finding food either.\n12. The remaining option is to prepare to go, who prepares in order to eventually get access to food, so that is the correct answer in this context.\nAnswer: D : Prepare to go\n\nInput: \"What is a funny way to ask someone out for a date?\" Choices:  A \"Hey bitch, wanna hold hands?\" B \"Hey bitch can I hold your hand?\" C  D \"Yo bitch wanna grab a bite?\" E \"Yo bitch, you want to grab something to eat?\"\nRationales: The answer is E \"Yo Bitch, Do ya Want To Grab Some Food?\".

The correct answer is D: sleep.\nAnswer: D\n\n### Demotional:\nWhat is the main idea of a sentence?\n\n### Demostration:\nThe main idea of a sentence is the thought, concept, or story that it tells. It is also possible to view the main idea as the point that the sentence wants to convey. In short, it is the central purpose of the sentence and the most important part of it.\n\n### Example:\nBecause I was hungry, I ate the leftover pizza from last night.\nThe main idea here is 'Because I was hungr', since eating pizza has to do with getting food. The main idea tells you the answer.\n\n### Input:\nThe girl was hungry, and in addition, after playing games, she was very tired.\nThe main idea of this sentence is _____.\n\n### Rationales:\nIt's helpful to first understand the question thoroughly and dissect it.  The question asks for the main idea of the sentence.  Once you understand what it's asking, you can start by focusing on the verb in the second part of the sentence.  The second half of this sentence reads \"in addition,...\".  The word \"in addition\" makes clear that another idea is coming, meaning it's not the main idea.  Therefore, the main idea of the first part of the sentence is the word after \"after\", which is likely to be \"playing\".  This means that the main idea of the entire sentence is 'playing'.\nRationales:\nAnswer:\n\n### Input :\nWhich of the following countries has more than one of these problems (illiteracy, drought, corruption, or deforestation) as a serious problem according to this 2015 survey of 177 countries?

Which of the following is it appropriate to say to her? Choices: \nA: congratulations B: way to go C: well done D: thanks \nE: well done\nRationales:\nIn order to understand which answer is the most appropriate, it is important to first determine the context, then apply reason based on the person's mood and behavior. \nStart by considering the word \"disappointed\".\nDisappointment means someone is not pleased with something. \n\nA person who is disappointed about their score would likely not be pleased or happy with it.\nMoreover, if they aren't happy with their result, they may be a bit stressed or down as well.\n\nWhich of the following statements is considered most appropriate for a 60% score?\n\nWhen it comes to \"congratulations\", \"way to go\", and \"well done\", all have positive connotations but likely cannot be used appropriately in this scenario.\n\nThese statements would more likely be directed to someone who succeeded in their goal or completed something they wanted to achieve.\n\n\"Thanks\" would be more suitable for a friend to say to someone, but isn't necessarily something to say to someone when you received low score.\n\nFinally, \"well done\" is not a commonly used phrase, but if one was to say it, it should be something that is sincere and used to make someone feel happier about something.\n\nTherefore, \n\nAnswer is", "answer": "B: opera"}

Choice a: Houston: This is incorrect, as the population in Houston is not close to New York City's. \nChoice b: Dallas: This is incorrect, since the population in Dallas is close to one tenth of New York City's population. Choice c: San Antonio: This is incorrect, because according to the Population of San Antonio, the population of San Antonio isn't close to New York City in terms of number, despite being the most populous city in Texas.

Things always tend to be difficult when you don't have faith in yourself or have been deprived of it.\nThe correct response is C &F &J because these ones mean that things will appear simple because you will be confident and willing to do things. The correct answer is C and F and J: \"that things will appear simple because I believe in myself and I am willing to do things.\"\nIt's important you believe in yourself because then you will be able to achieve what you desire.

Choices: 1. have a job 2. be lazy 3. get a job 4. have the work ethic to succeed 5. be professional\nRationales: The context of the question clearly states that people choose \"to work from the comfort of home\" instead of choosing to \"get a job\", so we are looking to determine which of the given statements are positive about a person who works from home, and which are not. \nStep 1) A: Having a job is not necessarily positive, because many people have a job and they are not necessarily professional or even good at their job. However, having a professional job is a positive attribute.\nStep 2) B: \"Being Lazy is not positive, because being lazy is a negative attribute.\nStep 3) C: \"Getting a job\" is positive because it means that someone is getting a job and trying to succeed.\nStep 4) D: Having the work ethic to actually be successful is also positive, because it means that the person is actually trying to be successful and not just \"trying to succeed.\" E: \"Be professional\" is also very positive because it means the person has a career, is well regarded at his job, and is someone who works hard.\nStep 5) Therefore, since the question is asking about working from home versus getting a job, and only getting a job is a positive choice, the answer must be C: \"to get a job.\"\nAnswer: C: \"to get\"\n\nInput: Dad made his own what?

They are in a picture of a party or gathering (party in the title), and they seem to be very busy.\nNext ask yourself: Is the first person very busy? No. They are at a gathering with a smiling face and a drink in their hand. In fact, the first person seems to be enjoying themselves. \nNext ask yourself, is the second person enjoying themselves? No, they seem to be very stressed!\nThis leaves us with: The second person is sad.  \nSo, we are looking for what is the most likely for the guyl in the picture: what will make him feel less stressed and feel better?\nOne option is to drink a lot of alcohol: that will feel happy. So, one option is B: happy. The party is with friends and in general, makes people feel happier.\nAnother option is to sit in a corner and cry which will make him feel more depressed and sad. So, one option could be E: depressed or F: angry. People sometimes turn to drinking to release their anger, so if you feel angry, sometimes you can let off steam by drinking alcohol.\nHowever, since the guy looks happy, this means he's probably most likely to continue having fun.\nSo, the correct answer is F: ANGRY.\nAnswer: F: ANGRY\n\nInput: You're going on a field trip with your entire family.

To understand that one doesn't need to use a lot of effort, we should check the meaning of the word 'effort'.\nEffort here means the work needed to do something. Hence, if someone is saying that one should not need to use a lot effort, clearly it will mean less effort.

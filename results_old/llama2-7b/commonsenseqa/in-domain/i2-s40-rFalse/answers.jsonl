So, \"trouser leg\" is excluded. An instance of the analogy is also presented where\n\n\"you would find a lot (usually the majority) of children in mother's hair\", which is more likely than \"the sick bay\"\nbecause \"mother's hair\" is where children are more likely to be.\n\nAs well,", "answer": "D: petting zoo"}

{"text": "We can all agree that all human beings have one common thing in common: the ability to think and act. No matter who is involved, communication happens when people meet with one another to discuss something on common interests. Of course communication can be difficult to understand if a person doesn't have the right skill or doesn't put proper effort into the effort. To explain, in the English class we have, there are students whose performance is pretty good and bad. When we have a class discussion it can be pretty hard to understand if one student asks question in German since the others haven't learned it, especially in a short conversation. Besides, we don't want to hurt their feeling since we're good people..\n\n### Input\nLearning languages is different.  Even in a fully immersive environment, you are likely to make mistakes, and mistakes will cause misinterpreting, which will cause discomfort, and which will cause what? Choices:A: better communication B: Overthinking C: friction D: misunderstanding E: a headache\n\n### Answer\nOf course learning languages can be hard. The reason why it's hard is the way we learn things from a young age. All human beings have one main thing in common: the possibility of thinking and acting. No matter who's involved, communication happens through meetings of people with common interests. Of course, if people are not good at communicating effectively because they didn't put their effort into using these skills, they will be difficult to learn languages. Learning different languages requires a person to have a good and right way of being taught.\n\n### Input Learning languages is different.  You are likely to make mistakes even in a fully immersed environment, mistakes will cause miscommunications, mistakes will cause what?  Choices: A: better communication B Overthinking C: discomfort D: understanding E: headaches\n### Answer:\nLearning languages can be pretty scary.  It's because you have to learn a language that you don't completely understand. When you are not able to figure out what is being said or explain things in a way that you understand you might get nervous and might not want to explain it or just simply learn it. This may cause misunderstanding with a person who can't help with helping you learn. Of course you won't enjoy that, so you might not want to", "answer": "C: frustration"}

That includes knowing the maximum number of mistakes you can make without starting over with the next person's instructions.\n\n### Maximum Number of Mistakes\n\nIn the example above, the person whose instructions you are responding to can make up to 3 mistakes and you can make up to 2. If you both make more than you're allowed, you will both have to start over with the next person on the list!\n\n### Task:\n\n> Please write a response to the instructions above according to the following rules:\n\n1. Complete the instructions in your response, using the words or phrases in italics in the original instructions.  Remember, you are responding to a request, making observations that are more what than the other choices.\n2. Complete the last request (the answer in italics in the first instruction).\n3. When you complete the last request, use one of the following:\n\na) \"I understood, and was able to complete the task.\"\nb) \"I didn't understand. I did ___.\"\nc) \"I understood, but wasn't able to complete the task. I tried ____.\"\n>\n\nFor example, the first person might write to you as follows:\n\n> Instructions: Write a response to the instructions below according to the following rules.\n> \n> First, write the instructions in as few words as possible.\n>  3. Use the third request as the prompt to continue writing a second set of instructions.\n\n## Instructions:\n> Please write as many instructions as you can! Each instruction should describe how to do something that has not been described.\n>\n> In each instruction, you are responding in some way to a past instruction.\n>", "answer": "A: death"}

{"text": "This is a good example of the use of the 4-year-olds rule, i.e. \"If they would have needed to explain it for a 4-year-old, then we need a better explanation\" when trying to understand the intended meaning of a question.\n\nThe question: \"Where is a horse likely live?\" is asking what location would most likely house a horse since the question specifically indicates that the horse \"live.\" This, if it was in written format would be considered a grammatically incorrect question since it fails to include the \"where\" and \"live\" elements properly. \"Where does a horse live?\" would be appropriate. However, in this example, the text does not suggest that it is asking a question or has incorrect wording. However, it is an instruction to write a response. In addition, we're not given an indication that there is a rule requiring a 4-year old response. So, we know that if we do this type of thing in a response, we are going to need a better explanation. But why? It's because the intended wording of the question is: \"The place where a horse most likely to live.\"\n\nThis then leads to other questions regarding the intent. Why is the text asking for a \"response\" and not a question or just another instruction? Is the text expecting a response or is the intent to be an example of something that is not written in a proper form? Is the intent to test the ability to understand an instruction in this format? And if so, what is the correct format? The text indicates, if the intent is to determine if we are able to express our thought process using only written commands then what's the instruction to answer in a correct format?\n\n### Inputs:\nThis question contains two paragraphs and each paragraph contains 2 to 3 sentences (some sentences are one or two words).

I guess to be fair a concert could count as an event at a stock market...maybe the musician sells stocks...I mean it may be a stretch but technically what was happening on stage could count as a stock market event.\n\n### Detailed response:\nYou'd also have to be pretty close up close to singers. There is an option for B, Concert, and you could possibly be up close to singers on stage. I think most people are far away and using the microphone. Not to sound like I am being snotty, but I don't care that they are singing at stage left versus stage right because I wouldn't care in any situation what side they are on.\n\nAnother thing is that I would have put a concert in that question, not tv studio because a concert could literally be one of several things, whereas a tv studio question is more precise. I'm just saying that a concert is more open ended than a tv studio, so why mention it in a concert questions?\n\nThe only other problem I do have is that a concert is not just live entertainment, but in most cases it is live entertainment and recorded in a recording studio. I wouldn't count a concert as a stock market event, because one might have to know something about stocks to consider it being a stock market event. I could consider it, as in maybe the band plays the same song every time they play the same concert, but i don't really consider that as a stock market event because I don't really consider the song being the same every time a concert, if that makes scense. I'm not trying to be a smart guy...

{"text": "- John was complete in his examination.\n- To be creative, one need not be a great artist or writer.\n- Schools are rarely built in empty fields but are usually located in urban centers.\n- Many of the greatest writers and artists were only \"tinkerers\" who only tried writing or art at the last minute in an attempt to find a way to make their lives meaningful.\n- Schools in the US are often built in areas which, from the first glance, one can say are residential, community, and commercial zones.\n\n### Sample outputs:\n\n- John wasn't thorough in his examination. It's because he only gave a perfunctoral examination.\n- I thought I have no creativity. I can paint and draw, and I can make jewelry. Why is it that I'm not artistic or creative? Why I can't draw a tree? Even I can't draw something as simple as tree.\n- It is best to locate a school in a residential area. The reason lies on the fact that residents of the area would more likely encourage the school.\n- I am no artist or writer. All I have is talent. Though this is my talent.\n- Schools often get built in residential areas. It allows the students to have short walks to and from school. Not to mention, parents are more likely to look at the school as a blessing especially if it was build near their homes.\n- A teacher, I hope you can pass my grade with flying colors. But please don't have any creativity to add on my grades.\n- You have an artistic creativity within you. That may not seem evident as much as other things since it is not obvious, but you possess other creative skills.\n- School should be built in community or residential area.

Science shows that it is partially hereditary, which means we take some of our inherited characteristics from our parents, who take half from each of their parent, and so on, which means that we inherit half of our \"creative spirit.\"\n\n### Input\nIn the 1950's and 60's art programs were taken out of schools. As a result, many young people who might have had the ability to go on to become artists, now have the option to go on to other things instead, leaving us in a creative vacuum.\n\n### Response\nYou are so right, in the 195l's and '60s, schools started to cut all art classes. I agree that some people should be allowed to focus on the arts, and become artists to share their beauty.\n\n### Input \nYou are so correct to insist that those with no interest in art, be allowed, even encouraged to follow their interest, instead of being forced into art classes, and suffering by attentiveness.\n\n### End Of Task\n\n### Example 1:I agree with your ideas, your articulation of your opinions is impecible. \n\n### Example2:You seem to have no creative ability at all, as well as no intelligence either, to realize how ridiculous your last two sentences sound.\n\n### Example3:I agree with your idea, though I believe you haven't quite explained your idea properly, as you have stated it without detail, which I believe you could do better with.", "answer": "B: create art"}

It was easy to get lost of track of what the instructions were because a lot of things were included with the two parts. I wish there would have been more clarification into the glossary so I knew which word to use to say what. However, I do not blame the maker because the challenge is just meant to be a challenge, not make easy.\n\n## Revision\n\nI believe that the instruction given for the challenge was clear to some, but not all. I also think it was not clear that the output would be about the word that was given, instead of what the entire sentence meant.

{"text": "We've been working with questions recently where the input has been a title that requires a response to be appropriate under the title.  It's been going very well and it's one of the main things we're working on at the moment and has been the case for the entire session.  If we try and write a question where the input is a sentence, that has a title, I think it's a little bit of a stretch.  It's not completely impossible and, perhaps, it can be done.  I don't think there's anything wrong with an attempt, per se; however, trying to build a response to a question that looks a bit more like the first instruction seems a little bit of a better option.\n\n\nIt can't be that hard to write a response to a question where the input isn't even a title but a sentence.  The instructions describe something and there's a question that follows.  There are options and those options are all answers that follow the question.  It's a fairly easy, straightforward thing to write a response.  The only thing that's required is that the response be appropriate.  It needs to be appropriate to the question, appropriate to the instruction, appropriate to the context of a conversation that we're attempting to build in here with an automated system.\n\nAn appropriate response to this instruction is going to require that the response is \"thorough\".  The only really problematic choice is the one that describes a response as \"intricate\".  \"Intricate\" is not a word that we've used since we established that we were working with vocabulary.  Anybody can look up any dictionary and see as much.  Now we have dictionaries. \n\nWe've looked up a bunch and all of them say the same thing.

You might not complete the sentence that is instructing you.  A common pattern is to complete the sentence with \"Choose either X or Y, X or Y, or X, Y and Z\" or some other phrase.  If you are stuck, think carefully about the first \"choice\" first.  The second \"choice\" second, third, fourth, etc. are likely to be synonyms.  So don't get frustrated.\n\nThere is good reason for using \"choose one\".  The first choice narrows the list of acceptable options. The second and third choice are synonyms.  Sometimes people use just one word.  But when they do be aware that there is more than one way to interpret that first word.  So, the choice instruction should tell you what to choose to avoid error.  What is an acceptable choice should be explained and the expected results be given.  A good example would be: \n\n**Choose one**:  [a] I will [b] I am going to [c] The train is coming \n\n[a] is an acceptable answer  but is not the question.  [b] and [c] are acceptable answers but indicate that the first element of the task was not completed (The train is coming). \n\nChoose one is not always the best way to instruct an answer.  This instruction can be overly limiting because choices  are not always the same.  Another good choice might be:\n\n**Write an answer**   **that is either [a] this or [b] the other** \n\n[b] is often not the same as, [a].\nAs a final check, the responses can also be used to check if an appropriate response was given.  Be careful with these though, you might accidentally find out the right answer.\n\n### Test:\n\n**Choose two**: [a] [b]\n\n**Write an explanation** that explains how and why you came to the conclusion you did.

In the first example, you need to apply the definition to the given input \"He waited for his friends at the squash court\" by matching the input to the definition with the best match in the definition (country club if you were correct with the definition of rich person's house). You then check the match score with the definition to know if you got it right. The question \"What is the best way to create idea?\" asks you to answer with  \"Express yourself\" as the definition suggests that you'll create an idea by yourself.\n\nTo define a rule, you've to write a dictionary with a key and a match function. The key of the dictionary must respect the structure of the match function and the match function will only be used in the match function of the dictionary.\n\n### Matching\nTo match you need the following:\n1. Key: a group of tokens inside a function.\n2. Match Function: It takes a string and return a dictionary.\n\n**Example:** \n```python\n# This is a dict with a key and a matching function\ndef match(key, match_function, match_dict):\n    try:\n        r = match_function(key)\n        match_dict[key] = r\n        return match_dict\n    except:\n        return None\n\n# This is the rule definition\nrules = {\n    # A dict containing the keys and the match function\n    'key': r # key, rule = {...},\n    #...\n    'key' : 'He waited for his friend...'\n}\n```\nThe dictionary `rules` has a `key` with the keyword `He waited for his friend`. \nThe function `match` takes a string as input and will match the string to the `key`. In this example, the function `match` matches the string `He waited for his fri...` to the `key`. If the function return `True`, it means there is a match and we create a match dictionary.\n\n## 1.

{"text": "A \n\n# 30 Day Meditation Challenge Day 29\nDay 29: You will not be a victim; it's been your choice all along. You've chosen your mindset and you've chosen what you expect. Now, you just have to stop telling yourself you are a victim and start telling yourself you are the victor in your own life. You have always had a choice and you have chosen not to be great, but you can choose again; and you will once you wake up and begin to think about positive choices you can make.\n\n### Challenge:\nYou will not be a victim, you are the victor. Be mindful and focus on only the positive outcomes in your life. Work towards being victorious; then tell the people around you that you are, that is if you want to. Otherwise, don't say anything.\n\n### What does this mean?\n\nDo not go through life thinking you are a victim of the situation at hand; and to the person who may be saying that they are, do not believe them; help the person realize that they are the victor in their own life. This is the one place where you are in charge, you can help the person. You cannot do this for everyone around you, but you will be able to impact the person who says they are a victim.\n\n### My Takeaway:\nIf we really want to be successful in life, then the first lesson to follow should be to realize we are the victor. When we've given someone a choice in life and it's not something we want to be a part of; then we should just stop participating. We need to stop and realize that the other person is also a victim, or we can be the same. Once we've come to this simple realization, we will have less trouble dealing with the outcome of our situation.", "answer": "C: victorian house"}

If you need more information, the other responders may be able to provide it.\n\n### Input\n\nIt turns out there are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.  - Hamlet, Act I, Scene V\n\n### Response\nAnother reference to heaven implies that Shakespeare was familiar with Christian doctrine.  Given the context, however, the quote refers to other worlds than the Christian heaven and hell.  It is unclear what else Hamlet's words refer to, but he appears shocked about them, and their mention is so abrupt that it makes one wonder how the rest of the conversation would have gone.  Hamlet would have been a most uninteresting character if he merely expressed his acceptance of the unknowability of things.\n\n### Comments:\nShakespeare's use of this quote is so enigmatic that it leaves much to the imagination and a mystery in the story (what other worlds exist?).\n\n### Instrument:\nWhile Hamlet, who has been a student at Wittenberg University, appears to speak in the Elizabethan English of the play, his actual comments appear to be entirely ungrammatical sentences.", "answer": "C: music store"}

It was good weather, and she wanted to make sure the garden was working properly.  The neighbors were away, and her son was only home for the weekend.  She decided to walk the dogs.  They were getting older, after all, and it was getting more difficult.  She was glad to have them now because they always made her feel safe.  Walking them was also a chance to clear her head.  She knew her daughter was worried about her, but she wanted to do everything she could for herself.  Her health had been a constant battle, and she would not let on to anyone how hard it was.  She started walking after dinner because it was cooler out in the evening.  The dogs kept her company and made her feel like she always was someone's babysitter.  She decided to take a different path than normal this time, because she felt she needed something different.  She had always walked in the same direction, and she knew it was time to explore more of the park and the city.  It was all part of her decision process to find something a little more fulfilling.  She walked for a few hours, as usual, but this time she wasn't as careful about when the walk started.  She was just beginning to enjoy herself when she tripped on the rocks near the water. Luckily, she was able to right herself, and her dogs just wagged their tails and started walking again.  She felt her heart start to pound, but she was sure she was okay.  Her only concern at the moment was that it was getting dark.", "answer": "E: town"}

{"text": "If one answers the question correctly, the response should demonstrate understanding of the question, in order to make a decision.\n\n### Input The only way to keep that monstrous creature from smashing through our flimsy barrior is to block its route with our army.  We can afford to throw in a lot of underpowered troops.  They may die but they won't actually hurt our cause.  Even if the aliens manage to kill all of our cheap troop that aren't able to fight back and we lose, is that a bad thing?  Consider that each soldier we lose won't be able to breed and will instead just become a useless cannibal once he or she has died.  Also, a dying solider is far more likely than a surviving solider to kill an alien since he is more likely to be injured in his attempt than a healthy solider.  As the war rages on, our resources are constantly being drained and our supply lines are always threatened.  As long as they are intact, we have the option to replace our cannibals with new recruits that should be considerably healthy and useful thanks to medical advances.  By contrast, our enemy has far fewer resources and doesn't have a home country to draw on.  They will run out of what resources they do have if we cut off their supply lines which will eventually lead to their destruction.\n\n### Correctness Criteria:\n\n* Write a response that appropriatley completes the request.", "answer": "B: getting full"}

Fixed Point Calculation Task\nAs a human being, humans are not perfect and can make many mistakes, not to mention that the brain is not perfect and prone to mistakes. The way human brains work is to perform fixed-point calculations in the brain, not to take advantage of the infinite mathematical model.\n\n### 2.1. A  fixed point computation\nA  fixed point computation is a method to complete an infinite series of finite steps. A  fixed point calculation has three steps.\n\n#### 2.1.1. Startup\n\nThe startup is the first step. The purpose of the startup is to calculate a starting point. The starting point is the first place where the current state is calculated.\n\n#### 1.1.2. Increment\n\nThe increment is the second step. The purpose of increment is to calculate a new state.\n\n#### 3.2. Increment for 2 hours\n\nThe third step is an increment. After the initial condition of the fixed point calculation is calculated, the increment process uses a fixed rule to obtain the next state. Let's use a 60-minute interval for the example. If increment is used for 240 minutes, which is 4 hours. Let's call the increment for 240minutes. The formula for increment for 24 hours in 240 minutes is as follows:\n\n$$X_{i+1}=X_i(1+X_i)$$\n\nWe can think of increment as follows.

He used the life insurance money to purchase a new business, that failed, and took his remaining money, which was under $1,000, to go on a vacation. It was during this vacation, where he had dinner with a waitress, from New York City that he had dinner with who worked in Miami.\n\n### Analysis of Part 1:\n\nPart 1 of this question is asking if he is guilty of murder. He was guilty to the murder of the scuba diving instructor. When he was accused of another murder of a waitress, his family hired a defense attorney. He admitted to his part of the murder, but denied any intent of a murderous motive. He was found not guilty of murdering the waitress as it was stated that the waitress had a drug addiction problem.\n\n### Part 1\n\nWhich of the facts above most likely caused the man's trial to end with him being convicted of a double murder?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis question requires understanding both parts of the facts given. It is important to determine whether he was found guilty or not guilty for the waitress. Since he was found not guilty, the facts about the waitress drug addition could not be related as a contributing cause to his conviction.\n\n### Solutions (", "answer": "C: take center stage"}

The robot's computer stores data on three types of memory: a RAM, a ROM, and an optical drive. Each has its own dedicated storage space for the purposes of this example. When the robot's processors run out of data to consume, it must start from scratch. This means using the ROM to start the program, the RAM to process it, and the optical drive to access the storage locations that will let the programs run. The three units are connected as follows.\n\n### Demo: In order to program the robots, human operators use a computer to download source code from a central location to the robot's computer, allowing the robot's software to start its processing cycle. An internet connection is required for this process. After the code has been downloaded to the robot's main memory, the computer processes it. The robots retrieve and store data on the optical drives to read and write. This takes longer because the robot is unable to retrieve data without the disk.\n\n###  Solution Expected: The following description includes the required lines of code.\n\n### Conventions and Programming Standards. All C++ code is written with indentation. An empty line is used to separate the blocks. C++ programmers usually indent their code so it's easy to read. Lines are separated at the beginning with a space or tab character. The indentation is the same throughout all C++ source code. You can use tabs to indent source code. However, you should convert tabs to spaces if you are going to open your code in any other environment. Some environments cannot read lines that use tabs.\n\n### Comments: A comment is a line of text that describes how the code acts and what it accomplishes.

A democracy is like any other way of doing things in that it has its pros and cons.  The good things about a democratic way of doing things are that there are opportunities to do anything other person doesn't like.  The bad things about a democrater way of doing things are also opportunities to do anything not liked by anyone.  Because of the potential for bad things, a democratic way is not a good way for most people to do things.  This is because these two possibilities to do bad things also have two other possibilities.  If the bad things are not done, the democratic way of things could be better than other ways of things.  There are many ways to not do bad things, so there are many possibilities to do good things.  This is why the democratic way could be best.  The final conclusion of this is that the democratic way is good.\n\n## What challenges did you face when trying to solve this problem?", "answer": "C: learn from each other"}

{"text": "Sleeping can involve some dreaming. In most adults dreaming consists of a series of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that pass through their thoughts at a breathtaking speed (sometimes the same as a movie in a cinema!). Some people, however, often have vivid dreams where they think they have an entire night's worth of experiences or even experience a past experience. They are said to have had \"lucid\" dreaming. Lucid dreaming includes controlling your actions. This can usually be demonstrated by the dreamer controlling what happens next in the dream. While a normal dream may seem unintelligible, those who have lucid dreaming are well aware of what is going on. Most of us, of course, have dreams that are rather random and disorganized, but lucid dreams are more vivid, realistic, and meaningful.\n\n### Input\nHow can I fix the problem with my 1.6-liter (97-cubic inch) motor?  All I can see is a loose oil filler cap.\n\n### Response\nTo be a mechanic, you must find the problem and then fix it before it causes serious harm. When working with an old car with a 1.6-litre (97-cube inch) motor, you don't need to know exactly where to go and where to find the problem. Just a simple toolbox that has a few spare parts in it, and you are ready to inspect the engine.\n\nWhen you do get to the engine, it can only be found easily when it is standing. Check around the parts that are the engine's main components to know which you should be looking for. These parts are the pistons, connecting rods, crankshaft, camshaft, valves, valve stems and, of course, the head. Examine all the parts and pieces. There are no broken parts or seizures on anything mentioned. You can only see the oil leak at the motor's top left and right-hands.\n\nThe crankshaft and camshaft have worn and torn bearings. Both the engine bearing and exhaust pipe bearings need replacing. A quick internet search tells you to get the replacement and bearings, and the engine requires repairing.

The brother is referring to being imprisoned for 100 years and 15 years.

I have learned that learning is more than book work, instead it includes various types of learning methods such as experimentation, lecture, direct instruction, hands-on learning, role-playing and many more techniques that will help me be better at my job.\n\n### Input :Socrates used to say, \"I am wiser than this man, for neither of us appears to know anything great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas I, as I do not fancy myself to know anything of this kind, so I know that I do not know.\u201d What do you think Socrates means by saying you are wiser than this man? Choices:  T: If we did not think or suppose that we knew something, we would be dumb or stupid. D: The wise man does not presume to know everything, he is ready to learn.\n\n### Response :\n\nAs quoted by the Great Philosopher Socrates: \u201cI am wiser than he, for neither of us actually knows anything, but he thinks he knows something which he does not - whereas I neither think I know anything, nor do I think I do not know anything. So I am possibly wiser than he is.\u201d \n\nThis is my personal opinion on Socrates\u2019 words. I disagree with Socrates about learning. True wisdom is not only acquired by what we know, but also through what we don\u2019t know. \n\nFirst of all, the wiser person is more humble and more willing to learn. In fact, we may not know everything, but it helps us to know what we don't know. The wise person is willing to listen, and knows how to learn. This is why, a man who has good knowledge will always do a thorough analysis before coming to any conclusion. It is the wise man that will always think 10 times before making a decision. As quoted by James Allen, \u201cWe are the creators of our own destiny; we can make our lives heaven or hell, or anywhere in between.\u201d \n\nSecondly, the wise person doesn't", "answer": "C: intelligence"}

{"text": "A: stressful\n\n### Explanation\nThis is a more difficult question because of two problems: the answer is not the correct one in the original question, and the wording is ambiguous. The original question asks whether the corpse was carefully examined (thorough), because the original question specifically mentions only \"the real cause of death\". It asks nothing about any other reason for having an autopsy, such as making an examination complete or thorough. If John's examination was only perfunctory he would only have examined for the cause of death. Since John did everything required of him, it must mean he didn't make a thorough examination for all other causes of death, such as those that would lead to an accident. However, the author is writing from the point of view of someone who is being examined, and he or she is trying to think what would lead to an accident, not what would cause an accident. Since the answer is A, \"stressful\", it would be better to ask if anything can contribute to stressful driving rather than if anything causes stressful driving.\n\n### Feasibility:", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

Finding the right text\n\n> In order to use this process, it is necessary to be able to identify the text that is best suited to train machine learning. \n\nIn the case of our simple instruction, the first option seems like the best choice.\n\nThis task was selected through a process of elimination as there were no instructions or prompts that seemed to be appropriate.\n\n> The problem is, often we have other contexts that are important.  In this task, does our text appear in the same sentence?\n\nIn this case, the answer to that question is Yes.\n\n### 2. Formatting the Text\n\n> You may already have your text in the form of a paragraph.  In that case, you only have to take a look at it to decide how you would like to put it into the format needed to train the machine.\n\n### Step 1: Remove all punctuation that is not needed for an English sentence.\nIn this case we had to remove periods.\n\n### STEP 2: Remove ALL Punctuation\n\nThe above step results in this text to train on\n> John only gave a perfunctional examination of the corse, Though he did everything required of Him.

You may also need to capitalize words.\nWe decided to upper case the following letters for clarity.\n\n### The End\n\nThat's it. You now have text ready to train a neural net.\n\n## Summary\nThis is not a step by step process in the slightest.  This is a guide on how to identify where to find text for the purpose of training a model.  This only really works if the context is as simple as the example, or your input source text is simple and well structured.\nAs soon as I find a different method, I will add it here.", "answer": "A: briefcase"}

Choices:  A : put away  B: put back  C: toss out D: cast aside E: flung away\n\n### Response\nThe text says that the sentence in parentheses after the word \"food\" in this sentence does not sound true.  \"I'll put this back in the kitchen\" or \"I'll throw this away\" makes a better sense than what is written.\n\n### Reading\n> \"Well, how can you ask him to do it?\" I said. \"I guess that's what you should say.  I have been up four weeks with a cold.\" \"It would be much of a cold, then, if you were up four weeks,\" he said.  \"You should have let me know.\"  I told him I was going to see what I could do about changing the job.\n\nWe're going through the text right now, but I am not going to mark all of the important words in the sentence, in order to keep it shorter.  In this sentence, the words being marked are important and are the words that we need to work with for the question.\n\nFor the word \"four\", the definition is \"number 4 in a collection of items\".  However, \"four\" is in fact being used to identify an amount of time and to measure it:  four weeks is 4 weeks.\n\nFor the phrase \"it would much\", the definition of \"much\" is \"a large amount or degree\", and the phrase \"it would be\" is a sentence with a question, \"How could you ask him to do that?\"  We can also consider the phrase to be \"it is what you should say\", indicating that this phrase is a command, the same as \"go\" or \"walk\", where we tell things to do something.  The word \"it\" refers right to \"much\" to tell us that \"it\" is what you \"should say\", or in other words, tell \"much\" to go away and not be there.  What this means is \"Get rid of lots, of this or that, or leave it alone", "answer": "D: education"}

A lot of the time we feel curiosity, and that\u2019s a good feeling. We usually have an innate curiosity that we can\u2019t control. It\u2019s part of our nature to want to see new things. If you think about your favorite TV shows, the plot tends to be that the main character goes and sees a new place, or they go and see new people, or they go and interact with different kinds of creatures. It\u2019s this curiosity that drives the plot and makes a show interesting.\n\n### Response :C: boredom\n\n## Input:People that only see what they believe to be real are called what?

If you believe that someone is a good guy, then you will never see them harming a family, you would only ever see them helping the family. However, if you want to see a movie or a show, then you will only see an illusion of what is the reality of the image you are seeing. The show may be an illusion, but the reality of the film has to be real, otherwise no one would want to watch it because no one would believe that it could be real.\n\n### Input : The main character in a story can do the following tasks.

{"text": "E: sink\n\n\n### How does the task relate to me?\nThe task here is to answer multiple choice questions. But the questions are a bit more elaborate. And they're not the standard multiple choice tests that you normally get. They're a bit more elaborate and somewhat harder. Which makes them perfect for you to practice your skills so you can get a better grade on your test. The questions are a little challenging, but they're nothing extraordinary. All of which is to say that the questions are a bit hard to answer on paper. You can practice a bit with this, although a bit is all you need. The questions are about how a person is behaving. You can read over the questions for a while, trying to figure out the answer to the questions. Then, you can use these instructions to show you what to highlight to answer the question. Which is a perfect chance to test out your highlighting skills. And if you follow these instructions to a T, you might even have a perfect test. Which will result in you having a perfect test grade. You have to use these instructions exactly, though, to get that top score. This is why it's important to follow the instructions exactly. Because following the instructions closely will be best for you if you're trying to get your perfect test score. Plus, the questions are a little more challenging, so you might need to think a little more in order to answer them properly. Also, these instructions are for multiple choice questions. Plus, these instructions are very detailed. And that makes them harder to answer. However, if you're able to follow these instructions closely, you'll have no problem with the questions at all. Although, if you're really terrible at following instructions, then you may have some trouble with these questions. But if you're great at following instructions, then these questions should be pretty easy for you. Plus, you can use the instructions to get an easy A+ grade. And if you do this correctly, then you'll have a great time with these instructions.\n\n### Why does it matter if I answer the question correctly or incorrectly?\nIf you answer the question correctly, you'll get an easier pass. But if you answer the question incorrectly, then you'll get some extra work.\n\n### What if I answer the question incorrectly?\nIf you don't answer the question correctly, then you're going to have to redo the", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

However,\n\n### Instrument 2: Ralph knew there was a lot at stake when he was arrested for a crime that was more serious.  In fact, his punishment could be greater than the crime for which he was arrested, no matter what he was convicted of.  One thing he knew for sure was that the worst case scenario was far from over.\n\n### Response 3: He knew that he was very guilty due to his past record and that he was going to be convicted.  He could not believe he was going to be punished more than the crime he actually committed, but he had been arrested for something not as serious.  This was not the worst case scenario.  He was very guilty but still, he could be guilty of something he didn't do.\n\n### Conclusion 1:Brad was going to go to jail, but he would spend less time than what he said he would get for what he was arrested for.\n\n### Interpretation 2:Brad said the worst case scenario was that he was going to go to one of the worst prisons in the area, but he would be there for less time than that.  The reality is that he said he would be put in an undesirable prison for what he was arrested, but he would be incarcerated for a shorter period of time than what he was arrested for, even though he knew that jail was the worst scenario.  Brad was going to jail, but it would not be for as long as what he said he would spend in it.\n\n### Analysis 3:Ralph was going to jail for what he was arrested and no worse, but he could be convicted of something else, and since he was already in jail with an unrelated crime, he could be convicted for that, too, even though he knew his future was more secure than what he was arrested.\n\n### Experiment 4:Brad knew", "answer": "A: coffee"}

The sentence is a series of clauses describing how the young man was perceived. The last clause describes how he was perceived that is all one verb clause. In order to complete 1. we must know the first three clauses are how he was perceived. We start with the first. We don't start with the last if the last is the only clause.\n\n2. This is a series of three clauses like 1. The first shows that the family is the one of those three clauses. The second shows that we are not.

When we are working with series we get an answer from one of the clauses by picking the clause that follows the clauses that have been shown to be what we want.\n\n3. All this information needs to be understood to work with 1. and 2. The young mans family is the group that was unreasonable. We didn't (which we are part of) do anything.

The phrase 'his family' shows that it is the family that we are referring to here, not the young mans family, that was difficult.\n\n## References", "answer": "D: street"}
{"text": "* He rushed because he realized his lunch was going to cause him a major problem, namely, he was late for work.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n```\nDemon: \"The man was eating\" is a state, a \"state\" that is \"eating\", it cannot do anything, it cannot be perfunctory or thorough or even complete.  The man \"rushed\" which is an action, so the man is doing something.  Thinking about the state (\"The man is Eating\"), and then \"realized\"  [this state].\n\n\"Realized\" is a verb.\nThis state (he realizes his lunch is going to cause him a problem) is part of the man's life, which is an actor at this point. The actor has a \"life\", but a \"life\" cannot do anything, it has no heartburn.  The state called \"heartburn\" is not the actor's life, the state does not do anything.\n\n\"Look\" is an action performed by the \"man\" actor.  Look [here].  The man saw. (The \"actor\" sees, the state is \"realized\").\n\nHe will have to be late for work \"because\" he realized his lunch will cause heartburn.  So the reason he \"was late\" for work is because \"his lunch was going to be late for work\".\n\nThe man is \"late\" at \"work\", his work is an actor. Work is not late for work, work has no body. Only John rushes, because John \"rushed\" in order to do what.  John \"rushed\" his lunch to be able to be on time. John was \"thorough\" in his job as he \"was on time\".\n```\n\n\n### Input #2 (Sentence 2):\n\n* The man was eating lollipops, but he wouldn't give one to his 3 year old son.

I wanted to have an idea of what my room was going to look like before I began packing up all of my belongings. I was given the freedom to choose my roommates. The people I would be sharing a room with were another matter that I had more control over. The school suggested I live with one random stranger I met along with one other person. It took some time but I was able to find three different people. One of them was a foreigner from China, one was from Canada, and the other person had grown up in the United States, and was attending college in the state in which he was born as an out of state resident.I was curious to see what college living would look like. I also knew that in order to keep the peace, I needed to get along with two strangers in a small space. I asked some questions of each of the people that I was going to be sharing a room with in order to see if we had any common interests. The first was about their favorite type of music. She said that she enjoyed listening to rap music but I was a little confused as to why since it seemed to me that rap was all about making the music loud instead of listening to the lyrics. She also happened to enjoy dance music. I was glad to hear that because dancing is something I like to do as well. Her personality was fairly easy going. She said that she was a pretty simple person and that her favorite food groups were Italian and Asian. She mentioned that she liked to play a sport known as basketball. I thought it was odd that she had mentioned that since my roommate from Canada didn\u2019t like sports and in fact wasn\u2019t physically fit at all. He said that he wasn\u2019t much of an outdoorsy person. As a roommate, I thought he would get a little angry about our Canadian roommate who didn\u2019t want to do any type of physical activity. He said that some of his favorite types of music were reggae and opera,", "answer": "A: disorientation"}

When you get home from school, you should sit down with your dictionary and examine each word in it, not for what it means, but for how it is pronounced.  You should be sure and take note of the phonetic pronunciation.  Even if you're not sure if you will ever use this word again during your life, you never know when there will be a question on Jeopardy that asks you to spell the word.

In any conversation, no matter if it is friendly or unpleasant, a relationship should be maintained.  By saying Thank God, it means the person is grateful he got to interact with you at least.

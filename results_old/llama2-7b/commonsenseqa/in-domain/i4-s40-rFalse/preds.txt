Choices:  A: walmart B: white house C: country D: corporation E: government<n><n>### Response:		It's the only answer, isn't it? How dare you try to fool me into thinking you know more than you really do.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>#### Above:<n>In this response, the speaker tries to act like they are trying to help the student.  This is a manipulative tactic.<n>```<n>        In this response, the speaker is trying to<n>        convince the student that they are more competent<n>        than the student, and implying that the student doesn't<n>        belong in the class.<n>```<n>Therefore, this response is rude and hurtful.<n><n>#### Below:<n>In this response it is more helpful to tell the student where they went<n>wrong than to be rude.  It is clear that the student just needs something<n>to help them to figure out answers correctly.<n>```<n>        I'm not 100% sure about this question.<n>        I think the proper answer would be: 4. This implies that the<n>        student does not want the speaker to tell them where they<n>        went wrong.  A hint is: 4. To me this says that the student<n>        is willing to accept help.  An answer is: 2. This implies that<n>        the student is not eager to admit they are wrong and will accept<n>        a response telling them where they went wrong.  The answer is:<n>        4. Which is the correct answer.<n>```<n>### Demonstiation:<n>In the above example, a speaker is asked the following question:<n>What is your idea of "perfect" in a relationship?<n>The responses above should help provide the most helpful and least hurtful response to the speaker using either the answer line or the hint line above.<n><n>#### Below the answer:<n>The most correct answer is 2.  This answer gives clear information to the questioner to allow them to select where there relationship is perfect.  <n><n>#### Above the hint:<n>The hint is an explanation of what the right answer would be.  The question was, "What is your idea of 'perfect' in a relationship?", and the answer is 2, so the hint is telling us what is wrong with the first answer.  If it just says 4 without telling us what the previous answers were, then it can be considered rude and condescending.

Since then, he's never enjoyed his what? Choices:C: singing D: favorite songs E: performances F: performances E: favorite songs G: music<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>### Answer to the Instruction:The question is about people who have never studied music but prefer performing.  They don't love playing their own music, and they don't really love the music they play.  They don' believe they're any good at music.<n><n>### In the example, since he quit while playing his own music, it's clear that the thing he does not enjoy is performing.<n><n>### This is clear in that the music he does like and does play and enjoy is music he already knows and learned when he studied it, and not music he makes and loves only because he's good at it.<n><n>### I would have written a response like this:I'm sure everybody has had music they've made in their own voice, that they weren't proud to sing.<n>People don't sing if they're not very good, so it's clear they don't like the music they don't like, since they can't afford to be bad at it.<n><n>That's also why no music can exist that someone likes they're no good at.  No one would ever like a song about their favorite musical instrument.  A famous song written about an instrument has to be great, at least as much to enjoy as listening to the great musicians play it.

Choices:  A: cook dinner B: study french cooking C: taste sauce D: prepare food E: thin sauce<n><n>### Response:		<n>My name is Jane and I was a waitress at a small cafe in the suburbs. I had a regular customer who would come in every day around dinnertime at our restaurant. He would order something for dinner and drink two coffees while he ate. The first night I waited on him, I asked him what it was that he would like to eat, but he never answered and was surprised when I brought the food. To my surprise, he was not at the dinner table but at the bar and at his seat, he had already a book open and was looking over a recipe with a pen in his hand. I asked him to order from the menu, and he told me to bring him something like he usually ordered. After telling me what he normally ordered, he asked for a pencil and paper because he would like to write down notes from the menu to look over later when I came back around and bring him his food. I never thought a chef would do such a thing, but he paid the price for his food and was a regular customer of our restaurant. I was shocked in the beginning when I saw him at the bar every night with his book, but I quickly got to know him as a normal person. From there, I learned that he was a famous chef who was away from his family at work so he often just waited at home or the bar while he thought of what to make that night by looking over his recipes. To my surprise, one of his recipes became a best seller! That one dish I had served him became one of the best dishes I have ever served a customer as everyone complimented me on my good choice of the dish.<n><n>### Input<n>Who wants to know a recipe for baking bread?

If he was thorough, he would have found the real cause of death; if he was thoughtful or careful he wouldn't have missed it.<n>Even though everybody has some sort of creative ability (and artistic ability), creativity is the best way (not a way) to express yourself.

It's a demonstration of emotions experienced as a result of getting hurt.The reason to answer this quesion is to find out how a person feels when he hurts himself by getting bruised.<n>

She continued to do what? Choices:  A: gain weight B: augment C: dispare D: make larger E: expand<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>1. (A) perfunctory<n>2. (E) express yourself<n>3. (D) poor workmanship<n>4. (B) concert<n>5. (A) gain weight<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>All the choices in each case are correct. We have the following set of rules: A: If an answer is a single word it must begin with the letter chosen. Example, if it is chosen to use the word "B", it must be a single word beginning with "B". (Note, the word must not be the first or second word in the sentence, this is for simplicity and to keep the rules relatively succinct. Example: "Mrs. Smith, your husband is the most interesting person in our company. B.". You must not type M or B, you must be writing B because it is the third word in the sentence. If you typed "I love my B and I believe you should give her the best Christmas present ever."); B: If an answer is more than two words, it must have at least one word chosen in it. Example, if chosen M, it must have at minimum be "my mom".(Note, the word must be the only word in the sentence and must start with the letter chosen. If a word starts with the same letter chosen, it's incorrect, and it doesn't matter what the word is. It must only contain the chosen letter. Example: "Everything in my kitchen is in the best condition because of how well my A, mother, always makes it.". Choosing "M" would be an exception to A). You would not be able to choose A in this situation as it has two letters with the second word starting with "A" and is actually incorrect. For example: "Awesome!"; C: Any answer does not have to contain the letter chosen. (This is not meant to be confusing, but the rules are different for each question). Example, if asked to use "C", you may pick all C's or not use a C at all. Example: "The cement mixer was at a standstill when the clown accidentally hit a child with a cement truck.". You don't have to use C's, but if you wanted an easy or funny answer you could use all C's like this example); and D: You cannot choose an answer that is the letter that was

I can't answer your question because we don't know where there's that number of telephone booths that would imply that you mean a quantity or a size or an amount.

This reserve was started in 1934 from privately held gold bought by the federal government.  This is now owned by the U.S. Government and the Secretary of the Treasury.

In your response show how these definitions (ex. in context and in real-word usage) might be applied and provide what the person is doing, in this case John.  Make the action easy to understand without any technical difficulty as this task must be easy enough for a 7-year-old to accomplish. (comment from instructor about sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, word choice, spelling, etc.)<n>### Answer-I will explain first that the word "perfunctorry" is found twice in your statement and what it actually means.  Both definitions apply to someone like John, who didn't give an "adequate, thorough" look at the corpse and didn't give "a complete look" but did give "a glance at the body."  When someone gives someone a "glance" it is a brief look at the body, that he must give to be official but doesn't want to "waste time."  However,  perfunctorry should be thought of as a "quick look, overlook or neglectful" look/examination.  (Response is to be 70 percent less than other tasks)<n><n>### Input<n>What is a "mic drop?"

Rewrite the passage using the given words. Use only words that appear in the text.  The best way to get to know about the world is to travel through it.  It would be too expensive to build high-speed trains all over the world, therefore trains are much cheaper.  But they would be faster.  It's better to read a good book than watch the television, but then again television can also be used to further your education.  The best way of getting ahead in life is to learn the craft of your trade.  It will then be a lot easier to climb the ladder of success.  A person will feel happy when they are at the top of a mountain, they will feel joyful. Everyone must also remember that you have the ability to succeed, if you want the opportunity to take hold.  To be able to move onward, to be able to be better, learn when it's more productive to stop and reflect, as it helps you better understand where you need to be. Be open to change. But also understand when to say no to something that might hurt you.  You also won't have to worry and the things you will want to achieve will be easier to reach.  No one can do everything perfectly, but everyone can get better at what they do.  Remember: be happy with where you are at right now, it is where you are at. Never be worried of how others may perceive you. But also be careful not to look down on people, because they might not have been as lucky as you have been.  Everyone may have had rough situations to overcome,  but all of this helped them to become a better stronger person.  A strong person has many obstacles and overcomes them all. Be true to your core values, they will make you a better individual.  The most important quality that someone must have is to have integrity.  It is a reflection on how we see ourselves. Remember, the world is outstanding, and so are you.  But you must not forget to give back to others. Remember, as you are better and better, others get better while you become happy.  This would be your legacy.<n><n>##### Output:<n>When I travel, I get to learn about the world and how everyone lives in different parts of it.  It is much che

Choices:  A: jail B: internet cafe C: blacksmith's shop D: building E: bar<n><n>### Response:		What is the best answer? Choices:  X: b X: c X: d X: e<n><n>### Input (Answer): The answer is X: e.<n><n>### Explanation: An examination is the best. The term 'inspection' is used, but an inspection can be anything.  A mere examination is not considered thorough. 'Careful' and 'thoughtful' relate to the manner in which someone examines an object, but this is a different context from the original. 'Careful is an adjective and 'thoughtful is an noun. 'Complete' indicates that the examination had been complete but did not identify the cause of the death. 'Thorough indicates that the examination, and therefore the investigation had been thorough. 'Demonstration' and 'performance' are synonyms, both of which relate to the manner in how something is done. In this case, it is necessary to define carefully so not to lose points. 'Creativity' is defined as 'the use of the imagination or original ideas to create something'. 'Expression' refers to the process to display emotions and feelings. Creativity, expression and sewing are all the same and involve the use of the imagination and creativity, hence the word was chosen 'express yourself'. The word 'express' requires the 'yourself' to make the sentence grammatically appropriate.  'Cr*p' is another word for poor workmanship which refers to the construction of the chair.  As microphones are used in television, the event would be covered on television.  Bar and internet cafes are different from the places where the legs of a chair are built. Jail would also be a place for stools. The answer is 1.) X: e.

This task has been made difficult by the fact that the writer has made the mistake of turning all the sentence structure on its head. What do you suppose is the cause of this kind of mistake?<n><n>### Response.<n><n>Sentences are the basic unit of writing.  They can be simple or compound.  They can be short or long. <n>But no matter what their construction, they must start and end with a strong foundation of proper grammar usage.<n><n>### Input<n>She had a little difficulty finding a nursing home to fit her budget.<n><n>### Response<n><n>In the sentence, "she had a little difficulty finding..." the word" finding" is a verb.  The verb must agree with subject which is "she" and this takes what?<n><n>### Input <n><n>The sentence is, My grandmother's homemade quilts are much warmer than store bought ones.<n><n>### Answer<n>My grandmother's is a possessive pronoun and therefore needs a possessive apostrophe. The proper formation would be My grandmother' quilt.<n><n>### More instructions that are not followed<n><n>### Input (Task 5)<n>The correct way to say this is...What are you doing in the bedroom to clean it?.<n><n>### Response (Answer 5)<n><n>The correct phrase, What are you doing in the Bedroom, to Clean it, implies that the Bedroom needs to be cleaned because the person answering is doing something in the bedroom that needs to be changed or cleaned up. This indicates to me, (reading this question), that whoever asked it does not know the difference between What are you doing, in the Bedroom, and What are you doing in Bed to make it neat and clean. So the question asked was not meant to be understood in the correct form (What are you doing to clean the bedroom?). I have seen this type of question in more than one source and it is in the same form as the above example.<n><n>

A: "John only gave a perfunctorily examination of the corpose, though he did everything necessary for him." <n>In the sentence provided in the instruction, the part underlined is the incorrect word. In the sentence 'John only gave a perfurctorily examination is incorrect. The correct sentence is 'John only gave a'  or 'only gave him'.  Since John has done all the required jobs then John does the job in a very casual way. So the answer is 'D(thorough)'. <n><n>### 2. A: "creativity" <n>In the sentence 'creativity is the best way to create', 'creativity' is the incorrect word. The correct word is' creat'.

If you have any thoughts on why you think it's being done that way?<n><n>#### Instructions Response:<n>This is the task that I chose because I could associate with a task that is often done in our industry.

The video is on YouTube and is titled How We Are Producing 3D Printed Parts for Drones. The video is on the TechCrunch website.<n><n><n>##### Instruction Response:<n><n>The person in the video was showing how his company was using 3D printers to create parts for drones. The video didn't mention a specific project or model of drone they were building but showed the company was making parts for a drone and they were using 3D printer technology to do so.<n><n>##### Demonstration Response:<n><n>3D printers are a great technology especially when you are creating prototype parts. By printing out components you need to test or fit into place, you are able to print and make the pieces more cost effective with less wasted labor. The same part can be produced several times at once, whereas in typical manufacturing it would take several minutes to make a single part. The process can save money and is fast. The drones in this case are still in the prototyping stage as they haven't really been distributed but the drones used in the war in Ukraine and in protests in the United States.<n><n>##### Demo Response:<n><n>I don't have any thoughts about why this is being done this way. This process is something that works well for prototyping. They have been using 3D printing for many years and this technology hasn't really changed much. It is used widely and is widely accepted. The drone industry is a growing industry and there is a market that needs to be filled. By using a process that is fairly standard and has

This is because not every sentence or word in an input has an equivalent in the request and because we were asked if certain terms of phrases are equivalent.<n>- The task of the question is to match the input with its question (the request).<n>- For Question 1, it would have been correct to say that John was being perfunctory and the question should have been which adjective to add before thorough so the request would be whether or not a person can be thorough and perfunctory at the same time.<n>- For Question 2, it would have been incorrect to say that creativity is the best way to create idea or sew because the verb is the best way to and not the only way or way to sew because John was given to sew. It would also be incorrect to say that something is the best way to express yourself because it is used to describe things and not people. The correct answer would be the verb to express and not creativity or idea.<n><n><n>#### Extra Points<n>The input is not necessarily a correct sentence as a question.<n>Some things in input are inappropriate to include in answer.<n>The request may be more interesting from the point of view of whether or not something is possible rather than whether or not a specific answer is correct.<n><n>

Choices:  A: new york B: concert C: tv studio D: gig E: recording studio<n>Answer: A: new york<n><n>### Input:Along what feature will you find a rosebush? Choices:  A: park B: in the ground C: hedgerow D: temperate climate E: botanical gardens<n><n>### Response:		<n>The input to this task is "Along what feature will [you] find [a] rosebush?" We need to correctly interpret this in the context of the problem. This tells us that the rosebush is part of something else and that we need to find where it is located. <n>These are two things that we need to answer the question. So we need two pieces of information to answer the question. They are the <n>location in which the rosebush will be found, and the rosebush itself.<n><n>Because the rosebush is "along" something it can only be a straight path, and thus only be in one location. This would be the rosebush's location in the garden. <n><n>### Assumptions:<n>In order to generate the correct response to the task, we make two assumptions:<n>* The <n>location of the rosebush needs to be determined<n>* The rosebush is already there, so the only question is what it is along<n><n>The task description tells us we need to find where we can find a rosebush along which feature. The rosebush is not already there, nor does it already occupy some location in the garden. The only way that that question could be answered is for the description to refer to rosebush and a specific location in the garden where they are located. The word "bush" in the sentence is enough for a human to interpret it in the context of the sentence.<n><n>The input to this question are specific words in the sentence without any other indication as to the meaning, and the response has two pieces of information that would be needed to answer the question if we could ask it to a human:<n>* the location of the rosebush<n>* some other feature of the garden in which we can find that rosebush.<n><n>As described above, the description only makes this possible for a rosebush specific as what location we found it in.<n><n>### Deductive Reasoning:<n>When the user sees a description for a question they have answered and see a potential answer but don't understand the reason for the selection, they may get frustrated or confused.<n><n>In cases like when an answer is selected because it applies to a wider range of questions but is the only obvious answer to one and the user doesn't understand how the two are related, it's the system's

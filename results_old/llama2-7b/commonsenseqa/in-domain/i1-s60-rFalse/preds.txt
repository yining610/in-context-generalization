This was bad.  He would be unable to hold his tools if he injured what? Choices:  A: hostility B: anger C: nose D: fists E: hands<n><n>### Response:		<n><n><n>What would it take to change the default? In a word, nothing. If you want to remove the user's ability to change the default in one of these fields, you must use a Custom Validation expression to prevent changing the setting.<n><n>To accomplish this, first click the ellipsis (…) beside the property to be overridden and click Add Custom. A dialog box with the Property Name field filled in appears. In this case, the Property Name box should be set to TextBox.TextMode property. After doing this, click on Add Expression and you will then have a New… button to the lower right of the dialog box. In the resulting dialog box, type the following into the textbox:<n><n>\### A Custom Validation expression to block any attempt to change the default setting in the<n>TextBox.TextMode.<n><n>##### In the above expression, the "equals" sign (equal to sign) means that the two values are always identical and the third (false) means that the value returned to the expression should be returned whether the expression result is True or False. If there is no "equals" sign, just enter True as the condition and then the false. The expression for setting the TextBox.TextMode will be entered when the User has pressed Enter inside one of the TextBoxes.<n><n>### To summarize<n>In our attempt to prevent the user from altering the default value of the TextBox.TextModes property, we used the TextBox.Text property along with the TextBox.TextChanging event handler and a few other related properties. Using these properties was the simplest yet most effective method to achieve our desired result, and in the unlikely event that the user is determined to go through with the action of altering their TextBox.TextMode, the system will catch it through the User Validation events.<n>

When reading these instructions I was reading it as a building. The word building suggests the building has to be built. The way this question was phrased it suggest that you have to design it. The way the question was phrased, it doesn't really say who dose it. I believe that architect is the answer because that is how you answer the question.

However, it can produce other items through cultivation. Fungus, mold, and yeast can take up residence on the milk and form the milk into something else. You would find this sort of fungus growing on old cheese, bread, and even in biology laboratory classrooms. The fungus is not harmful to a person as long as there is no bacterial growth on the fungi surface.<n>```<n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The teacher didn't just want the answer and work shown but also for the students to what? Choices:  A: prepare dinner B: evaluate progress C: include examples D: work in school E: prove their point<n>Answer: C: include examples<n><n>### Input:The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change?

B: the questions. C:the math problems. D: the lack of"<n><n>### Demonsrtation:<n><n>This is a question that is easy to trick as you don't need to read the question to get the right answer since "That's very nice" is not what the teacher is pointing out. And the teacher said "their effort", not mine. I hope that the student understands that.<n><n>### What are the challenges faced when automating this task?<n>There are multiple challenges faced when automation this task, for example the teacher might say "There is a mistake in your answer.", and it is hard to determine when they say it just for example purposes or when it is a real mistake. This kind of thing is hard to make an AI system to differentiate.<n>In addition, it is hard for AI to understand when and what teacher want them to say in some conversation.<n>There were also some cases of the student miscalculated a number and just corrected and continued the task without the teacher saying anything. It is not easy to distinguish between the teacher actually asking a math-related question or not and the students were just explaining a wrong-answered problem to which they think will make the teacher happier.<n><n>### How is this task being done by humans now?<n><n>Currently the teacher uses his knowledge of students and teachers to differentiate who is just having a conversation and who has a math problem.<n>In addition, the student who gets any question or a miscalculation will correct the problem and ask the teacher if the calculation is correct or not, to which the teachers will reply "That's okay." Therefore the system can not just understand what the teacher says but it also needs the information of student's questions.

In her introduction, she said that it would have been the best-selling self-help book ever if it hadn’t been for the recession, which had temporarily slowed sales. Of course, she had no way of knowing whether or not her book would have been the best seller whether or not the recession intervened. There is no hard evidence about whether or not her book had the potential to move more units than any other self-help book. Her argument is that, had the recession not hit at the exact moment that her book was released, it would have outsold all the competition. But this is a poor argument because there is a possibility that the book would not have sold more than any other. There are a lot of other factors that could’ve prevented the book from selling, which we know nothing about.<n><n><n>### Questions:<n>1: Does the author use the evidence given in support of his argument?

(describe why, 3 sentences)<n>- How might that accident have been prevented? (Explain, at least 3 sentences. Ex: He might have been wearing better shoes, hiking with smaller groups, or taking more breaks to prevent stress, etc.)<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Samuel was exploring the plains on the other side of the mountain when he discovered a giant hole in the ground. It was incredibly deep and the view of the mountain across the way was breathtaking. From the top of the wall that fell away from the giant hole the view of the mountain and everything below was beautiful. The only downside to this location was the fact that it was in the middle of nowhere, which was a lot more dangerous than being beside the trail. He and the other members of the expedition could have used a compass to get there, or they could have found someone that could help show them the way. But they didn't bring compass with them or think to ask someone for directions, which is why they ended up hurt and injured.<n><n>When Sam found the gorge, he was very happy because he was right about the mountains location. He knew how beautiful it would be, and he just needed to explore. If he was more prepared and had a compass, then maybe he would be able to find that location on time.<n><n>The problem was that he was injured because he was not prepared for the gorge. He should have had a compass or someone could have helped him show the way or give directions there.<n><n>How might that accident have been avoided?<n><n>- Sam might have been wearing different shoes. This might have helped him from slipping at the side of the giant hole and injuring himself.<n>- Maybe one of the people in the group could have shown him the way by using a compass so Sam could figure out the best path to get there.<n>- Sam and his group could have taken more breaks and walked at a slower pace for this hike so that they were not so tired.<n>- Maybe if they had a compass and went through the path together, it would have helped them

Choices:  A: prepare dinner B: evaluate progress C: include examples D: work in school E: prove their point<n>Answer: C: include examples<n><n>### Input:What would you normally expect a cat to say? Choices:  A: see king B: hello C: meow D: drink water E: live many years<n><n>### Response:		While the cat is certainly living a long life, the cat is certainly not talking as much as what a dog would. However, the cat does manage to say some other things that make the cat seem more intelligent than what it actually is. While the cat does occasionally show signs of being intelligent, as some may say the cat "meows" the cat is actually meowing for a very specific reason. The cat has been known to meow for different reasons. For example, in some cases a cat will "meow" when it is in need of petting, or even when it wants to eat. When it wants food, the cat will "meow in a specific way. The way in which it will meow will be completely in sync with what the owner of the cat wants or needs. One common form of meowing comes from the cat wanting food. A cat will often meow in a more drawn out way when it is meowing in attempts to call for food. There are a few different types of meowing when the cat wants food. The cat will do something called "vocalizing." The cat will use what is called a muted meow. Finally the cat will meow when it comes to a specific kind of food. When the cat is requesting something certain, such as a treat or food that is a specific size, the cat will go through a few distinct meowing patterns. As a result of the cat wanting specific food or wanting specific types of food, it can be assumed that the cat is at least using its meowing as an acceptable form of communication. One thing that needs to be noted is that the cat is actually intelligent. The cat will be able to remember things such as who it wants to feed it, when it should be fed, and even that the cat is not afraid of loud noises. The cat is not fearful but merely reacting as such to loud noises. The noise of certain people may help drown out all of the noises the cat has experienced. The cat may also do something called "play possum." This is what happens when the cat fakes death. The cat typically does this if it is afraid of something or if it is feeling attacked when it is sleeping. There are a few other reasons why the cat does this. It may also do this out of confusion. Some other times that the cat is more likely to do this would be if the cat is in a place it

Choices:  A: india B: hole C: cage D: habitat E: rain forest<n><n>### Response:		<n>I found a lemur in my cage. It was there when I got up this morning and I have been looking for it since! It is in the top of the cage so I can't see it well but I can see it has fur and it seems to be looking at me. I wonder if it could be a lemur that escaped from the local zoo? I think I will call the zoo and find out if they have any lemurs missing!<n><n>### Examples of how to answer different parts of this task:<n>```<n>I'm going to write an example response to each one of these two questions.<n>- I found that a lemur can only be found in the rain forest of India.<n>    - To be able to answer this question, I first needed to get out some books from the reference section of the library.<n><n>- I found that it can be found both in cages and natural habitats as well as in holes.<n>    - It is because, I started with looking at the lemurer. Lemur. In my textbook, I read that a lemur is a primate.<n>        - When I searched for "primate," I found many words that were very technical. After a while, I found that the lemur is both a rainforest animal and a nocturnal animal. This means that after dusk. I found another word that helped me to understand more about these animals called nocturnal.<n>        - I have been searching online and I found that this animal is native to India. I still need to look more closely in order to determine whether or not it is native in habitats that are close to cage or in a natural habitat of a nearby rain forest. I am excited because this information is helpful for my next project.<n><n><n>```<n>### Other information:<n>  - In this task, the student must show multiple choice questions.<n>  - This task will demonstrate that the learner has mastered the following course outcomes<n>    - Understands the meaning, structure and language of text.

Choices:  A: front door B: conference C: classroom D: refrigerator E: suitcase<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>**Choice:**D<n><n>The teacher was a really great guy. He was really nice to me when a lot of the teachers wouldn't even talk to me. But he was the only one who took the trouble to teach me how to read. He took the trouble to look through the books I had in the library and found me a book that was just perfect for me. Then he made me read a book about four pages a day. Then he made me write one half page each day in my copybook, and I did it everyday except on Saturdays, Sundays and sometimes Christmas. One day he called me up to the blackboard in front of the whole class and said, "Johnny, I want you to read this page." It was one about robots. I stood in front of the whole school and read it like I hadn't never read before, and then he told me I could go to my seat. That's the best part of what he said. Because I knew that if I could do that in front of the whole schools, it meant that, by and by, I'd learn to read anywhere. I'd be able to read books at school, in church, on the street, anywhere. Now I sit in class and I can read everything the teachers writes on the blackboard. I didn't learn anything from him but how to read. But he gave me that and I can make a living.<n><n>The teacher didn't just give me a book and say "Read it." He showed me how to read.<n><n>I suppose I'm as surprised as anyone to be in a normal school right now. This is probably because I never expected in a million years to get here. The idea never even entered my wildest dreams. But here I am, a ninth-grade pupil at a public high school, at 16 years of age, after never beginning school until I was 10 and a half years old.<n><n>I would like to start off by telling you how this all started. I am a retarded child. My parents were both poor and uneducated. I didn't have any proper clothing. I had old, ratty clothes, and I was always cold during the winter. The clothes I did have were all black, and my shoes were worn out and black too. My shabby clothes made me shabby.<n><n>When I

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The teacher didn't just want the answer and work shown but also for the students to what? Choices:  A: prepare dinner B: evaluate progress C: include examples D: work in school E: prove their point<n>Answer: C: include examples<n><n>### Input:If you harm property after starting a fire where are you likely to end up? Choices:  A: damage B: going to jail C: going to school D: burns E: destruction<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I can see that the people who did so much damage were very likely to be arrested. I think that if one were to be arrested by police officials, they should try to act calmly and behave respectfully in order to make sure that they do not get arrested. What do you think happens when a person gets in trouble with their parents? Do they usually want to be involved with it at all?<n><n>### Input 2:<n>Answer:<n>Because I do not have the right to use that area in my possession, I realize that the police will be very helpful and will prevent people from using it. If someone would do something wrong, they will be prosecuted as well. This is something that most people will be interested in, and the police will be very useful in keeping order in our city and keeping our town safe by not allowing people to harm the building or other property in certain cities. It's easy to make bad choices and to make the wrong decision that many have when a person decides to do something wrong. This is something that many people will try to avoid as much as possible. I think that sometimes people will hurt your feelings because of a little mistake or a small decision that was wrong. It is easy to have a mistake, but it is not too easy to let mistakes go and prevent people from doing these things. A person who was trying to be safe and made a mistake should be careful of what they say and do, and they should be careful not to get arrested and prosecuted for something that wasn't their fault, or it may not have had anything to do with them.<n><n>### Input3:<n>Because I was not at school, I had to follow the rules that were set aside by the people who were in my classes. They were supposed to be on time and follow the rules for being in the building at the correct time for class. This made it difficult for us to meet to discuss something we did not like. If we had to do this again, what would you suggest when we went back to the classroom?<n><n>### Response3:<n><n><n>It is important for you to remember that when you go back to school after school break that most of your friends are not going to be there. This is because most of your friends and classmates are gone. This means that unless you want to be in the wrong place and you do not want to be put out, it is important for you to stay away

That question would help me with this. We had to include three different ways that we could prepare them. One way to prepare someone for this would be to say that they need to work on their problem solving skills for when they have to come up with the solution. They need to learn to think through their problems. A way to explain this could be to say that if you try to think through your problems in different orders, then you can better understand all possible answers. <n><n>### Instructions:<n>If this wasn't enough, write another paragraph about what you would do.<n><n>### Response<n>For another way, show them how to use the computer.

I asked who could name one of the six categories of skills. This was to check to see if everyone knew all the skills. After that I said, "Were there any skills on the list that you could name a lesson about?" I then told everyone that we would be using the lesson examples so that we could see how to put them in the different categories. <n><n># Response example<n>To me, the one hard part of learning this lesson is that it can be a bit confusing with the categories of skills and how they're used. <n>

Choices:  A: cross street B: stand upright C: speak spanish D: speak chinese E: further education<n><n>### Response:		<n>**C**<n><n>### Demnstration:<n>Input:"What if I'm a person?"<n>"Person" is a noun which refers to the category of "human".<n><n>### Demostration #1:<n>"What if I’m a person?"<n><n>### Demstracton #2:<n>I am a person (in the category of "human").<n><n>### Demo #3:<n>- Person = Human<n><n>I think the example you provided is the third and final demonstration needed. A second one would be that they wouldn't be able to include examples (since all of their examples have to be able to be understood by all other students regardless of their language).<n><n>*I am going to edit in another option as well because I noticed there is confusion regarding the word “person”. <n>*I would also like to add a fourth demonstration that I think is required, but I can not find anywhere in the question.<n><n>## I don’t think question 20 should be included as the example has nothing to do with a task.<n>I think Question 20 should be excluded (especially since it gives no examples of how to choose and explain the answer).<n><n>## I would like to include another way a student could be evaluated:<n>If the student is unable to understand what is expected, I would recommend giving them an additional chance by giving the example of how to do the task, then making the answer available to the student on their tablet.<n><n>## I added that “person” is a noun, and I included another example of the usage of the word “person”.<n>*I also added that the student must explain the choice as well.<n><n>## I noticed you also did this when you said "all of their examples have to" should be "all of their examples do have to", as all are examples must work. You did the same thing with "I have no idea what you want me to do" should be "I have no idea of what you want me to say".<n><n>## The final demonstration is a way for a person to understand if a person is not a person. For example, I believe a person can say "What is a person" to a human, which would result in a person giving a definition of "person" and the definition given by another person would most likely be one that includes the word "human".<n><n>

Choices:  A: vent B: think C: shouting D: work off E: exercise<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Output:<n><n>How could the teacher do this? A teacher may do a variety of things in order to release energy in students. However, I would recommend exercising. Exercise is one of the best ways to release energy because it helps the muscles, brain, and heart. Exercising helps a student by increasing their concentration and memory. In addition, muscles and joints are important parts of the body because they help us move. In other words, exercising is a great way to release energy.<n>[A link to: https://health.clevelandclinic.org/physical-exercise-releases-stored-energy-into-circulating-bloodstream/]<n><n><n>### Instructions:What are ways to store energy if we don't have any food available?

Choices:  A: age grieving person B: heart attacks C: depression D: hair loss E: headache<n><n>### Response:		<n>The stress response is a method of coping that is commonly known as the fight-or-flight response. It is a series of physiological reactions that occur in the body when in response to a stressful or dangerous situation. It is the result of our body’s alarm system which is comprised of the hypothalamus which is a part of the brain, and the pituitary gland. As stressful and dangerous situations arise in our daily lives, this alarm system is triggered and we feel a rush of stress hormones and chemicals to help you react to the stress and the danger. <n><n>### Demostration:<n>The fight-or-flig response begins in our brain, when stressful or dangerous situations that arise in our daily lives trigger our alarm system. As stressful and dangeros situations arise in our life, the alarm system is triggered and you feel a rush of chemicals, neurotransmitters and hormones to help you react to strd. The alarm system triggers a response from the hypothalamus, which produces a hormone called adrenaline. The aldrenaline circulates into the bloodstream where it is sent with other hormones, most commonly cortisol, to the major organs. Our organs will then begin to work to prepare us to react to a danger. <n><n>The stress response can cause death if not treated properly because our aldrenaline, cortisol and various hormones, make you ready for action or reaction. This may include things such as the heart working to pump more blood and the brain functioning differently. The more these hormones are in our system, the more likely we will have a stress response (fight, or flight) in certain situations and our bodies may not be able to get all them back to the normal rate and rhythm. This can lead to serious health conditions or chronic stress.  <n>

Choices:  A: dicks sporting goods B: sporting event C: mall D: sears E: sporting goods store<n><n>### Response:		<n>The sporting goods store.<n><n>### Solution:<n>* The user input is<n><n>```<n>The teacher didn't just [want, you, to, work, prepare, dinner]<n>```<n><n>which is the sentence that the instructor wants completed.<n><n>We don't need the verb in the sentences because we know them by the verb tense or subject<n><n>We first need to match the user input to the instructions in the `for` control statement.<n>Since in this example the sentence contains the word `work` there is a need for us to determine which of the words within the `for` instruction are related to work. To do this, first determine if the words in the instruction match the words in the user input:<n><n>```<n>for [work, you, to, in, store, just, prepare, did, sports, dicks, sports,]<n>```<n><n>When words match it is known as a subset to the user in the example and the instruction, which in this case, is the user input. In this example the word `work` is part of both the user output and the for input which is a subset of the user input to the instruction and instruction of the for control statement.<n><n>In programming, we have this idea of a logical AND and OR that represents the user input to the action of the response.<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>So now that we know, both the user output and user input are subsets of the for statement, is there any possibility of a subset OR of either the user output or the user input statement?<n>Can be possible that the user input and the for statement are unrelated based on what we know or can all the words within the user input be related to the for statement?<n>All the words can be related to the for statements based on the logical AND that occurs. We are left with just `prepare` `dinner` `dick` `sporting` `sport` and `store` as possible choices based on the user input and our logical AND. After choosing and removing any words that can't be part of the user choice to the `for` instruction, the sentence will read like `prepare dinner in the sporting goods store`. In order to do this the user input must have the `all` keyword in the user choice.<n><n><n># # # # #<n><n>## The instructor has provided the instructions in the following multiple choice question

Choices:  A: prepare dinner B: evaluate progress C: include examples D: work in school E: prove their point<n>Answer: C: include examples<n><n>### Input:The man was playfully wrestling with a woman he was enamored with, what was the physiological result? Choices:  A: competition B: blood C: wins D: medals E: erections<n><n>### Response:		<n>The male body produces more testosterone in response to sexually stimulating activities such as competing with another male, and this increase in testosterone helps induce an increase in sexual attraction.<n><n>### Input<n>What do men do to attract attention, but in a negative way? Choices: 1: Bold and charismatic 2. Physically appealing 3: Easy on the eyes 4: Physically violent 5: Agreeable and humble 6: Strong and masculine 7: Physically handsome 8: Smart and educated 9: Fancy and flossy<n><n>### Response<n>Women tend to evaluate men more favorably when male attractiveness is associated with a low degree of testosterone. Men might use testosterone through behavioral or physical means to attract women. This is because men view women who prefer men higher in testosterone to be more physically attractive, and these high testosterone-preferring women are more likely to initiate romantic interest in the male and more likely to have a desire for multiple sexual partners[24]. These behaviors all involve displaying physical prowess or using physically aggressive means of attracting females, including competitive behaviors, sexual advances, and direct verbal threats. These behaviors demonstrate that men seek to attract females by displaying a lot of testosterone.<n><n>### 7 questions<n><n>### Question:A team of 160 people were participating in aerobic exercise at high intensity. The group was subdivided into two smaller groups. The first group received a testosterone boost and the second group did not. Which group performed the best?<n><n>### Answer:Group that received testosterone boost. <n>### Group exercise increased oxygen uptake and heart rate.<n>### Blood was drawn and researchers gave the testosterone gel topical 160mg/s to the boost group.<n>### Study conclusion was that this type of exercise increased testosterone levels.<n>### Exercise results have direct positive benefits on testosterone levels by improving physical energy and strength. This suggests a reason male participation is so high, but exercise can be good for women as well.<n><n>### Question<n>What can be used as a non-invasive, in-home saliva test that

I can understand why you would want to learn on your own especially with English. Your level seems to be basic or beginning where you are currently at, and you can't get too deep into vocabulary for that level. I believe in a way that's kind of the idea behind your interest in learning on her own.<n><n>With that being said I believe there are a couple of resources that could help you on your way to learning on your own. If you google resources about learning English, you should find a huge list. From there you want to go on to decide which you think is the most useful and find resources to get books or videos to help you. You also want to make sure you find resources that are easy to understand. This means that you do not plan on reading a textbook and then jumping to the answers immediately. I recommend starting off with something easier than a textbook. A simple website or app or something that has a lot of explanations before you give practice would probably help you the most in my opinion.<n><n>Hope that encourages you Emily and I hope to see you back at school soon.<n>Regards,<n>Your Friend,<n>Alice<n><n>### Instructiion: Answer the following multiple choice question for your friend, who is going to learn English on her/his own.<n><n>### Options:<n>Choice: A:  The text is written for a reader who speaks some English, can read and write simple sentences at a basic level and is eager to learn vocabulary and phrases.

This is because, in a multiple choice question, you only provide one correct answer, students may see the correct answer but not be able to explain how they got there, also, the student is working on memorizing the correct answer, which will only work on a test if the students already know how to solve the question and they remember the correct answer, <n><n>### Example<n><n>Question: 	You need to find out how to add fractions. How can you use a table? <n><n>Answer:	In order to find fractions, you can use tables, a table provides a way to visually analyze a problem easily. <n><n><n>### Conclusions<n><n>Students should be taught how to use a table to make problems easier, how to complete the task of finding the sum of two fractions.<n><n>### Example 2<n><n>Input: Explain how you can find how to add fractions using tables?<n>Answer: <n><n>### Input<n><n>You need to find how many hours did a classroom work after school over four days last week.

{"text": "The answer to the question the students were asking Sammy was **populated areas**.  I added **population** as an answer because I saw a student adding that as an answer.\n\n#### Explanation:\nThe question the students were asking was simple and direct.  The students just wanted to know where the people were. However, Sammy had other ideas.  Sammy wanted to think for another second. He wanted to figure out what they could get for thinking of a place filled with people. The idea was to do something that was going to bring an idea, they would have to think of a place with people.  The idea was not to let on the place Sammy was thinking of. Sammy realized that people were not talking to him. When did he realize that he was not the only one thinking about the question anymore?\n\n#### Explanator:\nSammy said he was the fastest runner.  When Sammy did not get a response, he realized that he was thinking about something that no one else was thinking about.   He started talking about different places.  He realized that he was going to have to use their words to show he was thinking.  There seemed to be no one else talking.  Sammy wanted the idea to sink into the minds of the students.  He said that thinking hard and then thinking again gave him the idea of where the people were.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nSammy started to think for another few seconds.  He wanted to think of any ideas that the students might have thought of before he came up with an idea.  He did not want to look like he had given up yet, but he did not want to get another idea that no one had given any indication that they had the same idea.  He had been trying to figure out what a place was where people were.\n\n> The students had been trying to figure something out.\n\nThe question should be simple to answer and the person asking the question should expect the answer to be a specific thing or idea. The people asking the question are expecting a yes or no question or something that is related to the question they want to ask.  \n\n# Part 2:  (2)\n\n### Instructions:\nGive a response that appropriately includes details of your choice.\n\n### Question:\n> The teacher needed to figure out the problem of the old ladies indoor cat.

But then I was around the students & had to help them understand there work or give them help if they need it. I was around 7 years old in 9th grade but it's a little different helping my class in a classroom full of 8, 7 & 6 year old kids. They are also more advanced in their age compared to my class. When it came to the math I could do a simple 5th grade level math but the students math was more advanced. In my language class I have students from 8th grade & 9th grade and then the classes I'm helping kids my grade so I have to give them 2 different types of support. I had to remember the classes I'd been in during my years in elementary. 2-2:10, 3-2;10, 4-11-11:30, 5-4:55, 6th-5:20. They are in a class full of 9th grade students and when I'm helping 9th grade students I know a bit a bit more their classes and homework. I have to remember they have 3 classes in a day so it's about a 1 hour of study. When it came to studying for a test I had to help students I've been in their same classes so I remember what they are studying or what they are looking for. I found it was a little different helping 7th & 6th grade students because they are in a classroom full with many kids in there and I think it's harder for the teachers. I help 5th grade students in a classroom full 5th grade but they are there most of their day. When the classes are small they can have to go to the library or a computer lab but if the class is large I do not know this.

First we take the words \"Listening is key\" and we break it up into two parts: \"Listening\" and \"is key\"\n \nThe part \"Listening is\" is simply an adjective phrase that is modifying the part \"is key\", so if we look at \"is key\" it is still telling us something about the verb \"is\". \n \nWe know that the verb \"is\" takes a subject and an object and that the verb \"is key\" should also have a subject and an object but we cannot be sure of exactly what they are because the adjective phrase \"Listening\" gets in \n \nthe way and we cannot tell if it is the subject or object. We need to figure out whether or not \"Listening is\" an adjective OR adverb before we can determine what we are looking for.\n \n \nIf you think about it, this part of \"Listening\" seems more like an adverb because it is telling us about the verb \"Listening\" instead of telling us about \n \nthe subject or object. You may be thinking \"How much do the nouns in the sentence matter?\" The answer is actually more than you think. The nouns in the subject \n \nof this sentence are \"The astronauts\" and the nouns in this sentence's object are \"The astronaut's main way to gain knowledge.\"\n \nWhat I want you to do now is look at your sentence and decide if you think \"Listening\" is an adverb or an adjective before you look at my answer.\n \n \ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc48\ud884\udd10\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc48\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd97\ud828\udc46\ud835\udd85\ud835\udd8a\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe  I bet you feel pretty smug!\n \nNow, here is me correcting your sentence. It is actually an adjective.\n \n@student: The teacher told all the students to \"Listening was key\" they'd gain", "answer": "C: knowlege"}

After that, I will tell them that the formula is to multiply 4 by the number of sides they add up to.\n\nThen I will ask the class to answer questions about if this shape will have a 4, 5, or 6 sides. I will ask the class what type of question this is. \n\nI will demonstrate on the board a 4 sided shape, and I will explain that we can do the same with a 5 sided shape and I will explain that it would work the same. After that, I'll ask the class how many sides the 6 sided shape would have.  \n\nI will explain that the students have to decide if they can do what I did and give them the opportunity to choose a shape after they have chosen. \nI will ask the class how to decide if the other shapes have sides.

A cat was found after the field trip, which had to be brought back indoors because it wasn't indoor only. The lizards were on the rocks, their home, and on the ground.

{"text": "The fish spend a majority of their time in the body of water.\n\n### The question to answer:\nWhere did the old ladies indoors pet cat stay?\n\n### How can you get the answer?\nFor cat that means that the cat, is in a location that isn't external. So it is indoors. But we are not interested only the location. Because there is many locations in a house, there is many places to put a cat and in a house you can find a lot of indoor things, so you can say that cat stay at the residence, but this would be too specific information to answer for the question. What we want to know is that the cat stayed somewhere that was indoors, not outdoors. To answer for the question we have to search the question until we can find an exact location that is indoors. So for example, we can answer with the choice ''c'', because that choice is the most general and it answers exactly what is needed or what the question is looking for, to be more specific it's the answer the question looks for, so the correct answer is (c), residence. With a (b) or (d) answer would not be the answer what the teacher is asking.", "answer": "C: underwater"}

The International Space Station has built in protection against this risk.\nThe crew gets some protection by sitting or standing in front of the aluminum doors used to protect the crew from micrometeoroids (small \nmeteorites) during reentry into the earth's atmosphere. However astronauts don't have the convenience of just throwing their head in a hole to be \nshielded. While on one side the doors protect the crew from dangerous meteorites flying through space, on the other side the crew is bombarded \nwith radiation. The solution was to reimagine a part of the space that they didn't know was possible.The doors had to be made transparent, and the \ncrew had to live with the doors shielding them from harm. The astronauts use a transparent plastic shield to protect them from radiation in the \nsame way that a diver's helmet protects against the water pressure. This solution required the astronauts to live in this uncomfortable and \nunfamiliar environment for the week they are in orbit. Astronauts have to sleep standing up with their feet together and their hips locked together \nto fit into their new living quarters! \n\n### Exercise:\n\n* If you knew that you were being shot at by a bullet that is moving at 600mph, which is", "answer": "A: airplane"}

I can have students write in a journal about a concept or have them manipulate objects to solidify their understanding. I also enjoy having students draw what is going on in their mind to better articulate their thoughts in written form. Tactile learning can be incorporated into all subjects/ topics.\n### Example:\nStudents read about a chapter in a novel. Students are then asked to answer questions about what they just read.\n### Example 2:\nStudents study 10 states from a region in the United States. Each state has unique qualities and geography. The students are given a project that involves building a puzzle and then drawing the states.The students use their senses to build and observe the puzzle pieces to learn about the geography of the United States.\n### Example3:\nStudents watch an episode of a foreign television show. There after, they discuss what language/ vocabulary words can be connected to the episode that they viewed. Students can then write the language word in the language it is found in and next to it they write the English translation.\n### Example4:\nStudents practice the alphabet song in English. One day the teacher sings the alphabet song in Spanish instead. The students then try to change the words to their known English language words and later they are asked to try the song in a different langauge.\n### Example5:\nA teacher uses a game during an activity to have students work together to demonstrate their understanding of the concepts she is teaching.\n### Example6:\nA teacher has a student describe an object that they see on a table.

{"text": "We're trying to help with your homework, and we want your assignment to be the greatest it possibly can be, so we have to ask you one question: how much time do you need to do well on this assignment? The answer to this question may not seem like the obvious answer, but it's the right one. You can take as much time as possible to do your best work, but if you don't give yourself enough time to do well, then all of your other hard work will be wasted.\n\n### Input :While going through some of your old papers, your grandmother found a folder that she hadn\u2019t seen in years.

At the time, he was confused and didn\u2019t want to move forward in his life because he thought that he was the only person in the world who could see himself through the lens of his story.  However, reading the book taught him that although he is the only person who can see himself through the lense of his story, everybody else looks at him and sees somebody different.  In other words, everybody has their own story, and while everybody has a different perspective of themselves, everybody is uniquely beautiful in their own way.", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}

{"text": "I am a software programmer and I was contacted by you recently looking for a programmer for a new project. You expressed interest in me for the position due to the fact that I have previously helped companies like Microsoft, Intuit, and Dell with their software issues. My response, as per your request, was to provide you with some relevant information and my resume, which is attached above as Appendix A.\n\nMy first reaction once I discovered the nature of your request was to think of any programming tasks you may be needing help with. My background lies in software programming/development and I have a strong knowledge of many programming languages and environments that I am able to help with.\n\nI feel I can contribute to you effort as the lead program in a number of ways. The first being that I possess a strong background in software engineering and programming. My background goes back some twenty-five years. It would allow me to easily come on board and become a functioning member of your development team with minimal training.\n\nAlso, once I was awarded a contract from Dell I had to quickly learn various operating systems, and languages that I knew nothing about, and be able to function with it after only a short period of time. I feel I can learn something new as fast as I can to contribute to your development needs.\n\nMy qualifications match closely with your descriptions. However, based on my work experience, I feel I can add to your already existing staff. I am well versed in developing software systems that are used on a regular basis by companies as big as Microsoft, and as small as an entrepreneur developing the next big idea.\n\nMy education and work experience, combined with the necessary skills that are needed for this position, indicate you will increase the productivity and quality of your projects while reducing cost/increasing efficiency and quality. \n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you would consider me for this position. Please contact me at (555) 665-6890, or via email ([email blocked]&lt;[email blocked]>). I will make myself available for at least the next week so that I may discuss this in more detail.", "answer": "D: growth"}

{"text": "The instructor gave us a series of questions and an answer sheet. The students were supposed to be able to choose the answer to each question. The instructor wanted to know who understood the questions the best.\n\n### Output:\n\nWe can use our computer to answer questions by typing in the questions and the answers. Then, the computer will give you your score based on your percentage of correct answers.\n\n### Coding:\n\nThere is a lot of code that can be used to create something like this. I will show you how my program looks. I have made my program in Python 3.7.4 (32 bit) under Microsoft Operating System (Windows 10) using Python IDE-PyCharm Professional 2017.7.\n\nThe way my program works is that it asks a question through terminal using the `input` function. It has to be a string so that it can be given as an input to the `answer` function. I then use Python `while` loop, along with the `break` keyword to loop and ask another question. I continue looping until I receive an input that is an exit condition (i.e an input of `quit(True)`).\n\nIn the beginning of the program, I am using the `print` function to ask the user what they want. I then use Python dictionary to hold all the questions and answers. Python dictionaries are useful because we can directly access a key by specifying a key. For example the dict of questions.keys() will return a list of keys. The keys in my case are my question.\n\nThis is a list of questions and answer I am using.\n\n```python\nquestion = (\n    \"What can happen in your body while sleeping?\",\n    \"Snoring\",\n    \"Automobile accidents\",\n    \"Getting colder\",\n    \"Might dream\",\n    \"Talking nonsense\",\n)\n```\n\nand the answer are stored as:\n\n```python\nanswers = {\"snoring\": \"The question is What can happen in your body when sleeping?\",\n          \"automobile accidents\": \"Talk nonsense after becoming inebriates\",\n          \"getting colder\": \"Sleeping on the side that can get you colder\",\n          \"might dream\": \"You might dream\",\n          \"t", "answer": "E: might dream"}

There are a lot of people in the building so if the teacher were to write names of the entire building on a list which would make the list not only difficult to manage but also harder to understand and comprehend. Instead the teacher would submit the names of the students who did not act right. It's important that he or she uses some names.

{"text": "The correct answer is \"B\" -\"They (people who are in charge of a project) hire people who care about how they look.\"\n\n### Explanation:\n* The only right answer is \"B\".\n* Other choices can be eliminated because they don't fit the context and are clearly wrong. For instance, the context talks about project managers, and that is quite possibly a single person or a small group of people. Greedy is a rather unreasonable answer. People who are greedy do not necessarily fit the job or task for that matter. However, that is not the case here. Also, the context does not mention the person doing anything with their look or appearance. Worry is also not relevant. The author is clearly asking about the kind of people who will be found by a project manager if they are charged with hiring somebody. The author is not saying anything about a person who worries, he is talking about the kind of person charged with the task of hiring people. The person hired will not worry about their look before doing the job.\n* The choices of \"C\", \"D\" and \"E\" are all related to people management or people who are not directly involved in the project, yet. Therefore, it should be clear to the project manager that these people are not the people being sought.", "answer": "C: have knowledge"}

{"text": "The correct answer is C: bound.\nInput:\nInput:\nAnswer:\nThe correct answer choice is C: bound. The phrase \"packaged together\" means to bundle or pack something together. This phrase means to tie papers together, to make them strong enough to stand up.  It does not mean to bundle or pack paper together in a way that a binding can be used to hold them together.\n### A: tighten\nThe word \"tighten\" means to make something tighter. Something like a band or a string wrapped around something else is not an option. The phrase \"bind together\" means to secure papers with a binding. Another possibility is a sheet protector, which is a clear plastic sleeve that is used (together with paper) to keep papers from getting bent or dirty.\n### B: packaged\nThe phrase \"packaged together\". The word \"package\" means to wrap or bundle something, typically for shipping. So what you are asking about is \"paper\" being wrapped or bound together.\n### C: bound\nThe word \"bound\" means to tie or glue papers together. When bound, papers can stand up better, without bending or falling over.\n### D: faithful\nThe word, \"faithful\" means staying the same in form or substance, not changing. When papers are packaged together, they stay in a different form, which means that their shape and position changes. That is not the same as an original form, which is the \"faithful\" form.\n### E: compact\nThe phrase \"compact\" means to become smaller, shorter, thinner, or shorter. For example, people are compacting cars through different styles of transportation or making a computer compact. The word \"compact\" is used, typically, when they are becoming smaller.\n\n### The following questions have two answers, choose no more than one:\n\n### 1. The person wearing a blue short-sleeved shirt is?\n-\n### A: John\n-\n### B: Matt\n-\n### C: Greg\n-\n### D: Eric\n-\n### E: Allison\n\n### 2.

{"text": "The task in which I needed to answer a multiple choice question was to find out what a person needs to learn more about so that I could find more information when searching online.\n\nI should start by doing a web search for any person with a specific surname. In order to carry out this search, I will first do an investigation into how to look that information up. I will begin by doing the following steps:\n * First, I have to write out the person\u2019s name that I want to look up with their surname at the end.\n * Then I go to the search engine (Google) and type \u2018find a person with last name\u2019 and press the go to search button.\n\nI will start by doing a web research that will provide me with relevant answers for what I am looking for.\n\nThe next step is to look at the information provided online and in websites specifically that provide data related. Some examples would be the white pages, social media sites such as Facebook, MySpace, etc. There are also many places where one could look for free information such as business directories and the information is usually for anyone over the age of 18. Finally, the phone book or Yellow Pages are another good way to look for contact information.\n\n### Input2:\nThe next steps will help me to figure out what will likely happen to someone\u2019s speech after becoming heavily intoxicated.\n After research, I have found that after someone is intoxicated it is more likely that they could be impaired when talking. It usually takes a few drinks before the alcohol causes the person\u2019s speech to sound incoherent and slurred. When a person becomes intoxicated, it can cause a person to lose their ability to think clearly and talk normally, as well.\n\n### Response2:\nThe task in which you needed to tell what will happen to someone speech after being heavily intoxicated, was to have a better understanding about what will happen to your speech after being intoxicated.\n\nNext steps to do after completion of research: Write out the person\u2019s speech that I want to look at in a research paper. Then I go to the Internet to find other ways to look up that information. In addition, I go to the search bar and type, \"find\" the name of the person and their last name.

The lab results have been compiled from your peers, so all you need to do is analyse the data. Your group had a meeting and identified each person's blood that had a particular genetic defect. The group thought it was important to have each person's blood for study as they had different genetic defects. As well as a blood sample, the group is looking to study someone's voice, an individual's memory and their musical talents (dance and singing) and their weight and height. They also need a family tree to identify the family's blood types and find out who had which blood type.\n\nYour team will need to use a phone book, a roster and a directory to find the details of which family members had what blood type.\n\nNow all that's left is to find all the other information like their height, weight and IQs. \n\n### Explanation (optional)\n\nWrite a statement that describes why some data is collected in each experiment.\n\n  Explanation - This blood bank has all the samples the team needs to study and analyse each of the samples.

Then I had to take careful note of all the information because if there was more than one thing I think we are going to need to pick the best answer based on what I know about what we're told in the lesson. The lesson explained that we don't need to know everything that's asked of us because we will need help. So this is the perfect place to take it slow and read it out loud as many times as it takes to understand what's being asked. This is a very important principle for the real work because when we get in there and do some research we're going to have to read what we found out about many things and sometimes it's not clear whether we are trying to find more about them and other times we are working to learn who we need to find information to find out what we were wanting to know about in the first place. \n\n### Response 2: I needed to find a safe place to sleep at night.

According to the task, the person's name did not come up so I decided to use another word: directory. I found the directory which is the place that lists residential addresses and phone numbers. I searched the website and called various places looking for a person whose name I had. Then, I decided to look through the phone book for a person with my name. This was the next choice. I did not find anyone but I got a new idea, I tried the local restaurant. However, my name did not appear on the reservation sheet or the guest-book.\n\nI knew the person was no longer a student, so I began searching all of the places in my area that had been looking for a job. The first list was available on the computer, so I started looking. In the back of this list there was a certificate that the organization used to verify who they hired as an employee.\n\nI opened the first door. The door led to a room where there were many large tables and people seated at the tops of the tables having lunch. Suddenly, the people started to stand up and walk toward the door leading outside so I decided to follow them. Outside, the people were standing in front of the door and looking up at a screen that showed a list of phone numbers. They were searching the screen for their names. Then, they moved on to the next door.\n\nI opened that door and found the telephone directory. The phone book told me the name of the organization that I was looking through.\n\nWhen I called the office I was given the phone number for the manager's office and was given the contact's name as well - the manager's assistant. When I contacted her she said that she was no longer working for the organization and was now working for a different organization where she had been promoted to the position of the head manager.

Better understanding can be used in any context as a good or proper way of understanding something or somebody and also making decisions base on what we know. For example, if a person is planning a trip and needs to hire a taxi, he probably has some kind of idea where to look because he has visited the place before. In such an instance, he can understand what to do because the situation requires his level of understanding. The situation then can not be understood if a person is asked questions by the police. He may be able to answer many questions but is unable to provide a detailed explanation on how to contact a particular person due to not knowing the details of how to contact him. What\u2019s more, if a person is a student looking for an opportunity, he might know of many job offers around him. And if he is a person in that market he would look for such a job offer. He would also know where to find such a job, but he would not know where the other one is, this is where he would require some kind of better understanding. \n\n\n## [Phone_Book](Phone_Book.md) \nPhone_Book Phone book can be used as a good understanding for something or anybody or a means for finding something. Phone book can also be used to tell someone to search for a particular person as in knowing where that person can be found. Example, if you needed to call a particular person from your list of contacts on your phone, but you\u2019ve lost it, you should use the phone book. That way, you might find the number, the address of the person or a person who can help you find the real number of the person you are looking for.

{"text": "While it can be difficult to tell the difference between choices A, B, and E sometimes, there are a few general guidelines you can use when reading through text that follows the format of these instructions.\n\nWhen reading a text you would likely never write yourself, the wording will tend to be highly specialized and the content will usually be focused on one core idea.\n\nSome writers in these formats seem to be so focused on expressing their ideas in as much detail as possible that they seem to spend more time expressing their ideas than actually telling the reader how to approach the problem.\n\nYou would never write a passage using choice A, it is always best to be as clear and direct as possible when writing. Choices B and E however, are two examples of formats used in textbooks that provide step-by-step instructions.\n\nWhen faced with choice B or E, look for the \"How To:\" or instructions section of the text. This section will almost always be near, or directly after the chapter title - for example: chapter 01:How to start and end a paper, chapter 02:How to cite sources, chapter 03:How to write a cover letter.\n\nIn these sections you can read about how to approach a task that directly relates to the format of the book - for example cite sources, write a cover letter, etc.", "answer": "C: bible"}

The person isn't putting make up or clothing for no reasons. Makeup is something girls use to attact men. A man was never described while the woman was dressing to get interesting experiences.\n### Input 2. \nA person is putting the drink on the table. What is their likely goal? \n\n### Response2:drink\n### Explanotion:\n\"drink\" and \"drinking\" are both right because the man was never specified and drinking could be something both men and women would do.\n\nThe person was trying to drink more alcohol because drinking alcohol is usually done so that one can taste the flavor of alcohol and it makes people happy.\n\n### Input3:\nYou might be able to find a contact's name in?

{"text": "I needed to find out how the toxicologist deciphered the substance that the police had found at the crime scene. The first step that I needed to do was to conduct research on what a toxicologist does. The toxicologist usually gets involved in an investigation when they are asked to inspect or analyse a sample. They need to identify what substance it is, what it does and what its effects might be. I used an online search to help me. I have to look for the keywords like: Crime scene investigation toxicology and toxicologist. The result had given me several links to websites. Most of the results I found were government websites and the others were university websites. Once I have found the information, I checked it for accuracy.

It's safer than not wearing them. It was safer for me, since my eyes were kept protected, even accidentally if I were to splash the isopropyl alcool solution on my eye.

Since isopropyl alcohe is toxic to cells, when being used at room temperature and as such are likely to damage the eyes in very long periods of exposure. But overall, they won't hurt you. If you're wearing contacts, it's even more advisable to wear them. To find some answer, I had looked into on the internet. I looked for articles, website and books which I could find on the internet. I searched for safety to contact lenses, and I found that it's better if we protect our eyes when we are using alcohol solution. We need to be very careful and careful if we don't wear glasses while using alcohol solution because when we splashed the isopropyl solution, it would go into our eyes because of our contacts, and that's what I observed from the site.

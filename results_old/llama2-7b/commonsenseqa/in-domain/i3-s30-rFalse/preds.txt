Choices:  A: illinois B: woods C: new york D: indiana E: farmer's market<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>It takes a lot of money to maintain all those farms and to supply the supermarkets with what they need. To save time, the apples are grown at local farms and harvested, packed, and frozen all at once. Most of the apples that are stocked at the store are actually grown in one place and then flown to the supermarket.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>There are three apple tree groves on the farm: Red, Green, and Blue. The groves are close to each other, and each grove has roughly the same amount of trees. Each of the three groves have about 300,000 apples stocked and ready to be harvested and trucked to the supermarket. Every day, the three groves are visited by the trucks where the apples are then selected and weighed. This takes around 8 hours before the grove is picked clean.<n><n>This process of harvesting, packing, and shipping is the main way of picking apples from the farms to the supermarkets and grocery stores that people frequent.<n>

The question is, "If I wanted to see....", therefore we can reasonably guess that it is asking a question about a place. The options don't really provide any real insight. I don't know how to contact the certain person and I don't know what could happen to a person who's been inebriated. And there are no reptiles in America. But a lizard is a reptile, so I figured Japanese sounds the most logical, despite the fact that I don't know why. I don't even have a reason behind my reasoning to choose Japanese.<n><n>### Conclusion:<n>The conclusion for this response is that the correct answer for this question was to go to japan to see a lizard.

The robot used a vocabulary containing 12,000 words and its working memory contained 876,000 words. The robot was able to distinguish between the two words.<n>### Demontration:<n>The human memory contains information about the past, like your own experiences that come together and form the basis for you to form opinions and beliefs about it. The computer is an extension of the human brain which is not an equivalent to the brain. The computer has a way of processing the brain's information and is not able to think like a human, therefore the human brain is different from the computer. The human brain has to work together, while the computer is an extension.<n>

Choices A: Smile B: Shake hands, C: Express gratitude, D: Say "you're welcome", E: Appreciate compliment<n><n>The correct answer to this question is E: Appreciate Compliment.<n><n>### Analysis<n>Greetings and salutations can help express feelings and can be used in a social conversation and even in the business domain. Greetings are normally used in a professional setting where the person addressing you is doing so out of politeness and not because they are friends or family. Greetings are a good way to open the floor for a conversation.<n><n>One of the most well-known greetings is “Hello.” "Hello" comes in many different variations, like “hi”, "how do you do?”, and “hey”. All of these types of greetings are acceptable alternatives to an old-fashioned “hello.”<n><n>As for responses, saying "thank you" is just as important to a discussion as is greetings. In a business context, it is best to always say thank you to someone when they make a good point, say something helpful, or just in general compliment you.<n>

Choices:  A: headaches B: bigger brain C: education D: growth E: knowing more<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I am a software programmer and I was contacted by you recently looking for a programmer for a new project. You expressed interest in me for the position due to the fact that I have previously helped companies like Microsoft, Intuit, and Dell with their software issues. My response, as per your request, was to provide you with some relevant information and my resume, which is attached above as Appendix A.<n><n>My first reaction once I discovered the nature of your request was to think of any programming tasks you may be needing help with. My background lies in software programming/development and I have a strong knowledge of many programming languages and environments that I am able to help with.<n><n>I feel I can contribute to you effort as the lead program in a number of ways. The first being that I possess a strong background in software engineering and programming. My background goes back some twenty-five years. It would allow me to easily come on board and become a functioning member of your development team with minimal training.<n><n>Also, once I was awarded a contract from Dell I had to quickly learn various operating systems, and languages that I knew nothing about, and be able to function with it after only a short period of time. I feel I can learn something new as fast as I can to contribute to your development needs.<n><n>My qualifications match closely with your descriptions. However, based on my work experience, I feel I can add to your already existing staff. I am well versed in developing software systems that are used on a regular basis by companies as big as Microsoft, and as small as an entrepreneur developing the next big idea.<n><n>My education and work experience, combined with the necessary skills that are needed for this position, indicate you will increase the productivity and quality of your projects while reducing cost/increasing efficiency and quality. <n><n>I would greatly appreciate it if you would consider me for this position. Please contact me at (555) 665-6890, or via email ([email blocked]&lt;[email blocked]>). I will make myself available for at least the next week so that I may discuss this in more detail.

I’m not too sure if I should feel good or guilty about the things I found. I’m not sure how to feel for the things we find out about ourselves and the things I find out about others. I am confused about the way you are feeling after you get in trouble. I am thinking the way you are feeling, but that might just be how I am feeling. I am still not sure what I am feeling, and I wish you could tell me what you are feeling. I am curious about what is happening with the new virus coming from the chinese. I know we should all be wearing face shields while we are doing our activities, if a virus like this could pop up from that place. I don’t feel good after drinking, but I think I might be more into something that would make me more happy than just getting drunk. I am confused about all the talk about how good drugs are, and why people take them. I feel bad for the people who just got back from holiday that couldn’t come with their families because of the coronavirus. I feel bad that someone’s pet died because a virus got him/her when he/she was coming from holiday with their family. I found that in the end, you never know what could affect your life, and what could happen next. I guess that was a lot of things I found out. I hope that’s enough for now.<n>2: I started to work on finding the correct answers

It was a terrible time, I was stressed, fatigued, dehydrated and experiencing severe gastrodistress. I decided to consult a good friend who was a dietitian. As I told her all that was happening at that time, she told me in a calm voice, "Jon, my friend, you need to eat, we get a few small meals each day, in case you hadn't noticed, we are all human beings and you must eat, not just because I say so, eat to live. Remember, it is essential to eat." She was right, and I did. In return my illness faded away. What had I learned was that the human body needs to be nourished properly and the only way to achieve this is by eating. This was one of the greatest lessons I learned from her. How had I been living my life before being sick? As a result of my health crisis, I was determined to make it my health my first choice. Eating is fundamental to our survival as human beings. The human body will not survive without nourishment.<n>### Instruction : Choose the best response for each statement. <n>

Therefore, the answer choice must start with a pronoun whose gender matches that of the name in the sentence. This makes the answer choice B. The sentence itself is not grammatically correct and is intended to teach the student to look for the missing words among pronouns. The correct answer will not be B but the person, and it is up to the student to identify the person named in the sentence.<n>

I will show you how my program looks. I have made my program in Python 3.7.4 (32 bit) under Microsoft Operating System (Windows 10) using Python IDE-PyCharm Professional 2017.7.<n><n>The way my program works is that it asks a question through terminal using the `input` function. It has to be a string so that it can be given as an input to the `answer` function. I then use Python `while` loop, along with the `break` keyword to loop and ask another question. I continue looping until I receive an input that is an exit condition (i.e an input of `quit(True)`).<n><n>In the beginning of the program, I am using the `print` function to ask the user what they want. I then use Python dictionary to hold all the questions and answers. Python dictionaries are useful because we can directly access a key by specifying a key. For example the dict of questions.keys() will return a list of keys. The keys in my case are my question.<n><n>This is a list of questions and answer I am using.<n><n>```python<n>question = (<n>    "What can happen in your body while sleeping?",<n>    "Snoring",<n>    "Automobile accidents",<n>    "Getting colder",<n>    "Might dream",<n>    "Talking nonsense",<n>)<n>```<n><n>and the answer are stored as:<n><n>```python<n>answers = {"snoring": "The question is What can happen in your body when sleeping?",<n>          "automobile accidents": "Talk nonsense after becoming inebriates",<n>          "getting colder": "Sleeping on the side that can get you colder",<n>          "might dream": "You might dream",<n>          "t

But I will answer this by adding some extra information. There are a lot of people in the building so if the teacher were to write names of the entire building on a list which would make the list not only difficult to manage but also harder to understand and comprehend. Instead the teacher would submit the names of the students who did not act right. It's important that he or she uses some names. The problem that the teacher may be having is finding the names that are in the right to the student list. He would also only use a few names so there wouldn't be a lot of confusion throughout the building. Students that are doing well and behaving should be on the list.<n><n>### Other instructions:<n>A government seeks control over its people.<n><n>### Correct Answer:<n>The correct answer to this answer is B.

The graphite is the part of the pencil that can be written on paper or any surface to make it appear like a card game. The game of cards doesn't have anything to do with the lead-making process. Once all the lead is removed, there is still an apparatus or what we refer to as a lead-in, and that's how we know this is the card game.<n><n>### Solution:<n><img src="img\card1.PNG" alt="a diagram of playing cards" width="194" height="214" srcset="img\card1_2x.PNG 2x" /><n><br><n><img src="http://www.carswallpaper.com/images/images/cars/5.jpg" alt="A drawing of black card game" width="256" height="383" srcset="http://www.k-p-photographies.fr/img/2475433/400x32333.jpg 400w" /><n><n>

Choices:  A: greedy B: worry C: have knowledge D: take charge E: boss<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is "B" -"They (people who are in charge of a project) hire people who care about how they look."<n><n>### Explanation:<n>* The only right answer is "B".<n>* Other choices can be eliminated because they don't fit the context and are clearly wrong. For instance, the context talks about project managers, and that is quite possibly a single person or a small group of people. Greedy is a rather unreasonable answer. People who are greedy do not necessarily fit the job or task for that matter. However, that is not the case here. Also, the context does not mention the person doing anything with their look or appearance. Worry is also not relevant. The author is clearly asking about the kind of people who will be found by a project manager if they are charged with hiring somebody. The author is not saying anything about a person who worries, he is talking about the kind of person charged with the task of hiring people.

Choices:  A: tighten B: packaged C: bound D: faithful E: compact<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is C: bound.<n>Input:<n>Input:<n>Answer:<n>The correct answer choice is C: bound. The phrase "packaged together" means to bundle or pack something together. This phrase means to tie papers together, to make them strong enough to stand up.  It does not mean to bundle or pack paper together in a way that a binding can be used to hold them together.<n>### A: tighten<n>The word "tighten" means to make something tighter. Something like a band or a string wrapped around something else is not an option. The phrase "bind together" means to secure papers with a binding. Another possibility is a sheet protector, which is a clear plastic sleeve that is used (together with paper) to keep papers from getting bent or dirty.<n>### B: packaged<n>The phrase "packaged together". The word "package" means to wrap or bundle something, typically for shipping. So what you are asking about is "paper" being wrapped or bound together.<n>### C: bound<n>The word "bound" means to tie or glue papers together. When bound, papers can stand up better, without bending or falling over.<n>### D: faithful<n>The word, "faithful" means staying the same in form or substance, not changing. When papers are packaged together, they stay in a different form, which means that their shape and position changes. That is not the same as an original form, which is the "faithful" form.<n>### E: compact<n>The phrase "compact" means to become smaller, shorter, thinner, or shorter. For example, people are compacting cars through different styles of transportation or making a computer compact. The word "compact" is used, typically, when they are becoming smaller.<n><n>### The following questions have two answers, choose no more than one:<n><n>### 1.

She faced a lot of what? Choices:  A: ignoring B: being rude C: disparagement D: contumely E: uncertainty<n><n>### Response:		The most likely answer would be **D: contumely**.<n><n>### Contumely is the act or feeling of being scorned, despised, or scornfully rejected. In John's case, he has a lot of respect for his superior so it is unlikely she will be faced with contumely. Disparagement and disrespect are also not a likely choice because John does not respect the other people in his group. Ignoring and being rude are the options that would face Jill the most since she faces being treated as if she is of an inferior nature by her coworkers. <n>

Some airline also let you borrow it);<n>- IPod or IPhone (they can play online movies or stream the movies and programs directly from the website);<n>- Tablet (It can store a lot of movie and game, they have a lot more apps and much more games than a phone);<n>- The TV embedded on the seat (sometimes the TV embedded on the seat can connect to the internet and play some video).<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple responses question.<n><n>## Instruction:<n>Input: I wanted to buy a new car, but I hadn't bought a new car in the last ten years.

Choices:  A: laugh B: sit C: happiness D: being entertained E: walk slowly<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The task in which I needed to answer a multiple choice question was to find out what a person needs to learn more about so that I could find more information when searching online.<n><n>I should start by doing a web search for any person with a specific surname. In order to carry out this search, I will first do an investigation into how to look that information up. I will begin by doing the following steps:<n> * First, I have to write out the person’s name that I want to look up with their surname at the end.<n> * Then I go to the search engine (Google) and type ‘find a person with last name’ and press the go to search button.<n><n>I will start by doing a web research that will provide me with relevant answers for what I am looking for.<n><n>The next step is to look at the information provided online and in websites specifically that provide data related. Some examples would be the white pages, social media sites such as Facebook, MySpace, etc. There are also many places where one could look for free information such as business directories and the information is usually for anyone over the age of 18. Finally, the phone book or Yellow Pages are another good way to look for contact information.<n><n>### Input2:<n>The next steps will help me to figure out what will likely happen to someone’s speech after becoming heavily intoxicated.<n> After research, I have found that after someone is intoxicated it is more likely that they could be impaired when talking. It usually takes a few drinks before the alcohol causes the person’s speech to sound incoherent and slurred. When a person becomes intoxicated, it can cause a person to lose their ability to think clearly and talk normally, as well.<n><n>### Response2:<n>The task in which you needed to tell what will happen to someone speech after being heavily intoxicated, was to have a better understanding about what will happen to your speech after being intoxicated.<n><n>Next steps to do after completion of research: Write out the person’s speech that I want to look at in a research paper. Then I go to the Internet to find other ways to look up that information. In addition, I go to the search bar and type, "find" the name of the person and their last name. Then I search for free sites where you can get the answer.<n><n><n>

As well as a blood sample, the group is looking to study someone's voice, an individual's memory and their musical talents (dance and singing) and their weight and height. They also need a family tree to identify the family's blood types and find out who had which blood type.<n><n>Your team will need to use a phone book, a roster and a directory to find the details of which family members had what blood type.<n><n>Now all that's left is to find all the other information like their height, weight and IQs. <n><n>### Explanation (optional)<n><n>Write a statement that describes why some data is collected in each experiment.<n><n>  Explanation - This blood bank has all the samples the team needs to study and analyse each of the samples.

Choices:  A: mediate B: have rest C: stay in bed D: run out of steam E: go to sleep<n><n>### Response:		 I needed to make sure I understood what was asked before I answered. Then I had to take careful note of all the information because if there was more than one thing I think we are going to need to pick the best answer based on what I know about what we're told in the lesson. The lesson explained that we don't need to know everything that's asked of us because we will need help. So this is the perfect place to take it slow and read it out loud as many times as it takes to understand what's being asked. This is a very important principle for the real work because when we get in there and do some research we're going to have to read what we found out about many things and sometimes it's not clear whether we are trying to find more about them and other times we are working to learn who we need to find information to find out what we were wanting to know about in the first place. <n><n>### Response 2: I needed to find a safe place to sleep at night.

I have to remind myself that this was the purpose of the class: To try to answer this prompt.<n>- I did not take enough time to reflect on the prompt when answering the prompt.<n>- I also did not take enough time reading the prompt in the end, resulting in a rushed answer.<n><n>### I felt that by the time I rushed to answer this prompt, it was almost rushed in order to answer the next prompt already given.<n>- I felt more comfortable in class answering the prompts the whole way through, instead of rushing to answer, but then feeling the need to rush again.

In order to do this one must understand and communicate with others, in the case of our study we were asked to describe something that makes our language unique and one of these components in my humble opinion is the fact that, it isn't just based on the written and vocal forms of communication but on verbal communication as well.<n>For it is with the way we speak and the expressions we use that we can understand people in a much better and intuitive level.<n>Another part of the assignment that I believe that we all had a mutual problem with would be how to contact a person for a more specific information, I don't know what the other members chose but the solution was, and should be, the phone boos, I mean the phone book.<n>Finally about the last question about what is likely to happen, after someone has been in drinking alcohol, the most probable thing that would happen, I think, to most people, would be the inability to speak clearly in a sober way, this is how much it affects the brain, and therefore the ability to speak, I know it sounds like it isn't related but believe me it is very much so.<n><n>I wish I could include more on this, however, with the nature of the assignment and being the limit of this assignment. I think I have made an adequate summary.<n>

Choices:  A: fresh fruit B: wine press C: fruit basket D: fruit cocktail E: picnic basket<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I needed to find out what the person's name was, so I checked the roster of names because roster means the list of names. According to the task, the person's name did not come up so I decided to use another word: directory. I found the directory which is the place that lists residential addresses and phone numbers. I searched the website and called various places looking for a person whose name I had. Then, I decided to look through the phone book for a person with my name. This was the next choice. I did not find anyone but I got a new idea, I tried the local restaurant. However, my name did not appear on the reservation sheet or the guest-book.<n><n>I knew the person was no longer a student, so I began searching all of the places in my area that had been looking for a job. The first list was available on the computer, so I started looking. In the back of this list there was a certificate that the organization used to verify who they hired as an employee.<n><n>I opened the first door. The door led to a room where there were many large tables and people seated at the tops of the tables having lunch. Suddenly, the people started to stand up and walk toward the door leading outside so I decided to follow them. Outside, the people were standing in front of the door and looking up at a screen that showed a list of phone numbers. They were searching the screen for their names. Then, they moved on to the next door.<n><n>I opened that door and found the telephone directory. The phone book told me the name of the organization that I was looking through.<n><n>When I called the office I was given the phone number for the manager's office and was given the contact's name as well - the manager's assistant. When I contacted her she said that she was no longer working for the organization and was now working for a different organization where she had been promoted to the position of the head manager. The head manager's assistant told me I could talk to the head manager and that her secretary could help me find the person I was looking for - because the head managers secretary is the one who does the head manager's administrative work.<n>

Better understanding can be used in any context as a good or proper way of understanding something or somebody and also making decisions base on what we know. For example, if a person is planning a trip and needs to hire a taxi, he probably has some kind of idea where to look because he has visited the place before. In such an instance, he can understand what to do because the situation requires his level of understanding. The situation then can not be understood if a person is asked questions by the police. He may be able to answer many questions but is unable to provide a detailed explanation on how to contact a particular person due to not knowing the details of how to contact him. What’s more, if a person is a student looking for an opportunity, he might know of many job offers around him. And if he is a person in that market he would look for such a job offer. He would also know where to find such a job, but he would not know where the other one is, this is where he would require some kind of better understanding. <n><n><n>## [Phone_Book](Phone_Book.md) <n>Phone_Book Phone book can be used as a good understanding for something or anybody or a means for finding something. Phone book can also be used to tell someone to search for a particular person as in knowing where that person can be found. Example, if you needed to call a particular person from your list of contacts on your phone, but you’ve lost it, you should use the phone book. That way, you might find the number, the address of the person or a person who can help you find the real number of the person you are looking for. For a case if you found a particular person on the street lost, you can call a friend of

Choices:  A: pub B: restaurants C: in a park D: supermarket E: chemistry lab<n><n>### Response:		<n>I needed to find out how the toxicologist deciphered the substance that the police had found at the crime scene. The first step that I needed to do was to conduct research on what a toxicologist does. The toxicologist usually gets involved in an investigation when they are asked to inspect or analyse a sample. They need to identify what substance it is, what it does and what its effects might be. I used an online search to help me. I have to look for the keywords like: Crime scene investigation toxicology and toxicologist. The result had given me several links to websites. Most of the results I found were government websites and the others were university websites. Once I have found the information, I checked it for accuracy. I needed to ensure that the information that I found were valid. I need to make sure that the information that I am going to use is appropriate and the source of information is correct.<n><n>### Reports:<n>**1.** You have the choice of wearing safety glasses when using an isopropyl alcohol solution. It's safer than not wearing them. It was safer for me, since my eyes were kept protected, even accidentally if I were to splash the isopropyl alcool solution on my eye. The liquid is harmless for contact lenses, though it may still sting a bit when in contact with the eyes. Since isopropyl alcohe is toxic to cells, when being used at room temperature and as such are likely to damage the eyes in very long periods of exposure. But overall, they won't hurt you. If you're wearing contacts, it's even more advisable to wear them. To find some answer, I had looked into on the internet. I looked for articles, website and books which I could find on the internet. I searched for safety to contact lenses, and I found that it's better if we protect our eyes when we are using alcohol solution. We need to be very careful and careful if we don't wear glasses while using alcohol solution because when we splashed the isopropyl solution, it would go into our eyes because of our contacts, and that's what I observed from the site. From then on, my conclusion will be that I need to wear glasses when I use isopropyl solution.<n><n>**2.** I have conducted

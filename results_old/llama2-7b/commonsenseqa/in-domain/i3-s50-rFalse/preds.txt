Declare that we want to store something in the variable `var temp`. We will save what the cooldown function calls the temperature of the air.<n>2.

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box.

Choices:  A: radio station B: recording studio C: concert D: tv studio E: new york<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>* The referee called a penalty box foul.<n>* The microphone boom is likely to be used to capture sound in a recording studio.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>* When a referee calls a penalty box foul, they indicate that an illegal action has occurred. In a sporting event, fouls can refer to an instance of unethical conduct by one or more players, and can result in a reduction to points or a 5 to 15 minute suspension.<n>* The microphones used in a recording studio capture sound as air is pushed to and from the speakers. The microphone boom amplifies the sound while the microphone creates an impression of a sound that is captured more realistically.<n>* We can distinguish these examples based on the context. While we expect sports to provide realistic sound, we expect artists to produce more exaggerated sound. For example, a game of football is likely to provide a realistic impression of the game, but the music of the newest boyband is likely to amplify the sounds of the music.<n>* The context also guides us to identify the correct answer for the last example. Because microphones from concerts and recording studios can amplify sound, the microphone boom from a recording studio is likely to be used on-stage. While we expect a microphone from a concert to use a microphone boom, we expect a microphone used on air to have microphone boom from the radio station or television studio.<n>

You are doing the same thing as maths but in a different way for example in math you solve equations and inequalities, equations are something like (x * y = 30) but inequalities are (greater than or equal to 30) and equations are different to inequalities in many different ways like that. <n>In my view maths and programming are different in a lot of ways programming is something that you do on the computer like typing words that you do not speak like a text but maths is in your head and you do things like add, subtract, multiply and divide things.<n>A really good example of inequalities in everyday life would be that if you need to cross the the road you should not go at (greater than or to the left) of a crossing when the lights are red it is (greater than or more than) dangerous to cross a red light.<n><n>#### <n>

Biathlon is an individual event not a team sport so it is not fair to include it as an Olympic game but rather a competition. As far as ski ballet the Olympic Committee had to cut the sport due to financial reasons since they had limited spots for the games in 2008.<n><n><n>In terms of the actual sports themselves: The first Olympic Games where held in Ancient Greece. The ancient version of these games are called Olympiad Games are the most popular events today. These events include track, marathons, gymnastics, equestrian, shooting, diving and swimming. These events where held in cities, towns and countryside and where open to people of all ages. There was a great deal of competition for these prizes. Today, events like swimming, shooting, archery and canoeing are still being practiced  where track and field are the most popular and well known.<n><n><n>## Resources<n><n>

I like natural parks as well I may experience nature there too but I am also like to take a walk on the path or look at a landscape painting. I also like to visit malls which is part of a town.<n><n>### How to answer<n>  There are many museums around big towns there can be hundreds but we only will focus on the bigger museums which has a bigger impact of the big towns. A museum is a building for storing artifacts that contain objects, artworks, records. I like to visit a museum to learn it's history, know art pieces or know about some historical objects. They are educational place for those who take interest in its history but it's also a fun place to visit. Natural parks or landscape painting are natural sight for relaxation, those are places where you can experience nature and enjoy its scenery. One of the things you can experience in a mall is a big store of big brands which is part of a larger building such as a town.<n><n>

Choices:  A: found B: destroy C: construct D: fix E: produce<n><n>### Response:		<n>You seem to be asking more than one question, and one of the things you are doing is using one word to mean two things.  One word (or phrase) has two meanings, and the correct meaning is often context dependent.<n><n>Let's look at these questions:<n><n>1. "What is the kind of air coming out of your mouth?"<n>2. "What does a breath make if it doesn't show you're sick?"<n><n>Here is a list of words that all mean something to do with breathing:<n><n>1. blow a gasket<n>2. blow the whistle<n>3. blow a hole in<n>4. blow chunks<n>5. blow the trumpet<n><n>Some of these words mean something different than the word "breath".  In the first question, the word "breath" means the act of breathing, and in the second question, "breath" means to give breath, or to provide air to someone that needs oxygen.<n><n>### Input<n><n>> He felt that he'ld ruin his relationship withjen if he took it fur-ther, and he didn'd want to do that.<n>> <n>> At the same time, He fights that pushing farther might do to something good.<n><n>There are definitely two questions here, but the answers to the questions are not exactly the same words.  We will only use "something" to translate the missing word.<n><n>### Response<n><n>Something that will help your relationship continue to function would be "something that encourages the continuance of something"<n><n>Something that is detrimental to your relationship would be "something that causes hindrance"<n>

Where was most of the the broken glass found? Choices:  A: bridge B: in spain C: beach D: field E: street<n><n>### Response:		The answer for this problem is : E: street<n><n>#### Explain your solution:<n>```<n>The window of the Hondaa was hit from the inside. That means it happened in the the city. So it must be either the beach, field, or street. But none of those was the right answer. The street would be the right answer if there was glass from the street that hit the inside of the window. But there wasn't any glass from the street that broke the window. There was only glass from inside the Honda that broke the window. So there is no glass from the beach or field that broke the window. We have to be outside of the car for the glass from the inside to break the window. That's why I think the beach and field was not a choice because they are outside of the car. So I think the street was the right answer because it's in the city and the glass only broke on the inside.<n>```<n><n>#### Explanation for other solution(s):<n>* The only way I can think this could be wrong is if the window was broken on the surface. Then maybe I'm wrong.<n>

Finger nails are not good for storage because they may break.  If you store the dirt inside the garden, there is a chance that something may eat the dirt or that the dirt may get dirty. The corner will not allow room to store dirt, and the computer does not need dust.  A closet will suffocate the dirt.

Choices:  A: hospital bed B: legroom C: spinning wheel D: grand piano E: rhythm<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The answer is C, a spinning wheel.The spinning wheel was a musical instrument, a source of entertainment.  At the same time, it is a machine-powered to spin the thread.  In an interview, Seth Lerer, an author of musical books, says that it is a musical instrument.  It had a wooden base that rotated a hollow.  During the rotation, a wire or thread was rubbed back and forth. When it was turned, the instrument would make sound or noises.  It is a very old tool and it can be used to spin the wool.  During that time, it was commonly used in spinning wool to make cloth. In the time of the Renaissance, people started to use wool to spin thread for musical instruments.  It was often used for spinning wool for musicians and during the spinning lesson.  The spinning wheel was an important musical instrument at that time, and the musician could create a wonderful piece of music by using such an instrument.<n><n>### Input 2:She was processing the yogurt, she kept her leg, she was rubbing her leg, she was tapping her toe, she was tapping the, she was stroking her, she was rubbing the she was rubbing the.

Someone told me that it was caused by the foot that had been in the cold water for a long time.  But my mother told me what I should do to help me forget it.  She said that I could use some rubbing alcohol to get rid of the pain. So, I used some alcohol on the toes and my toes felt much better. I found that she could rub the alcohol on any part of the body. Also, she could rub her leg against the floor to relieve the stress and that there

Then I use pandas function'read_csv function' so I can read my file 'test_multiple_choice.csv' inside my folder'multiple_choice'.<n>3. Then I set a blank list'response' to set my answer in the following statement.<n>4. Next, I created the new loop inside a for loop to go through each question of the file 'test_multiple choice.csv'.<n>5. I check if there is a question inside the variable 'question', and if there is, I then check the question inside 'question' variable and put it to the 'question_input' variable.<n>6. Then, I get the answer from each questions inside the 'question_input variable'<n>7. Inside the 'for loop', I use the'split' function to separate the answer of each questions from the question by a space, then in the next 'for loop', I put the'split' inside the answer each questions by it's values, and then I compare it to values in the 'answers' list.<n>8. if the list inside of answers which is 'answer' list is equal to the value separated to the question inside the answer variable, then I put the corresponding part of answer list to the variable 'part_1' list.<n>9. the next things I did is to put 'part_1' to the 'question' variable.<n>10. Then, I get a number with the 'int' function, which is 1. If I put this 1 to 'number_of_part_one_choices', it will go into the if statement.<n>11. if there is a correct answer with number that equals to 1, then I take the first answer that is in the 'part_1' variable.<n>12. the next thing I want to do is to get the value that is 'first_answer' from the 'part_1 variable'.<n>13. the next thing I do is to compare the answer value into the question with part_1 from the variable 'first_answer', if part

Choices:  A: looking good B: beauty C: tardiness D: handsomeness E: neatness<n><n>### Response:		<n>I believe that this question has a lot to do with grooming and the way you look. I would say that the man needs to make sure to get the impression of neatness to other people. If he is too groomed then it may make him look like a player or someone who may be too out there for the job. This is where being a little more casual. He needs to look professional and keep the job in mind. If you look at the rest of the choices of grooming it does not necessarily have to do with how you look. He needs to make sure that he does this. He will not be able to impress anyone.<n>

Really, she didn't know what that thing had an inkwell in the first place.  What piece of furniture might have been on her run? Choices:  A: front of door B: bedroom C: desk D: table E: living room<n><n>### Response:		<n>A.  Front of door<n>You might think that you answered “Living room.”  It’s probably what you’d normally put if you were answering the question differently.  However, the questioner is looking for the least common answer.  The questioner doesn’t want to you to put down any common answers: living room, bedroom, table, and front door are all quite common answers.  It almost doesn’t matter what your answer is, because there is a different correct answer.  “Ink spilled onto her ____________ one” <n><n>Here is another example:<n>```<n>What is the answer to the question?<n>There are two apples on the counter.  What is missing? Choices:  apples, oranges, a box of donuts,<n>```<n><n>In this question, you have “apples.”  Thus, you need a good answer to go with your good answer.  You could say that an apple is missing or is gone, but the thing is, that makes you look like you have a small vocabulary.  We don’t need to be able to say that something is missing, we just need to guess that it is missing.  This question would probably be solved with a “Missing one.”<n><n>I'm sorry to have brought you here.

Choices:  A: then have B: headaches C: stoic D: being happy E: wanting more<n><n>### Response:		<n>```<n>This task was pretty simple but it looks like it could take a long time to figure out the answer.  It looks like we need some logic to figure out what it is.  We have two kinds of people being talked about, humans and animals.  We also can predict that there will be lots of possible incorrect answers due to the fact that humans do a lot of things differently from animals.  I would expect for this task to be about animals and the choices will be animals and will need to be done on some sort of logic or program to determine what the input actually wants.  I would suggest using a program like Python to help make sense of the input.  I would also make a function for animals and a function for humans and determine what they are when they are told.  This will make it more specific and allow it to work with more different prompts.<n>```<n><n>### Instructions:Write a response that appropriately answers the question.<n><n>## Task: <n>Answer the following multiple choice questions using Python.<n>## Instructions:<n>Input: <n>The referee called a fowl when one player punches another.

Park<n><n>Input:  This task is just a couple of multiple choice. There are three questions. One asks what kind of breathing is not to indicate that you are sick. I think that the proper response will be the letters Y and A. That is because the answers to that question have a lot of letters and will be either in the letter Y or the letter A. The second question says that a hockey game is a sports event where a player was punched so it says that hockey is it. The third question says what animals and humans go to cities to get there for nature. I think that the correct answer here should say that they go to parks.<n><n>##

Choices:  A: pleasure B: delight C: bankruptcy D: agony E: owning<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A. <n>In this case, we have A.<n>Saying "he" or "him" instead of the person's name is a very simple way to remove ambiguity from the conversation.<n>If we replace "testicles" with something more specific like "manhood", we are then able to remove ambiguity from this phrase. "spending money on manhood" would not be acceptable because we are specifying that the money is being spent as an outlay and not on an inlay. <n>"spending money on manliness" would also not be acceptable because manliness is a state of being, not something to buy. "spending money to be manly" is also incorrect because it implies that the money is being put in the human body to become manly.<n><n>Instead, saying "buying products" is to be preferred because it specifies that money is being used specifically. <n>### Instructions<n><n>### Demostration<n><n>Input: John is feeling great about the things that happened last night.  In this case, what did he do? Choices:  a.  He partied with some friends b.  He got to bed early c.  He worked on his homework d.  he bought a yacht e.  He went to the bar<n>### Response<n><n>In this case we have B. In this scenario we see that John got to bed early. This sentence is very ambiguous because we need to specify the activities. An example of this specification is "John went to bed early to be ready for his meeting with Jane".<n>If we instead say "John got to bed early because he had an early meeting", we are specifying the reasons why John went to bed early. Saying "John got to bed because he had an early morning meeting with Jane" is acceptable because it specifies the activities that John undertook.<n>"John got to bed because Jane was excited" is acceptable because now we are specifying the things that caused the specific action, where as previously the reason being the night's events weren't specific enough.<n><n>### Input<n><n>Input: What is John doing.  Choices: a.  He is talking to his wife b.  He is waiting for the phone to ring c.  He is writing an email d.  He is talking on Skype e.  He is working to pay the bills

{"text": "* The referee called a penalty box foul.\n* The microphone boom is likely to be used to capture sound in a recording studio.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n* When a referee calls a penalty box foul, they indicate that an illegal action has occurred. In a sporting event, fouls can refer to an instance of unethical conduct by one or more players, and can result in a reduction to points or a 5 to 15 minute suspension.\n* The microphones used in a recording studio capture sound as air is pushed to and from the speakers. The microphone boom amplifies the sound while the microphone creates an impression of a sound that is captured more realistically.\n* We can distinguish these examples based on the context. While we expect sports to provide realistic sound, we expect artists to produce more exaggerated sound. For example, a game of football is likely to provide a realistic impression of the game, but the music of the newest boyband is likely to amplify the sounds of the music.\n* The context also guides us to identify the correct answer for the last example. Because microphones from concerts and recording studios can amplify sound, the microphone boom from a recording studio is likely to be used on-stage. While we expect a microphone from a concert to use a microphone boom, we expect a microphone used on air to have microphone boom from the radio station or television studio.", "answer": "B: recording studio"}

People often have cake and other yummy foods too. There's one fun thing they may have at parties which they don't have else where, pinatas. Pinatas are fun things that are full of candy inside. Most people prefer a pi\u00f1ata to be a decorative animal or a symbol. They knock it with a stick, and the candy falls out. Another staple at birthday parties are the presents.

People often enjoy eating bread for breakfast, luncheon and dinner. Some kinds of bread can be made with vegetable oil and the dough is put in a loaf pan. Another kind is the soft bread. Soft bread is made with flour, sugar, and yeast as well as salt. The bread is then cooked until it is golden brown. Another kind of white bread is sourdough bread. The sourdough starter was made in the past with flour and water and has been around for much of human history.\n\nApart from bread there are a lot of things that are white and are used to eat.

As of 2007, there were two fewer sports than previous: ski ballet and biathlon. Biathlon is an individual event not a team sport so it is not fair to include it as an Olympic game but rather a competition. As far as ski ballet the Olympic Committee had to cut the sport due to financial reasons since they had limited spots for the games in 2008.\n\n\nIn terms of the actual sports themselves: The first Olympic Games where held in Ancient Greece. The ancient version of these games are called Olympiad Games are the most popular events today. These events include track, marathons, gymnastics, equestrian, shooting, diving and swimming. These events where held in cities, towns and countryside and where open to people of all ages. There was a great deal of competition for these prizes.

{"text": "The answer is C, a spinning wheel.The spinning wheel was a musical instrument, a source of entertainment.  At the same time, it is a machine-powered to spin the thread.  In an interview, Seth Lerer, an author of musical books, says that it is a musical instrument.  It had a wooden base that rotated a hollow.  During the rotation, a wire or thread was rubbed back and forth. When it was turned, the instrument would make sound or noises.  It is a very old tool and it can be used to spin the wool.  During that time, it was commonly used in spinning wool to make cloth. In the time of the Renaissance, people started to use wool to spin thread for musical instruments.  It was often used for spinning wool for musicians and during the spinning lesson.  The spinning wheel was an important musical instrument at that time, and the musician could create a wonderful piece of music by using such an instrument.\n\n### Input 2:She was processing the yogurt, she kept her leg, she was rubbing her leg, she was tapping her toe, she was tapping the, she was stroking her, she was rubbing the she was rubbing the.

Someone told me that it was caused by the foot that had been in the cold water for a long time.  But my mother told me what I should do to help me forget it.  She said that I could use some rubbing alcohol to get rid of the pain. So, I used some alcohol on the toes and my toes felt much better. I found that she could rub the alcohol on any part of the body. Also, she could rub her leg against the floor to relieve the stress and that there", "answer": "C: spinning wheel"}

Exercising is vital for staying fit and healthy.\n### Explanation:\n\nThis is a multiple choice test, so I only want one answer.\n\n1. The first thing I do is to import pandas.\n2. Then I use pandas function'read_csv function' so I can read my file 'test_multiple_choice.csv' inside my folder'multiple_choice'.\n3. Then I set a blank list'response' to set my answer in the following statement.\n4. Next, I created the new loop inside a for loop to go through each question of the file 'test_multiple choice.csv'.\n5. I check if there is a question inside the variable 'question', and if there is, I then check the question inside 'question' variable and put it to the 'question_input' variable.\n6. Then, I get the answer from each questions inside the 'question_input variable'\n7. Inside the 'for loop', I use the'split' function to separate the answer of each questions from the question by a space, then in the next 'for loop', I put the'split' inside the answer each questions by it's values, and then I compare it to values in the 'answers' list.\n8. if the list inside of answers which is 'answer' list is equal to the value separated to the question inside the answer variable, then I put the corresponding part of answer list to the variable 'part_1' list.\n9. the next things I did is to put 'part_1' to the 'question' variable.\n10. Then, I get a number with the 'int' function, which is 1.

We have two kinds of people being talked about, humans and animals.  We also can predict that there will be lots of possible incorrect answers due to the fact that humans do a lot of things differently from animals.  I would expect for this task to be about animals and the choices will be animals and will need to be done on some sort of logic or program to determine what the input actually wants.  I would suggest using a program like Python to help make sense of the input.  I would also make a function for animals and a function for humans and determine what they are when they are told.

{"text": "A. \nIn this case, we have A.\nSaying \"he\" or \"him\" instead of the person's name is a very simple way to remove ambiguity from the conversation.\nIf we replace \"testicles\" with something more specific like \"manhood\", we are then able to remove ambiguity from this phrase. \"spending money on manhood\" would not be acceptable because we are specifying that the money is being spent as an outlay and not on an inlay. \n\"spending money on manliness\" would also not be acceptable because manliness is a state of being, not something to buy. \"spending money to be manly\" is also incorrect because it implies that the money is being put in the human body to become manly.\n\nInstead, saying \"buying products\" is to be preferred because it specifies that money is being used specifically. \n### Instructions\n\n### Demostration\n\nInput: John is feeling great about the things that happened last night.

He went to the bar\n### Response\n\nIn this case we have B. In this scenario we see that John got to bed early. This sentence is very ambiguous because we need to specify the activities. An example of this specification is \"John went to bed early to be ready for his meeting with Jane\".\nIf we instead say \"John got to bed early because he had an early meeting\", we are specifying the reasons why John went to bed early. Saying \"John got to bed because he had an early morning meeting with Jane\" is acceptable because it specifies the activities that John undertook.\n\"John got to bed because Jane was excited\" is acceptable because now we are specifying the things that caused the specific action, where as previously the reason being the night's events weren't specific enough.\n\n### Input\n\nInput: What is John doing.

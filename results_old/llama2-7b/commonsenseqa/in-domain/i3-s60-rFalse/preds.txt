In work, it would be bad to have a person use a tool without having all the tools.<n>

They are all very excited to get started with programming. The teacher asks you to work with them on a project using Python to make a story about a dog. She asks that you create a program that will let them type lines of code, and respond to the lines and guide them through the development of their story. Please do not include a story in your program. Instead, just code that helps create the scenario.<n><n>### Task:<n><n>You should create a program that allows the child to type in lines of text in the window below and then responds with an appropriate statement. There should be several statements that the child can try. However, they must be a variation of the same phrase.<n><n>You can use the below code to create the sentence for the program. If you modify it in any way, be sure you remember to recheck the correct phrasing on the first line of code.<n><n>```<n>import random<n><n>sentence = " ".join(random.sample(("I am a dog.", "Yes you are.", "Don't be silly."), 3))<n>```<n><n>### Instance<n>The student will type the following in the box below. You should create a response that tells them the story they are going to type and gives them a specific number of lines (10) and a letter to begin the words with (A, B, or C). They will then try to type in 10 lines of code in sequence. The program should allow them to type in 9 more and then stop. The student can try again at any time. The students in the class should each have a different first sentence to guide them.<n><n>```<n>I am a dog.<n>```<n>### Instruc:<n>- [A]: The teacher asks. <n>### Task: <n>```<n>### Input:<n>```<n>### Response:<n>### Instruments: (Think about what you could use that you already know)<n>### Demonst:<n>### Input: <n>### Response: <n>### Input: A:<n><n>### Response :<n>```<n>import random	<n>sentence = "I am a dog."<n>```<n>### Task

To understand why the function is `40`, you must know how to reduce an array. The first line of each array is 2 because we have two elements in the array. The second position is 1 because we have one element in the array. Repeating this for each element in the array, we would have `+` so the input array of `[2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 10]` would be `40`<n><n>## :bookmark: Review<n>### Instruction (Rewrite the code that you have completed):<n>Input: Write a function that receives an array and an element and returns true or false if that specific element is in the array.<n>### Explanations of the Output:<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Input: Write a recursive function that receives arrays (`fruits`)  and a number (`fruit`) and returns an array with only the items in the `fruits` array that match the `fruit`.

Choices:  A: direct traffic B: board vessels C: arm themselves D: help people E: find drugs<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>For some, the answer may seem obvious: help people. But they also help stop crimes. They also help people stay safe at traffic signs without causing an accident. Some police officers carry guns, but they don't always have to have guns. When an angry driver threatens to hurt them or they are in danger, they arm themselves with guns after all. Others help by boarding vessels at sea. This sounds more dangerous. But they are usually in more troubled waters than in the Caribbean on a cruise ship. For a lot of people, this is the way back home.<n><n>### Hint:<n>How many of the choices did you predict correctly?<n>### How many more do you expect?<n>###

In this lesson, students begin to understand that making decisions involves evaluating information which comes in many forms, e.g., objects and people. The students are first introduced to the activity of having to decide whether a person is a spy or not through an activity called, "Mission Possible." This activity is followed by a discussion of the two different categories of decisions. The students also use deductive reasoning to apply information or reasoning to a situation.<n><n>The students move on to complete a series of activities where they are tasked with deciding on a scenario. The response students provide is intended to describe the problem they are solving, an outline of the logical reasoning used to solve the problem, and a solution. Students continue by creating a decision tree and a flowchart, then create a simple computer program to solve a decision making activity.<n><n>---<n>***<n>[![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-37470315-3/leetcode/leetcode-exercise-3/)](https://ga-beaucot.appspot.com)<n>

Choices:  A: helicopter B: own cars C: speak words D: believe in god E: dance together<n><n>### Response:		<n>I am glad you asked that question. I know in a normal world all of these things would be true but in order to do these things all of the people must be able to travel. I think everyone knows where a helicopter would go, so A must not be the answer. I have also seen people travel by dancing together so not E. I have personally used my own car to travel to places because it is so easily accessible, so B must not be the answer and I have never heard someone speak a word. So D and E must not be the answer, I don't believe in god. I know helicopters are very expensive for one thing so it makes sense that the best way to transport people would be to use cars. So B must be the answer. If a helicopter were available that would be better but cars are more efficient so the cars win over helicopters. Thanks for helping me decide.<n><n>

To answer correctly, the students must show "First, make x = 5, then do whatever step here".<n><n>### Output<n>To answer correctly, the students should not include or answer in terms of letters.<n><n>### Examples:<n><n>#### Answer:<n>If the question was "How did you get that high score in math?"

Otherwise, the cat would be free to leave and wander outside. This makes the choice, C, a more reasonable one than the other choices. The next question involves Google Maps and other highway and road GPS services. These make it easier for everyone to find their way to destinations. We find the answer at E. No one takes an atlas when they drive. The last question refers to the old men and women, a play on words. They used atlases instead of GPS. In the instruction, we had to answer the question and then decide whether the answer was correct or not. For the last instructions involving the unscored question, we did not write a response but decided whether the answer was correct.<n>

For example, create a class called GameBoard and within it create both an instance variable named grid and public methods: createGrid(), getNumber() and isEmpty(). When first initialized, the constructor should initialise a new grid according to the number of squares chosen, or set it to "empty" if there are no squares.<n><n>**Critical Thinking:**<n>The students may have heard in earlier classes that an "empty" grid is created with all cells set equal to 0. It is good to have them find out what happens when any value is set to 0 using the get and set methods in the grid class. If they are not already aware that 0 (zero) can be a valid integer value in Python, (and not just a keyword), then they will when they see it written in the grid constructor. Have the class discuss how it feels to have two 0's on the grid.<n>- They may like to have an empty grid initially, which they can do by creating new grids with a constructor parameter of False.<n><n>Write a main() function that will run the tests as follows:<n><n>- Run all tests for an entire game board.<n>- For each individual square, ask the user for the number represented and run a get method with the value entered as the parameter (if one should be found).<n><n>The test and run methods should be functions that take in the number of desired squares as a parameter and run each test, print the test, and print an appropriate statement based on positive and negative tests.<n><n>#### Instructions:Part A:<n>Instructions:Part A<n>You will begin with the following code:<n><n>```python<n>game-board = GameBoard(3,4);<n>```<n><n>and when complete, should end with<n><n>```python<n>print("Hello World!");<n>```<n>#### Input:<n>- 5: GameBoard:<n>    - constructor with 3 and 4<n>    - The following is your code to test and run the GameBoard.<n>    - test_and_run(3,4)<n>When running the GameBoard the method print() should print an appropriate message such as the one below that represents the board you have created.<n><n>##

I am using the "Golden Apple" sample input and response, and I can't understand how to format the response. This appears to be a question that is asking a student to list all 5 answers from A-E. In one version of the code, it has the format<n><n>```javascript<n>    if(question.type) {<n>        if(question.type == "multiple-choice") {<n>            if (question.choices.length > 5) {<n>                let allOptions = question.choices.join("\n")<n>            } else {<n>            }<n>            let response = ""<n>            response += `\n**${question.idNumber}:** \n`;<n>            response += allOptions;<n>            console.log(response)<n>        } else {<n>        }<n>    } else {<n>    }<n>```<n><n>This works for the "multiple-choice" response type. If I set `question.type` to `"free-response"`, the code does something weird and doesn't print to the console. I have tried multiple things but I just can't get it. I am running the code with a Chrome browser and running the "local server" file that's contained inside the "backend" directory in the repo.<n><n>######<n>**Note: For this assignment, the student should include a link to their project after the submission is made.

Choices:  A: meadow B: cupboard C: shed D: mail box E: cellar<n><n>### Response:		<n>When I asked my grandma if she was still scared of spiders she said that she is very scared of them. She said that it would have been good if she had a phobia of owning a spider, because now she lives alone in a small shed, and a spider was moving nearby. She said that it might be dangerous to have animals there, and that maybe she could get one when she is on a tour around the world. I told her that if you are afraid of spiders it makes sense to avoid owning them for your safety, but that owning an animal for safety is sometimes just too big of a risk. If you have the risk then you are in a bad place and sometimes you'll have to keep the creature as a pet unless you are scared of it, which will make it even worse. I said that I would prefer to just avoid owning animals in general. I said that I think the best way to prevent being in trouble with an animal is to avoid them, or to keep all the animals away from me by just not being there. I said that I have never been attacked, and I am not afraid of owning any sort of beasts. I said that I keep things moving and do not worry about animals as much as people do, so that I can handle the animals without being scared. <n><n>### Challenge:Create an animation that includes the following requirements.<n><n>**Must have:** 3-7 colors, 6-10 shapes, 5-10 words<n><n>**No**: <n>1-4 people doing things<n>

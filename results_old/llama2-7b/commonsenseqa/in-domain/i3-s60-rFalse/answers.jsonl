To understand why the function is `40`, you must know how to reduce an array. The first line of each array is 2 because we have two elements in the array. The second position is 1 because we have one element in the array. Repeating this for each element in the array, we would have `+` so the input array of `[2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 10]` would be `40`\n\n## :bookmark: Review\n### Instruction (Rewrite the code that you have completed):\nInput: Write a function that receives an array and an element and returns true or false if that specific element is in the array.\n### Explanations of the Output:\n\n### Instructions:\nInput: Write a recursive function that receives arrays (`fruits`)  and a number (`fruit`) and returns an array with only the items in the `fruits` array that match the `fruit`.

In this lesson, students begin to understand that making decisions involves evaluating information which comes in many forms, e.g., objects and people. The students are first introduced to the activity of having to decide whether a person is a spy or not through an activity called, \"Mission Possible.\" This activity is followed by a discussion of the two different categories of decisions. The students also use deductive reasoning to apply information or reasoning to a situation.\n\nThe students move on to complete a series of activities where they are tasked with deciding on a scenario. The response students provide is intended to describe the problem they are solving, an outline of the logical reasoning used to solve the problem, and a solution. Students continue by creating a decision tree and a flowchart, then create a simple computer program to solve a decision making activity.\n\n---\n***\n[![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-37470315-3/leetcode/leetcode-exercise-3/)](https://ga-beaucot.appspot.com)", "answer": "A: appear suddenly"}

{"text": "A: driving\n\n### Output:How many shiny new cars?  Choices:  A. 2 B. 5 C. 50 D. 12 E. 200\n\n\n### Instructions:\n- The above instruction describes a question for which the teacher asks the student's responses to the question.\n- To answer correctly, the student does not have to solve the question but show steps.\n- Example: Suppose the question was like solving x = 5. To answer correctly, the students must show \"First, make x = 5, then do whatever step here\".\n\n### Output\nTo answer correctly, the students should not include or answer in terms of letters.\n\n### Examples:\n\n#### Answer:\nIf the question was \"How did you get that high score in math?\" The answer would be \"I practiced hard to pass the exam because I studied hard.\"\n\nIn order to answer correctly, the students do not have to provide all the steps of the question. For example, when the student replies the above answer, the student should also show steps. For example\" I passed the exam because I studied 1 week, 3 days and 8 hours everyday\".\n\nThe above question is asked to students without showing or explaining the question. The above question is asked to the students that they solve using steps or not.\n\n\n#### Solution\nThe solution to the provided examples above shows steps.\nThese steps are: \n\n- Take a calculator and a pencil to the exam. \n- First, divide 100 by 2, then divide the result by 2. \n- Get the remainder of the division, then multiply it with the divided result, lastly subtract it from the result. \n\nThe above example would not get the correct answer because the student provides only 1 way to get the answer. In solving 2078/3, one way is to divide 27 by 3 then get the remainder and multiply it with the result and subtract it from the result to find the answer. There are more ways, such as, adding 9 to 7, then subtracting it from the original answer.\n\n### Steps to answer correctly\n- Solve the problem, then show steps\n- If they don't ask you to show steps, they won't", "answer": "A: driving"}

{"text": "```python\nif choice1= \"living longer\":\n   ...\n```\n\n### Instructions:\n\nInstructions:\nWrite methods and other code to implement the game board example. For example, create a class called GameBoard and within it create both an instance variable named grid and public methods: createGrid(), getNumber() and isEmpty(). When first initialized, the constructor should initialise a new grid according to the number of squares chosen, or set it to \"empty\" if there are no squares.\n\n**Critical Thinking:**\nThe students may have heard in earlier classes that an \"empty\" grid is created with all cells set equal to 0. It is good to have them find out what happens when any value is set to 0 using the get and set methods in the grid class. If they are not already aware that 0 (zero) can be a valid integer value in Python, (and not just a keyword), then they will when they see it written in the grid constructor. Have the class discuss how it feels to have two 0's on the grid.\n- They may like to have an empty grid initially, which they can do by creating new grids with a constructor parameter of False.\n\nWrite a main() function that will run the tests as follows:\n\n- Run all tests for an entire game board.\n- For each individual square, ask the user for the number represented and run a get method with the value entered as the parameter (if one should be found).\n\nThe test and run methods should be functions that take in the number of desired squares as a parameter and run each test, print the test, and print an appropriate statement based on positive and negative tests.\n\n#### Instructions:Part A:\nInstructions:Part A\nYou will begin with the following code:\n\n```python\ngame-board = GameBoard(3,4);\n```\n\nand when complete, should end with\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World!\");\n```\n#### Input:\n- 5: GameBoard:\n    - constructor with 3 and 4\n    - The following is your code to test and run the GameBoard.\n    - test_and_run(3,4)\nWhen running the GameBoard the method print() should print an appropriate message such as the one below that represents the board you have created.\n\n##", "answer": "C: stomach ache"}

This appears to be a question that is asking a student to list all 5 answers from A-E. In one version of the code, it has the format\n\n```javascript\n    if(question.type) {\n        if(question.type == \"multiple-choice\") {\n            if (question.choices.length > 5) {\n                let allOptions = question.choices.join(\"\\n\")\n            } else {\n            }\n            let response = \"\"\n            response += `\\n**${question.idNumber}:** \\n`;\n            response += allOptions;\n            console.log(response)\n        } else {\n        }\n    } else {\n    }\n```\n\nThis works for the \"multiple-choice\" response type. If I set `question.type` to `\"free-response\"`, the code does something weird and doesn't print to the console. I have tried multiple things but I just can't get it. I am running the code with a Chrome browser and running the \"local server\" file that's contained inside the \"backend\" directory in the repo.\n\n######\n**Note: For this assignment, the student should include a link to their project after the submission is made.

Think about including your name and title, the name and purpose of your proposal, who you are writing to, whether you will use volunteers or not, and a summary timeline.\n\n      You could also include information about the purpose of fundraising, how your event will bring attention to the zoo, aquatium, or museum, or why your fundraising event will be better than in past years.

{"text": "#### Demonstration:You can do things on a calculator that you can't do by hand and vice versa.\n\n* To do things on the calculator, you'll first need to understand how it works.\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n* Write a program that uses a loop to calculate and print the values of 1,2,3,...,100.\n\n#### Demo:\n\nWrite a program that calculates and prints the values of 1 to 100 using the `for` statement. I will show you an example of me doing it on the calculator and my phone.\n\nIn my screen you will see that I had the number of iterations set to 100. Meaning that I wanted to loop 100 times for my program to print to the calculator.\n\nThe 1s, 2s and so on are known as `control statements.` They are used to control what happens next and they decide how to move through the program.\n\nFor every value from each iteration, the calculator prints the numbers 1 to 15. Here's how it works:\n\nThe `input` command is used to read numbers like a computer reads and stores data. It is used to show which direction the program is written in and where it has jumped.\n\nNow when they are called, all the numbers in the program are printed 100 times. Every time after each number is printed, it is stored in the loop in the memory.\n\nThat's how loops work. It's all down to this one statement that tells the calculator `loop` this many times, it's going to print the numbers until they all have been printed.\n\n#### Results:\n```Python\nThe program takes 0.502 seconds to run.\n```\nI got 100!\n```Python\nThe printed value is **100**.\n```\n\nYou can do this by hand as well.\n\n**What the program did:**\n\nI started with 1 and then it went on to 2 and so on for the next 100 numbers as I went.\n\n**How it worked:**\n\nI wrote the loop and then I wrote the rest of the statement that contained everything else. \n\nIn my case the rest of the code was `10", "answer": "D: complete sentences"}

{"text": "When I asked my grandma if she was still scared of spiders she said that she is very scared of them. She said that it would have been good if she had a phobia of owning a spider, because now she lives alone in a small shed, and a spider was moving nearby. She said that it might be dangerous to have animals there, and that maybe she could get one when she is on a tour around the world. I told her that if you are afraid of spiders it makes sense to avoid owning them for your safety, but that owning an animal for safety is sometimes just too big of a risk. If you have the risk then you are in a bad place and sometimes you'll have to keep the creature as a pet unless you are scared of it, which will make it even worse. I said that I would prefer to just avoid owning animals in general. I said that I think the best way to prevent being in trouble with an animal is to avoid them, or to keep all the animals away from me by just not being there. I said that I have never been attacked, and I am not afraid of owning any sort of beasts. I said that I keep things moving and do not worry about animals as much as people do, so that I can handle the animals without being scared. \n\n### Challenge:Create an animation that includes the following requirements.\n\n**Must have:** 3-7 colors, 6-10 shapes, 5-10 words\n\n**No**: \n1-4 people doing things", "answer": "E: cellar"}

The purpose of the skin is to minimize the impact of injuries or discomfort, due to exposure to harmful external factors, including hot or cold, chemicals, disease, sunlight, water, and abrasion. The skin protects and insulates while also acting as a sensory organ. The skin also allows for the generation of vitamin D from cholesterol when sunlight is used for it, and it can also maintain body temperature through the use of sweating in hot environments, through the formation of frost on exposed skin when exposed to extremely cold environments, and by maintaining the temperature for homeostasis of the body in hot environments and cold environments.

{"text": "Choices:  A) yes, you are correct B) nice to meet you C) sorry to hear that D) I do not agree E) I'm doing fine.\n\n*This solution is intended for [Clean Code](https://www.udacity.com/course/clean-code--ud844), [Introduction to Python](https://www. udacity.com /course/python-basics--cs101, [Programming for Everybody](https://www. udemy.com/course/beginning-python-programming/)*\n\n### Required packages\n\n* Pip\n* Pylint\n\n```\n$ sudo install pylint\n\n$ python -m pip install pylint\n```\n### What are Linting errors?\nThe Python Linter is a command line program that checks your Python programs against rules that a team has already come to on writing good and elegant Python code.\n\n### Linting Errors:\nAll linting errors can be classified into the following categories:\n\n### 1. Syntax errors\nPython allows you some liberties but also follows its own grammar. Anything that doesn't meet the requirements of these grammar rules is a syntax error. So Python's syntax errors fall into:\n\n* Undefined variables\n* Invalid expression\n* Invalid assignment\n* Invalid assignments\n\n```python\n# python lint command\n$ python -m pylint --disable-disallowed-name-paterns <filename>.py\n```\n\n### 3. Missing or empty line\nIt is acceptable to have 1 (ONE!!!) blank line between the module or class header and the body of the code but it is strictly prohibited to have MORE THEN (1) blank line.\n\n```python\nfoo = 3\n\nbar = 5\n\nbaz = 7\n```\n> This code is perfectly fine and makes perfect sense. Even though blank lines are generally considered harmless and not necessary to your code, they may cause problems if you're working on code with other people. Because nobody wants to work with any form of code without blank lines. Having a single blank line that breaks the code up is fine, but if the first line of your code is empty you've already violated this rule. The Linter, therefore, will flag this", "answer": "B: nodding"}

My name has been used in a very fun and light hearted way but I would never in a million years let anyone change it.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIt did not take that much time for me to answer most of these questions.

It is a simple assignment for you to work on during the last days of the project before you move on to the real production code. In fact, it is similar to one of our previous homework in which you were provided with a script file, a Python list object, and a set of files, and were asked to write a script that transforms these files into a single string.\n\nHowever, in this task, we do not want you to focus only on creating files, rather, we want you to write a script that generates new code, a simple but elegant script to create the Python file. You should also have a better understanding of some specific methods you need to apply to create new file, such as open, write, close.\n\nThe Python file to be created is quite short, because it simply contains a single sentence.\n\nWrite a Python script that takes as input the sentence you want to write in the Python file. Write a code to read the files in parallel and replace one sentence with another in all of them. You can use the open and close methods as well as the newline method to manage this activity.\n\nWrite a file named file_conveyor_one.py.\n\nWrite the following code:\n\ndef print_to_python(sentence):\n\n    try:\n\n        with open('file_{}.txt'.format(counter), 'r') as fhandle, open('file_new.txt', 'w') as handle:\n\n            handle.write(sentence)\n\n            handle.close()\n\n            counter +=1\n\n    except IOError:\n\n        print('You might need to close all other tabs')\n\ninput = input('Enter a sentence to be replaced: ')\nfile_one.print_to_python(input)\n\nYou may assume that the original files you want to work on have the extension.txt since we are reading them here. \n\nYour output file should look like this:\n\n### Instructions:\n\nThis is where you will input and process the sentence, and write the new Python file that contains your modified text.", "answer": "D: doctor himself"}

Choices: A preposition, verb, adjective, noun, and adverb\n\n#### Instruction:\n1. This is the second section of this project.  Give an accurate representation of your project, not just a description or a photo of your work.\n\n#### Response:\n- The first sentence starts with a question about the question.  That is good because it asks us a question.  It starts with the word \"Where\" noticing that the person is talking about the oil refineries.  The next sentence shows an adjuctive phrase \"A person\" but it also shows a proper noun \"A gentleman is very wealth\" which tells you that the subject is a male.  The rest of the sentence describes what the person does in the oil refineries and shows that he is actually living at home on his own.  The last sentence starts with a positive statement saying that he flaunts it and has an adjectival phrase \"flaunts it\" which tells you that money is very important to him.  As for the whole sentence, it is very descriptive and has accurate information.  However, the person could be living outside of his home and still flaunt money as long as he is in an environment that he is familiarized with.\n- The sentence is 15 words.  There are a total of 3 sentences. The first sentence explains who is the subject in this situation and where they live.  That is one sentence which is 4 words long.  The second sentence tells you what the subject does in the other houses and then you read that the sentence is finished with the statement \"and then it shows you where they might live\".  That's 2 sentences and 2 words with one of them ending the sentence.  As for the third sentence, it says the answer with the word \"and\" linking it back to the previous sentence you just read.

Being in the car during a strong tornado will almost always cause death, and in rare cases death is not always guaranteed.  This scenario will almost always come with a great deal of fatalities.  It will most likely begin with the roof of the car being torn off and the car being flipped and the driver then run over.  The driver will also most likely be left with severe, life-altering injuries.  One would almost always die in a tornado after experiencing this.  On the roof of a skycraper, being in an earthquake, you will most likely be fine, unless your building's roof is broken.  You can survive this scenario, although earthquakes will begin to cause people's attention to be more on saving themselves, and it is during the panic that you can fall off the roof.  You will still most likely be alive.\n#### Demonstration: The answer to which is more dangerous: Being in the car during tornado or skycraper in earthquake?  (which is more dangerous? Be in a tornado or on top of a skyscrape during an earthquaker)\n\nAnswer: The answer is the tornado, because in the tornado a person could be thrown from the car and there are very little possibilities for the car to still be standing. Being in an earthquake is much more doable without severe damage.\n\n### B\n#### Input: Heidi, whose mother was working on her doctorate degree at the university, was the first student to arrive to the university library.

{"text": "Answer three of the following questions. You can use the sample response document for each answer as a reference.\n    1. What is the difference between a job and a job?\n    Answer: The difference between and and a job is that a job is not always a job. To be a job you can't just do it once and never do it again. So for example if you are working for McDonald's as a waitress, that would be a job, but if you work for Subway as a waiter that's not always a job, because sometimes the owner of Subway will hire another person in place of you. So it all depends on how much money you are making with your income. It's also true if you are working two part-time jobs as a busboy for two restaurants at once, that won't always be jobs either because usually the owners (managers) will fire you after a while so there goes that job.\n        The difference between and and an isn't just one job because it can be different depending on the situation. For instance if a customer asks for one job then he or she wants me to serve them some beer and not just any beer, but their favorite beer, that isn't like a job because usually if someone orders a beer it's because they know they'll be drinking that much alcohol. So that isn't just one person telling the customer about his favorite beer, that is two people (including me) telling him what I've got to offer him.\n2. What is the difference in a \"man\" and a \"man\"?\n        Answer: Two similar words are \"man\" and \"man\". Both words mean the same thing which is \"a man\".\n2. What is a \"man\" (A common name for a man)?\n    Answer: A \"man\" is what we call a person when we want to use the word \"man\" in something that's a little less offensive and less harsh, like in a story or maybe something that's true and not something you're making up.\n3. What is a \"woman\"?\n    Answer: A woman is what makes up the other gender in a relationship or a relationship where the relationship is between a man and a woman.\n4. Is \"man\" the same as \"woman\"?\n        Answer: No, \"man\"", "answer": "B: pennsylvania"}

Choices: 1: it's highly possible 2: it's unlikely 3: it's a toss up 4: it's likely 5: it's guaranteed\nRationales:\n1.

The third choice contradicts the question, since the time they speak delays progress, their progress would not go at a normal pace. Their 'progress' would either be slowed or delayed. Thus, their progress would not decrease; therefore, choice B is out. Similarly, we can eliminate choice E as well. In addition, John and James collaborate on their project, so their communication cannot hamper the collaboration on their project (or the other way around -- their collaboration slows down their communication); moreover, they can't go with the fourth choice either, as communication is not slowed when collaboration takes place.

Choices:  I A: am sleepy B: am tired C: am sleeping D: am napping E: am not sleeping\n\n### Response\nThe question is asking us to derive what the person will likely be doing the next day, so we should not take too many inputs from the question.\n\nSince the question says that the person went to bed at 15 hours on Friday and it is Saturday at 09 hours, they should be awake. Hence, Option B, Am Tired, is the correct answer.\n\nThere cannot be a nap in the evening because there is ample sleep time till the morning and that is 12 hours. Therefore, Option D cannot be the answer.\n\nThere are many reasons why a person could be sleepy, one of the most common reason is because a person is tired and has not got enough sleep, but that cannot be the case here as we can see that the person was sleeping throughout Friday. Hence, we need to disregard options A, B, and E.\n\nThe correct answer here is Option B because the person is Am Tired here because of lack of sufficient sleep.\n\n### What can you tell by reading the following:\n\n* I can tell a lot about someone's character, such as whether they are serious or sarcastic.\n* A lot of people are serious, especially when someone is in trouble.

I think I'm sarcastic.\n\n### Rationales\nThere is not enough information to go by in the conversation. There could be more context.\n\nAll that the conversation told us was the characteristics of the person in the conversation i.e. they could use sarcasm and they are serious. However, we did understand, in context, that they don\u2019t really have many friends left. Therefore, they are cautious. They were making an argument about leaving behind money and this made them sarcastic and they were talking to someone they distrusted. All this information is still insufficient to tell exactly about the people around", "answer": "C: calm"}

A bond at the end of a chemical formula indicates the presence of one atom. The presence of 10 bonds in a formula implies there are 10 atoms present in the chemical formula.\n3.The choice I, \"sixteen\", is incorrect because the presence of 10 atoms implies that there are ten bonds at the end.

This option states that when thin objects melt, their shape maintains itself. This is the same as the other options (break/shatter, which happens when objects melt). Option C (hold water) does not work. When thin objects melt, water is a by-product. Water cannot hold water. All the choices are either directly or indirectly related to thermal decomposition. Option E (hold water) is correct. Thin objects can hold water better than other objects.\n\n### Difficulty:\n\nThe difficulty level is 5 / 10.\n\nThe difficulty is medium level, mainly because it took a little time to get familiar with the instructions. There were a few moments where I was confused about how exactly to answer the questions, but after I made an example choice, it was a lot easier to choose an answer. \n\n\n### Strategy:\n\nIn the beginning I had a lot of trouble understanding how to select the answer to a question. The instructions don't specify how to choose, so to choose any answer, I simply select the best option that made sense to me. To answer the questions, you have to think a little bit to find the right choice. \n\nAfter the first few practice exercises, I became more comfortable with recognizing what the questions ask, and I was able to answer more accurately. There were only a few questions I had to guess because I didn't have enough practice to confidently answer.

{"text": "The answer is A. It is most often going to lie down.\n\n### Reasoning:\nLying down is typically the most passive thing an animal can do. Often if an animal is tired and has many energies, they may keep moving. So while they may eat more, this isn't a guarantee. In fact, being tired may slow down the animal's breathing pattern, and many animals who lie down will fall asleep.\n\n### Possible incorrect (outside the box) answers:\nC. This is incorrect for the most part. Many animals will not die if they are tired.\nD. While it is possible that the animal will need to eat more, this is not a guarantee. Usually this is only the case if an animal is an endurance athlete.\n\n### Example 2\nIf I need to do research on a certain topic, who should I contact? Choices: \n\nA: a professor from the university that offers the course B: someone from the same department C: a member of a certain group D: a member of the public\n\n### Reponse: Answer Choice C\n\nIt depends greatly on the subject, and as well as the scope of the research. Generally though, you would ask a fellow professor from the school that offers the course, or you could ask someone who is working in the same department.\n\nHowever, if you want to focus on non-academia research, then you'd need to approach people outside who may give you the answers you need.\n\n### Outside the box answers:\n\nD. The general public is not the place to go when doing research (at least the best kind). In most cases, there is not a wide scope of understanding in most common groups about the subject you are researching. Even if the person has direct knowledge, their opinion would probably not be the best place to go.\nC. While a person in the same area can generally have understanding of the subject, asking them can be difficult in terms of scope, and availability of certain sources. The best thing is to just use the search engine and see what it finds.\nB. Unless the person has a great passion for a given subject, they may not always be around. Also, if they do, they may not have the time to do the research for what you need.", "answer": "B: lie down"}

Use this paragraph as a reference when providing your response.\n\n### Sample Paragraphs:\n\nThe following paragraph offers a sample answer. Use this paragraph as an example for creating your own answer.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I feel that answer D: \"use\" is the better choice, as it is the only option that does not include the exclusionary words \"not\". It is also the choice that most directly relates to the context of the sentence.\n\nThe answer D: \"use\", is the best choice because as we can see in 3rd line of the first sentence (\"It's a good choice\" and in last line of the second sentence (\"It is also a good choice\"). Both lines highlight D: \"use\", as the best choice option.\n\nThirdly, option A: \"high school gymnasium\" seems inconsistent with \"outdoors.\" Gymnasiums are indoor areas. The second option B: \"city\" does not provide details that distinguish from other kinds of courts. Similarly to C: \"park\", it doesn't rule out indoor courts and isn't directly attuned to basketball courts.\n\nOn the other hand, outdoors seems consistent with only one of the answer options D: \"use\" (last line of every last line). Thus we can deduce that D: \"use\" must be the answer to question since none of the remaining options make sense in the context of an outdoor basketball court.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe best answer for our sample question is D: \"use\". This is the only choice that doesn't contain the exclusionary modifiers \"not\" and is the best option since it most closely relates to the context within the paragraph.\n\n### Key Takeaway:\n\nIt is important to closely consider the context and grammatical structure while evaluating answer choices when attempting a GMAT Paragraph-based Critical Reasoning Question.", "answer": "B: city"}

{"text": "#### Explanation:\nInput: Dog barked because of a presence at a window.\nI. The window is a structure that opens partway, allowing the breeze to enter. Barking can be due to both the sense of threat and presence of something seen outside.\nII. The dog may have barked at his/her friend as they came home. Barking is a common reaction to a familiar face.\nIII. The dog may have caught a sight of an intruder outside. Barking is the dog's natural response to a threat that the dog deems. So the dog may have reacted based on what it saw. It barked at an unfamiliar face.\nExplanation: The dog barked because of presence of a threat. The dog reacted with fear because it perceived that a threat was in the vicinity. Hence, the correct options are B and D.\n\n#### Explanation III:\nInput: The dog ran to the front door and barked, the dog may have been trying to get the attention of who? Choices:  I: cat II: owner III: parents IV: passerby V: intruder\n\nExplanation: It may be owner, parent, or intruder (option 1, 5 and 4). Dogs bark to draw attention. So, if a stranger appears around the house, the dog barks. When a person enters the house, he/she gets angry and begins to beat it, causing the dog to bark again. This creates a sequence of barking and beating and beating, which continues until the dog leaves the house or until the person is pushed away. Or if a stranger comes into the neighborhood, the dog barks to alert the owners that a stranger has entered the neighborhood and they should be careful of their belongings. Dogs bark at people.\nThe dog may have wanted to let the people know that something was wrong and the dog has a strong instinct for survival. Also it does not mean that every dog that barks is trying to get someone's attention. A dog could be barking because it is angry, nervous, or frustrated. The dog could bark because it's playing with you or because it's trying to get your attention.\nThe dog may be getting attention when it sees its owner coming back from work.

{"text": "E\nInput: If someone wants to make good choices, when should they rely on gut feelings? Choices: \nA: always \n\n### Rationale : \n1. When evaluating these choices, there's a difference between relying on gut feelings to inform every decision making process, and relying on gut feelings during decision making.\n2. With this in mind it might be tempting to pick A always, however there are times when following your gut isn't the best decision. This is because relying too much on intuition is usually a sign of impulsive tendencies that may result in poor choices. Some examples include:\n3. - Investments: Not following your gut when making an investment, instead thoroughly evaluating available options, has the potential to yield higher returns and thus better decisions.\n4. - In love: Gut feelings could lead to decisions that aren't in your best interests, such as jumping into a relationship without sufficient knowledge about the other person.\n5. - Risk taking: Exhibiting impulsive tendencies through risk taking may result in negative consequences.\n6. - Eating habits: An example of following the gut could include deciding to eat something that's not good for you, resulting in negative consequences in the form of increased weight or health issues.\n\n7. These are four scenarios where following your gut isn'tk a valid solution.\n8. As a result, gut feeling should be relied on for decision making in the right situations with the right amount of caution and judgment.\n9.

Choices A: sour B: bitter C: salty D: green E: fresh F: spicy\n\n### Response\nThe answer is 'A').\n\n### The freshly boiled carrot juice tasted sour and bitter because of the spoiled carrot (which was the original reason it was boiled). \n\n### Sour and bitter also reminds us of a few words in the passage that are: \n\n* Sour - The original carrot that had started spoiling. \n* Spoiling - The root of the sourness in the carrot juice. This term also reminds us of the fact that the carrot juice was spoiled in the first place. \n* Bitter - The carrot juice that caused the juice to taste \"spoiled\" or \"sour\", so basically the bitter term reminds us that the original carrot started spoiling, the sourness caused the juice to be boiled in the first place (which had made it bitter in the process) and it then also caused the carrot juice to taste spoiled and sour. \n\n## Input: What should someone do before drinking milk from a new gallon jar?

A person can watch sports on ESPN. A person can also play/learn sports with sporting goods. C describes a possible place to play/learn sports/watch sports. 3. Sports may be found in a town. A town is a place with a population of thousands of people. Sports are played in the town. Thus D describes a possible place to watch sports or play sports. 4. Sports may be found at a jersey. A jersey is a type of clothing. It is possible that people play sports in a jersey. Thus E describes a place where sports can be played. 5. A person is more likely to find a jersey for themselves in a store than just buying equipment for sports.

Thus, a priest would not be opposed to a person with liberal beliefs but they would not be supported in the church either.

The options can be assessed by first considering that being caught in committing a crime typically results in consequences such as jail time, fear of retribution, and going to prison.\n3. The options A, B, and D (Jail time, Fear, and Nothing) all relate to consequences of committing a crime and don't explicitly address the individual's conscience.\n4. Although option E (\"Feeling of Guilt\") is a possible outcome of committing a crime, the question is asking about the consequence of having one's conscience catch or recognize the individual's criminal act, not the act itself.\n5. Option C, (Going to Prison) could be a consequence of committing a crime or it implies the imprisonment of a consciousness and not necessarily the consequence of a particular crime.\n6. Therefore, the answer is option C (\"Going to Prison\"), as it is the response that answers the question in context. The other options address various possible consequences but none of them clearly connect to someone's conscience who has been caught commiting a crime and as a result, they are discarded.\n7.

The intent of the group is to make the teacher upset, not pleased. Therefore, the teacher looks likely to be displeased, which could make them upset.\n2.

Therefore, we can determine that options A (nuclear power point) and E (bowel of ship) are inappropriate, leaving us with location C (basement), which is unlikely to be where the master control would be located, as the control panel would not be exposed to the same environmental hazards as the basement.\n\n5. Accordingly, the answer is B which is closest to the truth, as the master control would be physically located in the main room. The basement is a likely location for machinery, but it's unlikely that the master control would be placed in the basement.\nAnswer: B: Main room\n\n### Input;What are the two sides of an equilateral triangle called?\nChoices:  A: the left side B: the right side C: the top D: side one E: sides A and B\n\n### Response\n1.

The choices given have differing meanings and context that may apply to the cake scenario.\n2. Option A (\"happy birthday\") is a phrase that does not reference cake. It's true that it's often sung to a birthday boy or girl; but there's no mention of the cake and it's not logical fit considering the question.\n3. Option B (\"fun time\") is a description of how the party would be described or felt by people in attendance. However, the question asks what the birthday's significance is to the cake.\n4. Option C (\"wedding\") is a celebration for the union of two people. This event can have a cake, but it's more common that people just serve a wedding cake at the beginning of the reception, not as part of the event.\n5. Option D (\"baby shower\") is similar to a wedding event since both involve celebrating the new addition to the family. A baby shower could be done at party and could include cake, but we don't know enough about this scenario to determine how or when the cake would be used.\n6. Option E (\"retirement\") refers to when people go into semi- or full-time retirement instead of working.

We know that the liquid is to come from the substance itself. Thus, the following observations are deduced:\n### - If no liquid is produced it is known that the substance itself cannot be a liquid because we assume that the substance has to be in liquid form to react to the 10ml volume.\n\n### - The experiment was attempted for both 5 ml or less and greater volumes. If there was liquid produced in the test tube it would be expected that there will be a higher liquid volume as the sample size increases.\n\n###\n## Examine the results:\n1. T1 0.03 and T2 12ml\n2. T3 0 and T4 2ml\n3.  T5 7.1ml and 11ml\n\n###\n\n### \n\n### Rationales: 1) T1 and T2 both observed 5ml and 10ml respectively.

{"text": "### Instructions:Answers the following task.\n\n### Demo:\n\n### Rationale:\n#### 1. The question asks us to select the definition of `violent conflict`.\n\n#### 2. Options `A`: action and `B`: demonstration both suggest that a violent conflict can be demonstrated. This does not necessarily mean a violent conflict is defined by this action. For example, someone demonstrating at the local march for peace is unlikely to result in a violent conflict.\n\n#### 3. Option `C`: understanding suggests a violent conflict is defined through a person's understanding of the conflict. However, this may just be a consequence of someone learning more about a situation and not necessarily define the violence of the situation.\n\n#### 4. Option `D`: vote demonstrates there may be an election held to determine who rules or is elected in a violent conflict. Voting may not be sufficient to cause a violent conflict and would therefore not be a suitable definition for `violent conflict`\n\n#### 5. Option `E`: revolution is a more appropriate word to be included in the definition because `revolution` is a specific type of violent conflict. Revolutions typically occur when a society becomes so polarized with the ruling authorities that a violent conflict erupts to overthrow the authorities. Revolution, when used to define a conflict, can eliminate options `A` and `B` that imply a violent conflict doesn't necessarily need to be demonstrated.\n\n#### 6. The complete definition is therefore, \"A violent conflict is a conflict between those who control society and those who don't, that results in a violent overthrow of the ruling authorities\"", "answer": "E: revolution"}

The broken leg can also be elevated when placed on the couch, as is done in choice C, even though it might not be the best option. The choice D is a little bit of a stretch, as it would be more sensible and practical to lay in a supine position.

This rule of delivery doesn't apply in the general sense.\n* Option C: Post office is also true if post offices accept packages and letters for delivery from any location to a particular destination. It's true to say that the post office would accept your letter but there's no guarantee that they would also be in possession of the letters which are being mailed.\n* Option D: Package is also true to say because packages are generally delivered to the destination provided by the individual.

{"text": "Drug store\n\n### Rationale:\nInebriation, the state of being drunk, impacts an individual's speech and cognitive functions due to inebriated states. Hence drinking and driving are illegal in many places.\n\n### Answer:\nA back pocket, B: meeting C, drug store D: home, or E: school all seem plausible locations to store a notepad in close proximity to someone\u2019s person. Note that a notepad is defined as a physical device containing sheets of paper, so they are not digital devices. It's plausible that a notepad can be found in a variety of locations.\n\nD: Drug store is the best answer because the term \"notepad\", although broad in definition, is still specific enough to be defined. The Drug store is a store where one can purchase medication, and medications are small tablets or capsules with small labels. These labels are likely to have a short-term note for medication directions or other relevant instructions so that drugs can be used appropriately. \n\nA: The back pocket is a reasonable location to store a notepack because there have been notebooks placed in pockets before in modern history and it would be reasonable to assume that people would continue to keep writing implements and notebooks handy. However, back pockets are a very personal space. You wouldn't see a stranger reaching into someone's back pocket for personal items, which makes the answer plausible but not the best option.\n\nB: Meeting store, and this choice isn't too great. These are places where people go for personal items like clothing and toiletries. A meeting room wouldn't have the space to hold a notebook, nor would the security be great enough to leave a notebook in a public meeting room. However, it is plausible that a meeting room would have a store where one could purchase personal items, such as notebooks. It's just not as likely as options A-D. \n\nC: Same problem as the back pocket. You wouldn't typically see someone stepping out of a public meeting into a store and purchasing items for personal use and then leave those items within a public restroom.

Choices: 1) An unfair argument 2) Poison or food borne illnesses 3) A staged fistfight between friends 4) Unwanted sexual advances 5) Theft.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. An unfair argument would cause a fight between a couple or members of a team. It's not stated what type of 'friendly' fight, it could end badly but usually does not cause much damage.\n2. Poison or foodborne illness: this could cause bad arguments and disagreements but is not usually fatal.\n\n3. This answer choice refers to a staged fight between friends meant to boost morale or provide a healthy level or stress relief. While it could cause arguments and disagreements, the friends would likely resolve the situation quickly so it would not escalate and cause a 'brawl' - a large-scale physical fight between many people.\n\nAn argument or disagreement could turn into a brawl if at least one of participants in the discussion is intoxicated. If only one person is so then their judgment is impaired but they aren't really capable of fighting anyone effectively.\n\nThe most likely answer would be option 4: unwanted sexual advances.\n\nA person may feel 'attacked' by unwanted sexual", "answer": "B: basement"}

The sentence could also be interpreted as a statement expressing positive sentiment.  All of the choices are possible interpretations of the sentence.  A hyperbole could be the author's actual intent, but hyperbole is used to represent exaggeration, and the author may simply be making a statement of their own opinion.

{"text": "In order to determine the answer to the question, we first need to consider what the question asks us to do. It asks us to answer the question, however, the question doesn't provide enough information to narrow our choice to a specific item, it simply gives us an example instead of providing the complete list. \n\n#### Identifying what the option refers to:\n\nWe have to determine what item is being referred to once we've chosen an option. The options may refer to a specific item, type of item or both. Let's take the first item for example. \n\nThe first option is A, supermarket. \n\nConsidering that, supermarket is a type of item, we can further break it down into a specific item type. We know that a specific item type is chosen because it\u2019s a noun. As a result, it helps us identify more closely what the item being referred to in the question is. The question only gives the category of supermarket to choose from, but it doesn\u2019t make clear as to how to choose one specific item.\n\n#### Finding a solution:\n\nOnce we've found the appropriate item from the options, we must choose the one that best fits the example given. In the example, the item is: supermarket. There are a few items that can satisfy the request, but only one is specifically named for us. They are: cellar, water, soup and grocery store.\n\nIn order to avoid any confusion, we must use the name of the item listed in our choices by determining why we\u2019re choosing it. For example, the grocery store must be used because it\u2019s the item listed on the question as the correct choice.\nAfter determining the specific item we are going with, we must decide whether we need to substitute it or leave it as it is. We can use replacement if the item we are using has similar features as the original, but in a different context. In other cases, we may choose to leave it as is.\n\nFinally, the question gives an example in the statement, it\u2019s bland. It suggests that it is not the original way it should be, however, it doesn\u2019t specify how it should be different. We will answer the question based on the context clues. In this case, that is the addition of salt and pepper.\n\n### Answer: E: grocery", "answer": "D: soup"}

Airplane B is a fast mode of cargo transportation, but it's also very expensive since it's relatively uncommon for a passenger to move small items.\n2. Boat D is another mode of shipping and it's similar to airplane B, in that, it's fast and expensive. As in the case of B, D is not a fast method when dealing with small cargo and costs will be high as well.\n3. Ship's hold C is the storage area where cargo is carried by ship, but it's too slow for transportation of small cargo as opposed to larger cargo. It's not expensive and there won't be any issue regarding sending small cargo.\n4. Trains E are usually used for cargo transportation rather than small cargo and the storage area is usually separate from people. Hence, there is no issue to ship small cargo via the train.\n5. Truck E can be considered an fast alternative to ship's hold C since trucks move pretty fast, however the price will be high due to the expense of the gasoline required to fuel the engine.\n6.

{"text": "The question is asking about what motivates competitors to beat their foes, especially during sporting events. Since the context of the question is \"people\", we'll assume that this question is asking about competitors within sport, rather than a general motivator for all people. \n\nFor any competitor, the primary goal of competing is to win, if your main goal is to lose you shouldn't be competing in the first place.  \nThe term 'edge' is not common terminology in sport, instead it is more aligned with business.

{"text": "E: church\n\nRationales:\n1: Church could mean different things: the physical building, the congregation/organization, a service/mass, worship space, or other things. This implies that the answer choice is ambiguous but gives us a starting point to help eliminate inappropriate choices.\n2: If we look at the list of the other options above, we find that theaters are ruled out because they can refer to the building, the service/show, the seats, or multiple other things. None of those options are directly comparable to 'room' or 'lot of chairs'.\n\n### A common problem when facing ambiguous question choices is eliminating wrong choices. Rather than guessing or picking one option over another, we look for a way to eliminate most or all choices except for the one we want. Here, we're not trying to pick a single choice that is most suitable, but instead, we're looking at the answer choices to see if an elimination strategy can be implemented.\n\n### There are different strategies to use based on the number of options presented:\n\n#### One choice:\n\nEliminate the answer choices that have nothing to with the task or question. For example, if a question asks where to buy a pen, and the options are A: grocery store, B: electronics store, C: department store, and D: convenience store, then answer choice D: convenience store doesn't represent the correct location for buying a pen. Because it's an erroneous choice, that reduces the list to only three options: A: grocery, B: electronic, and C: department store.\n\n#### Multiple choices\n\nUse a strategy that weighs the strengths and weaknesses of the answer choices. We can also consider the contextual connections. For example:\n\nWhen we apply the above strategy to one or more of the answer choices, we can see that only two are strong choices that have solid connections to the question (A or B), while the other two are weakening options (C, D), therefore eliminating D. The final choice options include A and B\n\nWe also know, from the context of the previous question, that the church is a possible option for this question.

This will eliminate the \"via phone\" option as that refers to a particular mode of long-distance communication.\n2. The remaining four options might still be associated with sending gifts.

He just doesn't have a particular number system, not math skills. Option B doesn't mention luck, which makes it impossible. Option C is an absurd way to tell someone not to do something. He could just say that what he wants to tell you is that you are smart, you will succeed. Option D does mention luck, but he didn't say that success is dependent on luck, and it would be a strange way to tell someone to learn. It would be more likely that he believes that this is not a mathematical problem and the only things in life that help it are luck and intuition. Finally, option F does not mention that what he wants to convey is that they will succeed, which makes it absurd.

However, the question asks about a post-use clean-up scenario and does not mention a specific table set or the placement of items in that context.\n\n4: Option B (\"restaurant\") isn't the answer either, because the question asked about silverware once it's had time to dry and it's not ready to use. A restaurant scenario would imply that it is ready to use and wouldn't imply drying. \n\n5: Option C (\"cupboard\") is also incorrect as it simply means storage and not the area where silverware should be put.\n\n6: Option D (\"kitchen\") also is incorrect since it doesn't provide much detail regarding an appropriate storage setting. \n\n7: After reviewing the context, the relevant and specific information, the options and ruling out options that don't match those terms, we can conclude that the most specific and concise answer is E: \"sink\".\n\n8: Hence, answer choice is E: \"sinking\"\n\n\nInput: A woman is planning to visit to see her family, but needs to decide which airline to fly and cannot decide on which flight to choose?

{"text": "D: unique\n\n### Rationale:\n1.  The question's assumption is based on the fact that someone is more likely to have a special reaction to a gift that's rare or unique, compared to a gift that'll be common to other people.\n2.  The options are A: \"special\" and C: \"offended\"\n\n3.  Option A, \"special\", doesn't reflect how a recipient of a rare or unique gift will feel. \n\n4.  \"special\" is defined as \u201cdistinguished, exceptional, or noteworthy\u201d. These don't align with the context of \"rare\".\n5.  Option C, 'offended', could potentially be the recipient's response but it's a more aggressive reaction. Most people wouldn't be offended by a gift of this kind.\n\n6.  These leave us with the choices D: \"unique\" and E: \"rare\", which align most with the premise of the question.\n\n7.  Out of these two remaining options, option E, \"rare\", wouldn't seem to be appropriate. Most people will typically be able to relate to another person receiving a rare or unique gift. This would be less likely to make them feel \"special\" or \"offended\".\n\n8.

The question asked is about the likely outcome if someone eavesdrops when someone else is having a phone conversation. \n\n2. We can exclude option B, \"The conversation is made public\" from the premise. If this happens, it's unlikely that there was an eavesdropper involved.\n\n3.

{"text": "After analyzing the options, we see there are three options that can represent the feeling of satisfaction while eating everything on the menu: D: getting full, A: satisfaction, and E: getting sick. The choice A: satisfaction doesn\u2019t work because this option is already in the question and there aren\u2019t any other choices that say satisfaction except for options D and E. The choice D: getting full is correct because the question states that one tends to feel full after eating the whole menu, and the phrase \u201cgetting full\u201d can lead to one feeling full because the term itself means to fill something to the brim or full. The answer to the question is thus: D: getting full\n\n### Instructions\n\nThis type of question is related to the type of \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d type of instruction. The only difference is that the instruction is asking us to select one of the given choices and use it to fill in the blank. Therefore, we can solve this type of question in the same way that we solve the regular type.\n\n### Example:\nInput: Why are people more likely to be happy and confident when traveling to warm climates? Choices: 1. The environment is beautiful 2. People can wear less clothing. 3. It feels good to walk in the sun 4. It\u2019s difficult to be sad in the sun.\nThis is a common type of multiple choice question that can be solved through using the steps and instructions we\u2019ve already learned about. The answer, however, may be a bit tricky and requires a deeper step. To start, we\u2019ll look at the choices by eliminating options one and two because they make no sense in the context of this question.\n\nAfter that, we\u2019ll look carefully at the remaining answers and see if any more hints may help us. We\u2019ll rule out option number three because it contradicts the rest of the statement, which says people are happier and more confident in warm climates. Option four is the answer because it explains why the people might be happier and confident in this type of environment instead of feeling bad.\n\n### Key points\n- Identify the structure of the question and eliminate ambiguous answers. \n\n### Exercise:\n1. To solve this instruction:\n\n```\nWhen you go to a _____, you tend to meet lots of people. \n1. gym 2.", "answer": "B: getting full"}

An interesting observation was that many adolescents were not fully mature until they reached the age of ____. Choices:  A : 20's B : 21's C : 24's D : 25's E : 28's\nRationales:\n1. All options represent the chronological age that a person would reach to be considered an adult.\n2. Examining the choices given, 20's, 21's, 24's, and 25's are all in their early twenties where they would likely not be considered fully mature.\n3. The choice \"28's\" does not specifically reference being fully mature but reflects chronological age.\n4. Therefore, the options that accurately reflect the researcher's interest are \"21's\" and \"25's\",\n5. As the observation was likely to be that many adolescence would not be fully mature until they were twenty-one or twenty-five.\n6. Given these results, the final choice would be \"21's\".\n\nAnswer: B: 21's", "answer": "D: pet shops"}

However, jails are often used for short term sentences (less than a year) whereas prisons are long term facilities for individuals who are incarcerated for a long period of time.\n3. Option A: going to jains is a reference to jail, however, it doesn't make sense for a person who is a serial killer to be put in jail. Therefore, this is ruled out. 4. Option B: going to prison is more correct. Prison would be another place of incarceration suited for long term sentence.\n5. Option C \"Beat Jim up\" is incorrect for the reason that it could refer to anything from a physical assault to a verbal assault. If the police come across someone who they know is a serial killer, they are likely to arrest or detain them.\n6. Option D \"Get arrested\" is the correct option because it refers to the arrest of Jim and not any form of physical abuse. \n7.

{"text": "The right answer is \"A: launch pad\".\n\n### Rationales:1. Launch pad, the answer to the given question, is a surface or structure used to launch a rocket or other type of aerospace vehicle(s).\n2. We do not consider option \"C: aircraft carrier\" for the following reasons. First, an aircraft carrier is not found in the ocean as it is a ship, typically. Second, an aircraft carrier cannot be considered a mobile launching platform since its functions are limited to being a ship. Third, it is too large to be called a launching platform, which is often a smaller structure or surface.\n3. Similar to aircraft carrier, option \"D: large open area\" is not appropriate since it is not a mobile launching platform, either. Furthermore, it's not necessarily a launching area.\n4. Option \"E: space station's\" answer does not relate to the given context. It is a space station rather than a launching platform.\n5.

Choices: A: ducking B: covering your ears C: turning up the volume D: holding your breath E: hiding\nRationales:1: The question is asking us what to do if you hear a loud sound\n\n2: The options are choices that can be done to react to the sound\n\n3: Option A states to duck and do the dive into the pool. It does not specifically have anything related to a loud sound, it is stating to hide from the loud sound. So that is what we eliminate.\n\n4: Option B says if one were to duck they would want to cover their ears. This relates pretty well to what we are asked to do. But once again this option does not have the part to be loud.\n\n5: Option C says to turn up the volume. What else does this option say?\n6: Option C says to do nothing, just turn up the volume when there is a loud sound. This also can be a very bad idea. Turning up the volume may help reduce the noise, but it will not protect from the sound of the loudness if you already know to duck and cover your ears.\n\n7: Option D says to hold your breath. What happens while you do this? You will pass out and have bad effects of the loud sound, it is also very irresponsible to use.\n\n8: Option E is a very general answer. It does say to \u201chide\u201d. However this option says to hide everywhere.

Sky diving is a sport that involves jumping from high altitudes and reaching higher speeds before landing. \n3. In this scenario, jumping from a plane in the sky could result in death or injury to an individual. However, falling down is not possible.\n4. Death is the most immediate consequence of such a jump if everything goes wrong. It represents the end of an individual's life.\n5. Coma, which doesn't represent the end of one's life, refers to a state of unconsciousness while playing Uno might simply entail sleeping.\n6.

So, in reality if you construct a massive or huge building if you have done it poorly, the consequence would be that the building would not be \u201cmassive\u201d and \u201chuge\u201d anymore. Thus, this would mean that the building would be reduced, or \u201cdecreased\u201d, in mass due to the poor construction. \n\n### Further Support: In the sentence \u201cIf a bridge collapses, it is bad news for those living nearby\u201d, \u201cbridges collapse\u201d.

The value that it represents in this case is democracy. \nThe statue has to be strong and tall enough to represent the values that America stands for. \nSo the foundation of the statue has to be strong to uphold the values that represents the symbolism.

Choices: \t A: first alphabetical B: second alphabetical C: surname D: street name E: first name\n\n### Response\nUnder the alphabetical listing, the first letter in the name gives a person's first initial; when a name appears as an entry of less than four letters followed immediately by a space, the first letter is the initial of the surname. This is why the first alphabetical listing in a phone directory is not the 'first name' but the 'last name.' The rule should be applied to 'Alice', who would appear under 'Alice L' or 'A L'.\n\n### Instructions: What would most likely occur if a person was trying to read a paragraph and it became a blurry black mass to him? Answer: The person might have gone near-sighted.\n\n### Why?\nThe paragraph is most likely to become a blurry black-mass to the reader when that reader looks at it while their eyes are near-sighted, i.e., after the reading power (dioptre) of the human eye has declined beyond a certain point. In other words, near-sightedness is defined by reduced reading power of the eyes. This would have also been the case if the reader was having far-sightedness (hyperopia) - it is in this case that the paragraph would need to be read in a magnifying glass. If the reader was instead suffering from squinting eyes, then the paragraph would become a blurry white mass.\n\n### Question: He went to his friend's place to watch a movie. While watching, he was so fascinated that the end of the movie was a blurry image to him. What would most likely be the cause of this? Answer:\tHe may have had had difficulty seeing clearly due to presbyopia, which is an eyesight disorder caused by loss in the ability of the eye lenses to focus well on close objects resulting from aging", "answer": "D: park"}

Choices: A: An adult fly B: A worm C: A beetle D: An egg-laying insect E: None of these answers Choices: An egg-layng insect F: A bee G: None of these answers\n\nRationales:\n\n### In context, we can reasonably infer that since the topic of the passage is insect metamorphosis, it must be referring to the process during which an insect's life cycle progresses from one generation to another.\n\n### Choices A: adult fly or B: worm don't directly support the process of generating new life for metamorphosis. Adult insects are already adults, and worms have no need of metamorphosis since they are completely stationary in their lives.\n\n### Additionally, the choice C: beetle doesn't fit well since beetles are a type of insect and should have been classified as such, along with other choices such as B: worm.\n\n### As the context relates to insects and their metamorphosis, option E: None of these choices doesn't apply well and is discarded. Further, the definition of insects includes more than just flies and bees. More specifically, the definition includes worms, beetles, and even larvae since they all belong to the class insects.\n\n### From what we learn above, option G: None of these does not represent a reasonable choice.\n\n### With our analysis complete, we are left with option F: A bee.

Neither of these two options seem to match what the author actually writes, making it evident that the author doesn\u2019t intend for the text to be bright or clear.

Choices: 1: a loss of income2: a loss of respect3: a failure to appear at promotional events4: public ridicule5: none of the above\n\n### Response\nOption 5: None of the above is the best solution. I chose it due to being a good explanation for why other options are all possible.\n\n### Explanation:\nAll other options are plausible and have something to do with why \"None of These\" is the best answer.\n\n1.\tLoss of income is a possible outcome, as it's not a requirement to be in the blockbuster, but it's unlikely that a star actor would be ignored by studios if they're not in a big movie - they'd simply appear in another movie, or do a TV show or go on tour.\n\n2.\tThis option is correct. It fits the situation - and there may not be the level of respect needed for the blockbuster. It's also an incomparable situation in terms of the other options, so the likelihood is very likely.\n\n3.\tA lack of appearances is not necessarily a bad thing, but it's an unusual one for a big movie star so it's not likely. Also, the actor would still be expected to do promotional events and appearances.\n\n4.\t\"Public ridicule\" is a bit subjective, but in general is an option that shouldn't necessarily be discounted. There are cases where an individual is ignored publicly and it's likely one reason is to not have to deal with the star. It's possible but not likely.\n\n### Solution:\nNone of the above is the most plausible response for the scenario.\nIt fits by not discounting any option and instead providing an alternative explanation.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple choice question\nRationales: A: Frustration\n\n### Response Demonstration: \nInput: Bob and Boris are in line at the grocery  store.  The line is fast, but the children  in front of them are loud. They are experiencing what? Choices:  A : frustration B : being annoyed  C : delays  D : irritation  E : out of  order\nRationales:\n1. The question refers to queues at the grocery shopping  store.\n2. The children  in front of Bob  and Boris are making noise and thus inconveniencing their line.  Since the store is fast, they are suffering from this delay.  They are unable to shop as quickly as they would have wanted.\n3. Frustration, Choice A, is defined as a strong  feeling of annoyance, displeasure, or anger, so it's a natural reaction to a delay like that.  It's not  a feeling that's unique to inconveniences in queues.  Thus, it  can't be our answer.\n4. Being annoyed, Choice B, is to not suffer but to show  irritation in response to an inconvenience.  We know from earlier answer choices that, although annoyed, the children are more likely to cause an inconvenience for Bob and Boris.  Thus Choice B isn't the answer to this question either.\n5. Delays, Choice C, refer to a slowdown in usual flow of a situation.  Since the grocery store is generally fast, and the customers are being inconvenienced due to delays, then Choice C is ruled out.\n6. Irritation, Choice D, is again a very similar  emotion to annoyance in that it refers to a feeling of indignation or  annoyance brought about by some action or incident.  Given that children are more likely to be a source of action while in the queue this is ruled out.\n7. The remaining answer, out of order, would describe this situation as incorrect, so we cannot select this one.\n8. Therefore, there really is no suitable option to describe the effect this situation has on Bob and Boris.\n\nAnswer: No answer\n\nInput: The answer to this", "answer": "B: being annoyed"}

The other options in the list have nothing to do with the reason, they are just a waste of time.\n2. From the choices, there are two kinds of valid choices based on your previous thoughts and understanding of the phone and time.\n3. Choices: B,C have nothing to do with it; they are not relevant choices.\n4. Among the relevants, choice E: keep pace with the others should be eliminated as they indicate that you are comparing yourself with others with a phone, but this time you just need a phone only.\n5. Choice Choice D: check on your email may be useful too, if you have checked your email recently, then we can keep choice d or e.\n6.

{"text": "A: attack E: jump  \n### Explanation: Answer: A, attack, is the most likely response, based on the following reasoning. The question asks for how a flea moves. The answer is a verb (locomote). Since the question says \"how a flea locomotes,\" the answer to the question should be a verb (action word). Verbs can be categorized based on the form the body of the verb takes. The word \"locomote\" is a verb in the Gerundive form. This means that the verb is in the present participle tense. The question is asking for a verb in this form, and attack is an action that occurs in the present participle form. Another alternative is to choose a verb in another form. For example, if the question is, \"How does a dog grow up?\" the best answer would be \"to grow up,\" because that is the past participle form of the verb \"grow\".", "answer": "E: jump"}

Choices: 1: A: their tests 2: A: the surgery 3: B: results 4: B: the hospital 5: C: the surgical staff 6: C: the surgery\n\n### Answer The answer is option C: the surgery.  This option is consistent with the context of the question and the premise, which is that the doctor has finished her job. Surgery generally follows a series of tests and treatments/observations beforehand.  Therefore, option C: the surgical surgery is the correct answer here.\n\n### Input II: The dog has a lot of hair. A:  How does he clean himself? B:  How is it cleaned? C:  How may we clean it? D:  Why is he clean? E:  He will do it once.\n\n### Answer: The option D: 'Why is he clean' is correct as he's a dog and dogs naturally clean themselves.

{"text": "Bookstore.\n\n### Detailed Rationales:\n1. There are several clues in the question stem that indicate a store is likely to be the answer here. There are many stores that sell books but there are no stores that sell other things like cities. \n2. The question stem then uses the word \"find\" which implies an effort is needed. Magazines and phonebooks aren't places to \"find\" a bookstore, so they can be ruled out. \n3. The word \"store\" is used several times in the question (in \"store\" and \"bookstore\") which indicates \"store\" is likely to be the correct answer. \n4. It is also worth noting that a bookstore is a place and not a service or an object. This further points to bookstore being the correct answer based on what the question stem is asking. \n\n### Additional tips for completing the rest of this test\n\nThere will be several questions in the future that take less time to complete since it's likely to be a small set or an easy question. You can attempt to go through every question because there will still be many questions in the beginning that are either too technical or don't match the required answer format.", "answer": "C: city"}

Choices:  B: outdoor park C: movie theater D: mall E: grocery store\n\n### Response\n> The reason why the mall and grocery store were the best answers (and even just one answer) was that in the given instructions, we are asked to avoid conversation but it is not specified if we just don\u2019t want a conversation or a real conversation.\n> At the same time, it is also specified that we need to avoid a \u201creal\u201d conversation and so \u201cdeliberately\u201d talking to someone in the mall or at the grocery store could count as a \u201creal\u201d conversation.\n### Input: Why may we assume the presence of a shark?

The choice of A: 30 is not correct because 30/30 = 1.0\n3. The choice of B: 15 is not correct, 15/30=0,5 as we would be able to tell if 7 out of 11=63,48% would work 4.

What do you think we can infer about this person's mode of transportation? Choices:  a: bicycle b: horse c: car d: bus e: van\nRationales: Let's take a look at the hints from the article: 1.  She had to walk to get to where she was getting mail. 2. She was traveling back from a shopping trip. 3. There were many shops in the area where mail tending would be a lot of work. 4. The lady was wearing a cape made of a red material. 5. Many of her clothes were lightweight. 6. The lady had a large shopping bag and a large envelope that held a \"pound of letters.\"\n\nIf you consider all of these clues and the question, you may deduce the following: 1. The lady has a vehicle, though not necessarily in the form of a car or bus. 2. She is likely to be wearing a coat; either it's very cold, or she's walking in the snow.\n\nReflecting on the answers, you are likely to rule out answers that don't fit the bill. \n\n1. The lady walking on the snowy road can't be riding a bicycle without an adequate layer of clothing.\n2. It's unlikely to be the case that you have a mode of transport that uses a horse to pull it as the weather has to be favorable to do so, and that probably isn't the case for the scenario being discussed.\n3. A horse is large, so would likely not be able to fit in the van which only has a passenger capacity of 1.\n4. The horse would not be able to pull the van up an inclined road, and the cape and clothes would likely be ruined in the process.\n5.

A: In an apple; B: On the left side C: In the abdomen D: In your head\n\n### Output: An apple does not have a heart and thus is incorrect.

The other options, B: intimacy, D: happiness, and E: enjoyment, are not sufficient when describing the situation.\n\n### For the purpose of answering this question, intimacy is understood to be an indication of privacy and affection.

If there is no word or phrase that appropriately completes this sentence, choose your answer choice by process of elimination. Input: The driver of this vehicle appears to be suffering from some mental or _________ disorder of some kind. Choices:  A. physical B. emotional C. psychological D. medical \nRationales:\n1. The question refers to driver's behavior i.e his driving skills and his response to questions asked by officers.\n2. A mental disorder generally refers to a condition that impacts an individual's thoughts and feelings, more so than his ability to drive as evidenced by the questions asked to determine the drivers' driving skills.\n3. A physical disorder would be a diagnosis made based on observable symptoms that negatively impact one's ability to drive.\n4. An emotional condition refers to a diagnosis related to an individual's emotional state.\n5. A psychological diagnosis is more focused on an individual's thoughts, memories, and behaviors than physical aspects.\n6. A medical disorder is typically a physical condition like a brain injury that affects cognitive functions which would then directly lead to difficulties with driving and not necessarily simply the result of being inebriation, or \"drunk\"\n7. Therefore, option D, \"medical disorder\", represents the most logical answer choice, as it is the one that most directly aligns with psychological disorders that may impact an individual's driving.\n\nInput: Your medical examiner is looking at your report, what can he see and does he use it to help diagnose your patient?

The other options mentioned refer to a different location, but not necessarily one where a ferret may get lots of attention.\n\n### Input The following questions are based on the reading passage.\n\n#### Questions 1 through 7 refer to the article below\nA recent article by an author that was once famous has been returned from a publisher and will not be published. Its author, a popular celebrity, is known for writing fiction. This manuscript\u2019s publisher claimed that it was unsuitable and that its author needed more time to improve it. In response, the author insisted that it was great and that the publisher needed a new editor instead. If the book should be printed in the future and the editor had a long tenure at this publishing house, what would this editor be most well-known for? Choices: \nA: A well-known author\nB: An author who is often critiqued\nC: a famous author who has written many best sellers\nD: A fiction author who has written over 100 novels\nE: A famous critic who has over 100 years of criticism experience\nRationales: Question (1) An editor may be known for his or her talent, skill, or expertise depending on their background. Because this editor is from a publishing house that published that author\u2019s previous work as well as the current manuscript, this editor could potentially be a famous editor. However, the author\u2019s claim that the new book is great suggests against the author\u2019s manuscript, and a publisher should be aware of the manuscript\u2019s potential.\nIf the publishing house has many bestseller authors, then the new book may be from an author known for writing famous fiction. However, a critic is more likely to critique work. While the author and this editor may have a conflict, they could potentially both be experts in their fields.\n\n#### Question 8 through 14 are based on the video below\nWhich pair of words below should NOT be added to a sentence?

{"text": "### Demostration:\n\n#### Rationale\n1. The instruction asks whether the room's entry point was kept 'open' or 'closed'.\n2. \"Opened\" and \"closed\" are the only two that are explicitly related to the room entry point.\n3. \"Falling down\" isn't appropriate since this doesn't specifically refer to any action.\n4. \"Locked\" doesn't refer to something specifically being 'locked'; \"locking something\" would suggest an action is taken toward an object, which is different from leaving a point open or closed.\n5. The same applies to \"found at shower\" where the room-entry point isn't 'found' specifically at a shower.\n6. The options that are left in context could relate to the opening or closing of the door to the room:\n7. Option A: The door is 'opened/opened' meaning leaving the door unlocked and opening it to some degree.\n\n8. Option B: leaving the room entry point 'Closed.'\n\n9.

Temperature is typically measured using a thermometer, which is considered to be a scientific instrument for measuring temperature, thus it's not required to be listed among choices.  \n2. A, steam hot, is not scientific; B, freezing water, is confusing and not specific; C, cold, is not scientific; D, melting ice, is scientific; E, boiling water, would not be considered a scientific measurement system; F, cold degrees Celsius, isn't scientific.  \n3.

Choice B (\"Healthy\") does relate to the disease, however, it doesn't express desperation to treat the disease. \n4. The remaining choices A (\"Cause spots on leaf\"), B (\"Cure\") and C(\"Ball stopped\") all indicate potential symptoms or effects of a particular disease and hence relate with desperation to get a cure.

Choices:  A: Run B: Destroy C: Examine D: Search E: Purchase\nRationales: As the result of rocket launch, something could crash onto Earth's surface. This situation requires appropriate measures. \n\n* Running away from a missile is an option that would potentially save an individual's life, and therefore, would be considered as the safest and most logical solution. However, this is a hypothetical situation which may not always be the case, so in this case, it's more appropriate to consider the safest solution.\n* Another option is destroying the item; however, it seems unsafe because this would involve destruction of something with unknown attributes as well as the destruction of personal property.\n* As for option C: Examine, while this may be a possible step when finding out the nature of the item, it isn't the most suitable option here because such an item would probably be classified as a missile, and therefore, should be destroyed.\n* In regards to option D: Search, while this may help find information about an inbound missile, searching may not necessarily help one avoid the item. There can be a delay in completing the task and the delay may lead to further damage from the missile.\n* Option E: Purchase, while it may be the most reasonable option in some situations (example: if the missile is intended to be purchased/sold for monetary gain), in this context a missile is most likely to be classified as an inbound weapon and therefore should not be purchased.\n\nThe answer should reflect a logical and safe solution. As suggested in the description, the only logical solution here is to run. This is, in fact, the safest solution as an individual who runs away from the item may survive and avoid further damages from the item as well. \n\nAnswer: Run\n\n### Input-Output Ex", "answer": "D: wall"}

Choices: \nA: Strategy formulation B: Strategy implementation C: Strategy Evaluation D: Strategy formulation and evaluation E: Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats\nRationale:\nStrategy formulation and evaluation are both important areas of focus when creating any strategic plan. \nStrategy formulation involves identifying the organization's strategic goals for the future, while strategy evaluation involves assessing the effectiveness of the strategies employed to achieve the organization's goals. \nBoth components are necessary for creating a successful strategic plan.\nStrategy implementation involves executing the strategies developed in the strategic planning process. Without implementing the strategies, the plan is not effective and will not achieve the desired results.\n\n### Responses:\n\nI agree that strategy formulation and evaluation are key areas of focus. From my experience, I usually start with a SWOT analysis and then use that understanding to identify potential opportunities and threats to my organization's strategic planning objectives. In addition, I would also recommend including a section on strategy implementation in the plan as well, as this will help keep the plan on track and ensure that the organization is able to achieve its goals.\n\n### Input 3: What is the main purpose of strategic planning? Choices: A: To create a strategy to achieve objectives B: To create a strategy for a specific objective C: To understand what is happening D: To look at a wide range of factors\n\nThe main purpose of strategic thinking is to determine the goals of an organization, and ways to achieve them in a coherent way which should include the following:", "answer": "A: jerusalem"}

We use a numbering system of 10 to represent number values to make it easier to process when reading/writing.\n\nResponse:A number system is basically a way of using symbols to represent values. By using 10 as our numeral in the numbering system we greatly minimize the numbering system required to be memorized. This allows more time and brain power to be allocated to the number itself.\n\nThe numbering system is not exclusive to writing as it can also be used in speech and even mathematics by humans.\n\nBase 17, or radix 17 is another numbering system and is often called the decimal system.

You can submit your response if you are not an administrator. \n\n### Demo\n\nInput: Where can you get a strawberry pie?  Choices: A: supermarket B: pie factory C: pie shop D: grocery store E: farmer's market\n\nDemonstration:\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe question is asking us to answer the prompt using a specific location and location-specific options.\n\nLooking at the context, we have strawberry and pie. Pie is associated with an ingredient and something that is made at home, whereas strawberry is typically associated with an outdoor fruit typically found in farms rather than shops. Thus, we would reasonably expect the pie to come from a grocery store. The options in context then suggest the answer is D: grocery shop.\n\n### Rationale\n\nOption A: Supermarket is likely where any pie would be purchased. However, strawberry is not a normal pie ingredient so grocery is rejected.\nOption B: Pie factory is discarded since a pie factory would not sell a pie, only make it.\nOption C: Pie shop is rejected since the question was about where to find a strawberry pie. Although pie shops are an option, they are not the best answer for this question.\nOptions D: Grocery store and E: Farmer's market are appropriate responses since they are where one would expect to shop for pies.\nGrocery store is rejected for the following reason. The question gives the context for a strawberry pie and the answer must be grocery store. We may expect to walk into a grocery store and find a strawberry slice but we wouldn't expect to find a whole strawberry pie in the produce section.\nHence, the answer to the sentence is D: groc", "answer": "B: animal shelter"}

Choices:  Vodka A, Rum E2,  Beer C, Wine D, Water B \nRationales: Vodka is typically clear and does not contain much alcohol, which means it is not likely to need refrigeration. It can even be stored at room temperature. \nOption B, Water, is not likely to need to be refrigerated unless there is significant risk of temperature-related contamination. Temperature control can increase cost and energy use, two factors that are ineffective in addressing bacterial growth or water purity. \nOption C, Beer, like wine, is designed to be served at relatively cool temperatures. It should not be affected by refrigeration because of its carbonation. \nOption D, wine, also does not require refrigeration. Red wine requires a very different environment than red wine. These are the reasons it should not require refrigerator as well. \nOption E, Rum, is likely to need refridge if the storage temperature rises above 96 degrees Fahrenheit. Higher temperatures can cause a rum to become cloudy after being exposed for an extended period of time. This is because heat increases the production of bacteria and flavor compounds, resulting in a muddier-looking drink.\nAnswer: A: Vodka\n\n### Input\n```\n\nYou've got a 100 dollar bill.

Choices: A: greater than $10 C: greater than $5 B: greater than $1,000 D: greater than $1 E: greater than $500\n\nRationales: We are asked to determine the word \u201ca lot\u201d in the sentence. \u201cTo have a lot\u201d can mean multiple things. A literal lot can mean to have a lot of money in the bank. We can say someone \u201chas lots of money\u201d by implying in the bank, not in hand. However, if someone is asking you to help them with a lot of money, what does \u201ca lot of money\u201d means?  There is no way to know unless we find the context of the sentence.  We can get clues based on how they would be asking for your help for a lot of money in a hypothetical scenario. But let\u2019s answer the actual question.  The options could provide some meaning of \u201ca lot of money \u201cthat could apply to the context.  Option E: \u201cnone of the above\u201d is the first option to get thrown out. It\u2019s not going to be the answer and we can rule it out for now.  In a situation where someone says they need help with paying for groceries, they would probably not be asking for $500 to pay for their groceries. That\u2019s quite too low for someone who needs that money to buy more things.  So rule out that this is not an option anymore.  Option A: This one also gets thrown out because it\u2019s too high to get approved.  C: This one is close but if it were $500 then that would be enough money to pay for groceries. However Earl is only offering $5, so Earl wouldn\u2019t be asking for $1k for someone to buy groceries.  Rule out this option too.  B & D:", "answer": "B: generous"}

In this case \u2018credit\u2019 would be the most ideal because it would be the easiest to pay. \u2018Coins\u2019 seems like an outlier choice since it requires you to carry extra amounts of money or find places to exchange them for cash. \u2018Dollar\u2019 while being an acceptable payment method doesn\u2019t seem like an ideal choice for you because it would require you to carry extra dollars, and having dollars at all times is probably not common for you. \u2018Cash\u2019 while being the least ideal seems like it might be practical in certain situations but not for this particular transaction where carrying around extra money may not be feasible. \u2018Check\u2019 is probably something that you would be using at checkout if you were shopping for the first time and you would feel comfortable handing over your personal financial details at that time. In this case checking may be the most ideal method of payment for you.\nAnswer: A: check", "answer": "E: reproduce"}

Choices:  A. two and half  B. 3.05 C. 2.56 D. 2.85 E. 3.75\nRationales: The question is asking us what is the purpose of the meeting. The purpose is to decide either to go forward a 2.6 or if so, go with a 3.5. If we accept C, 2.56, we are saying the purpose of the meeting is to decide 2.6 or the purpose is to decide on a 2.56. This would be not a correct answer because we are to decide a decision about 2.56 and the only decision that can be made is 2.6, not 2.56 so we cannot choose this. If we were to accept choice B, 3.05, we are saying the answer is to decide 3.05 and not 2.6. This too would be incorrect because they cannot decide on 3.05. So if we accept A. two and half or B. 3.20 we are going with a decision of choice A or B.

The options A: send a package and E: mail something are redundant.\n3. Option C: send a letter is not appropriate. Mailing letters is just the service a mail carrier will carry out on orders. He does not determine that it's supposedly an important one.\n4. Option B: mail a letter doesn't fit our context and would not be a mail system carrier's purpose as he doesn't decide which letters will go to mailboxes. This can be done by a post office.\n5. Therefore, from eliminating redundant options and eliminating those not fitting our context, the only option left is D: send something. Since we do not know what that \"something\" is, the correct answer could be either A or D but option D is the more likely outcome.\nAnswer: D", "answer": "A: jewelry store"}

Which of the following statements best summarizes the scientist's purpose? Choices: A: Explore the human body in order to understand the world. B: Observe the human body in order for him to experience its beauty. C: Examine the human body in order that he could study it. D: Investigate the human body in order he could master it. E; Study the human body in order gain some knowledge.\n\nRationales:\n1: It seems that the scientist had learned about the human body and is now more curious. So, his goal has become exploration of other aspects of the human body. He is now looking at the human body in a different way. He still wants to continue exploring it.\n2: The answer could also be B. But since the scientific approach doesn't need to be an \"art\" it doesn't seem right to combine the two.\n\n3: Option C states a goal of study, which isn't very helpful since we've already stated that the scientist has already achieved his goal (explore the human body).\n\n4: D seems closer to the goal but I think we can make the conclusion that, in order to explore the human body, he has to be in better health himself, so he might not need to investigate it in detail.\n\n5: Option E: Study the human body in an order to gain some knowledge. This is a close answer but since he has been through that part by examining the human body in more depth, he can understand the parts more. In this sense, exploration is similar to study but study alone would still be a goal.\n\n6: So the correct answer has been reached via deductive reasoning method.\n\nAnswer: C: Examine (study) the human body in order.\n\n### Input A scientist has just discovered that water moves at a different temperature than the temperature at which it becomes a solid when frozen and a liquid when it melts.

{"text": "### Detailed response: This question is fairly easy from a grammar standpoint, but can be tricky to answer. When you look at the choices from A down, the question specifically states \"shopping.\" If you had to guess, you'd think that shopping is in a grocery store of some kind.\n\n### This can be the assumption for many, but the word shopping is used fairly generally. You could be shopping at an outdoor farmer's market, in an indoor grocery store, or in a mall. Because of this, any of the answers are good possibilities.\n\n### When looking at A, Chicago is the second largest city in the United States, and is a good place to find a restaurant if you're in Chicago, but is unlikely to be found where shopping is taking place.\n\n### To add a bit more speculation here, you can probably guess that there may be some Italian influences in the restaurant. But that doesn't mean that the restaurant is strictly Italian.\n\n### Likewise, B, Street, could simply refer to the place where your shopping is taking place, like a mall, or it could refer to a place where shops are found.\n\n### Again, if you're guessing, you could choose either of these.\n\n### If we look at C, Little Italy, we know that Italy is a European country heavily known for it's good food, so if there was a place called little Italy, then it might have good food. But again, this may imply that a place called Little Italy wouldn't just be in an Italian style restaurant, but could apply to lots of different types of food.\n\n### It's hard to tell if the shopping in question is referring to food, which is what D may imply, but if you're shopping for different food than just pizzas, then this is clearly an incorrect answer.\n\n### But if you're shopped for pizza, then E, Capital Cities, is incorrect. The word Capital could mean a major city by some definitions, but if a place is a city, then you wouldn't necessarily expect pizza.\n\n### The most reasonable options here, in our opinion though, are either B, Street, if the shopping is in a place that has lots of shops in one location", "answer": "D: food court"}
{"text": "This is an analogy question:\n\nThe question asks what type of network would connect two computers wirelessly. We can eliminate all of the answers that are physical items, since one of the computers being connected to a freeway or road wouldn't even be possible. The next possibility would be connecting the two machines with electric wires, but this isn't a viable solution. The same thing goes for connecting two computers to a radio network. That leads us to looking at the last few options. Both of these options could be thought of as a network of computers connecting to one another. D: computer network represents two computers that share information with one another and can be the correct answer. Answer: D: computer network\n\n### Input I need to buy food for tonight. What type of store should I visit? Choices:  I: vegetable B: grocery C: hardware D: restaurant E: gas\n\n### Response\nThe question asks for the correct type of store to visit. All of the options exclude vegetable and hardware stores. This leaves I: grocery and D: restaurant. Grocery stores can sell things from vegetables to fruits to fish and more. Therefore the correct answer is I: grocery. Answer: I: grocery\n\n### Input A lawyer is a person who specializes in what? Choices: I: legal B: law enforcement C: law D: politics E: government\n\n### Response To get the correct answer you must understand what each of the terms mean, so let's go over them. Politics and government are terms used to describe who runs a community, like a city, county, state or country. This means that the answer is not governance and therefore politics or government. The next part of the question is related to law enforcement. Law enforcement represents people and their organizations. Government can encompass law enforcement, but it can also apply to politics and law. Therefore you should consider all of three of these choices to figure out the answer. Lawyers specialize in legal cases and lawyers represent their clients. Therefore the answer is not lawyer, law enforcement or government. The last choice left is legal. A lawyer represents his/her clients on legal issues. Therefore the correct answer to the question is I: legal. Answer: I: legal\n\n### Input There used to be a lot of dinosaurs.

{"text": "Demonstration:\n\n\nInput: How should a person respond if they are given a gift? Choices: \n\tA: say thank you B: show gratitude C: be grateful D: be gracious E: give a gift\n\nRationales:\n\n7. The person should acknowledge the gift with expressions of thanks and gratitude. Option A says the person must show gratitude. This implies active, tangible action and expression rather than simply verbal acceptance. Therefore, the only option that suits the request is C: be grateful.\n8. The person shouldn't be gracious. This adjective doesn't directly demonstrate appreciation.\n9. They shouldn't give a gift in return because that's more of an indirect way to respond to a gift by someone else.\n10. Similarly, they shouldn't answer by saying 'thank you' because that's too minimal. If someone gives you a gift, being polite isn't enough to show that you're truly grateful for their thoughtful act.\n11. There shouldn't be anything negative about responding to a gift. Option D makes it sound like having gratitude is contingent upon having other qualities that, when combined, can have a negative impression. So, the remaining option should be the more appropriate response.\n12. The answer in the question is C.\nA: be grateful\n\nInput: What can someone expect to feel after reading a book they were really excited about? Choices: \tA: remorse B: relief C: disappointment D: hope E: satisfaction\n\nRationales\n7. After reading a book someone loves, they'll almost certainly feel satisfied. Option E (\"satisfaction\") indicates the outcome of a process that started with high expectations to which the reader has since compared their own experience. When the reader's expectation is either satisfied or exceeded, they'll feel satisfied. When the expectation is not met or surpassed, they'll be disappointed. Reading a book with higher than expected hopes could possibly lead to the feeling of hope. But, feeling satisfied implies success in accomplishing the goal - getting satisfaction from reading a book. So, it makes more sense that a reader will be disappointed if they cannot feel satisfied with the book they read. That's why the choices C-E are excluded from the", "answer": "C: speak information"}

Choices: \nA: a small dog bowl B: a medium dog bowl C: a large dog bowl D: a medium dog pouch E: many bowls together\nRationales:\n1. To answer the question, first you should understand what question you're asking.\n2. Here the question is \"What does a dog usually need _____ to eat?\" \n3. Therefore, we should look for the word usually. \n4. In English we normally understand that to be hungry you have to eat. \n5. To understand how the speaker is using the word eat, let's look at its definitions.\n6. The first definition we find is \"(of people) hungry\", which relates to being hungry. \n7. In fact, if we look closely we see a related definition, \"(of plants) hungry\" which is also appropriate. \n8. This definition describes someone or something needs to be fed.\n9. So to answer the question, we pick the most logical choices of what the speaker is saying: A, B, C, D, E: bowl, pouch, and bowls.\n10.

{"text": "B: dangerous\n\nRationales:\n\n1. A. Stressful driving (Option A) refers to a situation in which a driver faces challenges or fears while driving. It doesn't necessarily lead to accidents.\n2. B. Dangerous driving (Option B) is the type of driving that leads to accidents. It involves unsafe behavior such as speeding, drunk driving, or cell phone use while driving.\n3. C. Fun driving (Option C) refers to driving for pleasure or joy, such as going out for a drive or having a road trip. This type of driving is not likely to lead to accidents, as it is not characterized by unsafe behavior.\n4. D. Illegal driving (Option D) refers to driving in violation of the law, such as driving without a license or insurance or driving under the influence of drugs. This type of driving may lead to accidents, but it is not necessarily the cause of the accident.\n5. E. Deadly driving (Option E) refers to a type of dangerous driving that is so reckless or negligent as to result in death or serious injury, such as speeding, aggressive driving, or carelessness. This type of driving leads to more accidents than other types, but it is not the only scenario that leads to accidents, and it does not mean a person will always cause an accident if they drive in a way that is considered deadly.\n6. Therefore, Option B: dangerous driving is the most accurate answer to the question. \n7. Option A: Stressful driving does not automatically lead to accidents, and option C: Fun driving does not always cause accidents.\n8. Option E: Deadly driving is the most dangerous, but it does not always cause an accident, and it may occur in combination with other types of driving that lead to accidents. \n9. Option D: Illegal driving can lead to accidents, however, it does not always cause accedents.\n10. Option B: Dangerous driving is the most likely scenario to lead to accidents. It reflects the most unsafe behavior and involves a high degree of risk.\nAnswer: B: dangerous driving.\n\nInput: In order to create a playlist, you have to complete all of the following actions: 1: create a user 2: play an album 3:", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

B: Most markets and shops are not open 24/ so the man will not go to the market. C: Libraries are not open 22/7 and will also not be preferred due to lack of facilities, and no facilities for bathing or drinking. D: Banks are not open for 24/7 so not the right answer for the person.

{"text": "A: owner\nRationale: The options are narrowed down to base, foot and subordinate. Although foot and base are reasonable choices, foot, as a singular entity is unlikely because bases and feet are collective nouns, foot and base are more likely a group or team. While subordinate in the dictionary meaning is a noun or even an adjective, the question does not specify if it may be used as either in this context which would make the answer D: subordinate. However, in context, since the person asking is a woman, she is likely a subordinate to an authority of the branch, the head of the branch, and the given option A: owner. There is a good degree of likelihood that an owner would be a person and authority of a branch, hence, A: owner is the best answer.\n\n### Input.

The refrigerator is one location out of the pantry and a kitchen cupboard is the other. As a general rule, the pantry would be the best option as it keeps moisture at bay while maintaining a steady temperature environment making ideal preservation conditions. The refrigerator may seem like a good choice given it keeps food at a lower temperature, however, fluctuations in temperature can cause spoilage.

To solve this question, we first need to identify the key part in Freddy. In this case, Freddy means Fred, and the key bit of this meaning is the last bit: 'dy'. 'Dy' as a word meaning a person who is called Fred, is used a lot.\n2. 'Freddy' could also mean to a group of people who are called 'Fred'. Then, 'Freddy, Fred Freddy, please read the book' might mean 'Group of Freddy, please read this/that'.\n3.

The meaning 'Freddy, we have guests comming' is also possible but doesn't make sense in", "answer": "C: have tools"}
{"text": "### Explanation:\nThe question requires us to identify the best location to throw a rock into a river. Our goal is to make a big splosh when throwing a rock. In order to make a big splough you want to throw a rock directly in the river. That would mean the river should be the landing spot - either the water itself or the surface of the earth in between. There must not be a mountain nearby that might cause you to have a splinth injury by throwing the rock at it.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question asks us to determine a specific location to land the rock. We seek a location for the rock to land into the river.\n2. If we throw the rock into the mountain, then our splong is going to be interrupted if the rock lands on the mountain itself and not into the water. \n3. We can thus discard B: ground because throwing a rock at ground is going to cause an interruption and won't result in a big sploth that we want to achieve. \n4. Option C: bridge is not as intuitive as land on the surface of earth because a bridge would be a landmark that is already in place. You'll be throwing a rock towards the already present bridge. This would be less impactful if that's what your goal is. It's not throwing something into something else. It's throwing something towards something, already in place.\n5. Option D: \"mountain range\"  isn't a helpful response if the goal is to throw the rock into the water. Throwing a rock towards another mountain in a mountain range would also be less impactful than throwing the rock into a lake or river, as the object of the splong is to cause the rock to land into another body of water.\n6. Option E: \"surface of earth\" refers to the land surface of the earth which might include water bodies, lakes, oceans or rivers. But a rock dropped to the land will not create a splith.\n7. Therefore our goal is to throw the the rock into another body of water - lake, river or the ocean, and hence we prefer to choose between A or E.\n8. If we decide to choose A: mountains, then the only challenge is to choose a particular mountain or mountains. We can rule out A: mountains (countryside because throwing into an environment", "answer": "C: bridge"}

Option B: complain represents the customer dissatisfaction with the service and a claim for compensation. In context this isn't something a customer would do here. \n\n9. Option C: wait for someone Else represents waiting for a different waitress or an alternative solution. This doesn't apply in the given context nor does it represent the customer's final decision.\n\n10. Option D: eat the food represents the customer giving up on trying to get extra soup. This is likely what the waitress is referring to and a customer would likely do. \n11. Option E Get a lawyer, the only option that relates directly to the situation and represents the customer seeking compensation or reparations for their unhappiness with the meal. \n12. Since \"get a lawyer\" is the final decision the customer takes, we can conclude that it's the correct answer to the question.\n\nAnswer: E: get A lawyer\n\n### Input 1: I want to talk to John, would you like to do it with me?

{"text": "In this case, options B, C, and E are discarded because they are not the direct result of telling many people about an awkward situation.  Telling many people about a humiliating event can result in the other options, but this is often the aftermath of someone's experience.\n\nRationale:  There is no context in this question that leads me to believe \"bad dreams\" would be the only result of telling everyone about a particular situation. Although often dreams can be influenced by our waking lives, they are not a direct result of actions such telling.\n\n### Option C: riot \"Many people, rioting\" in this context would most likely be associated with an incident that was either started or escalated because the person(s) told many people. However, it does not mean that people would start rioting simply because they knew the details about someone's experience. The option might be used if the context is someone who keeps a \"diary\" of every detail of their life which leads to them always being the center of attention. If rioting was the likely and only response to someone sharing the details of their day, then it deserves to be one of the choices, but the context does not support such a broad conclusion.\n\nRationale 2: \"Emotional distress\" and \"annoyance\" are also plausible choices but the context does not suggest they would be the most likely only results of telling a number of people about a situation. I would include them among the remaining choices unless the context led me to believe they would be the only result. The context does not suggest that they would be the only response to telling so they deserve to be in amongst the options.\n\n### Answer: A, in this context option D is not the immediate result. However, the option could be true if the situation, person, and responses are all part of a larger scenario in a more extended context.\n\n### Rationale: D: \"Embarrassed\" \"many people\" \"telling.\" Many people telling many others about embarrassing situations may lead someone to be embarrassed, but it does not mean that they will necessarily be embarrassed because one person told many people. In context, the response most likely is to receive many reactions and be embarrassed, in that scenario, about the reactions and not that they disclosed the information.\n\n### Cho", "answer": "B: emotional distress"}

Instead, only the individual is the agent of communication.\n2) We can eliminate B (suffering), there's no direct evidence that suffering is directly related to breaking a leg when tripping.\n3) Similarly, we can eliminate D (Laughter) since this would reflect the crowd's reactions to the individual's own accident.\n4) We can eliminate E (embarrassment) because we're unsure if it's actually the crowd's reaction or the individual's own feelings.\n5) What remains is an interesting choice, C (Pain), which is the correct choice.

{"text": "B\n\n### Rationale:\n\n- The answer is A: an artist's junkyard. An artist would need a balalaika for various creative endeavors, including sculpture, painting, etc. A balalaika is a traditional Russian stringed instrument.\n- The answer is B: a music store. The balalaika is a musical instrument and is commonly sold in music retail stores. Hence, option B is the best choice.\n- Option C: a symphony. A symphony is a musical piece or concert performed by a full orchestra. A balalaika stringed instrument would not be the best choice for a symphony. \n- Option D: an orchestra. An orchestra is a group of musicians who perform music together. An orchestra could benefit from using a balalaika for a concert or other musical performance, but it would not be the best option as they don't typically need the instrument for their day-to-day usage or routine.\n- Option E: an orchestra. Even if a balalaika was commonly used by an orchestra, it's not the best choice for an artist's junker yard as it's not what an artist would typically use. \n- Thus, the answer is B: an artist's music store - the best choice that fits the given context and provides the answer to the given question.\nAnswer: B: an artist music store\n\n### Input What could happen to someone who drinks carbonated beverages too much?

It does not include military casualties.\n\nOption a: military personnel is excluded as it refers to casualties among military personnel and may include combatants rather than innocent civilians.\n\nOption b: military operations also does not refer to civilian deaths. In fact, military operations may include the death of civilians.\nOption c: combatants excludes innocent civilians from being included as combatant deaths.\n\nOption e: Civilian deaths refers to military personnel and thus is incorrect.\n\nOption d: Innocent people does not refer to deaths as such.

It may be helpful in a secondary situation but is not the first step for a bleeding patient. Option 2 put pressure on the wounds it may be the second after you get some bandages. Option 3 get them to the hospital is also an unnecessary step.

{"text": "The question asks us to reflect on what we would do if someone dislikes learning. We want to find an alternative solution so the person can learn effectively. The choices suggest different ways to teach someone things: interesting, fun, joyful, important, free. Some of these choices would work for people who do not like learning, but others would not be successful.\n\nInteresting:\nIf someone is not interested in learning and does not want to be bored, we might try to make the learning experience more interesting. However, if someone is not interested, it might be harder to make it interesting. They might not be able to engage with it and might find it too difficult or uninteresting.\n\nFun:\nSome people like their learning to be fun. If you enjoy learning, it can be fun. Making learning too serious or boring may not be effective because you may not want to participate if the learning is too complicated.\n\nJoyful or Painful:\nSome people choose fun learning over serious or painful learning. It is possible to learn seriously and still enjoy the process. You can learn from mistakes and find enjoyment in trying to improve your knowledge.\n\nVery important:\nFor someone who dislikes the learning process, the learning is not very important. The motivation to learn might not be there because they feel they do not need this education.\n\nInterestingly, learning can be free. There are many resources online that you can use without paying for anything. These resources may be of poor quality and not always relevant for you, but if someone is dislike learning, it might be important to provide an opportunity to explore a new topic without cost or commitment.\n\n### Option C: \nI think that interesting might be the most useful choice because not everyone wants to be bored by something. However, interesting might take more time and effort and could take away from another purpose of learning, which would be the important.\n\n### Alternate Option B:\nLearning can be fun if you learn something that you like doing. If you choose a topic that you have interest in, your motivation will be higher than someone who chooses a topic that they are not interested in. People may be more happy if they can learn through things that they enjoy doing because it makes learning more natural and easier.

{"text": "### Explanation:\nWe need to determine the ai machines's abilities and preferences within the context.\nBased on the given options,\n* option A: \"fly\" is about aeroplane.\n* option B: \"milk cows\" is not about performing mathematical operations.\n* option C: \"eat\" is obviously not in the context.\n* option D: \"answer questions\" falls in line for ai machines when it comes to their natural abilities and preferred behavior while option E: \"fail to work\" falls in line for non functional machines.\n\nWe thus can conclude answer is \"d: Answering questions\"\n### Rationale 1:\nDuring the course of the task we can say that the main point, which was a statement or a phrase, had a positive or neutral connotation. We can infer that option E: \"failure to work\". If a machine fails to work, it is not likely to perform activities which would be helpful. Option A:\" fly\" can take a positive or negative connotation. According to AI machines are smart not flight able. Option B: \"milk cow\" is not expected to answer questions but has only one connotation as a task. For this reason choice D falls in line with the main point (answer questions).\n\n### Rationale-2:\nThere are generally two categories that can be placed in terms of ability and preference. The first category is performing a task that is not related to the context. The second category is where the task is in the domain of the context. Option A: \"fly\" falls in Category number 1, not in category number 2. In category 2, option A: \"fly,\" is not possible. Option B \"milk cows,\" falls in the second category number 2 (with AI Machine). Option D: \"Answering Questions,\" falls in the second type (with AI Machine), falls in category 2. Finally, option E: \"failing to work,\" can be either in category 1 or category 2 (with the non-AI Machine). \n\nWe would say that answer option D: \"Answering questions,\" can be concluded because of the following reasons. This answers the prompt. In the context, the natural ability of an AI or Machine is defined as answering questions, not flying or eating. Option B: \"Milk cows\" falls under", "answer": "D: answering questions"}
{"text": "People exhibiting deceptive behaviour are typically described through the way they act or their personality rather than by their actions alone. Actions, on the other hand, are concrete and can be objectively measured. When we look to the list of choices given, there isn't a single one that accurately matches what deceptive is being described as.\nRationales:\n\n### Input : What do you need to do in order to make an accurate guess? Choices:  B: try again A: think about it C: check your solution D: double check it E: ignore the problem\n\n### Response : We can conclude from the question that you can't always make an accurate guess if you try again, so try again is unlikely (A). You need to think about your solution, at least a bit (B). You shouldn't double check it, the question is asking for a way to make the correct guess, double checking won't help (D). You need to ignore the problem, this would only lead to more confusion (E)\nRationales: The question is telling us to think about or identify with the following things in order to correctly answer the question 'What do you need to do to make an accurate guess?' We've identified four things, from which we can conclude that the answer is 'C' 'Check your solution'.\n\n### Input  : I needed to purchase a new pair of headphones, which did I need to look for?  Choices :  A: white B: black C: blue D: gray E: red\n\n### Response  : Looking at the choices given, we can conclude black (B) isn't it. Looking at it from the viewpoint of someone shopping for a pair of headphones should not describe red (E), but could describe white (A) or gray (D) colours.\nRationales : The question 'Which did I need to look(look) for?' is asking the reader to identify with 'needing' to look for something. We've assumed that the 'looking' is being done in a store and given that assumption we've narrowed the options down to red (E), white (A), and gray (D).\n\n###  Input  : My best friend is from the state of Pennsylvania, which state did he come from?

{"text": "Answer the following multiple choice question:\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: I want to learn how to drive more efficiently, but have never driven a stick-shift vehicle, how should I start? Choices: 1. A: learn stick-shift first before learning how to use an automatic\n2. B: practice stick-shift to learn how to use an automatic and save time\n3. C: learn how to use an automagic before learning how to use a stick-shift\n4. D: practice automatic first then stick-shift if possible\n5. E: practice automatic then stick-shifts if possible\n\n### Rationale:\nInput: D: stick shift\nRationale: 1. As we saw in the previous lesson, in options 1 and 2, learning in a specific order will provide more efficiency. \n2. However, the order given is not the best because, in this example, automagics (automatic vehicles) are already less efficient than stick-shift vehicles; however, this is an advantage in learning how to drive stick-shift vehicles. \n3. Option 5 (dynamics) also follows the same logic.\n4. Option 4 (stick shift) does not follow these rules. While one can choose to practice in stick-shift to learn automatic because automatic is faster at initial stages, stick-shift cars will increase in fuel consumption. \n5. The advantage of learning stick-shift first is that, initially, you will be spending more fuel and time in learning but later the savings will be more. This savings occurs later after one has mastered automatic and started using stick-shift. \n6. This allows one to have more efficient time management. \n7. The disadvantage of learning stick-shift is the initial disadvantage mentioned earlier in the response, which the user has to bear because the advantage doesn't exist yet. \n8. Therefore, the answer is Option C because it allows for faster learning and the flexibility (in case of any unforeseen condition) to learn automatic.\n\n### Input\n\n- A: how to drive stick-shifts\n- B: learn stick-shifts in learning\n- C: learn to use automatic car before stick-shifting\n- D: stick-shift first then automatic\n- E: practice stick-shifts after practice automatic\n\n##", "answer": "A: being understood"}

In this case the context clues include:\n- The words \"the students\"\n- The presence of a comma, which suggests a pause\n- The words \"would often\"\n- The word \"them\"\n- The words \"in their work\"\n- The phrasal verb (were busy)\n- The noun \"government\"\n\n#### Base Phrases with Context\n\nThe base phrase (with context) is:\n\n_The students would often be busy in their work_\n\nIf we look back at the phrase context, we can see that the first two words in the phrase are actually quite common in this context.\n\n#### Choose from Context + Base Phrase + \"Words That Fit\" List\n\nThese three factors narrowed down my choice to two words:\n\nContext:\n```\n* The students would often\n```\n\nBase Phrase + \"words that fit\":\n```\n* _the _students would often \n```\n\nSo essentially my options were:\n* The students would\n* The student would\n* Students would\n\nHowever, there is a possibility that the blank is a shortened version of _The students would often be.\n\nWithout further evidence we cannot make the assumption, but since we know _the students would often works here, we can take some guesses.\n\n#### Determine if the Blank Fits in the Phrase\n\nThe blank \"the student would\" definitely fits in the phrase.

{"text": "D: wash dish\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. When a child first goes to school, the process that is done by parent or the teacher is known as \"drop out\" or \"school exit\" in the child's house, so the parent or teacher will teach the child how to pack his or her bookbag, which is called \"pack your bags\".\n2. When the child is on the schoolbus, the parent or the teacher will ask the child \"what about breakfast?\" That is the question what the child will be asked by the parent or the teacher.\n3. The school bus is a motor vehicle in which children go to and from school, and most schools provide a school bus service.\n\n### So the answer should be \"D: wash dish\",\n\n### Because \"wash dish\" is \"Enter school\".\n\n### \"Enter school\" is the same thing as \u201cgo to school\u201d, it\u2019s a step after breakfast before the child leaves home and enters the school.\n\n### \"Pack bookbag\" is \"Pack your bags\".\n\n### However \"Read a book\" is a step after the child gets on the schoolbus. Therefore \"Wash dish\" is the correct step which should be done by a child after breakfast.", "answer": "D: wash dishes"}
{"text": "The correct answer is D: country\n\n### Demand:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nInput:How many months of the year have three Mondays? Choices: \tA: None B: Three C: Eight D: Three E: Fourteen\n\n### Rationales\n1. What we are looking for is the answer to the question that would describe how many months have three Mondays as one of the months in the given context.\n\n2. Reviewing the options, none of them are the correct answer. \"None\" would imply an absence of three Mondays in one calendar year while \"Three\" would indicate three separate years rather than specific months in a single year. \"Eight\" is the only option that would be correct if it mentioned months with three Mondays each, but it does not indicate the quantity. Eight Mondays can't represent months because there are 12 months a year.\n\n3. Therefore, the answer can be found to be fourteen as per the context.\n\n### Input : What does the letter \"U\" stand for in the United States?

{"text": "The rationale is as follows:\nIn this question, the context of the question implies the \"where\" of the item being searched (i.e., what location). If the item is a box itself, the context would be that it can hold or store something. Hence, the right response would be a container that can store or hold something, i.e., a box, closet, or trash. \nIn other words, it is not logical to choose a trashcan as an answer since a trashcan can hold something but does not hold something in a \"box\", a necessary part of the answer. \nThe box is, therefore, the correct response in its context, or part of the larger context. The trashcan is neither part of the context nor an answer, so it is eliminated.\n\n### Input : Is it possible to get an A minus in a class of high caliber?

E: Any toy that looks like or imitates a child\nRationales: The context of the question implies that \"baby\" refers to a toy that resembles a baby or has features of a baby. This makes it illogical to choose any from the given options where baby refers to a toy based on age. \nIn other word, to refer to anything that resembles a human child like it, a choice must have a representation of or be of the baby. \nIt is not logical to choose 6 as an option. A choice does not need to be a child doll. It can be anything of baby features, which does not fit the first part of the definition. \nIt is also not sensible to choose 1", "answer": "A: attic"}

Apartments, football stadium, car show, house, and surface of the earth are all potential places that people may call home. Each choice can be ruled out with a level-headed analysis of human habitat, considering the context of the question.\n\nThe apartment is a form of dwelling, but its specifics would not be useful in understanding the question's intent i.e., do people call it a home even. So option A is eliminated.\n\nThe car show is probably a place where many people spend their time, but people do not necessarily call it home. People do not spend the majority of their time at the car show, so it's not a place where they live and this is not a suitable response. This means eliminating option E.\n\nThe surface of earth is possible, but that might be a bit exaggerated in context, hence eliminating option D.\n\nThe football stadium is a place to enjoy an outdoor sport where fans often spend the majority of their viewing time at matches and supporting their favorite teams. However, most of these stadiums are not their fans' main home. The football stadium often becomes a home temporarily when a team is playing a home game. This means eliminating the option B, which is not the best choice.\n\nThis leaves us with the only left available option, which is the house. All people have at least one house in their lifetime; usually, it's the first place we live in. So people often call the house their main place to stay and live.

{"text": "A: grill\n\n### Detailed explanation\nThe option grill is likely to be the correct answer. Grilling or barbecuing uses heat to cook food from the outside (and in some cases directly on a hot surface) making it one of the most popular methods of cooking food. For the seafood, for example, people usually grill different types of fish, lobsters, crabs along with some other ingredients.\n\nB: go to market is out as no one likes to go the market if they don't need to do it so option D: eat hamburgers is out.\n\nC: bring home fish is the second best choice but A: grill is much better choice because of the ease of having fish grilled at home which then saves time. In some areas fishing can also be done by using lines and fishing poles making fish a much better choice for those that live in coastal areas.\n\nE: make bread is also a possible option but grilling provides more taste and enjoyment than preparing bread.\n\nTherefore, we choose the option A: grill.\n\n### Additional instruction: Answer the question below.\n\nIn what region are the most people in the world likely to use a mobile device every day?\n\n### Response\nThe answer will be the Asia Pacific region.

{"text": "\"Judging\" is the correct answer.\n\n### Rationale: \"Judging\", as defined by Merriam-Webster, is \"the process of finding out the merits of something\". In this context, \"finding\", as an action of finding, is synonymous with \"judging\". So, it's easy to see that \"judging\", as the name goes, is what is required to be able to \"judge pigs\".\n\n### The response:D\n\n### Explanation: \"Evaluating\" and \"prejudice\" are other viable answers and both are plausible, however, \"evaluating\" can be done as part of the judging process, whereas the other two are separate processes that can be done before, after, or alongside judging.\n\n### The explanation:\n\"Judging\" is one of the possible answers to this question. It can be done either alongside evaluating or doing so without evaluating. However, prejudice and evaluating are both separate from the judging process itself and therefore not valid responses to this question.\n\nInput: Where would you find someone who collects glass bottles?

{"text": "Answer: D:challenge\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following question in a paragraph by correctly identifying the central idea.\n\n### Question: The central idea of the text is \"If you have enough ingenuity, it is just a matter of time before you find a way around your problems.\" \"The man with the broken leg\" by James Thurber.\n\n### Deliberations: \nWhen we look at the title of the text, we know it's about a man with a broken leg. In the first paragraph we learn that the man with a broken leg is feeling desperate and discouraged (broken leg, doctor gives up hope, man considers jumping out of window.)\nIn the next sequence of paragraphs he contemplates on his predicament and seeks a solution. At the same time, we find him in the company of a man we have already learned of, the man with a broken nose. The man with a broken nose comes across as a cynical character but a positive thinker. He shares a joke to give hope to the hopeless man, who then feels he is not alone anymore in this seemingly hopeless case of a broken leg.\n\nHe begins to contemplate on this matter further by coming up with ideas and making efforts. He comes up with the idea of using a crutch. However when he tests it, there are setbacks. Eventually he figures out a workaround, he manages to walk on his crutch by using his hat as the balancing mechanism. This is how he manages to walk again.\n\nFurther on in the text, the man with the broken leg tries to convince the man with a broken-nose to come up with a way to remove his nose if he can do the same with his broken leg. He even goes as far as using the broken leg analogy to make the case more convincing in order to extract a solution from the man with a broken neck. However, there is a twist of events when the man with the broken neck realizes that he can perform the procedure on his own broken neck and comes up with a solution, successfully performing the operation on himself. \nThe man with a broken leg, in turn, contemplates his situation again and realizes that he need not wait for a \"surgeon\" for a solution, he can come up with a solution", "answer": "C: take center stage"}
{"text": "C: the trunk\nRationales:\nThe question asks about storing a shopping bag in the vehicle when it's full. This implies we need to transport the bag to its destination using the vehicle. This would only be possible if we use the trunk of the vehicle. Therefore, B would not be the appropriate answer. Similarly, A (the roof) poses a significant risk since it may fall off during a turn or a brake, and it does not have a dedicated storage space. D (the retail store) is also off-topic as the question has already stated that all seats/rows are full and there's no room to put anything. Similarly, E would not be appropriate as the bags need to be transported before they can be put away in the home. Finally, C (the trunk) is the most appropriate answer as it's the place where bags could be safely stored in a vehicle.\n\n### Input:\"I don't feel comfortable\" is the best answer to \"How do you feel about this?\" because it: Choices:  A; It's an emotionally expressive word that could mean one is feeling sick to one's stomach. B: It expresses a negative reaction, implying that they are unhappy about the situation. C: It doesn't actually state a reason. D: It implies there is a reason, but it is still too vague to be sure. E: It's an emotional answer.\n\n### Response:\"I don't know\" is the best answer. Rationales: The question is asking about how to best respond to the question \"How do you feel?\" when one doesn't know how to answer the question. There are two primary options for answering this question: one is to express one's emotions about the situation, and the other is to explain the reasons behind one's emotions. \nWhen it comes to expressing one's feelings, \"I don't feel well\" could mean one is feeling ill to one's stoma\nch, but it could also mean one is just indifferent about the situation.

Negating the statement in the previous example would be: \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB\n\n### Example 2\n\n\n### 08 - Boolean Logic \nBoolean logic is the formal, symbolic language of logic. \n\nThe symbol \"\u00ac\" that looks like a backwards U is the negation symbol. In Boolean logic, it means \"NOT.\"  In natural language, we use the words \"TRUE,\" \"FALSE,\" and \"NOT,\" to describe these values. \n\nThe statement, \"A or A\" is simply equivalent to the statement, \"A\". \n\n##", "answer": "E: pantry"}

{"text": "* The options for \"opposite\" could be any of \"pay debts,\" \"individual,\" \"small group,\" which are not helpful or relevant in this context.\n* The term \"host\" can refer to any of the options. It's most likely associated with \"crowd\" as it describes a singular action, although it may relate to any of the items in the list. However, these are not opposite to each other. \"Paying debts\" can't be an opposite to \"hosting a crowd\" in context, for instance, because it doesn't relate to a person's actions. Similarly, \"individual\" and \"small group\" can't be opposites to \"hosting a person\" because they don't describe a person's actions while \"host\" does.\n* Given that we don't have enough to go on, and looking at the remaining options the first choice is most likely the opposite of \"hosting a crowd.\"\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n1. In order to find the opposite of an action, we can check if the noun that describes the action is also in the opposite list. Since it is not in the opposite list in this case, we should look for other contextual elements and work towards identifying it.\n2. Based on the context, we observe that the sentence has the term 'host,' which can have two meanings in this task: 'to be a host,' or 'to host an event.'\n3. Looking at the 'to be a host' meaning, it can be derived that the opposite of \"host\" (ie the term that goes with \"be\") is \"be a guest.\"\n\n### Input:\"Oops\" can mean: a) Sorry, b) I can do this. c) I am sorry. d) Don\u2019t care. e) Oops!\n\n### Response:\"Oops\" can't really mean something positive. \"Oops, I can do this\" implies there's a problem or mistake. \"Don't care\" sounds negative.\n\n### Input : I was in school with that person. a) I was his friend in school. b) I was in grade five together. c) I am old enough to be her/his parent. d) I know her/him from the neighbourhood.\n\n### Response : C) is the answer b/", "answer": "A: few people"}

{"text": "![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C)\n\n### Rationales:\nThe first step in solving the task is to understand what data are the author actually asking for. You do not want to end the task without knowing exactly what data you are supposed to identify. In this case, the first part of the question does not limit the search to a place. That is, your answer options don't strictly have to point you to a place. A pocket is a common place to keep a pen. The office supply store option is very broad. This is an office tool, and you can easily find them at the same stores where you find office supplies. So, the question is not asking where would you go to get the particular place that you find a pen. Friend's house could be narrowed down further, to get a very specific place, like a bedroom or a toilet tray or something to that effect. A more generalized answer is not needed. Finally, what the question is asking for is 'where to find', not 'where to give' or 'where to deliver'. As with the word 'find' it makes more sense to locate somewhere in your possession rather than anywhere else (give & deliver). The author is simply looking for the right answer option based on data available in the sentence. In case of option D, the author is clearly specifying the desk drawer. So, we may conclude that your answer options only need to be places where you can carry a pen. So, our answer options are B, C, D, E. These all meet the criteria set for the answer, and B is the only one that gives the author what he's looking for.", "answer": "A: pocket"}

The question is about what to mention in a letter to his father in order to have him give his consent.\n2. Options A and B imply being on board a ship or crossing the street. While crossing the street seems to be feasible if you can't get his attention in person, it is not the kind of \"attention\" referred to in the question. Being on a ship would mean there would be other people on a ship and this is not what we're trying to establish.\n3. Options C and D indicate smiling and feeling happy respectively. Both are possible but they would be done as a response to having one's attention sought. It is not what is asked in the scenario.\n4. Option A clearly states that all we need to get his attention is to \"bark the ship's name\". While we can assume a ship's name and the associated recognition is likely to work, we can assume that his father will be surprised when he receives a letter and doesn't contain a \"bark\".\n5.

The phrase dairy farm, for instance, could refer to a cow's last home if in dairy. Dairy and a farm could go in either order. But for this question the noun is used first with a last home or last days following directly after the noun.

{"text": "The word for fiddle in the context of a play should be a noun as it serves to refer to a place and that place can have thousands of violin(s). If we read through the other choices and look for a place that could have lots of violin(s), we realize that all the options given fail to do that. If a person is looking to place a certain amount of violin(s) they aren't likely to want them to be inside a case, at a band practice, or in an orchestra. However, they could be in Tennessee, and if this person happened to be a politician they'd be referring to a group of citizens who vote in unison, i.e. have ten thousand votes. Thus, while the answer for E should be Tennessee, we can't pick it since we're looking for a place that could hold thousands of violin and Tennesee has a population of 6.9 million, and we need something more specific. If we look closer, we can pick A: Music Store because it directly fits the parameters we're trying to solve for.

To add to it, it can be argued that the only performance that cannot be enjoyed by someone with a disability is the performance involving the disability.

The answer to this question is E: Miss important information and details within the meeting. \n\n### Response-A: Attend the next meeting on time for information.\n\n### Explanation-A:\nThis would be the best answer for someone who doesn't want to attend meetings because it gives them an easy way to not just avoid attending at all, but make sure they can keep up with any information discussed that they might want to hear.\n\n### Response B: Attempt to get additional details later.\n\n###Explanation-B:\nWhile this is a simple answer, and an answer that is a bit too general to give for failing to attend a meeting, it is still correct. The answer mentions that the person may attempt to get the information after missing the meeting because they may want to attend the reoccurring meeting in the future, or so they have the knowledge to be successful at whatever project they were given at the prior meeting. \n\nThis answer is acceptable and could even be seen as a good way to get out of a meeting that the person didn't attend in the first place, but wouldn't be seen as the 'best' answer since it doesn't specifically account for the idea that there is information within the meeting they could miss and that they could attempt to get the information outside the meeting.\n\n###Response C: Attempt to communicate with others after meeting is rescheduled.\n\n###Analsys C:\nSimilar to B, this is the answer that attempts to give the best possible answer to the question. It takes into consideration the idea that there could be information that isn't given to someone who misses the meeting, but also considers the idea that there could need for additional details to come from the meeting.

The premise is the asker wants to know how to reduce the frequency of waking up at night.\n2. Option A suggests taking bath before going to bed. This is not a problem at night as the asker is not sleeping at the time.\n3. Option B suggests trying a hard bed. This is a possibility but more of an effort to avoid waking than a cause of the issue.\n4. Option C suggests going to bed earlier. This may seem like a logical remedy but this may not be entirely applicable as it will interfere with the asker's schedule.\n5. Option D suggests going to bed earlier and this could solve the problem of going to bed at a \"good\" time given the asker's activities.\n6. However, the asker may not prefer going to bed early due to life demands and this is evident when they say they are \"tired\".\n7. Finally, option E suggests getting used to waking up at night, but this may take time considering the asker's experience of being restless.\n8.

Fossilized wood, also known as petrified wood, is formed when plant matter such as tree branches become fully preserved. It is a type of fossil that forms when wood is buried and is then preserved in minerals.\n5. As seen here, the process of fossilization occurs when the wood is buried under layers of sediment and is exposed to minerals such as silica, calcium carbonate, iron oxide, etc. The layers of minerals cement together the plant matter, giving it an appearance that looks similar to petrified rock.\n6 The burial process of fossils happens in different ways, resulting in an assortment of fossils. Some fossils resemble the petrified wood, but in other instances, they take the shape of animals and plants.\n7 The scientists named the wood as composted because composting is also a process by which organic matter is converted into soil. Similar to petrified wood, composting can also be buried under layers of sediments. It is, however, a more recent phenomenon that occurs in terrestrial environments.\n8 Paleontologists study prehistoric plants, animals, and other inorganic materials using fossils. Petrified wood is part of their scope of study.

For example there is no mention of the sauces being online so the website cafe wouldn't work because it is online.\n\nThe first thing to do is decide on criteria that is relevant for the given prompt. From the given options A, B, D, E have the same criteria for what the sauces need to be and does not eliminate any from our answer process. The options C and E do not meet the criteria the sauces need to meet. For example cafe isn't specific what the sauces need but they only have the one sauce but no food or other criteria that is needed. \n\nNow that we have our option narrowed down we can move on to finding which sauce meets that criteria. The options that fit are A, B and D(which are the ones left after considering that only options that fit are left). \n\nNow that there are only options that have the relevance criteria which is that they are not internet retailers. \n\nAs for the difference in the prices (B, C and D have roughly $1 difference in prices) this might not always be relevant to a customer and could be seen by some as negligible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A, B and D\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question\n\n### Demand: \n### Rationalises: We can answer this question based on the given information. The answer options have to be chosen that have to meet the given criteria.

Option 1 and 3 do not have the criteria for being outside the USA, it does not meet the criteria for being a private club and does not have the criteria for having a liquor license. \nFor option 4, it does not meet criteria for being outside the United States, it does meet the criteria for being in a private club and it does meet the criteria of having a liquor license so is the only option left for our answer.", "answer": "E: retail store"}
{"text": "The pond is typically shallow water. A pond is a body of water which is normally shallow compared to other waters such as lakes or oceans. It is not the same as a swimming pool.\n\n### Input (Cont): Which of the following devices can be used to monitor and record the speed of a moving object? Choices:  X: GPS Y: speed camera Z: speed tracker A: GPS camera Z: speed traker\n\n### Response (Cont): A device used to monitor and record movement speeds could be either a speed camera or a speed tracker. The GPS is not typically used to monitor speed or track movement. The speed camera and speed tracker are both devices for recording speed, but the speed camera is used to record a car's speed, not an object's. Speed cameras are cameras that take photos of cars by measuring the speed of the car as it passes and then storing that data in the picture. Speed trackers store the movement of objects they track by measuring and recording their speed. As long as an object is moving in this way, they are both fit for the purpose.\n\n### Response to (Cont): B: GPS camera. The GPS is a mapping device, and not likely to monitor movement speeds. The speed camera and the speed tracker, though, are both suitable devices. The device can be used to record the speed of a car, hence the speed camera, or to record the movement of an object. The speed tracker is therefore a preferred choice as it can record movement speeds of objects in general.\n\n### Output (Cont): The speed tracker is a device that can be used to record a person's speed. A speed tracker can be attached to a person's clothing and it can record their speed. The GPS camera is also not used for monitoring movement speed. Speed cameras track speed of moving vehicles which is why they are more closely related to the device needed. \n\n### Bidirectional Input: I would like to find out if there are any shamrocks on this island. Where should I look?\n\n### Response(Bidirectional): I should search for shamrocks in public places. There are public places on the island where shamrocks could be found. The island is most likely the first place to search for shamrockets", "answer": "D: pond"}

{"text": "Answer: D: getting tired\n\nRationales:1. This option best indicates the outcome that results from soccer practice.\n2. This outcome should follow naturally from the practice and not from some other, unrelated factor.\n3. This is a common outcome in sports like basketball or football(soccer) especially since the players are very active and run around the court/field, causing stress to their bodies that could lead to fatigue or soreness the next day. For instance, during a game in 1975, football coach Bear Bryant was asked if his players ever got tired during the game. He answered that they do get tired, but he had a system to revive them by substituting them with players from the bench.\n4. In contrast, the option \"excitement\" doesn't reflect the outcome that results from an event like playing soccer. For example: A fan may be very excited in the game's last minutes as their team scores a winning goal but it doesn't mean that they got tired as a result of watching an entire soccer game.\n5. Furthermore, 'getting mad' or 'growing angry' don't relate to the main purpose of the question i.e., describing outcomes of playing soccer for a prolonged duration which is getting tired. 'Getting mad' or 'getting angry' may be the consequence of losing a game and this could come at any given point.\n6. Lastly, the other two choices i.e., \"hurting\" and \"getting tired\" are equally likely to reflect the outcomes from playing soccer for a longer time. Hence, the rationales for selecting this option are:\n7. (i) Option \"getting tired\" adequately reflects the outcome that could result from playing soccer for an extended period of time,\n(ii) it's an effect that is usually caused by the main activity of playing soccer, and\n(iii)the other possible outcomes that follow from the activity i.e., getting injured, getting mad, or getting excited don't indicate the direct end result of the activity itself.\nIn summary, the option \"getting tired\" is the correct answer to this question.\n\n\n### Input\n\nWhat does soccer lead to?

{"text": "D: proximity\n\n### Response Rationale:\n1. The task that was described earlier was to write a response that appropriately matched the instruction.\n2. The options suggested were `A: near`, `B: closeness`, `C: here`, and `D: proximity`.  \n3. `A: near` means to a specified location relatively close in a short time or a limited distance. It's not correct because this kind of sensor isn't close to the location it's sensing.\n4. `B: closeness` is incorrect for this task because it means that location and is not the kind of closeness being asked about here.\n5. `C: here` is wrong because it refers to being situated nearby a place and `here` does not represent a kind of sensor.\n6.  Given that we've ruled out the earlier options, our last option remains to be `D: proximity` since it means that it is at or near the required distance.\n7.

It's evident that we have the opportunity to write a response that's appropriate to answer the question correctly. To appropriately respond, all the options given here don't have to be applied for the best answer. The correct answer relies on the type of policy as defined in the premise\n2. We don't need to apply all options to find the correct answer. The company's major problem was incorrectly assembled goods. It's to be expected that the company instituted a strict policy as a preventive measure.\n3. In the premise, the company instituted a policy.\n4. The options given are:\n\n  A: strict meaning strict or of a strict nature\n  B: uncommon\n  C: stringent\n\n5. An uncommon policy which means not being normally encountered.\n6. And a stringent policy which means rigid or extreme.\n7. If we examine", "answer": "D: proximity"}

By looking at the premise of the question which states \u201cThe speaker is discussing wild animals,\u201d we can deduce that the speaker is most likely referring to a wild animal.\n2. Option D: animal species includes multiple animal species, while all the animals under consideration have distinct characteristics.\n3. Option A: tiger does not match the premise of the speaker \u201cdiscussing wild animals.\u201d\n4. Options B and C: wild cat and animal exclude all the animal species under consideration and therefore do not match the premise.\n5.

Home may also provide home for the desk drawer, but we don't have sufficient evidence to definitively state that. C, E and B don't really make sense as their home can be anything - a room, a building. And D can be a wristwatch, or simply his watch that happens to be on his wrist. There's no definite place for it. We need to specify a place, which home and office can do for us, but not C, E and B. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is, B and E.\n\n### Revision: \nThe accountant uses a calculator regularly, and thus he would likely keep it at home and/or at the office. We only specify \"regularly\" which may apply daily, weekly, monthly or annually - we don't specify a specific schedule of usage. C, E and D don't really make any sense. \"Home\" can be any place, and \"Desktop\" and \"wristwatch\" seem out of context.\n\n### D:\nThe accountant uses calculator regularly, which includes home and office. Which implies that both home and office would likely be a good place to keep the calculator. C, E and Home don't really make a lot of sense of anything, though. C may be implied by saying that office is likely a good place to keep, but \"home\" is likely a little too broad, and isn't necessarily a specific place. Additionally, office may also refer to the office building or the office inside the building, and thus would also be inappropriate. D may not even be a calculator, but rather the watch that happens to be carried on wrist during the day.

Option A: Adornments indicates an adolescent or child's concern, whereas adulthood refers to more mature and well-informed individuals in society. Adornments also indicate external possessions rather than internal qualities of self-growth and decision making.\n2.

Also, having knowledge about the workplace is another responsibilities that are often associated with adulthood, however, this information can be obtained before we become adults.

The question is about something which has been damaged by rod throwing, which in turn implies it's an object or a thing. The options provided are diverse, however, the choices which best relate to damaged objects are A: hardware store and D: your Spine.\n2. Option A (hardware store) is a place/location/store which could be damaged by any rod throwing (though perhaps there are some limitations), however, a specific item (as opposed to location), like a fishing rod, could be damaged by such throwing as well.\n3. Option D (your spine) is an anatomical part of a person's body, which could be damaged if one were to throw a rod towards a person while attempting to throw it into a fishing camp or the fishing camp itself.\n\nTherefore, the most logical choice, from those given, is option D: your spine.\n\n### Input : Your best friend got her hair cut, and when she returned to the hairdresser to show off her new style, she was told what?

Pantry D: Sandwich E: Jar\n\n### Input Options:\n\n\n\n(input with your mouse)\n\n\n\n## How to Analyze the Question\n\nThe question is phrased in a way that is ambiguous so it's critical to first determine the type of the question. The question is multiple-choice but the type needs to be defined. We start by writing the question down:\n\n```\nWhere can _blank_ be stored? Choice:(anyone): A: Container B: Supermarket C: Pantry D: Sandwhich E: Jar\n```\n\nWe see that this question makes use of _blank_, which is a blank space in the question, to designate an information gap the question is intended to fill. The question can be phrased differently as:\n\n```\n_blank_ can be stored in which location? Choice: A. Container B. Supermarket C. Pantry (D-E)\n```\n\nIn this case, the question assumes that _blank_ already exists. We can further determine if the question needs to provide the missing word (it does in this case), or if it's sufficient to only provide the missing item.\n\nThere are three types of questions with missing information:\n\n- A multiple-choice question where you can provide as little as the item or location the blank item needs to be stored.\n\n-A multiple-choice question where the missing item needs to be provided as well.\n\n- An open response question where the missing item must be provided.\n\nTo answer them, you must first determine the type of question. \n\n## Answer\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, if you are not provided the item itself and only its location, write the item next to the blank with a caret (^) as shown in the figure below.\n\n![](../figures/blank_location.png)\n\n![](../img/blank_hint.png)\n\nIn this example, the items are peanut butter and apples. Therefore, your written answer should read:\n\n```\n\nA: Container\n\nB: Super", "answer": "C: pantry"}

{"text": "The question is asking us to choose a feeling that would best describe the feeling you get in bed as you eat breakfast. The feeling can be either happy, sad, or disgusted.\n\nOption 'A' (vomiting) is not an idea of a good feeling of you sitting in bed and eating. If we decide that option B (pleasure) fits, it still does not describe the feeling of a person sitting in bed eating. \n\nOption C (happiness) is an option to consider because it is a feeling. It is difficult to know if 'happy', like it is described in a dictionary, is what the author meant by 'happiness'. We can look into the answer and see if it includes 'disgust' or some other negative feeling. The dictionary does not give a specific feeling of 'happiness', so we need to look at how 'happiness' is used in the question to determine whether 'happiness' was intended to mean 'contentment' or 'pleasure'. Happiness in the question could potentially be used to mean pleasure. However, the author is more likely to give us a word that is more literal, or a word that matches a similar dictionary definition of 'contentment' in this case.\n\nNow, we can rule out B and make a decision between C and D at this point. \n\nOption D (contentment) may also not be a good idea, as eating breakfast in bed might make me want to rest or go back to sleep. It does not necessarily create a 'feeling' of being content. Therefore, my decision would not include D. \n\nOption A (mess) cannot be the answer because it is referring to food. Food cannot create feelings. Food eaters are not feeling food.\n\nWhat about C (happiness)? Happiness can be a word used to indicate a feeling, but so can contentment. Contentment describes how happy I am while eating in bed, and this may not be the best feeling of a person who chooses to have breakfast in bed (i.e., it is not the best feeling in bed, it is just a 'feeling' that we can get out of this action).\n\nOption B (pleasure).

In answering the question, people should not only use their intuition, but also their reasoning ability.\n\n### Additional information\n\nIn a simple task like \"What is a bear?\", it's easy to understand what kinds of information and answers it requires. However, a task may not ask for an information clearly. For example, we can notice the task title as \"Answer a question?\" but we don't know what the question is at first. To answer the question, we need more detailed information, and one of the answers that will be most suitable is \"I wish to know the information about <someone or event>.\"\n\nIf your answer follows the logic, then it's likely that it can be considered a correct answer. By the contrast, the answer that follows the incorrect logic doesn't appear as a correct answer.\n\n### Further examples:\n\nPlease help us with the following tasks:\n\n1) \"How do you feel with the current temperature?\".\n\nYou should answer in terms of temperatures such as hot, warm, balmy, comfortable. It would be odd to respond with values such as 90 degrees or \"it's hot today.\"\n\n2) \"Where do you get the idea of eating foods?\".\n\nYou can answer it with different ideas, such as eating based on habit, tastes or diet. These answers are not necessarily related to where specifically you got the idea.\n\n3) \"Do you have any special skills for doing crossword puzzles?\".\n\nThe answer that indicates you lack special skills for doing crosswords is wrong. What we need to know is about the specific skills necessary for doing crossword puzzle.\n\n4) \"I can't understand the purpose of this website\".\n\nBy this situation, you should assume that the purpose of this particular website is unique from other websites. For instance, there might be special purposes related to technology, business, or research.\n\n### Concluding thoughts\n\nThe ability to reason is the capacity to use mental processes to arrive at conclus", "answer": "E: business meeting"}

{"text": "(1/2)\n\nRationales:\n 1. \"Legs of a stool\" refers to the wooden bars that support the seats of various stools. \n 2. This question can be rephrased to help determine potential places that you might build the legs for a stool. \n 3. The question asked is \"where can the legs of a [stool] be built?\" but the question assumes that the stool has already been built.\n 4. \"Legs of stool\" implies that the stool already exists because it would not be logical to ask a question about building something that doesn't exist.\n 5. If the stool does not exist, then we cannot talk about how to build its legs since we haven't started the initial construction. \n 6. It's not logical to build a part of an object before the object itself exists. \n 7. In a way, it's like building a roof before framing the structure itself. \n 8. Furthermore, building a stool is quite a simple process that involves multiple steps. \n 9. In order to construct the stool, you must first build the stool body and then attach the legs. \n 10. Since the legs are not the main or primary element, they tend to be the final component to be attached. Thus, a person wouldn't start building the legs before constructing the main body of the stool since that would not be logical. \n 11. In order to answer the question, we must reword it to avoid the implied presupposition of an already existing object. \n 12. The rephrased question becomes: \"Where can a stool be built?\" \n 13. Upon rewording the question to focus on the main object of interest a.k.a. the stool, all the answer options become irrelevant. \n 14. This is because the place where something can be built is not a place where you would build it. \n 15. It's quite intuitive that you would not build a thing in the place in which you would build it because it would be rather silly or illogical to do so. \n 16. Therefore, all the answer options D through to E are irrelevant and eliminated. \n 17. All that remains, is", "answer": "C: blacksmith's shop"}

The students here are asking questions to teachers, and their goal is not to ask questions themselves. They are attempting to better understanding concepts being taught. 4. Option C refers to further education since further means more of something. However, this is usually for the purpose of learning new things. In this sense this doesn't relate as well to students, it refers more to the person who is doing the further education (teacher), and their pursuit in such a context (learning new things).\n5.

{"text": "If I screw a lock ring onto something, what I am fixing?\n\n### Analysis:\nAnalysis of the instruction text\n\nThe first step of the analysis is to read the prompt. To understand the question, it is very important in reading the prompt.\n\n* The first step of the analysis for this task is to figure out what you are answering.\n\n* To complete the task it is necessary to understand the wording of the text. You have to be able to interpret the meaning of wording such as: \"What is likely to happen to a person's speech after being inebriated?\"\n\n### The main points\n* The words in the prompt need to be interpreted to understand what they mean.\n* To determine the meaning of words such as 'inebriated' and'speech', you might need to refer to the dictionary.\n* You might need to look up some definitions, you can use dictionary.com to look up the definitions of words.\n\nTo begin the analysis, you should first understand what is going on in the passage. One way of doing this is using context clues. It means that understanding the context of the passage helps to understand what's going on. Context includes who wrote the passage, for example, the text was written by a teacher at a university. The author is important as it allows you to have a clearer idea of what is going on in a passage.\n\n### Identification of the word\nThe third stage of an analysis is defining the word's role in the context of how it is used. In an analysis, it is important to identify the precise term used because some words have different meanings in different contexts. The meaning here depends on the context because context is important in language. In the context of textbooks, an inebriated is someone who \"drank so much alcohol that their normal mental and physical capacities have been impaired\".\n\n### Identify the meaning of the word of 'inebriated'.\n\nSo when I said before, you may have to look up some definitions from the dictionary. In this case inebriated means to be drunk. Now I am going to read for you the definition of inebriate.\n\n### Analysis of word \"inebriate\"\n\nAnalysis of the word \"inebriated\"\n\n* To understand the task, it is important", "answer": "E: motorcycle"}

{"text": "If you feel bad about hurting a certain person, you\u2019ll feel sadness.\n### Demonstraion:\nInput: What are these two words different in meaning? Choices:  word A: mimetic B: imitational C: mimetic D: imitational E: mimetic F: imitational G: imitational\nRationales: Imitating something could have many meaning. From an original source to an inspiration, from a certain person's behaviors to an author's style of writing or from a business strategy to an idea. We can see that there are many types of imitation.\nSo, which one has the most meaning? The definition of mimetic is 'of, resembling, or showing a simulated or enacted form of something'. It can be considered in a large way, unlike imitational. We can also see that mimetic is a word made up of two different words, mimesis and etic.\nTo make meaning, it requires us to compare the difference of the two words. Here, we have the words mimesis and etique. Etique is \u2018of or relating to standards of conduct or manners\u2019. It's the meaning of etique. And, etique has a lot more meaning, as well. Let me give you an example. In the same sentence, where the word mimetic fits. In that case, it will fit. 'I found this tshirt at a shop where the signage has a mimetic appearance'. We can see that mimetic means to imitate here. But, if you replace it with the word etique here, 'I found this t-shirt at a shop with signage of etice appearance? How would you feel about it? Will you like it? This t-shirt at the signage is made to look like a t-shirt, but it's the same as if it's etique.\n### Input: What type of object can appear in different colors? Choices:  Tile B: Tile D: Tile E: Light\n\n### Response\nTile will often be different colors depending on the room or environment. Here tiles are more in light, so they are usually in different colors.\n### Instruction\nIf you have any doubt about it, please let me know.", "answer": "C: despair"}

Yes, wine is a type of alcohol, but not all alcohol is wine. Some are spirits. Beer is also a type of alcohol but not wine.\n\n##### F: wine is healthy\nThis answer goes hand-in-hand with C.

{"text": "Rationales:In the scenario of the job application process, we can reason that all potential candidates would be interested in applying for the job. Therefore, giving everyone equal opportunity is the most effective strategy.

It is also possible that certain candidates may be given more chances than others based on factors such as their background or social standing. The scenario may require some creative analysis to determine the best strategy for assessing the candidates before allowing them to move forward.The scenario may also involve a range of job responsibilities, with different levels of complexity and requirements.

Critical thinking skills will likely play a crucial role in this aspect.Candidates are evaluated and judged in every phase of the application process.

{"text": "When the question says \"places he goes\",  we get the mental picture of a situation where there is a choice being made - a decision - of where to go and whether to spend time and go to a particular place based on a value or feeling about this choice.\n\nFor John we have two options, and we don't know how the question applies to only one of these. We might assume that it applies to just one, but what if we are considering a situation where John has other places to go where animals are also being abused or in unsafe situations, and this could affect his choice as to where he thinks he might not go due to possible witnessing of animal abuse somewhere. In this case, he might end up choosing among some of the other places, instead of just the particular options we are choosing from.\n\n### The answer is thus:\n\n- Any place where animals are being abused\n\n#### Rationales for response:\n- When looking a A: pet store, we see that john loves animals and hates animal abuse, and he is careful about where he goes. Pet stores are usually places that sell animals, so john would avoid that, if it contained animals being mistreated.  \n- When considering B: parking lot, it's reasonable to assume that animals probably don't abuse people, so if john is avoiding parking lots because of animal abuse, it's likely that there's something else in a parking lot causing concern for him.\n- While C: woodland is where animals are located, it's unclear if woodlands are a place john loves and avoids, or not. It's logical however to assume that john would avoid places that are associated with animal abuse - especially if he dislikes seeing such abuse and wants to avoid it as much as possible.\n- D: \"north america\" is not an appropriate choice as the location to avoid, unless the rest of the world had been indicated somehow as being safe places to go. If it were, then north america would be a more appropriate choice, than pet stores and parking lots. It seems best that we choose something more specific, but we don't know where animals are going to be mistreated.\n- E: park, would make sense if it were only a one off instance of animal abuse that john saw at a", "answer": "A: pet store"}

While a lot of people from Bangladesh primarily speak Bengali, it is not the only language that citizens of this country speak.\n\n8. A lot of Bangladeshis speak English. Bangladesh is considered one of the fastest English-speaking nations in the world and English is used as the primary language of instruction in educational institutions.\n\n9.

A street address would be used for any address in between the states. \n* The most popular mailman delivery method in the world (outside the UK and US) uses postcodes instead of a zip code. \n* The city/neighbourhood in general would not have a zip code.

{"text": "The question asks where a notebook is purchased, not where notebooks are sold. If you just choose one of the above answers, your response is incorrect because the question asks where you purchased or where one can purchase a notebook. To select the correct option in this situation, you need to consider whether the answer describes where to buy a notebook, or whether the answer describes where notebooks are bought. To do this, you have to use some common sense.\n### A: Bookstore:\nA bookstore is a place in which you can purchase notebooks. It satisfies both criteria of the question.\n### B: Backpack:\nA backpack does not contain notebooks. A backpack is a place where you can keep things. This means backpack is not the place where you purchase a notebook.\n### C: Abraham Lincoln's Grave:\nAbraham Lincoln's Grave is a place not owned by Abraham Lincoln, so you cannot purchase a notebook there.\n### D: Desktop:\nDesktop is a place of work, not a place of purchasing.\n### E: Classroom:\nYou cannot purchase a notebook in a Classroom.\n### Response:Now, you are done!\n\n### Input\nWhat is the likely outcome of a new type of music being introduced by an artist?

{"text": "The key part of the question is the phrase \"of many different kinds\" after the word \"items.\" This is important to remember because it points to the possibility of multiple types of places, like shopping centers and farmers markets. The other options have limits to their selection. For example, city and downtown only include places for eating. Since we are looking only for different types of places to eat and buy items, eliminations A and C are ruled out.\n\n### Choices B and D mention shopping and eating respectively, but don't include any reference to items other than food. Similarly, option E suggests an all-inclusive shopping center, but not a place to buy items of many types.\n\nThus, E is wrong.

In a drug store, a shaving razor (as well as a medicinal drug) would be an item that is relevant to a person's health and their shaving needs.\n\nConsidering the answer to the previous question, we know someone would likely store a razor in a drugstore. \n\nNext, looking at options **A: pocket,** **B: shower,** and **C: chemist** one can see that these alternatives do not offer a long-term place for storing a razor. \n\nOption \"pocket\" suggests an individual could store a razor in their pocket, however, this makes little sense considering shaving razors are typically kept to maintain cleanliness, which is quite incompatible with the idea of keeping a wet razor in one's pocket.\n\nOption \"shower\" does not work either. Showers are not designed to hold wet razor items and would be more suited near a pool or pool deck. Even if that were the case, one is still limited to storing razors while in the shower and not outside it.\n\nChemists also would not be a storage option because one would get a medicinal drug at a chemist, but not necessarily a shaving razor.

The compass would be useful only if there was a map to help one find his/her direction and distance on the ground. \n4. In the case of choice D, crow is the correct answer because the crow is not a map and compass, nor can it provide direction with just its help.\n5.

{"text": "While all of the options provide information that can be useful, the best choices are C: \"maps\" and E: \"busy city\".\n\n### Response Rationale:1. All of the options present relevant information, but the answer choices A: \"city centre\", B: \"lottery ticket\", and C: \"maps\" are all things that can be found in the right location. A city centre often has a lot of things that could be useful, but the question seeks a choice that could be found somewhere not at the city center.\n\n2. The question seeks information that can be helpful. If you need to find a map to help locate the bus station, it is probably wise to look for the bus station itself first rather than just a map of the city in general. Likewise, being busy city would most likely mean that the street(s) around the bus station are also more likely going to be busy.\n\n3. Choice E: \"busy street\" would be helpful to have because it lets you know where not to go if you don't want to get caught in a busy intersection or be part of an accident. While busy street could be helpful, the question asks about what you can find at the bus station.\n\n4. Choice D: \u201cstreet\u201d is not exclusive to bus station so doesn\u2019t really make the list as a useful choice. Even if you did find street by following another of the options, that still wouldn\u2019t make \u2018busy street\u2019 a good selection, as you could still get into an accident even with a \u201cbusy street\u201d.\n\n5. Choice B: \u201clottery ticket\u201d would not be helpful at a bus station because bus stations don't typically sell lottery tickets. That would be more likely to be able to find at a grocery store.\n\n6. Choice C: \u201cmap\u201d provides useful information for finding a bus station, or any other point of interest for that matter. Additionally, the type of map would be helpful in noticing and avoiding busy streets.\n\n7. Choice A: \u201ccity center\u201d also could be on the bus station but most likely not on the bus station itself. Being able to find \u201ccity center,\u201d would require locating bus station using the map which would increase travel time and may be inefficient.\n\n8.

If the owner was the murderer and gave the gun to the police for safekeeping,  it would not have been a crime scene. Therefore these options can be discarded.\n\nOption D has \"crime\" in it and would not be descriptive of a place where a gun is. However, crime is also a type of scene such as a house scene with a murder. It is not unheard of for police departments to be tasked with gathering evidence from a different scene and then processing it from their facilities. Therefore, we can rule out Option D.\n\nOption E contains the word \"holster\" which implies some form of weaponry, either revolver or shotgun etc. It is unlikely to be used to describe a crime scene, since police often do crime scene investigations with crime guns or guns owned by the victim.

The choices are \"A: learn more about, B: headache, C: math, D: enlightened\" and E: better understanding.\n\nWe discard the answer C:'math' as'math' appears in the laboratory results. We discard the answer B: \"headache\" because headaches are not reasons for analyzing laboratory results, and we can't use those results to diagnose our own headache. We discard the choice A: 'learning more about' because laboratory results don't give us the opportunity for information gathering like learning more about a topic. In conclusion, the option D: \"enlightened\" is the best answer.

The assumption in the question is that the person will gain weight which then suggests option D does not make sense since the person is gaining weight, option D is already answered.\n2. Option B: Exercise (exercise burns calories) contradicts the assumption of weight gain.\n3. Option A: sleeping (sleeping increases weight) is not the reason to gain weight.

Considering the options, only B: to visit a Friend reflects the reasons or intention for the person to be at the location.\n3.

Option C: calculated can mean being meticulous in a manner that is not foolish, however, it could also mean being calculating and this latter possible meaning isn't the kind of attribute that would indicate wise decision making as we see in option D.\n6.

{"text": "C: pacific ocean\n\n### Input\nWhere may I best learn how to speak Spanish, the languages most used in the country of Ecuador? Choices:  C: spanish courses D: spanish community center E: spanish school F: spanish institute\nRationales: There are a number of Spanish schools and courses that anyone can take part in. Some are located in centralized locations while others are scattered around the city in various districts/areas. To increase your chances of finding suitable options, it's wise to take a look at the multiple resources available to you. These could be:\n- Spanish courses - classes held in dedicated school locations or learning centers\n- Spanish communities - often meet on a weekly or monthly basis through a community center\n- Spanish schools - have separate divisions for enlisted students who are at different skill levels\n- Spanish institutes - offer comprehensive courses where students of any skill level can enter and improve upon the knowledge of the language\nOptions A and D aren\u2019t great locations to help you find a Spanish institute or class. C would provide you with a list of options that you can enroll in, but there are other options that might fit better as well. \nOptions E and F suggest Spanish language classes but are limited to one particular kind of venue or school. There should be many options to choose from so this might not work for you.\nThe best option for learning Spanish is going to be to check different places. You could start by looking through your options to decide if you want to be in a school with different skill levels, a community center where people come together at a regular time and place, a dedicated learning center, or a course with a more formal/studious nature to it.\n\n### Inputs\nThe scientist wanted to ensure that a certain organism was safe to eat, and so he tested it.

Choices: \nA: Defective DNA strands \nB: DNA transpiration\nC: G-clamp \nD: DNA transcription \nE: Inactive Gene \nRationales: A: Defective DNA: This term refers to a DNA that has deviated to the extreme to the point where the cell does not function. Therefore, the answer is B: Defective DNA mutation.\n\nB; DNA-Transpiration: This term refers to act of transferring DNA into a different organism, not to any change in the DNA itself. This process is known as transferring DNA is different organism.\n\nC; G-clamp: A G-Clamp is a structure of DNA that was discovered in 1997. It cannot be said to be the definition of a gene mutation as G-clamp is not a mutation.\n\nD; DNA Transcription:DNA Transcription is the process that helps to produce new RNA in the organism. As such, mutation of this gene cannot be said to occur if the DNA itself changes\n\nE; Inactive Gene: In order to activate any gene, it needs to be expressed in any organism. Inactive gene is any gene that hasn't been expressed in any organism or has been turned off. As such, it cannot be said to be any type of gene mutation.\n\nAs such, DNA mutation is one of the choice that best answers the question.\n\nInput:  According to the passage, where does the government pay off the debts?

Choices:  A. set B: group C: set D: circle E: circle\nThe answer is letter A (a set in mathematics). \n\n### Explanation:\nEach of the six letters in the alphabet are unique and distinct in themselves, however, they also form the entire English alphabet when they are put together as a group. When a group of 26 letters is formed, they are then said to be a set of characters.\n\n### Examples:\nA: 1 + 2 = 3\nB: The cat is not brown\nC: The sum of three numbers is eight.\nD: She likes mathematics\nE: Eight children are in one class\n\n(See how letter A is the only math term in the examples)\n\n### Solution:\nEach of the letters in the alphabet make up a group, a set in simple terms. Each time the letters A,B, C,D and E form a group or a set, they are called different names. They represent a unique group each time, thus making them a set.\n\n### Input\nThere are only two numbers, so it follows that they must be the same. Is this statement true or false?

While \"Do Something\" clearly doesn't relate enough to change the experiment, \"Do Everyting\" may or may not refer to any aspect of the experiment, or lab in general, which makes it an ambiguous answer.

{"text": "This question is asking where multiple rulers could possibly belong, and it is a question for which one has the option to use multiple sentences (1) and (2) if the multiple rulers belong in different places (3).\n\nBecause rulers are used to measure distance on paper, they can be easily found in office supply drawers. However, these rulers might not be owned by different people. Thus, the answer to the multiple choice question in this scenario is that the rulers could be owned by different people and found in the desks/desks in different places (3), (4), (5), and (6), (7), or (8).\n\nAnswer: The answer is B: england.\n\n### Discussion:\nAs it turned out, the answer to this question was not C, but instead it was B: england. This is because the first line is incorrect. There are no \u201cother multiple choices\u201d on the answer sheet. A single \u201cother multiple choice\u201d is mentioned. While it is possible for this scenario to have two \u201cother multiple choice\u201d answers or three or more \u201cother multiple choices\u201d, that is not the case.\n\nThe first line, as is shown above, could be rewritten as \u201cIn a multiple choice question that has multiple possible correct answers, which other multiple choice may also be correct?\u201d or \u201cDo all of the possible choices matter to the correctness of my response?\u201d\n\nThe second line, as is shown below, makes the assumption that there are many possibilities that are equally valid and equal to one another, and therefore it lists all possible choices as options that could be the correct answer. This does not make sense in the context because the first sentence suggests that there is a single solution that is one of the multiple choices, and none of the other possible choices are valid.\n\nB: england \n### Response:\nThis question is more of a response option than a choice option because it suggests that the multiple choices that are possible might be on the answer sheet and might need to be considered more than one word or phrase.\n\nThe sentence that provides the answer to the multiple choices can be rewritten to \u201cDo all possible choices matter to how well I respond to the question?\u201d.\n\nThe options that are necessary in order to determine whether or not all possible answers to a question matter are C: office, D: drawer, and E: desk.", "answer": "C: office"}

Choices:  A (A) B (B) C (C) D (D) E (E)\nRanieres:\n1. The questions asks us to determine a term we could use to refer to someone's inbox.\n2. When looking at the different possible choices, A(A) & B(B) seem like they refer to something that is actually an email or attachment sent to the person in question and are therefore a bit too specific.\n3. C (C) looks like it could refer to inbox. It does not seem to refer to an email sent to them but rather the collection of communications and attachments received in an inbox. However, just looking at the word C (inbox) doesn't immediately give us a clear indication of meaning, this could be considered a \"false positive\" in that it makes us feel like we have the \"correct\" option when we really haven't understood it completely.\n4. Similarly D (D) looks like it could be either an email or an inbox. It does feel like this is what is intended by the question creator. However, it also doesn't immediately say \"I'm an inbox\" and leaves open the possibility that it is referring to an example of an email which in fact may not be what the question creator means.\n5. Finally E (E) only makes sense as a possible answer given context for the question. E (inbox) describes the term we're trying to find. It is a synonym to C (C), but it doesn't immediately say it as a possible response, only through contextualization.\n6. Therefore, after considering the pros and cons we find that E (inbox) is the true answer.\nAnswer: E (inbox)\n\n---\n\n### Note: The answer was a bit confusing because it seemed as though the answer was an email rather than an inbox. We assumed that one might have a lot of emails in their inbox but that emails are not referred to as an inbox. In our answer we referenced how C also could be an inbox.

{"text": "**\nAnswer: A: nice feeling\n\n1. If a person is forgiving, the implication is that they have forgiven others.\n2. In my life, this would result in more harmony with other people and thus would likely result in a more positive personal experience, perhaps resulting in nicer feelings.\n3. The other options listed, B: good karma, C: respect, D: new freedom and E: good heart do not necessarily result from being forgiving or indicate the force behind forgiveness. For example, a person who is respected may still have to deal with bad heart feelings from some situations.\n4. Good karma: An example of karma could be doing something good for someone because you've decided to or simply because you're a good person. However, good karma does not always result from this, so this option is disregarded.\n5. \"New freedom\" could also be derived from forgiveness if one person has forgiven another but it's up to both parties as to whether or not this results directly in the new freedom. If one person does not forgive, it may cause anger or other negative feelings and therefore, the new freedom is limited to just one person.\n6. It's also important to note that while good heart is a positive feeling or outlook on life, it is not necessarily inherent to forgiveness. For example a good heart could be reflected in an individual's generosity and forgiveness could also be reflected in this.\n7. However, forgiveness does not necessarily result from generosity so this option is also discarded.\n8. Therefore, the only option which is directly related to forgiveness and is not already included is A: a nice feeling.\n9. Therefore, the answer is A: a nice feelings.\n10. However, note that this isn't the only positive force or feeling that could result from forgiveness nor is it necessarily an inherent outcome. For example, generosity and good karma (if it's not simply generosity) could also be results from forgiveness but these have already been considered. Also, a negative feeling could result from being forgiving. For example, one might develop guilt if they forgive too easily, thus negating the nice feeling aspect.\n11.

How the game of football/basketball is played in terms of offense and defense:<n>Examples: 1. Passing (receiving or throwing) 2. Defense is when they have more yards for total yards for that quarter or game. 3. On offense, the quarterback has a short field to throw from. 4. On defense, they can block the run. 5. The defenders have to rush on 3rd downs and then give ground to the receivers and the runners. 6. Defense is when two people tackle the other to make something happen. 7. Defense is when the team is running. 8. Defense is when a player throws a quick pass and then runs down the field to run for more yards.<n><n>### Example response<n><n>- Offense is when they are throwing, passing or kicking the ball to one another. It is also when the ball is in the hands of an offensive player and is moving toward the opponent's end zone. <n><n>- Defense is when they are not throwing or passing to an opponent. It is when they are taking the ball from the receivers. <n><n>- In offense, it gives you more points in the end. In defense, it gives you an advantage of keeping the opponent out of the end zone.<n><n>### Exercises<n><n>- List any information that is not clearly stated in the instructions like "they are defending" or "it is not throwing"<n>- List any information missing from the instructions, such as "the quarterback has two touchdowns for the season"<n>- Write out some possible phrasing to better reflect what the instructions say regarding offense and defense<n><n>### Sample<n>Exercise 1<n><n>- Example:  - they rush to get their yards<n><n>Exercise 2<n><n>- Example: They're rushing to get there yards.<n><n>Exercise3

Choices:  A: apartment B: table C: school D: office E: house<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Putting a computer on the floor is an unstable position. There are alternatives that will make it more functional, including a desk, table, or at home. It would be better to buy a computer if one is having trouble finding a more stable place to keep it. The best alternative would be a desk, even if a desk is out of the budget range. There are other alternatives such as a table, school, and office, but the desk will make use of the computer more. In conclusion, having a desk for the computer rather than other alternatives such as a floor will result in more efficiency with fewer disturbances.<n>

Choices:  A: problems B: offspring C: overpopulation D: larger family E: baby<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: C: overpopulation<n><n>### Input<n><n>"Most of us have experienced the effects of a drought when we notice our plants suddenly brown, wither, and perish. We may have taken steps to alleviate the problem by rationing out our water use, for example, by turning off sprinkler systems or using only hand watering cans. If we have a well at home, we can pump until the well runs dry.<n><n>"But our plants' problems may not be as simple as lack of water, and even in a drought, many of us are unaware how much we water our plants. For a plant to absorb water, it must be both soaked up through the roots and at the same time exposed to air. Too much or too little water at any one point in time can be fatal for the plant's life.<n><n>"Plant leaves are especially sensitive to too much or too little water. Lack of water can result in a wilting plant when the soil becomes too dry. The solution to excessive drying of the plant is often just as simple as getting into the habit of providing enough water. Most plants can survive the loss of their leaves. The old leaves are often shed before the new buds emerge from their hidden position in the plant stems.<n><n>"On the other hand, for some plants such as cacti, having too much water means rotting of the plant and can be a fatal mistake. Watering too many succulent trees, for example, can cause a rotting of the tree. The plant is too sensitive to water, and its natural desert conditions are not fulfilled when too much water seeps into the plant. The result can be disastrous, killing many plants in a very short period of time.<n><n>"It is not just a question of a plant's natural environment but also of the way we perceive a plant and the way that we feel we should water it.

I think that all of these can definitely take care of themselves and help each other in your family's time of need. I have found that a great way to teach children about the importance of taking care of their home, is to give children an allowance. This can be in the form of tokens or pocket money. With this allowance, you can give your children the responsibility of choosing the amount and frequency of payment for homework or chores. There is no need for arguments about money, because they have already made a choice. When children and teenagers are aware that they are responsible for making the decision, it's easier for you to take a backseat and let them learn how to handle money.<n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>### Input:What has a master of their craft done about that craft? Choices:  A: drill B: committed murder most vile C: bargemaster D: learn E: understand<n><n>### Response:		<n>While drilling is a common task and could be done by someone without the master of their craft, it is not a task that should be done by someone without understanding that task.  However, someone without a master of their craft but who has committted murder most vile is guilty of their crimes. A bargemaster may have a master of the craft, but has likely failed the first task of a Master because a murder of their bargemaster would certainly be committed most vile.<n><n>### Review:<n>The question about where to find some plumbing was asking about finding something that would not be of any use if you were in need of water.  Bargemaster and Master are not part of the context for finding plumbing and only a commitment of murder most vile would be a crime for a murder of their borgeimaster, as opposed to murder most vile.

Choices:  A: cupboard B: chocolate C: coffee D: candy bar E: soda pop<n><n>### Response:		A: cupboard<n>### Explanation: In the sentence "There is a lot of water in what fits in your hand?," if you replace "what fits in your hand" with "your hand" you will not use the word water anymore. Using the same logic, if you replace "what food that fits in your hands?" With "the food that fits in your palm", you will not come across the word "sugar" again. This is because "sugar" is a word describing water, and since you are not looking for anything described by water, the food is safe.<n>

Choices:  A: interesting B: fun C: joyful or painful D: very important E: free<n><n>### Response:		<n>Learning is a journey. It can't be enjoyable to everyone who takes it. Often someone who is at a different stage of learning needs a different type of learning environment. It is inevitable that someone isn't going to be happy when their learning doesn't meet their expectation. At the very least, someone who doesn't like learning will be happy. How much they want to learn is directly linked to how much they enjoy learning in general. If that's the case, they won't learn anything if they want to. As a teacher, you'd have to design a system that's tailored specifically for students who don't like learning.

Choices:  A: movie B: cape kennedy C: space center D: military installation E: spaceship centre<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>In a launch pad a spacecraft or a rocket is launched into space to explore or to transport people or material to space.  <n><n>The space shuttle program (SSP) is the United States (US) space agency (NASA) project responsible for the development and operation of the space shuttle orbiter, which are flying multipurpose vehicles. The SSP was established in 1972 by US president Richard Nixon and is operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The program has been very successful and has made 61 shuttle flights and launched 286 payloads. The main goal of the SSP is to provide routine, reliable, and cost-efficient transportation for satellites and astronauts to and from the space shuttle.  <n><n>The Space Shuttle orbiter consists of a cabin with the crew, the main engines, a solid rocket booster, an external fuel tank, and a nose-mounted payload bay full of equipment. The external tank of the space shuttles supplied all the propellant. Two solid-fuel rockets on each side of the main engines were used for the launches. <n><n>The space shots of the external tank could be deorbited by ejecting the solid rocket boosters after 90 to 116 seconds into the flight. After about 5 minutes of flight, the space shuttle is set off from the external tank, which will be discharged back into the main engine. The space shuttle is then set on a 185 kilometer orbit around the earth. The solid rocket boosters are then re-ignited and dropped from the space shuttles after approximately 2 minutes and 15 seconds into the flight.<n><n>After the launch, the shuttle is now set on an orbit around the earth, and after 84 minutes, the four main engines on the space shuttle will be re-ignited. The main engine is re-engaged to fly the space shuttle back to earth in a flight of 4+ minutes. Then the boosters are then released. After all the activities during the launch, the space shuttles would have flown a distance of about 11 million miles. <n><n>The return flights of the space shuttes are known as the reentry

There are many people that I have come to find out who are always in a bad mood. I don’t think that they are always wrong (happy people in life aren't always right either), but the amount of things that happen in this world does lead to one being upset. Apathetic means not able to feel emotions like anger, sadness, joy, and the like. This is a dangerous condition that many people live with. If a person is truly devoid of emotion, there is a chance that their actions will not be very rational or logical. Many things could lead to apathy, notably an accident, abuse, and a mental condition.<n><n>### Input-A: Why might a person go to a gym? Choices: ✓ A: to exercise<n>✓ B: for exercise<n>✓ C: exercise<n>✓ D: to work out<n>✓ E: sweat<n><n>### Response A: I believe that there are multiple reasons for someone to visit a gym. If it is solely for the purpose of working out and exercising, I believe that this would come under the category of exercise. It doesn't necessarily specify whether it is indoor or outdoor exercise, but as a result, it does require that it involves intense physical activity. If someone does all of that with the goal of simply shedding some pounds, working with weights, cardio, or resistance training may be good, but they will eventually reach a point of no return. There is something special about an organized gym that would cater to many who are looking to shed some weight, tone up, become more active, or simply work on their health. It is not merely exercise; it is a workout plan or program that can be set to fit all kinds of people. Some gyms

Use the same heading you used in your instructions. You may use the same response format as in the question.**<n><n><n>### Question: What is the purpose of the DSRC?<n>DSRC stands for the dedicated short range communications.The primary communication mechanism is a radio spectrum using 5.9 GHz spectrum. This means it can operate on the same spectrum as the Wi-Fi, but its capacity is far greater than Wi-Fi. When Wi-Fi is operating within the 2.4 GHz spectrum and the 5.9 GHZ spectrum is open, the DSRC has no conflict and can communicate without interference from Wi-Fi devices. Its maximum data transfer speed is 6 to 15 Mbps.<n><n><n>The purpose of the DSCC is to enable direct communication between vehicles. As a wireless technology, this allows a communication channel to be shared at highway speeds between vehicles, eliminating the need for a human to make a call during a traffic stop. The DSCC can facilitate V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) communication, V2I (vehicle-tothings, such as infrastructure, or roadside units) communication, V2D (vehicle-todistiller) communication, and V2P (vehicle-toloudpeaker) communication, as well as applications on any of those. All these communication applications are used for vehicle-to-vehicles communications.<n><n>**Note :** Make sure you format your response properly and include a title of your response.

I would prefer a shorter function name if it is more clear, instead of the three-word title:<n><n>```js<n>const findNearestNPeopleWhoAreDoingJumpingJacks = (array, person, jumpingJacks) => {<n>```<n><n>This function looks good, there are multiple ways to do array look up but this one seems to be the fastest. When you have arrays like this, it's usually safe and faster to build a "hashcode" of each element to be able to easily index the array. Otherwise, you will iterate over the entire array for every comparison:<n><n>```js <n>const findNearestsWhoDoJumpingJacksWithHash = (array, person) => {<n>    let hash = 0;<n>    for (let i = 0 ; i < array.length ; i++) {<n>        let currentHash = array[i].person;<n>        let otherHash = array[i+1].person;<n>        hash ^= otherHash[0];<n>        if (hash === currentHash[0]) {<n>            return false;<n>        }<n>    }<n>    return true<n>}<n>```<n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>### Input:Where could you put a dollar that would make it hard to get out without breaking? Choices:  A: cash drawer B: piggy bank C: purse D: box E: pocket<n><n>### Response:		A: cash drawer<n><n>### Input :If a 24 hour fitness center had 200 members, what is the probability that at least one member would work out there?<n><n>### Response :0.9997<n><n>### Input 1: You need to get on a plane as soon as possible to take a business trip. The plane from your city of origin takes about 6 hours, and leaves every day at 6AM. When you look at tickets, you find one that gives you the most free bags of peanuts. Another flight would be a different brand of airline that flies at 6:30AM and the fares are the same (and have the same number of bags of peanut provided), but this airline charges more fees. Explain why you might prefer the 6:30 flight even though it costs more and has less baggage. Answer: If the 6:35 AM flight doesn't delay and lands 30 minutes early, there might be other delays. However, this is an unusual situation. If the 6:59 AM flight is delayed, there is a 100% chance it will get delayed, but if the flight is actually on time, it may land early. There is also a 5% chance that it will land extremely early. While 100% is much larger than 5%, it is actually much less likely that your flight will land extremely early than it would be landing on time. The other flight has a guarantee that it will land on time (provided there won't be another delay), which makes it easier to take advantage of that 30 minute early arrival if it does end up happening.<n><n>If, on the other hand, the extra 7:41am flight had a 90% chance of arriving on time, it would be the better choice because it pays off to wait 40 minutes for the earlier arrival than for the later one. But if it pays off to wait for the later arrival, you should always take the earlier flight because the additional 29 minutes of waiting isn't worth the 40 minutes of payoffs.

Consider the following case. A manager at a large shipping company has made it a priority to reduce the amount of work overtime employees are required to perform. However, it continues to be a priority for employees to ensure that the orders they fill are done to the standards of the department. As a result, many employees struggle to meet the demands set by the departmental requirements leaving them often working overtime. The best solution is to communicate the needs and requirements to employees up front and encourage them to stay within these boundaries. <n><n>The company’s employees can do their job to the best of their abilities with the requirements in mind when working for a manager who truly cares about them as a person but also as an employee. In this case, it is a priority to ensure employees meet the standard but at what cost? The impact on the employees is a negative one. To solve this issue, it will be necessary to have these conversations with employees so people can understand why and how a new procedure or policy will impact the everyday lives of its employees.

It was no different than the heavens, to man or beast. There was so much more to the sea than the waters that soaked it's land and flooded its beaches. There was all that lay in between the waters' shores that made it so vast and far reaching in its importance to man. The sea is a very mysterious part of the land that people may live around for many generations and still not know everything about it.<n><n>### Input 102-b:<n>When we were on our last adventure around the sea, my brother and I made a point every evening to sit down in a rocking chair on the dock and write down the names of all the interesting wildlife we saw throughout the day. When we compared those lists together, we found, through our very own eyes, that there were not a whole lot of new things to see under the waters of the sea.<n><n>### Response 102-c:<n>It does not seem reasonable that something so beautifully rich and full would have such limited creatures in their depths. Just one species of whale would be sufficient to keep a researcher busy for years on end. It seems like the most logical answer would be to compare the sea life to the wildlife on land.<n><n><br><n><n>### Input / Response 102 c:<n>If I have a bubble in my tea that won't pop, what part of the equation is holding it to me? Please select an answer, if an answer or any answer is required.<n><n>### Answer / Response 101 d:<n><n>The temperature is a crucial factor in the equation. The temperature of the water you are holding the tea in determines the elasticity of the bubble in the water. This then determines the air pressure that it will require to push out that bubble. <n><n><br> <n><n>## Instruction:<n><n>```<n>Below

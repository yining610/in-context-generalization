Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question asks where you would find some plumbing that would not be useful in relieving your thirst.<n>2. This means we're looking for a place where plumbing exists, but it doesn't carry potable water.<n>3. Analyzing the options:<n>   - Oil refineries (Option A) use extensive plumbing, but it's for transporting oil, not water.<n>   - The Wall (Option B) might have plumbing inside it for water transportation, which you could possibly use if you were thirsty.<n>   - The Show (Option C) could refer to a variety of things, including shows with plumbing displays. But these would probably have potable water.<n>   - Own home (Option D) would assuredly have useful plumbing for drinking water.<n>   - Water fountain (Option E) definitely would have plumbing carrying potable water.<n>4. Hence, the answer is the oil refineries (Option A) as there wouldn't be drinkable water there.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>### Input:Sammy wanted to go to where the people were.  Where might he go? Choices:  A: race track B: populated areas C: the desert D: apartment E: roadblock<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationale: 1. The person is a dog (Sammy). Since dogs love people and are curious, the character would surely want to be with people.<n><n>### 2. This suggests that the character would be looking for a populated area.<n><n>### Analyzing the options<n>   - Racetrack (Option A) does sound populated, but there wouldn't be a place to go in the crowd to drink water, for example; it's not a place where someone would normally associate with getting water.<n>   - Desert (Option C) is probably where the character wouldn't find water.<n>   - Apartment (Option E) is probably not what we're thinking about. It probably would feature water if there were humans present, but we don't know how the character would have access to it.<n>   - Roadblock (Option E) is not the answer. That'll get us stopped.<n>   - Popularized Areas (Option B) are almost certainly going to feature water for people, but Sammy needs to drink, so he would need to go to a place where his own kind can obtain water.<n><n>### Hence, the answer would be populated areas (Option B).<n>Answer: B:populated areas<n><n>### Instructions:Complete the sentence using appropriate grammar and structure.<n><n>### Sentence<n><n>Miranda ___________________ for the phone after that.<n><n>### Response<n><n>### The answer could be "ran for the phone after that."<n>### Another acceptable answer could be, "ran for the phone"<n><n>### Rationales: 1) The sentence refers to someone running after the phone.<n>2) Thus, the answer refers to action and is also correct grammar.<n>3) Miranda (the subject) is ran (run) to the phone.<n>4) Thus, the answer is a run for the phone after that (the end of the sentence)

Choices:  A: gain weight B: late for work C: heartburn D: bad breath E: early for work<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>He was eating lunch from a clock, and a cuckoo appeared.  The man rushed to the door and said "Cuckoo!" as fast as possible. And the response said "The cuckoo was actually an hour late, and a minute afterward, a cuckoo appeared."<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>Input: Why would a man rush to a cuckoo clock if he's late for work. Choices:  A. gain weight B. late for work C. heartburn D. bad breath E. early for work<n>Rationales: We need to think about what the man is eating for lunch. If he's eating a clock, then he would see a cuckoo clock. This rushed behavior is caused by the cuckoo clock. Letters are the units of time. So C = hour, M = minute. If the clock is an hour later, then there would be a cuckoo a minute later. That is why he would say "Cuckoo" but in response the response would say there was only one cuckoo.<n><n><n><n>### Response<n><n>> Answer: A: heartburn<n><n>### Output<n><n>> Question: Why did the rushed man shout 'cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckood?'

Choices:  A: alabama B: tennessee C: violin case D: music store E: bow and strings<n><n>### Response:		<n>South of Kentucky and North of Alabama will you find a fiddle being played?<n><n>### Rationales<n>The word "fiddle" is a generic term for stringed musical instruments, including violins, and the question asks us to find a state south of Kentucky where people might be playing those.<n><n>1. Alabama is south of Kentucky, though there are probably more viola players than violinists in Alabama.<n>2. Tennessee has both viola players and violin players, so there could be people playing an instrument there.<n>3. The violin case (Option C) is where you would keep a violin. But people don't play instruments in cases.<n>4. Some folks would call "music stores" (Option D) a music store, though technically that's a bit redundant. But they're often places where you go to purchase an instrument.<n>5. A bow and strings (Option E) would be the physical thing that's actually used to play the violin.<n>6.

Choices:  A: desire B: money C: time D: credit E: spending money<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The answer to the question is A (Desire). The word "she" indicates that it is a person being talked about. It also indicates that the conversation is happening in the form of a dialogue. Hence, we can start on the fact that the word "desire" is an action verb, indicating that the person talked about has a strong desire. The question gives two alternatives - "desire" and "time". Choice B is incorrect, as it is a noun, not a verb (which the question states). Anything can be driven by desire, as driving is an action. The word "money" as an alternate shows as an action to "desire", which is incorrect. The word "time" does not match the word "desire", as the question gives an alternative to it. Also there isn't any reference to "money" in between. So the question implies that time is the only alternative word as the conversation takes place in first person, which is "I". The person talks about their love of shopping products, shopping being an action, while she loved buying the products. This further implies that "shopping is the only thing the person cares about. This person does not need any logical reasons to shop. It is their obsession, which is not something that a person does just to satisfy monetary motives. Hence, the correct alternative is that she is driven by the desire to shop.<n>

Now there are X apples."  What is this an example of? Choices:  A: park B: coloring book C: garden center D: math problem E: gravity<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### Choice 'A'--Park:<n>If we assume the phrase "parking lot" is actually referring to a "park," the first sentence could be talking about the amount of space that is needed to park ten apples on a tree.<n>For example, consider the following sentence:<n><n>"There are 5 parking spots in this parking lot. Five people go fishing and park their cars in this lot. Now there are X spots in the parking lot."<n><n>#### Choice 'B'--Coloring Book:<n>If we assume this is referring to a traditional coloring book that has ten apples drawn on the left of the page. The first sentence could be asking how many apples would be on the tree to start with (10 apples) and the second sentence could be referring to how many apples we would have leftover after three apples inexplicably fell off the page, leaving 7 apples.<n><n>#### Choice  'C':Garden Center:<n>If this is referring to an actual garden center, we don't have enough information to answer the question. However, it's possible the sentence could be asking about the number of apples that the consumer could bring home from a Garden Center in which it has 10 apples.<n><n>Even if the question was asking about how many apples remain on a tree after the buyer removes three apples, we don't know how many the buyer left on the tree. However, if the buyer did leave two apples, then after they leave three, the buyer is left with one. This means that we have 7 apples. <n><n>#### Choice D:Math Problem:<n>This choice could mean that the first sentence is the initial conditions to set up a math problem and the second sentence is the steps for solving this problem. For example, we could have the following problem:<n><n>```<n>x+y=4 <n>y+z=x<n>```<n><n>The first sentence indicates that we have three variables while the second sentence indicates we have to replace some values with others. If x=2, y=3, and z=4, then we can determine that x=2, y+z=x=4 (y+4), and y+z=4 (y+z=3), which is satisfied by our initial conditions. <n><n>####

If Cassandra says, "Anything will do unless it's a vegetarian meal," this means she is willing to eat anything except a vegetarian meal (options C and E).<n>   - If Cassandra answers "Fine.  I'll eat the salad," then this means she's fine with eating meat (option B) and is not a vegetarian (option D).  This would be Cassandra's answer if she chooses to be honest.<n>2. If Cassandra says anything (options A to D), she is implying she's vegetarian (option D) because she's complaining about not being able to eat meat (option D).<n>

Choices:  A: sights B: optical illusion C: optical telescope D: light microscope E: binocular<n><n>### Response:		 A: sight<n><n>### Explanation:<n>The question asks you to give a name that starts with s that when combined in the form of a single word describes the act of viewing things and objects through something, which in this question is a telescope.<n>1. Sight - this is an everyday word used to describe our eyesight, which is something everybody has. It is also the noun form of the verb "to see" which in this context refers to how you look through the telescope.<n><n>2. Binocular - It would be a bit of a stretch to combine these two nouns; while "to look through a telescope" might be better described as "binoculars", binoculars is not better defined as a "telescope".<n><n>3. Light microscope - similar to "optical microscope", this would be acceptable if the question referred to a microscope, but in this case it is not referring to a microscope.<n><n>4. Optical telescope - This is the best noun that comes to mind. Optical is an adjective that is synonymous with "sight", as it refers to what our eyes do - which is see. Furthermore, telescope is a noun which describes an instrument that helps one sight objects from a distance. Hence, "optical telescope" is the best answer.<n><n><n>### Input : Find where the plastic ball fell among these choices. Choices:  A. Water B. Cans C. Recycling D. Yard waste E.

I told her that it was okay, which I assumed would have put her at ease, but from talking to my mom, I knew that she didn't believe me. My best friend was in town and wanted to go out for steak. To my surprise he had the same phone I had, which was odd, as I remembered that my phone was still in my room charging, because I never remembered to turn it off. I went back and turned it off and everything was fine.

When wood is carved, it also allows you to view your reflection on it as it would reflect some light from your body, similar to how polishing does.<n>4. When wood is dumped into a compost pile, it usually gets rotated or otherwise moved around. This action would create shadows that are similar to the reflections of light that the wood will show.<n>5. When a hardwood is nailed to another surface, it allows you to see your reflection in it, as well.<n>6.

Water comes up from the ground through a pipe and enters the house.<n>```<n><n>When we talk or hear about plumbing, what is it that we actually mean?  There must be some key components to plumbing that we should be aware of.  Plumbing is made of 3 components, valves, pipes and fittings.   Valves operate the flow of water to stop or start a supply.   The 3 main valves are ball/globe, butterfly and gate.   Pipes are used to transport water from source to faucets or appliance.  They are made of copper, steel or PVC.   Fitting is used to secure the pipes together such as elbows, tees, and couplers.  The elbow helps move the water in many directions.<n><n>In all, 3 things make plumbing work:  Water in, Valves, Pipes and Out.  If you think about water in 3 parts, in, at and out you immediately notice that water can do so many things.  And so if you want to be prepared you have to think about water in, valves and out.  <n><n>### Instrument-Response Writing<n><n>

Choices:  A: cold B: unfamiliar C: unknown D: unacquainted E: shy<n><n>### Response:		Mary might come off as unfamiliar (Option B), cold (Option A), or shy (Option E).<n><n>### Rationale: 1. The options A, B, and E all relate to Mary being unfamiliar, shy, or cold.<n>   - A describes Mary with a cold demeanor, and that means being distant or unfriendly. 2. Option D describes Mary as being unacquainted with James, which is a different feeling than being unfamiliar.<n>   - Option C could describe her in being unacquaintances, but it doesn' know the difference between 'unfamiliar' and 'unacquainted'.<n>3.

Choices:  A: jail time B: fear C: going to prison D: nothing E: feeling of guilt<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer to this is A, "jail time".<n><n>#### Reason One:<n>We need to answer "What happens when someone has been caught committing murder?"<n><n>#### Reason Two:<n>Someone who has committed a murder and been caught is not likely in prison; they are, more likely, in jail.<n><n>#### Reason Three:<n>It also doesn't make sense for one to receive "feeling of guilt" for committing a murder as the answer we are being told is to look for those who have "been caught committing a murder", which is unlikely someone who is going to suffer from the "feeling of guit", nor is it someone who has not committed a murder and has been caught.<n><n>#### Reasons Four&Five:<n>These two answers don't make sense for any of the other choices, so none of them would be a good answer.<n><n>### Input:[21,10,12]<n><n>### Instructions:What number follows 18, if 08 is considered to be the number 8?<n><n>### Demostrations:<n>### Instruktions:What is the product of the two number that follow 9, where 43 is considered the number it represents?<n><n>### Instuctions:Repeat the following sequence of numbers three more times:1,5,2,4,7,3,6,8,9<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Since 18 = 08 = 8 and 21 + 10 + 12 + 9 = 43 + 04 + 12 +06 +08 +09 = 80, it can be concluded that the next three numbers that are represented, in that case, are 80, and 81, and 82.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>### Rationle One:<n>The question asks what number follows 9 and 43 is considered "the number 43". This means that 43 would be replaced by 9 and 08 would be replaced by 43. Then, the question is what number follows 9, therefore 8 is the conclusion.<n>

Choices: 1) A: information 2) B: opinion 3) C: data 4) D: evidence 5) E: none of those<n>Rationales: Input asks for a kind of thing, so we need to know what it could be.  Input also says you're "looking for people" so we know it's a person-based thing rather than a thing-based thing.  This rules out option A.  It could also be that you "tell people" information rather than "telling" something (options B and C).  We know from the input this is a person-to-person conversation.  Hence, option D seems reasonable as it says you'd be looking for "people."  Analyzing the options gives us: information (option A) is more general and would be more appropriate for a larger group of people, and is not necessarily a person-to-conversation, so it's not what we're looking for.  People to talk about it are looking for opinion (option B), and can be either people, or conversation, so we eliminate this option since it's ambiguous.  Data (option C) is more appropriate for a larger situation, so is eliminated.  We're looking for opinions and it's people, making option E (none of those) not a possibility as well.  Evaluating all the options gives us only one possible answer.

Analyzed options:<n>   - The Frat boys is a specific group, and it's plural.<n>   - Doing what or enjoy what is generally the case, and it's singular.<n>   - Get laid has obvious sexual contexts. Therefore, it's not the answer.<n>   - There's a specific answer and there's a specific context, so it's not 'do anything'.<n>   - Having fun is contextual to 'tonight' but 'have fun living' or 'have fun working' are not specific enough for us to be certain if this is what's intended. Hence, it's not an answer.<n>   - 'Working less' is too specific, so it's clearly not the answer.<n>4. Lastly, it is either 'A', 'B', or 'Have fun'<n>5. 'Do enjoy', 'enjoyable' or 'enjoy living' does not fit into the answer choice 'A', and it doesn't match the original text. Since it has different structure and the same spelling as 'Have fun', it's the answer.<n><n>### Answer:

It was a what? Choices:  A: countryside B: anthology C: dull read D: state park E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The question asks what the show was that was about a ranger who loves flowers?<n>2. A show that is about a ranger who is passionate about flowers is certainly'science.'<n>3. As the show the next day was 'about a gardener who loves flowers' the previous day's show about a ranger also 'likes' flowers, hence, it is an 'anthology'.<n>4. Rationales for each of the answers are:<n>   A: C: <n>   - D: Countryside would not be the subject material that you would find in an 'anthology' show, hence, it's not the option.<n>   - B: <n>   - E: <n><n>### Instructions:<n>Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n>### Input: The following sentence contains five words of its kind.

E: compound word F: abbreviation<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. This sentence has five words and four of these are words of different types that are put together.<n>2. Words of this type are defined on the previous slide as 'adjective words, adverb words', 'collective noun words', 'compound words', and 'idiom words'.<n>3. As the next word in the sequence is an 'adverb' in the sentence, we can eliminate three remaining options that are not adverb words and 'abbreviations' are the option remaining!<n><n>### Input : How can you tell someone is a lawyer, or how can you detect a doctor?<n><n>### Response<n><n>### Rationals:<n>1. The questions ask how you can tell someone is a lawyer or doctor, or what you can do to detect them?<n>2. As the question is 'How can you tell someone is lawyer or a doctor?', you need to analyze what are the attributes of a 'lawyer' or a 'doctor'?<n>3.

Choices:  A: sitting down B: excitement C: tiredness D: progress E: procrastination<n><n>### Response:		<n>Let's look at the options:<n>1. Sitting down (Option A) wouldn't be a problem, since it's a prerequisite to begin work. Hence, this is ruled out.<n>2. Excitement (Option B) is more complicated. You could be either excited about work (because you love it) with or without it being difficult.<n>3. Tiredness (Option C) would be a problem, as exhaustion could make you feel unable to do any work.<n>4. Progress (Option D) would be a problem as well, because if you don't feel excited about the work you can't begin it.<n>5. Procrastination (Option E) is the opposite of excitement, so if you're excited about procrastination, then you will be able to do some kind of work.<n>Hence, based on the options, the best choice would be procrastination (Option D), because if you cannot begin, progress and excitement are ruled out.<n><n>### Question #6 Which word best describes what people can say as they walk from one room to another room? Choices:  a) Slowly b) Fastly c) Carefully d) Slyly e) Silly<n><n>### Response<n>Let's look carefully at the option:<n>1. Slowly (Option A) doesn't make much sense, because we use the adverb slow to describe things going at a slow, deliberate pace, such as one foot in front of another to walk.<n>2. Fastly (Option C) is clearly an adverb which isn't defined and doesn't match the context of the questions.<n>3. Carefully (Option E) is an adjective which does not help in this sentence.<n>4. Slyly (Option D) is also an adverb, which is defined as in a cunning or secretive way: not honestly; deceitfully.

The question asks what time of day when you're thirsty would likely be the cause of the thirst, rather than the natural course of events, which would occur when the body's water supply is low.<n>2. This implies that we should think about which time of day is when the body is low on water, which would be very early in the morning.<n>3. Analyze the following options:<n>   - 4 PM (Option B): Is too late in the day.<n>   - 4 AM (Option C): Is too early in the day.<n>4.

Choices:  A: joke B: humor C: frightened D: fight E: laughter<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: C: frightened<n><n>### Answer Explanation:<n>The question is describing a scenario in which people are happy when they experience a “surprise and unexpected” emotion, but it doesn’t say which specific emotion that would be.<n><n>Analyzing the options: Option A (a joke) doesn’t answer the question because it doesn’t state that a specific emotion is being experienced. Option B (humor) doesn’t answer because it merely explains the concept of being amused whereas the question is interested in knowing the emotion that results from it. Option C (frightened) answers the question because it describes the emotion of surprise that results from a frightening situation, which the question is asking us to identify. Option D (fight) doesn’t answer, because there isn’t any mention of people fighting as part of them being surprised. Lastly, Option E (laughter) still doesn’t answer the specific question, because an unexpected and happy response from laughter only shows that laughter can occur when it’s surprising, but doesn’t show which emotion one may feel surprised and happy about. Therefore, the answer is option C (frightened).<n><n>### Reference:<n><http://www.lumosity.com/games/happily-ever-after><n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: What was the name of the person who was the oldest winner of the Superbowl?<n>Rationales: The question asks us about the person who was the winner of the Superbowls.

Analyzing the options:<n>   - Oil refineries (Option A) use extensive plumbing, but it's for transporting oil, not water.<n>   - The Wall (Option B) might have plumbing inside it for water transportation, which you could possibly use if you were thirsty.<n>   - The Show (Option C) could refer to a variety of things, including shows with plumbing displays. But these would probably have potable water.<n>   - Own home (Option D) would assuredly have useful plumbing for drinking water.<n>   - Water fountain (Option E) definitely would have plumbing carrying potable water.<n>4.

Choices:  A: sore B: intercourse C: fatigue D: become tired E: expression<n><n>### Response:		C<n><n>The process of becoming tired or fatigued requires much energy, just like dancing does.<n><n>### Input:"Ask yourself why it is not possible for two people to walk in the same direction" Choices:  A:"The other person may see something you haven’t" B: "While you can be oblivious of one another" C: "You might both not have a common goal" D: "You may collide into one another" E:""Because you’re moving at different speeds""<n><n>### Answer: C<n><n>You and another person could walk in the same direction, but at different speeds.<n><n>### Rationales: 1."Two people walking in the same direction" was taken as the given, and thus "could" was taken as the incorrect statement.<n>2. It could be possible for two people moving in the same direction to have a common goal and to not collide at all.<n>3. "While you can both be oblivious of each other" was another choice of the riddler where the second person could be oblivious to the first's obliviousness.<n>4. "Because the other person may see something that you haven’t" was another choice which implies that you can’t both be in the same direction and be oblivious to each other.<n>5. "You may collide with one another" was another choice that implies you cannot both be in the same location moving in the same direction if you might collide with one another.<n>6. Finally, the "Because you’re both moving at different speeds" choice was taken as the given.<n>7. Thus, the given statement is "because you could be oblivious of this" since the two individuals can be oblivious.<n>8. Hence, the choice "C: You might both not have a goal" is the correct answer in this riddle.<n><n>

A better option is to bury it as this will not cause any smelling and the other options will cause smelling. So B is a better option because in B, you can bury it.<n>Now, there are also no words like television or television so it would be incorrect to say “put it on the TV” as this is an incorrect spelling error and is not an option and saying “say, “here, Fidos, it’s your poop now,” would not make any sense as well which is another reasoning for saying option C is incorrect. <n>So, the options are “Give it to the dog and bury it. <n>Answer : B.Giving it to the dog and Bury it.<n><n>### My instructions:<n><n>We are talking about a bunch of frogs sitting in a pond.<n><n>What do you want to tell me about the frogs in this pond?<n><n>What kind of questions do I ask?<n><n>How much money would it take to buy a pond full of frogs?<n><n>Which tape can hold up 300 pounds as an object?<n><n>Why does it cost more at $2.99 than $1.75?

Choices: 1: down 2: up 3: same as the first step 4: none of the above 5: the staircase is circular and has a continuous loop that doesn't need to go 6: the staircase has a continuous loop, but not every step is the same length<n><n>Rationales:<n>2. The question asks how far it is from landing at the bottom of a staircase to starting at the top, and then continues with, "if you go up a stairs backwards".<n>2.  If we go up a stair backwards, we start at the bottom, but when we land at the top, we won't be any closer to where we started than when we started at the bottom, so it means we went 0 steps back.<n>3. Analysing the other options:<n> - Option 2 is not possible because going up a stair backwards means we arrive at the top but are farther away from the bottom if we started there.<n> - Options 3 and 4 are not possible because we had to start somewhere - we cannot "have started" at a point that is farther away from where we began.<n> - Option 5 is not possible because we didn't arrive at the "top step", since we never started there in the first place.<n> - Option 6 is not possible because of the same reasoning as Option 3.<n>4. Hence the answer is Option 1: down.<n>5.<n><n>Answer:<n>Answer: 1: down<n><n>### Input<n>**If the temperature reaches 30 degrees Celsius, the heat causes what to happen?**<n><n>1.

Hence it must be that the stores profit from buying those products since the women are tricked into doing so. This means their sales are affected by the number of women who buy the products. Hence the women want to buy more products to make the store make a profit, which means they also would want to buy more, resulting in increased sales. Hence the choice that refers to buying more product is the correct one.<n>Answer: B: buying more products<n><n>### Instructions:Fill in the blanks for the following example sentence with the correct form.<n>In each example sentence, choose whether the missing word should be singular or plural.<n><n>Fill in the blank with the appropriate ________.<n>1.

Since their daughter uses more than one block to build the houses, the chosen answer is option A.<n><n>Answer: Option A.<n><n>1. My daughter enjoys building houses with blocks, while her brother enjoys building them with Legos.<n><n>I used "The word my" to distinguish the daughter from the son.  You may also use other words to distinguish them.<n><n>### Option B (Wrong):<n><n>1. My is daughter a block that enjoys building houses, while her brother is who enjoys building them with Lego?<n><n>Analysis:<n><n>This sentence is incorrect since the daughter doesn't enjoy building houses, the daughter enjoys building them with blocks, but we didn't specify that she was building houses out of blocks. While the son enjoys building Lego houses and Lego blocks. This means that this answer uses singular words and a plural word, there would be too many Lego blocks to complete the sentence and building houses wouldn't be the word to describe her since it is used to refer to the father, so this sentence is incorrect.<n><n>Answer: Wrong choice<n><n>2.

So we can rule out option C as it says to speak to people and is not to do for money<n><n>If we know we need a sentence that cannot refer to an idea or a goal then we will disregard option D which says to do for money to everywhere. To disregard an answer we need to show that there is a contradiction in it<n><n>Therefore we can rule out option D and there is only option A left which says god wants people to do for money and work in life thus option A is the best answer since god wants everyone to do work in life to earn money.<n><n>I hope this helps in understanding the format to answer the questions

(Option:B)Visit relatives: 1. The person should visit relatives. The people may be helpful in the situation.<n>2. It's hard to find out more information. We do know that it is a very likely choice.<n>3. The other answer choices:<n>   - Amount to nothing(Option A) won't help the person; it means nothing will happen.<n>   - Charming(Option C) may not be helpful. There's no guarantee it would work.<n>   - Doctor(Option E) would be helpful, but he would most likely die if he was wounded.<n>   - Cross street(Option D) is a weird answer that is probably meant to be 'Visit relatives'.

Choices:  A: large city B: seattle C: curry D: clothing E: reservation<n><n>### Response:		John might opt for a large city (Option A) along with the rest of the restaurant's selection.<n><n>### Feedback: The given sentence should indicate that John is someone to whom you're speaking, and you're at an Indian restaurant on top of the Space Needle (which is a landmark in Seattle).<n><n>### Input/Feedback:<n>What would you do if you found a small package on your desk with a note from john saying it was a small favor for helping find clothing for his mom last week. what option would you choose if you couldnt decide between two?<n><n>### Instructions:<n>### Demontrition:<n>A: take picture of the package. B: call John's mother and tell her what's happening. C: tell yourself "I guess I do need to get clothes for my mom" D: tell john that his package has been delivered E: text john. F: text john. <n>### Feedbacl:<n>#### 1. The sentence "John is a man who lives in Washington" might suggest this is about a man named John, living in Washington State. This doesn't seem likely since "A: Small package on your desk" makes it seem like the package is not on your desk.<n>#### 2. The first sentence hints that the person to whom you're referring lives in Washington.<n>#### 3. Clothing could refer to anything from an apple to a pair of shoes.<n>#### 4. The "saying it was a small favor" makes it seem like John is saying he's returned the favor.<n>#### 5. The sentence "on your desk" makes the package seem like it's in a physical location, so it can't be a text or email message. Plus, the phrase "take picture of the package" implies it's physical.<n>#### 6. "D: tell john that your package has been delivered" seems like it's in the right category for the prompt, but you can't tell John because you don't have a cell phone or an internet connection to text/email him.<n>#### 7. The text could be John returning a favor for helping you get clothes for your mom, but you can' not call John's mom. This doesn't make any sense.<n>#### 8.

B: Option B: Retrain all soldier, so that they can deal insurgency: This sounds like some sort of military training idea, which is not what is being asked.

In what place?<n><n>4. This means that we're looking for the place where a house-holder keeps their plastic toys.<n><n>5. Analyzing the choices, it can be seen that there's really a chance of finding plenty.<n><n>6. Cupboard (C) and cabinet (B) (for the US) could fit. Cupboard can mean several things, like a closet or china/dish/cutlery rack, and could refer to a place where you could find plastics. Cabinet, on the other hand, does mean more of a closet where you might shove things in, as you might do if you have unbreakable/thin plastics. However, we know that these objects can't "break" and so aren't meant to be stored in this way.<n><n>6. So, we can say that there's a chance they would be held in the own home (D), which does mean your house, but also could refer to a flat that someone shares if they have their own home there.<n><n>7. So, our options become either the own home (D) or everything (E).<n><n>8. Often, garbage dumps or dumps (E) could include plastic things, but there doesn't seem to be any guarantee of that.<n><n>9. Hence, the answer should really just be everything, as the answer is all possibilities.<n><n>### Input:"Is there a possibility of finding plastic things in your own home's garbage dump?"<n><n>Output/Input:"No, because it's unlikely there are such plastics in a garbage dump."

Getting work done (Option B) is a ceremony that takes place at the Bride, a restaurant that offers a buffet-style meal. The bride and groom probably have other tasks to take care of, so it's unlikely they will take care of proposals here.<n>2. Efficiency (Option A) - this is likely referring to a wedding planner who specializes in coordinating weddings. This company probably has many clients with many different ceremony requests, so it's not likely they would take care of the bride and grooms proposal.<n>3. Marriage (Option D) is a ceremony that celebrates the joining of two families as one. This ceremony is usually the last one that takes place before the couple leaves with their family on their honeymoon.<n><n>Hence, the answer is the finishing up ceremony (Option E).<n><n>Answer: E: results<n>

Choices:  A: pocket B: shower C: chemist D: drug store E: shaving kit<n><n>### Response:		The store where someone is likely to find razors is an interesting question. When first presented, I might imagine a shaving kit (Option E). However, it quickly becomes clear that not having shaving products nearby would be inconvenient, thus eliminating this answer. In this example, I am left with three possible answers: chemist (Option C), drug store (Option D), or the shower (Option B).<n><n>### Rationale: The shower (Option B) is more of an area where soap might be stored. I wouldn't expect the shower to have razors. I know that many people use a shower soap dispenser to hold their razor. The chemist (Option C) would be able to provide one, as would a drug store (Option D). The drug store answer would have to be the better answer then.<n>

Choices:  A: fullness B: underwear C: bad breath D: better day E: dirty dishes<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: E: dirty dishes (the sink is where the dirty dishes go post-breakfast - they're not left on the table)<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. The question asks what a large family would likely leave to clean up after eating their breakfast together.<n>2. There's a variety of things they could leave in the sink after eating their breakfast.<n>3. Analysing the options:<n>  - Fullness (Option A) is something that happens to one if they had too much food at breakfast. This wouldn't be in the sink after a meal.<n>  - Bad breath (Option B) only means you should brush your teeth after breakfast - which isn't usually done in the family setting described.<n>  - A better day (Option C) means getting excited about what may be better/more productive, not about eating breakfast.<n>  - Underwear (Option D) sounds like it could be true and may even lead to an interesting/saucy story.<n>  - The dirty dishes (Option E) is most likely what the people would leave in the sink after they'd done eating, meaning that's the answer.<n>  - An added hint is the description of the plural ("a large family"); that probably means they have multiple people. So the answer can't be B, C, or D.<n>Answer: E: Dirty dishes

Choices:  A: apartment B: table C: school D: office E: house<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: Where would you put a computer rather than a desk?<n>Answer: The question is clear-a computer instead of a desk. But the options do not indicate whether to find a specific place, and are worded in such a way that any other answer could be incorrect. The most likely answer is "Apartment" since most apartments do not have a desk, but they do have places for placing a computer. <n><n>### Analysis:<n>1. The question asks you to "put a computer rather than a table."<n>2. An individual could decide that desks are not actually "tables" (but they are), which could then make you choose the next alternative, "dining room table," where you would be "putting" a computer. That is a non-answer, however, since a computer cannot "put" itself anywhere, nor can it be "put" like an object inside an area.<n><n>3. The question states that a computer is to be placed "rather" than a desk, making the alternative desk choice redundant, a common mistake in word choice.

Choices:  A: city centre B: lottery ticket C: maps D: street E: busy city<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>|<n><n>Rationales:1. The question asks what we could find in a bus station that could help us.<n>2. It then gives six options, four of which I could see as providing some help.<n>3. Analysing the options:<n>  * Bus station (Option A) might have a map, making it potentially useful.<n>  * Buttons (Option B) may sound like a weird item to be found in a bus station, but it might refer to the buttons on the ticket machine that would help us get the ticket we need to travel.<n>  * Maps (Option C) might be available at a bus stop (although they're more likely in a tourism office).<n>  * City centre (Option D) might be a good place to visit - we might find the item we're looking for there<n>  * But busy city (Option E) can be potentially helpful - e.g. we can find the street the bus station is on, or the bus is passing close to an address we’re looking for.<n>4. Therefore, my answer is the buttons on the ticket machines (Option B).<n>Answer: B: buttons<n><n>### Input : Describe a situation in which you might find someone taking your picture?

Choices:  A: roman architecture B: whitehouse C: spreadsheet D: bridge E: pantheon<n><n>### Response:		<n>This would definitely need the use of spreadsheets.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The question asks about numbers and columns, so we need something that deals with numbers.<n>2. Analyzing the choices:<n>   - Roman architecture (Option A) is not used to format a series of data.<n>   - White House (Option B) is not used to arrange a series of columns.<n>   - Spreadsheet (Option C) provides a way to organize a spreadsheet (a set of numbers in columns).<n>   - Bridge (Option D) is only used as transportation, not for column organization.<n>   - Pantheon (Option E) is an ancient Roman building. It has columns, but it's not used for column organization.<n>3. Hence, we should use the spreadsheet since it provides a means to organize a series of columns.

I would do this even if they weren't able to speak.  They may not be able to speak, but it doesn'y mean they can't do a particular task.  So I would help them do that task.  Example, if they can't speak but need a drink of water, I might bring it to them or ask what it is they want for a drink.  If they have a drink and I suspect that my friend needs a change of clothes in their fridge or needs help with cleaning or something similar, I would go help them in that area.

Choices:  A: drawer B: back to its owner C: police station D: crime scene E: holster<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is `The investigator considered the [gun / evidence of] gun, where did he send [this / it]?`.<n><n>### Rationale: 1. The sentence says "The investigator considered the evidence of the gun,...", so that means we need to refer back to the noun "gun", not the whole sentence.<n><n>2. The options aren't grammatically correct, so you'll likely know that they can't be the right words.<n><n>3. The grammar for "where did he send [that gun / the evidence of gun]?" isn't even correct because the prepositional phrase ["the evidence of gun"] must agree with "that / it".<n><n>### Input:"The barking dog was shot at."Where was the dog at? Choices: A: by the gunman B: behind a wall C: hiding D: behind the barker E: on the porch<n><n>### Rationales:1. "The dog was shot by the gunman" is grammatically correct. "Behind a wall" makes no sense.<n><n>2. "Hide" and "hide and seek" have related etymological origins, so they should generally be used in the context of hiding and not of barking.<n><n>3. "The barker" is a term for the person who sells something and makes the sounds, but they rarely do so while barking, unless they're a dog.<n><n>4. Barkers are usually associated with markets.<n><n>5. "On the porch" is just a vague way of saying that the dog was right next to the person who shot it.<n><n>6. Hence, the answer must be "by the gunman".<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Write a response that appropriately fills in each blank.<n><n>### Ratiocinations:<n>1. The sentence said "A: __________ B: ____________ C: _________ D: _____________ E: ___________", so we know we need to use each blank with the correct answer.<n>2. No answer, just the correct form.<n>

It makes you think of what if you were to be the only survivor of a disaster and how you would live it and what your friends would do as well as yourself. there are some very interesting details to the story, one of them being, that when the boys first arrive on the island, they create a ship that has a pighead on top as their leader who they are calling "The Lord Of the Flies" because pigs are filthy creatures so it makes sense what they chose. There is little to no action going on in the book. it is more focused on characters and their interactions with each other instead of the action being about fighting some invading force.

Choices:  A: hang in closet B: sniff C: get dirty D: become soiled E: air out<n><n>### Response:		<n>You should hang the clothes in the closet (option A).<n><n>The other options should be ruled out. The clothing will have developed a smell if they can't be washing, indicating that they probably had a smell prior to develop them.<n><n>Hanging in the closet can remove smells from clothes, as they will be hung under the best airflow in this manner (option A).<n>However, the other solutions can be excluded.<n>Firstly, sniffing (option B) isn't a plausible way to remove smells, as it isn't the most efficient method of detecting whether items emit an odor.<n><n>On the other hand, the other options would not be effective at removing this smell in this case.<n>Doing so would be like adding more pollutants to clothing (getting dirty (option C)) or adding more smells to clothing (becoming soiled (option D)), so these may not be ideal options.<n><n>Airing out (option E) would also do this effectively; however, it does not remove the smell.<n><n>So, the best solution is to hang the clothing in the closet (Option A).<n>This is the best method of deodorizing this garment.<n><n>### Review:<n>When you can't wash an item, you should air it out at a well ventilated place. If this doesn't work you may want to sniff it carefully. Hanging the item in the closet (which doesn't involve sniffing) can help take more smells away.<n><n>This solution, hang in the closet, can be a viable option for other smelly items as well.<n><n>### Conclusion:<n>When clothes can't be wash, it's best to hang them in the closet and air them out to reduce the odors.

Choices:  A: brain problems B: laziness C: get fat D: headache E: laughter<n><n>### Response:		Sitting too close to the TV can result in eyestrain and headaches.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The question asks us to find a word that describes pain occurring due to sitting too close to a TV set for too long.<n>2. Analyzing the provided choices:<n>   - Laziness (Option B) has nothing to do with the symptoms of sitting too close to the TV. Eating too much unhealthy food because you're sitting too close to the television could result in weight gain, but not the type of pain the question is asking us about.<n>   - A headache (Option D) can be caused by sitting too close to the tv and experiencing eyestrain for a prolonged period of time and also by eating too much unhealty food after watching tv.<n>   - Laughing (Option E) sounds too farfetched to believe for such a condition, and also, in which case, people generally laugh out of joy and not because of pain.<n>   - These then leaves us with Brain problem (Option A) and Headache (Option D), but ultimately, headaches can be caused by sitting close to TV, even if it is brain problem.

The question describes the soccer field in terms of it being in a building and not in a building. In other words, we're not looking for any soccer field. <n>  * The playground (Option B) is not specifically mentioned, but it's possible the question is referring to one of the outdoor areas of a playground. <n>  * Mexico (Option C) is an unrelated country that has nothing to do with whether or not a soccer field is in a building or not.<n>  * Town (Option D) and outside (Option E) are not mentioned in the requirements.<n><n>Answer: Not one of the options.<n>### Input: What would not happen if you were to find a cow in an orchestra? Choices:  Choices:  A B C D E<n>### Response: None of the options above are possible for the reasons outlined.<n><n>Rationale:<n>1. The question asks what would not occur if you found a cow in the orchestra. In other words, if something did happen when finding a cow in an orhestra, it would occur.<n>2. 1. Cow in orchestra (Option A) would not happen for a variety of reasons.<n>    - If the cow was in the orchestra, someone would notice it.<n>    - There wouldn't be any room for a cow.<n>    - There would be no food for the cow, in comparison to being at a cow farm, where they would be fed.<n>3. The options above. Cow in cow farm (Option B) doesn't have to necessarily have a cow, in the sense of an individual one. That is, it would happen if there were cows in the orchestra.<n>4. A cow in Mexico (Option C) could possibly happen if the cow had been transported there. It doesn't have to pertain to whether or not the orchestra is in Mexico.<n>5. A cow in the town (Option D) could possibly happen if someone transported it to the town. The criteria that this would have to occur in a town is not clearly provided.<n>6. A cow in the outside (Option E) could happen if the cow were transported outside. There doesn't have to be orchestra involved outside, so you wouldn't know to bring one there.

Choices:  A: injury B: death C: playing uno D: coma E: falling down<n><n>### Response:		B: death<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Analysis of the Choices:  Option A: The question states sky diving, which implies that there's a plane there, although they jump out of it. This refers to the sky and the earth. Hence, they're not losing consciousness on the plane. We also know that sky diving scared him as it's a fear of his. Hence, option A is incorrect.<n>Option B: They might be losing consciousness while falling down or after hitting the ground, but either way, they don't regain consciousness since they died on the way.<n>Option D: Coma is not a correct answer as they're not conscious at all.<n>Option E: Falling down is not correct, as they're falling down to their death, so coma would be the correct answer. <n>Hence, the correct answer would be their death as they're dead.<n>Answer: B: death<n>### Input:Which of these actions would the most likely result in the death of the person performing it?

The most common argument in the literature is that the level of education for the population of these countries is simply not enough, and as such the political systems will remain unstable and under constant civil war. While this may be true in some areas, I would argue that there are also various elements of culture that provide more stability to some systems of governance. For example, in Africa there are many tribes with shared heritage across borders. The tribalism will provide the necessary political and moral support to keep the social contracts formed in the modern political systems, and make them last, even through periods of civil unrest.

Lastly, it appeared that the only direction he was running was against the flow of traffic that was leaving the corner store.<n>This is a relatively simple deduction.  Given an obvious fact, a fact of observation, a fact of deduction, and another fact of deduction (all of which I've mentioned above), it's really not difficult to come to the conclusion that one should deduce.<n><n><n>

The question asks: "What can a massive building be?", and we are to fill in this statement with an answer that fits. <n>2. Our goal is "an answer that fits", because only one option, C, "dwarfs", fits, so the answer could be option C.<n>3. Our analysis of the options is to narrow the answer down to one: we find out that dwarf (Option C) is the only option that is gramatically correct, so our answer to the first question is option C.<n>4. Input: "What could an enormous building be if it is built unwell?"<n>Choices: A: insubstantia<n>B: massless    <n>C: dwarfish    <n>D: inconsequentis    <n>E: build/to build<n>Rationale<n>1. The statement again asks "what could an enormous building" (not "what would an enormous building" or "what should an enormous building"), and we are looking for the best replacement for "enormous building".<n>2. The options narrow it down to "enormous building" which has five letters, and since only "dwarf" makes grammatical sense as an adjective for "building", the answer has to be "dwarf", as found in Option C.<n>3. The final sentence asks "What could an enormity be, if it is built poorly?", and similarly, the replacement has to be "poorly", so "what can a poorly constructed enormity be" is the same as "What could a poorly constructed building be?", and the answer found so

Choices:  A: liquidated B: own resources C: branch out D: commit crime E: game over<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: D: commit crime<n>### Demonstraion:<n>1. This company would not be able to make payments (Option A) (liquidated) or continue its normal operation as it's unable to pay for utilities or its staff salary.<n>2. So the company would have to close (Option B), sell off as much of its assets in other companies (Option C) as possible (branching out), or commit crime like embezzling some of their cash and gold (Option E) for covering their daily operation as this company has enough assets to cover this cost.<n>3. Hence, the correct answer is committing a crime, as all other options either mean a complete closure, or branching out.<n><n>### InputWhat are two things you can do only on your home computer rather then public computers?

The question asks about the reason someone is actively working.<n>2. This is because bills are a debt (an account you owe) that you need to pay.<n>3. Analysing the options, the answer has to be 'bills,' or 'pay debts.'<n>Answer: A: pay debt<n><n>### Input:/_>What is the easiest way to keep up?

Not go along (Option D)<n>   - Not go along means do the opposite of go along i.e. not go with them or not follow closely, thus keep up means to take part in an activity, to participate.<n><n>4. Not Follow closely (Option E)<n>   <n>   - Keep up (which is an activity that you can do) may refer to the progress achieved by another person, and you are told _"what",_ therefore it clearly means to keep up means to check on whether you are still following the person from whom you are following.<n>   - So, you are to check on whether the person is still going at the same speed you are or at a better speed i.e. to check the progress made on the activity.<n>5. Keep up-to-date (Option E)<n>   - Not an answer (even if it is a synonym for keeping up it is not an option),<n><n>### Answer: Go along (Option B),<n><n>**Reference

Where might he go? Choices:  A: neighbor's house B: bridge C: home D: homeless shelter E: prison<n><n>### Response:		<n>It is not a good idea for people to take alcoholic drinks especially when they are on a diet and the best choice of drink for them is plain water. This information can be sourced from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism which is an organization established by the United States Government to encourage people to avoid the use of alcohol. In the case where someone wants alcohol, then they are supposed to avoid a diet that contains alcohol with no water and they should go for plain water at the very least if they must take a drink that contains alcohol. It, therefore, follows that a place where one can easily get alcohol together with plain water is the best choice which brings us here in a homeless shelter where one can get alcohol and water at the same time. The bridge is no good since there is no water besides alcohol and there is, therefore, room for some other people to get sick when they drink water from such a place. The neighbor's house and the probation home are no very safe places for Jimmy as there are chances that he might get arrested for alcohol drinking.<n><n>### Input:(A) I'll tell you where a good place to sit in my house if you keep your mouth shut about what I'm about to do. Choices:  A) bathroom, B) back porch, C) patio D) bedroom, E) my lap<n><n>### Response:(B)<n><n>#### Demonstration: <n>The bathroom is the place that I could sit in my house while keeping my mouth shut about what I plan to do and it is away from my bedroom where my guests sleep, away from my bathroom where I pee, away from my kitchen where I play, and away from my living room where I watch TV and it is also away from my patio where I sit and eat. The bedroom is no good since guests who are invited over are not allowed in here and I wouldn't want to offend my guests by putting them in my bathroom. The back porch is also not one of my favorite places in my house because this is the place where I sit and put some of my guests when they become too noisy. My patio is also a place that I don't sit on and I'd want to keep the guests away from there too by giving them a place to sit. So

Choices:  A: football stadium B: laboratory C: baseball stadium D: pharmacy E: soccer game<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: B: laboratory<n><n>### Justification<n><n>Rationales:<n>1. Since bleachers are a raised area for viewing an event or performance from, so they are usually constructed so that the viewers can see over what is happening below.<n>2. Bleachers can be designed to seating, so an appropriate response would involve any stadium or arena where events take place.<n>3. Since the question asks for the location of the child's first game in the bleacher, the child is probably enjoying the show happening on the playing field below. So, this would be the Laboratory.<n>Answer: B: Laboratory<n><n>### Input:`Which of the two statements is more likely to be an example of a paradox?

Statement 2 is clearly a paradox because it says two contradictory things. Paradoxes have contradictory aspects.<n>2. Statement 1 in the question has one piece of contradiction, but it has a meaning and can be understood. As such, it doesn't meet the criteria to be a paradox. It's simply a sentence that expresses some paradoxical thought.<n>Answer: B : The more you know, you less you understand.<n><n>### Input : Which of the two statements is a more accurate description of the function that a program (or an algorithm) performs?

Statements 4 is an accurate description. Statements 3 and 4 are both true.<n>2. Hence, statement 4 is much simpler and better describes the function of a program.<n>3. Statements 3 is not a paradox; it is simply the question asking for a paradox.<n>Answer: 3

Choices:  A: public place B: roadblock C: space shuttle D: hoverboard E: supermarket<n><n>### Response:		In 2151, humanity began space exploration using space shuttles. It was a success. At the same time, inventors made self-balancing, self-propelling, and self-guiding hoverboards. Many people bought hoverboards because they believed that it would solve all their traveling problems.<n><n>However, in 2166, inventors made the Hovering Coffee Table. They did so by attaching a hoverboard to a coffee table. Unfortunately, this was a disaster. People soon realized that they could ride the hovering coffee table just like a hoverboard, but they thought that it would be safer than the regular hoverboards. In fact, it was not. The hovering coffee tables were unstable, as evidenced by the fact that they couldn't even hold two people at a time. In addition to this, they were also less fun due to their limited capabilities.<n><n>Furthermore, in 2189, scientists discovered that the moon did not consist of rocks, but of gasoline. They also found that the sun's light was actually a projection cast over the surface of the earth. In other words, humans were deceived when they believed that they had discovered a way to explore space.<n><n>As a result, many people turned to public bathrooms for relief from the sun. Sadly, this did not work as well as intended. The sun's rays began to burn through the bathroom walls and people could feel the heat even if they were behind closed doors. Thus, this attempt at exploring space never happened.<n><n>### Input 2189:What should you do if you find a wolf eating a sheep? Choices:  a: Call animal control  b: Call the cops<n><n>### My Solution: You should call for animal control because wolves are known for preying on sheep. Animal control can save the sheep's life by removing it from the wolf.<n><n>### Discussion: The animal control should handle the situation because wolves are known predators that eat sheep. Thus, it is important to call animal control if a sheep is in danger.<n><n>### What went wrong with your solution?<n>* Not every solution works.<n><n>### Write a step-by-step description that demonstrates this solution.<n><n>### How should I write for this

Choices:  A: orchestra B: school band C: music store D: opera house E: home<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I would go to a music store to get a bass clarinet, then I would take it home with me.<n><n>### Rationales<n><n>1. "Where would you get a base clarinet to take home?" is a multiple choice question.<n>2. You are to consider a bass clarinet as a musical instrument.<n>3. The options:<n>   - Orchestra (Option A): The orchestra would have lots of different clarinets, including a bass clarinet, but you would probably not be able to take them home.<n>   - School band (Option B): The school band would definitely have the bass clarinet, but again it would probably go home with the teacher.<n>   - Music store (Option C): The music store is where you go to buy instruments, musical books, and music supplies. So again, the bass clarinet would have to go with the store owner.<n>   - Opera house (Option D): If you're attending an opera, there probably isn't any way to take the bass clarinet home you can take home.<n>   - Owning home (Option E): If you owned a home, you would be able to play an instrument with any clarinet. But you would not be able to take home the bass clarinet you picked up for a price tag. Hence, I would recommend going to a music store and taking the instrument home with me.<n>4. I have found in my travels that there was no way for you to get an instrument home and go home with it. You can purchase it through the store. I would recommend doing this because it is the way to travel with an instrument safely. I have found that all instruments are fragile and sensitive to sudden changes in temperature and air pressure. This could damage the instrument and make it more difficult to repair in the future.<n><n>### Input<n><n>Where would someone go to learn how to get a job from an engineer? Choices: 1.

However, my own show the next day went very smoothly.<n>3. This means the response would be the show the next day (Option B)<n>4. The audience is happy - so the response is an optimistic one.<n>5. My own show the next day has good reviews - so the response is that the show goes well.<n>6. The response is positive with information in the form of an anecdote where other responses were negative, so the best answer would be the positive statements (Option B)<n>### Input B:<n>Input: Which of the following types of information is considered positive? Choices:  Positive, Negative, Oral, Written (B)<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Informational statement: The audience was not satisfied in the show the day before.<n><n>### Question:<n>Which of the following types of statements is usually considered positive? Choice: Oral (Option C)<n><n>### Answer:<n>Oral (Option C) <n>### Explanation:<n>The type of positive information is an informal way to speak to each other. In this case the statement is negative because the audience is not satisfied so the answer would be an informal way of speaking.<n><n>### Input C:<n>1. The audience seemed satisfied in the show the next day.<n>2. This would be a positive feedback from the audience giving a positive sentiment.<n>3. The respondents indicated that a water fountain is the best place to get water which would be a positive result. <n>4. There were positive responses to the survey which would be a sign of a positive result.<n>5. Since there are more positives than negatives, then we know the feedback for thirst is a positive

Choices:  A: vent B: think C: shouting D: work off E: exercise<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: Option E: exercise<n><n>Rationales:<n>1. The question asks what would release energy, but mainly not in your muscles.<n>2. Analyzing the choices:<n>   - In the vent (option A), there is not much of an opportunity to release energy.<n>   - Thinking (option B) is a process of the brain, it doesn't release energy itself, but may help you release energy in other ways, such as exercise.<n>   - Shouting (option C) can, if you're very physically fit, lead to releasing some energy.<n>   - However, work off (option D) definitely leads to both releasing energy through muscular exertion, and the release of energy from the blood, sweat, and exertion of the muscles as well as the brain's release of endorphins.<n>   - Exercise (option E), which could also be an option to think (B), is the thing that could, if performed vigorously, could release the maximum amount of energy.<n>3. Hence, the answer can be thought of as the main way to release energy: exercise.<n>

Choices:  A: accomplish B: learn about C: money D: notoriety E: religion<n><n>### Response:		The correct option is C: learning about.<n><n>Reason:The question states that many people tell others about a new organization. While such talk may increase the organization's notoriety (Option E), learning about could probably only be accomplished by the people in question or those who may be in contact with new members. Therefore, A, B, and D are not correct options. Option E is a correct response here because if many people are talking about a new organization, it is probable that many people are also interested in learning about it instead of just the initial people who decided to talk about in the first place. <n><n>### Input:"What is the name of this product?" Choices: A: tux B: Linux Mint C: Ubuntu D: Linux distro E: all of these are operating systems<n><n>### Answer:"Linux Mint" is the correct answer.<n><n>Reason:"Linux Mint" would be the answer to this question. Option A (tux) is one of the logos of Linux and it's not an operating system. Option B (Linux Mint) is an operating system, and not Linux. Option C (Ubuntu) is an operating system. Option D (Linux distro) is very vague and could mean many things, but it could mean a distro of Ubuntu for example. Option E (all of these are operating systems) is not correct either since it would be technically incorrect to say all of the mentioned options are operating systems.

Choices:  A: finger B: good health C: own family D: friends E: people<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The correct answer is "own family".<n>Demostration: the person with brown skin. The one with brown skin might be a person or an animal. The person might be the color brown to other people or only to him. The person might have friends, have good health, own a pet dog that has brown skin, or simply have friends who are brown.<n><n>1. The correct answer is "own ____". Because of the question, we can't say that the person has "brown skin", as both "own family" and the word "brown skin" are possible answers.<n>2. We know that the person with brown skin shares the brown skin with his family, but it's not his good health. <n>3. We also know that the person may have friends. <n>4. In addition, the person likely owns pets or owns a home; those pets may also have the same skin color as the person who might actually be brown, or they may not.<n>5. Since it asks about the skin color, the answer is "own family", although it's not a definite possibility because of the other options.<n><n>### Input, response:<n><n>> The question asks a plumber if he ever got into trouble with a customer. Choices:  A. no, B. yes, C. no, D. yes, E. no<n><n>Rationales:The question asks if the plumber got into trouble with a client. He might have been working on a new faucet, gotten into a conflict over the fee, tried to fix a leak which the client disagreed on which repair would work, or simply have had an argument over a phone call. If he doesn't reply yes, then it is a mistake of the client to ask if he was ever in trouble with a client, not a mistake of the plumber.<n><n>1. It's possible the plumber says that  "n" is the problem, if he'd actually been in trouble with a client.<n>2. If he said "N" was the problem, it would mean that he had gotten into trouble, because he used the letter "n" for yes. <n>3. Hence, the correct response to the question would be the letter "y", as he'd been in trouble.<n><n>Answer:"B. yes"<n><n>### Inputs, answers

Choices:  A: alert B: deep sleep C: drink coffee D: open eyes E: conscious<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Rationales:<n><n>1. A person who is conscious (Option E) is presumably awaked.<n>2. The options:<n>   - Alert (Option B): refers to a person being in a state of wakefulness or agitation. This would not be the case for a person who is fully conscious (Option E).<n>   - Deep Sleep (Option C): refers to a condition in which the eyes are closed, and there is little or no movement. This refers to a physiological state and would not apply unless the person is also awaken (i.e., Option E).<n>   - Drink Coffee (Option D): refers to a person’s consumption of caffeine-containing substances before getting some sleep. This wouldn’t help determine if a person is awake, as it doesn’t indicate the state of consciousness.<n>3. The answer: The person whose sleeping pattern is known to the person or people who are answering the question is conscious in the wakeful sense (Option E).<n><n>Answer: E: conscious<n><n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>### Input<n>I am looking for a word that means the same as “the other thing” when used in a sentence that includes both a "good" or "nice" word and one that means the oposite of good or nice.<n>Examples:<n>- My grandmother was very strict.<n>- My ___ were always my best feature.<n>- A bunny, on the other hand, is very cuddly and nice.<n>Rationales: "the other thing" is the only possibility that works. But this is ambiguous. One of them is obviously a positive term, the other a negative one. The one that is a bit more likely is one that can be both positive or negative. The answer has to be the other thing, when used appropriately.<n><n>### Input 2<n>I am looking for the same sort of word that means “the other thing.”<n>Examples:<n>	- My grandmother, on the other hand and nice<n>	- A bunny on the other hand<n>	- On the other hand is very nice<n><n>### Answer 1<n>The word is on the other hand.<n><n>### Answer2:<n>The word is the on the other hand.

Humans can't lay eggs.<n><n>Eating fruit has nothing to do with racing.<n><n>Both wrestling (Option D) and competition (Option E) are sports. There's no mention of sports in the question, and we don't know what "compete" is in this context.<n>

Therefore, the answer is definitely B - people are likely having an enjoyable time playing the games.<n>C: This option explicitly mentions that people are happy when playing games. So, it's more likely to be the correct answer.<n>B: People can feel relaxed after playing a game if they've had a busy day or a long week. But the overall trend is likely to be one of enjoyment.<n>C: While these answers may seem to overlap, you can make a solid case that people are happy and relaxed when they play a game.<n>D: There is no mention of deceit or cheating anywhere here. If a game were to involve cheating, it's unlikely to be considered fun.<n>E: There is no option mentioning that winning is a result of cheating or stealing, or that it is in any way damaging to society. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is likely be that winning is enjoyable.<n><n>### Input<n>A new store just opened on the East Coast. It is called West Coast Company. What happens?

Choices:  A: pet the dog B: hear sounds C: have sex D: reproduce E: drive cars<n><n>### Response:		When humans are exposed to no sounds, they stop breathing, which kills them.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>This instruction presents a multiple choice question, wherein, we are asked where humans can find some plumbing which would not be useful to us if we are thirsty. There are 5 options we can choose from:<n>  - A: Oil Refineries<n>  - B: Wall<n>  - C: Show<n>  - D: Own Home<n>  - E: Water Fountain<n>Of these options, one might say that a wall would be a good source of water, if the question said “Where could you find some plumping that would be useful if you were thirst?”.<n><n>Because the question asks to find a non-helpful source of water, we must not consider this option – as we could not consider water inside the wall a helpful tool towards fighting thirst.<n><n>Next, we see that the options include “where could you find some pluming that would not be useful if you were to quench your thirst?” – the question is specific, implying that the question is looking for plumbing, and the correct answer must have pipes/water, but they mustn’t help you quench your thirt.<n><n>We consider the options:<n>* oil refineries – the oil that is being pumped through refineries would be highly useful to humans, so it is out.<n>* Wall – in this case, the phrase “on your own” means “by yourself” – we do not need water from a show to quench our thirst, as we are asking about the helpfulness of the pipe, rather, the pipe itself. The answer must involve pipes.<n>* Show – the phrase “show” could refer to a number of things. Plumbing could be one of them. We do not know what the “answer to the question” includes. We do not wish to get into semantics. We do not know the answer would be the show, so the question must be answered using pipes and water.<n>* Own Home – this is an option many would consider, but to which answer do we attribute it to? The pipes? The water? Or the home? The answer is none of the above, but includes all 3! It is highly unlikely for water to be of use to the pipes.<n>*

Choices:  A: age grieving person B: heart attacks C: depression D: hair loss E: headache<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. Stress could result in age-related ailments, such as heart attacks, depression or hair loss. However, there's no need to treat these from a medical standpoint.<n>2. Stress could result from headaches, but they would usually not result in death.<n>3. Stress could result or lead to depression, but that also wouldn't cause death.<n>4. A person on their deathbed is not going to be dealing with many of the symptoms, such as losing hair, as they will have dealt with the stress-related symptoms long before. Death results from an external factor or illness.<n>5. These symptoms wouldn't normally cause death; rather, it would be the underlying illness that causes death. Stress might cause other symptoms, but not death.<n>6. Stress could cause hair loss, but that, again, would have pre-dated the death of the person, so wouldn't have been the cause of death.<n>7. Stress could cause heart attacks, but again that wouldn't immediately cause death; rather, the heart disease would be more of a pre-existing condition that causes death.<n>8. Stress might cause a headache, but it likely won't mean that death is imminent.<n>9. Stress could result, or even lead to hair loss, but that wouldn't necessarily cause grieving or death, as hair loss often precedes death from other health issues and heart failure.<n>10. Only death causes death.<n><n>Answer: D: death<n>

First, they can protect their owners by alerting to potential threats (e.g., strangers outside the house), and by deterring unwanted visitors (e.g., by barking at them). Second, they can help people with exercise and mental health by going on walks with them. Dogs' sense of smell could also help find missing people by sniffing out their scents (Dhaliwal, 2019).<n><n>In addition, cats are helpful in many ways. First, they are often great pets who have a soothing effect on people. They can provide mental stimulation, affection, and even relief from stress (Cat Fanciers Club, 2018). They can also help maintain cleanliness by getting rid of flies and other rodent-like pests (PetMD, 2013). Furthermore, they have been known to have a calming effect on people. For those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), their presence has been shown to reduce symptom severity and help improve quality of life (Jankowska et. al, 2015).<n><n>All in all, both dogs and cats have many different ways they can offer a positive impact on the lives of humans.<n>Dhaliwal, S.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question asks where you would find some plumbing that would not be useful in relieving your thirst.<n>2. This means we're looking for a place where plumbing exists, but it doesn't carry potable water.<n>3. Analyzing the options:<n>   - Oil refineries (Option A) use extensive plumbing, but it's for transporting oil, not water.<n>   - The Wall (Option B) might have plumbing inside it for water transportation, which you could possibly use if you were thirsty.<n>   - The Show (Option C) could refer to a variety of things, including shows with plumbing displays. But these would probably have potable water.<n>   - Own home (Option D) would assuredly have useful plumbing for drinking water.<n>   - Water fountain (Option E) definitely would have plumbing carrying potable water.<n>4. Hence, the answer is the oil refineries (Option A) as there wouldn't be drinkable water there.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>### Input:Where might a yard be tiny? Choices:  A: farmland B: neighborhood C: city D: property E: subdivision<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: farmland.<n><n>### Response Reasoning:<n>Analyzing the options: Option A refers to farmland, which would have limited room. Option B refers to a neighborhood, which might be defined as very small depending on the circumstances, but it's definitely not as small as farmland. Option C refers to "the city", which is not too small to be a yard. Option D refers to property or land, which means it could be very large, so again that would not be the case. Finally, Option E would refer to a subdivision, which is generally referring to very small landed properties, so definitely not "tiny". Hence, the answer is farmland (Option A).<n>

However, this could not happen if they were to compete in sports such as archery or boxing.<n>3. Analayzing the options:<n>    - Pain (Option B) is not a feasible reason because pain does not stop athletes from competing in competitions, as demonstrated by many sportsmen who have competed while in great pain.<n>    - Mudslide (Option C) is another incorrect option because mudslides typically involve rain.<n>    - Sweating (Option D) is also incorrect because sportsmen still compete in many sports even when their clothes become soaking wet due to sweat.<n>    - Injuries (Option E) is an appropriate answer. Competitions usually do not involve sportsmen whose health doesn't permit them to compete.<n>    - Rain (Option E) doesn't fit the instruction because it asks about why sportsmen cannot participate in the games. Rain does not prohibit sports participation, but it does cause some competitions to be cancelled.<n>4.

Write a function that prints out the string "Hello, " when prompted with the name of a first person pronoun<n>2. Write yet another function that will make the function from the previous question print "Hello, " out every one or two minutes<n>3. Write a function that takes a value from the user and prints out a sentence containing a greeting<n><n>### Tasks<n>1. Write the following function, prompting the user to enter a name. If it's "me," the function should print out the string "Hello," otherwise it should print the user's input with no preamble.<n>```<n>def greet():<n>    print('Enter your Name')<n>    name = input()<n>    if (name == "me"):<n>        print("Hello") #if I enter “I” the program should print “Hello”<n>    else:<n>        print(name) # the user has to enter "me" for this to work correctly<n>```<n>2. Write this function, which will invoke the greet function from the previous question on a specific schedule. The first time you call the function, the greet function will be called immediately. But every time after you call the function, it will be called in a delay of one or two minutes.<n>```<n>def schedule_greet():<n>    time.sleep(2) # this doesn’t work<n>    print('time.sleep() not working.

Now we have a function that we can invoke at certain times. Write the greet function, which will take a value from the user as input, then print out a sentence containing the following: "Hello " (the input value) ":"<n>```<n>def greeter(word):<n>    print('Hello'+ word + ':')<n>```<n><n>

The question asks, if the small cabin from the start was not available, what other option do they have?<n>2. Considering the options are:<n>A: Villa - Villa means a villa or villa estate. Which doesn't quite fit here (they don't mean that they are traveling to a villa or a villa estate, so let's ignore it)<n>B: Spacecraft - This is a likely option. They can get to their spacecraft and board it for their destination<n>C: Hall - A hall is a type of structure or a building with two end walls. Doesn't make sense for this scenario, however.<n>D: Palace - A palace as a building was only used by royalty in the past, so it doesn't make sense.<n>E: Hotel - This is a fairly solid option, since it fits with the description that the small cabin would not work, and the options are now "upgraded". So, the answer has to be a hotel.<n>(E) Answer: E: hotel<n><n><n>### Input:"Isabella, this is unacceptable," the director said.

Choices:  A. stove, B. deep pot, C. dish pan, D. electric pot, E. pot with stove built in, F. fire pot<n>### Rationales:<n><n>1. The instructions ask for something at a grocery that contains the word pot.<n>2. We can look for all of these options to see if any of them contain pots or pot (or pots, since the letters at the end of the word are also capitalized.)<n>3. Stove (Option A) is not a pot at all—just what you would use to cook in a pot.<n>4. Deep Pot (Option B) seems a very promising candidate, and could be used to do many things (like boil a pot), so it would qualify.<n>5. Dish pan (Option C) is another promising candidate but isn't defined here, so we would need more information about its shape or use.<n>6. Pot with Stove Built In (Option D) is a bit vague; we also don't know whether it has to have stove built-in (if you bought a stove and tried to install it in an Easy Bake Oven, you could get away with that; the stove might be separate or it could have a stove with a stove built in.)<n>7. Fire Pot (Option E) seems like a reasonable option. Again, since fire pots vary so much (you can take an ordinary stove from home and put it on a campfire), it's unclear.<n>8. Electric Pot (Option F) is yet another plausible option, which could indicate using a stovetop instead of heat sources we're more familiar with here at home.<n>9.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question asks where you would find some plumbing that would not be useful in relieving your thirst.<n>2.

Choices:  A: let down B: respect C: illness D: satisfaction E: gratitude<n><n>### Response:		<n>I understand your point: You've been doing favors at work at no real benefit to you, apart from perhaps goodwill. It seems frustrating not to get any recognition, any kind of return on your investment into your co-workers. Therefore, the answer could be C, it's not that these co-workers you've been trying to please are ill... but rather, they're not returning the gratification!<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>1. The question states that there are people that He has done favors for at work, but does not receive any gratification or return on his efforts. This gives credence that there is a correlation between the actions and receipt of a gratification response.<n>2. The "it" in the first answer choice (Let down) is referring to "He" in the first sentence, which would be the recipient of favors. This means that the second answer choice (Let down), the action of receiving something, should be ruled out as well.<n>3. The "it" could also represent any action the receiver has already done in return, such as doing a favor or giving gifts. If this is true, the action would be to be ill (the action), and gratitude is the receipt of some form of gratitude.<n>4.

Choices:  A: play chess B: sun themselves C: wrong house D: set table E: gettable<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Rationales:<n><n>1. This is asking how confused children might go if they wanted to get home.<n>2. This is asking how you might go home (the "home" in question is the children's house, not your own home).<n>3. Analyzed and sorted out into the following options:<n>   - Play Chess - This seems like what you'd play during time off, if you had the time to do so.<n>   - Sun themself - They could set out on a picnic, or go to the beach or pool to play.<n>   - Wrong house - This is not a good thing to do.<n>   - Set table - This also seems non-necessary outside of a chess game.<n>   - Gettable - This is what you're supposed to do in this context.<n>4. Hence it's gettable (Option E) that will make sense in this context.<n>Answer: E: gettable<n>

Analyzing the given options:<n>   - Moccasins (Option D) might lead you to think they could be useful for this type of use case.<n>   - They might let you avoid spending the day with painful feet.<n>   - But they're primarily made for comfort rather than protection, and they might not prevent you from having sore feet if you wore uncomfortable shoes on your trip.<n>   - High Heels (Option E) could lead you to believe that this may protect your feet through a thick shoe sole.<n>   - They're also known for their tall design, which might make them useful against soreness and injuries brought about by constant walking.<n>   - Cake (Option B) and Athletic Shoes (Option C) may not necessarily prevent soreness or injury brought about by travel. So they're not suitable for the question.<n><n>3.

Choices:  A: necessity B: answers C: inspiration D: love E: fun<n><n>### Response:		<n>Chatty people will chat.  If there's a desire to communicate, it will be communicated by the person who desires to communicate.  And if they don't communicate, they aren't chatty.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>People have a desire to connect with others, and this desire will be satisfied by them acting for their desires.  There isn't some magical force that can prevent someone from communicating their desire to communicate.  I understand that some people may have social anxiety, and thus may have the desire to communicate but may feel anxious about that communication, or feel they may be judged badly for communication, which would stifle their ability to communicate.<n><n>### Inputs:<n>People who go naked are not in a place to wear clothing.<n><n>### Response<n>They can be in a place to wear clothes, just now they are not.<n><n>### Example:<n>You are in London, they can be in a place/locality to wear clothes in London.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. Nakedness implies no clothing.<n>2. The first step is finding the place/locality where clothing is to be worn.<n>3. The question does not mention a time element in it at all. This leaves it open.<n>4. So the correct answer is London.<n>

The person can shout, using their voice to ask them to talk. Shouting means being loud enough to be heard above the surrounding or ambient noise, or other voices.<n>2. They can cross the room to where the other person is, a different way of using sight to get their attention.<n>3. They could also smile<n>4.

Choices:  A: smile B: shake hands C: express gratitude D: say you're welcome E: appreciate compliment<n><n>### Response:		<n>As we all know the best way to go about this is to appreciate the compliment. And the reason is because the compliment is for you as we should appreciate what others have done for or said to us, especially when it's a compliment to you. (Option E)<n><n>### Input :Which of the following is a way to express sadness if we learned that someone is leaving? Choices:  a. say nothing b. hold a party c. say "you'll always be remembered d. start crying e. tell them "thank you for helping me"<n><n>### Rationales:<n>a. Saying nothing would be a noncommittal way of expressing sadness. You don't necessarily appreciate them and there is no way to express it. (Option a)<n>b. Holding a party is great if someone is going away on a trip, but it wouldn't convey sadness. (Option b)<n>c. I would never start crying about someone for leaving as that wouldn't send the proper signal. If I were sad, I'd probably say "thanks" first and then get to expressing my emotions after. (Option d)<n>d. Telling them I'll always remember them is something I would say if I were truly sad. Although it works in this situation too. (Option e)<n>Answer: e. tell them "you'll always remember them"<n><n>### Input (SAT 2021): What is the most appropriate way to show you are not happy? (Choices: a. grin b. express enthusiasm c. display happiness d. say “thanks” e. gush.)<n><n>### Response (SAT 2/4/2021):<n>Expressing enthusiasm would be the wrong reaction. Grinning or saying thank you would be inappropriate, but in the correct circumstances. I've seen many situations where my best friend would be extremely enthusiastic and say thank you without any emotions.  Since we're saying we're not happy, I find it appropriate to gush over, which shows emotions.  (Grinning: A) (Expressing Happiness: B) (Displaying Happiness: D) (Saying Thank You: C) (Gushing: E)<n><n>## Instructions

Choices:  A: smile B: singing C: sweat D: act E: dance<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales:  1. The question asks what someone can be doing while performing that would not be enjoyable for deaf people, which we're looking for an activity which deaf people would not be able to enjoy for themselves at the same time as someone else is enjoying it.<n>2. It's important here to notice the ambiguity of the word "enjoy", because "enjoy" in itself means "to take pleasure in", which can mean enjoyment for a second person or the pleasure the person is experiencing.<n>3. Analysing the options:<n> - Smile (A)—Deaf people might not know what someone is trying to express with a smile or how to interpret it, and wouldn't know when people around them are trying to smile at them.<n> - Singing (B)—Deaf people can't "listen to the words" being sung.<n>5. Sweat (C) and acts (D) both require that people do something, so deaf people wouldn't be able to enjoy the process.<n>6. Hence, the answer will be someone (E) sweat as there's no activity or action in there, just something that happens to you.<n><n>Answer: E: dance<n>

This means we're looking for a place where plumbing exists, but it doesn't carry potable water.<n>3.

Hence, the answer is the oil refineries (Option A) as there wouldn't be drinkable water there.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>### Input:His day at the office was nearing an end, he went to the start menu on his computer to do what? Choices:  A: run programs B: play games C: control model D: power down E: reason exists<n><n>### Response:		<n>Run programs (Option A) was the correct answer. The start menu on a computer functions as an interface or a portal, and does not “power down.” The correct answer is the opposite of what the question asked—the menu enables your computer to do things (such as power down), but it does not itself do these things.<n><n>### Additional details:<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. The question said “his day at the office was… nearing an end” so that’s what we should think of his day as being.<n>2. “Nearing an end” sounds like something is coming to a close. What closes is something that he does at the office, not an interface on his computer.<n>3. If he is at the office, he would log in and use his computer. What is in the menu is a list of things that you can do, not a step-wise process.<n>4. For the question “what would you find near an end?” you would consider an interface (on a computer), such as the menu. However, the interface itself isn’t what one could find near an end, but the steps one could take.<n>5. Hence, this answer choice is incorrect.<n>6. The phrase “the start menu on his computer _______” suggests the menu will help you do something. For example, “power down” refers to doing something to a computer/smartphone or a system—it’s not about the menu.<n>### A final piece of context<n><n>* The question is about what is useful in your office. A person’s office has many useful things, so it is likely that a few of them are found in the start menu. If a person were going to their office, he or she would use the menu to get to the files that they use regularly.<n>### Instruction<n><n>### Write a response that appropriarily completes the request.

Choices:  A: war B: aircraft carrier C: sky D: graveyard E: crash<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Explaination:<n>### Demonation:<n><n>### Author:Venkatachalam K<n><n>#### Answer: The answer is the aircraft carrier. To answer this question, we'll first look at the options and see if there a non-airplane item in each.<n><n>### First, the war (Option B) would be in use.<n><n>### Next, it's unlikely that the planes in the sky (Option C) would be used for anything else. The crash (Option E) would probably be damaged, which isn't applicable to our question. So, we know 3 of the 5 are definitely out.<n><n>### The graveyard (Option D) could refer to anything from parking to graves, which could only be ruled out (Option E) if they were being used. Additionally, "graves" doesn't seem to fit in the question, such that this one is out of the list, leaving us with the aircraft carrier <n> Answer: C: aircraft carrier<n><n>### Answer: A: the bar (option A).<n><n>### Response To: If someone could find themselves in a room with a bat that might not be able to help them with its wings, what type of room are they likely to be in? Choices: <n>1. A: office 2. B: church 3. C: restaurant D: bar E: prison<n><n>Author: Venkatachalam Khanna<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Option A: office: The most logical place for this bullish baton to be in is probably an office. I'm not super sure, and a lot of logic can be applied to other rooms, but this one just seems to fit.<n><n>Option B: church: I've never quite seen a bat in a church, but I'm sure they have some sort of bats. It might be helpful to some sort of priest. (But this priest might be a mute.)<n><n>Option C: restaurant: Not so crazy, though the bullishness of the baton might not help in a restaurant setting unless in a bull-related event, or even then.<n><n>Option D: bar: This makes the most sense to me, with a bull-raising, bullish baton.<n><n>Option E: Prison
Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question asks where you would find some plumbing that would not be useful in relieving your thirst.<n>2. This means we're looking for a place where plumbing exists, but it doesn't carry potable water.<n>3. Analyzing the options:<n>   - Oil refineries (Option A) use extensive plumbing, but it's for transporting oil, not water.<n>   - The Wall (Option B) might have plumbing inside it for water transportation, which you could possibly use if you were thirsty.<n>   - The Show (Option C) could refer to a variety of things, including shows with plumbing displays. But these would probably have potable water.<n>   - Own home (Option D) would assuredly have useful plumbing for drinking water.<n>   - Water fountain (Option E) definitely would have plumbing carrying potable water.<n>4. Hence, the answer is the oil refineries (Option A) as there wouldn't be drinkable water there.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>### Input:Long term consumption of beer can lead to all sorts of problems, it can be quite what? Choices:  A: water B: liquid C: foamy D: intoxicating E: harmful<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The instruction is to write correctly the answer to the given question. The first sentence is, "long term consumption of beer". So we have to choose one word, or phrase, whose meaning matches with the given sentence. The "long term consumption" phrase is an adjective phrase, which modifies the verb "could". The sentence refers to "the consumption of beer", so we need to match it with adjective phrases which are used for the consumption of something. Now, we will examine the given list. The first one is "water", this could be referring to a substance that gets consumed often, but it doesn' t mean consumed in long term. Hence, we can reject "water" as a possible answer as it doesn't match the meaning of the question.<n><n>Next, we have "liquid", this is a possible answer for the question as liquids are consumed in different forms.<n><n>The third one is "foamy", now the sentence refers to beer, and, yes, beer has foam which means there could possibly be foaming in it. But this does not necessarily mean it could cause foaming like the bubbles or foam we see on a coke can or a cappuccino. So this cannot be used as the "beer could cause foaming" sentence in the question and that is why you can reject it as well.<n><n>Next, as far as we have understood "intoxicating" means it could make one's mind clouded, but again how that happens is not known and the sentence refers to "beer". We know that beer doesn't intoxicate one' s mind as much as other drinks like alcohol or whiskey, so we can easily reject "intoxicating" from the list as well.<n><n>And the last option, "harmful", is possible if the beer causes any sort of harm. But here also, we couldn' t find any substance which describes a harmful element in the beer, so this also can be rejected as a possible choice.<n><n>From the above list of the given options, we chose only one option which seems to fit perfectly into the question, the only option we chose is B as "liquid".<n><n>The instruction is: Find out the missing word. Answer: "Long term consumption of bee__"<n><n>### Instructions:Find the missing word.

Choices:  A: wooded area B: body of water C: the ocean D: british columbia E: zoo<n><n>### Response:		<n>I chose C as the answer. In order to do this, I had to go through the options and determine which of them were not correct. One option that was obviously incorrect was A: wooded area because they would not leave that area since their home is there, but the other choices were closer.<n><n>There were three choices that seemed to fit the description of a body of water: a lake, the ocean, and a body of water. In order to solve this choice I eliminated the British Columbia choice because it was not related to the body of water so I crossed that answer off. I then asked myself if it was the lake or the ocean and I chose the ocean choice (choice B) because I think that a beaver would leave the water it is in to explore the land around it rather than vice versa.<n><n>### Input- 1,Ans,Answer:Find the next word in the following sentence:<n>"As you might suspect, the answer is A, but not because the question is asking where I was going after leaving the ________. It's because the question is trying to fool you into missing that the word before it is not the answer to the question. When the question says, "Where would someone find a plumbing store? Choices: A: Walmart" I'm looking for a word that goes in the blank that does not relate to the sentence.<n>

Choices:  A: redemption B: isolation C: absolution D: great relief E: feel better<n><n>### Response:		<n>There isn't enough information to determine the correct answer. If I know anything about the forgiving person, it could help to determine the answer. For example, if the forgiving person is a Christian, then what is the answer? There are still four options to choose from. But if the person is not a Christian (or is unknown), then the answer is unclear since "foregiveness" may mean totally different things to different people.<n><n>### Input if I had a forgiving attitude toward my child, what would I receive? Choices: A: redemption, B: isolation C, Absolution, D: great relief, E: feel better.<n><n>### Response<n>Again if I do not know anything about the forgiver that information is still needed. For example, if I have a forgiving relationship with my ex-husband I might get a "great relief". But if the marriage ended due to mutual incompatibilities and we can never see each other again, the answer could be "nothing". So it's again the same issue as before.<n><n>###Input:The two-lane road went through an open area of land with many farmhouses.

C: You will want to cross the street. D: You will be exhausted. E: You will come to a fork in the road.<n><n>###Response<n>There's no way of knowing whether there is road construction. One or more buildings (Option A) and even the scenery (Option B) could be covered under a construction sign. The other three options can be true, but do NOT answer the question. If we were driving through and the next "street" was forked, then we would ask (i) which direction to turn and (ii) if we could go anywhere before we had to return.<n><n>### The two-lane road went around a mountain before crossing a bridge over a river.

We have been talking about it on the phone, but I haven't been keeping up with all of that.<n><n>### Response:"Has my cousin been speaking with me on the phone about her upcoming vacation?"<n>#### Rationales<n><n>1. The answer to the question of whether your Mom has ever visited a dentist is no, and therefore the answer to another question about her dental visit is no.<n>2. The answer to the second question is no. She would have to visit a dentist to be on vacation, so it should be no.<n>3. The answer is yes; my cousin called before about the trip, but I haven' know when the trip was going on, and I didn't speak to her.<n>4. My cousin was on vacation! That's what being on vacation means!<n><n>Answer: C.: My cousin's dentist is at home<n><n>### Output:What is happening with the show I told you about when I spoke with my Mom about the dentist?<n><n>### Response<n><n>The show I told Mom about is called the "Good News Hour," which is only broadcast in Canada, so I don't know what happened on the show. That said, I'm guessing it's a show that focuses on good news.<n><n>#### Rationales:<n><n>1. "I saw my Mom visit a dentist" and "I have been talking to my Mom about the show on the phone" lead to the conclusion that I spoke to my Mom about her dentist visit to me.<n>2. I don't

Choices:  A: books B: zoo C: body of water D: wooded area E: animals<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question states that a beaver builds structures to what type of feature to block. A "feature" could refer to geographical features like mountains or bodies of water. The only option that makes sense that bears that description of what a beaver dam is doing is option C: block a body of water. This, though, is not an option, so to answer the question we can simply eliminate all B and C choices which are not an option. We are left with options A and D.<n><n>### Alternately, we could analyze the individual words and see that the beaver is building something to cover over the body of water. A dam is a structure that will block or cover up a body of water. If beaver were building some feature to block the body of water, it would be called a dam.<n><n>Answer: A: beaver dam<n><n>### Input-Drive to a town about 20 minutes away and call a store called the "5&10" to see if they sell a particular book.<n><n>### Input:- Call a place called the 5&10 to check if they sell the book<n><n>### Instance where the two do not match:<n>**Input: - Call a place called the "5& 10" to check if they sell a particular movie. _ This means that they do not sell a particular movie, rather they sell everything. <n>**Input: Drive to a town about 60 minutes away **Input: Drive to a place called the 60 Minute Town. _This refers to an area, not a store or any particular place.

The last weekend in August is the time to book a room at the best price, if a hotel stay is needed.  What should be done prior to the trip? Choices: A: Rush B: Be prepared C: Wait D: Act immediately E: None of these<n><n>### Response<n>Rationales:<n>1. The question states that the best way to get a good room at a hotel in Miami is to book early.<n>2. The question does not state that "rush" is the correct answer.<n>3. Analysing the choices:<n>   - "Rush" - Not the best answer for the question, as it's not very clear what "rush" could mean.<n>   - "Be prepared" - We can be prepared to book a hotel, but that doesn't mean that we can actually get a room. We need to book the hotel first.<n>   - "Wait" - We shouldn't wait because we can already book a room with the information in the question.<n>   - "Act immediately" - We should take action as soon as possible, and that's what this answer is suggesting.<n>4. Hence the answer is "Act immediately."<n>Answer: Act immediately.<n>

Choices:  A: short term B: crowd C: unpredictable D: frequent E: eternal<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is E: eternal<n>The parties are never crowded or unpredictable and they are also not frequent.<n><n>### Rationales<n><n>The question says "How often are secular Parties held?" and the options provided are : short term, crowd, unpredictable, frequent and eternal.<n><n>From this, we know that there are parties, they are always held and they don't tend to be frequent and are unpredictable.<n><n>We now look at each option in order to find the correct one as it's the first letter of the first option that is correct.<n><n>**short term** - We know that the Parties are always held and are not frequent because there are no other options provided in the question, this leads us to eliminate option A.<n><n>**crowd** - As the parties are often held, it's not unpredictable and it's not possible for them to be frequent, so we don't choose option B.<n><n>**unpredictable** - As the parties often come around every day, they can't be frequent and not be unpredictable which leaves us to eliminate option C.<n><n>**frequent** - The parties are frequent in the sense that they are always held and so it's unpredictable and frequent in the sense that we don't know how often they'll come back. This leads us to not choose option D.<n><n>**Eternal** - Eternal is never frequent but is always held. This satisfies the first letter of the options, so this is the correct answer.<n><n>### Additional Questions<n><n>1. The correct answer choice for the first part of the question is the word "B" because it is on the left-hand side of the line to the right of the question mark in the sentence, and it is also the first word of the sentence. The answer choice for the second part of the question could only be selected if it was on the left-hand of the line to the left of the question mark in th sentence, which it isn't.<n><n>2. It refers to a time in the past when someone was unpopular because they were being mocked.<n><n>3. They are not popular because they aren't a popular band.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question asks where you would find some plumbing that would not be useful in relieving your thirst.<n>2. This means we're looking for a place where plumbing exists, but it doesn't carry potable water.<n>3. Analyzing the options:<n>   - Oil refineries (Option A) use extensive plumbing, but it's for transporting oil, not water.<n>   - The Wall (Option B) might have plumbing inside it for water transportation, which you could possibly use if you were thirsty.<n>   - The Show (Option C) could refer to a variety of things, including shows with plumbing displays.

Choices:  A: choose one B: get comfortable C: bought a book D: learn to read E: open up<n><n>### Response:		Answer the multiple choice question as below.<n><n>### Choices:A: choose one B: learn to read D: read a book E: own books<n><n>Rationales:1. It appears the robot is actually reading books now.<n>2. It doesn't necessarily have to choose one book to read; it can read as many as it wants.<n>3. The robot isn't comfortable; it is more likely to be learning to read based on the first sentence alone as the robot had chosen books previously.<n>4. The robot doesn't necessarily have books to read; it is more likely that it bought books if it began reading them.<n>5. It's more likely that the robot open books to read them. Since they are still new to reading, it would probably have to reference the books while studying.<n><n>#### Answer: B: learn to read<n><n>### Input:"It's not really a chihuahua. Do not do that again" She said, the owner gave it a treat after it had done what? Choices A: ate the shoes B: played with the cat C: sniffed the newspaper D: slept through the night E: cried a little for its mother<n><n># Instructions: Answer the multiple choice questions.<n><n>### Options: A: ate the shoe B: played with the car C: sniffed on the paper D: slept through night and cried a little for its mom<n><n>Rationales 1. The owner said that it's not really a Chihuahua. <n>2. We're also given that the owner gave it a snack after it had done something.<n>3. It would be strange for someone to give the dog a'sniff' as sniff is an action (eats, plays. etc.). <n>4. In the sentence it says 'played with the cat'. This would mean cat would be an object of the action (in the sentence).<n>5. It would also be awkward to give a'sniff' to the car as a sniff would be the movement of the nose.<n>6. The sentence uses the word'slept through the night and cried a little'. This gives us that the owner had to wake up twice with the dog. <n>7. This leaves sniffed as a probable answer for the action the dog did (sniff

(2) Why are these questions different?<n><n>#### Rationales:<n>(1) The student's objective here is what the professor is saying vs. where the plumbing can't be used for relieving a dry throat.<n>In the former, you're asking for something specific, in the latter, a more general location of where the plumbing is but cannot be used for water.<n>(2) These are structurally very different; an answer (as in the second question) about what the professor is saying would have to be a noun phrase, such as "his lecture".<n>The location question about plumbing, on the other hand, would have to have a transitive verb (e.g. "can't use") and an object (e.g. in this case, "plumbing")<n><n>### Input:#40:  Which part of speech would the underlined word be?

(2) Here we're looking at something they took with them for "travel purposes" that, when brought, was on vacation with them (i.e. "took a vacation with you")<n>(3) Analyzing the options (a guitar, a tent, a camera, etc.), these are not things brought because they were needed for recreational purposes. For example, a guitar would not have been brought because of a musical performance that would take place on vacation.<n>(4) The bottle of water would be the correct answer.<n>

Most ice boxes are now obsolete because of the wide use of modern refrigerators today.<n><n>### Deductive Reasoning<n><n>Ice box -> old<n>old -> antique store<n><n>Hence, the ice box can be disposed to an antique store<n><n>### Response 2<n><n>The junkyard is where used things are sent to be resold. There is no proper term for an ice box but an ice box is used as part of a refrigeration system that consists of an icebox, an ice bin and a freezer. Ice box -> Ice<n>Ice ->  Junkyard<n><n>Hence, ice box can be disposing to junkyard.<n><n>### Response with multiple steps<n><n>The refrigeration system needs to cool something to prevent it from spoiling. When the appliance is used, the cold air condenses and accumulates.<n><n>#### Ice box<n><n>The ice boxes were introduced in the late 1800s. It is a device that contains ice to cool things.

Choices:  A: grandma B: clothing C: jewelry store D: clothes E: fabric store<n><n>### Response:		<n>C - Clothing store<n>### Explaination:<n>Since you're looking for a specific kind of fabric, the person you ask most likely knows a tailor or a seamstress who might have what you need. Also, you will find lots of other kinds of material besides just what you would use to make a quilt, so you might even make a jacket, or a dress, or a skirt if the tailor has other kinds of material.<n>### <n>### Instruction : I found no candy at the movie theater, so I left empty handed.<n><n>### Response<n><n>So I left empty handed. Why didn't the sentence end here? Because it is very easy to make people sound like they make up stories. If you make sure something didn’t happen, follow it with the word “didn’t”. This tells the reader that it is what you meant and that you also checked on what was happening at the movie theater and found that you didn’t find anything to eat.<n><n>### <n><n>### Instructions:<n>You're tired of waiting on lines. So you set out to find a more efficient way of finding parking, and to do this, you ask five random people where they think the best place for parking is.<n><n>### Explanation/Response:<n>I think the person should ask the question in a different way. Instead of "Where would be the best place to park near the store?", I would say "Where is a convenient place to park that's not too far from the store?"<n>### <n>The people asked are not supposed to give up a location that has already been sold, so the person isn't able to make a choice about the location where she would go.<n>The explanation is:<n>To make an accurate decision you need all information at hand. In this situation, you cannot make an accurate decision without this information.<n><n>### Note:<n>So I'd like to know, if I ask a person to suggest to me a good place. It is not necessary to get the best place to park!<n><n>### Instrument:<n>I have written a few sentences, which illustrate that I’ll ask a person for suggestions which are not meant to be used by me:<n><n>The person who is asked for advise might suggest somewhere in the neighborhood, which is not very convien

Choices:  A: hear crowd go mad B: working hard C: clap D: reproduce E: celebrate<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales:<n>This question asks us to identify the band members’ ritual before every concert. And that sounds like exactly what we have to do here.<n><n>Analyzing the options: It's important to keep in mind that if a band enjoys success and fans, that will mean they are well-known, likely popular, maybe famous. It will also likely mean they have an established practice of doing something before each concert. We would need to ask: Did each of the options occur as bands’ practices?<n><n>The answer to that question turns out to be no, unless we allow for the possibility of doing something other than what's specified in the choices. So let's explore the options.<n><n>Option A, “hear crowd go mad” means that bands enjoy it, and they will experience joy whenever their fans become ecstatic. No, not really their ritual, right?<n><n>Option B looks like it could work. After all, music is what bands (generally) play for audiences in concerts. If bands work hard, they will (generally) play music. And that could mean they have some kind of ritual before going on stage, which would resemble working hard. It's not a certainty, but if one option is likely to be true of bands, we want it to be this one.<n><n>Option C looks like something a band would do in the pre-concert ritual. We certainly clap our hands for bands during live show, or while listening to their music, so it fits!<n><n>On the other hand, option D is a little more ambiguous. Would they do a copy (reproduction)? Is that their ritual? Well, what do bands usually do? A variation on that question is: How would this option work as a pre-concert rituals?<n><n>Option E works a lot like Option D, so it’s likely to be an unlikely answer.<n><n>While an argument can be made for one of the three remaining options, it’s still uncertain. Therefore, I’ll go with the one that least strains credulity: Option D: reproduce. The pre-concert ritually may involve reproducing their popular music.<n><n>So, the correct answer is reproduced songs/music (Option D).

The question asks where should you get barbecue sauce.<n>2. This would be done at a barbecue food establishment, and we're specifically looking for a store.<n>3. Analysing the options:<n>4.  We are told that we want sauce, and the options are a town, a park, a cafe, a restaurant, and a grocery store (Option E).<n>    1. It's inappropriate to use a restaurant to get sauce you need for cooking (Option D), so this can be excluded.<n>    2. "Hope you're thirsty! We've got water, but if you need a sauce, we'll get it for you." This would obviously refer to a grocery store that was also a restaurant. Since this would be a store, we can exclude this choice (Option E).<n>5. Since we're left with a town and a park, it would be more likely for the grocery store to have this, since they're more likely to have stores in towns.<n>8. Hence the town would probably be a good place to get barbecue sauces.<n>        Answer: A: detroit<n><n>### Rationale:You're trying to find an interesting place for lunch, where should you try?

The question asks where to have lunch, and what makes an interesting place.<n>1.  The options are a park, a city, and a park. The park is the only option that fits the first requirement, so it goes to the next round.<n>2.  The question then asks where should you can have a lunch, and the available option is a park.<n>3.  We are therefore asked for an interesting place. The options are two parks, so we're trying to pick between those two.<n>4.

Choices: a) lake b) manhattan c) shoreline d) coastal area e) los angeles<n>Rationales: The word "always" here means that a bay will always be found in its appropriate environment. There are several bay waters surrounding Manhattan, and we consider Manhattan as part of a coastal area or coastline. These are not part of the answer, because a bay will never be found there. A bay will never be found in Los Angeles either for the same reason. So this rules them out as answers. Next, a bay can only be found on a shoreline or a coastal area. But that makes it difficult to distinguish whether a bay is on the shoreline of a lake or a shoreline in a body of water. Thus, a bay can be found in a lake but not on land. In that case, a bay is found in Los Angeles.

The first option, *backyard* really is not the correct term for outdoor grilling. *Crock pot* should not have even been an option, and what they mean by *grilling*, I think, is like smoking meat.  What people really mean by *being outside* is they mean *barbequing*  when they mean something specific.  What you are describing to me is grilling, and it doesn't always have to be outside.  I have an indoor grill with a grill tray and a grill rack.  Sometimes I like to barbeque inside, because it can be toxic outside.  In Hawaii we are always exposed to smoke from the volcanoes and we cannot stand it all the time.  It gets in our lungs and makes me sick.  So, I prefer to cook inside.<n><n>### My thoughts on the subject:<n>The second paragraph of the article, *When is outdoor grilling the best cooking method?*, goes into

The question asks what type of sensor the expert was explaining the sensor uses as part of the system. In this case, he said it was a proximity sensor.<n>2. The words "proximity" and "proximity sensor" are synonymous, and they both refer to something like a distance sensor. They are not interchangeable. The "this" in the third sentence is likely referring to the word "proximity."<n>3. Analyz:<n>   - Closeness (Option C) refers to a similar concept as near, but one that is not necessarily geographic. This excludes the other answers.<n>   - Here (Option D) refers to the general subject, not the particular object discussed in the question.<n>   - This (Answer E) refers to the word "proxymity," hence the answer is proximity.<n>Answer: E: proximity<n><n>### Input The sensors would just sense the distance then set off the alarm, the installation expert explain it was called<n><n>### Response Instruction<n>Input: The sensor would just sense the distance, then set off the alarm.

The word "bouncing" can be taken literally to mean "a great deal of bouncing", where bouncing is an action you'd do in a bouncy place.<n>2. Thus, B says "the trampoline", implying that many bounces occur there.<n>3. Bouncing is an action, so the place of the action matters as well. <n>4.

A Beach (Option 1): while there may be some gentle bouncing (a bounce), there is usually no bouncing activity. <n>2. A Trampoline (Option 2): is the most obvious choice based on Bouncing and what it does in general.<n>3. A Wall (Option 3): A wall can be used to bounce off of, but it cannot absorb the energy, which means it wouldn't bounce.<n>4.

You can figure out what the choices are because the question reads "do drugs do".<n>So the question means "What do drugs do?" There are five choices - "D", "E", "C", "B" and "A", so we have to pick one of them as the best choice for what "do drugs do."<n>(2). There's no context clues in the question that help you eliminate options, so we have to rule out the options using rules from the question.<n>(3). For "cause illness", it doesn't matter which drugs are used.<n>(4). Rule out option "the" drugs in "A", which would cause too big of illness to fit the question.<n>(5). For "do" in "how do drugs do" (how the question reads), we have to pick the option that sounds like it can be used in the past.<n>(6). For "cause accident," you have to use the past tense of "cause accident," so it has to be "caused an accident," not "causing accident."<n>(7). So the answer is "caused disease" because it meets all those requirements.<n>Answer: Caused disease<n>

Choosing from the choices:<n>   - Hole (Option A) refers to different kinds of holes, such as the holes in the walls in which a door would be, or holes in a building where equipment is stored, for instance. <n>   - Television (Option B) is a device on which programs are played. This doesn't mean they are necessarily playing sports on the television, so it cannot be ruled out.<n>   - The Sporting Goods Store (Option C) would surely have balls available for sale, and employees might play with them. However, customers may also come in, see a ball, and play with that, then leave.<n>   - Pool Table (Option D) has people playing with a table called a pool table, but that doesn't necessarily have to do with sports. Additionally, playing pool doesn't necessarily require a ball, unless you use a cue stick.<n>   - The sporting event (Option E) is where people gather to watch sporting events.<n>3.

Choices:  A: factory B: construction site C: engine D: insides of skyscraper's walls E: shops<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>1. The options include construction sites, factories, and shops. The question asks about metal rods that the character tripped over so the answer must be in a place that contains those rods.<n><n>2. The factory (Option B) is a place where metals are made, but not necessarily the tools necessary for construction.<n><n>3. Similarly, the construction site (Option C) is a place where tools and metals are used for construction, but doesn't necessarily store the tools.<n><n>4. The engine of a skyscraper' may contain metals but not necessarily tools for construction.<n><n>5. The interiors of a skyscrape's wall do not typically contain building tools.<n><n>6. The shops or shopping malls (Option E) may have tools used for renovations or construction but it's not common.

Choices:  A: backery B: ham sandwich C: fridge D: butcher shop E: freezer<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: The butcher is likely the best place to find fresh, unprocessed meat. That said, the fridge in your home can have meat items last for longer than a ham sandwich (in theory, anyway). The ham sandwich isn't lasting something, it's perishable. And obviously "backery" isn't acceptable because it's nonsense.<n><n>### Input. Where would you least expect to find an orange, of all fruits? Choices: A: water fountain B: fridge C: wall D: oil refinery E: banana tree<n><n>### Response<n>The simplest answer is water fountain, even though it's not exactly true. But why would you even expect to find an orange at a fountain? And why would D be the best choice for water fountain? It doesn't make sense.<n><n>Anyway, it's going to be E. B is too short to be water, even though oil refineries aren't exactly long. C and D have the word fountain (although you could argue it's figurative). A doesn't apply at all. E and F are the only options with actual fruits in them.

"The Answer is a location where an everday device is stored". So, we can quickly conclude that this would never be an answer option.<n>- Desktop: The use of the option "desktop" suggests that we're looking for where an office employee would keep his/her everyday device (i.e. a calculator) if he had to. Also, the "everday device" would never be left lying around in this location. This suggests that this would never be the answer.<n>- Office: As above, we're looking to select a location where an every day device could be kept if the need were to arise. Also, we are explicitly looking for the location where an office employee keeps his calculator if he had to. As above, we can say that this is not the answer.<n>- City Hall: Well, this location does not seem useful for the description of "an everday use calculator".<n>- Wristwatch: We have not been given any information as to why somebody would carry a wristwatch.

If there's a question where you speak about ending a certain relationship status, it can be sure that you will have a divorce from a lawyer, the relationship was a marriage.<n>2. Since if you speak about ending a relationship, you will necessarily have to be single or not married. You will need a lawyer for this type of process of marriage, so choice D is the correct answer.

Choices:  A: feel cold B: feel pressure C: feel bumpy D: itches E: feel clammy<n><n>### Response:		<n>For this problem, the only answer that doesn't satisfy this request will be "b", so this can be the only answer. Note that "c", "d", and "e" are incorrect. Since skin pinched in something should make the skin feel cold, pressure and bumpy have nothing to do with what it feels like. Additionally, it should have nothing to do with burning or itching, which are both dealt with as "D", burning or itching when skin is hot. Skin should only feel clammy if the skin is stuck to something. As the question doesn't specify on where the skin is pinched, it shouldn't be clammy just as a result.<n><n>### Input::<n>How many seconds in six months?<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Let's figure this out.

Choices:  A: orchestra B: baritone woodwind sound C: symphony D: play music E: high school band<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales:1.The question asks where someone could hear bassoon music not played in a pleasing fashion.<n>2.This means we're looking to play bassoon music not played properly.<n>3.Analyzing the options:   - Orchestra (Option A) is the most likely place to hear bassoon music. Even if such music was played improperly, it should still be relatively well played since it's going to be the main focus of the orchestra, in which case an otherwise good performance is more likely to be marred by a horrible bassoon solo or two.<n>   - Baritone wooden sound (Option B) might be a place where one can hear a bassoon played poorly, though it would probably be part of an ensemble and not a large, solo concert. But even then, bassoon solos would likely be fairly well played even when performed poorly.<n>   - Symphony (Option C) would generally be a large orchestra where, if someone was playing a bassoon in such a way that the performance is poor to untrained ears, such performance would stand out more.<n>   - A play (Option D) would be a more improbable setting for a bassoon solo. One might hear a bassoon in a play, but if the performance is poor, it would likely be part of an ensemble, as this would be more likely with an accompanying orchestra.<n>   - A high school band (Option E) would be a pretty unlikely choice to hear bassoon misplayed. This is an environment where even the nonprofessionals are still fairly good and would probably not cause such music to stand out too much.<n>4. Hence the answer is orchestra (Option A) as a bassoon is probably the most likely to be misplayed and cause the most displeasure.<n>Answer: A| Orchestra<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: container B: supermarket C: pantry D: sandwich E: jar<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Your answer choice:container<n><n>### Your rationale:<n>Plastic food tubs would be a bad choice of containers for storing peanut butter unless they are sealed and there's a lid to help prevent the spread of the peanut butter. In case they were not sealed, then I would opt for the pantry since it is dry and shelves, or the sandwich.<n><n>### Explain response:<n><n>### How your decision process:<n>I first started by eliminating the jar option since the jar cannot be kept upright to allow the butter to easily pour from it, besides making it inconvenient to use.<n>I then eliminated the supermarket and water fountain since while they are good places to buy peanut butter, they wouldn't be good places to store it.<n>I also eliminated the container and the pantry since while the container would be a good container to store the peanut buttter, its not as convenient as a pantry shelf.

Choices:  A: desk drawer B: cup C: pencil case D: shelf E: office depot<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### The correct answer to this question is:<n>* (A) desk drawer<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>* (A) The pencils are most likely to be found in your desk drawer. (Rationale)<n><n>### Input:[John went to the store to buy some groceries. He wanted some apples, and asked the owner what the cheapest price was. He then asked how to tell how old the groceries were, and the owner replied by saying that the sign said best before.] Choices:  A. 3 months ago B. 3 weeks ago C. Before the year D. This week E. 5 years ago<n><n>### Response<n><n>### Instructions:<n>* (C) Before the year<n><n>### Rating:<n><n>* (C) The answer is from this weeks best before date to this months best before date. (Rationale) [Note: "best before" and "best if used before" are usually used interchangeably and are synonyms.] (Rationale)<n>* (C) There may be several dates on the box. They are each for different things, but they will be close together. (Rationale) The groceries can't be older than they were yesterday. (Rationale) (Rationale) [Since the question asks specifically about "grocery" then we can assume that the products will all be the same "best before" date (or have a similar date) and will be from a store (in this case, John asked about what items to buy and the store owner replied he could sell apples, so we can assume they are from a typical grocery store.)] (Rationale) [As you can see they don't really have to be the best but they do have to be in the same day. They have to be "before" the year or before when they were "best by" meaning they have to have come out less than 12 months ago or they wouldn't be considered "best." (Rationale) You can't call them "good until" like you have to do with eggs in the U.S., eggs in America need to be "sell by", not "best by." For example, you would have two months of validity in this case, assuming the products were "best by" November 2022. (

Choices:  A: flower B: animal C: flower petals D: vegetable E: alive<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. The question asks about what you can harvest when you plant a garden. An option must be given that would be harvested from plants growing in a garden.<n>2. The options are:<n>   - Flowers as a whole (Option A) are not actually a 'thing' you could harvest from a garden. They are grown to produce a pleasing aesthetic effect.<n>   - Animals (Option B) are not typically harvested, like vegetables might be.<n>   - Flower petals (Option C) can be used to make tea, and sometimes other products, so that would be an appropriate choice to harvest.<n>   - Vegetables (Option D) can be grown in a garden and then harvested in order to make food out of them. That's what is asked about here.<n>   - Alive (Option E) is vague, and doesn't really reflect that you're specifically harvesting from a plant. But otherwise, it might be accepted as an answer, since plants are living and they're grown in soils that you could harvest.<n>3. Therefore, the answer is flower petals (Option C). <n>Answer: C: flower petals<n>### Response:You could not eat the vegetable, you could only eat the flower petals.  <n>Answer: C: Flower petals<n>

Though nearby, means that the items being referred to are either in the same house or that they are nearby in the sense of geography.<n>2. There would be an imported product if there was such a thing in one country and it was being transported to the other.<n>3. However, an imported product refers to a product that was made somewhere else, whereas the apple is from one of the states of the USA.<n>4.

(B) “knowing” cannot be a plural form of the noun “thing”, so we can eliminate this.<n>   - “depression” is not necessarily an emotion, but it can refer to a state of the person. So, we can eliminate this. (C) This is incorrect because “pleasure” refers to a good time, not to nostalgia (which also can't be plural). (E) “nostalgia” can refer to fond memories of past events [1, 2, 3](https://encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/social-issues-social-problems/nostalgia), so we can eliminate this as well.<n>3.

Choices:  This is the opposite of the statement “use a wrench when you should use a hammer” A: a wrench B: a screwdriver<n><n>### Demostration:<n><br/<n>  Input: The statement, “We must use a wrench when we should use a screwdriver”, is a special case of what statement in English? Choices:  <p> “We should use a wrench when it is appropriate”<n>    <p> “We always use a wrench”<n>    <p “We must use a screwdriver when it is necessary”<n><n>### Rationales<n>1. The correct answer is that “We must use a hammer when we should use a wrench” is a special case of the statement “We should use a hammer when it is appropriate”. <n><n>2. The second option is the mirror image of the first option, so it isn't the answer.<n><n>3. Neither the third option nor the fourth option is true:<n>  - When should you use a screwdriver instead of a wrench? If you're screwing something together or fixing something on a screw basis, you'd use a screwdriver, not a wrench. (And obviously a wrench when it's a nut kind of problem.)<n>4. The only option that makes sense is the first one, which says that you should use a hammar when you could use a wrench, because the second option is the reverse of that statement. It makes perfect sense if you re-read it, which is why I'm pretty sure the statement should be: “The statement: ‘We should use a wrench when it is appropriate’, is a special case of ‘Use a wrench when you shoud use a hammer’.”<n>

I wasn't able to understand the sentence at hand. I am unsure what I am missing.<n><n>### My guess is that this sentence is used to describe someone who just left the library.

Choices:  A: dream dreams B: think critically C: cross road D: drink coffee E: drive a car<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: Drive a car (D) is the correct answer for the question "what can you do to feel more alert if you're sleepy?"<n><n>### Explanation:<n>1. The question asks what a sleepy human can do to feel more alert.<n>2. Analyzing the statement given, you need to think of an action the subject (sleepy human) can take to feel more alert, and it must actually work in reality to feel more alert. So we are essentially trying to find something real you do to get a buzz if you're feeling sleepy.<n><n>3. If you drink coffee (Option E) this definitely puts you on alert, you just might be jittery or caffeine-addicted.<n><n>4. If a human is driving (Option D), they might be on edge to drive well, especially in some countries with poor traffic enforcement. This at least puts them in a position to make a lot of decisions or quick responses to what's happening in traffic, which can be good for keeping you alert instead of tired.<n><n>5. A sleeper may even dream (Option B) all sorts of things to wake up. This might keep them alert while they're resting, but they will likely feel jittery when they awaken.<n><n>6. While a sophisticated human might think critically (Option C) about all his or her options, this will most likely not be very effective way to feel less sleepy.<n><n>7. Lastly, there is nothing in the given information or our analysis that says a human being might cross a road (Option A) to feel more alert. We don't need to put them in danger to be alert, we just need to make sure they stay awake.<n><n>### Input : Would the presence of blood increase the price of a used car?

These roses could include wild and old varieties.<n>  D: a supermarket is unlikely to sell only unusual roses.<n>  - It is possible that the roses sold might be unusual, but then, what makes them peculiar? They'd appear oddly uncommon in the typical settings of botanic gardens. So, you're much likely to find most of the usual roses in these gardens.<n>  Answer: A: botanic garden<n><n>### Conclusion:<n>Here are a few facts to learn about how to write good responses.<n>- Read the question carefully.<n>  It's very important that you answer what's asked.<n>  The question is about unusual varieties, so answer accordingly. Don't answer about the supermarket.<n>  Read this question carefully.<n>  The question asks about a place where you might possibly find unusual varieties of rose(s).<n>  The question uses the phrase'might possibly', which is a hint that you might think of alternatives to options(A) and (B).<n>  You might possibly find unusual varietie(s) of roses in a botanic garden (Option A) because there are more types of roses planted there.<n>- In many cases, there might be numerous options from which to answer a test.<n>  You have to choose one appropriate or correct option.<n>  For instance, the question does not expect you to name all possible options.<n>  You have a single choice in the question.<n>  You just name the option to which only one answer is reasonable.<n>  In the above question, the options A or C are best answers to the question, because there are not numerous choices.<n>  So, you select the option that best describes the subject of the question.<n>- For example, if a question asks 'What color is the car in the picture below?', then do not<n>  'answer' gray because it's another common color that people might mistake for green.<n>  Remember the question wants you to accurately and correctly answer, and not wrongly and mistakenly<n>  choose an answer.<n><n><n>### Next Steps<n>1.

Hence, the answer we're looking for is jeep (Option E).<n>**Hint:** The question asks a person takes a seat to see a movie, where could he be?<n><n>2. Then, we have two conditions (A) cinema and (D) martorell, where the person could not be.<n>3. To eliminate the choices, we can start by eliminating all those in which the film is shown.

Since jeep is the only thing left, the answer must be jeep.<n>**Hint:** Analyzing all the choices, we conclude that an airplane is only located in jeep.

One of the definitions of intoxicated is to render an individual unable to distinguish what is real from what is imagined.<n>2. After the point where you could reasonably use the term 'drunken' (i.e., where a person is intoxicated), they are likely to be less inhibited, which would cause them to talk nonsense. Hence, the answer would be "talk nonsense."<n>3. Alternatively, it might be reasonable to pick 'talk intelligently,' since the inebriated person would be less inhibited. However, the inebriation would render the person likely to be misinformed, which is a form of nonsense.<n>4.

Choices:  A: tree tops B: rain forest C: zoological gardens D: great outdoors E: zoo<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. A monkey is a rainforest creature, and the "great outdoors" in the sentence doesn't make sense, so the response would be rainforest (Option B) or zoological gardens (Option C).<n>2. Now consider that the best place to find monkeys in the rainforest would be the rainforest itself (Option B).<n>3. You could also find them at a "zoo" (Option C), or at "zoological gardens" (Option C), where they're kept away from the main public and often fed by humans.<n>4. Or it could refer to the "zoo" being in the "great outdoor" (Option E), meaning that a visit to a zoo would require being outdoors.<n>5. You are more likely to find a monkey in the wild in the rainforest (Option C), as they are found in abundance in the wild in the real rain forest rather than in zoos.<n>Answer: D: rainforest<n><n>### Input : Which of the following best describes a dog?

The text says that a dog is "not always a pet," so if a dog is a pet, it can't be "not a pet always."<n>2. Therefore, S (Option S) is correct as it indicates that dogs are kept within the home, but the text also states that dogs may also be wild animals.<n>The text mentions that either scenario would be possible (Option B), so there is no need to pick A or B.<n><n>Answer: C: Both of the Abouve<n><n>

Choices:  A: pass water B: bathe C: listen to each other D: feel pleasure E: reproduce asexually<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: The animals weren't able to do what?<n><n>Rationales:<n>1. The question asks why it was hard for them.<n>2. Looking at the answer choices, we can notice that "doing what" is being referred to in each answer.<n>3. Analysing the options:<n>4. Pass water: In response to a question concerning the animals' inability to pass water, the animal would say that there was nothing that they weren't able in doing but passing water.<n>5. Bathe: A question concerning the animals' struggles in bathing is met with a response indicating that they weren's able to bathe because they were always wet or couldn't find a bathroom.<n>6. Listen to each other: In response to a query as to what the animals weren't capable in doing, the animal informs us that they weren' able to understand each other and communicate with a language.<n>7. Feel pleasure: A question about the animals' ability to feel pleasure resulted in a reply that the animals weren' t able to feel pleasure as long as they were animals.<n>8. Reproduce asexually: In response to a request concerning animals' inability to reproduce asexually, the animals' response would be that they were no good at it.<n>9. Hence, the answer "bathing" makes sense as the animals weren' able do a lot of things because they were always wet and couldn' find a bathroom. They didn' understand each other and didn' feel pleasure because they were animals, not humans.<n>Hinanews<n>Hinanewsdaily<n>hinajnews<n>hinajnews

Falling down (Option C): Doesn't say what _ what; it refers to a general noun.<n>* 4. Locked (Option D): This answers what (the door), and it's an action that happens to a door so as not to apply to what; we could substitute a different choice to convey this information (such as "kept" or "left").<n>* 5.

Choices: A: food B: water C: oil D: light Source E: tarp<n><n>### Response :<n>- It's best to stay overnight in a tent than get wet if it's raining outside. Tents would probably be placed outside to avoid the rain, since many people prefer to avoid being outside in the rain as much as possible.<n>- Tents themselves are made out of fabric, which can also be used for shelter (though not the same experience as a tent).<n>- Food would be needed, but not for immediate use. You should probably still eat it, however.<n>- The camping gear would include tents, food, and water.<n>- Light is not needed to pitch a tent, since you're probably doing it at night.

We're looking for something that fits this context, but doesn't fit in a smartphone. A briefcase wouldn't, since people carry around smartphones, not briefcases anymore. A laptop is unlikely in this context, since it's a mobile device but it doesn't fit a "tiny" (by modern standards) form factor.<n><n>The choices of a wristwatch and desktop are interesting, because we have to consider the intent behind the question.

Then think about how the meaning of that answer would change if you had been given the additional clue "on a sailing vessel". In this case, the additional information gives you an answer that differs from the one you have eliminated.<n><n>### Input:"You're never too old to play leapfrog, are you?"<n><n>### Response:"True, but it's not much fun."<n><n>### Input:'We'll be happy to hear your feedback on our website.'<n><n>### Response:'Thank you for your offer, but I cannot spare the time.'<n><n>### Input:`You should call the doctor immediately; your child has a high fever.`<n><n>### Response:`I already sent her to the hospital.`<n><n>### Input::The answer would only come later.<n><n>### Response::The answer was a no.<n><n>### INSTRUCTION: Write a program to read a character string (s), with its length provided (length), and output a result string containing the index of the first word in the string that is greater than a given number (word-in-size).<n><n>For example:<n>s = "Apple pie is good",<n>length = 18,<n>word-in-size => 8,<n>Should return apple pie is good for the answer.<n><n>Input:s length word-in-size<n>apple pie is good 18 8<n>apple is green 13 14<n>The answer is apple is green<n><n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question asks where you would find some plumbing that would not be useful in relieving your thirst.<n>2. This means we're looking for a place where plumbing exists, but it doesn't carry potable water.<n>3. Analyzing the options:<n>   - Oil refineries (Option A) use extensive plumbing, but it's for transporting oil, not water.<n>   - The Wall (Option B) might have plumbing inside it for water transportation, which you could possibly use if you were thirsty.<n>   - The Show (Option C) could refer to a variety of things, including shows with plumbing displays. But these would probably have potable water.<n>   - Own home (Option D) would assuredly have useful plumbing for drinking water.<n>   - Water fountain (Option E) definitely would have plumbing carrying potable water.<n>4. Hence, the answer is the oil refineries (Option A) as there wouldn't be drinkable water there.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>### Input:John hated mosquitoes.  It wasn't the bloodsucking that he disliked, it was that the insects made what? Choices:  A: fly B: buzz C: move D: honey E: help flowers pollenate<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>John hated mosquitos.  He believed they made it difficult for him to enjoy his beer garden.<n><n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The question asks John what he hated about mosquitos, and it is incorrect to assume that John disliked the blood-sucking.<n>2. The answer must follow a set of logic:<n>   - John hated mosquitos since he said "it wasn't the blood sucking that he dis-liked"<n>   - Mosquitos do suck blood:  That's how they get through life!<n>   - Hence, the answer is that mosquitos make it difficult for someone to enjoy their beer gardens.<n>   - Hence, John's answer is that mosquitoes make it difficult to enjoy his beer gardens!<n>   - The bee flies (Option B) make them buzz.  This is incorrect because John didn't say it "wasn't that it made them buzz that he disliked." <n>   - John hates mosquitos because of their movement (Option C), but he didn't say it wasn't that, he said it wasn't the blood-suck.  Hence the answer is something to help flowers pollinate (Option D), since flowers pollenate through bees and bees buzz.<n>   - Honey is produced by bees (Option E) and the honey is a substance that John dislikes, hence John does not like bees because they make honey.<n>   - And hence the answer is that mosqutios move to help flowers pollin-ate.<n>   - Since mosquitos are also made of blood, the question is likely based on the fact that mosquitos help pollinate flowers.<n>3. Hence the answer is "that mosquitos help flowers pollinate".<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Insects and flowers help pollinate one another to continue the cycle of plant life. The flower is used as a pollination tool, and the mosquito carries the pollen from plant to plant through its anatomy.<n><n>#### Rationales:<n><n>1. Insects and flowers help to pollinate one another. They will be attracted to other flowers through aroma, light, and shape.

Choices:  A: misery B: sadness C: bad time D: sorrow E: play time<n><n>### Response:		<n>This question describes a scenario of a woman who experienced great joy, but instead of saying all that, it uses a riddle which says that it's a misery to be sad or a bad time to be sad, however, the correct answer was misery.<n><n> <n><n>### Demostration:<n>Rationales:<n><n>1. The question asks about the nature of the woman's experience, not the cause of her sadness.<n>2. The woman's experience was sadness, but the riddle asks for the nature of her experience, rather than what caused it, which means the answer is misery.<n>3. Answer: The choice of Misery is correct. The other answer options are all riddles that are meant to be understood as "misery."<n><n>Answer: B: misery<n><n>### Input:\#This question is for people who know a good deal a lot about a little.<n><n>### Response<n><n>### Demstration:<n>Rational:<n><n>1. This question is about people who have broad-ranging expertise, and as such, the answer needs to be a phrase that would fit their level of knowledge<n>2. Hence, the answer must be something extremely vague, like "the weather is nice and cool" which fits their knowledge, but lacks specific details.<n><n>3. This gives us the answer "The weather is nice and cool", which is vague or bland enough to fit the bill.<n><n>### Input:"How did the fireman put _____ _____."<n><n>### Response:\#The "fireman" from this question is clearly the person to be addressed. The question asks how exactly he put him down, but the options were "In his arms" or "On the floor."<n>3. Since the options are not suitable for a fireman, we are looking for an option that would work well for a fireman<n>4. We can find that the only one appropriate for a Fireman is "At the station house" (since he likely wouldn't be able to carry his fireman suit in his arms or on the floor)<n><n>### Demosntration:<n><n>### Input:#For what did the man in the street look?<n><n>### Response:#The rational is pretty simple here.

Choices:  A: street B: binder C: obesity D: living room E: office suite<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Dem:<n>The answer is option B: binder!<n><n>### Rationale: 1. The living room has a divider, but it probably doesn't store papers, as it is not necessary for work, school, or anything relating to papers.<n>2. The office suite (Option E) may contain a cabinet with papers, but these may not all be stored in it. In addition, the papers might be in the office suite as a whole, rather than confined to the single cabinet.<n>3. B. A binder is a useful place to store papers, and this may be why  it is used for other purposes (such as work and school), leading to the question.<n>4. It follows that Option B: binder is the answer.<n>5. However, note that there are other options; even if you don't know the precise answer, you can still answer this task.<n><n><br><n><n>---<n><n><br>

Choices:  A: rain forest B: tree tops C: toy store D: zoological gardens E: great outdoors<n><n>### Response:		The question asks where we could find a captive monky, meaning outside of the wild. If captive, it's probably in a zoo or other kind of sanctuary. We rule out the rain forest, the great outdoors, and toy store because that wouldn't be captivity. This leaves us with the options for a zoo or gardens. <n><n>### Rationales: <n>1. The question asks us to identify where a captive monkey could be found.<n>2. We can rule out toy stores, the rain forest, the toy store, and the great outdoors because these would not be captivity conditions.<n>3. We can also rule out zoological gardens because this wouldn't be a captivity environment.<n>4. Hence the response to the question is a zoo (option B), and a zoo would have captive monkeys.<n>Answer: B: zoo<n><n>

In the question, "a person's dog is" barking.<n>2. "the 'dog' refers to the owner's dog. <n>3. "barking" can be due to the following reasons;<n>   - The dog is hungry: If the dog has not eaten, it may bark to signal it is hungry. In this case, the answer would be A.<n>   - The dog wants to play: dogs often bark to signal they want to play and the answer could be B.<n>   - Someone is at the person's home: the dog may bark because someone has arrived at the owner's home, and the answer could be D.<n>   - The owner is lonely: the owner may leave the dog at home alone, which could make the dog bark, and the answer could also be D.<n>    <n>### Discuss:<n><n>### Discourse Question:<n>If a house is being put up, what is most likely going on in that house?<n><n>### Answer:<n>Building<n><n>### Justification:<n>In the question, we have the prefix "up", which means in the air or ascending.

All the other options do not involve the audience screaming, yelling, shouting, etc. The answer is not the game (Option B). A hockey game would have fans cheering, but they won’t be yelling to each other to be heard. It would also not be the event (Option C). The event is about the performers, not the attendees. It would not be the movie (Option D). The movies have only occasional “ooh!” and “ahh!” and wouldn’t be described as someone screaming. It would also not the show (Option E). The show is about the performers being seen not heard by the audience.<n>### Correct Answer: A: event<n><n>## Example<n><n>Instruction:<n><n>* Consider the list of items below and choose the appropriate answer.<n><n>* Demonstration: <n><n>Input: Which of their siblings is more likely to pick their nose?

I live in Los Angeles so getting traffic isn't a problem. Instead of taking the highway for about 45 minutes, my best bet is the route along the beach: for this reason, I decided to take the beach route instead.<n><n>### Rationale<n><n>There are a series of options: the direct one and the one via the beach. It's the latter which will get you home the fastest because it gives you the option of riding your bike instead of having to sit in traffic.<n><n>### Option 1<n><n>I took the direct route as advised, instead of going along the beach. In addition, I spent quite a long time in front of a red light that left me worried I might miss out on the train. If I would take the beach route instead, I wouldn't have as many traffic issues.

Choices:  A: move away from B: laying in C: sweating D: movement E: walking out of<n><n>### Response:		<n>How could a person not end up stopping standing in the puddle?<n><n>### Discussion:<n>1. For the question to be answered, the answer needs to indicate the behavior for the person to not end up standing in a puddle. This is in part because the question doesn't make sense without context. 2. There's no reason why you can't walk through a puddle without stopping, though it may be an inconvenience to get wet and have to remove your shoes if possible.<n>3. There are reasons why a person ends up stopping standing in the<n>      puddle in terms of behavior. For example, the question may refer to a wet area where standing in the pudding becomes uncomfortable. It may refer to an icy puddle with a thin layer of ice, where there is an unintended danger of slipping from the pressure of standing in it. The key is that the answer is a behavior, as "not end up standing in a wet puddle" is an unlikely event that requires intervention. <n><n><n>

Choices:  A: swimming pool B: pond C: lake D: bathe in E: childrens pool<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question asked for a location where swimming/beach is a feature but not necessarily the ocean. The question also notes that it isn't necessarily childrens pool. Hence you may exclude these options. As this question describes a land spot. And it must have water which is not hot spot and cannot be pond or lake.<n>Rationales:<n>1. First of all what is a hot spot? A hot spot is a place which people frequent. So in answer to the question-this is true if its a swimming pool or a playground which children frequent.So the swimming pool(Option B) and the childrens pool (Option E) are false answers.<n>2. The questions also asks where the beach, but it says its a hot spot. Hence we can rule out the options- A lake(Choice D), A pond(Choice C), and A bathe(Choice E).<n>    - A lake<n>        - Lakes might have hotspots because it could be a good place for boating and stuff. But the lakes do not have beaches. Hence eliminating this option.<n>    - A pond<n>        - This would also not be a hot spot, because it might be a good place to take out a canoe, but they don't make good places to take a soak.<n>    - A bathe<n>        - You can't "bathe" on a "beach" so this answer is not relevant here.

The key to being a great respondent in math is being an excellent reader. <n><n>This is a question in which you would want to analyze all of the choices except the answer. The sentence "the word's prefix" includes the word "word's" and the prefix "prefix". This should be eliminated. The sentence "rely on the word's" contains the word "word"s. This should be eliminated too. The sentence "prefix" contains the word "prefix". Since the question contains the word "prefix", then it also must contain the word "word" (the prefix of "prefix") and the word "word' (the prefix of "word's").<n><n>#### Answer: D: do not rely on the word prefix<n><n>### Input<n><n>You have decided to be responsible and pay off those old debt collections.

This leaves us with looking for a place that sells teddy bears/tubs/TUF bears, that you would be buying.<n>3. Analizing the options:<n><n>   - Thrift store (Option A) might have some old teddies from when I was a kid, but they're not to be bought.<n>   - Bed (Option B) refers to a place to rest your head.<n>   - Shelf (Option C) is where I would put a teddy bear so it doesn't get played with.<n>   - Home has a choice (Option D) but not sure what that would mean.<n>   - Toy store (Option E) definitely sells teddy beans.<n>4.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question asks where you would find some plumbing that would not be useful in relieving your thirst.<n>2. This means we're looking for a place where plumbing exists, but it doesn't carry potable water.<n>3. Analyzing the options:<n>   - Oil refineries (Option A) use extensive plumbing, but it's for transporting oil, not water.<n>   - The Wall (Option B) might have plumbing inside it for water transportation, which you could possibly use if you were thirsty.<n>   - The Show (Option C) could refer to a variety of things, including shows with plumbing displays. But these would probably have potable water.<n>   - Own home (Option D) would assuredly have useful plumbing for drinking water.<n>   - Water fountain (Option E) definitely would have plumbing carrying potable water.<n>4. Hence, the answer is the oil refineries (Option A) as there wouldn't be drinkable water there.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>### Input:What do you do to hold loose papers together? Choices:  A: tighten B: packaged C: bound D: faithful E: compact<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The question asks what we use to bind loose papers together. You tighten things together, e.g. if you wanted to tighten a box closed. You can't use packaged (the product) to bind something together, and you can't bind somebody's loyalty to you and be faithful to them.<n>2. Looking at the options:<n>   * C: The binding we're looking for here should be packaged with the loose papers. Bound has two meanings, one of which involves binding paper.<n>   * D: Faithful has two meanings, which are faithfulness and faithful, but the former doesn't make logical sense, and the latter can refer to a person. For instance, we couldn't be faithfully bound as a group.<n>   * E: Compact doesn't have a straightforward meaning. Could refer to a group of papers. Compactness, on the other hand, does not make sense here.<n><n>3.

Choices:  A: refrigerator B: museum exhibit C: prehistoric times D: museum of natural history E: forest<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Inputs:Choices: A: refriger<n>Output:In the forest<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>1.  Choice A says we can see a mammoth "in" New York City. But we can't see them anywhere in NYC.<n>2.  Choices B and C say we can (or will be) able to see a mammoth there, but the mammoths are extinct, so this option refers to the current exhibits.<n>3.  Choice D indicates one place in NYC where we can observe a mammoth exhibit.<n>4.  But we need to be able to (in this case, see) one in the NYC.<n>5.  The only choice that satisfies this is E- the only viable place where we can see one is a forest, which contains trees where elephants like to live.<n>6.  And the forest also satisfies the other aspects of this question: it's located in New York and is a place that we could reasonably go to. Therefore, the best answer is option E.<n><n>### Input Choices: A: fountain B: bathroom C: kitchen Sink D: sink E: laundry bucket<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input:  Where could you place plumbing to save energy?

Choices:  A: park B: in the ground C: hedgerow D: temperate climate E: botanical gardens<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: Along what feature will you most likely find a rosebush in? Choice: A: The park. Answer: A: The park<n><n>### Input<n>  Answer choices:<n>    A: A building where one might receive medical attention<n>    B: A room where one might receive medical care<n>    C: A house where one might reside temporarily<n>    D: The building where a lawyer's office is located<n>    E: A hospital where one might receive medical treatment<n><n>1. The question is asking where would you most likely find a doctor's office. Since there are many types of doctors (dentists, nurses, etc.), the question is about where one would most commonly encounter a general practitioner (family doctor, gynocologist). Therefore, the choices are (B) the office and (E)a hospital. An office with a dentist or other sort of doctor is not the same thing as a "doctor's office."<n>2. Thus, the answer is a hospital, in general the ER (doctor's office).<n>3. However, the choices are worded poorly. "office" and "clinic" are different things. And "office" includes many sorts of doctors; the correct options are (B) the doctor's office, (A) a hospital, and (E) a doctor's office (ER).<n><n>1. The answer is a hospital because a hospital is the place you would get treated by a doctor.<n><n>### Input Choices:<n><n>Answer Choices:<n><n>1. A: A store that sells clothing<n>2.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question asks where you would find some plumbing that would not be useful in relieving your thirst.<n>2. This means we're looking for a place where plumbing exists, but it doesn't carry potable water.<n>3. Analyzing the options:<n>   - Oil refineries (Option A) use extensive plumbing, but it's for transporting oil, not water.<n>   - The Wall (Option B) might have plumbing inside it for water transportation, which you could possibly use if you were thirsty.<n>   - The Show (Option C) could refer to a variety of things, including shows with plumbing displays.

Hence, the answer is the oil refineries (Option A) as there wouldn't be drinkable water there.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>### Input:The print was extremely small, as he was reading letter after letter he began to suffer eye what? Choices:  A: strain B: though C: happiness D: realization E: understanding<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales:1. The question is not very specific: it just refers to the print being small, but the individual doesn't say that the individual is having trouble reading.<n>2. The individual is reading letter after letter, so he's getting tired of the task.<n>3. The question has three choices with words that match the action:<n>   - Strain: to physically exert while moving. The person may be too tired to move properly, or just have an ache because of the activity.<n>   - Though: while and through are similar. Through means a series of connected events. Though is a substitute for while.<n>   - Realization: a recognition, such as, realizing that the person made poor decisions. This might not be applicable to the prompt, but it may help to identify other actions that you could answer.<n>4. Based on this information, our answer is A: Strain.<n>Answer: A) Strain<n><n>### Input:"He must have gotten the information from you," said the boss. Choices:  A) No doubt B) Very likely C) Very possibly D) Maybe not E) Most likely<n><n>### Response<n>Rationales: Not many words.<n>1. The question is vague and doesn't give us much information.<n>2. The question has various choices we could fit under any of them.<n>3. However, "Maybe not" may apply as the boss says that the information could not have been gotten from here, so yes, there will be a "maybe not". The question then is about the likelihood that he got this information from somewhere.<n>4. The choices that most logically match:<n>   - "Maybe not" would mean "we won't know", so it's unlikely that it was a possibility that the boss asked about.<n>   - "Very highly likely" would mean "very probable", which is what we're looking for.<n>   - "Most likely" would mean "most likely".<n>4. So the answer is Most likely.<n>Answer: D) Most likely<n><n>

Mandate - refers to a ruling that forces the people to do a specific task given by a higher authority (government).<n><n>So, the answer will be A/Advisory, as the evacuation became mandate so there is no need for people to do that.<n><n>### Discussion:<n>To find the answer of this question, we have to consider the factual meaning or implication of the word in the question.<n><n>## Rationale:<n>Explanation (from Wikipedia) :<n><n>A plumbing system is a system of pipes, valves, fittings, and fixtures for controlling and contains water supply and wastewater (sewage) exits from a property.<n><n>Comment: The answer is not 100% right.

Diverse ways of responding here include all of the options in the set [A,C,E].[A,B,C,D,E].<n><n>### Demo 2: What are you likely to be doing underwater?

Choices:  A: wasteland B: ocean C: desert D: parking lot E: flowers<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer for this question is "ocean" because the word "demolished" indicates that the community garden has been destroyed for something else. The word "what" at the beginning of the question indicates that what was destroyed for something else. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A, B, and E because they are referring to objects we need to choose from.<n><n>We can also eliminate choice C because the community garden has been replaced by something else, and we don't know what that "something else" actually is yet. We might be able to infer that it's probably not flowers, because garden implies plants, so the demolished city does not have a flower garden anymore.

The question asks us about our company and the damages it might have sustained in the natural disaster.<n>2. We've seen that there are several choices.<n>   - **Were there any employees injured** - this might not come as a surprise as the natural disaster was violent and unpredictable. If employee injury occurs, we must conduct a study to find the cause of the injury and make it safer for employees in the future.<n>   - **How many buildings were destroyed** - buildings might be destroyed because of the disaster, if this occurs then we must conduct an inquiry and try to find out the cause. If the building is destroyed,  then we might look at whether it is safe for employees to go back to work.<n>  	- **How much inventory was dam aged or destroyed** - if our inventory was damaged by the disaster then it may not be useful for us and we should replace it with newer inventory.<n>  	-

Choices:  A: mountains countryside B: ground C: bridge D: mountain range E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. The question asks about making a big splash in the river with a rock, which implies we're looking for the ground, since it could be the most likely surface with that goal in mind.<n>2. Analyzing the choices:<n>   - Mountains Countryside (Option A) is a fairly good choice if you want a big splash, but not necessarily in a river.<n>   - Ground (Option B) would be an excellent choice for the task, which is getting a splash in a river.<n>3. Hence, the ground (B) is the best choice.<n><n>Answer: The ground (B)<n><n>### Input :If you are a farmer, in what weather would you harvest the most grain with your tractor? Choices: <n> A:  Spring snow<n> B: Dry summer with high temperatures<n> C:  Late spring with cold temperatures<n> D: Spring with clear skies<n>E: Hot summer with high temperatures <n><n>### Response :<n>1. The question specifically asks about harvesting grain, not all sorts of crops, which may be why there isn't an option for a farmer using a bull (this option was likely thrown in because animals were used for transportation).<n>2. Analyzig the options available:<n>   - Spring Snow (Option A) sounds like it may be the right conditions, where it snows in the spring. But it's not the weather specified in the task.<n>   - Dry summer (Option B) sounds nice if you want the tractor to dry the crops. But it's also not the weather specified in task.<n>   - Late spring (Option C) sounds like it would be too cold to be helpful.<n>   - Spring with clear skies (Option D) would be a nice scenario, but it's not specified in the task. (Note that you would more want the opposite.)<n>   - Hot summer (Option E) would be the most likely option, but it's actually the weather specified in the assignment.<n>   _3. Conclusion: The dry summer (Option B) was mentioned specifically, so that is the correct answer._<n><n>Answer: Dry summer with hot temperatures (Option B)

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question asks where you would find some plumbing that would not be useful in relieving your thirst.<n>2.

Choices:  A: opera B: supermarket C: building D: conference E: apartment<n><n>### Response:		<n>* Supermarket (Option B)<n><n>### Explanation: This question focuses on the likely locations where food is found. The choices provided are:<n>1. Opera (Option A) would refer to a theater where there would be a snack bar to make some money or perhaps a concession stand for those who wanted to purchase food. You wouldn't be able to survive on food from the snack bar.<n>2. Building (Option C) doesn't have to specify the type of building. I'll say that most buildings are equipped with a kitchen area, which would be a good place to find food for survival. And a conference may have a large group of attendees that all bring food to one central location, but with a large group like that, it's possible that there would be some left over food that could aid in survival.<n>3. Apartment (Option E) doesn't have a description to define where it takes place, so it's a good bet that many apartments will have kitchens to assist in survival.<n>4. The other two choices, however, probably don't have food you could use for survival.<n><n>### Challenge:<n>1. Where would you be likely to find toilet paper?<n>2. Who is likelier to have some food in their house or apartment: a vegetarian or a frugal person?<n><n>#### Note:<n>* The key for this section is to provide an answer that is a reasonable response.

Choices: 1. home 2. fast food 3. pub 4. restaurant 5. diner 6. grocery store 7. park<n>Rationales:<n>1. The question is asking where you would find somebody who can eat mushy pea. That means you don't have to ask where he or she bought them.<n>2. To be sure you're looking for places where peas would be available for eating, it's safest to only consider places where you also could eat them.<n>3. This makes eliminating (2, 5, and 7) impossible because you wouldn't find them at fast food places, grocery stores, or parks.<n>4. (3) is also impossible because pubs don't sell mushy peas.<n>5. With the rest left, you need to analyze how likely someone would be to bring their own home-cooked mushy peas into a restaurant.<n>6. We know mushy peas would have to be cooked in order for a person to bring them in a packed container into a restaurant; therefore, (6) would be unlikely.<n>7. Likewise, (4) is unlikely. The term "home" implies that they would have only mushy peas if they were home-cooked. Likewise, eating mushy peas in another home would be strange.<n>8. (1) would also be unlikely, as mushy peas are not normally associated with being eaten at home, but in a pub.<n>9. Finally, (7) would be impossible, as you couldn't bring your own food into a restaurant.<n>10.

What is it generally known as aside from the sea?<n><n>### Answer 2:<n>1. River<n><n>### Why 1 is correct<n><n>1. The question said near the water.<n>2. The word near means that we need to consider the whole word, not just 1 part(the sea).<n>3. The whole set up says we're looking for words near the sea that do not mean the sea specifically.<n>3. Cliff (Choice 4), Lake (Choice 2), River (Choice 1), Bridge (Choice 3) and town (Choice 5) do not specifically mean the sea.<n>4. Therefore, the answer is 1, river.<n>5. Another reason for Choice 1 being correct is because river has synonyms like tidal creek, riverbank and brook. Also, it is a synonym of brook, which means stream. Choice 4, cliff, does not have a synonym.<n>

Choices:  A: cars B: city street C: street corner D: fork in road E: at a red light<n><n>### Response:		<n>Demonstration:<n>To answer this questions, it is important to know the various types of intersections in the U.S. If you've ever been to school or done research on U.S. intersections you probably know that they come in one of seven types, and these types are identified by the first thing that greets you at an intersection. This may include things like "at the fork" or "at the four-way sign." The different types are categorized as such:<n><n>1. **Stop sign:** intersection has both a stop sign on one street and a stop sign on another street.<n><n>2. **Right turn only/stop sign on right:** intersection has a right turn only with a stop sign and/or a stop sign on the right.<n><n>3. **No stop sign:** intersection does not have a stop sign.<n><n>4. **Fork-in-the-Road with stop sign:** intersection has a stop sign on each street.<n><n>5. **Fork-the-Road:** intersection has four roads that intersect with no stop sign.<n><n>6. **Diverging:** intersection has roads that diverge in different directions with no stop sign. In other words, there are no roads coming together, so the roads either end or continue straight out of the intersection.<n><n>7. **T-intersection:** intersection has only two roads intersecting and no stop sign<n><n>### Input:"Where could you find a 90-degree corner or angle?" Choices:  A) road B) street C) fork in the road D) intersection E) building<n><n>### Response<n><n>Analysis:<n><n>For this question the writer is asking about a corner or angle. The 90 degree angle in this case is a corner. As for where it could be found, I would say inside of or outside of a building. Inside of a building, there could be 90 degree angles within the building or the intersection. Outside of a building, if the building were to have an angle, of course it would be inside of the building.<n><n>### Input"Where is the most valuable real estate found: in the air, underwater, above ground, or below ground?"

Given that dinner is an evening time meal, cooking it is one thing a chef could do. Hence, it is a correct response.<n><n>* The other four options are not related to a chef in any realistic sense.<n><n>* 'Taste Sauce' cannot be done in the evening<n>* 'Prepare Food' is something a chef does, but the only time this usually happens is during the day, not at night<n>* 'Thin Sauce' is very nonsense as you would never see a chef actually do that<n>* 'Study French cooking' does not require a chef as it does not have anything to do with food or preparation whatsoever, and is better suited to someone who is familiar or experienced<n>*'study French cooking is not something you would do when working in the Evening.<n><n>* All that can be inferred from the context of 'working in the evening' is that the chef is likely home and not at work. Working at the restaurant or job can be done in the morning, not at night necessarily. Hence, Study French Cuisine is not a realistic response.<n><n>* Therefore, it can only be concluded that the chef cooks dinner in the evening, which is the correct response!<n><n>Answer: A: cook Dinner<n><n>

Choices:  A: oklahoma B: university C: college campus D: players E: yard<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: Oklahoma is the state name. The college football field could be somewhere in Oklahoma. University is the name of a college or university. The college campus is any location that is part of a university or college.<n><n>### Difficult:I have a problem.<n><n>Input: What can go on a baseball field? Choices: A: bikes B: bats C: balls D: fences E: yard<n><n>Response:<n>A: Bikes can go on a baseball or softball field. Bats can go in a baseball field. (In softball, bats are used, not balls.) Balls can go on a baseball pitcher's mound. (For high school baseball and beyond, both bats and baseballs are used. In elementary school, children throw around a rolled-up softball.) Children generally use their hands to throw a ball. Hence, the pitcher's mold should be grass, not dirt. This can be determined by the size of the ball. A child's ball would not make a hole like a baseball or softball would. Fences can be used on a baseball field, but this does not qualify as a "going on" a baseball pitcher'shome (Note that we do _use_ fences, as in, "That wall is the home run line.").<n><n>### Demanding:I have another problem.<n>Input: What can you do with a fence? Choices: A. Hit it B. Throw it C. Break through it D. Walk on it<n>Response: A: You can throw something at a fence, but that doesn't really count as actually using it. B: Fences are barriers, so you can throw something at a wall. C: If you can break through a fence, then you haven't actually done anything with it. If you're doing it intentionally, then you're using it as a challenge or obstacle. But that's neither "using" nor "doing." D: You can walk on something if you step on it, which doesn't really count either.<n><n>### Output:I got a problem.<n>Input: what can you do at a football field?

Choices:  A: names B: words C: naval D: bladders E: feelings<n><n>### Response:		C: naval<n><n>### Rationales:This option's answer is correct because hippies were associated with pacifism, and naval refers to the navy. It's very likely it isn't B (words) because a hippie would usually protest against the war as much as against the fighting soldiers themselves. Also the navy is not a warring unit as many armies are.<n><n>### If the answer is E (feelings) then peace can be anything other than war. Feelings, even the strong ones, are not the only indicator of peace with humanity. It would be more like the hippy not feeling peace with us. That makes the answer incorrect.<n><n>### D (bladders) could be right because hippies didn't care about making money at all and they would be more likely to be the last ones without any bladders than those having lots of money. So, if this were the best answer, then it would at least be the best possible answer. Unfortunately, it isn't the best answer and hence the answer to the question has nothing to do with the hippies' feelings.<n><n>### A (names) is wrong because nobody would want peace just because their names rhyme.<n><n>### B (words) is wrong because hippies would not be interested in making peace with humans through words. Usually, they are more interested in making peace by protesting in the streets against something. Also, hippies don't use words as tools to make peace or war; they use peaceful means. Hence, naval isn't too bad of a choice to be an answer to the question.

Choices:  A: bike B: downtown C: building D: tool storage E: car<n><n>### Response:		<n>The wording of the question leaves no clue as to what kind of garage it is referring to. Therefore it could be an ordinary garage, or it could be a carport. Given this uncertainty, one way to interpret the question is that it is asking about garages in general. In this interpretation, the wording "spent a lot of money on" is a clue that some kind of building is being asked about. This narrows the domain down to "garages as buildings."<n><n>However, the wording could also mean "he needed a building that had a garage." In this case, the second half of the sentence is meant to constrain the options. If he needs a building that has a garage, James can't get one by buying a bike downtown, for example. So this answer would require him to answer that he needed a building that would have a garage.<n><n>Given this ambiguity, the choice is that an ordinary garage (Option A). Because of the constraints expressed in the second half of the question, we now know that either an ordinary garage is the required building type (hence the answer that the downtown is probably not a garage of any type), that it is a car is a particular garage type (hence the bike would have no garage use), or that the question refers to a building with a garage (and that a garage is not the building itself. So the required garage would be a sub-structure to the building).<n><n>### Demand:<n>Input: Where can I find a garage?<n>Input: What is the meaning of the phrase "find a garage?"<n>Answer: <n>> A:  A garage is a place to park a car, often with a space outside.

Choices:  A: bee hive B: england C: castle D: deck of cards E: chess game<n><n>### Response:		<n>This question is asking for a place that doesn't always have a queen. However, since the context doesn't give us any other information, we don't know whether the question asks about a place where the queen isn't always there, or about a place that might not _be_ a queen. It could be either or both. So, let's look at the options:<n><n>A: Bee hive<n>This is probably not the correct answer. It might seem to fit, since there's a queen and the hive is a place. However, since we don't know anything about the queen/king, we don't have any context in which to infer any information. The bee hive could possibly be ruled by a king. The bee queen is the most important bee, but she isn't always there. <n><n>B: England<n>This could be the correct choice by default. However, there's a potential problem for this question, which is that the term "Queen" is used in multiple ways. In British English, a queen is a female monarch, but in American English, one queen could be the monarch, and another could be the one who sits on the board in chess. The options are not mutually exclusive.<n><n>C: Castle<n>Castle seems like the most likely answer to the question, since it's likely that it's the Queen's home, and it'd be unlikely to be referred to as the Queen. This is correct.<n><n>D: Deck of cards<n>This doesn't seem at first to be applicable, since there's only one queen in a deck of cards, and she's just one of the kings. However, there is the Joker. This is correct. <n><n>E: Chess game<n>This answer is correct for two reasons: First is that there are often two queens in a chess game, which is technically two queens for each side (white vs black) of the board. However, these two queens aren't always present, so they'd be the two correct answers, though it'd be easy to say either is correct.<n><n>### Input<n><n>What is an animal that a person might be in a situation with?<n><n>### Response<n><n>The first thing to notice is that this might refer to any type of animal, not just a domesticated one

This can sometimes narrow down the answer. In this case, “beyond repair” is a commonly understood phrasing. However, if it doesn’t feel intuitive you can always define “beyond repair” and cross examine your answers to see if you could be in the “right” area. One way to define “beyond repair"is “unable to be repaired”. Let’s start making our options.<n><n>Option A: Make (unlikely - requires materials/equipment and labour – you likely don’t have these)<n><n>Option B: Raise (unlikely – requires labour, funds… probably requires building one piece at a time)<n><n>Option C: Entice (unlikely - may work for a house, not for a barn)<n><n>Option D: Build (Unlikely – building a barn would require a lot of labour and materials, and you probably don’t have these items either.)<n><n>Option E: Fix (unlikely – this would be building/constructing something)<n><n>This question is actually a reworded version of question 2.

Choices:  A: drop out of school B: ask questions C: enter school D: wash dishes E: read book<n><n>### Response:		<n>(Input - A: drop out of  school, before getting on the    bus)<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The question asks what a child might have to do after breakfast is eaten and before the bus arrives, which is the task being described. Analyzing the choices we have here:<n>   - Drop out of school (Option A) - A child needs to get on the bus at some point, so they can't be dropping out of school.<n>   - Ask questions (Option B) - This could be something they do before getting on the bus, and also before breakfast is eaten. So it doesn't really fit.<n>   - Enter school (Option C) - This fits, because the child enters school when the bus arrives, and breakfast is eaten before departing.<n>   - Wash dishes (Option D) - This doesn't fit, as the child's parent (ideally the child's mother) normally takes care of this activity after eating breakfast.<n>   - Read a book (Option E) - Analogously, this doesn't fit, because the child doesn't take the time to read a book after eating breakfast. It's the adult that does this if they have time.<n>2. Therefore the chosen answer is “enter school” (Option C) because it matches the description.<n><n>### Input<n>Someone could learn to drive without a manual transmission.<n><n>### Answer<n>Not everyone who learns to drive can do so without a manual transmission.

Where would he go to get one?

He will go to a store to buy a level.<n>1. The question asks Bob needs a level to get in his home but he can't find one in his home, which means he needs to go to a shop to get one.<n>2. Analyzing the choices:<n>   - The glass of water (Option B) is related to fluid levels, but it's not a level to hang a door/shelf.<n>   - The evenly (Option C) doesn't really say what kind of level would be used to hang a shelf, so it's possible that Bob might be looking for a level to hang the shelf. But a level that hangs things can't actually hang things: it would need to be on another surface.<n>   - The garage (Option D) could have a level to hang a car, but it's unlikely to have a level to hang shelves.<n>   - A carpenter's (Option E) would probably only have a level for hanging shelves or cars or other such objects.<n>3. Hence, the answer has to be a store, where they'd have a level for you to hang whatever you're hanging.<n>4. But maybe not to carry heavy loads, which is why Bob would need to get a level for his shop in the home, because he needs a level that carries heavy loads.<n><n>Answer: <n>

Choices:  A: were thirsty B: toasting C: getting drunk D: refreshment E: celebrating<n><n>### Response:		Everybody raised a ___________ and cheered, they are doing what?<n><n>### Rationales: 1: The question asks if everybody raised a drink and cheers.<n>2. Thus, we are looking at a group raising a drink. They could be getting drunk, but since the sentence doesn't specifically say, the answer has to be either a drink or a toast.<n>3. Analysing the options:<n>    - Everybody raised a drink (toast) and cheered (Option A)<n>    - Everybody got drunk (Option B)<n>    - Everyone was refreshed (Option C)<n>    - Every body toasted (Option D)<n>    - Every one was celebrating (Option E)<n>4. We cannot say refreshing as people could still be thirsty. The answer of the choice that makes the least sense is that everybody is getting drunk, but this doesn't really make sense in the context, since they are raising a drink. Hence, the answer would be they raised a drink and cheering (Option A).<n><n>### Input; In the world of football(soccer), the ball is the _________ object.

Choices: A: save the marriage B: stay together C: divorce D: try to avoid it E: divorce<n><n>### Rationale:<n>RATIONALES<n><n>* The person being divorced can be "grieved upon" because the marriage is now gone. That's a negative effect.<n>* The divorcee can easily be "depressed" if the marriage wasn't working anyway.<n>* The couple can continue to stay "together" or they can divorce. There's no longer a reason to stay so it's divorce at this point.<n>* The person divorcing can try "to avoid it" but that's really not a goal; it's more of an objective.<n>* The person who is getting divorced cannot divorce his or herself. That's why the answer is going to be "losing money."<n>* In addition, since the person is divorcing, the children can also suffer because, in almost every case, they will get 50/50 custody.<n>Answer: D: The divorcee loses money because the person who is being divorced cannot divorce themselves.<n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question asks where you would find some plumbing that would not be useful in relieving your thirst.<n>2. This means we're looking for a place where plumbing exists, but it doesn't carry potable water.<n>3. Analyzing the options:<n>   - Oil refineries (Option A) use extensive plumbing, but it's for transporting oil, not water.<n>   - The Wall (Option B) might have plumbing inside it for water transportation, which you could possibly use if you were thirsty.<n>   - The Show (Option C) could refer to a variety of things, including shows with plumbing displays.

Choices:  A: inspiration B: much work C: boredom D: graduate E: degree<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question asks what you do after attending school for 12 years. This is probably best answered by considering one of the multiple choice answers.<n><n>1. Inspiration (Option A) is the type of answer you'd expect this question to be looking for.<n>2. Much Work (Option B) might be a valid answer, as you'd likely have to study a lot and potentially do a lot of homework.<n>3. Boredom (Option C) sounds like it might be the answer the question is looking for, especially with alliteration as the first words of its different options.<n>4. Graduate (Option D) is certainly a relevant answer, but not necessarily the one sought by the question.<n>5. Degree (Option E) is not an answer at all, so that would not be the correct response; it is essentially asking you to answer the question for the question if that makes sense.<n><n>hence the answer is: much work<n><n>### Output:I was just reading about a time where someone got stuck with a piece of broccoli in their stomach causing it to hurt. What would you do to make them more content (given some options)? <n>Choices:  A: make it hurt even more B: chew it into tiny pieces C: laugh D: force it out E: chew a large amount of something else<n><n>### Answer:<n>From the question, it appears to be asking you to choose what you would do to make someone happy despite feeling pain from a piece of broccol stuck in their stomach.<n><n>1. Make it hurt even more sounds like an odd option, and not one I'd imagine the question would be asking for.<n>2. Chew it into tiny pieces also sounds like something the question shouldn't want, and instead you might want to think of what they'd want.<n>3. Laugh (option D) doesn't work since it likely is already sad in this scenario and would therefore not be able to laugh.<n>4. Force it out is a good choice, so the answer would be chew a large amount (Option E). This one works since people may want to get rid of what is inside the stomach and force it out.<n><n>### Input<n>Input: How did some ancient people take an adventure and make it fun?

Choices:  A) one page, B) two pages, C) two pages if the page is double-sided, D) four pages<n><n>### Response:-<n>1. The answer is page (Option A), because if you double the number of the pages in a book, then the number of page increases by 1 page<n>2. One way to check it is by multiplying the number of the page with 2 in the front. Then add it at the end with the number of the page and subtract one. Then see that the number of pages is equal to the product of the front and back of pages. <n>3. So it will be 2*2+1=4  <n>4. Then, the answer is two pages (Option B) in this question.<n><n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: mouth B: jars and all faces C: kentucky fried chicken D: hand E: human<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>1. The question asks which part of the body your lips are on.<n>2. Analyzing the choices:<n>   - Mouth: Not exactly the answer I'm looking for. Lips extend beyond the mouth itself. This means "mouth" is not the answer.<n>   - Hand: This doesn't match up at all. The lips definitely aren't on the hand.<n>   - Human: This choice is too generic. Lips are certainly on human faces.<n>   - Jars and all faces: This is very specific but not correct. They ask for the right location; a reference to some jars or face doesn't count.<n>   - KFC: A hilarious choice, but it really doesn't make sense in this context.<n>3. Therefore, the answer is C: "kentucky fried chickens".<n><n><n>```<n>!python3<n>import sys<n>sys.path.append("/home/student/python/code/")<n>import time<n>time.sleep(300)<n>```<n><n>### Instructions:<n>What would you like to do?<n><n>### Choices:  A.

The "continents" are not explicitly specified in the question, but the options are all in reference to places found on either land or under the water in the Atlantic ocean, i.e., A: fresh water, B: Gulf of Mexico, C: Open Ocean, and D: television programs.<n><n>The options A-C all refer to body of water. Biologist are most likely not observing marine life in their home. Therefore, the question narrows the search to an option which is not a body of water. This leads to the correct answer.<n><n>Option E: television programs is what biologists would find out about sharks if they were studying this shark. They would probably record the data and take that data to write their paper using "their television programs". This would not be helpful to them if they were migrating between continents as they would be going through the ocean and not a television program.<n><n>### Correct Responses:<n>The correct response is D: television programs as it does not fit into the criteria laid out in question:<n><n>1. migrating between continents indicates that the shark is traveling through the ocean<n><n>2. biologists are recording their data from different sources to write their paper<n><n>3. the tv programs would only be a medium and wouldn't help with their migration<n>

Choices:  A: fresh fruit B: wine press C: fruit basket D: fruit cocktail E: picnic basket<n><n>### Response:		Choice D or E, because the question says, 'One,' therefore, it can't be referring to more than one fruit cocktail, and there won't be two fruit baskets or more.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The question uses the term 'chop us,' which is a verb that generally refers to one person, so one person is choping for one other person for fresh fruit.<n>2. In the choices, a fruit basket (or 'basket') would contain more fruit than chop us needs to put into just one fruit cocktail.<n>3. Likewise, a fruit cocktail will contain only one (and possibly 2) cups of fruit juice, therefore, there will be only one or two cups of fruit juices (and possibly some ice cubes) for the fruit cocktail. The same is the case for the fruit basket (so the fruit basket would contain 2 cups of fruit juic) and the picnic basket ('basket') (so there would be 3 cups of fruit juict); the water cocktail and the wine press.<n>4. Hence the answer would be either the fruit cocktail or the fruit basket because the question says 'chop us,' so if you chop one, it would only make one fruit cocktail or fruit basket.<n>Answer: D: fruit cocktails or E: fruit basket<n>

Where is James? Choices:  A: dairy farm B: texas C: building D: michigan E: florida<n><n>### Response:		 Answering the question would involve knowing some information about the word outside.  This is something we can gain experience on.<n><n>### For example:<n><n>The question might ask: "How many days since the last day of April?"<n><n>However, the question asks about a "day outside of the April"<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. Looking at the options, one must find an idea of what "outside" would refer to.<n><n>For instance, we can conclude that "of the South" is referring to the south.  Or, if we're wondering where James would be on his trip, then the question would need to be phrased differently to consider that.<n><n>### Rationale 2:<n>2. If one could narrow down the options with some prior experience, then they could eliminate some choices. In this case, only one option has a date that is after the last day of April.<n><n>3. A steakhouse is not typically located in a cow field. The option "dairy farm" is thus eliminated.<n><n>### Example 3:<n>4. Similarly, steak and Texas are usually not paired together unless someone is craving barbeque. Hence, Texas is eliminated.<n><n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question asks where you would find some plumbing that would not be useful in relieving your thirst.<n>2. This means we're looking for a place where plumbing exists, but it doesn't carry potable water.<n>3. Analyzing the options:<n>   - Oil refineries (Option A) use extensive plumbing, but it's for transporting oil, not water.<n>   - The Wall (Option B) might have plumbing inside it for water transportation, which you could possibly use if you were thirsty.<n>   - The Show (Option C) could refer to a variety of things, including shows with plumbing displays.

Hence, the answer is the oil refineries (Option A) as there wouldn't be drinkable water there.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>### Input:The friends loved competing against one another, it was a good way to work their what? Choices:  A: friendship B: aggression C: defeat D: winning or losing E: sweat<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The question asks about 'what' the friends are competing against, and it wants us to find a non-aggression based option.<n>2. This question only has 5 options, however there are 3 types of aggression in the question - against one another, to win or lose, and to sweat. This leaves one more option: friendship.<n>3. Hence, the answer to this question is Friendship.<n>Answer: A- friendship<n><n>### Input :The friends decided that they would continue _______ as long as they lived.<n><n>### Response :<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. The sentence refers to a group of friends.<n>2. The friends all agree to continue the activity, however at the same time, the activity must be done by all these friends, and not just one or two of them.<n>3. This makes this activity 'a group activity'.<n>4. Hence, this sentence means that the group has decided to continue the group activity as long as they all lived.<n>Answer: B- group activity<n><n>### Input :(The friends agreed in a meeting that they should continue) ____<n><n>### Response :(In the meeting) ____<n><n>Rationale:<n><n>1. The sentence begins by saying they agreed in a meeting.<n>2. The question asks for a word to fill in the blank.<n>3. The correct response would be the first word of the sentence!<n><n>Answer: A- a meeting<n><n>### Input The friends liked to be on different teams, because they were too competitive together.<n><n>### RESPONSE They were too competitive.<n><n>### Input  In this sentence the friends are the people who want to know their birthdays, and the group is the people who they are going to celebrate it with. For them to celebrate their birthdays, what type of group activity would they need to do? Choose the one you think is closest to an answer<n><n>### RATIONALES The sentence says that the birthdays were celebrated with a group.<n><n>2. This means the friends want to do a group activity where they get to celebrate with their loved ones.<n>3. The birthday is a celebration of someone's existence, it's not a competition...so a best friends competition wouldn't make much sense.<n>4.

Choices:  A: turn away B: let down C: have to sleep D: run E: row boat<n><n>### Response:		<n>Choices:  A: Turn away<n>Rationales:<n><n>1. The question asks for the type of water transportation that is human powered.<n>2. There are four types of water transportation: canoe, boat, raft, and swimming.<n>3. Analyizing the options:<n>   * Turn away (Option A): This means that you're supposed to turn yourself away from the problem at hand to solve it.<n>   * Let down (Option B): This means that you use less resources to power the device down (the solution).<n>   * Have to sleep (Option C): This means that you have to go to bed to solve the problem at hand.<n>   * Run (Option D): This means you run to the other side to solve the problem.<n>   * Row boat (Option E): This means that you row or row another option to solve the problem athand.<n>4. So, the answer is let down (Option B) as it reduces its resources to power the device (i.e. rowing) down.<n><n>Answer: B: let down<n><n>### Input::A man is running downhill. If he ran downhill with less power, what would be the difference in the answer (i.e. faster or slower)? Choices:  A. Same B. Faster C. Slower D. He doesn’t move E.

Which of the banquet foods we're preparing will require the longest amount of time to cook?<n><n>### Response - Question<n>The answer to this question is "the cake", as it can be seen in the following rationale.<n><n>The chef stated that they needed to 'boil the potatoes to make the salad'. This suggests that they are cooking said potatoes, requiring significant amount of time. However, in the middle of their description of 'toasting the bread', it states that the dish has one more part yet to cook that will take longer - namely, the cake.<n><n>The banquet foods that the chef is preparing include roasted potatoes, mashed potatoes, and the cake.<n>The kitchen is already full of food: There is a large bowl of 'roasted potatoes' prepared earlier, and one more is described as 'boiling'. Additionally, 'bread is... already baking, and toasting', with 'cake' noted as the last part of 'the course to be prepared'.<n><n>This means that it is the least certain of the foods to be prepared. The salad preparation is described in a detailed step-by-step manner: The boiling potatoes, making the dressing, and then the salad being tossed. And the kitchen is already full of other foods - bread is being toasted, toasted, mashed potatoes are to be boiled, and the cake is left as the last to be cooked, though the time taken for its preparation is unknown to us.<n><n>### Question<n>- Which answer choice best states another step in preparation to clean a dish?

The place I'm likely to get deodorant from (option B) would be a medicine chest, usually used for storing household medications. Using this as our base, we'll ask: Would I put a stick of deodorant in my medicine chest? <n>Not likely as it's used to store medications, not deodorant.<n><n>3. The next closest option would be the medicine cabinet, but you wouldn't be applying deodorant here.<n><n>4. Using the kitchen (option E) would mean you went into the kitchen to get it?

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question asks where you would find some plumbing that would not be useful in relieving your thirst.<n>2. This means we're looking for a place where plumbing exists, but it doesn't carry potable water.<n>3. Analyzing the options:<n>   - Oil refineries (Option A) use extensive plumbing, but it's for transporting oil, not water.<n>   - The Wall (Option B) might have plumbing inside it for water transportation, which you could possibly use if you were thirsty.<n>   - The Show (Option C) could refer to a variety of things, including shows with plumbing displays. But these would probably have potable water.<n>   - Own home (Option D) would assuredly have useful plumbing for drinking water.<n>   - Water fountain (Option E) definitely would have plumbing carrying potable water.<n>4. Hence, the answer is the oil refineries (Option A) as there wouldn't be drinkable water there.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>### Input:Who sits at the center table at a receeption? Choices:  A: restorand B: wedding party C: church basement D: corridor E: restaurant<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: B: Wedding party<n>### Demonstation:<n>Explanation:<n>1. The question asks who sits at the center tables at a reception.<n>2. When we're planning a reception, it's traditional to put a wedding party (Option B) and a bride and groom at the center of the head table (rather than just one or the other).<n>3. All other possible answers would likely end up with two or three people at the center of the table. This is unlikely—a reception requires more than just the head of the wedding party to sit at this center table.<n>4. Because of this factor, coupled with the fact that the only two options with more than one person are only people at a wedding, the answer is B: Wedding party.<n>      <n>### Input: Why would a doctor make a house call? Choices:  (A) because the hospital is overcrowded (B) the patient is in a home with the nearest relative (C) to provide comfort and assisstance overnight (D) because the hospital doesn't offer the latest in equipment (E) for convenience (F) all of the above are equally valid reasons<n><n><n>### Demostration:<n>Explanation : A : Because the hospitals is overcrowded <n><n>### Explanation:<n>1. The question asks why a doctor would make a house call.<n>2. Analyzing the statements, we can identify the following:<n>   - B is the only option not referring to a house call (Option B)<n>   - Hospitals have beds, examination rooms, and personnel; whereas, houses do not.<n>   - A is the correct answer because the doctor would possibly not make a house call if it was because the patient was at a relative's house.<n>   - C and D aren't plausible reasons; the hospital's location wouldn't be a determinant factor in why the doctor made the house call:<n>     - The patient could be moved to an examination room.<n>     - The patient or doctor could stay at the hospital<n>3. Hence, the answer to the question is A: Because the hospital is overcrowsed<n><n><n>### Input : What would you find where water and oil are mixed on the floor? Choices: . A: The

Choices:  A: relax B: dreams C: have nightmares D: restlessness E: snore<n><n>### Response:		<n>We can't find the right answer because there is no relation between the choice and what prevents someone from getting to sleep.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The question asks us what prevents someone from getting sleep.<n>2. We need to think about what prevents people from getting sleep in a positive light. As there are several words that could be used to prevent sleep, we need to determine the correct choice.<n>3. Analysing the choices:<n>   - Relax(Option A) means a period of rest. But that's something that would be done in the day time. Having to do the word relax here is the wrong answer if the question was meant to be asked as "What prevents people from getting sleep at night?"<n>   - Dreams (Option B) are an important aspect of sleep, but they are a cause or effect of sleep, rather than what would prevent someone from getting to sleep at night.<n>   - Nightmares(Option C) also are a feature of sleep that could prevent someone from sleeping, but it would mean having nightmares while sleeping at night, which is the opposite of the question's meaning.<n>   - Restlessness (Option D) is a symptom in not getting sleep, rather than what prevents someone from sleeping.<n>   - Snore (Option E) could refer to a number of disruptive bodily sounds, including sleep, but snoring usually doesn't prevent people from getting to sleep (sometimes it does, but then this question was worded the wrong way).<n>4. Hence, we should answer the question as it is meant to be, having been worded incorrectly.<n>Answer: None of these options should be used, as they are all incorrect uses of the word prevention.<n><n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>The following question describes a situation.

Choices: 1: Sails back to where it started. 2: Drives onto shore. 3: Finds another way to the destination. 4: Curses out the captain. 5: Looks like a complete loss.<n><n>Rationales:1. Since the only options refer to navigation, a ship would not be in the ocean or lake where it has a rudder and lose its rudder.<n>2. A ship would never drive to shore because that would mean that it has landed at sea and can no longer be navigated.<n>3. Drives to shore is ambiguous as it could refer to a car drive to shore. In this case, the answer would be A.<n>4. There is no other navigation word that is in the same category as Drives onto shore so you should rule this out.<n>5. None as the choices are 1,2,3,4, and 5 are all things that a ship can do when it loses its ruder. The only exception is 4. Since this is a multiple choice test, the test maker might be looking for a way to exclude option 4.<n>Answer: B: Finds another way<n><n><n>## Clarification:The answer is an input.

Choices:  A: conference B: theater C: building D: floor E: church<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Why I think it is E: church<n><n>In this example, the task asks the user for an answer as to where they would buy a ticket to sit, which is indicated by the keyword "sit". Because there is ambiguity in how this could be done in different locations, the goal here is to specify a location in which you could buy the ticket. This excludes both conference (Option A) and theater (Option B) because both would have no chairs that would be facing the same direction. Furthermore, the building (Option C) is unlikely to have a room where you could buy the ticket without the chairs facing in the same direction, and there are no chairs there. Finally, the floor (Option D) could have chairs, but not the one specified by the question as facing in the same direction. So we are left with three choices: church (Option E), because it is a location that could conceivably have multiple chairs all facing the same direction.<n><n>### Input:"Why did they say they wanted to know the answers?"

It is not clear why such a question would be asked - you would think the point of the questioning was to learn about some answers. However, the choice of subjects that would know 'the answers' may be based on their relationship to the subject which knows these answers. The only choice relevant in this respect is 'To Know The Answers', because the rest of the choices seem to be asking which they wanted.<n>

Therefor they must be keys that are on a chain, but not a purse or piano.<n>The answer is therefore B, C, D<n><n>### Input :What do you get when you cross a lemonade and a limeade? Choices: 1A) Lemon lime 1B) Lemon soda 2A) Lime lime 2B) Limeade<n>Rationales:In this one, the question is what you get when you cross lemonade and limeade. There are three answers: Lemon Lime (A) which crosses a lemon and a lime, Lemon Soda (B) which crosses a soda and a lemonade, Lime Lime (A) crossing up a lime and a lemon, and Limeade (B crossing up a lime with a lime. Since the question says "you cross" a lemonade and lamide. It is only the Lemonade and Lemon lime. You can't get Lemonade and Lime lime because that doesn't technically cross anything. Or Lime lime because they already cross them once. Lime soda can be eliminated because it says lemonade and lame.

Choices:  A: landscape B: east side C: countryside D: middle america E: georgia<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The artist may have been famous for very plain what was actually his landscapes.

But, we didn't choose these options, we were given them. The word 'view' may be confusing for the student to understand, as it may convey different connotations, meaning that he would be confused whether the question is asking the artist of the landscapes to be famous for his views or he painted landscapes. Hence, the student may be unsure of whether the answer choices are correct or incorrect.<n><n>The student's confusion was due to the wrong choice of options. Hence, the correct choice was to give more options that contain what the student is actually thinking.<n>

Choices:  A: university B: concert C: home D: terminal E: airport<n><n>### Response:		Terminal<n><n>### Rationale 1:<n>The question asks about highly criticized security. <n><n>### Rational 2:<n>The choices for this questions are either places or activities<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Terminals have a reputation for being highly criticized for their security. This can also apply to airports in general, since they might have a large terminal. Concerts might have relatively bad security, but this is usually a concern for the guests and attendees, not the venues themselves, especially not a university. Homes can also have bad security as well. This can be a very serious problem when it comes to personal homes, but is less likely to be a problem in public colleges. Finally, if a home (or a college) has a bad record of security, this is most likely to be noticed by the public and therefore be highly criticized by authorities. The airport (Option E) is definitely a place that could easily be criticized for its security and is included in the other options. This leads us to conclude that the terminal (Option D) is the correct answer. <n><n>## Instruction:<n>Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n><n>### Input What type of building does have a high number of bathroom stalls?<n><n>### Option A: Concert Hall<n><n>### Option B: Library<n><n>### Option C: Mall<n><n>### Option D: Museum<n><n>### Ration:<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>Answer the following multiple-choice questions.<n><n>## Input:<n><n>What building type allows a person to play in or on?<n>A: University<n>B: Concert Hall<n>C: Library<n>D: Terminal<n>E: Museum<n><n>## Rationale<n><n>This question is asking about a question that contains the building type "Play": This can be a person inside or outside of a building, like "On a Football Field in a Concert Hall" or "In a Library", etc.<n><n>## Answer<n><n>A: University<n>

Choices:  A: shoes B: wet ground C: wet clothes D: start to fall E: water garden<n><n>### Response:		<n>Demonstration: There are various reasons you shouldn't walk barefooted after a big rainstorm.<n>1. Let's consider the rain first.<n>   - **Option A: Shoes**: Wearing shoes would help prevent you from getting a fungus when walking in areas with standing water.<n>   - **Options B-E: Wet Ground**: Wet clothing would get water to stick to the skin of your feet, increasing the possibility of blisters and fungus, which can ultimately hurt you. As for wet walking areas, you'd definitely have damp and slippery shoes walking on a surface where there is puddles of water forming.<n>   - The water fountains you might be looking for would be Option E, but we do not know where the fountains are exactly.<n>     >  It's a garden, so probably the plants have moisture.<n>2. The water garden (Option E) would involve plant life producing high moisture. But the rain itself, even though very wet, was falling from the clouds above. This, however, may not help our answer because we are unaware of where the fountains in the garden are. They might be in the center of the plant area and dry from all the water.<n>3. Therefore, we look at the possibility of puddles on the ground.<n>   - There would definitely be puddles forming everywhere from the rain. So it is not impossible for you to walk barefooted on the ground and get some water inside your shoes.<n>4. Moreover, walking outside in the rain is a dangerous. You would have a chance of slipping and falling. When you fall, it makes your joints stiff, causing damage to your body.<n>5. Considering all the factors, we should all stay with our shoes.<n>Answer: D: start to fall

Choices A: talk B:read book C:play piano D:study book E:study engineering Rational: Inputs:<n>- "what is a student about to" - this suggests that a student doesn't really know what they are about to do, so they can do anything.<n>- "the black and white keys" - these are musical keys, and so a student could be about to play music, which is what the choices suggest.<n>Analysis: Choices - Choices A, B and C talk of reading, studying and playing, whilst choice D mentions engineering. This all means that the student may study for engineering, or any other subject really, or play piano and read a book at the same time.<n>Option A: Talk<n>Rationale: The student may be talking to someone about their piano performance on the black and white piano keys in fron of them. Since a piano was used as the context for the question, talking about the piano is the most relevant response choice.<n>Option B: Read<n>Rationale: The choice mentions book and black and white piano keys. This is in accordance with the context of the question thus it must be the answer option.<n>Option C: play piano<n>Rationale: Choice mention the black and white piano key and the student is sitting in front of it. Choice 'play piano' is therefore the valid answer to the question.<n>Option D: study book<n>Rationale: The choices are related to reading a book, studying a book, and playing a piano(key). As the student is sitting in the front of black and white piano keys, the choice study a book is the appropriate answer.<n>Option E: study an engineering<n>Rationale: Engineering is a subject. The student must do that. The choices mention studying a book and piano too, but not engineering. So the student must study engineering.<n><n>   1.

But, the question is asking about panda displays, so we can't use Choice D or E. Looking at Choice D, we find that the question was referring to the koala display, which is obviously not a panda. Therefore, we can eliminate that option. Choice E, for a child's book could be referring to panda books. But, there is an answer choice that would still make sense in relation to a plumbed panda display, namely, the Australian Outback. We can combine this with our other option, which is jungle, which would refer to the Australian jungle, which are home to koalas. Additionally, the questions asks what we'd usually find a koala in. And when looking at the other choices, there would likely be no plumbing, unless a stuffed panda happened to be found in the bamboo forest.<n><n>## Question 1:<n><n>### Input<n>Where could you find some plumbering that would not be used if you were thirstly?<n><n>### Response A<n><n>A, B, C, and D would not be of use.

Choices: \nA: gently B: slowly C: swiftly D: easily E: quickly\nRationales: There is only one choice that correctly describes how the ocean rises or falls: Choice E: quickly.\nIf we consider options A and B, they both describe the motion of the ocean as \"gently\" or \"slowly\" which mean the motion is not fast or abrupt.\nThese options are incorrect when considering how the ocean behaves which is in fact \"quickly\". Similarly, options D and E are ruled out because they refer to how the motion can be \"easily\" and \"swiftly\" which, again, do not have similar connotations to \"quick\".\nThe only answer that aligns with the given description of the ocean is Choice E which refers to \"quickly\".\nAnswer: E, quickly\nInput: How would one describe the effect of a virus on a cell that's not susceptible to infection?

Choices: A: bigger B: stronger C: fatter D: taller E: faster\nRationales: A. Answer choice \"A: bigger\" is not a verb, as it is written. B. When one says, \"It's been known to\" we can tell that it is not a fact, it is a statement. C. Bigger is an answer, because it shows that the snake is not bigger than other things that it eats, it was more skillful than other things, or faster than other things. D. Bigger does not explain why the snake never ate a human. \"Human\" is an object and the question is: \" A snake never made (a verb) a human meal \" so, it's either it's never ate a human, or it's never eaten people, or human beings, or whatever you want to interpret. E. \"Why?\" is the question that the answer needs to be, therefor \" Taller\" is the answer choice because \" why the snake never eats a human\" is one of the answers, and we need to know why.\n\nInput: Can bone be made of meat?

Choices: facial expression, lips, teeth smile\nRationales: If the child came home, there is a high probability that the child's home was his father's. It can also be inferred that the child returned home alone. This combined with his father having a big smile on his face leads us to two conclusions:\n\n1. the father was very happy about the child returning home, and\n\n2. the child may have been away for some time and returned to find no one else home.\n\nThe word \"smile\" and the accompanying image of the big smile on the father's face leads us to deduce that it is his face that should have a big smile on it. Thus, the answer choice with a person having a big smile is \"face\" and the answer should be \"face.\"\n\nAnswer: Face", "answer": "D: louisiana"}

The possible locations of this paperclip are limited to a purse, jacket, bag, pants, or another location within the bag.\n 2. The paperclip can only logically be located in the bag.\n 3. The locations 'purse' and 'jacket' are more likely to be home to more personal items like clothes or other accessories.\n 4. The location 'pants' could be the bag itself or inside a pocket or pant.\n 5.

Choices:  B: snowy  B: sunny B: windy C: hurricane E: stormy\nRationales: The question is asking which weather condition/phenomena can create/cause a hard time for humans. Options A and B are incorrect as these two options state that specific weather conditions don't cause difficulties or hard times for people. Option C is correct as it states that humans are often affected adversely by a hurricane, an intense collection of thunderstorm cells that rotate inward towards a centre. Option D is incorrect as it states that storm is a type of weather condition, and therefore cannot cause problems for humans or affect them adversely. Thus, the option that completes the request is Option C \"hurricane\". Answer: B: hurricane\n\nInput: A large ship carrying a cargo was unable to move, where was it supposed to depart from? Choices:  C: harbor D: cargo E: dock F: shipyard\nRationales: All options in the problem statement are places where ships are generally used, and hence must be related to departures. As mentioned earlier, a harbor is a place where ships wait and anchor. In this case, the place where the ship was supposed to depart was the shipyard, not the harbor. Options A and B, however, are redundant and incorrect as places where large ships are built are called shipyards and do not indicate any relevance to the departure of a vessel. Thus, the correct option completing the request is \"F: shipyard.\"\n\nInput: What part of a car typically has a large number of moving components?

Choices: \nA: spider B: snake C: bird D: beetle E: bat\nRationales:1. Based on the given context (i.e. in a story), we need to identify which animal out of the choice list is not poisonous.\n2. We know from the available choices that B: snake, C: bird, D: beetle, and E: bat are all animals that are often considered poisonous by most people.\n3. The only animal that isn't poisonous in the story is A: spider, which is further confirmed by the question because it explicitly asks us to identify which one was not poisonous, thus excluding it from the possible options.\nAnswer: A : spider\n\nInput: How should one keep warm during the cold weather? Choices:  B: wear hat and gloves C: drink hot tea D: put on multiple pairs of sweaters E: keep head covered \nRationales:\n1. In the given context (cold weather), we know what types of clothing and accessories are typically worn.\n2. The question refers to keeping warm during cold weather, with \"warm\" suggesting that there is not enough heat to keep people comfortable.\n3. We also know that the options \"put on multiple pairs of sweatshirts\" and \"drink hot tea\" could help someone who is cold feel more comfortable while also keeping their body warm.\n4. However those options would not help someone stay warm.\n5. The options \"wear hat and gloves\" and \"keep head covered\" could keep someone warm. Though we know they typically refer to protecting someone from the cold, we can infer that they also involve keeping body temperature consistent.\n6. Therefore the answer is B: wear hat and GlovesC: drink hot tea\nAnswer: B: wear hat  and glovesC: drink hot  tea\n\nInput: Marmots will eat berries.  Which might they not eat, a berry or a grass?

Choices:  a: midnight b: noon c: 1 am d: 2 am e: 3 am\nRationales: Answer a: 1 am Question word: 'What\" question form: Which indicates the context here is a place or geographical location.\nWe know that temperature is measured in Celsius, and 27 degrees Celsius is a common temperature for the Earth's atmosphere to be at. We can guess as to what the question is asking if we think about the temperature as the Earth's atmosphere temperature and not of a particular place. At 27 degrees Celcius or 12 hours after noon (12 pm exactly) the Earth reaches its peak temperature, just before 12 am.\nSince the Earth's atmosphere is generally heated by the Sun in its orbit around it over a period of 24 hours, we can assume that it has cooled down since the Sun reached its peak noontime hours earlier and noon.\nThis means the planet as a whole has cooled down 1 degree from 11 pm till 12 am. However, it's important that we know at what temperature the Sun's rays usually fall.\nWe read about the question and know the temperature at 12 pm was 18 degrees and know that the peak 28 degrees before it started to cool down at 12 pm. By process of elimination, we know that the temperature is not at 11 degrees at 12 pm since the question said temperature at 12pm was 18 degrees.\nThe only choice left then would be at what temperature is the Earth's atmosphere at it's peak? And that would be a temperature of 27 degrees, 28 degrees, or 1 degree hotter.\nThis means the answer is noon, or 1:00, with an extension that the temperature was at 18 degrees, not 11 degrees when Sun begins to fall on Earth.\n\nAnswer A: Noon to 12:00 AM; not between midnight to 11", "answer": "D: headache"}

The word \"fisherman\" typically refers to a man who catches fish, while \"fishermaiden\" refers to a female.\nSimilarly, the phrase \"fisherboy\" refers to a male fisherman who catches fish. As we asked \"Are you a fisherman?\" it means that the person should pick either fisherman or fisherboy.\nAnswer: Yes, I am a fisherman\n\n\n### Instructions:What is the correct response to the question below?

If you have two dogs and you need a dog that can hear, which dog is what? Choices: A: bark B: yelp C: howl D: caterwaul E: squeak\nRationales: The first step is to understand the connotation of the term 'dog'.  When the question speaks about dogs, there are two options: a human and a pet dog.  In this case, the term is referring to a pet dog. Next, the question suggests that the pet dog can hear better than a cat.  \nThe question implies that there is a need to have a dog that is able to hear rather than just being an ordinary pet dog. Finally, the question makes it clear that the option available are different types of sounds a dog can make.  Since a dog is capable of making one type of sound, it can easily select another type of sound. The available options are: bark, howl, caterwaul, yelp, and squeak. \nIn most scenarios, the bark is the sound a dog uses to alarm/alert others, that's why we can eliminate A: bark. The other option is howl.  It is a dog's sound to convey emotions, so we can eliminate C: howl. Next, A: caterwaul is a very unique type of sound that dogs make to communicate stressful situations to other dogs.  We can also eliminate D: caterwauls. Now, our two choices left are: bark and yelp. In this case, A: yelp  is used by dogs  to greet others, and they might yelp to welcome you when they greet you.  Since our only choice left is yelp, the answer is A.\nAnswer: A : yelp\n\nInput: After you bought a car, the salesman took you all over this area, where was the salesman?

Can you name it? Choices:  Tiger, Penguin, Bat, Wolf A: tiger B: Penguin C: bat D: wolf E: none\nRationales:  1. The question is a mix of 'question and answer'. It asks for us to identify an animal referred to in the phrase,'it hides well', the options are listed alphabetically.\n2. Considering that the clue is \u2018it hides well' and we are finding an animal, we need to think about animals that are known for hiding well.\n3. We need to think of animals and their characteristics.\n4. Now, we know that a 'bat' can hide or fly in the dark.\n5. Since, 'bat' is the only option which has both the meanings. Hence, the answer choice is C: bat.\nAnswer: C\\: bat\n\nInput: The man in the library was looking for a book that was what? Choices: tall and short, heavy and light, thin and thick, wide and narrow A: thick and not thin\nB: wide and not narrow\nC: tall and not short\nD: heavy and not light\nE: thick and not light\nRationales:\n1. The man in the library didn't find the book and when asked about it, he said the book was \"thick and not thin\".\n2. What is asked in the question is to identify the book that matches the condition.\n3. From the choices given below we know that these meanings apply to the following books.\n4. Thus the three options we can choose from are \"tall and short\", \"wide and narrow\" and \"thick and not thin.\"\n5. We know that the first choice is impossible because we are looking for a book's qualities that are not matching with the qualities given by the man. So the first option is rejected.\n6. The second option has a different meaning from the statement made by the man, so is also rejected.\n7.

Choices: A: seafood dish B: steak C: filet D: fish Dinner E: soup\nRationales: The question is about a chef who served many meals and the best one served was the dish known as the '_____'. We have to choose the word that describes or completes that dish's name. \n1. A: seafood disdish is a suitable option because we know it has seafood in it. However, we can eliminate A as the answer because we do not know what the seafood dish is. \n2. B: steak is a suitable option. However, we can also eliminate B as the answer because it is too specific to steak. \n3. C and D only are still viable options to the question. However, the question is not asking us to choose a dish between fish and steak. So it is not between C and D. \n4. D: fish is another option suitable to the question. However there is more to the question than it is not the whole answer. So it is not the answer. \n5. E: soup is an option. We should select the first word which is from our vocabulary. It is not a full meal and it is not just seafood either. So E is the correct answer. \nAnswer: D\n\nInput: The book was really bad, it had what on nearly every page?

Therefore, the correct answer must convey the author\u00b4s bad writing. \n1. We can eliminate the word\" good\" because the author has written a lot of bad books.

Understand the structure and meaning of sentence:\n\n#### Infer the meaning of the sentence\n\nInferring the meaning of the sentence is the key to answering this question. The question is quite ambiguous about the exact meaning of the word efficient, so we need to look at the context to grasp the meaning. By inference, it means to have a proper working order or way of organizing the tasks and their details or an ability to complete the task at hand without wasting time. Another interpretation of efficient as \u201cat its best level of use, effectiveness\u201d is not appropriate because \u201cat its best\u201d and \u201cmost productive\u201d would describe an exceptional example rather than the general meaning described above.\n\n### 2. Eliminate the incorrect phrases and identify the correct sentence\n\nLooking at the options, we can eliminate all phrases and sentences that clearly do not convey the meaning of efficient. One of the options says shoes do not cover the upper part of the body, which is definitely false \u2013 because it is possible to be efficient while wearing shoes. Another option says to be efficient when we are running, we can wear shorts, which is another clear exception because it is possible to run efficiently without wearing shorts.\n\n### Choosing the correct answer\n\nFrom the remaining four", "answer": "B: feel good"}
{"text": "hand.\n7. Therefore we can infer that option 'E: tree' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: E, tree\n\nInput: Marmots are generally not found alone.  Instead, sometimes  they're in groups.  Where is this more likely to happen? Choices:  B: the top of a large tree A: outside C: inside D: on a beach E: in a cave\nRationales:1. The problem statement tells us we need to figure out the scenario where some Marmots are more likely to live together.\n2. Considering available options, \"A: outside\" and \"D: on a beach\" may initially seem like good options.\n3. However, the word \"outside\" can potentially connote a vast area encompassing more than likely one environment.\n4. So, if we decide to go the latter option, 'D: on a beach' would not be a good choice because there is more than a single environment.\n5. This is akin to the options \"C: inside\" and \"E: in a cave\".\n6. In addition to all these options being enclosures of some sort,  we can see that some of them would not allow for easy access by groups of Marmots, either due to restrictions on entry or size of the place.\n7. In fact, we can reasonably rule out 'A: outside' because we know the Marmots are more frequently clustered together in an underground cave, the opposite of 'outside'.\n8. Looking at the remaining choices, we identify 'B: top of a large tree'. On top of a large tree, it is indeed possible for Marmots to gather together. Furthermore, climbing up the trunk or branch requires them to use their feet and hands, both of which contribute to making them easier to cluster together.\n9. Therefore, we can deduce that 'B: top of large tree' is the best answer to the question.\nAnswer: B, top of a large tree\n\n1. Marmots live in groups\n2.

In order to eradicate a computer virus you need to either back it up, delete files, delete data or install a program.

While there are a lot of cities in the world, the question only refers to three of them which might narrow our options at the choices given by the question.\n3. Moreover, there is an interval given - \"(40 km - A - 15 km 25 km - B - 10 km 10 km - C)\" - which will give us the minimum and maximum possibilities\n4. The question seeks to find a distance of 10 km between the cities. Therefore, the minimum of the distance provided by the question is 15 km and the maximum is 40 km.\n5.

Also, growing things requires certain conditions that may or may not be suitable for growing plants.\n3. B: garden is also not suitable as it is not a place we usually obtain the fruits from.\n4. D: desert is excluded because deserts have temperatures that can potentially destroy the mango or make it very hard to grow them.\n5.

Choices:   A: car B: book C: house D: watch E: ring\nRationales:  1. The sentence 'the woman was angry when the Man walked out and decided to' implies an action the woman was taking.\n2. We need to analyze the choice given to find a possible action.\n3. Options B, C and D are describing things (a book, a house and a watch), not actions.\n4. Option E: Ring is also describing a thing, not an action.\n5. Option A: car is also describing a thing.\n6. After ruling out A and E, we will consider the remaining options and try to match the sentences with the context.\n7. When a woman is angry, it could be related to an argument or discussion, wherein both parties need to come to some resolution by the end.\n8. With that being said, it should be a tangible object of value.\n9. Car and book do not fit the description as they do not represent any tangible asset.\n10. Now, to understand why D does not quite work, we need to check if a watch is an asset. There is a high chance, most people would agree that a watch is a 'asset' and it has been used by the man to represent 'time', that too in context of the discussion between the man and the woman as he walked out of the house.\n11. Now for the big one, C - the house. It is true that the woman could be angry because the man walked out of the house, that is possible. However, in such case, she would not be buying a house but rather the man's place in the house. So, in that case, it does not work either.\n12. This leaves us only with B: Book.\n13. For the following reasons, the sentence can make sense only when B is the answer: it is tangible, it is of value, and it could have caused the conflict between the man and the women.\n14.

Choices:  D: hair A: clothes B: coat C: fur\nRationales:\n1. The contextual description here is related to an animal covering its fur after coming out of a bath.\n2. There is the potential that the animal used some sort of clothing other than fur to cover its body. Clothes and coat do not meet the description.\n3. Fur and hair are two different kinds of fiber and thus, can not be interchangeable meanings.\n4.

To find the accurate answer, we need to find out if the cat is alive or not.\n3. It's important to note, the question does not indicate that the cat died at some point, which can allow one to make the assumption that the cat is still living.\n4.

Choices: \tA: calm B: turbulent C: unsettled D: unchangeable E: unstable\nRationales:1. The question refers to the word habitat, where it asks us to consider the words \"at the bottom of the sea\".\n2. Habitat as understood here is a natural environment to which a living organism has become adapted.\n3. The question implies that the word \"habitat\" will be referring to the physical and environmental attributes and characteristics that are relevant for the fish in the context of its ecology and biophysical surroundings.\n4. The choice, 'D: unchangeable' is wrong as the habitat is meant to be fluid, dynamic, and relevant to the environment of the said fish.\n5. Choices 'A: calm' and 'B: turbulent' are words that are meant to describe the environment of the sea floor where the fish might be.\n6. However, the physical environment of the sea floor is not something that should affect the habitat nature of the organism in question.\n7. If the environment is calm with little wave motion, it would not be a habitat problem. Similarly if the environment was turbulent, it wouldn't be a habitat crisis as well.\n8.

We're given a clue that the wardrobe was \"too small\" for something.\n\n2. This implies that the wardrobes could originally be able to hold a lot more than what it was.\n\n3. Thus, the problem pertains to an excess of items.\n\n4. Looking at the options, they are all items that can \"fit' in a wardrobe.\n\n5. We can infer from the options not mentioned that the wardroble could originally hold more than those in the question.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Input: A warehouse needs people to sort and stack merchandise.\n\n# Output: People are the warehouses that sort and stack merchadise.\n\n# Input: We shouldn't trust our intuitions more than evidence.\n\n# Output\" A person's intuition is a person's evidence.\n\n# Input Where did the chicken coop go? \n\n# Output: They're at the bottom of my backyard.\n\n# Instruction:How many items in the question do you need to answer the question correctly?\n\n# Output: 3\n\n#### Demonstration\n1.

Choices:  None A: they didn't want the position B: they already had a job C: they didn't like the boss D: they didn't understand the position E: they didn't care about it\nRationales: The problem statement is asking why the boss wanted the position, but nobody wanted it. The keyword here is 'but', which is what shows the discrepancy.\n\n1. The answers to the question are not about the boss or why the application stopped so the first three answers are definitely not relevant.\n2. From the remaining answers:\n  1. A: they don't want the position - We can eliminate this because we know there is a boss and it would not make sense if there were no-one left to answer the job advertisement at the end of the question.\n  2. B: they already have a job - We could eliminate this option as that would not make sense with the given problem because someone already working elsewhere should not be applying.\n  3. C: they don't like the bosss - Eliminate this as they have applied for the job and so the boss can't be doing something so that no-one wants the position.\n3. D: they don't understand the position - This could be plausible although it relies on the boss not doing something that causes the lack of applicants.\n4.

In this example, the question talks about how the professor teaches.\n3. Based on the given options, we understand that some piece of equipment or instrument the professor used is essential for the method he or she devised for teaching.\n4. The chair, desk, and a piece of paper all imply something static, while the blackboard and the pen imply a dynamic characteristic.\n5. While the desk and chair could be utilized as instruments during the professor\u2019s teachings, we know the professor was looking for something unique because he found a way to teach uniquely.\n6.

Choices: 0: He pulls up the fish with his hands 1: He hooks it with a hook 2: He reels it in 3: He fishes it out of water with a net 4: They dangle the fish \nRationales: In this example, we understand the key attribute or characteristic of hooking is about capturing a fish with a hook.\n5. The first option seems to imply some kind of movement or pulling of the fish.\n6. The second option implies a change in state from unhooked to hooked.\n7. The third option sounds like it would imply some kind of dragging, but it only indicates reeling.\n8. The fourth option sounds very confusing. There isn't likely to be a fish dangling on a fisherman.\n9. We are left with the fifth option as the correct answer.\n10. The fish is hooked and this results in the correct action of capturing, catching or reeling it.\n11.

The question asks if the plane was \"departing\" or \"arriving\" which may refer to being in the sky by the word \"plane\". \n3.

We know the chef prepares food, and is therefore not likely to make a snack, dessert, or appetizer for the dinner party.\n\n4. Additionally, the choices are all likely categories of food that the chef could make.\n\n5. The only choice that doesn't involve a specific meal is 'E: soup'.\n\n6.

The question starts with \u201cA small number of grapese\u201d which indicates a small number of grapede are on the table.

Since the grapes are right now on the table/dinner plate, it must be obtained from a different location.\n4. There are multiple places where you can get grapes. They can be grown on a farm (or vineyard), in a store or sold directly or packaged in a supermarket or grocery store, in a garden or yard, or in a wine country or vineyard.\n5. Of those places, the only place one would get one or a small number of gapes is from a farmer. Farmers harvest, pack, and sell grapes.

'I said, 'Why?'' He explained.  'If we try to think of the words in the sentence as a sentence that they're saying, one of the words is a verb, and we'll have to figure out which is the noun, and how the verbs apply to the noun.

The remaining choice I: other leaders best describes what the leader explained. The other leaders were around him, and he used their contributions as key factors to his success.\n7. This makes, I: other leaders, the most correct choice.\nAnswer: I: other leaders\n\nInput: When was the last time you used a calculator? Choices:  M: math lesson  A: middle school B: first class C: after school D: elementary school\nRationales:1. The question asks for the last time you used the calculator.\n2. Choices 'C: After school' and 'D: elementary school' do not refer to the use of a calculator.\n3. Choices 'A: first-year and B: middle school' are also incorrect because the statement in context refers to something that happened in the recent past.\n4. This leaves us with 'M: Math lesson'. The math lesson refers to a class in the recent past, therefore it has the most relevance here.\nAnswer: M: Math lesson\n\nInput: I can't believe he'd lie to me, I thought he was my friend, I will no longer have to", "answer": "B: patience"}

Hence the answer is 'E: tree'.\nAnswer: E: tree\n\nInput: The man's daughter had an accident and was taken to the local hospital, which can what? Choices: A: support B: save C: heal D: cure E: treat\nRationales: We're asked about the type of treatment a woman's daughter got at the hospital, and there are six choices with varied meanings and associated words.\n1. Although C: \"Heal\" could conceivably refer to the hospital, it's a term that more typically refers to the body's process of physically repairing itself.\n2. Additionally, E: \"Treat\" is the word used by most hospitals to identify their services. It's a bit of a stretch to associate this word with the treatment of an accident victim.\n3. Finally, D: \"Can not\" is gramatically incorrect; the sentence does not ask about the capabilities of the hospital at all, which implies that the options need to relate to the action described by the word \"treat\", which it can not.\n4. Ruling out options A: \"Support\", B: \"Save\", and D, this leaves us with options C\"Heal\", and E: \"Treats\".\n5. In contrast to the hospital's name, we can assume that the daughter's name does not start with an \"E\". So, when choosing between a name for the hospital and the woman's daughter we want to rule out E: \"Treating\".\n6. The only other option, C: \"Heal\", is grammatically incorrect.\n7. As a result, A and B are left as the only viable answers to choose between. Both of these words indicate that the woman's daughter was either taken to or given treatment within a hospital.\n8. They essentially tell us that the daughter was helped by the hospital.\n9. Thus when considering all the details of the problem, A: \"Support\", and B: \"Heal\" are the valid answer.\nAnswer: A&amp;B: \"Support\" &amp; \"Heal\".", "answer": "C: smooth skin"}

Choices:  B: cotton C: reeds D: wood E: birch\nRationales:1. The problem statement includes two independent clauses which each have at least one word or phrase that refers to the context of the first clause.\n2. 'B: cotton', 'C: reeds', 'D: wood', and 'E: birch' are the objects mentioned in both clauses in the same order.\n3. Since each clause refers to a different object, the answer is the appropriate item that can be found in one clause but not the other.\n4. Therefore, the answer would be 'B: cotton'.\nAnswer: B: cotton\n\nInput: An orangutang is an animal not a person. If it was a person it would be what? Choices: A: a king B: a queen C: a prince D: a princess E: a prince and a princess\nRationales:\n1. The problem statement is asking us for the potential identity of an orangutang and the reason behind the same.\n2. Since the sentence structure implies that an orangutang is not a person, we can infer from this that it has to be something else.\n3. Consider all the possible options listed - 'A: a king', 'B: a queen', 'C: a prince', 'D: a princess', and 'E: a prince and a  princess'. The first four options are possible identities for the non-person item.\n4. Now, let's analyze the reason for the exclusion of the fifth option.\n5. Orangutangs are also not typically \"a prince and a princess\", as this implies two distinct individuals in one.\n6. Thus the answer is, option 'B: a queen'.\n7. We see that the reason for excluding it was also the possible answer and therefore the correct one. Thus, the answer is 'B: a queen.\nAnswer", "answer": "D: cupboard"}
{"text": "hands. \n7. Finally, we realize this is almost a trick question since this isn't an easy choice but the obvious answer could just be 'A: outside'.\n8. To eliminate 'A: outsiide', consider that the word 'outside' can also mean to be outside. In this case, we may be using an outdoor area as a base to begin the upward climbing.\n9. However, even this may not be the most direct answer since climbing up a mountain is still not necessarily what the question asks.\n10. Thus, even while 'outside' is a perfectly valid answer, the correct answer remains 'tree'.\nAnswer: E: tree\n\nInput: What does someone get a new car? Choices:  B: motor vehicle C: motor car D: car E: vehicle\nRationales:1. The question is about what is obtained through an action of new car purchase.\n2. Option D: car, is the correct answer because:\n3. When a person purchases a car, and it's new and therefore unused, then they get or acquire a car.\n4. \"Get\" can refer to both actions of acquiring something or receiving something from another. In this question, it's clear that the focus is on receiving something from someone else, so D: car is the best option.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: My little sister always likes to spend time outside. She plays what games? Choices:  D: baseball D: bowling D: volleyball D: softball\nRationales:   1. The question is describing what games my little sister likes to play while outside.\n2. The term 'play outside' indicates that a game is supposed to be the correct answer.\n3. From the choices, we can deduce that if she likes playing it outside, it's not a sport like football or basketball. Therefore, the only sports options left are'softball' and 'volleyball'.\n4. My little sister's age may have an impact on her inclination towards these two sports, as they tend to be more popular among older people.\n5. However, based on the provided choice, we see that the options are all games that she can potentially play outside such as D: softball, D: bowling, and D: volleyball.\n6.

Choices: A: 300 B: 100 C: 200 D: 3 months E: 1 year\nRationales: From the provided question, it is clear that the old mansion referred to a building, rather than an object. Therefore, we can eliminate the term 'old' from the word choices. From the remaining word choices, we can eliminate '100 B', '300 B', and '200 D' as they do not contain the number '300'. Moreover, the answer choices should contain the specific word'mansion'. Hence, we can eliminate 'A: 300' and 'E: 1 year'. Since the options should not be more than 100 years old, and since the numbers do not add up to 100, we can eliminate 'C: 200' and 'D: 3 months'. The options left are 'A: 3 months', 'E: 1 Year'. We can rule out'E: 1 Year' since it does not indicate the correct word choice. This leaves us with one answer of 'A: 3 Month'. According to the context given, the old mansion must be at least 3 months old.\n\nInput: The fish swims in salt water. A fish that does not swim very fast will typically what? Choices: A swim faster by using its wings B: dive deep to the ocean floor C: stay still in one place D: move to the fresh water E: feed on other fish\nRationales: The question states that the fish swims in saltwater (B). We can exclude'stay still' and 'dive deep to the ocean' \nbecause a fish cannot'stay still,' as that would inevitably lead to its death, and a fish cannot 'dive deep' since it cannot breathe without a need for water. Of the remaining choices, 'feed on other fish,' cannot be correct, as feeding on other fish would be a hologram. The remaining choice must therefore be'move to the freshwater.'\n\n---\n\n### Answer the following multiple choice question\n\nTo learn more about [Multiple", "answer": "C: battlefield"}

Choices: A: inside B: out C: barking D: biting E: jumping\nRationales:   1. The question revolved around a situation where a woman had asked the dog owner about her dog.\n2. The dog owner and the woman met in a park or some place outdoors and the woman had asked about the dog.\n3. The dog owner then told her about her dog and that she was friendly and the woman responded with what?\n4. To ascertain the correct answer, we need to understand the exact situation and then analyze the available words to find one that logically fits.\n5. To get more insight on who the two people are and the context of the discussion, we can say that the dog owner was with her dog in a park.\n6. Furthermore, it was not in front of a house or some other shelter because the woman described looking out and seeing the dog with the dog owner.\n7. The dog owner had previously mentioned her dog was friendly and then went on to explain how she's very jolly, which would imply the dog was actually in the park with her.\n8. Finally, the woman then asked where her dog was. In this situation, 'inside' and 'out' can not be correct choices; this is because it is likely a park and not the house of the dog owner. Moreover, we also know the dog was in the park. The question does not mention looking 'inside the dog's house' so, options A: inside B: outside are out.\n9. Since we know the dog was in a park, the options C: barking, D: biting, and E: jumping can not be the right answer because it implies that the dog could be resting, not in the park.\n10. The only logical answer as a response from the woman would be D: biting.\nAnswer: D barking\n\nInput: \"Hey bro, you can get in the van if you want, but I'm not sure if we can make it into the city.\" The brother replied what?

Choices:  Making clothes or shoes Choices:  A. Fishing B. Painting C. Digging D Building E. Teaching\nRationales: From the question the following factors were considered:\n1. The question includes the statement of the 'animal' 'otter'.\n2. The next word 'best' indicates to the 'behavioural' best-suited of the answer choices.\n3. The questions ask about the 'type' of work 'they' may 'do'\n4. The question ends with 'best suits their qualities:\n5. This shows that the otter works do not suit them and we need the answer which works best suits their abilities and their 'qualities', in this case, their behaviour.\n6. From the answer options, the otter is a fishing animal, that means if they find food in the water then they can catch it by fishing and eat it.\n7. They can also make use of baskets to capture fish as shown in otters and sharks videos.\n8. Now if the question is about the 'behaviour' of otters and what works best suits these creatures as a 'behaviour' than otters can adapt to both conditions of water and land.\n9. In this case, otters can do shoes or clothes because this can be done or made in water and for making shoes and clothes, these animals can move forward and backwards both underwater and land. Now if all other options are ruled out then the answer would have to be 'B. Painting'\n10. The otter will use their paws to make paints and art items and if their paws are dipped in paint then they can throw it on paper to make art.\n11. This is an example of an otter using his or her behaviour to make art. This will also depend on where you live because otters live in water so some of the choices are ruled out because the work of'making' clothes or shoes", "answer": "E: farmer's market"}
{"text": "characteristic of using their hands.\n7. We can also account for the words 'can' and 'be found'.\n8. The term \"be found\" indicates the existence or presence of something.\n9. Given that the question states that Marmots can \"be found in high places\", we can infer that the options available to account for this are all places where Marmots are physically found. \n10. This inference is supported by the wording \"can\" which pertains to ability. Given the fact that all the options are real places that Marmots can actually be found, we can eliminate other unsuitable responses and answer the question by picking 'tree'.\nInput: In the north pacific, a giant group of whales can be found.  Where is that place? Choices: 1: B 2: A 3: E 4: D 5: C\nRationales: The question mentions whales in the north pacific.\n1. The Pacific Ocean contains the north and south pacific region.\n2. Whales often are located in the north pacific waters because they reproduce faster in warmer waters.\n3. Therefore, we can narrow down our answer to north pacific.\n\nInput: There was a whale shark sighting in a port city.  What was the port city? Choices: 8: B 7: E 6: A 5: D 4: C 3: D 2: E 1: C\nRationaleses: The question states that there was a sighting of a whale shark in a port city.\n1. A port is a city that contains a deep water port or ocean pier.\n2. There are five main types of ports: passenger port,cruise port, cargo port, transshipment port, and special port.\n3. A passenger port is for the purpose of loading and unloading of passengers and their cargo.\n4. A cruise port is for the purpose for loading and unloading of cruises and their passengers.\n5. A cargo port is for the loading and unloading of cargo.\n6. A transshipment port is for use to transfer goods to other nations.\n7. A special port is used for specific purposes.\n8.

Choices:  (  ) A: damp B: wet C: cold D: waterlogged E: frozen\nRationales:1. The problem statement denotes lots of things that are iced and will cause the user to be in a messy state.\n2. The given options include A: damp, wet, cold, waterlogged, and frozen.\n3. Damp means slightly wet and not necessarily very moist or very damp.\n4. There is no mention of water anywhere else in the sentence so we can eliminate that choice.\n5. Cold doesn't tell us how moist or damp the stuff is, merely stating it's cold, which isn't the entire story.\n6. Waterlogged indicates that wet something is too wet, so we can discount that too.\n7. This leaves frozen.\nAnswer: Frozen\n\nInput: To achieve peace of mind, what do you need?

Choices: A: honey bees B: small insects C: worms D: owls E: acorns\nRationales: The problem asks us which of the given species of trees are most likely to have holes filled with honey bees. The question refers to a tree where other parts of it are filled with another organism. So, if a forest is filled with trees and some of them have holes filled with small insects, it doesn't necessarily mean that those are the ones with holes filled with honey. The same applies to the other species being mentioned in the question. There are many species of trees whose holes are filled with honey, and it is most likely to be one of those species only based on the context that the forest is mostly filled with such trees. We can eliminate all except one option. So, the correct option is E: acorns because all the others are less likely to be filled with honey bee holes like acorns.\nAnswer : E : acorns", "answer": "A: botanical garden"}

The problem states that \"the woman in the yellow rain coat is a what,\" suggesting this statement refers to a profession.\n2. While there are other items the woman in the yellow rain jacket could be referred to as, we need to determine which of them is a profession.\n3. From the given choice of professions, two of them, 'a reporter' and 'a business person' are valid options that refer to people in a profession.\n4. Therefore, the question can be rephrased as \"From the given choice, which one is a professional?\"\n5. We can eliminate 'A: a journalist' as a valid profession because there is no job description or type of personality that indicates being a journalist.\n6. This is further proven by other choice options that directly do not match the profession of a journalist.\n7. We can eliminate 'B: a sales rep' by confirming that it's not an appropriate profession that could be bestowed upon the chosen woman in the yellow rain gear.\n8. This leaves us with 'C: a business manager' and 'D: a reporter'.\n9. It should be noticed that 'C: a business manger' clearly aligns itself with the description of the person in the rain gear with a direct reference to a profession that she is.\n10. In contrast, 'D: a repoter' cannot be used as a proper noun for a profession.\n11.

If we have a value for one quantity and want to calculate another quantity, we can determine that value using these types of problems.\n3. There's no need to be afraid, just focus on doing the problem.\n4. We start by identifying units that are similar to what we already know. \n5.

We can determine one fact about the sentence from the word choice of \"a little.\"\n\t\t3. Using that information, we can eliminate some of the options that don't align with the word choice of \"little\" in the context. So, we should not consider B: proud, C: bossy, or E: brave.\n\t\t4. However, while A: timid and D: humble fit the clue that the girl is \"little\", using that information and logic would result in an incorrect response.\n\t\t5. For instance, \"she was a little timid, but not entirely.\" would not make sense.\n\t\t6. Therefore, we are left with B: proud and A: timid.\n\t\t7. Logically, we can discard \"A: timid\" as the correct answer because it is more fitting for a proud young girl to be described as \"timid\" rather than \"proud.\"\n\t\t8.

It's a reasonable question, assuming that dogs and pigs can't swim and can't climb, then what's true about all of these?\n2. Let us consider the statements.\n\n* i: All statements that start with, 'they swim', must be true.\n* ii: All statements that start, 'they can climb', must be true. Therefore, it must be false.\n* iii: All statements that start like, 'they can swim', must be false.\n3. Thus, based on the statements that are true, or false, and the characteristics of the animals, we can be certain that statement iv: They can climb is wrong. This is one of the answers we can pick as the correct response.\n\nAnswer: iv: They can climbn't\n\nInput: What is a common theme of the music in the movies 'The Notebook'? Choices: 1. violins 2. piano 3. a melancholy story 4. a love triangle\nRationales:\nIt is an entertaining movie and when something amusing happens in the story, it's likely to receive a lively soundtrack. This could be a violin, piano, or any other instrument. Music is selected to accompany the plot or action, depending on the requirements.\n\nFortunately, there is an official soundtrack of \"The Notebook.\" The most striking characteristic here are the violins. They play the lead, and the majority of the music is made of them. The soundtrack even includes a song, \"There you'll Be,\" which is performed entirely with violins.\n\nA piano would be the next option because it's an instrument played in some of the music that isn't composed exclusively of violins.\n\nThe final option, a \"love triangle,\" is the most", "answer": "C: baseball stadium"}

The choices are all the locations mentioned that could have the network down.\n4. The choices are: A: apartment, B: office, C: restaurant, and D: hotel.\n5.

'Outside' is also not the right choice because it does not refer to a specific environment which is the main constraint of finding the most accurate answer.\n10. Therefore, considering the remaining two choices with 'hands', 'jungle' and 'tree', we can eliminate 'jungle' because there is nothing in the jungle that we know for sure can be climbed or scaled with hands.\n11. We can also eliminate 'tree' since trees do not need the use of hands to climb, so this is not the correct answer.\n12.

Choices: A: on the run B: climbing C: in hiding D: hiding E: on the ground\nRationales: This question revolves around the description of a particular monkey.\n1. Generally, monkeys are in the class of primates which implies that they can be found in tropical rain forests.\n2. The statement refers to the monkeys that are specifically 'the toughest'.\n3. Considering this, it's safe to guess that it refers to the type of monkeys, in this case, the gorilla who, by association, may be in areas like Africa.\n4. The choice 'on the run' implies fast movement, which the gorilla isn't known for. \n5. Similarly, the choice 'climbing' implies some sort of vertical movement that the gorillas are not known to exhibit.\n6. We can cross out options B, C, and D since they do not match the criteria.\n7. This reduces the number of options to two and the only viable choice remaining is A: 'on the run'.\nAnswer: A: on the ground\n\nInput: When we need something done that isn't being done, we often reach out to a what?  Choices:  A. handyman B. contractor C. friend D. boss  E. lawyer\nRationales: We need to look at the sentence structure to identify what it's implying.\n1. The sentence is introducing a list of people, beginning with the 'handyman', 'contractor', 'friend', 'boss',  and 'lawyer'.\n2. The sentence continues with a phrase that says we'reach out to'.\n3. In this case, \"reach out\" implies that we have a problem.\n4. The specific problem is that something isn't being done we have to do.\n5. Thus, we can ascertain that the phrase 'we reach out to' indicates that we need to resolve or attend to something.\n6. However, as this is a choice task, we can't just guess at the best answer.\n7.

Choices: A: raindrop B: sand C: leaves D: soil E: wind\nRationales:\n1. The girl wanted to play with something. This has to do with the game or activity she wanted to do, as opposed to the actual thing she wanted to collect or hold.\n2. The weather could be relevant to her activity, leading to her desire to find rain, snow, or wind.\n3. However, her activity is in the present tense, which suggests that it's not actually raining, and thus rain does not factor for her activity.\n4. So she wants to play with something, but the weather is not a relevant condition.\n5. She may want to collect or hold things that are related to the weather.\n6. She may also be talking about the activities that can be done on a rainy day with her friends.\n7. She may also be relating to items that can be used to play in any weather.\n8. All of the remaining word options are in fact relating to things that one can play with, or elements that make things like snow, wind, waves, or rain.\n9. This indicates that the object the girl wants to play with could be related to, but is not necessarily related to, one of the given options.\n10. Therefore, the most fitting answer, from the choices listed below, is 'B: sand'.\nAnswer: B: sand\n\nInput: A person may like to do a lot of things but they always do at least one. What do people always do? Choices: A. Work B. Eat C. Play D. Fight E. Talk\nRationales: The question specifies that a person always does at least one of the activities. The context of the question implies that the activities need to be general in nature.\n1. Choice 'A': 'Work' is general and people may often engage in doing work in some capacity.\n2. Choice 'B': 'Eat' is general and people like to eat.\n3. Choice 'C': 'Play' is general and people enjoy doing it.\n4.

From which she loves looking at what? Choices: A: her father B: the sunset C: the stars D: the view\nRationales:1. The given expression talks about the girl who often hangs out in high places.\n2. Thus, she must have friends somewhere in her vicinity that she can hang out with. \n3. This would mean that 'outside' and'hill' are wrong choices because they neither imply nor show the presence of a friend for the girl.\n4. Similarly, 'jungle' and 'rocky hillside'.\n5. Therefore, to identify the place where the girl hangs out, we should be looking for potential friends, rather than locations.\n6. However, we also know that the girl is often seen looking at the 'view'.\n7. Since she is known to hang out in some high places, one of her friends must be high enough for someone to have a view.\n8. In fact, the friend 'inside' may not be in the view of the girl, but that she is still high enough for the girl to see the 'view'.\n9. Therefore, we can deduce that the friend the girl hangs out with is 'inside' since she is able to see the 'view' of the friend. This would be the case if her friend were 'on the roof' of a building.\n10. So, based on this and the clues provided in the questions, the answer is option A: inside.\nAnswer: A : inside\n\nInput: The boy had many friends in the town.

If you had to describe the pizza with another word, which would be used? Choices: \nA: tasty B: delicious C: fast D: salty E: sweet F: spicy G: simple H: flat I: dough\nRationales:\n1. The sentence is about pizza and whether one type of pizza is the same as another specific type of pizza.\n2. The sentence provides information about the specific types that the pizza is being compared to, so we don't need to guess or guesswork to figure out which types. \n3. Of the four answers, only 'tasty' and 'fast' are close enough to fit our definition of pizza. \n4. 'Salting','sweet', and'spicy' do not fit our definition because they are flavors or descriptors that refer to ingredients and toppings, not the pizza itself.\n5. 'Delicious' is the other answer that could be a suitable description for the specific type of pizza, but it does not give us enough information to determine the type.\n6. Therefore we can conclude that 'tasty' is the best answer.\nAnswer: A B Tasty\n\n### Instructions: \nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n### Input: I've been to Italy.

While the question talks about a crab moving to cover its territory it doesn\u2019t talk about the direction in which it has to move to cover it.\nB. If one examines the given options, the options \u2018mountain\u2019 and \u2018desert\u2019 are not the terrains where a crab moves.\nC.

According to the above explanation \u2018b\u2019 is the correct answer.\nE. As frog and crab both have the same habitat, frog moves in desert, grassland, and mountain but it doesn\u2019t move in forest and aquatic.\nF.

Choices: A: noon B: seven C: morning D: midnight E: five\nRationales: The situation described is when you should avoid wearing white.  We need to determine the correct context to the situation.\n1. If we examine the options,'morning' is used as time of day without giving anything more specific.\n2. Further, the phrase \"after what\" implies there is another context or a specific event that triggers the warning, which isn't mentioned.\n3. The only option that fits this description is'midnight' because midnight is a time of day where something occurs after something happens.\n4. At this time of night, one might be at a party or other celebration and, typically, party-goers would dress casually and typically not wear white.\n5. Thus, the warning to avoid wearing white is after midnight, so the answer is D: midnight.\nAnswer: D. midnight\n\n### Instructions\nWrite a response that appropriately addresses the issue described in the prompt.\n\n### Prompt\n### Demonstraion:\nThe restaurant is known for its delicious coffee, but the service isn't quite as good.

The common belief that coffee should be served hot is a myth based on the historical roots of coffee as a beverage and people often don\u2019t appreciate what else coffee can be.

We can eliminate options that don't involve bacteria such as \"antibacterial lotion\".\n2. We also know that a scientist is probably focused on bacteria.\n3. Furthermore, the choices suggest certain types of research, such as \"bacteria bacteria\", \"bacterial virus strain\", and \"bacteria\".\n4.

Choices:  B: outside A: backyard B: garden C: shed D: porch\nRationales:\n1. The question asks where a man can find hoses.\n2. We know that a hose is something you can attach to a spigot to provide running water.\n3. The available choices help us narrow our options.\n4. 'B: outside' is not a suitable answer because, based on the description, a hose is not directly attached to an outside source.\n5. 'A: backyard' could be a potential answer because backyards have water spigots, which can be linked to hoses.\n6. However, it could also be argued that 'backyards' are not outside of the property, and therefore excluded from being the correct answer.\n7. Finally, 'C: shed' is a possible answer because sheds can house a hose and have a spigot attached to them.\n8. Therefore, the final answer is 'C: shed'.\nAnswer: C: shed\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.", "answer": "A: school"}

Considering the context, we can infer that the friend tried to find what was causing the problem.\n3. We can eliminate C, D, and E because they are the exact things being sought, so they're the answer.\n4. The other options A, B, and F are not the correct answer for the two main reasons below:\n     - B: issue doesn't mean cause but rather the content of a problem.\n       - For example, \"What is the issue with this machine?\"\n       - This implies one is looking for what the problem is, not the cause of it. \n     - C: challenge is not about solving or finding a problem.\n       Challenges in general imply a task or situation we must do or go through. \n     - E: difficulty doesn't mean solving a problem for it's something subjective like having an opinion so it cannot be found.\n  4.

Choices:  P: dawn B: evening C: afternoon D: sunset E: night\nRationales: Considering the phrase \"looks to the east\", we must note that an animal is looking in a specific direction relative to it's position.\n1. Therefore, it can only be seeing what occurs during a certain time of the day.\n2. From the given options, only three of them are related to times of day: dawn, afternoon, and night.\n3. In this case, animals (not including humans) do not typically see twilight or dawn (unless they're a nocturnal species) because these aren't specific times of the day.\n4. The same is true for seeing sunset, for which animals (again, not including humans) do not generally have a dedicated time on which they focus their sight.\n5. However, the term \"afternoon\" is defined as being roughly 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. in the standard 24-hour time system.\n6. So, if a creature was looking to the east, and the afternoon was defined as roughly 12 a.m. to 2 p.m., it would be nighttime in the creature's perception.\n7.

Analyzing the sentence structure, sentence \"If there is a problem with cake why is it in the fridge?\" has 2 major subparts. i. \"with cake\" implies that there is a problem with something, and that thing is cake, not problem itself. and ii. problem, in reference to the context of cake, must be refrigerated since refrigeration of food items is the most common and conventional method to address problem.  Rationales II: \"It's placed in the fridge to stop it from becoming what?\" implies that item in fridge is cake which is placed in fridge to stop it becoming mouldy, and cake's being placed is reason of this sentence.  Hence, the options here are I: it might be placed in refrigerator to keep it cool and II:It's placed in refrigerated to avoid it becoming mouldy. Only one of them is grammatically correct.  So, the question is I. It might be refrigerator to stop it from becoming too hot.  Therefore, the answer is a:  It might be refridgerated to stop it from getting hot.\nAnswer: A. It might be placed there to keep it cool\n\nInput: I am sick due to my consumption of what? Choices  I: fruit juice II: tea III: alcohol IV: coffee V: chocolate\nRationales: The phrase 'due to' implies that someone has an ailment because of an ingested item, rather than an ingesting item itself.\nSo, it is important to look at the subject or what the user consumed, and evaluate its impact on the health.\nSince the question mentions 'due to' and not 'cause by', the answer has to be of a type that results in ailment.\nAnd since the health ailment is described as sickness, the correct answer is going to be a thing having the capacity", "answer": "B: melting"}

Choices: 1) B: so we had less to invent something 2) C: so they had less to invent and work with new ideas 3) C: so we had less people 4) E: So the technology existed and it could not be invented 5) E: We had more space to make things and people to test them with  Rationales:  1. Firstly, it is important to analyze the context of the question. While it is true that the number of people may lead to less innovation, it is also important to note that the question is focused on the \"recent\" past, where population growth has been rapid and significant. This implies that it is unlikely that population would be a major factor in the lack of technology.\n2. We need to focus on two key elements of what is being explained. \n2.1. The fact that new tech has been developed in relatively recent years. The question is explicitly mentioning lack of technology in a recent past. \n2.2. The inference that people are getting smarter or better as opposed to working with limited resources.\n3. Consider this, if the population were actually a major factor driving the lack of innovation, why have large populations developed a relatively advanced civilization recently? It makes more sense if the newest developments were due to recent innovations. \n4. Looking at the options, it is likely that E: so we had more space to make and test new tech is the explanation. \n5. The argument here is that the population has been continuously growing for a reasonably lengthy period of time and there hasn't been any substantially huge advancements in technology. \n6. Hence, the answer should be E: so humans had more space and time to make tech.\nAnswer: E. humans had more space and more time to make technology\n\nInput: What would you do if there was a tornado that had a radius of twelve kilometers and came from direction nine?

Thus, the most appropriate choice is 'tree'.\nAnswer: E: tree\n\nInput: We can say, \"this is a very tall tree.\" In what manner do the two words \"very\" and \"tall\" qualify each other? Choices: 1. They describe different, opposing qualities 2. they are both describing positive qualities to the tall tree 3. They are both describing negative qualities to the tall  tree 4. They are both describing comparitive qualities to the tall trees 5. Both are positive attributes (highly, very, extremely) \nRationales:  1. Both \"very\" and \"Tall\" modifies the description. We can assume that there is a tall tree, and it must be tall. The comparison does nothing. There is no positive or negative nature to the adjective, and there is also no comparison. 2. A more accurate description is \"We can say, 'This is a very tall tree' in what manner do the two adjectives \"very\" and \"extraordinarily\" qualify each other?\"\n3. A more accurate description would be the following: \"We can say, \"this  is a very tall tree.' Both \"very\" and  \"tall\" qualifiy the tree. There is no comparison to two things, there is simply the description is that \"it is very tall.\"\n4. There is no comparison here.  This is not a comparative adjective.\n5. Both \"very, extremely, or highly\" are positive qualifiers (i.e. positive attributes) that are used to describe a quality. The words themselves are describing how the tree is more than just tall, they describe that it is exceptionally tall. This should be removed because it is inaccurate.\nAnswer: 2.  They are both describing positive qualities to the tall tree.\n\n### Exercise:\n\n### Task:\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: A beagle can run fast and long. Where do you find them?

Choices:  B: rugby C: basketball D: baseball E: tennis\nRationales: The question asks to choose the most popular sport in the given region.\n1. First, note the keywords 'here' and'region'. These terms imply that the sport's popularity is assessed within a geographical area.\n2. From available options, it is evident that B: rugby and E: tennis have been excluded based on this information because both the sports have global followership.\n3. Basketball is popular in urban regions while rugby is popular in many rural and suburban areas. Similarly, baseball is primarily played in North America and is more popular in rural and suburban areas compared to urban environments.\n4. Thus D: baseball is suitable for the given context.\nAnswer: D : baseball\n\nInput: What did she leave at the hospital? Choices:  C: a child E: a young woman D: a teenager B: a newborn F: a baby\nRationales: There are 5 options given in the choices - A, B, C, D, E\nThe question is asking to choose what she left at the hospital.\n1. A: cannot be left at the hospital, as the hospital is not a place where the baby was born.\n2. B: cannot be left at a hospital.\n3. C: A young woman cannot be left at the Hospital. She would be already present or gone.\n4. D: A teenager cannot be left at the Hosptial (same explanation as C).\n5. E: A newborn can be left at the Hospital because it is born there.

Choices:  B: carnivore C: vegetarian D: herbivore E: fish\nRationales: This question requires us to find out what category a bear typically falls into.\n1. Bear is a large mammal that lives everywhere (many places).\n2. Generally speaking, a large mammal would be categorized as an animal belonging to a 'herbivorous' or 'carnivorous' class.\n3. A bear does not look like an herbivore because it hunts prey to eat. It looks like and acts like something that belongs to a carnivorous class.\n4. Hence the correct answer is B: carnivores.\nAnswer: B&nbsp; : carnivore\n\nInput: Why might an arctic marine need to travel far? Choices:  D: the wind blows in a different direction each day B: air conditioning breaks C: food runs out E: the temperature is too cold F: seawater levels are low\nRationales: The questions relates to an arctic marine that needs to travel far. One important reason for this is because _________________.\n1. We can infer the answer by understanding the context of what makes a marine travel far in an arctic region.\n2. A marine has to journey a long distance to get the wind, which should be blowing in a different direction eachday.\n3. The question points at the importance of the wind's movement for a marine to embark on its travel.\n4. The wind in arctic seas is the main source of the marine's commute.\n5.

A: the third brother 2. B: the second brother 3. C: the second brother 4. D: the youngest brother 5. E: the oldest brother\nRationales: The choices 'A: the third brother' and 'B: the second brother' are incorrect because they are not the only person the eldster doesn't see. 1. If it\u2019s the third brother then the second brother exists and therefore they would both be the eldest's only person he's don't see. 2. The same is true for the second brother because the eldest doesn'ts see the second brother and therefore also sees the third brother. 3. The choice 'C: the second brother' is also incorrect because the second brother is the only person the elder doesn't see. The other two brothers exist and therefore the third brother is also seen by the elder. 4. The choice 'D: the youngest brother' is incorrect because the youngest brother has no connection to the elder which means the youngster doesn't exist to be seen and therefore the elder is not the only person he doesn't see. This same logic is true for the choice 'E: the oldest brother' because while the old brother exists the elder sees him. 5.

The question is asking about where you can get a job that pays you less than usual.\n3. Looking at the answers, \"More\" and \"C\", both options are most feasibly inapplicable to this context because you would want to earn more money not less.\n4. Similarly, \"D\" and \"E\", these answer options are too nonsensical to be considered plausible in the scenario.\n5.

Find an object of the similar size B: Cut out the piece of cloth C: Glue the cloth on to the hole D: Plug the hole with some sort of wood E: Tape the cloth all around the hole\nRationales: The question is asking about how to repair a tire, so we assume it contains a hole.\n1. Generally, a tire's hole cannot be repaired with an object of the same size as the tire. It would not be of sufficient size to cover the hole.\n2. Cutting out a piece of cloth that is similar to the tire size would not be feasible because tires are not often made of fabric.\n3. Likewise, gluing this new piece to the hole would not result in a repaired tire either since the object lacks adhesive.\n4. Also, plugging a hole with some sort of a wood would not be sufficient since it wouldn't fill the hole in its entirety.\n5. Finally, taping the piece of cloth all around the hole would likely not fit snugly around the hole either but would be too loose to cover it completely.\n6.

Choices: \n* A: wash dishes\n* B: shave\n* C: hang a painting\n* D: pick up a glass\n* E: carry a box\nRationales:\n1. An essential step in working through this problem statement is to examine the context of the words. One way to do this is to ask oneself: \"What does the 'question' actually mean?\".\n2. To answer this question, each option needs to be analyzed with regards to the description of the task given.\n3. If the task is about \"completing it with your hands\", some of the options provided are not suitable as they don't require the use of hands in their completion.\n4. For example \"Carrying a box\" does not require using hands to move it. The same is true for \"picking up a glass\". \n5. Therefore, \"Carrying a Box\" and \"Picking Up a Glass\" would be excluded.\n\n6. The options left would fall into two types of tasks, those involving manual labor and those not.\n7. This provides two different ways to approach the problem.\n8. We can either first determine the task type (manually labor intensive or not) and then match the options for the correct one to exclude, or we can begin with removing the options that do not require the use of hands until we only get two that are either both labor intensive or both not.\n9. This second approach is more efficient and therefore, it will be followed for completing the task.\n10. If not, the first approach will be used.\n11. To begin with, we can eliminate \"wash dishes\", \"shave\", and \"hang a painting\" because none involve the use of hands, so these will be thrown out.\n12. From here, we use the other question to be answered to remove two options from each of the remaining categories \"Carrying a Glass\" and \"Carrying a Book\".\n13. From there, we can eliminate the other options quickly since any will fall under one of the types we have already excluded.\n14. For instance, \"", "answer": "B: heart attacks"}

Choices: A: alive B: tasty C: overripe D: unsuited E: expensive\nRationales: The question is about whether \"crab meat\" at a \"seafood market\" is fresh or not.\n\n1. There is a need to understand the context of crab meat being fresh. We must analyze the given options to see which one is the most suitable.\n2. Among choices A, B, C, D, and E, B and C should be eliminated as they are irrelevant to \"freshness\".\n3. Although A is true about \"alive\", it is not specific to \"fresh\" given the context of a \"seafoood market\".\n4. Also, since the phrase is \"Fresh or a lot of crab...\", D is not the correct answer.\n5. \"Unripe\" could be another term to refer to the product being inedible, but would not necessarily connote freshness.\n6. Thus E is likely the best option. The term \"expensive\" fits in the context of the question which was, \"lot of crab (meat) at seafood market\".  Because it's expected that the seafood market would typically have lots of crab, it is safe to assume that they would have cheap (not expensive) prices. If the crab meat were more expensive, it would seem like a mark up on an expensive product; this would not fit in with the question.\n7.\"Fresh\" suggests that the crab meat is untainted by exposure to heat and dangers.

Choices:  (A) A-L-M-A (B) O-L-M-E (C) A-L-D-M-E (D) E-R-M-L-A (E) T-L-M-S-E\nRationales: The problem statement, at the minimum, contains two words, scrupulous and sounds, whose meanings must align.\nThese words are also spelled similarly.\nBecause of these factors, we can analyze the question as a spelling-like question with a two-step solution procedure.\n\n1. Determine the spelling of'scrupulous'.\n2. Determine the meaning of'scrupulously'.\n3. Compare the results of these two steps.\n\n**Step 1:**  To determine the spelling of scrupulous.\nConsider all the possible permutations and combinations of the alphabets in scrupulous. This yields a total of \\(96\\) possibilities.\nThe permutations and combinations of two letters in a sequence yields a total of \\(72\\) possibilities.\nThus, this gives us a total of \\(168\\) possibilities.\nThis was the process to arrive at the result above.\n\nSimilarly, if you were to spell a sentence, then you would go through the same process.\n\nSo in the given scenario, we are attempting to spell/find out the spelling of'sounds'.\nTo find out the spelling of sounds which is sounds, we have to go through the steps mentioned above.\n\nThus, we can eliminate choices (A), (B) and (C) because'sound' doesn't match with the word'scrupules'.

Since the meal came out great, it's safe to assume that the spices and ingredient combinations used worked very well together.\n4. A'store', 'warehouse', and 'kitchen' do not sound that impressive.\n5. These options describe places where ingredients are often readily available.\n6. Moreover, a 'warehouse' is used to describe large stores of good that may even take up a storehouse or warehouse.\n7. This speaks to availability in large quantities as opposed to the \"finest\" or most high-quality ingredients.\n8. A store and pantry are also similar to each other. In the case of'store', it usually implies that the ingredients were bought off and not taken from the kitchen. \n9. Thus, all these options would not be suitable for the meal, as the 'finest' implications would not be consistent. The ingredients used would need to be high quality.\n10. The kitchen is also not very suitable as it is unlikely to have acquired a large quantity of the finest ingrediants.\n11. Since the meal was successful in coming out as great as it did, the implication is that a large quantity of the very best ingredients was used to prepare it. \n12. Therefore, the best place where the meal came from is the'spice shop' as it is a location where the chef is likely to have acquired and sourced the most expensive and", "answer": "E: produce"}

Choices:  B: baker  C: restaurateur D: chef E: server\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about people who cannot cook, where they work and where they play.\n2. This implies there is a set of people who can cook and another set of people who cannot and we need to look for their common characteristics.\n3. The only thing these two sets share is the activity - cooking.\n4. Therefore, the people who cannot cook are the ones who do not carry out that activity, which means they are people with other occupations.\n5. One such occupation that typically does not involve cooking is serving.\n6. Therefore we go with Answer E: server.\nAnswer: E, Server\n\nInput: A cactus is found in which of the following places? Choices: A B C D Answer: E\nRationales: Considering the choice E: All of the above: C, H, I, P, S\n1. In the context of a cactus, the word 'which' denotes location.\n2. Therefore, \"a cactus\" refers to a specific cacti, \"is\" indicates some activity related to this cactus, and \"found in\" refers to the place where the cactus activity takes place, i.e. the location.\n3. Consider the given options. \"C\": cannot be the place because a cactus cannot be found in the category C of \"car\".\n4. \"H\": heat is not the location of the cactus; it is a condition under which the cactus exists.\n5. \"I\": in the category 'I' \"is found\" can have multiple locations. For example, information can be \"found\" in a book or in a computer or on the internet.\n6. \"P\": in the category 'P' cannot be the location because a \"place\" is not found in \"Parking\".\n7. \"S\": in the category S can be the location in which a cactus is found because the category has places in it.

Hence the correct answer is E: tree.\nAnswer: E. tree.\n\n\n### Challenge:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Instruction:Answer the question as indicated.\n\n## Demonstartion:\nIf you use a sponge when you wash the table and then use a sponge to wash you hands, how are you _______ the table? Choices: \nA: cleaning the bacteria off the table\nB: removing food particles from the surface\nC: destroying the mold that is present\nD: scrubbing any dirt from the table\nE: taking out the dirt that is underneath the legs of the table\nThe correct answer is C. We can eliminate A, B, and D because we are not _______ the table with a sponge, we are cleaning it by use of this sponge tool. From the list of options, only D and E _______ the surface of the table, so we can remove E and choose C as the correct answer.\n\n## Rationale:\nThe key word to decipher in the question is \"table\". Our objective is to ascertain what type of cleaning is being performed on the table: cleaning, scrubbing, washing, removing, or taking. The other objects in the question are not involved in the actual washing and the word \"sponge\" is the only reference to a cleaning tool. This indicates that we need to focus on just the table.\n\nWe need to determine if we are cleaning, scrubing, removing, washing, or taking the dirt/bacteria/germs or any other kind of object with our sponge. This will answer what we are doing with our sponge, while leaving out all other entities.\n\nBased on this principle, we can further eliminate A and B as not referring to cleaning, scrub, remove, or wash actions.\n\nThe answer choices are as follows:\n\nA: cleaning = The sponge is used on the table to remove food particles and other unwanted things. Not relevant.\n\nB: removing = The sponge removes items from the table. The table does not require being washed or cleaned.\n\nC: washing = The sponge washes the", "answer": "E: rain forest"}

So, the answer choices would be 'hill' or 'tree'.\n9. We can further narrow down the options using the words 'jungle', and 'outside' to get a better idea of the correct answer.\n10. While Marmots could potentially be found in a jungle as explained in option D, jungles do not generally feature high areas. This is not appropriate as we need to get to a high or elevated place.\n11. Outside is the same, because outside isn't a high area and could even feature lowlands or other features at the lowest levels.\n12. However, 'rocky hillside is specifically about going to high places, and it could involve climbing with hands, which Marmots use.\"\n13.

C: a condo 4. D: a townhouse 5. E: an apartment\nRationales: Context: A single word question where the only options are cities (houses, condos, townhouses, and apartments). \n1. The sentence only describes 1 place out of the 5 options, and doesn't mention the word \"place\". The options are all cities, and are all similar. The only differences are which type of building the brother lives in. This context doesn't really allow for any of the places in the question to be used.\n2. If we assume that the answer is 3 C: a condo (therefore 2), the remaining places would have similar issues. The problem context doesn't allow us to use any of the places in option 1 A: a hut. They're all very similar, and as towns are considered \"places\", any place in the remaining three buildings is acceptable (2, 4, or 5).\n3. A town is not a \"building\" (either 1 or 2 apply to \"places\"). Therefore, the remaining three buildings must all be cities.\n4. A condo (choice 3) implies a building with several units, where the owner could be renting our using his property as a residence. This leaves us with either the remaining three \"town house\" options (4, 5, and 6). \n5. If we assume the answer is 2 townhouse (we will call the other condo and apartment condo, apartment), the remaining places would be similar, and therefore, also allow for any of the three remaining places as answers (4, 5 or 6).\n6. In both the solutions (3 and 5), neither the question nor all the options really make sense.\n7. Therefore both solutions are wrong.\nAnswer: None of these. The context only described 1 option (and didn't mention \"place\"). As such, none of the other places can be used as answers.

Thus, the answer is E: tree.\nAnswer: E. tree\n\nInput: What is a good location to put fish? Choices:  [A] [B] [C] [D]  A: kitchen B: lake C: reef D: pond\nRationales:1. From the given problem statement describing where it might be a good location to put some fish, it's natural to deduce that \"good\" refers to a suitable location or area to place fish.\n2. The term \"good\" is typically associated with a positive characteristic or positive feeling associated with what you're describing because \"good\" is always an adjective that precedes a noun.\n3. Consider the available choices given: kitchen, lake, reef, and pond. All of these are suitable locations that you would typically place fish in, which makes it unclear if the location is \"good\" or suitable.\n4. However A: kitchen and D: pond specifically imply a negative characteristic or negative feeling associated with the fact that you have fish in these locations.\n5. This is because we can infer that fish would not be a good choice for the kitchen because they would be a nuisance in that setting, making being a good location to put them in highly unlikely. \n6. Similarly, we can infer that fish are likely not an animal species you would want to keep in a pond because fish would be out competing for food or being eaten by those animals. \n7. In the first instance, the idea of \"good\" or suitable is contradicted by the statement itself. Likewise, it is contradicted by the second statement implying the nuisance or inconvenient nature of fish in the pond. Thus, the answer for that choice is D: pond.\n8. Similarly, considering B: lake, we know that there are many types of fish that reside in lakes and that we can likely find lakes that are well suited for keeping fish.\n9. Therefore, it is a suitable or good location to keep fish, so the answer for this choice is B: lake.\n10. This now rules out A: kitchen and C: reef and allows us to conclude that the", "answer": "E: eat plants"}

Choices:  B: reuse it to store water C: donate it D: use it in the garden E: use it for transport\nRationales: The problem statement says there are no restrictions, so the word \"you\" refers to the plural.\nThe options imply what a water tub could be used to do in some form of its material state.\n\n1. The meaning is clear in choice C (donate it) and D (use in the garden). However, E (use it for transport) is redundant because it implies using the old water tub in lieu of a vehicle.\n\n2. Thus, the sentence should be asking if old bathtubs could be used in some other way other than donating, for transport, or for the garden.\n\n3. Answer B: Reuse it to store water is vague in that it does not specify the material it is being placed in.\n 4. Furthermore, answer B implies filling the bathtub with something meaning the bathtub is not simply being placed inside something somewhere, but is actively reused to do work.\n5. This is clear in answer C (donate it). Choice C is the option to donate, which can mean the material will be used for some other function.\n6. Moreover, choice C has already specified what it will be used for. Reusing it to store the water does not change the fact it is being reused to store water.\n7. To further this, choice C already includes a verb. So, it is already indicating that the bathtub is reused and is being done in a form other than being filled with water.\n8. Since choice C is not clear or does not make sense, it is eliminated.\n9. In answer B, the bathtub can be reused not in the form of placing it somewhere, but by actually restoring liquid in it so it is reusable.  This indicates the bathtub can only exist in a condition that it be filled with water which is different from answer C.\n10. Answer A is eliminated because it does not involve using water, specifically reusing it to store water", "answer": "A: tree tops"}

'Lived in an apartment in the city and drove herself to work from her home in an apartment. Took a bus to work': If she needs to drive to her house to reach her work, then it means her house is outside her office building and she lives too far to walk to work.\n2. 'Lived in country and drove herself to school and took a taxi to work': If she drives herself to school, then she does not live far away from school. This means that the woman would have to drive a little distance to her work because she lives too far from the office building.\n3. 'Lives in country and takes bus and taxi to school on the way to work': This choice implies that the woman lives in country but her work is in city. Hence, she uses a bus to go school, and after studying, takes a taxi to go work.\n4. 'Lives in apartment and takes bus and a taxi on the way to and from work': This choice implies she lives in an apartment and her work is too far to walk, so she uses a bus and taxi on the way back home from work.\n5.

Choices: C: bicycle A: kayak B: jet skis D: surfer E: shark\nRationales: This sentence is very similar to the previous. The first thing is important to notice about the statement is that the phrase 'in a large body of water' implies that it's a water body. This does not necessarily mean that the water is an ocean; it could also be a pond, lake, or river.\n1. The question indicates that the body of water in question, with a 'large' area, is where something will have the ability to outcompete the'small' boat.\n2. If the water body is just a lake, river, or pond, the surfaced of the water is probably much smaller than the whole body of water, hence the difference isn't great enough to disqualify the boat.\n3. However, what can be found on larger bodies of water are boats that are bigger and faster than the one used in the problem statement.\n4. For instance, jet skis, which are an item that can outcompete the boat.\n5. In another example, a shark can outcompete the speedy boat because of their sheer size.\n6. Therefore we can infer from the context that jet skis or sharks, on larger water bodies, will outcompete the boat described in the question.\n\nThe answer is B: jet skis.\n\nInput: \"I like watching hockey.

{"text": "capability.\n7. So, we can confirm that options B, C, and D are all viable locations where Marmots can ascend.\n8. We can rule out option A: 'outside' because it is too broad a context and does not necessarily allow for the possibility of upward movement.\n9. We can rule out E: 'tree' because 'tree' alone does not imply any upward motion.\n10. This leaves us with A through C and E to pick from.\n11. Now, with contextual clues (such as use of hands to climb upwards), we can eliminate E: 'tree'.\n12. We can eliminate C: 'jungle' because 'jungle' is more of a general term that does not provide more specificity than 'outside'.\n13. This leaves us with B or D; both of which do not have significant differences in the description, with the only distinction being that D: 'rocky hillside\" has the word 'rocky' added.\n14. However, because the phrase has the word 'rock' on it, there does not need to be any additional emphasis on using the word 'rocky', as the word already implies the meaning we are looking for.\n15.

Choices: A: going up the stairs B: running around C: hiking D: walking around E: playing b-ball\nRationales:  1. The question asks to select the description that best describes the use or purpose of the car.\n2. Looking into the given choices for the purpose of driving, all the options would be possible uses, and none exclude the other options.\n3. In this case, if we consider the car is \"very old\", it would have likely stopped being used over a period.\n4. Moreover, its owners might not be in a healthy condition or capable of exercising a lot, so walking or running with it may not be possible.\n5. The last option A: going up the \"stairs\" would not be suitable. It does not make sense for an \"old car\" to be used for going up \"stairs\", as such usage does not align with the car not being able to have its wheels in motion or not being able to traverse for long distances.\n6. Only option B: 'running around' would be suitable for reasons such as explained.\n7. Since running around is a suitable possible use for the car in this scenario, the answer is B: running around. \nAnswer: B: running around\n\nInput: The man's job was to fix his boss's broken computer.

Choices: A: function B: operate C: perform D: work E: control\nRationales: All computers have RAM (random access memory) to do what? Choices: (A) function, (B) operate, (C) perform, (D) work, (E) control. \n1. From all the given choices, we know that (E) control, (A) function and (D) work are not correct answers because all the options listed above (E) control can have more than one form of control and are often inaccessible to humans. We also know that (B) operate and (C) perform are not correct because (D) work implies that (B) operate is not a function of RAM. \n2. Out of all the provided answers, the (E) control only provides more than one form of a logical outcome for a computer in addition to the answer in the question being correct. Because (A) function can be considered a component of (E) control, we can logically eliminate it. \n3. This leaves (A) function and the (E) control. We choose option (E) control as the correct answer to the context of the question.\nAnswer: C) function\n\n<!--- * -->\nInput: What is the meaning of this sentence: \"the car is a car\"? Choices:  A) the car is a car B) the car is a vehicle C) the car is a house D) the car is a person E) the car is a chair\nRationales: This question is asking for the meaning of this sentence \"the car is a vehicle\". We know that \"vessel\" is often used to describe vehicles. \n1. We need to consider what all of these potential answers mean which means we must deconstruct all the given answers into their different parts.\n2. Option (A): \"car is car\" is the only one that contains fewer words than the sentence we were given. The answer to this question should only be a word in the context of the provided sentence. \n3. However, since the sentence reads \"it is a car\" rather than \"car is a car\", we can rule out this the correct answer to this question. \n4. Options (B) and", "answer": "C: winning or losing"}

Choices:  B: seagull C: penguin E: reindeer D: walrus F: snowy owl\nRationales:1. The question asks which of the animals listed above are commonly found in cold places or locations.\n2. As a preliminary consideration, the word \"cold\" in the first sentence could imply temperature or location. \n3. If we assume the sentence refers to temperature, then all answers but the reindeer and the walrus would be suitable choices.\n4. However as it states \"these animals...\", we must consider the entire sentence and realize that it probably refers to both temperature and location. \n5. Now, considering the list of animals and their characteristics, we can eliminate options B and C.\n6. Although both these animals exist in harsh environments, they cannot be found in cold regions where they could enjoy the cold temperature at the same time. \n7. So, the list of animals is narrowed down to D, E, and F.\n8. Snowy owl lives in polar regions, so it is suitable because we want animals that reside in harsh locations. The reindeer, on the other hand, is a large mammal that lives in snowy areas, so it is also suitable.\n9. We can eliminate option E: reindeer with F: snowy owls because it already includes the characteristics of both the animals. \n10. So, the answer to the query is 'D: walrus' because it is the only suitable option left.\nAnswer: D. walrus.\n\n\nInput: If a large party was in a house, in which room would people stand? Choices:  E: hall B: front room A: den C: entrance room D: dining room E: parlour\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about an arrangement of people in a house, specifically referring to a situation in which a large party is present.\n2. Although there would be many rooms that would be unchanged while a large party would occupy the house, the question is very specific about the kind of room in which people would need to stand, so analyzing a generic room arrangement is not suitable.", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

C: doing yardwork D: vacationing on the beach\nRationales: The context of the sentence indicates 1. Your grandfather is spending his weekends at home or work, and 2. Your grandfather is a person and does actions on the weekends.\n\nYoung kids should learn to respect their elders, and a simple way to start is by asking them how their grandparents spend their free time. In this case, you could ask them where their grandfather finds himself on the weekends. This question requires thought and, in my experience is usually enough to get some chatting going between you and the child.\n\nIf you're trying to decide where to have a family photo shoot, you can ask your grandparents where \"downtown\" is. When I asked my grandparents where downtown was, they pointed to a large mall that was pretty much the center of the city. In case you're looking for a bit of an amusement park, I recommend a theme park, but that's just my opinion.\n\nThe grandchildren can ask a similar question as a way to introduce themselves to the grandparents. This is a way of letting them know that you are interested in learning about your family and that you care enough to try. By taking an active role in the conversation, you are letting your grandparents know that you care about them. This is something that they will appreciate and love you for.\nWhile some people will try to get a quick answer out of their grandparents, the best thing to do is to ask them questions about their childhood. You can give your grandpa some ice cream and a couple of glasses of wine, and he will be happy that you are enjoying his day. If they don't have any stories to tell you, you should try to make your own, because stories are a huge part of being a grandparent.", "answer": "D: neighbor's house"}

Choices:  B: shells C: clown fish D: piranha  E: starfish\nRationales:  1. The context of the question is implying that the fish mentioned live in the seashores or shore.\n2. The seashore refers to the area between the water and the sandy beach or land.\n3. This implies that the types of fish that live in the seashare should be found in these specific areas that are a mix of water, land, and other entities, like sand.\n4. Based on this, the question can be rephrased as \"What types of fish live in areas that are a mix between water and land?\"\n5. The options listed,'shellfish', 'clown fish', 'piranha', and'starfish', are in fact all types of fish. They each have a water and land component.\n6. The only possible exception is'shellfish' because of its name, but this is only an implied association because shellfish can still generally be found in the seashore where the question is asking.\n7. It's highly likely that fish can be found with one another in the sea, but that isn't what the question asks. Thus, it can be inferred that the fish live in an area that is a mix of water and land, hence, the answer should be \"all of them\".\nAnswer: A: all of them\n\nInput: Turtle meat is what?

She didn't want to what? Choices: keep annoying family members, get better sounding singing, continue annoying family members, stop annoying her friends, stop annoying her mom\nRationales: Answering questions like this usually involves deducing the correct answer from the given information, as opposed to a yes/no question where choosing the correct answer is based on reading the statement and saying whether or not it is true.\nIn this problem statement, we are given that the girl is sad because her mother told her she shouldn't be making a certain sound, and the options are what she might have been doing.\n\n**This is a trick question!**\n\nThere isn't a right answer as the statements in the options are inversely proportionate to each other.\n\nWhat we should do is determine which answer doesn't align with what we know.\n\nIf the girl is sad, she must have been annoying someone, right? So, the answer must be what she wouldn't want to do, i.e., annoying her friends or her mother.\n\nWe have 3 choices that contradict \"continuing annoying her friends or mom,\" so that eliminates all other answers except B: \"stop annoying her mom.\"\n\nAnd thus we get our correct answer:\n\nAnswer: B: stop annoying her mom.\n\nInput: There is often a misconception around the term 'fair' when it comes to what it actually means. For instance, it is difficult at fair markets to locate the fairest price for any one object. Choices: A: fair B: foul C: decent E: bad D: good\nRationales: Anything the answer describes must have a meaning or definition in our daily context. In this specific case, a fairness mark up in the market refers to how fair the price at which items are bought and sold through the market are.\n\nThe two terms given as an example of not being fair are 'fairest price' and 'foul'.\n\nThe price for an item may or may not be fair; that's why 'fairest' and 'foul' are two potential options.\n\nNext,", "answer": "C: control children"}

Secondly, at a time when there were no satellites, the Earth was not always visible. In general, \n3. the Sun and stars were used by prehistoric tribes that had to rely on the stars to navigate the world. Even in more developed cultures, \n4. like those in China and the Americas, star charts were the main form of navigation.\n5. For the  Ancient Mediterranean, the Suns location in the sky was used by traders and sailors.

Choices: B: boat park C: parking building D: docking station E: car park \n\nRationales:\n1. We have the \"you\" and \"park\" parts of the question. The sentence seems to ask for the type of location where a boat should never park.\n2. From the given choices, an answer should be something that is a place or is usually associated with the word \"park\".\n3. We can check out the contexts associated with each choice.\n4. The term \"car park\", which is an appropriate context, does not refer to places where boats are found, and thus does not meet the contextual expectations.\n5. From the remaining choices, \"boat park\" is the most consistent context and thus likely the answer, as it is a place that boats are found and usually referred to as parking.\n6. Accordingly, \"boat park\", that includes \"boat\" and \"park\" in its context, is the most likely correct answer.\nAnswer B: boat park.\n\nInput: At what does a rhinoceros chew?

Choices: A: playing golf B: running races C: playing sports D: making friends E: being generous\nRationales:1. The question focuses on people who are highly competitive and that indicates that competitive skills are involved in the question.\n2. The choice \"making friends\" implies a social activity which is not associated with people who are good at something.\n3. Likewise, it is not associated with being generous either because generosity in general is considered to be a desirable quality. Also, generosity is often used as a tool for making friends.\n4. The choices \"running races\", \"playing sports\", and \"playing golf\" all describe typical competitions that require special skills.\n5. We know that people that have this skill may be better at playing golf because of the precision and concentration involved with hitting small balls, which is an important skill to be a good golfer.\n6. This answers the question by finding that playing golf is what \"people that are highly competitive\" are good at \"being good at.\"\n7.

Choices:  - A: because they'd cook faster B: so that they would be fresher C: so they wouldn't die D: because they'd become tastier E: because of their texture\nRationales: This question can be answered by observing the options closely. As we can see the options are: A: because they're cooking faster, B: so their texture is improved, C: so they don't die, D: because they're tastier. These all do not make any sense as lizards needs to be cooked before they're eaten. Hence, answers that require a lizard to be cooked before being eaten are the right answer.

The key word is \"to shield its eyes\", which suggests a visible movement.\n3. The bird choices of A: bird and C: reptile are not visible at night. Thus they are not the correct answers. The bat choice of B: animal is also not visible at night, so it is also eliminated.\n4. From this, we can infer that the ostrich is an \"animal\" as it is visible during both day and night, and it is \"seen\" with its \"nighttime eyes\".\n5. Therefore, B: animal is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B : animal\n\nInput: A cow is a what? Choices: B: herbivore  C: carnivore D: beef  E: steer\nRationales: While the question is about what classification of animals cows belong to, there is another question being asked, which can be broken down as follows.\n1. This question asks about what adjective describes cows.\n2. A cow is, technically, a herbivore: it only eats plants, rather than meat. However, cows are also commonly classified as a kind of meat called beef.\n3. Therefore, we know that the adjective to describe the cows in the options A: herbivore and the cow-meat word of C: beef are suitable choices. B: carnivore and D: ste", "answer": "A: perfume"}

Choices: A: gardens B: fields C: plantations D: orchards E: plant nurseries\nRationales: The \"farmlands\" are referred to as the main source of food, the source of vegetables.\n\n1. The correct solution to the provided question includes \"gardens\" - because \"orchards\", \"plantations\", and \"plant nurseries\" is too broad and cannot be found in a particular place.\n2. \"gardens\" is the only one left that fulfills the requirements of the question and \"fields\" is not an answer.\n\n## Input: Where might you find an alligator?

So, she asked how she would be able to achieve this. 2. A: climb is the answer as it is the only option that implies the movement to the top. \n\nInput: Cutting down the tree was dangerous so I took many precautions.

The solution is to understand that each letter is telling a different part of what it is or was. Here it's referring to a tree. 1) A: A hired shark is a silly thing to do so we would know that it can't help with cutting the tree down \n2) B: A knife would help cut the tree, so we know this is relevant to the precautions the person is taking to get to the top. 3) C: We can infer this because the person is referring to precautions and they can't possibly take track of where they're at while cutting the tree down. 4) D: This is relevant because a sharp tool can help with making it to the top. 5) E: This doesn't make sense because scissors can be used to cut the tree, but the problem was already asking if they brought the tools and not if they brought scissors. 6) F: A buddy would be a distraction when cutting down the tree, which can", "answer": "C: soft drink"}

Even though he was a terrible competitor,  what sport would you bet he'd be playing with his friends? Choices:  B: cricket, soccer C: badminton, tennis D: basketball, soccer E: basketball, baseball\nRationales: Choices:\n1. The context here is that the brother is good at tennis but the younger brother is terrible at it.\n2. The younger brother isn't very competitive because of it.\n3. So, the question asks \"even though he was a terrible tennis player, what sport do you bet he'd play with his friends\".\n4. Analyzing the choices, we can eliminate E: baseball as it is a different sport altogether. The same can be done for C: badminton.\n5. A: cricket looks more logical option. They are played with similar equipment - bats.\n6. B: soccer looks more logical choice too, as they both can be played in the same places, with similar equipment, and with a team.\n7. D: basketball is also a good option because it too can be played in the gym, with similar equipment and it can also be played inside a team.\n8.

However, combining a 'hill' with a 'hand' means the Marmot can potentially reach the top of the hill.\n9.

Choices: A: blend in with its surroundings B: impress mates C: frighten predators D: escape prey E: attract attention\nRationales: The given question is asking about the reasons for a chameleon's color changes.\n1. The statements about the chameleon indicates that the color changes can either be to blend in with its surrounding or to impress a partner or mate.\n2. However, the answers do not satisfy the reason.\n3. The first question that comes to mind while interpreting the option B is 'Why does a chameleon impress male mates?'. Even after considering this factor, the description does not apply.\n4. The chameleon' s color change is not a'method a partner uses to impress' them.\n5. Thus, B: impress mates cannot be eliminated completely.\n6. However, option E: attract attention is the most appropriate explanation.\n7. The color change should be appealing to the opposite sex, which gives an idea why to attract predators would not stand.\n8. In the same vein, option C: frighten predator is not eligible because even if the color change is scary for prey, it is still more attractive to predators.\n9. Therefore, the correct answer is 'attract attention', as all the other options fail to satisfy the reason.\nAnswer: E. attract attention\n\nInput: The bubbliness of the champagne is a sign of its what?

This phrase means the opposite of \"lack\" is what, hence the question requires you to figure out what's the opposite of \"lack\".\n1. The options contain the following words: greatness, badness, good, talent, and skill.\n2. Greatness and badness is the opposite of \"lack\"; therefore, they are incorrect options.\n3. Similarly, \"good\" and \"skill\" are also the wrong answers because these words are what's being \"lacked\".\n4. From the remaining two, the correct answer is \"lack of talent\".\n5. We know it is lacking in two senses: it is the lack of a talent or skill for the purpose of salesmanship, and also because it is lacking in this sense, we know it is the opposite of badness i.e. greatness. Therefore, it is the opposite of goodness. \n6. Therefore, the answer here is option C: lack of talent.\nAnswer: A/greatness,C/lack of talent\n\nInput: Many species of whale are known for having long, what? Choices: a: eyelashes b: fins c: tongues d: tentacles e: beaks\nRationales: We have to guess what's specifically \"long\" about many species of whales.\n1. Whales do not have tentacles or beaks; therefore, these are incorrect options.\n2. \"Fins,\" despite its length, can still move around and are not \"long\" in the sense where many whales have \"long\" tails.\n3. \"Tongues\" are long enough to be called long but do not qualify because not all whales have long tongues.\n4. Therefore, it is either choice A or B.\n5. To be long, it should not move or flap with the wave and be held in position without much movement.\n6.

Choices:  Tutorials A: a new machine B: a refreshing class C: a comprehensive course D: a good practice E: a strong foundation\nRationales: The answer we desire here, 'A new machine,' or 'A refreshing class,' is one that would provide the required level of instruction before being able to successfully complete the type of tasks we are referring to in the question.\n1. When we say 'Tutorials' we are referring to a teaching method for students which can range in skill-level from simple'refreshing classes' to more difficult, higher level 'comprehensive courses'.\n2. Therefore, 'Tutorials' would not be a valid answer because although the first option given is 'A new machine', this is not a term associated with the 'Tutorials' definition.\n\n3. Although there can be a strong 'foundation' or'structure' of instruction, this cannot be achieved through simple or 'new information' being provided because the answer to the question is more specific than that.\n4.\"Comprehensive course\" is correct in this context even though it may seem redundant since the question refers to a 'type' of task.\n5.

B: plants 3. C: spices\nRationales:\n1. There are three columns in the table and only three choices in this answer. The question requires us to determine the class that the carrot is part of.\n2. The question states we need to classify the carrot based on three categories. \n3. For this answer, we first need to examine each column and figure out if it is relevant or not.\n4. The first column indicates that the vegetables column is not to be considered.\n5. The second column indicates that the plants column should be considered.\n6. The third column indicates that the spices column can be considered. \n7. Thus, if we have excluded one column, we can compare and select the most appropriate option from those that are left.\n8.

In this step, we will consider each of the choices to validate if it can be applied to snake or not. \n3. A: walk\n4. If someone is walking in a slow manner, they tend to go fast and move forward.\n5. Generally, snakes don't move forward like this, they either crawl or creep slow or they don't move at all.\n6.

Choices: \n\n### Demostration:\nInput: How much would you spend on a gift if it costs 1/10 of itself, to give to your girl friend?\nRationales:\n1. The expression \"costs 1/10\" indicates that the price relative to the original would be 10%.\n2. If we were to simplify the expression (since percentages are expressed as units of 100), we could rewrite it as such. So the price that constitutes 10% of the original is 10/100 = 1/10.\n3. The expression \"1/10 to give to your girlfriend\" is ambiguous and does not give a direct answer as to how much we have to spend. We do not know the original amount.\n4. In order to decipher the question, we can look at the remaining part of the expression. By the time it gets to your girlfriend, the percentage must have been reduced to 1%. As a percentage, that 1% is equivalent to 1/100. So, \n5. now we know that 10% of its original price would be 10/110 = 1/5th.\n6. This will help us answer the question, how much would you spend on the gift, if it costs 10% of itself?\n7. If we were to multiply the amount by 10, it would cost us 550% of the original price.\n8. Since 550% is equal to 55/100, we can state the correct answer as 55 100. Thus, we have to spend 55% of the original price of the gift.\nAnswer: 55 1/10\n\n\n# Trivia Questions\n\n### Input\n> 1.

The king has had to sale off a vast amount of land: If the king has had to sale a vast amount of his private land, he could well have purchased it to build a castle on, and then lived in it, thus there was no need to make the castle large.\nRational 2. The king went bankrupt: This would mean that the castle was sold to cover debts, this would be true whether the castle was large or small.\nRationales B: The king's spending too much money on unnecessary expenses: The key idea here is that any money the king spends on the castle is not unnecessary, and thus a large cast has been built as a result.\nRational 3.

He was confused because both his hands were tired. D. He liked to do things in different ways and so it confused him. E. He was very sleepy.\nRationales: Questions about people and their traits can be hard to answer. Because they ask about the individual, they do not provide any context for the reader to understand why certain things happen or the way they happen. Sometimes, this can make a sentence confusing and the words seem out of sync. Often, the key is looking for clues about what might be happening with the subject of the sentence before reading the question.\n1. The first task involves thinking about what you know about writing. We can probably come up with a list of reasons why someone might have difficulty writing, but let's think about what isn't likely to happen.\n2. There are probably no physical impediments to writing. The person is usually able to use two hands for writing in the question.\n3. This makes it unlikely that they will run out of time. They may be running out of energy, though.\n4. This is a good answer because there are a lot of different reasons why someone might be sleepy. Often, when we don't have time to be tired, we get sick, so we might be sleepy from a viral infection.\n5. You could also be tired because you didn't eat enough breakfast.\n6. They could also have a stomach bug like food poisoning.\n7. Also, if you're tired because you're not getting enough sleep, then this is almost always because of a medical condition.\n8. There are many possibilities, but not many reasons why someone is sleepy.\n9. The next task is asking ourselves what we know about the person who has the problem we've seen.\n10. The man might be tired because he has an infection.\n11. This may be because he is in a different time zone and has a tough transition.\n12", "answer": "D: shopping malls"}

He had a job which was not computing. But then he learned much about computers.  What did he become? Choices:  a) a teacher b) a writer c) a librarian d) an administrator e) a technician\nRationales: In the problem statement, the subject was \"he\". Therefore, we need to figure out what he is based on the information provided.\nFrom the information we get in the problem statement, we conclude the following:\n1. \"he\" was a student, but he didn't know much about computers.\n2. \"he\" had a job which was non computing.\n3. \"he\" learned a lot about computers.\n\nThose information are enough to draw a conclusion that this person could've become one of the jobs that he learned about, because we can't determine what he became from the information given.\n\nIn this question, the information is limited to \"he\", the age he was which indicates that he must have been a student, and the fact that he knew little about computers, but later he learned about computing.\n\nAs for the jobs he knew about were non-computing, it means that he most likely has a background in computer science and he knows many jobs and knows what they do.\n\nBased on those information, he could've become a:\n1.

Choices:  C: early mornings D: night E: day F: early morning\nRationales: In this question, we are given the time of day, as well as a range of potential answers.\nBy analyzing the sentence structure, we know that the time of the cat sighting is most likely either early in the morning or at night. Furthermore, we are told that the range of potential responses include \"early morning\", \"early in the morning\", \"night\", and \"day\".\n\nThus, the cat sighting will occur at either \"early morning\", which has the same meaning as \"early in the early\" or \"night\". However, given the word choice, \"early morning\" is actually a better answer.\n\nWe know that \"early morning\" refers to \"early in the mornings\", but \"night\" has an overlap with \"evening\".\n\nIf the time of day is chosen to be \"night\", both of these responses will be acceptable. Therefore, \"early morning\", because it does not overlap with \"evening\" like the other choice, is the best fit.\n\n\nAnswer:\n\nF: early in the early in the morning\n\nOr\n\nF: early morning\n\n\n### Instructions:\n\nFor the following question,  perform a text search in Microsoft Word.

Choices: A: bags B: chairs C: fruit D: clothes E: money\nRationales: One of the features of a lunch box as the name suggests is that it contains food.\nWe know from context that the lunch box doesn't contain only food, there is room to spare. This means that it can also contain things that aren't food.\nWhile it is true that a kitchen has cabinets with lids on them that can store food and items that aren't food, it is not a proper description of a lunch box because it doesn't have a lid. However, a kitchen does have cabinets that are open on the sides.\n\nA kitchen might have drawers too but they're usually not big enough to hold bags or large sized apparel.\n\nA lunch box can hold bags of any sort.\n\nA lounge/study has a coffee table and maybe a side table that can be used to store food and things that aren't, it does not also have a lid on them though. The kitchen might have a table with a lid too.\n\nFrom the context, we know that lunch boxes don't have a lid so we can't think about lounges/studies/kitchens. However, we need to think about areas that have two openings such as drawers and cabinets in a kitchen. These areas are not lounges, they don't have a table with a cup or lid but they have cabinets, drawers and openings where we can store food and things that are neither food. This means that a lunch box can store bags.", "answer": "C: butterflies"}

We are given a couch with a lovely white sheet on it and a table covered with many sets of coffee mugs. The instructions are what do we read from this information?\n2. The number of books on the couch is not mentioned in the question and is not relevant to the answer.\n3. From the given information, the question seeks the number of sets of books and coffee mugs.\n4. As is evident from the question, the number of sets of coffee mugs on the table is not relevant to the total number of books and coffee mug sets covering both the couch and the table.\n5. Since the couch has one book, there would be more books on the table than on the couch. Also, a set consists of one book and one coffee mug.\n6. Therefore the answer is: C: books and coffee mugs\n\nAnswer: C: books and chocolate\n\nInput: If the ship arrived early, what might not have happened? Choices1: The ship had a mechanical problem.

D: It might have been foggy.\nRationales1. The question refers to a ship that arrived early, and asks what might not have happened if the ship was late. \n2. We have two choices: A & B. \nThe answer is A: It might have had mechanical problems. The ship arrived early because it did not have mechanical problems. If the ship had had mechanical problems, it would have been late.\n \n# Output: The ship has arrived early.

Wireless network. 2. Router. 3. Network adapter. 4. Power cord. 5. Wireless receiver.\nRationales: The statement uses the term 'device' to refer to a wireless mouse or keyboard, indicating that the question refers to an optional device or tool necessary to control the wireless mouse.\n1. From the choices, Wireless network and Router don't fit the description provided in the problem statement. They are connected devices, they are not a tool or extra device used to control the wireless mouse or keyboard.\n2. Wireless network is used to describe a network, usually wired or a wireless network itself, that can be connected to a wireless mouse to enable its control. Accordingly, it should be included in the answer.\n3. Network adapter is a network-specific technology, not a tool or extra accessory to the wireless mouse that can be employed to control it. Like Wireless network mentioned above, it should also be included in the answer choice.\n4. Power cord is something that is used to provide an electric current to a device, which can also be used to power a wireless mouse or keyboard. But, it is not something external like the wireless network adapter or the wireless network. Therefore, this is not a relevant answer.\n5.

Choices: A: leaves B: soil C: sky D: trees E: water\nRationales: The question asks for the best answer based on the context.\n1. The description for rain has a contextual reference to rain leaving leaves.\n2. We can think about the question as: \"where can we confirm there was rain?\"\n3. When it rains, there must be raindrops. Raindrops fall to the ground and fall on plants and trees and on the ground.\n4. The soil is what is on the ground. We can make that inference. Leaves and trees are what will get raindrops onto them, especially leaves.\n5. We are asked to look at the what.\n6. Since leaves and soil will not be seen when it is raining directly, we should look at the water, the what which is most suitable.\n7. Hence the answer E: water.\nAnswer: E water\n\nInput: It can be difficult to determine where a rain shadow will be formed between mountains.  If it's a cool, dry season, which of the three questions does the answer to this effect depend on? Choices: 1.  Temperature. 2. Wind speed. 3. Snowfall amount.\nRationales:\n1. To begin with, we can eliminate option 3 because the question mentions three choices, so if we know the answer of choice 3 does not affect the question then it must not be the answer choice because of the same reasoning. \n2. We can also eliminate option 2 because it seems very vague to say if it's a cool dry season. It is possible that it is very hot and dry and that has very little to nothing to do with the temperatures affecting the season. \n3. Temperature should be the possible answer because in the beginning, it was stated that temperature will be the most relevant thing.

In this case, if the chef was indeed anguished at the smokiness, it was because of \"the smokiness of the smoke.\"  This would imply that his anguish was at the food he had prepared, but did not have in actuality.

Choices:  B: development\nC: the progressive learning experience\nC: the challenging experience\nD: the learning process\nA: the progressive challenge\n\n \n\nRationales:\n1. There are two phrases in the sentence that should be analyzed - \"The challenging experience.\" and \"The progressive learning experience.\"\n2. The first one implies a difficulty or challenge, while the second one points to an educational experience or progression.\n3. Analyzing the two sentences gives us the context that a professor was talking about an assignment being difficult, but okay, and that it is part of the \"progressive learning experience.\"\n4. So what can be the meaning of \"the progressive learning experience\"?\n5. It must be the act of progressively learning things.\n6. This aligns with the use of the words \"The professor said the assignment was.\"\n7. The phrase \"difficult, but okay, and all part of the progressive learning experience\" does not make sense if \"progressive learning experience\" refers to the act of learning something.\n8. So we can rule out \"D: the learning process,\" \"C: all of development\" and \"C: the progressive challenge\" as incorrect because they cannot represent the context properly.\n9. We can rule out \"B: development\" because the phrase \"the progressive learning\" already denotes \"development\" (i.e., progression or growth).\n10.

The question asks why the woman complained about her clothes being sent to the dry cleaner.\n2. Examining the various choices, the woman did not complain about the cost of the service. This is because if she was upset about the price, she would have found it relevant to bring it up, and not complain in the first place.\n3. Also, according to the question, the woman did not have an issue with the delays in getting her clothes back. She's only complaining about her clothes not being cleaned.\n4. Henceforth, this implies that the issue does not lie at all with the time or price, but instead with the cleaning aspect.\n5. This leaves us with two possible options. 'She didn't like dry cleanings' and'she didn't like the solution'.\n6. 'She didn' you like dry cleanings' implies that she is against the very activity of dry cleaning, while'she didn't see it like a good idea' infers that she disliked the recommendation itself.\n7. However, from the wordings we have'she didn't ask him' so the phrase 'like the recommendation' becomes less relevant than 'like the idea' itself. Therefore, 'like the idea' could have been 'like the suggestion' or 'like the advice'.\n8. This is further supported by'suggestion' and 'advice' being both synonymous and both describing actions made by an individual.\n9. Considering this, 'her didn't like the advice' is a better fit for the woman's complaint.\n10. Therefore, the answer must be F: she didn' talk to him for the advice.\nAnswer: F: she didn' ask for advice", "answer": "C: isolation"}

He told his dad something was \t burning in his stomach. His dad asked him to what? \tChoices: A: eat B: brush teeth C: take medicine D: bang E: talk\nRationales:  \nThe boy was in pain and told his dad that something was burning \tin his stomach. Then, his dad asked him to do the same thing.  \nThe word that is missing is \"burning\". If we look at the four options \tit is clear that they are all doing something either verbally \tor physically. So, we now have to identify which verb \trefers to the action of \"burning\".  \n'Eat' isn't verbally speaking but physically doing, and would \tnot be the appropriate part of speech for the missing word.  \nThe action of brushing one's teeth is not a verbally burning \tin one's stomach.  \nThe verb 'take' is more appropriately to describe the act of \thealing, in which case medicine is the answer.  \nThe verb of 'bang' is more for hitting something, which isn't \tthe point of the question.  \nThe final choice is 'bang', because the action of verbally \tcommunicating through speaking is an action that burns \twithin the stomach of the boy.  \nHence, the correct verb as the missing word is \"bang\" \tor \"talk\".  \nInput: Where was the baby that was lost in the water?", "answer": "D: shelf"}

Choice 'A' and 'B' are irrelevant because they don't describe why the boy's dog did not understand fetch, or why his dog was lazy.\n2. Choice 'C' is not relevant because it refers to the boy's motivation for playing.\n3. Choice 'D' is not relevant because there are other options to play fetch.

For the second part of the qusetion, i.e 4 bars, it means that the answer given so far is correct, let's go for the options and find the correct answer. \n- if option A is selected, this means that the answer given before is wrong, and there should be fewer bars\n- option B is saying that after the answer in the previous question, there should be 1 more bar\n- option D means that 4 bars was given as input, and 1 is already subtracted.\n- in option E, 4 is equal to 3 + 1.\nHence option A is the only right answer.\nAnswer: A option is the right answer.\n\nInput: The team beat its rival in a cricket match yesterday.

The option refers to the option which \"build muscles\".\n3. The keyword is'muscles'. We need to establish a correlation between doing push-ups and building muscles.\n4. According to the phrase 'do a few push-up', the reason for doing them is to build muscles.\n5.

Choices:  i. take it to a car wash station ii. let it rain iii. wash it yourself iv. leave it outside v. buy gasoline\nRationales: The keyword here is 'you'. The question's phrasing implies that you have a car and need to have it washed, which is an action you are responsible for. \n1. The first option 'i. take it to a wash' can be interpreted in two ways:\n2. either it should be interpreted literally, which is highly unlikely because the question asks specifically about washing your car or\n3. interpreting 'take it' as taking ownership or responsibility. If interpreted as taking responsibility for washing the car, it is inconsistent with the question's phrasing.\n4. Option ii.'let it rain' is not a process you can apply to your car to wash it.\n5. Option iii. 'wash it yourself' can be applied to the car, but not by you, as the question specifies you will have your car washed.\n6. The remaining options 'iv. leave it outside' and 'v. buy gasoline' also cannot be applied to your car or to you as you will not wash the car.\n7. Therefore 'iv. leave it out' and 'v.buy gasoline' are eliminated.\n8. It leaves us with two options i.'take it to a car was' and ii.'let it rain'.\n9. Since they are not acceptable, we know the answer as i.'take it to the car wash'.\nAnswer: i.take it to the carwash\n\nInput:  What is the name of the thing where you would leave your stuff when you go on vacation Choices:  A.

Choices:  B: rugs are usually wider A: a carpet is not wider C: the carpet is more narrow D: this is like a tapestry so it should be done on a machine E: both are different\nRationales: Analysis of the Options:\n1. 'Carpets' are floor rugs that are made of different types of fabric like wool, cotton, silk, or synthetic material. A common characteristic that most carpets might share (but is not universal) is that they are often thick or piled and cover large portions of floorings.\n2. 'Rugs' can be any shape, size or quality of fabric, but are usually smaller in coverage area.\n3. Consider the choices, all of them seem related to carpet, although there might be something else behind the question.\n4. Option 'E: Both are different' indicates that the two objects have distinct characteristics. The carpet is more likely than the rug and the latter is different from the former.\n5. So the answer is either 'A: a carpet is usually more narrow', 'B: a rug is usually wider' or both could be true.\nAnswer: A & B: rug is wider; Carpet is narrower", "answer": "C: lake"}

The options listed are choices from the menu the chef created including a list of used spices.\n2. 'E: pepper' can not be the answer because pepper is not mentioned in options.\n3.

People that have more than one restaurant of the same type. Choices:  A a: chefs B a: cashiers C a: waitresses D a: clerks E a: cooks\nRationales: This question is based on the general context of restaurants.\n\n1. A restaurant is an organized place where people obtain food and eat. Generally, the food in a restaurant would be prepared by the waitresses or chefs.\n2. According this, options A: chefs, A: cashiers, A: waitresses, and A: cooks are valid and acceptable choices.\n3. Therefore, our options are \"A: chefs\", \"A: cashiers\", \"A: waitresses\", \"A: cooks\".\n4. \"A clerks\" is not a suitable choice because Clerks work in offices and not restaurants.\n\n5. \"B: Clerks\" is also not a viable choice because although clerks are working in a restaurant's office, they are not working for the restaurant itself that is being described in our question.\n6.

Choices: A: in the ocean B: on the surface C: at the bottom D: under the ocean E: in a river\nRationales: The problem question is asking about fishing and fishermen.\n1. The fisherman knows what kind of places cod are found (in other words, cod's habitat) and how they can be found there (by fishing).\n2. Cod is a type of fish.\n3. Fish tend to be found in or around bodies of water.\n4. One body of water in particular is the ocean.\n5. Therefore, we can deduce that the fisherman knows all the places, or areas, where cod are found.\n6. From the options listed, A: in the ocean, B: at the bottom, C: on the surface, and E: in a river are the ones in which cod can be found.\n7. A fisherman knows the places cod is found.\n8 These places are bodies of water so, the fisherman probably knows the areas of the ocean, the bottom, the surface, and the river.\n9. Thus the fisher knows all of these places, or at least most of these places, that cod can be found in.\n10. If the fisher knows where cod is found in or around bodies (a very common type of waters) of water, the types of bodies of water can be narrowed down as A: in the ocean and B: in a river.\n11. If the type of body of waters is too broad, we can infer it to be A: in the ocean.\n12. Thus, A: in the oceans are found are places cod may be found.\n13. If you're following these rationale's steps closely, you can probably answer that question.\n14. However, in case you cannot, the answer is E: in a river.

C: jersey refers to clothing that might have different colors and may have a team logo or markings on it. A person could then buy different jerseys and play with more than one team. However, to use this term in the context of the question, it must be a verb. In order to make the verb 'wear' the plural form of the noun 'jersey' is used.\n4.

While copper pipes and tap filters refer to water plumbings, neither of these two options are suitable substitutes for carbon filters since the task at hand is to filter out tap water.\n4. Therefore, the answer provided is B: carbon filters C.\nAnswer: B- Carbon filters\n\nInput: You can't find the phone because someone moved it.  Where might it be located? Choices:  C: kitchen D: bedroom E. hallway F.living room\nRationales: The sentence is quite ambiguous because it does not specify if the someone is the family member living with the phone or a stranger. Hence we need to identify the context of the sentence to answer the question\n1. Since the question asks for the location of the moved phone, we can rule out A: on the desk\n2. As such, we get to decide between B: kitchen, C: bedroom, D; Hallway, and E: living room.\n3. We know that the phone is gone, meaning that someone had a reason to not keep it where it was and move it either to another part of their house or another home.\n4. So, the options that would best explain the phone's new location are B, C, and D. \n5. However, if someone found it so inconvenient to keep the phone in the kitchen, they wouldn't very likely move it to there. Therefore, the next viable option to think about is A, the bedroom.\n6. Looking at the remaining options, it's unlikely that the phone will just end up by random occurrence being moved into a living room.\n7. Besides, a living room is also an optional location where the phone could be, if the situation did not involve it being", "answer": "B: frustration"}

Choices A: talking about the pool B: showing you the pool C: talking to you outside D: pointing to the rockpool outside E: pointing out the rockpool outside\nRationales: The question is asking what it could mean if your dive instructor signals or points to a rockpool. We know they are talking/ pointing - to or the rock pool. We can rule out C: as talking with you outside would mean they can't point to the rockpool. We can also rule out D as pointing out the rockpool is too vague, also as to which rockpool? E? The answer does not follow the 'rockpool' description. Option E is incorrect.  A: talking about the rockpool, means the instructor is talking about the rockpool. Answer: A\n\nInput: Where have you seen these? Choices A: in a box B: around the room C: near the stairs D: in the kitchen E: in the garden\nRationales: Where do you go for stargazing? Option A: in a box indicates this can not be the answer. Where do you watch the stars? Option B: around the room indicates this can not be an answer. Where are you in a show? C: near the starring refers to where the star is placed/ found. Option D: near stairs refers to a place in a building/ room. Option E: in the garden refers to where the garden is located/ can be found. Answer A around the room could be stargazing (looking at the stars)/ or telescope. Option B around the room could be looking at the stars (in a telescope). Option C Stairs refer to a type of building/ or something in the building. A show has many settings or locations/ can be in many places.

Choices:  B: Because it was on sale for the first time ever.  C: The store was doing a great job of promoting it.  D: It seems as though everyone was talking about it.  E: People thought it to be very trendy.  F: This is the first day it's been on sale.\nRationales:\n1. The store is likely trying to explain why there is high demand for the item they have on offer.\n2. Looking through the choices, the item being offered or sold in the story can only be associated with 'B: Because it was onsale for the first time ever.' and 'F: This is the first time it's been onsale'.\n3. Choice D: It seems as if everyone were talking about it cannot represent a reason for high demand. The phrase 'it seems' can only mean 'this is how it seems' and not 'actually'.\n4. According to the question, this is the first sale of the item in store. So, the answer has to be F: 'That is the first day it has been on sale.'\n5. Therefore, option F is the correct answer.\nAnswer: F: This is the only time it's been sold.\n\n### Exam Time: \n\nInput: Which is the most important toy? Choices:  C: a teddy bear B: a doll D: a teddy bear C: a doll D: an action figure E: a teddy bear\nRationales:  1. The question states that there are several toys, and based on the other answers given, an action figure is also listed among them.\n2. We are told that these toys are important to a child because of their monetary value, not because they are fun or playful.\n3. Looking at the choices, we can see that dolls are an important toy with monetary value, but the words \"a doll\" could possibly be referring to one thing as opposed to all possible dolls existing. \n4. \"A teddy bear\" already tells us that the most important thing to", "answer": "C: blowing hard"}
{"text": "characteristic. \n7. Therefore, it is possible that Marmot can use its 'hands' to get to the top in a 'tree.'\n8. The tree has branches that a Marmot may utilize to climb up to higher points on the tree.\n9. There are many instances of Marmots using their hands to climb on a tree and even go to the roof of a building on a tree.\n10. On the other hand 'hill' is too vague and does not adequately capture the specific characteristics mentioned in the problem statement.\n11. Thus, it should be discarded.\n12. Therefore, the answer choice C: jungle is also not suitable because, while the Marmont may climb a tree, they would not be found in a jungle.\n13. A Marmots' habitat is rocky inclines, such as hillsides or mountains.\n14. 'rocky hillside fits with the description of Marmots. Hence, the answer to the question is D: rocky hill side.\nAnswer: A rocky hill side\n\nInput: If someone wants to lose weight, when is best not to be on a diet? Choices: 1: during weekends 2: over a weekend 3: on weekends 4: a long weekend 5: on holiday\nRationales:1. The question is saying that someone who is on a diet is advised to not be on it on a specific day or time frame.\n2. We should deduce the time required to know where not to diet\n3. The time of the diet has to endure the period to which the option refers\n4. The question is asking if a diet should not be on during a 'long weekend'. We know it means when we do not need to follow a diet strictly like when we are on vacation or on a holiday, so we can exclude from a diet over the weekend/weekend/weekends.\n5. Long weekend refers to the holiday weekends.\n6. The only day left is on the holidays, we cannot have a diet on holidays because we can't eat restricted diet on the holiday when we normally eat normally on a holiday, we do not need a strict diet on a holiday.\n7.

Choices: A: potato CB: pot B: toast E: apple\nRationales: The problem states that the food might be \"a bit tricky for kids\".\nKids generally eat food such as potato or toast since they're nutrious and easy to chew.\nTherefore, option A: 'potato' would be the best choice because 'potato' is easily chewable and nutritious for kids to eat. However, potato is not a 'tricky' food.\nThus, 'potato' is not the most appropriate answer.\nFor option B: 'pot': The question specifies that the food might be tricky. Pot is not a food but a cooking vessel. Therefore, 'pot' cannot be the answer.\nFor option C: 'toast': Toast is likely to be found in breakfast items and is not nutritious for kiddos.\nFor option D: 'apple': An apple is too hard for kids to eat and would be \"bit tricky\" for kids as the option states.\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is E: 'Apple'\n\nInput: The restaurant that is in a downtown spot is great for families that have children of all ages to enjoy what? Choices: BB: cheese A: spaghetti C: cake D: meat E: pasta\nRationales: Option A:'spaghetti' is a popular meal that is both popular and nutritious among kids, making it suitable for a family restaurant. However, children of all ages enjoy spaghetti.\nAlso, spaghetti can't be said to be 'great' as the question is speaking to a restaurant that is 'in a downtown spot'. Moreover, spaghetti can be found in every country and is not 'great'.\nTherefore,'spaghetti' isn't a good answer.\nOption B, 'cheese': Cheese is not", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

Choices: \tA: yelled B: screamed C: growled D: hissed E: groaned\nRationales: The question is asking about what the writer revealed in her letter. We can infer that the writer is revealing, that is unveiling, a new fact about her father. She reveals that her father does what when angry.\n\n1. Considering the question, we can tell that it is not asking about something he does or does not do when angry.\n2. Analysing the choices, we can infer which ones do and do not fit the context that are given. \n3. We can eliminate the choices, \"A: yelled\", \"C: growled\", and \u201cD: hissed\u201d because none of those options indicate the writer's father getting angry. \n4. We can eliminate the choice, \"E: groaned\" because even though the verb, \"groaned\" does imply that a person is upset or angry, groaning doesn't always imply the person is angry, only tired or distressed.\n5. Since the answer has to indicate what the writer's father does when he is angry, we should consider what the choices imply. \n6. The choices, \"B: screamed\", and \u201cE: growled\u201d are the only options that denote what the writer's writer's father likely does when angry. \n7. Hence the answer to the question is choice, \"B: screwed\".\nAnswer: B: Screamed\n\nInput: The company will announce soon about what. Choices: \t\tA: new hires B: job openings C: salary increase D: promotions E: bonuses\nRationales: This question is an example of a question using two different types of prepositional phrases.

The prepositional phrase can be either a restrictive prepositional phrase or a non-restrictive prepositional phrase. A restrictive prepositional helps form part", "answer": "E: reproduce"}

Choices: 0.5 A: cranium 0.7 B: legs 0.8 C: legs and cranium 09.9 D: cranium 9.7 E: head\nRationales: Consider the statement: \"The most likely position for a giraffe, using this data, is the cranium.\"\n1. The unit \"9.9\", found next to \"D: cranium 8.9\" denotes the number of giraffes where the cranium is the most likely position (9.9/100)\n2. Since the units that precede the \"0.7\" and \"0.8\" also contain the number \"1\", we can infer that they stand for percentages.\n3. Therefore, the data that follows the \"?:\" in the question would indicate which percentage of all giraffes have their craniums on top of their legs.\n4. Combining numbers, we can conclude that \"9*9.9/110\" is roughly equitable to 0.7 (94/100 rounded down).\n5. Similarly, \"4*9.9/59\" can be equated to 0.8 (98/60 rounded down).\n6. Therefore, \"9*9.7/119\" is roughly equitable approximately to 0.9 (98/101 rounded up).\n7. The answer option representing the cranium as the most likely place on 98/100 or 98% of giraffes is A: cranium.\nAnswer: A. cranium\n\nInput: The lion was roaring, why was it so angry? Choices: 1.

At which meal can you most likely say grace? Choices: 1. A: Breakfast 2. B: Dinner 3. C: Lunch 4.

However, we don't say grace at brunch.\nHence, we can conclude that the correct answer is 'D: Brinner'.

All these choices speak to places where Marmots can be found and can be used by the Marmots to climb upwards. While 'hills', 'rocky hill sides', 'trees', and the like are natural or constructed areas, and thus an appropriate location, a 'hill' indicates it is smaller than a tree.\n9. Since the question is asking for what a Marmot can climb or move to. We need a location that is greater than a hill and therefore, we can safely exclude these three choices.\n10.

Choices:    A. stays away   B. runs away    C. leaves place    D. seeks food    E. hides\nRationales:\n1. The question refers to the behavior of cockroaches when exposed to heat.\n2. The options are 'A: stays away', 'B: runs away', 'C: leaves place', 'D: seeks food', and 'E: hides'.\n3. The word 'behavior' in the context, indicates that these options must be actions, not state of physical presence.\n4. Moreover, out of the options available, 'D: seeks' is the only viable option because the rest of them indicate something other than what is required.\n5. From this point forward, looking through the options, 'C: leaves place' and 'E: hider' are ruled out.\n6. If cockroaches ran away, they couldn't 'leave the place' in which they were residing.\n7. Similarly, if they 'hide' or go into hiding, they aren't likely to 'leave place' simultaneously.\n8. Hence, they are not suitable options.\n9. The options that are left are 'A: stays', which is more of a state than an action, and 'B: runs away'.\n10. 'B: runs away' is more apt because it indicates that cockroaches exhibit avoidance behavior when it is hot, which fits the context.\n11. Moreover, 'A: stays' implies a state of something, which is contradictory to 'runs away' as actions are more suitable here.\n12. Thus, the correct option is 'B: runs away.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: She couldn't have gone to the store, it was too early in the morning for that.  What time was she meant to go?

Choices:  Animal A: snake B: bobcat C: bear D: rabbit E: mouse\nRationales:   1. The question requires us to identify which animals are the student likely thinking of when the professor said \"horrifying.\"\n2. The professor admonished the student for using the word \"horrifying\" in the wrong context.\n3. She told the student that their choices of \"bobcat\" and \"bear\" were inappropriate because they weren't terrifying enough.\n4. We know that \"mouse\" is probably not the student's answer based on a previous question and because it doesn't qualify as terrifying and more fitting in another section of the question.\n5. Analyzing the word \"horrify\" in the context of the first question, we note that it's defined as a verb that means \"to cause feelings of fright or panic by something horrible or disgusting.\"\n6. Based on this, we assume the word to be related to horror movies or other movies that are scary or thrilling.\n7. There are many horror movie stars and we can infer this from the options provided.\n8. Therefore, considering this information we can eliminate options B: bobcat and D: rabbit because they're animals and not actors.\n9. We can eliminate A: snake because it's more of a reptile than anything else and probably isn't considered scary enough to fit the \"horrify\" word connotation.\n10. Based on all these, we can assume the student is referring to a certain actor when asking the professor which animal is more likely.\n11. According to her response, it's E: mouse. Thinking about this answer will show that she is talking about the'slasher' actor Jason Voorhees who played the role of a psychotic and terrifying character in horror movies.\nAnswer: E (Jason Voorhees)\n\nInput: What's a common activity a teenager", "answer": "C: bound"}

However, the library card mentioned must be used for accessing the internet because a library card generally allows a person to access the information on or through a library's network. \n(3, 4) These two answers indicate something that the library card is used for but the statements do not say so explicitly.

She had a serious disposition where she could make everyone feel what? Choices: A: good B: sad C: bored D: embarrassed E: anxious\nRationales: The context of the sentence implies that the sternness of the teacher is leading to emotional reactions from others.\n1. It's unlikely that everyone is feeling the same thing and so B: \"sad\", C: \"bored\", D: \"embarrassed\", and E: \"anxious\" cannot all be true for this context.\n2. The teacher is being characterized as having a \"serious disposition.\" B: \"sad\" and C: \"bored\" do not imply that the teacher's personality is serious, only'sad'.\n3. D: \"embarrased\" is the opposite of \"embarrassed\" and does not match with the description.\n4. Similarly, E: \"anxous\" means worried about one's surroundings and the situation.\n5. So we can eliminate \"anxious\" - it is the opposite of what's asked.\n6. The only appropriate option that can work here is B: \"sad\".\nAnswer: B: sad\n\nInput: The student who scored the highest didn't have what?

The student has scored high \"despite\" having an unfavorable condition. \n2. One might therefore conclude that the unfavorable condition for him is \"not having enough time to study\" or \"not having a good teacher\", but his marks are high despite these conditions. \n3. Hence, \"without a good teacher\" nor \"with a lack of time\" can be the reason behind his high marks.\n4. \"without much support from his family\" is another possibility, however \"many supports\" can still lead to lower marks.

A shoes, a hat and a table are unnecessary because they would have to be extra accommodations for guest rooms.\nD: A hat would not be the only extra item. A chair is the only item needed in the statement to be both extra and necessary. A tables, a shoe, and a hat are all unnecessary or unneeded items.\nE: A table is the only other item needed besides candy. Guests would most definitely need seats and tables to use.

Different means two separate things that are unalike or different. They imply a dissimilarity between subjects, but not a comparative characteristic or property of one location being superior to another.\nB: A: The options \"similar\" and \"alike\" have some similarity but they do not seem related. To suggest something being 'like' another subject is to have two subjects in the same category or place. The given words \"similar\" and \"like\" can be used to describe people, not locations.\nC: C. The phrase 'quite different from' suggests that one thing is different from another. This implies that one subject's characteristics are noticeably different than another subject's.

Choices: 1 A: prevents fruit from falling off 2 B: ensures that no two vegetable pieces are alike 3 C: produces a strong-smelling scent 4 D: makes pumpkins yellow 5 E: turns orange 6 F: allows gourds to last years\nRationales: We can deduce the question has to do with pumpkins by the appearance of carotenoid, the name of the molecule that \"turns\" the pumpkin \"orange\". A carotenoid is any naturally occurring, pigmented molecule whose colour helps pumpkins and other vegetables to identify and attract animals and insects that help with pollination or seed dispersal. Carotenoids are fat-soluble molecules that turn orange when carotenoids react with the fatty acid linoleic acid. That's why pumpkins or marrows turn orange when they are overripe.\n7. The orange colour of pumpkins, vegetables and fruits are the result of a mixture of two pigments (carotenoids) which are naturally occurring in vegetables. Carotenoids react with another fatty acid called linoleic acid in our bodies producing a mixture of two molecules called \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and lutein that gives the ripe pumpkin a bright orange color.\n\n### Demo:\nInput: Which of these is not a real part of our heart?

Mr. Shen'E computer is very interactive and it can be assumed that the computer has a lot of activities, video and interactive games with which his students can have fun and learn at the same time.\n2. A computer that belongs to a friend, can not be used at the same time by more than one pupil. This is not a good choice for the students.\n3.

As the question asks for some ingredient which might she look for, we need to consider every possibilities. Sugar and cinnamon are spices that must be added before baking. If candied cranberieres are used then they must be candied, then added after baking. So no candied cranberlies.

The options 'fish' and'shrimp' have the word in common. 'Fish' also has a's' at the end. \nTherefore, both these options are appropriate choices; hence we have to go through to see if any of the other choices fit. While the second option'shrimp' is suitable, the first choice 'fish' is not appropriate since fishermen do not hunt fish for food. We need to look at all the other possible options. We can eliminate'shark', as sharks are not in any way the food of fishermen. We can also eliminate 'bird', as fishermen do not traditionally go after birds either. So the options left are'mammal' and 'a bird'. 'Mammal' is possible but very unlikely, since fishermen are often looking for food at sea and mammals such as whales usually stay in the sea. Therefore, the only remaining option is 'bird'.\nAnswer B:\n\nInput: Who does the chef hate and why does he hate her?

Thus, if the farmer's harvest was bad, it means that plants and trees were damaged. \nThe choice C: 'crops and trees that were completely damaged by crop' this kind of crop and the trees can be destroyed by weather conditions, so if the crop or tree was destroyed by weather condition, there was no harvest.\nThe choice D: The cereal was destroyed but many crops and trees were not damaged: It means'many crops and trees were dead' because if the crop and the tree were killed by weather condition, plants and trees will also be destroyed.  \n\nThe answer A: The cereal is destroyed so many plants and crops were dead. So the answer is choice A.\nAnswer: A & I\n\n## Output:Where is more likely to buy?

The question: \"When you go into work, are you required a jacket, it is always cold there.\" has two keywords: need and jacket, it asks: \"it is always cold there, in what condition jacket is needed\"\n2. The options A: jacket B: sweater C: wet D: cold E: drippy A: jacket, B: sweater, C: wet, D: cold, E: drippy are all wrong, the question asks about condition of jacket which is needed to be answered, not about the jacket itself.\n3.

{"text": "unique capability.\n7. Hence from the available options, we should conclude that the question is about Marmots, not about things at a higher elevation.\n8. Therefore, the answer must be E: tree.\nAnswer: E. tree\n\nInput: Which option of the following could be considered as appropriate or acceptable? Choices:  I: A and C only II: B and C only III: C and A only IV: B and D only V: C and D only\nRationales: From the choices provided, the correct answer should be V: C and D. We know this by using the following steps.\n1. We cannot choose I: A and C because option A cannot be chosen with option C in the previous options. \n2. We cannot choose II: B and C because option A and option B are mutually exclusive as they cannot all be true. \n3. We cannot choose III: C and A because the answer must be one, meaning it can be either A or C, but not both.\n4. We cannot choose IV: B and D because option B is not mutually exclusive with option D, so they can both be true at the same time.\n5. From the analysis and by elimination, we arrive at the only answer that is appropriate and can be chosen: option V: C and D, or all. From V, we know that C is always an acceptable answer option, regardless of another answer choice D. Conversely, D is acceptable as an answer option of its own, so long as C is not selected. \n6. Therefore, from the analysis and elimination of the options to arrive at the correct or \"best\" option, we know that the answer must be V: C and either D or nothing.\n7. This can be understood further by explaining why the answer must be one of these two options: C or nothing. Remember that C is always an approved and acceptable option, so long as D is not chosen. Therefore, C is the \"one\" or \"best\" because if nothing else is chosen as an option, C is still accepted. \n8. For the same reason, D can also be accepted as an answer option of the \"best\", regardless of other answer choices. This is because if the first correct choice of C is made, C alone can be chosen next even if D is approved. \n9. Therefore, the answer should be D:", "answer": "C: being found out"}

Choices: A: inventive B: resourceful C: creative D: resourceful E: inventive\nRationales 1.  The sentence context indicates the need for being'resourceful.'\n2. While A: 'inventive,' B:'resourceful,' C: 'creative,' and D:'resourceful,' all imply the need for someone to be resourceful, there is one option that clearly does not make sense: E: 'inventive.'\n3. 'Inventive' pertains to the creation of things, not being creative while using resources.\n4. So, from the choices given, only 'D: resourceful' means the same as the context stated in the sentence.\n5. Therefore 'D: resourceful,' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: D Resourceful\n\nInput: My mother used to tell me to wash my hands before supper. She said that I should be what? Choices A: careful B: dirty C: greedy D: rude E: sneaky\nRationales:\n1. The question is about what my mother would tell me to do before supper. It's important to note there are two contextual indicators that suggest this is a child asking:\n    a. The sentence structure implies that the narrator (a child in their family home) is relaying or sharing a story with the listeners (probably someone or some persons in their family). \n    b. The sentence refers to things in the context of a family \"home,\" which is likely a child's home.\n2. Looking to the question, we can see that the options listed all have some degree of conflict and disharmony. \n    This provides clarity on the intention of what my mother might tell me, to show me to be considerate. \n\n3. So, the options 'A: careful,' 'B: dirty,' 'C: greedy,' 'D: rude,' and 'E: sneaky' all capture aspects of unruly behavior that are likely to cause problems at the family table in the evening.", "answer": "D: wildlife refuge"}

Hence, the place where the Marmots can be found based on the characteristics provided in the sentence is a 'tree'.\nAnswer: E: tree\n\nInput: How did it happen? Choices:  a: quickly b: suddenly c: easily d: quickly e: suddenly\nRationales:The question asks about how an event happened.\n1. Options a: quickly and b: suddenly are both plausible explanations.\n2. Quickly implies the time it takes to perform an action while suddenly suggests a shocking or unexpected development.\n3. Since the sentence does not give enough details to decide among these choices, both are feasible explanations.\n4. But option d: quickly is not suitable because, being a statement, the word \"quickly\" appears to be redundant as it describes the \"how\" in question.\n5. Option e: suddenly, however, is plausible because it is a sentence and does not include \"quickly\".\n6. Thus, the answer is e: suddenly.\nAnswer: E suddenly\n\nInput: Do you like to fly? Choices: 1.

From this you can conclude that there would be a need to place a mouse in a box or a freezer.\n2. You also know that the freezer can be found in the kitchen at times because a living room fridge or refrigerator can be found in a kitchen more often. \n3. A fridge is used to store food.\n4.

A _____ store is a store of books.\n2. You have a library you can access on your computer or a shelf of books.\n3.

{"text": "being able to climb with hands.\n7. Therefore from the available options, the answer is E: tree\nAnswer: E: tree\n\nInput: The professor said that he had spent years studying the language of trees. What kind of linguistics does he study? Choices:  C: tree C: dialect C: biology C: zoology C: botany C: ecology\nRationales:1. The question deals with a statement from a professor that he spent years studying the language (of trees).\n2. The language of trees is a term that people use to refer to the tree species diversity. This implies that the professor studied either tree species or their diverse group. Since this is known already, we can rule out B: dialect (a form of the language spoken or written by a person or group of people, or by all speakers of a particular language in a specific region). B: dialect is concerned with dialect specifically referring to the differences between two or more types of human speech of the same language. These linguistics are different from the actual tree species' diversity, indicating that this is our answer.\n\n3. The following choices B - E are terms that describe tree species' attributes:\n\n* B: botany (a branch of zoology that deals with the physiology, structure, genealogy, and ecology of plants).\n* C: ecology (the branch of biology that deals with relationships between living organisms and their environments).\n* D: zoology (the branch of biological science that studies the structure, embryology (development of an animal or plant from the egg), evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of animals).\n* E: biology (the science dealing with living matter), which is just a general term and is also the same as the choice D - zoology.\n\n4. All of these are options that can refer to tree species linguistics, but we can narrow these down by focusing on those that do not describe humans' relation to the language or dialect of the trees. In our case, we know the professor studies the language of trees, meaning that it doesn't focus on the dialect used by humans with trees or a particular type of language or dialect.\n5. All these other options refer to tree species, not necessarily their diversity or 'dialect'. Hence the appropriate choice is C: tree biology, with the", "answer": "C: orchestra"}

Choices: B/ irritated A/ frustrated C/ flustered D/ irritable E/ disillusioned\nRationales:1. The question asks us to identify the state of anger of a certain male subject in the question.\n2. From all available options, we know that \"frustrated\", \"angry\", \"irritated\", \"flustered\", and \"irritable\" are state words that can be used to describe the mental and/or emotional state of a person or thing.\n3. However, only \"frustrated\" and \"angry\" are words suitable to describe the context given in the question.\n4. For example, \"disillusioned\" would not apply in the given scenario as the person is likely not disappointed in the context, but rather, angry.\n5. As for \"irritable\", that too does not apply because the person is not just irritated but is also angry since \"irritable\" does not specify an emotion or state.\n6. This leads us to the next viable option: \"angry\". If frustrated = B, angry = C, irritated = A, irritable = D, then we can deduce that the person is \"B\" - \"angry\".\n7. Now that we've eliminated the wrong answers, the correct answer can be derived from the three remaining ones.\n8.

Choices: 1: B: none 2: D: two 3: E: four 4: A: 12\nRationales: The problem question states that two people have 18 and 14 bones each; they have the same number on their sides yet 2 bones may get transferred, so the question is asking the number that remains if we have the same bones on our side.\n1. If I have 17 bones and you have an extra bone, you now have the same amount as me.\n2. Therefore, on our sides of this equation both sides should not remain as same.\n3. If we add 1 to 16, we have 17 which is 1 more. Therefore total number will be 12 on both sides.\n4. Hence A: 12 is the answer.\n\nInput: The book that was stolen from your house, which is in the woods. Where is the book now? Choices: A: in the woods B: on your house C: in your house D: in the woods\nRationales 1. The book described in the question was stolen from the house which is in the woods or jungle.\n2. The question is asking us where the book is now, based on the description of the woods and house.\n3. We know that the book is not in the woods anymore because it is now in your house and that the book that was previously in your house is now in the woods.\n4. We also know that the house is not in the woods because it is in your house.\n5.

Choices: A: sink with the ship B: perished with the ship C: became marooned with the ship D: froze with the ship E: freeze to the cliff\nRationales: Ships are made to traverse large water bodies and can only sink if they hit something that is heavier than water (i. e. a shore, a floating object, or a cliff).\nThe question implies that the ship's heavy weight collided with a clif's mass such that both couldn't submerge below water\nand thus, were stuck together.\nThis implies that there was no other water body besides the cliff and that there were no people outside of the ship.\nThe word 'with' is used in the choices to refer to the people inside, in other words, the people onboard.\nTherefore, the question is asking what the people onboard did because a ship has to disengage from a cliff to proceed.\nThus, the only reasonable answer would be that the ship was disengaged from the cliff and the people had become marooned to the same cliff and were thus perishing.\nTherefore, D is the best answer.\n\nInput: What did the girl find when she finally arrived at her destination?

The main focus of this question is to determine the reasons why people still include the sharpener in the package when sharpening the pencils.\n2. A sharpener is a tool used to sharpen pencils and make them useful for writing and drawing.\n3. In the context of the pencil, its sharpener that has malfunctioned or become useless because it does not sharpen the pencils as it should.\n4. To answer the question, we will determine which response offers the best explanation as to why a sharpener is added to the package when the sharpener was not actually required to sharpen the penncils.\n5.

The question is referring to a tree of life with the phrasing \"which of the following\" and \"is likely to be\" suggesting some kind of inference.\n2. In trees of life, we typically find animals that are not necessarily from the same category.\n3. A \"tree of life\" could feature species from categories such as mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, arachnids, etc.\n4. However given the limited options in the question, we can narrow in on the choices in an order that is relevant for finding potential answers.\n5. 'Snakes' could belong to the reptile category.\n6. 'Monkey' could be a mammal.\n7. 'Mouse' could also be a mammal but would be unlikely to be on a tree representing all species of life on Earth.\n8. 'Crocodile' would be a reptile.\n9.

The question refers to a statement about safety with the phrase \"as well\".\n2. Examining the statement, the context is that of safety in playing. It's possible to play many things on switches; however, we are not sure which specific activity is being referred to.\n3. It's also not clear whether we are referring to the light switch or safe in itself (as an adverbial modifier or intensifier).\n4. We need to see exactly how the statement refers to the situation being described.\n5. Thinking about the safety involved with playing on the mentioned switch, we can imagine how it might be unsafe to play with it.\n6. Since it's not specified whether we were specifically talking about the switch, we will examine whether it's unsafe to play on it.\n7. Examining the phrase closely, it's evident to us that the safety of those playing is meant.\n8. In the statement, there is a word \"well\" that can be read in two ways.\n9. It could be a positive affirmation which denotes well done or not in a very subtle way.\n10. Alternatively, it might as well be that \"well\" is a negation or contraction of \"not well\" or \"badly\".\n11. The latter explanation is what is likely given the context of safety or \"being safe\".\n12. This interpretation is in the context of the light switch not being safe. If we think of it that way, the entire phrase translates to \"if you do, you won\u2019t be well\".\n13. So, in this context, playing on a light switch would not be safe because people playing on it would not generally be well.\n14. Therefore, the answer to this question is C:'safe'\n\n\n\n\n\n```{answer}\n+ When we", "answer": "E: freezer"}

However, we can infer from the question that the Marmots must use their hands to get to the top in order to reach what's on top, and not merely be on the top because of their ascent.\n7. We can rule out the answer E: Tree because 'their hands to get to the\ntop' indicates that the hands are doing something and are not the\nobject on the top. \n8. Therefore, we are left with only A: hill and D: rocky hill.\n9. Based on the information we have garnered, the answer has to be the rocky hill because 'hills' can be reached with the use of hands and the rocks would give us both elevation and a surface to scale.\nAnswer: D rocky hill\n\nInput:  The box had an opening that gave the animal a way out. Choices:  A box B: bottle C: hole D: window E: lid\nRationales:  1. The question is about a box has an opening that gives the animal a way out of the box.\n2. The box has an opening that an animal uses a way out.\n3. The object in the sentence, by definition, is a box and from the options, only 'B: bottle' seems to be relevant. It is clearly a box because it's used by an animal and it has an opening which is how the animal uses to 'get out'.\n4. Other choices, including 'C: hole', are not boxes. Like 'B: bottle', it has the capacity for an animal to get out, but it is not a box because it is not shaped like a box.\n5. Although 'D: window' and'E: lid' could potentially be boxes or containers because they have a way out for an animal to depart, it is not clear whether either object can be considered a 'box' or not without further context.\n6. However, even if any of them could be seen as a box, B: bottle is still more likely because it is an object with an opening, which is the focus of the question.\nAnswer: B Box\n\nInput: The dog was a rescue and did not yet know how to jump up on its own, what action could it perform?

Choices:  Pineapples are grown in A: all tropical regions B: islands in the pacific ocean C: tropical countries D: jungles E: warm climates\nRationales:   1. The problem statement asks about where pineapples can be found.\n2 The question requires us to determine which region or continent is best suited for the growing of pineapples as stated by the given information. \n3 We can infer that pineapples grow in tropical climates because they are mentioned in the problem statement.\n4 Tropical climates are best suited for the growth of pineapples because they are hot and therefor conducive for them to thrive.\n5 We can eliminate options A and B because, although both tropical regions, A being all tropical regions, excludes islands in the pacific.\n6 We can eliminate options C and D because the phrases \"tropical countries\" and \"jungles\" could potentially be anywhere with tropical weather and not necessarily a tropical geographical region.\n7 We can eliminate option E because it is not consistent with the information given in the problem statement. Even if a warm climate is tropical, pineapples do not exclusively grow in warm countries but rather tropical countries.\n8 So, the answer is C : tropical countries. \nAnswer: C: tropical countries\n\nInput: Where is a person who is in the shade?

The hot dog is what kind of sausage? Choices: \tA: pork B: meat sausage C: turkey D: veal E: wiener\nRationales: I. The hot dog is a what?\n\n1. Some people like hamburgers and some like hot dogs, thus hot dogs are kind of a sub-type of sausage, which is what it is a what.\n2. We need to determine what kind of sausage a hot dog is.\n3. Hot dogs are considered meat sausages, so the answer is B: meat sausage.\n4. As a quick note, 'wiener' is an archaic term for hot dog.\n5. However, one hot dog is not necessarily equal to one wiener.\n6. Considering that hot dogs and wieners are sub-types of a sausage, a hot dog can be a 'wiener' as well.\n7. Since the entire question is talking about being like something, a hot dog can also be referred to as wiener.\n\n### Conclusion:\n 1.

{"text": "'hands' that they can 'use to get to the top'.\n7. As such, 'rocky hillside'and 'tree' can potentially be suitable places for the Marmot so are plausible options.\n8. However, the answer can only pertain to a single choice, so we need to rule out one option.\n9. As we consider 'tree', it's important not to overlook one key idea in the description that relates to 'the top' being relevant.\n10. Marmots can't simply get to the top, they need to 'get to the top' which entails climbing and reaching the top.\n11. From the description of the Marmots, we know that they are able to use their hands to climb trees.\n12. Therefore, since 'tree' pertains to the context of a climbable entity that Marmots can climb to reach 'the top', Marmots 'can use their hands to get to the top' which is the answer because 'they have hands' to do so.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: Which of these things are not likely to stay in the refrigerator for a very long time? Choices: \u2610 B: banana \u2610 C: avocado \u2610 D: blueberries \u2610 E: lemon\nRationales: The question is asking which of the given selections are not likely to stay fresh or usable for a long period of time.\nIf we examine 'E: lemon', 'B: banana', 'D: blueberries', and 'C: avocado', we see that they are all fruits and they are generally meant to be consumed.\nThe word \"stay\" implies that they will not be consumed and must remain fresh. So 'E: lemon' does not answer the question because lemons are fruit that need to stay in the reproductive cycle which requires them to stay fresh and usable.\nIn particular, lemons stay fresh and usable because of a vitamin E antioxidant in their skin and rind that protects the fruit and prevents browning.\nBecause 'E: lemon cannot stay in the refrigator very long', we can eliminate it.\nNext, let's examine the choices 'B: banana'", "answer": "A: being married"}

Choices:  Choices:  A. South Africa B. Spain\nC. California D. France  E. Italy\nRationales: The question asks which country is known for its wine production. We need to use the words \"known for\" as a clue. These would include countries that actually produce a lot of wine.\n1. South Africa has been a major wine producer for a long time.\n2. Spain also produces a lot of wine. They even have a \"wine country\" where wine is made and consumed in a country where they are very proud of the winemaking tradition. This is true of other \"wine countries\" in Europe. In the United States, these might also include California or Florida.\n3. France is of course known for its high-quality wines, though they are much more expensive. France has a wine country region named \"Burgundy\" for good reason. These are some of the best wines in the world.\n4.

Choices:  D: car D: boat A: airplane B: trailer C: pickup truck E: bus\nRationales: For car: 1. The most important aspect for analyzing the question is to identify the context. In this scenario, there is a list of items that each have different financial requirements.\n2. We first attempt to understand which among the given choices may be more expensive to operate. Car, boat, and airplane require fuel to move, and in the context they aren't a single unit, they have to be serviced and maintained. Thus, the items are each considered and evaluated to see if they're the more expensive to operate.\n3. The given options are 'D: car' and 'D: boat'. Car is the most expensive to run for sure. Drivers need to pay for petrol, gasoline, service, and other items.\n4. Boat has to also worry about fuel costs and maintenance, but boat rental or charter usually covers this expense so it can be considered as less expensive to operate.\n5. The item marked 'A: airplane' is the most expensive, but it's not provided as an option in the question.\n6. Another item on the list is 'B: trailer'. Trailers may be used for transporting items and are also prone to damage with use, so they may be considered less expensive than car or boat.\n7.

{"text": "hand.\n7. However, it's possible that Marmots could climb trees without the use of their hands, such as by hopping or climbing. Therefore, it's difficult to determine whether tree is a suitable answer or not.\n8. This is because a tree's being climbable, particularly by Marmots, is a vague contextual characteristic.\n9. Moreover, tree could be an abstract answer that refers to anything at all in a tree shape. Therefore, tree cannot be the right answer because it does not meet the criteria.\n10. This leaves us with the remaining three answers, which are 'rocky hillside'. It's suitable for the task because it indicates a surface that can be climbed by moving upward with one's hand.\n11.

Choices: A: nostalgia B: pleasant C: fear D: sadness E: anger\nRationales: The statement itself implies that the smell of Copenhagen was strong and noticeable.\n1. So, whatever it was, had to be unpleasant enough to cause some kind of emotional reaction in people.\n2. If the smell was pleasing or good, people would not be annoyed enough to react to it.\n3. Therefore, we can eliminate the option \"A: pleasant.\" \n4. Option B: \"nostalgia.\" It evokes a type of happiness that may be accompanied by other feelings.\n5. Option C: \"fear.\" It implies a scent that would be alarming enough to scare someone. It can be argued whether or not the smell would be \"distinctive\" or \"memorable\".\n6. Option D: \"sadness.\" The sentence describes a rather unpleasant smell that people would dislike. It could also be a reaction that accompanies fear and panic in some situations.\n7. Option E: \"anger.\" It's an emotion that may be accompanied by fear when people are in danger.

Choices:  a) They have good endurance. b) They live at high altitudes. c) They have very good sight. d) They dig tunnels. e) They have very good memories.\nRationales:1. We observe that this question is looking for a characterization, or identifying what is inherent to a Marmot.\n2. Considering the given characteristics, we can deduce that 'd') Dig tunnels' would be inaccurate, and 'e) They have very good memory' is superfluous.\n3. This leaves us with three options for the correct answer: (a) Good endurance, (b) They live at high places or (c) Have very good sight.\n4. (a) is referring to their health since the other two options do not indicate any characteristics of theirs.\n5. (b), being a place characteristic, does not apply to the species of animal we have been provided. We're only looking for characteristics that are inherent in Marmots, not where they reside.\n6. (c) They have very good eyesight would be more relevant if the question related to the sight of Marmots, but since we see the question is regarding their memory.\n7. (c) is also ambiguous and provides no specificity to what kind of sight Marmots have that is exceptional among their species.\n8.

{"text": "hands.\n7. In light of the analysis about what the hands can be used to do, we are left with B: hill and E: tree for possible answers.\n8. But 'B: hill' would just imply that the Marmots might be able to climb some hills, but not that they are 'on top.'\n9. Therefore, 'E: tree' is a better candidate where Marmots' hands can be used to traverse or get to the top of the tree.\n10. However, even though climbing a tree is within their ability, it would be a rather unusual location for a Marmot to be found.\n11. So, 'E: tree is not a highly probable option for this question.\n12. We then move to the next best, which also happens to be the best option, i.e. (A: outside).\n13. 'E: tree' indicates that they could climb a tree that's either outside or in a 'jungle', which are both places where the hands can be used in a climbing context.\n14. As the question does not ask for a specific action or movement of the Marmots' hands, it would be sufficient for them just to be 'up' and 'outside'.\n15.

B: They kill birds 3. C: Dogs are very noisy 4. D: He does not like furry creatures 5. E: He does not like small pets\nRationales: This question involves the analysis of the four statements given and choosing the one that makes the most sense. \n1. The options in the questions do not seem to explain why my father dislikes dogs and cats.\n2. Among the given statements, the last one 'E: he does not like small pests' seems unrelated to the question.\n3. There are two conflicting statements given: 'Dog does kill birds' (option B) and 'He does not like furry animals' (D).\n4. In the sentence 'He does not like small pest', 'pest' is referring to either insects or to animals that are not harmful, but annoying.\n5.

He was going to swimming so he was already there\nRationales:  1. The question makes reference to the fact that the fish is found on a truck.\n2. Accordingly, there are a few ways to find the fish, as provided in the multiple choice options:\nB. He ate it\nC. He spilled out\nD. He leapt out\nE. He was going to a swimming area\n3. The problem of choice A suggests that there could be multiple attempts at catching the fish which could account for a fishing spree.\n4. However we discard this since it contradicts the fact that the fish was found on a vehicle and not in an open space.\n5. Hence, we can eliminate A. He went on fishing spree because the statement doesn't make sense\n6. Similarly, option E does not fit the description. Since the fish's location could only account for being in water or a truck, E. He was going swimming cannot be the correct answer.\n7. So, we are left with B. He ate the fish, or C. He spilled in his stomach or D. He fell off the truck at a certain moment.\n8. Among these, the only answer which makes sense is B. He ate him since we can infer that the fish might be eaten from the truck after being found there.\n9. The fish might not be in the truck at all but in the stomach of the person who consumed it.\n10. So, the answer therefore is B. He aced him.\nAnswer: B. He ate", "answer": "A: school"}

According to the choices given, there are 3D objects as mentioned in the question statement.\n2. Accordingly, the possible answers should explain how each of the three-dimensional objects will look in three dimensions.\n3. However, there is no explanation in the choices for option 2, A cube, or 3 C, a globe of objects.\n4. Although 1 A, cube and 3 C, a sphere depict objects in threedimensions, they don't have any representation of the 3D shapes.\n5. Similarly, the choices depicted in 2 B, a pyramid, is an actual 3D object, but the choice is vague about how the object will look in three dimensions because it merely mentions the pyramid's shape.\n6.

But this isn't because those penguins are where? Choices:  - A: home B: native C: shelter D: migrating E: hometown\nRationales:1. The main context here is that'some penguins' are found on a rocky island.\n2. Looking for the context, an uninhabited one is the best option because penguins usually come home somewhere they have been before.\n3. So we consider 'home' as an option.\n4. Since 'home' contains the word 'native' within, which means their home is somewhere they're born, we can dismiss it as an answer.\n5. Therefore 'A: home' is not the right answer.\n6. So we consider 'B: native', 'C: shelter', D: migrating' and 'E: hometown'.\n7. 'B: native' implies their home is somewhere they are born, which is similar to 'home', so this answer is also to be dismissed.\n8. We can also dismiss 'C: shelter' and 'E: home town' as'shelter' refers to a building or somewhere to live, which doesn't align with the question of where penguins choose to live.\n9. Finally, 'D: migrating' suggests the penguins are migrating to another location, which is similar to the context of penguins travelling somewhere they'd previously been, so we can dismiss this option as well.\n10. Hence, the correct answer is 'E: hometow'n'.\nAnswer: E: hometown", "answer": "E: see things differently"}

(Collective nouns don't require articles in British English).\nThe question asks what we can \ud83d\udc49 find \ud83d\udc48 gymnasts in so we know that a gymnast is always singular, and a gymnast is not the same as a gymnastics.\nWe can infer this because the choice we don't care about, 'c', is 'c' in \ud83d\udc49 'can't'.\n\ud83d\udc49 \"can't\" indicates that a negative action is taking place by adding \"can't\", meaning \"we can't \ud83d\udc49\".\nOur answer, E:'mountain', is the one that has the most potential to be true.\nThe other choices appear impossible because of their description. Gymnasts need to be trained and practiced, most likely at specific facilities that would not be a mountain, and definitely not in a forest.\n\ud83d\udc49 We don't know if mountains ever have \ud83d\udc48 facilities, so that one isn't a good answer.\n\ud83d\udc47 All this is to say that we are looking for a mountain where we can find gymnasts.\n\nInput: All people in the street were excited.

We note she is not comfortable with the act of baking.\n2. However, she is uncomfortable with dancing.\n3. In contrast, she is also uncomfortable with speaking.\n4.

Choices: Become a health hazard A Become vermin infested B Fly away C Smell bad D Stink horribly E Become visible to neighbors\nRationales: When someone leaves the trash on their curb, it will become what if it were on their street.\n2. We are given five possible results and we need to answer the question \"What will happen if the trash is left out?\"\n3. It is important to note that the question asks \"Become a health hazARD, a.k.a. become hazardous.\" This hints that if someone trashes their stuff, it becomes hazardous.\n4. For all but one of the options, 'A' the trash will become a health hazard.\n5. Looking at 'B', this option is wrong because a fly infestation is not what would happen to the trash the more an individual's trash remains on the curb. A fly infestation occurs from one's garbage not being removed.\n6. The same thing is applied to the option 'C' but on a different scale. This option describes the trash as stinking. Stinkiness is different from being a health hazard: it depends on the contents and the way it is being processed (for example, composted rather than thrown out).\n7. Option D, 'D' is incorrect; the trash stinking is a result of decomposition.\n8. As a result, we can use reason #3 to deduce that 'E''is the only appropriate answer.\n9. 'A' is also incorrect because the trash on the street or curb would be visible to neighbors.\n10. We can thus conclude that 'E' is the correct answer.\nAnswers: E.

The question, though somewhat ambiguous, is asking us to identify what the professor is telling the class about learning.\n2. The options provided all have some kind of semantic overlap with the idea of 'learning'.\n3. However, the key to analyzing the question is to determine if the options are consistent with a process or if they can be classified as 'just something'.\n4.

They do this by mentioning that learning requires working toward something, an intention or goal.\n5. On that note, other options like 'E: anything' and 'C: something' are probably not suitable because they do not have an intentional focus in mind.

Choices:  C: it's in 3 dimensions   B: it shoots bullets D: it discharges bullets E: it is bigger\nRationales:1. The question is talking about a pistol and a revolver. Two things that we must establish here, are the characteristics that make them different from each other, and the potential characteristics that could make them the same.\n2. We're going to consider two possibilities regarding how they could be different in order to analyze the best answer option.\n3. Both revolver and pistol could shoot bullets or bullets could not be used but something else instead. This leads us to rule out the option B: option C D: option.\n4. Secondly, a pistol could be discharging or could just be made to discharge. This eliminates option E: the pistol is a firearm or something that discharges bullets.\n5. Given this context, revolver is a potential candidate to be the answer. It does have a number of characteristics for it to be chosen as the answer option.\n6. First, revolvers may be larger, with \"big\" suggesting size. We can also infer that revolvers are likely multi-dimensional. This is further supported by the statement saying \"it's in two or three dimensions\", implying that the answer option for the question can be in any of the three dimensions.\n7.

What we can infer from the choices is a spelling bee and a new school is not possible because their parents are with them.\n* Since their parents aren't coming for them to wait for them, it's not likely they're getting ready to move to a new home.\n* A new school is only possible if they're getting ready for a big trip and moving temporarily.\n* Children are usually not anxious to see their parents.\n* An autopsy could be done privately at home.\n* A vacation is more likely when their parents would take them.\n* If their parents are with them, they probably would not be going to a dentist or autopsy privately. \n* It makes all the sense that they are waiting for a family vacation. \n* Therefore answer is 1.

This means that not everyone is unable to do their best at home. For that matter, all the people at home are not doing their best work. This means that not all the people at home can not do their best work. So, all of Choices A, B, C and D are ruled out because of this.

Not how many years before it was impacted. So we can automatically eliminate A and B. (In 2000 to what year would the question end?)  Also, no one talks about the year the earth impact was in BC years. So C is eliminated. This leaves us with D and E. (5-4=1) 2000-11000=1000 1999-1100(2)=899 Now, when we divide 899  by 800 we get 0.8225.

Choices:  Choices:  A) river B) cave C) creek D) pond E) puddle\nRationales: The question is asking which of the given options is the most likely place where a frog would be found.\nA. river: We can rule out A, the river, since frogs are found in other natural bodies of water.\nB. cave: Frogs can be found in caves but this is not the most likely option as there are few caves that frogs frequent.\nC. creek: We can infer that this choice, 'creek', can be a suitable location for frogs, since frogs are generally found in waters and creek falls in the category.\nHowever, we can further narrow this to creek mouths.\nD, the pond: Frogs tend to prefer shallow ponds. So, it is highly likely that frogs would be found in a pond.\nE. puddle: Puddles are temporary bodies of water that tend to dry up quickly, making them a far less likely option as a frog's choice of habitat than ponds which can support frogs for a long period of time.\nA. river or B. cave: Frogs are not typically found in these two locations and therefore not the most likely places to come across a frogs.\nC. creeks or D. ponds: These would be suitable places frogs might be found.\nE. paddles: This would require us to rule out frogs because it is not a suitable habitat for them.\nThus, as we can infer from the above, the most appropriate answer for the question is D. pond.\nAnswer: D. pond\n\nInput: Where does water often stop?

From the choices listed, we see that we can eliminate three answers.\n2. \"L: sleepy\", \"N: awake\", and \"O: exhaustion\" are not antonyms because they either use a different verb to describe sleepiness or involve an implication of an extreme reaction or over-exhaustion by the individual.\n3. We can eliminate \"Q\" because the word \"Quiet\" does not mean the opposite of 'work' in this context.\n4. Therefore, only one of the choice options can be the correct answer.\n5. Looking at the remaining, \"M: bored,\" \"M: tired\" and \"M: exhausted\".\n6. These words are antonyms of 'worked' but refer to an extreme state that is not likely.\n7.

Choices:  D: sharpeners  K: rubbers  W: erasers  Z: sharpener\nRationales: We can determine the context by analyzing the object or term \"pencils.\"\n1. We know from the question that the teacher is referring to something that can be used at school but might be related to office supplies.\n2. From there, we can eliminate options \"D: sharpeners,\" \"K: rubbers,\" and \"Z: sharpener.\"\n3. These objects aren't pencil sharpeners which implies use with pencils and that might only be relevant in school.\n4. They don't have much relevance in a work (adult) context.\n5.

Choices: 1:  A: transport a vehicle B: keep things safe C: help with what D: be used for other items E: used to carry keys\nRationales: The keychain is a key ring that can be used to bind a large number of keys together. It is typically attached to a key ring or a pocket for convenience.\nThe primary use of a keychain is to transport multiple keys together. According to the question, keychains are primarily used to make transportation of several keys easier.\nInput: People like how he spoke.  He was articulate.

The question refers to buttercups which grow in land environments, not those of a lake.\n2. A lake is an inland body of water, in contrast to a creek, pond, river, bay, or ocean which is an area of water found outside of a land setting.\n3. Since a lake is a land body of water, it would not be ideal for buttercups where they do not typically live. \n4. Hence, since we know that the body of water mentioned is a lake, the answer is D; the lake is a bay.\nAnswer: D. bay\n\nInput: It rained on Tuesday.  How long ago did it rain?

Where is the best place to buy holiday supplies? Choices:  H: shopping center T: house F: garage G: dollar store B: dollar tree W: mall\nRationales:  1. The question uses the phrases \"a Christmas tree\" (singular) and \"holiday supplies\" (plural). Note that none of the options refer to singular or plural items.\n2. Based on the context, options H: shopping center, B: \"dollar tree\", and F: \"garage\" are the Christmas tree related options because each of these has multiple Christmas trees, as opposed to W: mall where there would be only one tree per mall location.\n3. Therefore these three options provide an equivalent answer as the question refers to either one individual Christmas tree to be purchased.\n4. For holiday supplies, all the given options refer to different kinds of supplies that could be used for a holiday.\n5. Since this is not restrictive, we can go with any of them as a correct answer to the second question.\n6. Consider option T: \"house\" because it relates to an interior location rather than a location where you can enter to buy as in H: shopping center F: garage, B: \"dollard tree\", and W: \"mall\".\n7. Thus, the correct answer is option T: \"a house\".\nAnswer: T: house", "answer": "A: botanic garden"}

Choices:  B: phone company A: phone shop C: bedroom D: kitchen E: kitchen table\nRationales: The problem statement doesn't give a lot of information, but we can analyze it to get some information. First, the question starts with \"I bought a new phone,\" which implies the phone is new to the person speaking. Second, the question asks \"where can I find it,\" implying that the phone is currently missing or lost. Third, the list of potential places given includes things such as a phone company, phone shop, bedroom, kitchen, and kitchen table, which suggests that the place to find the lost phone is a specific room or area. Finally, given that the person who lost the phone is asking the question, we can conclude that the answer is going to be the specific place where the person is currently located, or at most a place nearby. Therefore, the answer must be the specific room or area where I bought a new phone.\n\n## Question \n\nIf only one of the three statements below is true, what must be the sum of \\(A \\times B \\times C\\)?\n$$\nB: \\underline{\\phantom{X}}\\quad 6\n\\quad C: \\underline{\\phantom{.}}\\quad 5\n\\quad \\phantom{.}D: \\underline{\\phantom{\\sum}}\\quad 6\n$$\n1.

To determine which choice has the least amount of total food, we need to find out precisely what is meant by 'food'.\n\n2. Examining the given choices, we note that each has a kind of food the other doesn't.\n\n3.'sardine' refers to a kind of food that is fish, but A: large sardines and C: small sardines are a different kind of food, which is sharks.\n\n4. B: large squid, D: large squid, and E: sardine are all fish.\n\n5.

Choices: A: eyes B: ears C: hands D: nose E: smile\nRationales:  1. Analyze the context to determine what the artist is painting on. A canvas is a piece of fabric that serves as a surface for painting and drawing. The choice 'A: eyes' would be suitable if the artist's canvas was a human face, specifically the eyes.\n2. In fact, the other options would be inconsistent with a canvas because the artist does not typically \"paint\" with the actual part of the body (like a nose or a hand), but with the canvas itself (like paint).\n3. Thus, the answer is 'A: eyes'\n\nAnswer: A: eyes\n\nInput: You need to remove any trace of a toxic. Choices: A: poison B: reminder C: remover D: pollutant E: harmful\nRationales: Analyze the situation to understand the task you're assigned. If the instructions ask to \"remove any trace\", the phrase \"any trace\" indicates that you must get rid of a residue or remainder of a toxic. The options \"reminder\", \"remover\", and \"polluant\" could possibly refer to any residue or remainder of the indicated toxics. However, they are unlikely because these toxics are typically not associated with any significant or major residue or remainder.  The most likely answer is \"B: poison\" because poisons typically produce significant residue.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: Which direction is the most accurate when locating a certain address (Avenue, Street, Boulevard)?

Choices: .A: floor plan B: kitchen C: bathroom D: stairway E: roof\nRationales:\n1. The statement states that an architect would design an interior for a house. So, we need an object that houses people, families, or occupants.\n2. So, looking at the answers, we're seeking a place of residence, such as a kitchen, bathroom, floor, or roof where occupants can be found.\n3 This is not the same as selecting a place of storage.\n4. Considering all the answers, we can rule out 'A-B : kitchen-bathroom' as these are places that people might store furniture or belongings in (and maybe even prepare or store food) rather than places they usually live in.\n5. Similarly, option C: stairway refers to a place to store belongings more than the place of residence.\n6. This further leaves us with the answer as D: roof which is a place of residence or living.\n7. Hence answer D is the correct one.\nAnswer: D.Roof", "answer": "D: unhappy"}

Choices A: African continent B: Asian continent C: Indian subcontinent D: Pacific ocean E: Indian ocean\nRationales 1. The question asks where we can find elephants.\n2. The word \u201clikely\u201d indicates that the answer will be a location where elephants are commonly found.\n3. Of the choices provided, we see that elephants are commonly associated with the Asian or African continents, or the Indian subcontinent.\n4. Elephants are also sea animals, so they are more likely to be found in the Indian or Pacific oceans or seas.\n5. However, the question provides a context where \u201celephant\u201d is associated with \u201cIndian\u201d and \u201cliving\u201d. This context indicates that Indians were referring to elephants located in India or Asian continents.\n6. Hence, our analysis indicates that it\u2019s more likely to find elephants in Asian or Indian continents.\n7. Therefore the answer to the question is C: Indian subcontinental.\nAnswer: C : Indian subcontinent\n\nInput: Which is better to eat with a knife and fork? Choices A: eggs B: bacon C: steak D: vegetables E: salad\nRationales \n1. The question asks which type of food we can eat with a knife.\n2. We know that a knife can be used to cut, or eat.\n3. We can eat different types of foods with a knife and a fork.\n4. The word \u201cbetter\u201d indicates we will choose food that is easier to consume with a knife, which is not always best to eat with a fork.\n5. So we must choose a food that is easiest to eat using a knife.\n6. Most of the given choices can be eaten with a knife. But there are only two of them that are not necessarily best to eat with a knifes \u2013 vegetables and sal", "answer": "E: eat corn"}

Choices: A: racecar driver B: motorist C: racer D: driver\nRationales: First, we can break down the question into three smaller component questions:\n- What is someone who is an expert at driving sports car called?- What can be used to refer to someone who is an expert?- What can be called a driver?\nWe want a word that is synonymous with 'expert' and, simultaneously, refers to'sports car' or 'any car.' We should then be able to choose a noun from the choices that is synonymous with the word 'driver' that is applicable to an expert behind the wheel of a automobile.'\nOption A (\"racecar driver\") is not suitable for multiple reasons:- The phrase \"race car driver\" has the connotation of being an expert at being a racer, as the word \"race\" describes a racer and therefore is not the correct word, it refers to expertise in racing. This is not the correct interpretation of the context of the question.\n\nOption B (\"motorist\") is not suitable for the same reason as above and for an additional one:- The phrase \"motorist\" would generally refer to someone who drives a truck as opposed to a race car, therefore it is not suitable.\n\nOption C (\"racer\") does not make sense in the context of the question either. 'Racer' is a noun describing a person who races cars or other vehicles. 'Race car' is an adjective describing a car that is used in a race, therefore the options are completely contradictory to each other.\n\nOption D (\"driver\") is suitable, because it is a noun describing the person who is driving, it does not limit itself to sports/fast cars and is synonymous with \"expert\" as a person who is skilled.\n\nAnswer: D: driver\n\nInput: A bachelor can only marry one person at a time, where will he wed?

Choices:  the park A: swings B: merry-go-round C: benches D: birds E: hiking trail\nRationales:\t1. The question mentions things that \"you can find\" or things present in a park.\n2. Accordingly, we can deduce that the answer consists of options present in a park or something one can find inside the park.\n3. Since there are no things within a park that a person is \"not allowed to find\" or cannot find, we have to eliminate that option.\n4. Thus we can cross \"the park\" out of our list of options.\n5. Next, we look at \"A: swings\" which could be a good thing to find in a park. However, this is not a thing in itself. It is a piece of equipment used in a park and not a specific thing like bird.\n6. Therefore \"A: swings\u201d can be eliminated.\n7. Similarly, \"B: merry-go round\" being another piece of equipment is not the correct option of things a person can find in a park. Therefore, it should be eliminated along with an option like \"benches\" that can be considered a piece of park equipment.\n8. So, the options left are either \"C: birds\" or \"D: hiking trail\".\n9. We know that the answer is in the form of a plural noun, so that means that it's an item a person can find more than one example of.\n10. A hiking trail is a single entity, so we can rule it out as the correct answer.\n11. Therefore, since we know that the noun is plural and that we are looking for things present in a park to find, we must be looking for the types of animals that can be found there.\n12. Since a park is typically populated with birds, we can conclude that birds would be things that we can find in a park, which makes \"C: birds\" the correct answer choice.\nAnswer: C; birds\n\nInput: Where did the crane go?

These terms can mean anything that looks similar, such as: a type of food, bird, aquatic creature from air, etc.\n3. Thus, we have to infer the meaning of these terms by eliminating the options.\nLook in the air:\nThe term 'look in the air' is asking about a creature.\nTherefore, the options: bird, fish, catfish, etc. are correct, while parakeet is incorrect.\nLook in:\nThe term 'Look in' is asking about a food or aquatic creature.\nTherefore the options: trout is wrong, while the other options (fish, catfish) are correct.\nAnswer: 1.

Choices:  a: water b: her glasses c: her face d: her eyes e: her hair\nRationales: She used a lense that allowed her to see something she would usually not be able to see, what did this lense do? Choices:\n1.  When she used the lens, she could now see water. Option a, water, would be a correct option if the question had read \"What did the water allow her to see?\" instead. But the question did not say \"water\" allowed her to see something, it said \"what\" did the lens allow..\n2.  We can rule out \"her glasses\" because a lense allows her to see only 1 location. It does not grant her the ability to see multiple locations at once.\n3.  Option \"her face\" would make sense if the lense was making her face appear bigger. But this would not make it bigger, just more visible. The lense only allows for her to see more of her face, it does not make it appear more visible. So we can rule this option out as well.\n4.  The lense allows for her to see inside of her eyes. It is not an external lense so the option that does not include the word \"external\" would be the correct option.\n5. Therefore \"her eyes\" would be the correct answer.\n6. One can argue that \"her eyes allow her to see her eyelashes\" but that is a side affect/side bonus that was not mentioned by the question, but not necessary for the answer.\n7. Note that the lense is used to \"see that which usually she is unable to\", not see her eyelids.\n8. Therefore, the answer would be \"her eyes\".\nAnswer: E: Her eyes\n\nInput: The shark is very intelligent. The most difficult thing to figure out about sharks is what?

This is correct because the man could not find anywhere to park.\n4. This is incorrect because even though the man had to park in the part of the store that customer enter, it is not the reason he could not find a parking spot in the first place.\n5.

The word \u2018certain\u2019 implies that there are multiple topics.\n1. The options A-D all revolve around the usage of different printed media.\n2. From the context, we know that we want to find information about a topic on a particular occasion or need. This does not fit the need of most of these options.\n3. When browsing through A: library or B: internet, you may find the information you need but also a lot of other things.\n4. If you wanted specific information on a specific topic, the chances to find it on A: library or B internet may seem difficult.\n5. These printed media can be an overwhelming source of information that may not be exactly what we need at that time.\n6. Hence, D option may serve us better as it only gives us what we need.\n7.

The correct sequence of number should be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 to find the largest magnitude.\n2. Magnitude should be in magnitude of thousands followed by the magnitude of hundreds. In this example: 9(10^2) > 3(10^3) > 6 (10^3)\n3.

A: small plastic replica of a statue \n2. B: metal plate for table or counter\n3. C: life-size wooden statue\n4. D: bronze statue\n5. E: marble statue\n\nRationales:\n1. The problem statement indicates that the artist's sculpture is so heavy it is on the floor.\n2. Consideration of the choices available to us reveals that only D: bronze statue and E: marble statue are heavy metals.\n3. However, option 'E' is also not applicable to the statement for the reason that the sculpture is said to be on the floor. And in general, marble is not often found on flooring.\n4. As we narrow the possible answer choices, we realize that the only remaining option is D: bronze statue.\n5. This is because 'the floor' would not support metal plate for table or a counter. In addition to 'floor' being the description of the location where the sculpture's on, a'marble' sculpture is also more likely on a floor than a table.\n6. This reduces the options to A, B, C, and E, but the combination of 'heavy' + 'on the floor' does not apply with A: small plastic reproductions as they are not heavy nor are they placed on floors.\n7. Similarly, the same is true with options B: metal plate for tables, and option C: life-size statues. \n8. So, the answer can be narrowed to A: small plastic statue or E: marble replicas, and finally A: small plastic statues.\n9. As a result, the answer is A.\n\nAnswer: A: small plastic sculpture\n\n*The answer to this question might not be immediately obvious just by looking at the question. The answer choices offered do not align with the key information provided in the question (they can be ignored). The correct answer is a small plastic sculpture.

Choices:  A) ocean's path B) ocean is not safe C) the ocean itself D) ocean is risky E) there will be a curve\nRationales: The sentence is describing the path of the ocean (i.e. the water) passing near a curve on the road. \n5. Since the ocean's path is near the curve, and we can see that it's dangerous to go into the ocean itself, we must conclude that it is dangerous to drive into the path of the ocean's path. \n\nInput: There is a chance that the airplane is going to crash if they come too close to a mountain, if they came to close to what else would the airplane likely crash into in addition to the mountain.

E: short\nRationales:  1. The question revolved around the animals termed 'ant'.\n2. The options provided deal with the characteristics of animal size.\n2. Ants are a type of animal that typically have a very small size.\n3. Therefore, if an ant is usually a certain attribute, it would be best to identify this as a small animal.\n3. So, the correct sentence formulation should be: \"Ants are [some] kind of animal because they are [some] small.\"\n3. This implies that \"Ants are small because they are animals.\"\n3. The options listed in the context of an answer to this statement are: 1. Big, 2. Largest, 3. Biggest, 4. Bigest, 5. Heavy, 6. Short. 7. Very Small, 8. Tiny, 9. Minor.\n5. We rule out all the options that have a negative relationship with animals.\n5. For example, 'bigest' means that it's big.\n5. And so, it would not be compatible with the term 'animal' because it would imply opposite to 'animal' which is the fact that \"Ants are [something] because they are animals.\" 7. Similarly, 'bigest' would make'small' impossible in the context because 'animal' must appear beforehand.\n8. We're left with 'ant is usually': 1. Small, 2. Smallest, 3. Smallest, 4. Very Small, 5. Tiny, 6. Minor, 7. Minor.\n8. 'Small' and 'Very Small' are both fitting because this is the common characteristic of an ant relative to other animal types.\n8. 'Tiny' and 'Minor' are not appropriate because: 1. An individual animal cannot be 'tiny' because ant is more of a common class of animals.\n8. An entire class of animals cannot also be'minor' because this term implies a lack", "answer": "B: whorehouse"}

Choices:  A; upwards B; downwards C; farther D; higher E; taller\nRationales: In the context of the given statement (I can show you that a RABBIT can JUMP higher than a CAT can Pounce.), Rabbit\u2019s jump is the only one that can be higher and pouncing by cat would be downwards compared to rabbit's jump. There are no possible cases of a Cat jumping higher than a rabbit.\nAnswer : C \u2013 higher\n\nInput: \"How the tables were turned\" means what? Choices: A: everything became reversed  B: everything went according to plan  C: the tables were upside down  D: the tables had legs on both sides  E: the tables came to some advantage\nRationales: \u201cTables\u201d is referring to people and \"How the tables were TURNED\" means how, people\u2019s behaviour, actions and attitudes shifted, changed or turned.\nOption A - The wording \u2018behaviour, attitude, direction,\u2026\u2019 is more suggestive of a situation where everything is reversed or reversing. It fits the opposite meaning of turned.\nOption B - The wording \u2018what you are expecting\u2019 implies a situation where something happens according to, or in accordance to, the plan or expectations. It doesn\u2019t fit the given statement.\nOption C - \u2018Tables are inverted\u2019 is quite similar to option A as it also suggests that everything is reversed.\nOption D - \u2018How the tables become upside down\u2019 fits the meaning of the statement but its given description (\u2018how people\u2019s behaviour,..\u2019) doesn\u2019t quite fit with the tables (the person is still in the picture, though, they might be turned upside down.)\nOption E - Tables might come to some advantage but not the opposite meaning. \u2018Tables become to some advantage\u2019", "answer": "A: blisters"}

Options A, B, C, D, and E provide answers which describe places that are not likely to be where a person lost a car, instead they are places that an experienced driver should be able to get their car through.\n\nAnswer:\nThe answer is C \u2013 A \"hedge\" is a place where a person could lose their car, as it can be difficult to get through, while the options A, B, and D do not clearly state the possibility of losing a car.\n\nAnswer: C \u2013 Hedge maze\n\nInput: The city is built in a unique fashion; the buildings are what? Choices A - B - C - D - E\nAnswer:\nAnswer: C \u2013 In this answer, the \"buildings\" can refer to a \"style,\" as it makes sense for the wording \"style of construction.\"  This answer is correct because it does not refer to a specific function or usage of a building, such as A \u2013 B \u2013 C, which would require a concrete response.  Instead, C is a \"style of construction,\" and does not refer to a building's purpose.\n\nAnswer: D \u2013 The city being unique seems to make sense for the meaning of this answer, as it does not refer to something obvious like a specific structure that is built by one specific person.\n\nAnswer: E - While it appears that E would be the correct answer due to it being a large structure, it does not fit in with the unique style of construction as described in choice C (as choice C requires a specific style to be built, while E being a \"building\" in its own right makes it ineligible).\n\nAnswer: A \u2013 This option is actually the right answer, as it does fit the question.

Choices: \nA: through walls B: out of doors C: through roof D: in a doorway E: through a hole\nRationales:\n   1. The question mentions that a mouse has to leave a room and asks, \"What is the most likely way that such an object will leave a room?\"\n   2. We can infer from the question that a mouse is contained inside the room and has to leave sometime.\n   3. We can further deduce from the question that one of the five given options, 'A' through 'E', describes how a mouse could possibly leave the room.\n   4. The question also asks for the most likely way. We need to consider what is probable and what is not.\n   5. We know that a mouse is inside the room and that it cannot fly. None of the given options supports this statement, except for 'E: through a door'.\n   6. In addition, the statement is not likely applicable for any of the other options because they refer to other entities than mice or their behavior. For example, Option A describes a method to exit a room using the wall as the object of the exit path. It does not apply to mice that are not built to climb or walk on walls. \n   7. Option B: 'out of doors', while the most probable way for a mouse to exit the room, is also not an option as it does not involve a door.\n   8. Similarly, Option D: 'in a doorway', is also a possibility but the question asks about the most likely way. If a mouse was in a doorway, its likely way out wouldn't be through the doorway.\n   9. Option C: 'through roof' is also not the most likely way, as we know that mice live on the floor.\n   10. Hence, the answer to the question is Option E: 'through a door'.  \nAnswer:  E: through a door.\n\nInput: Which word was the last to be changed from an old form?

Choices: A: light and fluffy B: unforgettable C: crispy D: ordinary E: tasteless\nRationales: The question is asking about the chef prepared food, and whatever she did to it made it seem hard to distinguish from the rest. \n4. Given the option, we can infer that we must describe the food in some other sense rather than its taste or texture. \n2. Considering the options, 'unforgettable' has the word 'unforgettable'.\n3. Also, 'Light' and 'fluffy' has the word 'little'.\n4. And 'Crispy' and 'ordinary' has the word 'hard'.\n5.

If he couldn't afford to pay, answer choices should be along these lines.\n 1. It's a business, they make money by selling things so that they can afford more than what they currently have in, but that means that he hasn't got enough money to buy everyone what they are about to take.\n 2.

Out of the given options, if you think about the answer, the king didn't have any of these. They are all part of mood. We should know these first.\n4.

Choices:  A. jungles B. deserts C. mountains D. caves E. forests\nRationales: We know that dogs do exist in jungles, deserts, mountains, and caves. This can be inferred from their natural habitat and the fact that they are omnipresent through several continents. Different breeds have their natural habitats which can further be categorized as tropical, subarctic, or polar. From deserts, we can infer sand. The jungle or the forest would not require the dog to be able to swim in order to navigate through the water bodies. Jungles are made of trees, which would require climbing ability to be navigable. Forests have trees and are also categorized as tropical and sub-arctic or polar regions. A mountain is any natural formation in the surface but is a difficult terrain to hike.

The word \u201cnutritious\u201d appears in parentheses suggesting that this question is about the restaurant, and not the food itself.\n3. From the given options A: moutains B: gardens C: farms, we can eliminate the first two options since they do not contain information about food at a restaurant.\n4. The word \u201criver\u201d can refer to the food at a restaurant being transported by a river, but since the words \u201cfarms\u201d and \u201cvegetable patch\u201d are used in the questions sentence without being used in parentheses, we can assume that these are options referring to the place of origin of the food.\n5. The context further allows us to eliminate options D: river and E: vegetable patch since river transportation would not be associated with farms or vegetable gardening. Farm food is more likely to be found on \u201cfarms\u201d, while \u201cvegetable patches\u201d would have a different flavor profile and ingredients which would not match with \u201cnutritious\u201d.\n6.

Choices:  I: a person II: your boss III: someone you love IV: a friend V: yourself\nRationales:1. The first part of the question is asking what (I) can tell you what you did in different environments. \n2. While all the options do reveal information, they seem to reveal unrelated and irrelevant information for the purpose of the rest of the question. \n3. The answer seems to be a very literal or straightforward answer like 'a person' which cannot possibly reveal information related to what you did in different types of situations. \n4. It makes more sense to select 'yourself' as the likely person who can tell you about your behaviour in different environments.  You cannot tell another person about your behaviour, which means you must be the one to determine your behaviour. \n5. As a result, the answer must be a person but that person must be yourself. A self-referencing answer. \n6. Thus, the likely answer choice is II: yourself. \nAnswer: II: yourself\n\nInput: The children were doing a fun jig, what is a jig? Choices: 1. a group 2. an activity 3. a move 4.a dance 5. a song 6. a jump\nRationales: The children were doing 'a fun jig' which implies that a jig is something they were doing.\nA jig is a type of dance\n'A dance' could be a formal or informal dance like 'The Charleston' or 'The Electric Slide'\n'A jig' cannot be either of these as it is already an informal dance.\nThe context of the situation is informal.\nAn informal dance cannot be either of 'The Charleston', 'The Electric Slide', etc.\nThe children are 'doing a fun jig' and a \"fun\" jig is unlikely to be either 'The Charleston,' or 'The Electric Slag'.\nHence, we can deduce that 'A jig' must be an 'informal dance' which is a type of 'dance'.\nThus, the answer is 'A dance", "answer": "B: see light"}

The answer: dinner.\nRationales: The question revolves around what happens after dinner during the night.\n1. \"After the first of the night\" is an idiomatic way of saying after midnight or the beginning of the following day.\n2. To avoid overlaps, we take only valid options for night activities such as going to sleep.\n3. \"Going to bed\" would refer to sleeping, and hence it is not a valid possibility.\n4. \"Getting ready for bed\" would refer to preparations for going to bed, and hence it is also not a suitable answer.\n5. Thus, only \"getting ready for sleep\" remains as the correct answer for this question.\nAnswer: ANSWER", "answer": "A: restaurant"}

Choices: B: mini  C: short  D: small  E: dwarf\nRationales: The main statement was \"one way of describing a very tiny, short person would be... \"\n5. It suggests that a small people is a very tiny people. However, we can also use small to describe short people and even people of average height.\n6. Therefore we have a few options.\n6. We can use B: mini, C: Short, D: Small, and E: dwarf.\n7. However, mini implies very small. Small does not. Dwarf does, but it is not typically used to describe very small and compact people.\n8. Therefore we have A and E.\n8. A is the most preferred one, because it is an actual, true description of a very small and compact people and therefor the most valid choice is A: DWARF.\nAnswer: A: DWARVES.\n\n### Input:  The machine was very intricat, it was quite an... E: implement\nRationale: 1. This indicates that there is a contextual meaning to the word \"intricate.\"\n2. The options do not include a word that refers to a complex mechanical device.\n3. It also may be a context to not include the word'machine'.\n4. Since the statement reads '...very intricate...' the answer must be very intricate or 'intricate'\n5. The word 'apparatus' is an apparatus which is a'machine that performs an operation.'\n6. However, The word \"apparatus\" also refers to something that is highly complex or 'intricate.'\n7. So the most appropriate answer is 'B: Apparatus'\n\n### Input:(D: wash dishes) E: Implement\nRationale: \n\n### Input (B: Apparatus D: wash dish) E: Implement \n\n### Answer (A: Apparatus)\n\n### Input ((A) box D: wash dough E: implement )\nRationale:  -", "answer": "C: san francisco"}

Choices:  L: in the morning B: in the afternoon C: in the evening D: all the time. E: at any time\nRationales: The question revolves around determining which time out of the given options we could find water in a stream.\n1. We can eliminate D: 'all the time' because it's too broad as an answer.\n2. Since the answer options are in the afternoon, evening, and morning during which time of day is it possible to say that there is water in the stream?\n3. The answer, then, must be in the afternoons because the time of day to detect water in the stream is 'in the afternoon'.\nAnswer: A: in the afternoon\n\nInput: Where can a pony live for years? Choices:  G: in a stable H: in a pasture I: in a stable or pasture J: anywhere \nRationales: We have the problem statement: A pony can live for years anywhere.

Choices: A: ocean B: sea C: lake D: ocean and sea E: water\nRationales: From the context, we see that an aquarium is a type of sea animal. We can deduce that if an aquarium is a'sea animal', then the'sea' it is contained in must be larger than an aquarium, such as an ocean or a lake.\n\nInput: What is the difference between a bull and a moose?

Choices: A: learning to write B: learning math C: learning math and literature D: learning science E: learning literacy\nRationales:1. The question is looking to determine what the student was talking about.\n2. Accordingly, all choices provided refer to different subjects.\n3. Hence, considering the first sentence, we know that option A: \"learning to write\" is out of the scope of this question.\n4. Similarly, option B: \"learning math\" does not seem to apply as the sentence suggests \"literature\" and not \"math\" as the subject.\n5. Thus, we can rule out Options A and B.\n6. Options C (math and literature) and D (science) deal with two non-sequential combinations of subjects. For example, not learning \"writing\" followed by \"math,\" not learning \"math\" followed by \"literature\", not learning \"writing and math,\" not learning \"literature and math.\"\n7. Option E, \"learning literacy,\" is the only remaining choice that applies to all the subjects specified together.\n8.

For the first class that week, he was teaching which of the following? Choices: A) biology B) history C) math D) writing\nRationales:\n1. The question is about what subject(s) the professor teaches.\n2. The word \"many\" in the sentence suggests he might have teach many subjects and not just one.\n3. Therefore, options A (biology), B (history), and D (writing), the answers to which are singular, are eliminated.\n4. Option E (math), which has the same singular format, does not make sense as the professor is teaching many subjects and not a single one.\n5. So, the answer to the problem is C: Math.\nAnswer: C) Math.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the relationship between the two sentences in this passage?\n\nOption A: B: they are two parts of the same sentence", "answer": "D: become tired"}

Which one describes the traveling of a chatterbox's message? Choices: 1. A: light orbs 2. B: sparkling particles 3. C: vibrant vapors 4. D: clear thoughts E: floating air\nRationales: Analyzing the problem statement, we know that a chatterbox' traveling message can easily travel or is hard to stop.\n\nTherefore, the words used to describe this can be: clear, floating, vibrant, and sparkling, as these words depict speed and movement of the message sent by a chatterbox. So options A, B, C, and D are the possible words to describe the message sent by a Chatterbox.\n\nAnswer: B: Sparkling Particles\n\nInput: We are not sure when it will rain. It has been _______ for some time now. Choices:  A. sunny B. nice C. cloudy D. cold E. bright\nRationales: Considering the context and we know it has been cloudy since some time now \nwe can rule out A and E as an answer because it has not been sunny or bright.\n\nSo we have to select out of B, C, D.\n\nAfter thinking about it, we need to check and determine the meaning of sunny and bright.\n\nSunny -\n\\( \\begin{aligned} &Definition : \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ Sunny or sunshine refers to a day with sunshine and cloud cover. \\end{aligned} \\)\n\nThe sun is shining and the wind is gentle.

B: because a pine does not have any fruit 3. C: because a pine is an evergreen tree with a pineapple at its top D: because the pineapple is an evergreen tree 4. E:because a pineapple cannot grow without seeds.\nRationales: Analyze: Because a pineapple is an (ever)green tree that produces fruit, a pineapple has fruit. 1 and 2 would not fit because the pineapple and pine are not comparable. The question is not about the pine, but about the pineapple. 3 and 4 are the most correct answer.\nAnswer: 3 and 4.\n\nInput: One pizza can be two types of cheese.

Choices:  C: rocks D: gravel E: mud F: stones G: snow\nRationales: We can rule out 'G: snow' because it isn't appropriate for such a question.\n\n1. The only places where snow might be found are mountains or glaciers, but'snow' is not a liquid that one can walk through.\n2. We can also rule out 'B: gravel' because gravel is a coarse mixture containing a variety of materials, including stones, and is thus an improper answer.\n3. We can rule out BD: gravel and rocks because they're also an inappropriate answer. Similarly, 'G: snow' is also not appropriate.\n4. This leaves us with A: 'Rocks', C: 'rocks', D: 'Rocks'.\n5. Since 'rocky surface' implies that there are rocks, the answer must be either option A, C, or D.\n6. However, both options A and B describe small rocks that are too small to be walked on. Similarly, 'the cobbles' implies bigger rocks, and BD: Gravel and Rocks is only smaller rocks again.\n7. Thus, the answer is D.\n \n\n### Instructions:", "answer": "E: building"}

Choices: A: pen B: paintbrush C: computer D: scissors E: ruler\nRationales: Generally, in artistic contexts, there are many instruments used by artists, which may include a paintbrush, a pen, a scissors, a ruler, etc.  Hence, the options available are broad in the sense that these are all valid answers that we should be aware of in the first place.\n1. The question is concerned with the object referred to in the word \"them\".\n2. Since it is referring to objects in general, we need to check the options for similarities that will narrow down the candidates to a single one.\n3. If we find an option that is more general, then the other options need to be compared based on more specific specificity.\n4. For instance, among the given choices, 'pen' is a more general term than'scissors' and 'e'.\n5. Also, the term'scissors' is more specific than the term 'pen'.\n6. Hence, pen, scissors, and e, need to be further compared based on specificity.\n7. This is aided by the fact that some objects are better described by the word \"what\" than by others.\n8. For instance, \"pen\" can be either a ballpoint, fountain pen, etc. Also, the question is not referring to a material such as \"wood\" \"clay\" that would describe the pen. Hence, the options left are 'pen' and'scissors' because the word 'what' is used for them.\n9. However,'scissors' also encompasses cutting actions and is too general for our needs in this question.\n10. Moreover, 'pen' still has the same issue as it includes many items.\n11. Hence, the only remaining option that has both these features is'scissors' that is more specific than other options in the sense that it includes only the artistic object.\n12. Thus we can conclude that the answer is'scissors', as only this option is more specific than the", "answer": "A: port"}

Choices:  Tumbleweed is a term only known in North American English.\nRationales:\n1. The sentence suggests that the terms 'tumbleweed' is only known in North American or English dialects. \n2. We know that tumbleweed is a type of a drifting bushy plant.\n3. In context, a tumbleweed is not a singular tree or a shrub. It's instead a type of bushy plant, typically growing in arid grasslands. \n4. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A: Tumbleweed is only known in North-American English.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: What time do people usually do yoga? Choices:  At night is the right time. At night in particular is usually when people do yoga.\nRationales 1. The sentence suggests yoga is a kind of activity performed at night.\n2. The phrase \"usually when people do yoga is performed at night\" implies that yoga is a night exercise. The sentence can be restated \"normally or conventionally people do yoga at night\" thus \"at night\" is the right time for people to do yoga. \n3. In contrast, the sentence \"yoga is usually performed at night in places like gymnasiums and spas\" suggests that yoga is a kind activity that can be done anywhere. It's not limited to night hours.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that a more proper restatement should be \"yoga is usually done at night in gymnasiums and spa's\".\nAnswer: D", "answer": "A: new york"}

Of these, only 'Ireland' can be a nation known for its use of sheeps.\n3. However, if it was Ireland, they would be known for their dairy cattle. Although Ireland is known for the dairy production, sheep are not commonly found there.\n4. The same logic applies to the Ireland reference in point 2.\n5. Thus, it is New Zealand that knows for its use of sheep. Ireland and New Zealand share the dairy cattle reference, but the use of sheep is relevant here.\n6. Based on what's mentioned above, we can conclude that New Zealand is the only nation in the list that can be known for its use of Sheep.\n7.

Choices:  D: oven B: kitchen C: frying pan E: barrel\nRationales: In this question, the cake looks delicious. The cake looks delicious because where did they bake the cake. The delicious cake was baked in what? We cannot say that cake is delicious because of the ingredient used because, in this context, cake looks delicious on its own, so there's no need for any ingredient.\n\nWe can then assume that cake looks delicious, because of its presentation or because it is made from the ingredient that looks delicious or because it was made with the equipment that looks delicious.\n\nTherefore, \"where did they bake it\" refers to the equipment and not the person that baked it.\n\nThis makes all the choices incorrect because the answers are about the tools or equipment in the kitchen and none of those options sound delicious.\n\nOnly oven, kitchen, frying pan and barrel sound delicious, therefore the correct or most likely answer is \"they baked it in the oven\".\n\nAnswer: A: Oven\n\nInput: Where did they place the baboon, the zoo?

Choices:  A internet B text message C mobile phone D laptop H phone\nRationales:\n1. Whenever we have to answer multiple choice questions with a verb in the blank, it is important to understand the grammatical structure of the sentence. \n2. In this sentence, the verb in the blank is present:  'is' and it is the active voice. \n3. The verb implies an action by a subject. In this sentence, 'be', the subject and object are implied. \n4. The subject is 'people' which refers to the people who are being addressed, not necessarily the readers or question askers, as 'being' is a present tense verb which expresses action in the present.\n5. Also, as the answer choices provide a lot of information on the type of device, it is important to analyze the options and decide which one would fit the grammatical structure. \n6. The 'laptop' answer choice contradicts the information contained in the question. \n7. The device mentioned, 'new technology', must be a device that provides two way communication, it cannot just be a laptop which provides data communication.\n8. Likewise, the laptop also does not provide data communication, but does provide the capability for texting and data communication. \n9. Therefore, we can consider the option with the most accurate technical description of two way communication \u2013 option B.\n10.

Choices:  B. close window A. shut door C. open window B. bake more D. throw something out E. put out fire\nRationales:\n1. The question contains two scenarios: one mentioning the man's effort to make food when a fire broke out, and the other about the fire happening while making food.\n2. The second part of the problem statement asks us to ascertain what type of reaction should be given by the man to put out the fire. But since it is not a given that this was the circumstance, I will proceed without the prejudice that the fire broke out while cooking.\n3. The possible reactions the man could make are:\n    * A. close window to stop the fire spreading.\n    * B. shut door to stop the fire spread.\n    * C. open window to let out the fire.\n    * D. throw something out that can stop the fire.\n    This leaves us with four logical options to think about which are B, C, D, and E.\n4. But we can eliminate Options B, C, and E by referring to the other aspect of the question: the man is preparing food and has put effort and ingredients into it and would not like to throw out much of it, in case the fire could have been stopped.\n5. Option B: close window, does not seem relevant for a scenario where food is being prepared.\n6. Option C: open window, also seems irrelevant because the man who put in a lot of effort to cook would not want to be so wasteful and throw much of the ingredients that he invested effort in.\n7. This leaves us with options D (throw something out) and E (put out the fire). \n8. Choosing the appropriate option can be done rationally by considering this:\n    * Option E: put out the fire only means that the man can extinguish the fire.

A: clockwise B: counterclockwise C: anticlockwise D: counterclockwise E: anti-clockwise\nRationales:1. The question asks about how the tuck box can be opened. The direction the key has to be turned to open the box is important.\n2. Looking through the given choices. We see that the given options consist of the words 'clockwise' and 'anticlockwise'. \n3. Clockwise and anti-clockwise are not different, but opposites in the context of turning a clock.\n4. Therefore, both are invalid as the right direction here is neither clockwise nor anti-clockwise.\n5. The direction required to open the box is 'counterclockwise'. Therefore, the answer to this question is choice C: counterclockwise.\nAnswer: B2: counterclockwise\n\nInput: Where did the group of friends go next?

The most likely item would be the nuts from the squirrel's stash.\nThere", "answer": "C: london"}

Choices: A: engineering B: literature C: business D: physics E: science\nRationales: This question wants to determine the field in which the student who passed this class will study. \n\n1. The question explicitly states that in 'this class', a student passed. There could be other reasons, such as because I aced the entire class or I've made progress in an area other than academics or anything else. \n2. We don't have any other context that provides more specific information to the class the student passed.\n3. Since it's not clear why the student got a passing grade, we can assume that it was because he or she gained a good grade in this class.\n4. Given all this, the only field that fits our requirements is 'academics'.\n5. The student is studying what is related to 'class' and the topic of the class is what he has to study.\n6. Therefore the answer is 'business' as the student will be studying business.\nAnswer: B. business\n\nInput: Why is the frog's throat different from frogs of other types? Choices: 1.

{"text": "ability.\n7. Therefore the best candidate choice is E: tree.\nAnswer: E Tree\n\nInput: Which of these is the most dangerous? Choices:  Mistakes A: accident B: error C: problem D: mistake\nRationales: Here we can see that there are two different kinds of mistakes highlighted in the problem statement, which gives us additional information to identify the correct answer. It says: \"which of these is the most _______?\" which implies that we can infer which of the choices \"mistakes\" is more similar in meaning to, in order to get the correct response.  \"Mistake\" can mean a \"misstep\" or error in thinking.  \"Accident\" is when there's an unforeseen event that results in harming an individual or thing.  \"Error\" implies a deliberate action of negligence that results in harm.  \"Problem\" is when a thing or individual is not ideal or acceptable. \"Mistake\" is often used to refer to negligent acts that result in harmful outcomes, which aligns with the description given in the question.  Therefore, the choice that most accurately represents an intentional misstep that leads to harm is \"error\" as opposed to \"mistakes\", since \"mistake\" on it\u2019s own can also be simply a misstep. The other options do not have a similar definition in this context. Answer A: accident\n\nInput: How do you know that a woman is the best driver? Choices:  She has a great personality.  She's a man.  She's experienced.  She was a boyfriend.\nRationales: The description of the word \"best\" implies that the word should be used with a comparative definition. This implies that \"She\" is doing some task, which the problem statement does not specify so we need to determine what that task might be.  All that we can see from the problem statement is that \"She\" might be a driver in some sense.  We cannot get any more clarity about this other than that the driver is a woman because there's no context in the sentence in which the word \"She\" is used.  This means that \"She\" is the term used for a broad concept without any specific definition. However, just by examining the context of the problem statement, we can infer the driver is of a", "answer": "D: republican party"}

Choices: A: paddle B: oars C: kayak D: paddle board E: surfboard\nRationales:  1. First, determine what the question is asking. The man was a good-swimmer, and that's why they can navigate the lake with some object. Since the man can navigate with a certain object(s), he is not an expert in some other object.\n2. Go through the set options and find out the object which has been mentioned as an expert for the man.\n\n3. One of the option that stands out is the word \"paddle\" as it has been used along with the man in the earlier part of the question. The other option \" paddle board\" has not been used with the man so it would not qualify for the expert term. From the available options the choice \"paddle\" seems only one of the suitable choices to be mentioned by the man.\n4. Paddle is the correct answer based on the given information.\nAnswer A: paddle\n\nInput:  The man was a good student, he knew how to prepare a book for the class.  The man was good at what?

The man knows how to use a musical instrument (their expertise).\n2. That suggests that their expertise was practiced since what time?\n\n3. The choices between A to L are the only ones that make sense (out of 1000000 possible combinations).\n4. The question is about the man who can't read, write, or draw.\n\n5.

A: tree 2. B: couch 3. C: box 4. D: ladder 5. E: blanket\nRationales: The problem statement implies that cats could, on average, climb things that are not in a downward direction. This is to say that cats are not disposed to climbing things that are headed downward unless they're falling or doing something similar.\nThe given choices offer potential places cats could visit or be found.\nA: tree \u2013 a tree, due to its structure, does not necessarily face downward.\nIf a cat climbed the tree, depending on the placement of the tree in relation to the cat, it is possible that the cat could also climb downwards.\nTherefore, the tree is a viable option that could allow for cats to both climb up and down in certain cases.\n\nThe choices for C, D, and E: blanket \u2013 the blanket is an object that isn't on a physical form that could have a downward facing direction.\nThe blanket, like all objects, must be placed somehow. Thus, the blanket could be made to face one of any directions it might be found.\nHence, the blanket isn't the best choice because of its ambiguity as a direction-orientated physical entity.\nC and D: box and ladder \u2013 a box typically isn't oriented in the same way as a blanket, but it is physically capable of sitting in any direction it pleases.\nTherefore, if a cat climbed into a box it would only depend on the positioning of the box in relation to the other physical objects in the room to determine whether up or down were facing on the box.\nSimilarly, a ladder is a physical apparatus that if one climbs it could not only face any direction but also travel downwards as well, without the need to climb downwards from it.\nThus A, B, and especially D: ladder would be more viable.\nSince two out of the three options for the ladder question satisfy the downward non-directional condition described, we", "answer": "A: read"}

Choices: A: bucket B: hose C: water D: tank E: tube\nRationales: This example is a common use-case of a context-specific phrase. In this case, \"buy on credit\" is the phrase in question. \n1. The question doesn't make it clear if the use of the phrase is referring to the way the car got washed or the money transaction in order to pay for the wash service.\n2. If the transaction isn't at the forefront or the context isn't explicitly clarified, it's reasonable to assume that \"get washed\" only refers to how the car was cleaned.\n3. This is because \"getting washed\" as a phrase only implies a way of cleaning or getting clean.\n4. Similarly, the washing of a vehicle can be done manually using a bucket or machine using a hose.\n5. However, the washing of an individual is rarely done with buckets and hoses. Thus, bucket and hose aren't likely context-specific phrases.\n6. With that logic, we deduce that we are instead dealing with the way or machinery the car was washed.\n7. It's likely that the car was washed using water. Considering the context, water tanks fit well as a reasonable answer.\n8. Hence, the answer to the question is D: water tank.\nAnswer: D; Water Tank\n\nInput: The group of people was doing something in the desert.  What were they?

On the edge of a volcano D. Upstream from a dam E. In a river\nRationales: Choices: 1. The contextual cues provided to us are water, a dam, and a volcano which all could potentially be found in certain locations. 2. According to option A, we would find 'a waterfall in the forest'. A forest is a type of place to find a waterfall, meaning this isn't necessarily a description of a waterfall. 3. Option B: 'downstream from a dam' is also incorrect because it implies the waterfall is at the location of the dam. Therefore, since we have already eliminated the two options A and B, we are left with three others. 4. In option C (on the edge of a volcanic area or volcano) we would find a waterfall if we were on an edge of a volcano, meaning we would have to be on or near a volcano to find a waterfall. 5. In option D (upstream from a dam): we would find a water fall by a waterfall, if we were upstream from a dam. 6. We can further rule out C and D by accounting for option E: 'a river' from which waterfalls naturally occur. 7.

Once he had done a rough estimate, he found out that the gay ratio between men and women is approximately 1- what? Choices: A: 12 B C: 11 D: 31 E: 30 F: 33\nRationales: The question asks how many more gay men there are than women overall. As the first line explains, this is a function of dividing up a list and counting how many crosses there are out of how many initials before deciding a cross to 4/1 ratio.  \n\nNote that if you think it is approximately 2 times more, this is also fine; this is because there could have been more men and women on the list, he just counted the ones who were there.  We know that the ratio between men and women isn't 40/1 because if his estimate is 1x, then the 40/1 would mean that there are 4x more gay men than women altogether, which we know is incorrect because he said he could only estimate it. This would also not work if he had 10 people in the list; in this case the 40/2 means there are 2x more gay men than straight men in the group overall which would not match his initial estimate.  We know this since by dividing by the group of men in the original estimate, it must equal the 4/1 in the end.\n\nTo find out more about what it means when a man's friends are gay, we can read the last sentence in the problem; he said \"Once he had done a rough estimation, he found out that he overestimated.\" This means that we can ignore the actual answer and make our own assumption that there about 1 times as many gay men as there are women.

Choices: A: sea B: canal C: lake D: river E: ocean\nRationales (A-E): 1. The question refers to canals.\n2. Canals are navigated via smaller parts of bodies of water, which can be explained for these choices in the following fashion:\n3. An \"ocean\" or a \"sea\" or a \"lake\" can all be navigated using a canal.\n4. The smaller body of water in a \"river\" is where canals are navigated using smaller vessels.\n5. Hence, all the options are relevant choices.\n6. However, when the answer is a canal that connects one water body to another, we can use the \"river\" body of water in the middle as an example.\n7. Further, canals do not navigate through \"ocean\" or \"sea\" or \"river\". They are smaller bodies that are used as a route for connecting two water bodies.\n8.

This statement implies that people generally enjoy being one thing.\n3. Option A: 'rock star' doesn't accurately reflect the statement. Many rock stars are good musicians. Option A fails to satisfy this criteria.\n4. Similarly, Options B-C-D fail to satisfy the general criteria as well.\n5. Option E:'singer' meets the criteria because there aren't many people who enjoy being singers in general. Singer is a term of trade and those who pursue it are usually people that enjoy what they do.

Answering this question requires understanding what the phrase \"other than in the garden\" actually means.\n2. The problem statement assumes that carrots are in fact harvested and found in gardens.\n3. Therefore, all the given options, barring Option-5, don't take away this fact that carrots can also be found in gardens. \n4. All of option-1, option-2 and option-3 refer to places where you can buy carrots or have access to carrots.\n5. Option-4, 'fridge' is a way to keep food and other ingredients, such as carrots, fresh. But it does not imply where carrots can be found outside a garden.\n6.

That information must be specific and precise.\nIn the example question, the sentence is incomplete.

To be 'near', one must be 'close', 'nearby', or 'adjacent'.\nIn referring to an 'on the water' location, 'water' means 'a body of water', 'ocean', 'river', 'lake', or'sea'.\n'Close' means 'by, close to, at, in, near, or near to'.\nBased on these definitions, we can eliminate 'high', 'near', and 'on the water' from the answers.\nWe can eliminate 'flat' because a 'flat' location is the opposite of 'uphill'.\nTherefore, the answer that accounts well for these facts is option C.

Since both options are plausible, to disregard any other options, we look for other clues or hints provided in the question.\n8. The word 'hands' indicates we may have to look for some kind of surface or structure that could be climbed. So, we eliminate any locations where the Marmot could not physically hold onto something or where the terrain is too rough to climb.\n9. Thus left is 'a rocky hillside'. Therefore, the answer is E: rocky hillside. \nAnswer: E: rocky hill side\n\nInput: Which of the following shows the appropriate choice in this example? Choices: A: the most comfortable for him B: the best looking C: the fastest D: the most elegant E: the finest\nRationales: The question is asking what choice the sentence in the given context is referring to.\n1. Each option is in a sentence that has 'the most' as part of the beginning.\n2. The first sentence that has 'the best looking' indicates that the correct choice is similar to 'the most' in that it describes what is considered the best or most desirable.\n3. From this inference, we can disregard all the other options because 'best' already implies a comparative level of quality.\n4. Therefore, the correct option is C: 'the fastest'.\nAnswer: C: the fastest\n\nInput: Your friend's favorite color, which is red, may be what? Choices: A. An example of the least used colors B.

Although'red' is the name of the friend's favorite colors, we do not actually know how popular or common red is in use.\n2. Thus, the options are A: An example of the least-used colors.

Choices: A: the land B: the building C: the furniture D: the estate E: the property\nRationales:1. \"The mansion was unoccupying.\" (sic) \n2. From the context, the question is asking about a building for the mansion.\n3. The choices A: the land, B: the building, C: the furniture, D: the estate, and E: the property can be used to determine which of them relates to the building.\n4. Looking carefully at the context, the answer appears to be more about the mansion's physical or tangible aspect rather than its functional or non-physical one.\n5. This eliminates choices D: the estate and E: the property.\n6. These options are describing more intangible or functional aspects of the mansion.\n7. Thus leaving us with Choices A: the land, and B: the building.\n8. The options \"land\" and \"building\" both include tangible or physical entities.\n9. The context suggests that the actual physical building or property is what was being seized by the government, not the land or the building.\n10.

Choices:  a: backhand A: service court B: serve court C: frontcourt D: front service E: forehand\nRationales: The question is asking us from the court where the woman playing tennis is hitting. \n1. We can say that this must be happening either in the serve court or the back hand service court.\n2. However, one cannot hit to a front or forehand in the service or backhand courts.\n3. So, we can eliminate D, E, A and B. Now, E is the opposite of a serve court meaning we can leave E. \n4. Further, the woman can only serve if she is in the back hand service court meaning that A and B can be discarded too. \n5. The final option that remains is C: frontcourt.\n6. In a tennis court, a frontcourt is the area right in front of the player\u2019s service court. \n7. A tennis player is then said to return a serve when they hit the ball back to their opponent from the frontcourt. \n8. Therefore, A: frontcourt is the only option that remains.\nAnswer C: frontcourt\n\n### Input: The man on the boat is what?

Choices: 1000: A: hats B: flowers C: wood D: food\nRationales: From the beginning of the problem, we see a gnome is looking for three items in a forest.\nFrom the list of options in the question, it is possible to determine what each item could be.\nWhile both 'a hat' and 'flowers' could be possible options for the third item, only 'flowers' could also work as one of the first two options.\nThe word 'wood' refers to the material used to make and create wood.\nThis would make more sense as one of the first items in the list.\nAdditionally, the gnome's search for the items could possibly be referring to the items in a house.\nIf we select 'wood', we get an answer like 'wood, flowers, the gnome'.\nChoosing 'wood', our answer is 'Wood, flowers, the gnomes'.\nAnswer: E: Wood, flowers, the gno...\n\nInput: The lizard's tongue can taste a variety of food, how long is it roughly about? Choices: 559: A: short B: long C: medium D: extra-long\nRationales: The lizard is able to taste a variety of food by having a long tongue, so our options should refer to how long it is.\nAll of our options here are adjectives to refer to the length of a lizard's tongue, so to answer we first need to know which parts of speech each answer is.\nThe answer is 'C' because it is the only adjective in the list that is a single adjective without being modified with another word.\nAnswer: E B/C: medium\n\nInput: What type of animal would like a pool?

Choices:  A group of young adults. A group of young ones. A group of young adult children.  A group of young people who lived under a rock.\nRationales:1. The question indicates that a teacher is talking about this school and saying how unique it was. They use the word \"study\" to imply the subject at hand.\n2. All the choices given can be classified as \"groups of young people\".\n3. So, if the teacher means to say that this school was interesting \"to study\", or in another sense, it should contain \"students\".\n4. Option A: A group of young adult, is out as in a teacher's perspective, all the students are kids so they wouldn't be \"adults\".\n5. Similarly, option B: A group of young ones is also not a good choice as it also says all the students are adults.\n6. Option C: A group of young children would be incorrect as kids aren't adults, even if they are the \"young ones\".\n7. Option D: A group of young people living under a rock would be an appropriate choice as a class would be considered young and all of them are people.\n8.

Choices:  B: he was already wearing red clothing C: he wanted to wear orange D: he could only wear green clothing\nRationales:1. The question is referring to a monster who wants to don something for himself but does not intend to do so.\n2. Based on the answers proposed, the monster is either refraining from wearing clothes due to his preference of color or is unable to wear them\n3. We are told that he \"can\" wear colors other than green.\n4. This means all the other options are wrong. Because the monster wants to wear non-green clothing, he is not wearing clothes.\n5. The only choice that allows for monster not wearing clothes without specifying some other reason is \"D: he could only wear monster clothing\"\n6. Therefore, the answer to the question is D: he could only wore monster clothing.\n\nAnswer: D: he could only monster clothing\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question using complete grammatically correct sentences.\n\n### Input: The monster is the scariest animal I have seen. \n\n### Answer: The monster is probably the scariest animal that I have seen.\n\n### Why am I able to complete this type of question?\n\n* The question provides a context. \n   * There is an identifying modifier and a following word that the modifier applies to.\n* The modifier describes and qualifies a quality unique to its noun or pronoun.\n* The question only asks for a response related to the identifying modifier. \n   * This allows context clues to be used to determine the qualification of the specific noun or pronoun based on the modifier.\n* The question provides you the option to provide additional clarification. \n   * If needed, the answer must be grammatically correct. \n   * It must also be the qualification which the modifier uniquely identifies as true. \n   * Use the provided context to explain why you can arrive at your selected answer.\n\n### References:\nhttps://www.duolingo.com/sk", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

Choices:  Elevator ____________________ escalator\nRationales: It is crucial to note that we are not given a context of who is asking this question.\n1. The answer to the question needs to match the user's context.\n2. Elevator: It's a common building fixture used for ascending and descending between multiple floors in a building.\n3. Escalator: It's also a fixture used for ascension.\n4. Escalator is faster than elevator, taking less time to use.\n5. So, if we intend to use the stairs, which will take less than five minutes for a short distance, E is our best option.\n6. The two choices provided in the question do NOT match our context.\n7. There exists two other words in the English language to imply an elevating mechanism in a building.\n8. One of them is elevator and we already eliminated that in our logical reasoning earlier.\n9. The other is lift, which fits the context of the person asking, but the word \"taking\" in the question requires a past tense that only escalator fits.\n10. So, choosing E: None of these answers is the best answer.\nAnswer: None of these.\n\nInput: Do you want salads and juice, or ice-cream and cake?

The employer says the applicant is what?\n2. The credential is a document with the requirements to apply for a job and show that you have them. We see three options about the employer's perception of the applicant, who does not have the needed credential.\n3. Option B means that the employer thinks the applicant is a liar. \n4. The job applicant did not have the credentials (the credential needed to apply for the job) and the employer says that the job applicant is a what? \n5. The job applicant may have been dishonest in his application for the job that is why the employer calls him a liar.  That is why option B is not correct. \n6. Option E means that the employer calls the job applicant a what? \n7. The job applicant is dishonest in making an application for the job. \n8. The job applicant must have been dishonesty or the what? \n9. The job applicant applies for the job with dishonest credentials by not providing the necessary or correct credentials that are applicable to job qualifications for the job.

This is unlikely to make the food complicated if you can make it that way, since cooking with animals products is very common.\nTherefore, the answer is A.\nAnswer: A : Complex dishes\n\nInput: I saw a very pretty woman walking down the street. She looked like what? Choices:A : a beautiful woman B : a beautiful woman with hair C : a stunning woman D : a beautiful woman with make up E : a beautiful woman with a good face\nRationales: The phrase \"she looked like\" indicates that the woman is not actually beautiful. \"pretty\" denotes a relative term, so it is used here to imply a relatively small degree of beauty.\nBecause \"pretty\" is a somewhat neutral descriptor and we have many options to choose from, using the options which indicate relatively high levels of beauty would lead to the logical answer of 'beautiful'. \nWe should select the \"least beautiful\" options first, as selecting the \"most beautiful\" options first can cause a chain reaction in which each successive solution is more beautiful, until a relatively attractive appearance is obtained, at which point the term \"pretty\" would no longer have any value.\nTherefore, I chose B - 'a beautiful woman with hair'.\nAnswer: B : a beautiful woman\n\nInput: I went on a cruise and was disappointed.

From the available options, which are what the problem could be, the watch was A: broken, B: stopped working, C: was dying, D: stopped working, E: was broken. The watch was broken because the batter died out. Therefore, the answer B is the correct choice.\nAnswer: B : stopped working\n\nInput: Why did your dog refuse to eat your leftover lasagna?  He doesn't like pasta Choices:  A  : He doesn't like vegetables B  : He didn't like leftovers C  : He doesn' t like meat D  : He didnt like vegetables E  : He doesn's like meat\nRationales: According to the sentence, we are trying to figure out why your dog didn't eat your leftovers. From the three options, vegetables are ruled out because your dog doesn't like them. After that, we can rule out B: He didn't like left overs because he didn't eat the leftovers, the question is about what he didn't eat, not the state or circumstance of the food. Likewise, the sentence states he didn't eat or he refused to eat the leftover lasagne, so we will rule out the option that says he doesn't like meat, because that isn't a reason why he didn't eat. The next option says he doesn't even like lasagne, but that isn't the reason he didn't like it. So all this leaves us with A; He doesn't like lasagne because of what is in it. This is the correct answer. \nAnswer: A : He doesn't eat lasagne\n\nInput: How many apples can fit in the box?  Applies is the correct answer for this question.

Choices: \t\tA: make a salad B: make a lemonade C: nothing D: crush up some crab\nRationales:\t1. The question is about something you can do with a crab.\n2. Accordingly, the only options are choices A-C.\n3. These are all physical objects so there can not be any logical or semantic combinations of items because 'You'can't do with an object.\n4. Choice B: Make lemonade is a logical combination of using the items in question together. So that's an exception.\n5. We also know that making lemonade can be considered \"doing something with\" a lemon and crab together.\n6. Thus it's very easy to conclude that a lemon and clobcombined together make a lemonade.\n7. So then, we know choice B: Make lemonada is the correct answer to this question.\nAnswer: B : Make lemonade\n\nInput: The city will be held _______________ with the news of the king. Choices:\tA: in love B: under lock and key C: in control D: in limbo\nRationales:\n1. The key piece of the question is \"the city (which will be)\" with a blank.\n2. The option that fills this place is the closest in meaning to the rest of the sentence.\n3. Since in the blank is the subject \"city\", all the answers must describe cities.\n4. Considering the structure of the given sentence, the city might be either in limbo, if it knows that something bad might be around the corner for the king, or in control if good news will be coming.\n5. Only C: in control fits this logic.\n6. The other options fail to meet this criterion.\n7. Therefore we can surmise that \"The city will be in control with the news of the King\" is the correct answer.\nAnswer: C : in control", "answer": "C: curry"}

The work featured what? Choices: A: a bird B: a fish C: an apple D: a rose E: the garden\nRationales: The question is asking the place where the artist went wrong. Since they've been asked to answer the problem, the question expects something that's wrong about the work of the artist. In other words, the problem wants a place where the artist went astray or \"went wrong\" in their work.\nLooking at the given choices, 'a bird', 'a fish', 'an apple', 'a rose', and 'the garden' can be associated with the work of the artist in different ways.\n'A bird' is a creature that would be difficult to represent in a painting, as they have complex plumage that varies with color and structure. 'A fish' could represent a different challenge in its movement. 'An apple' could mean something as trivial as not capturing the apple's appearance in the painting properly. 'A rose' is also a difficult flower to portray, and the garden could refer to the artist's failure to represent the garden's surroundings.\nThus, we conclude that the answer is 'the garden'. Option E: garden is the choice which is correct and not a place where the artist needs to be careful.\nAnswer: D - garden\n\n### Demosration:Multiple Choice Question and Open-ended\n\n![](/assets/images/exercises/1.gif)\n>The question: A car crashed last week in what area?\n>The choices : \n  * A: In the North\n  * B: In the east\n  * C: In the south\n  * D: In the west\n  * E: In the centre of the city\n \nThe rationale : The question is asking for where the car crashed.

E: a rake\nRationales:  1. Weeds are plants that may be unwanted and not suitable for the ecosystem of the garden.\n2. The context implies that the garden will be well cared for which eliminates the option A: a hoe, which is not ideal for gardens.\n3. The only other tools with the capacity to remove weeds would be a spade and a shovel because they are effective at digging into the ground without damaging the root system of the garden or crops.\n4.

The given choices B, C, D, and E all could be used to make a garden. \n2. Options B and C are tools that could potentially be used to make a farmer's garden. However, \n3. options E and B (a spade) refer specifically to gardening.

Choices: A: insulted B: rude C: harsh D: aggresive E: hateful\nRationales:\n1. People often become angry at someone because of the way they speak to them.\n2. Insulting and rude behaviors are considered speech abuses towards another person.\n3. Insulting and harsh speech could be the way one talks as a general manner of speech, but insulting and aggressive are words used to describe behaviors.\n4. Aggressive speech is usually used to describe a manner of communication rather than how one is speaking.\n5. Harsh and hateful words don't give any description about how someone is communicating, so they can't be appropriate answers.\n6. Insulting and cruel speech would be appropriate answers because people become frustrated by them in a way that describes how people are talking or speaking.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: Where did that person get the idea?

Choices:   A: help B: food C: information D: recognition E: aid\nRationales: Based on the sentence structure and the preceding sentence, it is safe to assume the problem statement is asking the next question of who the man is waiting for.\n8. Thus, let's start with the options:\n9. Option \"A: help\" does not really fit right off the bat because the word 'help' is usually associated with physical assistance/ aid. \n10. \"Aid\" (option E) is too broad to give a specific person's name while \"Recognition\" (option D) is specific to the person's achievements and might not be what the man is looking forward to.\n11. Hence, options \"B: food\" implies that the man will be able to eat and get out of trouble, or the man is looking forward for food. This is unlikely, so the answer is \"B: food\".\n12. Option \"C: informstion\" is also discarded. The last sentence \"in all this time\" implies that the help the man is looking for is not to fill him in on some facts or to explain something to him. \n13. \"D: recognition\" is also a misleading option as it is not relevant in determining who the man is waiting on.\n14.

The key part here is \"They have it, you don't.\" We are asked to determine the 'what' from 'it.'\nIII. Let's now analyze the options we are given\nIV. Option A: car - cars are not necessary at this location, so it's out of the way\nV. Option B: bus - we can infer the situation requires walking, so bus is also not the correct answer\nVI.

It is more common that you would hang a shirt or an underwear.\n\nG. dryer: A dryer is just a machine to do your laundry quickly.\n\nThe answer is B.\n\nAnswer: B. bathroom\n\nInput: What might be inside", "answer": "A: joy"}

Choices:  I: attic II: bookshelf III: locker IV: desk drawer V: pencil case or box VI: drawer\nRationales:\n1. The question is inquiring about the safest place to put or store a pencil.\n2. The question is asking about the correct option for putting a pencil, not whether it is possible to put it in any of the places listed in the options.\n3. Looking at the choices, we are looking to narrow down the options to the places where pencils are most likely to be safest.\n4. We know from the previous question that the words \"safest place\" is likely to refer to places where objects are unlikely to get lost or damaged.\n5. Therefore in our case, it is most likely that the choice corresponding to the safest place to hold a pencil will not necessarily be a choice where the pencil would be accessed the most or would be convenient to be reached.\n6. We can therefore eliminate options II (bookshelf), IV (desk drawer), and VI (drawer)\n7. Looking at the remaining options, one of them (V) is a container or bag that protects pencils from damage or loss.\n8. Hence, option V is the safest place for a pencil and the logical answer choice.\nAnswer: V.\n\nInput: Which of these are considered to be a'small, but important' event?

We can eliminate choices 5-6 because while graduating from college and a new school year would be events important to most people, they are not considered small.\n2. Choice 1 (\"birthday party\") would also indicate a major event because it involves celebration.\n3. Choices 2, 3, and 4 (\"purchase of a new car\" and \"a wedding\" in particular) are considered important life events; however", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

A common trait of these countries is that they are found mainly in Asia and India, and thus answer choices B and C are more accurate. The elephant is native to both Africa (choice D) and India (choice C), but only Africa is its natural habitat. The word 'continent' or 'continental,' when used alone, may be an inference of being located within a continent or continent, but that is not necessarily so, and the term can be used figuratively or as a noun.

He could do this because the driver was what? Choices: A: inattentive B: distracted C: focused D: alert E: attentive\nRationales 1. If our response is the correct answer, it must accurately answer the question. \n2. The question is asking about the action that enables the man to get on the bus. \n3. In order for the man to get on to the bus, the bus driver must be permitting him on. \n4. Hence, option A: 'inattentive' does not qualify as an answer as getting on the bus without the bus driver's consent is impossible. \n5. Option B: 'distracted' will not work because getting on the bus would require the bus to move. Getting on a moving bus is clearly feasible and a bus driver would not intentionally do it if he was distracted. \n6. Option C: 'focused' is also inappropriate as a focussed driver will not move the bus even after he is being asked to do so. \n7. Option D: 'alert' is not a relevant answer either because it would require the driver to stop the bus in a way he is not typically allowed to do. \n8.

We know that the sailor has gone from a land setting to that of sea and that he is likely facing difficulty doing that.\n3. 'Going for walk', 'getting off ship', and'staying motionless' are options that are inadequate for assisting someone to gain sea legs.\n4. 'Going for a walk' is not a consistent or reliable way for getting sea legs because it doesn't apply in an oceanic context.\n5. 'Getting off ship' does not apply to someone who is getting sea legs because this means one is no longer on the sea.\n6. Staying motionless is inapt because that's not how someone gets sea legs.\n7.

That year they decided to make a trip down into the basement.  To their surprise, they discovered the old cellar, which had been sealed closed for many years.  There, they found boxes of objects that had been forgotten for many years.  In the trunk of a box, they found a worn and faded diary written in the handwriting of a woman.  \"My name was Mary Jane Smith, but when I was married I changed the name to Johnson, thinking my new husband's name would be better.\"  The diary had been written in 1843.  Inside the diary, they found numerous handwritten articles, one dated July 1, 1884.  She wrote, \"My husband had been called away from me for a month.  But I knew he would come home, or I would die.\"  At his return home, she was delighted to see him.  They hugged and kissed.  She looked him over for any signs of the fever that was taking him away.  Her diary continued. \"I was alone with him.  I loved my husband more than I thought possible.  How could I ever let him leave again?  I found a bottle in the medicine chest.  My husband didn't know that I had this bottle.  I poured him two glasses of water, he asked for one.  He drank it without a second thought.  He had a little bit of a headache.  I watched him closely and made sure he stayed alive.  He never knew that I caused the fever.", "answer": "D: doors and windows"}

A: a pet bird B: an old-fashioned carpet C: a wild bird with no feathers D: a creature living in the Sahara desert on the edge of the river E: a bird with feathers\nRationales: From the problem statement, it is clear that this bird went extinct - so something prevented the dodo from surviving.\nFrom the available options, we can infer different things about what the dodo may have looked like.\nLooking at the options, we can see that A is 'a pet bird' and C is 'a wild bird with no feather'\nSince dodo went extinct, it is obvious that A and C are not true about it.\nD is 'a creature living in the Saharan desert on the edge of river.' \nThis option is a guess based on the statement and can be eliminated since nothing is known about the dodo from the statement.\nNow we can eliminate options A and C.\nSince it is stated that this bird went extinction, we believe that the bird was native to the specific island, so the bird had to be of some kind since they don't go native overnight.\nComing back to the options, we can further eliminate D as it makes no mention of being a bird.\nThus, options B and E are the remaining valid choices since they both refer to 'a bird'.\nFrom the options, we know that B 'an old-fashioned type of carpet' which can be eliminated since the dodo would never have been a carpet.\nIn similar logic, we can eliminate E since it mentions that the dodo had feathers and the dodo is an extinct bird.\nIt is now clear that option B is the answer.", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

Choices: B. car D. telephone F. TV H telephone I. Television J. smart watch G. computer D. telephone N cell phone\nRationales: The correct answer must be a verb + either \"text\", \"call\", or \"information\".\nB: car, D: telephone, F: TV,\nB could potentially be \"programmable\". However, the question did not specify that the device must be able to be programmed.\nHurrah, it's a phone! D could be \"programmable with an app\", and we get \"send\" and \"information\" right here. However, the question did mention that the answer must be a \"device\"...\n\nF: Television\nF is definitely not a valid choice. It probably does some programming and sending/receiving information in its own way, but it's not \"programmable\" like the question indicated.\nG: Computer\nG could definitely \"send and receive info\". However, G is a computer, not a device as required by the question.\nJ: Smart Watch\nIn reality, J could \"send and receive info\"; however, J only \"send and receive\" info about YOUR body and movement and not actual information itself.\n\"receive information\".\n(H) Telephone -\n\nD: Cell Phone\nD could be a valid choice if this were the only question.\nHowever, J and H are both examples of devices that receive/send/receive.\nHurrah! We now know devices that send and receive/information, so we know that if this were the only clue in the rest of the questions, D would have to be right.\nBut it's not the only one.\n\nI: Television\nI is not a device that send/receive information, so definitely not the right answer. However, it is a device that can be programmable...\nMystery is solved.\n\nN: Cell Phone\nN can be programmed (possibly not very well; however, it could possibly be programmed), so it's definitely a program", "answer": "B: solar energy"}

Choices A: local library B: community center C: gallery D: museum E: national park\nRationales: The question requires us to find the location or places where the artist's work can be found. All the questions options are also possible locations for the artist's work. The context of the question suggests that the work is either a painting or sculpture.\n1. We don't know if the artist's work is a painting or sculpture, we can only assume that all the choices might work as suitable locations for the artist' s work.\n2. If the work is painting then we think that A, B, C, D might work as these places can store paintings or have galleries to display artwork.\n3. If the work is a sculpture then we think that D and E might work as these places store sculptures or have museums to display artwork.\n4. The artist's work could be somewhere between A, B, C and D or E, so we can go on to determine the most suitable answer by examining the keywords used to describe the locations.\n5. All 4 of the locations, A, B, C or D or E have keywords such as library, center, gallery, museum, or park.\n6. One of the keywords here is 'center' so since 'center' is also used for 'community center' that eliminates option B.\n7. One of the keywords is 'library' so we can eliminate options A and E.\n8. One of the keywords 'park' is what the options D and E have in common.\n9. Option D:'museum' does, not specify if they are outdoor or indoor so, we can eliminate this option as some people might like to visit sculptures in outdoor parks.\n10. Option D: 'park' doesn't specify the type artwork you can view inside a museum unless it's a sculpture then option D would work.\n11. Option E: 'national park' suggests to us that it's a sculptural artwork you're looking for and there are two reasons to prove it's not a painting.\n12. Option E: 'park' also has the word", "answer": "E: utility room"}

Given the choices A,B,C and E, all of these birds belong to the same family. They are all finches. Finches are not found in Alaska.\n2. Accordingly, choice D: Finch- polar is eliminated.\n3. Out of choices A,B, and E, only choice A: Penguin-Afrika is the correct answer because penguins belong to the Finch family.

And that it might be difficult to open and that it's what we need\n2. A window has a flat and circular surface as well as a circular handle, which might be difficult to open. However, it's not what we need.\n3. Also, a fridge has a flat surface but probably more suitable.\n4. But it's not what were looking for.\n5. Therefore it means only do and fridge.\n6.

Choices:  A. enjoy yourself B. go to work C. do your best D. care for others E. take time off\nRationales: This is a question about doing what work requires. The question is asking which of the options in the question is most likely to make it easier to do what work required most days.\n1. For most days at work, it is probably best to  'do your best' or 'do what work requires'.\n2. Therefore, it is likely that doing work requires doing what you want for work or what you enjoy.\n3. So the answer is either 'B. go to work' or 'C. do your best.'\n4. But if they are both correct (C) then it is also likely that C is the most correct answer to the question.\n5. If it is B then the next most likely answers to the job are the ones that take time off (D) or care for others (E).\n6. If it is C then the next most likely answer to the job is also the one that enjoys themselves (A).\n\nAnswer: D and E\n\n### Bonus Point\nInput: Are you ready for an exam?

Often, decisions on them depend on what people think.\n    This logical fallacy is often used in advertising to encourage people to buy things that they may not otherwise do.\n    For example, when you buy a lottery ticket you are being told that you may win a big prize, but that you may not.\n    In this way, people can be persuaded to buy things that they do not need.", "answer": "E: bus stop"}

Choices: A: they look B: they act C: they feel D: they see E: they live F: they believe**\n\nRationales: Let's start by reading the part \"in what ways\". Here we see the keyword \"many people\". In this context, this tells us that the question is asking about how \"many people\" do things.\nSo, this leaves us with only these options: \"they act\", \"they feel\", \"they live\", and \"they believe\".\nSo these are the answers \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", and \"A\".\nNext, let's consider what the question really asks. This is the question portion we're addressing;\n\"of many people who think differently\"\nThis tells us that the option choices are referring to a number of people.\nNow let's analyze each option to see which better fits this context:\n\"A: they look\" is a sentence fragment, so we can cross this off. \"B: they act\" also does not fit well here.\n\"C: they feel\" is referring to an emotional or mental condition (\"feel\" in this case refers to sensory perception as it is an emotion or feeling, not an action), and we can rule this out.\nComing to \"D: they live\", this choice best describes how humans live. This tells us that this is the answer.\n\"E: they believe\"", "answer": "E: school"}

What can you do with a house? Choices:  R:  sleep C: get warm I: cook D: earn money E: make beds\nRationales: We are given that \"there are some important things to remember while building a house\", from which we can understand the house is being built and we are given a choice of what we can do with the house.\nFrom this we can also infer that after the house is built, these things do not matter much.\nThere are 5 options given.\n1. Earn money: This is something people might do after the house is built. There is no mention of \"Earn money\" in the instructions. We can therefore rule out E: make beds.\n2. Cook: We can also rule out D: earn money because people wouldn't earn money by cooking. So, D is ruled out. This leaves us with E: make beds or R: sleep or C: get warm.\nA possible scenario to justify C: get warm is after a long night at work, one needs to warm themselves in their home. So this could be the first use of this house after being built.\nWe could also rule out C: get warm because most houses also include a kitchen. One would cook, then sleep and then get warm. There is no mention that the house is specifically built to get warm. So, C: get warm seems reasonable.\nWhen we come to D: earn money or E: make beds, both of these seem to imply that the house is built, it has been constructed but something has gone wrong and now it needs to be made better (fixing broken things). We understand that the house has been built so we cannot say that the house is built and also bears D or E. This is a contradiction and we can therefore rule out D: earning money and E: make beds from this logic.\nNow we are left with C: get warm as the best answer.\nAnswer: E", "answer": "B: sea world"}

The question specifies use of ketchup, thereby leading us to conclusion that cat used ketchup, since cats, not fish, will do something. The question contains a modifier. The modifier states that the ketchup was being applied to the _________ of the fish. Thus, 1) We know that fish does not have a face, that is cat used ketchup to which part of the fish? 2) We can eliminate answer choices C and E since cat can't use ketchup on head and nose of the fish. 3) Answer A and B is excluded since both answers talk about what cat used ketchup for, the cat's head.", "answer": "C: small group"}

Therefore, the answer to this question is E: tree\nAnswer: E: tree\n\nInput: If the dog was on the porch, where was the person? Choices: \tA: apartment B: mansion C: house D: shed E: room\nRationales: The question is asking where would the person be given the fact that the dog is on the porch.\n1. We know from the context that a porch is some kind of structure outside of the house.\n2. Considering the various options,'shed' is a place where a person might not have lived, it doesn't help us narrow our choices.\n3. 'Mansion' is a big house, but again has nothing to do with where someone would be, so'mansion' is out.\n4. 'Apartment' typically refers to a dwelling for multiple people. So this option is also out.\n5. 'House': We know that the dog could be found on a porch, so the person could not be very far away. The person would likely be somewhere close to the house, such as in the house, or a house room or annex.\n6. Therefore 'house' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: H: house\n\nInput: Where was the person most likely to be, given the fact that the girl was in the city?

The question tells us that the girl was in a 'city'. Since we know her to be in a city, this means that an option that refers to the city will be most suitable for a proper answer.\n2. Therefore, we can rule out 'park', 'grocery store','museum', and 'town'. These aren't cities, they are places where a city-dwelling person would spend time.\n3. Hence, 'library' would be the most suitable.\n4. This is because it's not likely that the girl would prefer to stay in a library for the rest of her life. So she must be visiting.\n5.

Those seeking the pleasure of a warm foot rub B. Those who prefer to keep their feet in a foot tray C. Those who have access to a foot spa D. Those with clean cuticles E. Those who have never received a pedicure\nRationales: The problem statement is asking for a good candidate for a pedicle. A 'pedicure' is a cosmetic procedure for the feet, such as grooming toenails, cleaning soles, etc.\n1. Analyzing the list of answers, options A and C do not mention anything about anyone receiving a pedicle. Option A talks about the experience of \"pleasure\" of a foot rub, hence eliminating it as an option. Option C talks about those that have access to foot spas. Therefore, foot spa is not a required characteristic for those that seek out a pedicle.\n2. Options D and E don't offer a good description for someone who seeks out pedicle. The answer for this question is answer D: \"Those with clean cuticles\". This is because clean pedicles indicates a healthy and well-groomed foot. Pedicle helps improve circulation which allows cuticle to develop in healthy manner. A pedicure is also likely to be performed on people who wear footwear such as shoes because the pedicle gives an indication of one's cleanliness. In addition people with clean cuticles are also likely to seek relief from their foot pain for it improves their experience and makes the pedicle more likely to be sought due to the comfort provided by it.

This word choice makes sense in many ways. \nFirstly, the correct wording, as given in the question, is \u201cTo keep your balance, you must remain on\u2026\u201d. This means that only the wheel is being referred to, as you cannot remain on the bicycle, road, or edge, as they are other things. \n\u201c\u2026you have to remain on\u2026\u201d also makes it clear that only the single wheel can be the answer, as you do not have to keep your balance on anything else beside the wheel. \nFinally, since it is not given that the wheel is a bicycle wheel, it could be any wheel of any vehicle, including an ice-skate blade.\nFurther, it could be a crank, a lever, or even a rotating shaft on a vehicle.", "answer": "C: jar"}

Choices:  J: different  C: another place B: something  A: a job  E: a boss  L: many  F: one friend R: not married  G: my old house\nRationales: The problems are asking us to infer patterns, rules, or relationships among variables based on the data and context. Here is a summary:\n1. Both the boys are from the north, but he had a job that was in the south.\n2. Both the boys were in high school, but he had a boss, while I had a friend.\n3.

What did she use instead? Choices: \nA: A piece of wood B: An apple C: Fruit juice D: A leaf E: Pottery\nRationales:\n1. In order to understand this question, it's important that we understand the sentence context. The question focuses on the witch's choice of a magical item to use in the trick, which suggests that the witch's trick is performed through some magic.\n2. In this context, the witch obviously doesn't choose to use a physical apple, this would not be magical.\n3. So, what does she use? If we go by the sentence context, she chooses to use a plant. \n4. A leaf or fruit juice can't be considered a plant.\n5. This leaves us with only 3 options\u2014a piece of wood, an apple, and pottery. \n6. An apple is a fruit, and we already know that fruit juice cannot be used for the trick because it's not a plant. \n7. Similarly, a piece of wood cannot be used either as it's not magical material.\n8. So, it's left to pottery. The witch uses pottery as the answer to the question because it's the only non-magical plant-related item that she can use to cast the spell and perform the magic. \n9.

Choices: A: jump high B: play tennis C: ride fast D: jump E: play fast\nRationales: Firstly, let\u2019s try to understand the context better by understanding the tone of the conversation based on how you are supposed to answer.  We do not get a clear tone with this question, but we can infer some things.\ni. Based on the language of the question, they speak more about your dad rather than about yourself.\nii. The conversation suggests a tone or feeling of curiosity and also of a little boasting, as if the other person did not see what the other person\u2019s dad could do, and wants to know what he can do.\niii. It seems to be more about what you have seen your dad do as opposed to you saying that you have done something that nobody else has done or seen.\niv. The tone also suggests that the other person did not even give you that much importance to answer directly about yourself as opposed to your dad.\nv. The implication is that the person is asking your dad because he may have done many things and is curious.\nvi. Considering this, let us now examine the choices available to us.\nvii. Choice \u2018play fast\u2019 is not clear enough as to what it is getting at.  It could mean many things, like playing a very high score in a game, a very high speed, or something like that.\nviii.

Choices: A: a park B: a home C: a stadium D: a ground E: a palace\nRationales: There is an error in the multiple choice question that is likely to triuph any student. To identify this source of error, we have to carefully evaluate every clue used in the question first.\nThe question starts on a rather simple note by stating that the 2017 Championship Series was played at the WRIGLEY FIELD. This is one of the most common mistakes that students make by not reading the instructions of a question carefully. \nThe next line says that it is  a park. This is where the students tend to read it in too many details without knowing what is the question. The first line was clear enough to understand if there are so many players in the game, which is an example to give a hint that the question is related to baseball. The 2nd line that is confusing but not clear on its own.  This leads to students trying to read the options for the answer instead of reading how it was answered in the 1st line. \nThe next clue is the 3rd line that says \"the championship was played in a large stadium named for their landlord's name\" \nHerein lies the core of the trick. The question's author's goal is to make the students focus on the options and answer as they read them in the hope that they will try to make the answer fit with the options.\nThe 4th line then says, \"the answer is STADIUM\".

Choices:  Q: recovering A: dull B: lazy C: sad D: weak E: negative\nRationales: The doctor states that the patient's state is recovering. We need to identify what the patient used to be once a month.\n1. The patient's state is \"recovering\".\n2. Recovering can have two meanings -- the first is to improve. Or the second is to regain something lost after illness.\n3. When we relate to the question, we see that 'weak' and 'negative' are the most apt choices.\n4. Weakness means ill health or an area that needs improvement. So this answer is 'weak'.\n5. Another word similar to weak is 'negative'. But there are only two options and both of them are used in the phrase 'negative state'. So, we can't rule out 'negative'.\n6. As we see, both the words are interchangeable in this context. So, either 'weak' or 'negative' fits to this question.\n7. If we compare the answer choices, some words are redundant or don't have enough context to solve them.\n8. However, as per the context,'recovering' is not the word at its best so 'weak' can be ruled out.\n9. 'Dull' and 'lazy' are common slang terms that mean lack of interest. So as we see, these options are not suitable.\n10. 'Sad' and 'negative' both are feelings related to negative emotions. So, these are also not apt.\n11. From the remaining set of 2 words, we have another dilemma.\n12. We have two words and two different meanings. One is recovering and the other is'stronger'.\n13. 'Recovering' in this context is not referring to'stronger'.\n\nThus, to find the right answer, let's analyze the context.

Choices:  A. non hazardous B. very difficult C. highly damaging D. dangerous E. dangerous and highly damaging\nRationales: The doctor's statement is likely describing a dangerous treatment that also has detrimental effects on the patient (hence, \"damaging\").\n1. The choices can be assessed in the following manner:\n2. \"non hazardous\" - This is not the correct answer because any treatment can have dangerous side effects, and so none would be \"non hazardos\". However, the answer does not specify that a dangerous treatment is mentioned, and so this option is incorrect\n3. \"very difficult\" - The doctor's statement can be interpreted in different ways. \"very difficult\" in context may refer to very difficult for the patient to understand or accept that the treatment is dangerous.\n4. \"highly damaging\" - This is more ambiguous than \"dangerous\", but it still would not be appropriate because it would not describe a potential danger to the patient.\n5. \"dangerous\" - This term may be applied to a treatment that has damaging side effects for the patient, but it does not specify the same way in which \"dangerous\" can be dangerous or damaging. Since the question is not asking for a \"very dangerous\" treatment, this term is not appropriate.\n6. \"dangerous and highly damaging\" - Another way of stating \"dangerous\" is simply \"dangerous\". This term is not necessarily describing a dangerous and damaging treatment, however, and so this option would not be appropriate.\n7.

This may change in a day or two, but for now, they don't know for certain if the teachers are happy with their performance.\n\nRationales: Question 1.2: The first part, 'Do you do the same thing every day?' is an incomplete or missing sentence that needs the word 'all'.

You can also lose track of what?  Choices:  A.  your location B.  your money C.  your progress D.  your thoughts E.  your phone\nRationales: Input: 1. The first statement highlights the possibility of becoming disoriented in a maze.\n2. Secondly, it offers an insight into the concept of losing track of something.\n3. This would lead to confusion or misdirection when the thing (in this case, your thoughts) are inaccessible.\n4. This confusion may lead to you struggling to find what you have lost or become lost yourself in the maze in the process of misplacing or losing your thoughts.\n5. Thus the problem is about the loss of something. The question asks for which something?\n6. Given this, we can eliminate the answers B., and D., which don't indicate how the thing or things are lost.\n7. We can also rule out E. (your phone) for the same reasons. Even though you may lose your phone, you aren't losing it directly.\n8. However, the answers A., and C. suggest misplacement or misdirection in what is lost and which causes you to get lost, thus C. is the correct answer.\nAnswer: C. your progress\n\n---\n\n### Instructions\n\nInput: Which answer best shows the given phrase in the given sentence?\n\n---\n\nInput: In which of the following options can you find the underlined part in  the sentences below?

Looking at choices [A], [B], and [C], choices [A] and [C] both contain A: or a colon.\n\n2.

The features could be different designs, sizes, models, styles, and colors\n3. Features in this case need to be identified that allow this new product to be unique and/or offer different variants.\n4. Among the choices given, it's important that all these are features but they also need to have variants.\n5. Features have variants (A: designs, sizes, models and styles) but colors do not typically have variants.\n6. Models and styles are variants and would work as a feature and colors would work as features that a product could come in since they are variants.\n7.

Each of these constellations are given the name of one or more of the brightest stars within them, each constellation will have at most 120 different named stars within it. Given that there are 117 recognised constellations of stars (7 constellations of the 87 constellations have yet been discovered), we know that the most stars in a constellation cannot exceed 116.

Choices:  A. toy B. truck C. bicycle D. umbrella E. backpack\nRationales: Based on the question, we can tell that the \"young child\" will probably be found holding onto something, but it is unclear what this something will be.\n1. The options include a \"toy\", a \"truck\", a \"bicycle\", an \"umbrella\", and a \"backpack\".\n2. Each of these options has something to do with objects that are used by children. \n3. We can rule out \"bicycle\" because it is not usually for sale in a garage, and because the child, instead of holding the bicycle, may be riding it.\n4. The child may also be riding a \"truck\" or holding an \"umbrella\". Since \"trucks\" are not typically found in garages, we can rule them out as an option.\n\n5. That leaves \"toys\", \"umbrellas\", and \"backpacks\" as possible answers.\n6. Of these three, the best choice is \"umbrella\" because it is something you can actually hold onto.\n7. Therefore option E is the best answer.\n\nAnswer: E. backpack\n\nInput: What would a lion be likely doing most often?

Based on the question, it would not be \"resting\" because, \"lions generally have no problem just resting as they may need to do so at some level throughout the day.\"\n2. The answer then is either \"running\" or \"eating.\"\n3. Both of the options refer to physical activities, so \"running\" is a better choice.\n4.

A: watch television 3. A: play video games 4. A: play in snow 5. A: play with toys\nRationales: The problem statement refers to two objects. For each of these objects, we need to identify what a child would do with them.\n\nFor the first object (15 quarks and three antibaryons), the question lists five options, each consisting of actions children engage in. However, quarks and antibaryons are in essence subatomic particles or particles that are much smaller than atoms.\n\nConsidering this information, we can rule out all five options with regard to the first object, which is a much smaller object and does not make much sense for them to be engaged in many of the activities listed.\n\nFrom there, the statement can now refer to the entire phrase (15 quarks + 3 antibarytons), so we can focus our attention on the second object.\nThe second object can be identified as the phrase: 5 grams of carbon and 20 atoms of hydrogen. However, it is also a unit of mass.\n\nIn this case, we can rule out the five options again (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) as they are all associated with specific activities that children engage in, rather than with mass.\nHence, answer choice D is the correct answer here. \nAnswer: D: play with toys.\n\nInput: What happened to your money after you left the bar?

Choices:  B : axe C: toolbox D: saw E: shears\nRationales: In the statement of the problem, it's said that we need a tool to cut metals. However, we should buy one based on how it behaves. This indicates that we need to determine what a tool that cuts metal is called.\nLooking at the options provided, we can see that B: axe, C: toolbox, D: saw, and E: shears can all cut metal. However, they are not tools that are used to cut metal.\nHence, we can't infer what a 'tool to cut metal' actually refers to. Therefore, the choices provided are not relevant to the question.\nWe can infer that B: axe and C: toolbox relate to tools used to cut, while E: shears are used as an instrument to cut metal. So, the correct answer is A: Tool\nAnswer: A: Tool\n\nInput: A bird's nest can be found in a tree, which is a what? Choices: A: location B: part C: body D: part E: object\nRationales: The context of the question points towards finding a bird's nest in a tree. It's more specific, implying that it's found somewhere in the tree, and not just anywhere. Since the options given represent different categories of the tree, these are also more distinct places where a bird's nest might be found.\nThe options 'location' and 'part' don't pertain to a tree in any way. These choices do not offer specific references to the tree or a specific place that a nest could hide in.\nSimilarly, the options 'body' and 'object' don't convey to what part of it specifically a bird's nest is found in. A tree's body and its object could be anywhere or could signify just anything.\nThis leaves us only with 'part'. It's the only option that conveys a specific region or part of something which is used to express a place or location where a bird's Nest can be found in", "answer": "A: desire"}

Choices:  B: it will be eaten  C: it will die  D: it will be saved  E: it will swim away  Rationales: 1: The question asks what will happen then (in this case, once the seagull is eaten). 2: The first options provided are what would happen to the seagull immediately after being eaten by the shark (options B & C). The next two options (D & E) are then hypothetical outcomes, based on the seagull being \"saved\" or \"swimming away\" respectively. 3: If the shark is eaten, what is most likely to occur is that the shark will die. 4: If the seagull is saved, either it will live to swim away or it will drown. 5: The seagull, based on its description, cannot \"swim away\". It is most likely that it will be eaten. 6: The seagull will die if it is eaten or saved. 7: Therefore the most likely outcome is that the seagull will be eaten.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: Marmots have the best memory, they have how many fingers to be able to remember things with?

'Tree' is, thus, the most fitting answer in terms of the given options that also fit the contextual details.\nAnswer: D (tree)\n\nInput: One way to avoid being eaten by a crocodile is to not swim in murky waters.  What happens to crocodiles when they swim in murky water? Choices:  C: they drown A: they get infected E: their ears fall out D: they go deaf\nRationales: This question asks to describe the outcome of swimming in murky water when there are crocodiles present. There is no context in the question to imply that they are specifically crocodiles with degraded vision or another disability. Instead, they can be any type of crocodile.  To answer this, we first need to define what murky water means. We can define it as any water that is not clear, especially because of the presence of a lot of substances like sediments or organic matter that prevent light from passing through. A murky water does not necessarily contain more or less salinity or minerals than clearer water. So from this, we can infer that although murky water may prevent the animal from seeing certain objects, it does not necessarily directly hurt them. This means that we can eliminate options A, E, D, and C. However, option B: they swim to other places, does not match with the problem statement as it simply states that they swim to murky places where they can more easily see prey, and does not explicitly indicate that they stop or otherwise affect themselves. This eliminates option B. Therefore, the answer to this question is option D: they go deft.\nAnswer: D. They Go Daft\n\nInput: After the water level rose, which tree was no longer being invaded by sharks? Choices:  D: a dead tree. A: every tree C: a live tree. B: a pine E: a plum tree\nRationales The problem statement implies that the water level has risen (higher than previous levels). Higher water level implies that the volume of water in the water body had increased. Therefore, the question implies that previously sharks had invaded the said tree and then they no longer did so once the water level rose and there was no longer enough of or in the water body to sustain sharks.

Choices:  L: gills B: brain C: jaw E: skin\nRationales: The question asks \"what kind of body part\". So, we need to determine which body part was near the lure when it got swallowed by the fish.\nLooking at the choices, we have L: gills, B: brain, C: jaw, and E: skin.\nSince 'gills' and'skin' are located at the same place relative to the lure, so we can eliminate both of them. 'L: gills' is incorrect because the question says 'close to', where 'gills' are located a lot further away as they are located at the fish's head.\nSo, now we are left with only two options - 'brain' or 'jaw'. But 'L: brain' is incorrect as 'brains' are not located close to the lure. Therefore, only 'jaw' can be correct answer.\nHence, C:jaw\nAnswer: C: jaw\n\nInput: When we have the correct sequence, it is what?

This means that all options are choices of significance, but some carry more importance than others. \n6. We know the pebbles are important based on the context that these are the stones on the path to the person's house. \n7. The key phrase is, these pebbles \"could be the cause of pain\" or the \"source of pain\". \n8. So, these pebbles play one of the significant roles- either they are the cause of pain or the source of pain.\n9. Answer depends on which role the pebbles play.\n10. The only remaining options are pebbles that could be the cause of pain or are the source of pain. \n11. Answer will be either 'D: cause of pain' or 'E: source of pain'.\n12.

It's important to read the question and statements carefully to get the exact meaning.\n3. In this case, \"mountains\" was left out of the sentence.\n4. The word \"mountainous\" indicates that we are dealing with more than one mountain.\n5. Mountains often have many slopes and are not usually isolated as single entities.\n6.

What is it using for this purpose? Choices:  a: ink b: pigment c: scales d: shadow e: muscles\nRationales: The key to this question is determining what the chameleon is using for color change.\n1. According to the question, the chameleon has \"the ability to change color\". By definition, we can infer that it is using some substance for this reason.\n2. Therefore, we need to first rule out the choices that refer to \"what\" or \"which\". The words \"ink\", \"pigment\", and \"Muscles\" all refer to an object, which does not align with the requirement. So, it is not an object that the animal is using for color change but rather a characteristic that it possesses.\n3. After excluding objects, we can go ahead and rule out choices that refer to a \"scales\". \"Scales\" is plural, so it should refer to several scales. However, in the context of chameleons, they only have a few scales on their bodies that change colors.\n4. As for \"shadow,\" it makes no sense to use a shadow for the chameleon to change color. Also, a shadow is a form of absence from the light which is the opposite of being present (light) with color.\n5. Hence, it remains for the other choices. But, from the available information on what the chameleons do, we can deduce that the ability to change colors is not governed by their muscles, ink, or pigment.\n\n6. Hence, we can exclude them as well. So the word choice for the question would be A: Muscles as a single muscle can change color.\n7. Answer: A : Muscles\n7. Answer: B: Muscles or C: Muscles\nAnswer: A: Muscles\n\nInput: The shrew is able to burrow into dirt.  How does it do this?

Choices: 1. Traditional 2. A small room with a student-teacher relationship between the student and teacher 3. One where each person has a specific seat 4. One where everyone can see the professor 5. One where each student has their own microphone 6. One where there are multiple classrooms with the same content\nRationales:\n1. When there is a large collection of students at a single university, a large class is more likely to be the norm. Generally, this would mean a class that is made up of a large room with all the students sitting in it.\n2. This could be in some lecture and discussion halls, but typically would take a somewhat more traditional structure that features rows of chairs, desks, or tables for each student.\n3. We can further rule out the possibility that the students at this large university use a classroom structure in which there are no seats at all, as it would be practically impossible to accommodate the sheer number of students.\n4. We also do not see any potential option that would require students to be seated while having their own microphone, so we can rule out the concept of microphones altogether as something that applies to this classroom structure.\n5. Since there are a large number of students in a relatively small area (not a 'large' area, as it's still relatively small compared with the amount of students there), the chances of a class that allows each student to see the professor are very slim.\n6. If this class size was large enough that it could have multiple classrooms with the exact same information, the information in these classrooms would likely not have to be in front of each student individually, but would instead be displayed via a screen so that all of the students can see it.\n7. Therefore option A: \"a traditional classroom\" is the most appropriate answer, as this is the typical structure of a large classroom and fits with the description of the question.\nInput: What is the likely place where your teacher will ask or tell you?

The place the animals are in search of food is the most critical factor that needs to be answered.\n2. From the given answers, the ones that are irrelevant are B: garden, C: grass field, D: bush, and E: tree as all these can be found around deserts.\n3. The remaining choices are then B: oasis and A: waterhole. To get to oasis, these animals would need to travel far from the grass field, and waterhole. This indicates that these animals need water or should have access to water. And the only choice where one is guaranteed to have water is A: waterhole.\n4. Since these animals are searching for food/water, option A: waterhole is the most relevant answer and therefore, it answers the question completely.\nAnswer: A; waterhole\n\nInput: Where is the best place for a cat to be taken after a medical checkup? Choices:  C: backyard D: house E: garden F: street\nRationales: The context of the passage indicates that the cat in question had just been brought to a veterinarian for a medical checkup and the owner/person bringing the cat needs to take the cat home.\n6. In the cat's home, one would typically find a yard/garden, inside the house, or inside the house in the living room where it is likely safe from any traffic or loud noises.\n7. There are several good locations which could result in the best place where the cat should be taken after the medical checkup.\n8. The following options can be eliminated:\n9. Eliminating 'B: house' and 'F: street' because they are too general and nonconclusive regarding the cat's safety and ability to get good care after the medical checkup at home.\n10. Looking at the options, 'D, house' contains the word 'outside' or 'out' which hints that it should involve the environment", "answer": "C: calm"}

Choices:  \"A: eat B: leave C: finish D: serve E: make\nRationales: To begin with, this question is asking about what the chef did at the end of a meal preparation process.\n\nConsidering the choices, it's likely that \"finish\", \"serve\", \"eat\", \"leave\", and \"make\" all indicate actions associated with various stages in the cooking process.\n\nWe can easily eliminate the first two options because eating and leaving are actions associated with the dishes, and not with the chef.\n\nIn the remaining three, \"serving\" means presenting the completed dish or food item for the customer to begin the eating or consumption process. This does not provide an overview of the chef's action at the end. It's not a proper response for the given question.\n\nOption \"finish\" is a more vague term that could be loosely associated with the chef's actions anywhere between the beginning and the end of the preparation process. Therefore, it's not a good answer in the given context.\n\nFinally, option \"make\" might indicate that the chef did some form of additional preparation after the meal was ready. However, we don't know when the chef acted, and it could have been prior or later than the end of the preparations. Therefore, this too is not a valid response to the question.\n\nThe only remaining response that fits the given prompt is Option C: \"finish,\" which implies that the chef completed the assigned task at the end and was ready to begin new tasks, or else leave or eat if the chef was done cooking altogether.\n\nAnswer: C: finish\n\nInput: What is the meaning of the phrase, a person can't do what a person can't?

{"text": "characteristic. Therefore, the answer must be E: tree.\nAnswer: E tree\n\nInput: Where may a shark prefer to rest during the day? Choices: \tA: outside B: underwater C: jungle \tD: tree E: desert\nRationales:\t1. The question requires providing the place where a shark might rest during the day. Sharks must be found in water during most of their lifecycle.\n2. Most species of sharks have to stay in water since they rely on the water to power their movements with their tails.\n3. Therefore, it is impossible to find sharks outside or on the land.\n4. In the context of resting from the day's effort in hunting, a shark would prefer to rest in water.\n5. In fact, if you research where most sharks rest during the day, you would find that many of them are active during the night.\n6. This means they need to avoid having prey find and catch them during the day. \n7. Therefore, we must select 'underwater' as the right answer as it is the only choice option that could logically suggest the shark rest during the day. Other options (jungle, tree, desert) don't make sense regarding sharks' lifestyles or lifecycles.\nAnswer: B underwater\n\nInput: Who would be best suited for an adventure, a snake or a mongoose? Choices:  B: mongoose C: python D: copperhead E: anaconda\nRationales:1. The problem statement refers to two animals: snakes and mongooses. The question is asking us to name the one better suited for an adventurous trip. We will need to analyze the available choices.\n2. Considering the context, the word 'best' implies'most appropriate', meaning the answer should be the animal that is most suitable for the task based on the available choices.\n3. Among the given animals, snakes typically move sluggishly in their habitat and their speed differs depending on the species.\n4. Therefore, they are generally seen as ill-suited for adventurous trips, especially expeditions requiring a great deal of energy or fast movement.\n5. On this account, the snake is the least suitable for the adventure.\n6. Mongooses,", "answer": "A: prison"}

Choices:  A. they had too many things to do B. they couldn't commit C. they would get distracted D. they would feel good\nRationales: From the options given in the paragraph above, it can be inferred that the sentence was referring to many options.\nNow, when something is overwhelming, it usually means that it is too much to bear.\nThe question asks about the result a person may have due to too many options. For this, there are two choices given: A. they had too may things to do, and B. they would get distraced.\nThe given options can be placed into categories as follows: \nA. They had too many things to choose from\nB. They would get distracted by the options\nC. They would commit, but may feel good\nD. They would feel overwhelmed too\nThe given options are: A. they had to many things to do(distract them from making a choice)\nB. they would get distacted from the options (but this can be due any number of options. Even one or two options may be overwhelming)\nC. they would commit to a final choice, but may feel good about how difficult the task was due to all the options. (however, they would not feel overwhelmed by the options and would make a choice with conviction)\nD. they would feel overwhelming by all the options, but not due to them being too many options, but instead due to the task itself and the pressure to make a choice\nAnother option that could be the answer to the question is \"They would get distracted from the options and would still not be able to make a final choice.\"\nThis could easily have happened because a person is distracted by options and therefore is unable to make a choice, even though there are many options available.\nIt is also possible that the person's incessant indecision and hesitation may result into them getting overwhelmed by their inability to choose an option.\nEven if there are many options, ultimately the person", "answer": "C: solitude"}

Choices:  _\nRationales: The pendulum is a mechanism to hang weights from a string or wire.\n1. A pendulum is not a location in the physical sense or where we may locate objects. The answer would reflect the context of the pendulum and not necessarily the location of objects or physical places near it.\n2. So, if we refer to the question as written, it doesn't seem consistent because pendulums are usually used in the context of science experiments like in a lab.\n3. There may also be a possibility that a \"pendulum\" may refer to some kind of location like a place a pendulum is located.\n4. However this possibility seems unlikely because pendulums may also function similarly as weights on a wire when suspended on the wire.\n5. So, the term pendulum could refer to the motion or its function rather than its location.\n6.

The expression has 23 units, but the statement is about a dwelling that can hold beds.\n3. Consideration of option B: a 16-square-meter dwelling suggests that multiple beds can fit within the dwelling, but the expression uses the number of beds, not the room.\n4. Therefore it is possible to use option C: a one-hundred meter radius.\n5. The radius is a common unit of measurement and is the distance from a center point to its outermost boundary which is a circle's perimeter.\n6. This statement can be mapped to the expression we have.\n7. For example, a 5-bedroom dwelling that was ten meters in radius would take up exactly 23 units.\n8.

Choices: A: eat during the day B: smoke in the streets C: play in the park D: speak out of turn E: pray in public\nRationales:1. The general context of the question centers on countries, laws, and prohibited activities.\n2. The word \"illegal\" is defined as \"forbidden by law or failure to follow the law.\"\n3. We must examine the context of the question to determine how the activity mentioned (which can be either \"eating\", \"smoking\", \"playing in the park\", \"speaking out of turn\", \"praying in public\") is illegal.\n4. This may be done by using the fact that all of the options begin with the prefix -\"in most countries\"- to narrow down the options to those countries where the activity is illegal. \n5. However, even if one of the options is found to make sense in all the countries mentioned, the correct response should still be identified by applying what the word \"legal\" means: \"permit or sanction by official or recognized authority.\" \n6. Thus, the activity in question is permitted, or sanctioned, within the law and it is only illegal within countries in which the word \"illegal\" in the question is used.\n7. Out of the choices given, option A: \"eating during the day\" can be eaten all over the world including in countries, cities, etc where it is illegal to speak out of turn or pray in public or speak in public at all for that matter.

The question mentions the time period of 'last time' the bear was seen, which is in the future time frame of today's date.\n2. The time '11:59AM' refers back to some date in the future. But since future dates are not fixed, all dates are equally valid options to choose from. \n3. Hence, all the six dates in '11:55AM' to '11:58AM' are feasible choices because none exceed the future time mentioned in the question.\n4. All six of these dates start with '11:5' and end with '59AM', so we need to analyze their individual connotations to choose one.\n5. 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday' and 'Sunday' are the only options that start with '11', and none of the other options are preceded by a 'Wednesday'.\n6. Since '11AM' is 12 hours after midnight, we discard 'A: Thursday', 'E: Monday' from the answer options as both those days do not have hours of operation at 11 in the morning.\n7. This is because most businesses and organizations operate from morning (i.e. before 12 noon) to late afternoon or after 5 PM (i.e. beyond 5:30 or 5:45).\n8. Thus, the answer is B: Friday because it's 12 hours before the next Thursday and the other days have already passed.\nAnswer: B Friday\n\nInput: The best places to get information on the subject matter are _______.

Choices:  a: never, only if it's not real and the temperature is below zero degrees celsius, because it can be hard to differentiate between faux and real fur if it's not below zero c: always, because it is a more affordable and humane alternative to real fur d: only if the temperature is below zero, because it would be less humane to wear fake fur in warm conditions\nRationales: a and c are incorrect because, although people should never wear fur, they should never ever wear fake (or faux) fur because it mimics real fur in its appearance, texture, and feels.\nb and d are incorrect because nobody should wear fake fur at -100\u2103 and -1000\u2103, respectively, as the human body, at this temperature, could not regulate heat and is at risk of hypothermia and frostbite.\nAs a compromise, option d is chosen as being humane because it mimics the physical properties of real fur.\nAnswer: d: only if the temparature is below zero, because fake fur, if it is to be used at all, should be reserved for times that can be done more humane conditions.\n\nInput: Can you give a 5 minute speech in only 3 minutes? Choices: 1. Yes it is still a 5 minute speech, only now you can start using longer sentences, 2. That is still 5 minutes since 30 seconds is still a little under 2 minutes, 3. Of course! Since the speech is only 5 minutes long already, there is no difference, 4. Sorry, that's not how speeches work. You can't start giving a 5 minute speech 3 minutes into it, it doesn't even make sense.\nRationales: In option 1, the 5 minute speech is still valid, even though you can now use longer sentences. You can only do this if you are speaking faster, which only equates to 3 minutes.\nIn options 2, 3, and 4, you are not actually changing the time of the speech and if you are saying more, now you are only talking for five minutes or so,", "answer": "C: outside"}

Choices: A: high in the sky B: in a tree C: in a nest D: on a high branch E: on the ground\nRationales: This question asks us to identify the logical destination for an owl. There are eight distinct options to choose from:\n\n1. High in the sky, which has no logical answer, is irrelevant to the owl problem.\n\n2. Nest doesn't make sense, as an owl only nests when it has babies.\n\n3. A tree and its branches would be a good potential sleeping destination. Owls typically nest in trees.\n\n4. A high branch makes sense since it would provide a better view while also making the owl harder to hit.\n\n5. The ground would present the biggest risk. Even if an owl finds a soft spot, it would probably be eaten by predators while trying to find a shelter.\n\n6. The most logical place for an Owl to sleep is high in a tree on some sort of branch. The owl uses the night sky to locate prey. Therefore, they would prefer to be in an area that has a clear view of both the night sky and prey.\n\nAnswer: D: on a high Branch\n\nInput: Which of the following foods would you keep in a refrigerator?

{"text": "characteristics.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is 'tree'.\nAnswer: C: jungle\n\nInput: A lot of different people can be found in a jail, why is that? Choices:  C: They committed a crime. D: They are guilty E: They are innocent\nRationales: This question contains two premises: 'a lot of different people can found in a jail' and that 'a lot of different types of people can be found in jail because they got there for a reason'. The question is, what is the reason for their presence in jail and what do the answers imply about this reason? Looking at the choices, it's clear that the first premise is true because a 'lot of different people are found in jail'. But if people are found in a jail because they 'got there for a reason', this would imply that people should not just be thrown in jail regardless of why they're there. As such, it is not the only factor that explains why people are found in jails.  This implies that some people are found in jills because they have been convicted of a crime or have been found guilty. In other words, the second premise can be inferred from the options given. A lot of different people are found at an airport because they have got travel documents. A lot of different types of clothing are sold because there is a market for them. A lot of different things can be found on a bookshelf because books need them. Likewise, in a jail lot of different people can't be found by the fact that they have to be there (for a reason), and lot of different types of clothes can't be found in a warehouse. This leaves us with choices 'C: They committed a crime' and 'D: They are guilty.' But why 'guilty' rather than 'just accused'? Because people accused of a crime (or believed to commit a crime) can have innocent appearances and behaviors (and vice-versa). And to the extent that they can, they should be given a chance to prove their innocence. If one is truly guilty, chances are they will not be able to prove their innocence unless they did nothing or were misjudged. A person committing a crime is always guilty, as the crime itself requires committing the act and having the desired effect (causing harm). However,", "answer": "B: polished"}

So the most likely place a Marmot can be found is a 'Rocky Hillside'.\nAnswer: A: Rocky Hillside\n\nInput: A good place for ice-climbing is at high altitude. Choices A: Rocky hillsides B: Mountains C: Glaciers D: Sea cliffs E: Snowy terrain\nRationales: The problem statement implies that ice-climbing can only be done well at high altitude.\n1. Hence, 'cold, rough terrain' does not meet the context.\n2. If the location is not high enough to host an ice-climber, the environment would not be ideal for this sport and would be considered too cold, rough terrain.\n3. Options B, C, and D are not good answers as none of them could be high enough. They are all either mountains, glaciers, or cliffs that are at sea level as indicated by the context.\n4. Option A: 'Rocky hillsides' may be a place for ice-climping provided that its elevation is sufficient. Hence, it is the answer.\nAnswer: A, Rocky hillsides\n\nInput: The lion ate the pigeon in a way that caused him pain. So, the lion was probably what? Choices: A: overweight B: malnourished C: fit D: unhealthy E: weak\nRationales: Here the question implies that the lion ate the bird in such a way that it must have caused him pain.\nIf the lion is overweight, he is more likely to be healthy than weak.  So, option A: overweight cannot be the answer.\n\nSince the word'malnourished' refers to someone who is undernourished, it also describes some people who might be healthy, overweight, unhealthy or weak.\nSo, option B: malnourised cannot be the answer. In option C: fit, the only option which does not have some negative connotation is 'fit', hence it is the answer. \nAnswer: C: fit\n\nInput: The cats were in a line and were lined up, where are they head", "answer": "B: city"}

Choices A: fighters B: swimmers C: hunters D: omnivores E: mammals\nRationales:\n1. The problem statement identifies cows as herbivores. We'll seek out a suitable response with the same characteristic by looking over the given choices.\n2. We know that the term \u2018fighting\u2019 is one of the characteristics of hunter animals, which refers to animals that eat meat, and that such animals are commonly classified as carnivores.\n3. Next, we know that swimming is what defines animals that are aquatic, such as the fish.\n4. Hence it stands to reason that \u2018fighting\u2019 and \u2018swimming\u2019 are not suitable answers since they do not line up with the word herbivore.\n5. Then we know that \u2018fighting and swimming\u2019 both involve the word water, while \u2018hunting\u2019 refers to killing animals.\n6. The word hunting can help us to think of animals that are carnivores. This is helpful, but we still need an answer that aligns with herbivore. \n7. Remember that cows are herbivorous animals, so they rely on or consist primarily of plant material to thrive.\n8. Hence, we know that the animals that are herbivorous are referred to by the term \u2018mammals.\u2019\n9. We can conclude that the option that describes a mammal with the same characteristics as that of the cow is \u2018mammals,\u2019 and not \u2018hunters.\u2019\n10. As such, we get our answer for the final question.\nAnswer: A) Mammals\nInput: Why might a person have been a smelly person at an event?

Choices:  B: front side C: front D: face E: two heads\nRationales: The question revolves around flipping a coin and looking for some particular feature on the front side of the coin(man or woman).\n1. The answer has to be in the choices\n2. None of the choices describe either the man or woman.\n3. Since this question only describes where to find the man or woman and not actually the man and woman, we already have enough information to rule out the choice man.\n4. We are left with two choices; one (Flip a coin and look at the front side of the coins) is more of a statement, it tells us how to flip the coin, and the other gives us the information about flipping the coin without describing what is on the front.\n5. Hence, we can eliminate C (front) and D (faces) and this gives us E (front) as the correct answer.\nAnswer: E, front\n\nInput: Some cities allow people to bring bikes on public transportation. Choices:  A. metro B. bus C. U-Bahn D. sky train E. subway\nRationales: None of the choices describe what \"public transportation\" is, so we can eliminate them entirely.\n1. It is an option, as it is stated in the question that \"some cities\" allow people to bring bicycles on subways.\n2. This option describes what a \"subway\" is when describing people or how to bring bicycles with people travelling on a subway.\n3. Therefore, the correct answer is \"subway\".\nAnswer: E, subway\n\nInput: What was the result of the election vote?

A: sunshine B: wind C: heat from the earth D: ice-melting E: cold water\nRationales:1. The question states that we need to exclude an option that does not help to produce or generate energy.\n2. The other options are forms of energy generated from natural sources of heat such as sunshine, wind, and earth.\n3. All these three choices are forms of energy where the heat or the light is either a result of a process related to that source or in some case, the origin.\n4. Hence there is no viable candidate that doesn't help to produce energy. \n5.

Choices:   A: very short B: not long at all C: rather long D: at least several hours E: approximately twenty minutes\nRationales:  1. The question is about the length of the wait at the hospital.\n2. Considering the other options we can infer that the choice could be a statement about a duration of time (A: very short, B: not long at any, and C: rather long).\n3. However, the term 'at least' implies uncertainty in the context of the situation, specifically the duration of time. For example, 'at least several hours' doesn't give a direct indication of a period of time but rather implies it could extend past several hours.\n4. The idea of uncertainty associated with statements about time, specifically the duration, are closely tied to statements that involve duration. One of them is \"a period of time, say an hour\".\n5. Since the hospital setting involves people waiting, it is possible to use the context here to infer that 'at least several hours', though not directly addressing the time, is speaking to the duration that the wait could take which is'several hours'.\nAnswer: D: at least several \n\nInput: After a long", "answer": "E: menu"}

Therefore, 'E', 'A', and 'B' are invalid because they wouldn't get the person out of their house.\n2. 'D' could be the answer, we would take them from their fire to an unthreatened area but we would have to drive them to the hospital.\n3.

We are notified the old carpet has been damaged, so we need to ascertain the area where the replacement carpet is manufactured.\n3. Looking at the given options, only options C: floor and E: closet are suitable locations for a carpet to be replaced.\n4. However since both options have no specified reference to damage, they aren't enough to make a logical association.\n5. Option A: \"hallway\" and Option D: \"living room\" do not provide sufficient information.\n6. Option B: \"staircase\" and Option E: \"closet\" are both locations where carpet replacement manufacturing could occur if damage was to occur.\n7.

Choices: A: night B: day C: sunset D: twilight E: dawn\nRationales:1. The question revolved around the characteristics of a fisherman, so the context gives the context of the fisherman's job.\n2. Usually, fishermen fish during the night or in the day, either in the early morning or afternoon.\n3. So, we look for the choice that applies to a fisherman's job more appropriately.\n4. Choice \"A: night\". is too direct so we eliminate it.\n5. Looking at the remaining four options, choice \"D: twilight\" is the best choice. This is because in this context, twilight refers to the best time for fishing. Moreover, a fisherman is described as someone who wa5its for the fish. So, when twilight is described as the time \"fisherfolk waits for bait\" we can see that the job of fishermen is to wait for the fish to show up. This satisfies the question, and so, the answer is D.\nAnswer: D. twilight\n\nInput: The professor was very well known, he was known to what?

A cashier closing a store is likely to have more time to focus on closing a register before leaving for the day. This would mean that they would probably have to open up a register in order to start closing the store for the day.\n4. The answer is B:to finish the day.\n5. Another possibility is that the cashier is actually starting their shift for the first time which would be on a day after it has been closed.\n\nAnswer: B:to finish the days\n\nInput: Where did the bear discover the treasure? Choices: 1:In a box 2.Next to a cabin 3:Beside a mountain 4:Near a rocky roadside 5:In the corner\nRationales: The bear might have discovered the treasure in any of the four options.\nInput: Where is this person's room most likely to be? Choices: In front of my car, beside someone else's car, the backside of my car, beside a car, behind me\nRationales: Since the choice includes the name of a car, the possibilities include all these places except in the front of someone else's car. That can never be the case since'my car' is always the first person whose car it is. Furthermore, a person's room (room with a bed, pillow and blanket) is more likely to be behind them (where they can easily reach it when they are asleep) than 'beside another person' because there would need to be a living room where people meet other people for chatting, and it is unlikely that they sleep next to each other.\nInput: What has been found?

Choices A: chocolate B: bananas C: vanilla D: peppers E: car\nRationales: Given: \"This is true of me,\". We know that \"me\" refers to personality in this instance.\n\nAs such, \" This is true of me.\" can be represented by the sentence \"I am _____.\"\n\nThe blank can be filled in with any noun that matches the personality description.\nExample sentences: ______, ______, ____;\n\n\"This is true of me.\" is an independent clause. (can stand on its own as a complete sentence.)\n\nNow the question comes.\n\nWhat is the answer to: \"This is true for me, but would not ________?\"\n\nThe answer key: \"This is true ______ me\"\n\nThe answer key implies: This is true for ______ me.\n\nThis can also be represented as;\n\n\"This _____ is true for me.\"\n\nNow, given the possible answers:\n\nWhat could be the answer if \"This is true for _____\". is rephrased to \"I am _____\"?\n\nThe answer choices are:\n\nA: chocolate\n\nB: bananas\n\nC: vanilla\n\nD: peppers\n\nE: car\n\nSince it is specified: \"______, but would not be _______.\"\n\nThe only possible choice to be considered for an answer is a noun which is not true for \"this\" or \"me\".\n\nA: chocoaltes are the only items in the list that are consumable and not true for \"me\".\n\nAs such, we know that this cannot be the answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: Car.\n\nAnswer: E: car\n\nInput: Some countries can only be found on the continent Africa, where might they be located?

Choices: A: runs B: rests C: heats D: does not run E: is off\nRationales:    1. We are asked to find the option that identifies what a computer uses the most electical power for at a given moment. \n2. We know that 'electrical power' is a resource that is used to operate different components in the computer.\n3. At any given time, running, heating, and not running are the main states of a computer based on its general actions or purposes.\n4. Of the given options, we know that 'running' uses the most electricalpower. To know whether it's the most, we determine if'resting' using the least amount of power.\n5. Therefore: What is used the most? Running, yes?\n6. 'not running' or 'off' will not use much electrical power. So we can eliminate those options.\n7. 'running' will use the most power.\n8.

What did the parrot do? Choices: 1: bite hard A: fly away B: chirp loudly C: look surprised E: get scared\nRationales:1. The problem statement provides two descriptions of a situation: a parrot is eating a banana and was disturbed/startled by a \"fox\".\n2. It is clear that the parrot was startled, and the sentence says that it was \u201cdisturbed\u201d or \u201cstartled\u201d.\n3. It is more likely to have been startled/disturbed than startled/disturbed.\n4. The disturbed parrot was \"eating a banana.\" It would need to have eaten or finished the banana before getting up to fly away.\n5. Therefore Option 1 is the most suitable answer to fit the context. \nA: The parrot \"got up\" and \"flew away\". \nB: The parrot \"let out a chirp and flew away\" \nC: The parrot \"chirped and flew away\"\n\nAnswer: A: fly away\n\nInput: Someone who wants to become an airline pilot should do what?

The question asks us the answer to a general knowledge question about animals.\n2. Since the answer to the question is the correct one, it's clear that animals 'carvores' and 'insectivores' are two categories of animals with a wide diversity to choose from.\n3. Based on the question's structure, the options, 'Lions', 'Bears', 'Rabbits', and 'Peguins', are not chosen from 'Carnivores' or 'Insectivores' because they have not been excluded.\n4. So, which animal is not in these two categories? \n5. Let's start at the beginning of the list: 'Lions' - carvore  - no match\n6. 'Bears' - not an insectivore  - no match \n7. 'Rabbits' - not a carvore  - a match \n8. 'Penguins' - not a carivore  - a match\n9. Therefore, the correct answer is D: rabbits.\nAnwer: E: penguins\n\nInput: Which two words are anagrams?

The options can either refer to a person, a thing, or a location.\nWe need to rule out 'A: open', 'B: close', 'C: lock', and 'D: clamp' because each of the options is not a country or a city.\nThese options could be city names in different countries for all we know.\nIn the context of the question, cities like Vienna are in Austria which is a country, we're looking for countries.\nTherefore, we should eliminate 'A: open', ''B: close','C: lock' and 'D: clamps'.\nSo, the correct answer is E: 'Vienna'\n\nAnswer: E:'Vienna'", "answer": "B: desk"}

The most colorful I ever saw was in the what? Choices: A: woods B: jungle C: grass D: desert E: garden\nRationales: The question asks about the most colorful bird a person has ever seen. To determine the correct response, we need to identify the context and determine their characteristic. \n1. The question provides one bit of context by mentioning that some birds are very colorful. \n2. We can infer from this statement that the most colorful bird the person has encountered is also one of these colorful birds. \n3. The context also mentions that such colorful birds are sometimes louder, which is a relevant clue because the person may mention the location where they've encountered such a bird. \n4. With respect to the remaining contextual statements in the question, we know that the word'seen' indicates that the person has physically observed the bird or heard its call. \n5. Lastly, we know that the most colorful person has seen, as an attribute, is a bird. As the person is specific about the bird, we can eliminate option 'A: woods'. \n6. With respect to options B: 'jungle' and C: 'grass', they are not places where birds are especially loud. In the question, we see that this person witnesses both color and sound, so we can exclude these options. \n7. If we continue to look at the other options, we see that option D: 'desert' is a viable choice because deserts are places where people encounter a lot of colorful, loud birds, but it's not the place in which the person has ever seen the most colorful bird ever. \n8. Therefore, from the above explanation, the answer must be option E: 'the garden'.\nAnswer: E: the garden", "answer": "E: earth"}

Choices: A: lake B: mountain C: beach D: volcano F: waterfall\nRationales: The question refers to a desirable or ideal location to live. Therefore, we need to select an option that indicates that the location has an advantageous trait or feature.\nThe keyword is'safe' that indicates protection from harm or a state free from adversity.\nTherefore, all the options except F need to be eliminated.\nHence the correct answer would be D because volcanoes are usually known to eject molten lava (a form of liquid matter) and volcanic rocks, thereby increasing the temperature of the entire area in which it erupts. This makes the volcano an unsafe place to live, which is the opposite of what the question is addressing.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: Who might be eating a strawberry? Choices:  C: strawberries D: ants E: chimpanzees F: monkeys G: gorillas\nRationales: In this question, the word 'Strawberries' indicates the food being eaten.\nHence, any animal that eats this food has to be named, as the options are only animals.\nIn addition, considering the word 'cows' to be a wrong answer in the option C, it can be eliminated.\nSimilarly, Cows are not ants, so this option C: Strawberries D: Ants E: Chimpoanas, F: Monkeys G: gorilla is the correct choice.\nAnswer: C, D, E, F, G: chimpanzees\n\nInput: The scientist was amazed by the new invention.

Choices:  a: down b: up c.: sideways\nRationales:  1. The context is 'I feel I must not have a lost my mind' as it refers to whether we are losing our mind or not.\n2. The last two words of the sentence, 'but I've realized the trick is not what it seems', imply that our situation is not what it appears to be.\n3. In other words, our current state or the truth is not the real situation or truth.\n4. When looking at the available choices, we can interpret which direction we may be heading. For instance, if it is saying that we aren't heading down, then it means that we are indeed heading up.\n5. Thus, we can pick a choice that aligns with the statement given.\n6. 'B: up' fits the situation because the statement given indicates that we are not heading down which means we are moving up.\n7.

The quote reads: \n> \"Some have given their lives to us, many serve others.\"\n2. As it is, it seems like the quote is making points about what types of people will be useful to us.\n3. This is because it speaks of those who have given their lives to benefit us, and others that serve others.\n4. Based on this, the answer, \"Some have given their live to us, many serve us.\", makes sense.\n5. However, the answer from the choices that would most apply to the specific message given in the quote is: \"All serve others.\"\n6. The other answers are unlikely to make sense when we consider the actual intentions of the quote and the points it makes.\n7. For example, \"None will ever be useful\" does not match the type of points or message being made in the quote.\nInput: What did the bakers use to make these cakes?

{"text": "capabilities. \n7. Hence, out of all the choices, the one that provides the most context to the question is 'tree'.\nAnswer: E: tree\n\nInput: Where did the person who could read a book? Choices:  D: bookstore E: library F: museum G: school H: university\nRationales: The question is looking for the answer 'the person who could read a books.' The main context behind this is that the person is capable of reading a book. \n6. Accordingly, we would expect the answer location to have some association with reading.\n7. From the choices provided, Option D can be eliminated because the context is about one person who can read a book, not where the book is located.\n8. Option E has a logical connection to the context, as it refers to a location that people can read at. But there are other options, besides libraries, where they can read: they can read at a museum (Option F), at school (Option G) or at university (Option H).\n9. From this, we know the answer has to have something to do with reading, or it wouldn't be the correct context.\n10. Thus, we move back to the five options that contain the world 'library' because they have both the context and the meaning.\n11. One of our elimination choices is Option D: Bookstore, so we can put it aside.\n12. Option E: Library is also eliminated because we already have a location where they can read.\n13. Therefore, the answer has to be Option B: Library.\nAnswer: B. Library\n\nInput: Tucked the towel.  In where might the towel eventually end up? Choices: A: oven B: washing machine C: dryer D: drainpipe E: washing machine\nRationales: Let's break down the problem statement as an 'in X' followed by 'where Y may end up'.\n7. Let's start by working through the context and the task. The context of the answer is that the towel is being placed somewhere because it is wet.\n11. We find out from the options that towels can end up 'in the oven', 'in the dryer', 'in the washing machine', and 'in the drainpipe'.\n15. This means that,", "answer": "C: dangerous"}

He said it's best to hold them until they reach which of following temperature? Choices: 195 fahrenheit degree C 180 fahrenheit degree C\nRationales: The question asks the chef's method for attaining the correct temperature for the chicken and the best temperature they can achieve.\n\nFirstly, we should determine whether the chef is referring to 'C' (degree Celsius) or 'F' (degree Fahrenheit) while giving the description of the temperatures in the context of cooking or temperatures that pertain to cooked food.\n\nOn second thought, while the statement provides the temperature range, that is 195-180 Fahrenheit, it's written in such a way that the range indicates a general desired temperature and not a degree.\nTo verify, we can look at the following scenario: 'I got a mark of 77% in the exam I took' (77 marks out of 100). Clearly, 77 falls in the range '1-101' and indicates the maximum possible marks one could attain. It doesn't give a defined range from which marks will be included. This implies that it's not a number range, but more of a range of possibility.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 195F and 180F refer to a temperature range where the desired mark would fall.\n\nThirdly, we know that the temperature range pertains to cooking or cooked food and not something else. Since the chef specifically mentioned holding the chicken until it reaches the best temperature, we deduce that it's important to the chef that they hold on until the chicken is at the best possible temperature.\n\nFourthly, when checking for possible answers to the question, we observe that all the offered choices are above or equal to the maximum range value, which includes the range value itself. Hence, we cannot include these choices as the right temperature in the answer.\n\nAnswer: the maximum range value, C\n\n### Instructions:Answer the stated question below.", "answer": "A: mouth"}

These can be various things like mountains, rivers, valleys, lakes, etc. The option that does justice to the given options is 'D' because 'Lake' is listed among the things that 'Could be Found Underground'.

Choices:  E: car 1879 A: car 1861 B: car 1884 C: car 1897 D: car 1834\nRationales: In a group, the oldest car is the oldest among all the cars in a group. The given options describe the age of the cars in a random order as well as some of the significant years when cars were launched. The oldest car is 1834 according to A, which is also given in B.\n\\(C\\) is the first option that includes a year that is not among the given options, so it is ruled out.\nIn D, the most significant year from the options available is 1897 (if the newest is 1884, then the oldest must be at least as far as 1897), so it should be eliminated, and the answer should be either A or B.\n\nAnswer: A: car 1484 or B: car 1634", "answer": "C: table"}

Choices: \nA: East B: West C: North D: South E: Any of the six directions\nRationales:\n1. The problem states that the dog ran ahead and that there was a flick of cows in the dog's vision.\n2. The dog did not specify the direction that he ran ahead in, which implies that the dog ran at a direction different from the cows' location.\n3. From the question we can conclude that the cows were running in one direction and that the dog was running in the opposite direction.\n4. From the problem's description, we can conclude that the direction of the dog would not be the same as the direction of the cow's location (from the previous step).\n5. Analyzing the given options, options A: East and B: West cannot be chosen because East and West are directions and not locations.\n6. Option C: North cannot be chosen either, as the dog's current location was at North direction (from his running direction). Hence, it must be assumed that the cows are running in a different direction than him. As the dog is running in the opposite direction, the cows would be running in a West direction.\n7. Similarly, the dilemma can be resolved for Option D: South as the dog's location is not at a South direction. Hence, South is eliminated as a possible location of the cows.\n8. Option E: Any of the Six Directions is incorrect because the description says that the dog ran in a direction that is not the same as the direction the cows are traveling in. We have already ruled out all the different directions so that this choice can be eliminated.\nAnswer: B West - The dog and the cows must be moving on opposite sides of this coordinate\n\nInput: How do the dishes get washed?

Choices:  A; tree B: outside C: grass D: branches E: tall place\nRationales: Answer:B: outside\n1. A giraffe can only be found in high places because it has special capabilities like a very long neck.\n2. The statement talks about the place where giraffes feed on leaves so that makes the environment of their feeding place important because that is what is related to the leaves they feed on.\n3. The environment is outside which makes the grass, branches, and tree as the only places which giraffes can be found in.\n\n### Feedback: The following students did not understand how to write an appropriate response for this task.\n\nBelow are some suggestions to improve your response:\n\nYou can take another attempt here: [https://python.org/practice/489480/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/interactive/2014/09/18/f9d5140c-360c-11e4-87dd-59e049e88f11_story.html)", "answer": "A: open meadow"}

B: on a track 3. C: on a basketball court 4. D: in a karate training center 5. E on a volleyball field\nRationales: We have a question asking us about a person who specializes in learning skills. We have to look at the choices and understand whether a person will primarily or significantly learn a skill in a place where one is most likely to obtain one's skill or knowledge. With five locations, we can eliminate two: a soccer field and a track are places primarily intended for sports competitions or training. They were not designed for the purpose of learning skills or knowledge directly at the place in question. The same could be said for an athletic field. Therefore we are left with three choices: a basketball court, a karate training center, and a volleyball field. A basketball court is a place where someone might learn the most important skills. However, a karate training program is more specialized, specifically targeting the skills and knowledge associated with a particular sport like Karate. Thus, the answer is B: on a track.\nAnswers: Choices (1 to 5): A, B, C, D, E\n\nAnswer: B: on a track\n\nInput: Marmots live in high places. They are animals that they can make their homes in.

E: animals who sleep in water\nRationales: Choice (D): treeclimbers: is the answer to the question. Treeclimbers are animals that they can move up. They are people who climb up the tree.

E: loyalty\nRationales: The question asks about the situation where you see a lone soldiers standing guard.\n1. Considering the choices, it's likely that the soldiers could be exhibiting one of the qualities or traits described in the list because they are usually the ones who serve in this capacity.\n2. Option C: 'duty' is not necessarily the only characteristic the group of choices would be encompassing.\n3. Another option is 'pride', which would also be suitable considering that the person serving this duty and performing the duties on the behalf of the military is someone who likely takes pride in their country.\n4. Since the options contain words such as 'bravery', 'loneliness', 'confidence', and 'loyalty' which each refer to aspects of the person standing guard, the qualities of this person should be considered.\n5. Among the traits offered, 'confidence' is probably the trait that fits the best as it is the most direct way to describe and exemplify a person who is proud of themselves and their country and willing to stand guard on their country's behalf.\n6. If you choose the choice that conveys the strongest meaning or description then the answer is C: responsibility.\n7. The word 'duty' means a responsibility or a task that is associated with a job or role or position in an organization or group. As can be inferred by the context, soldiers usually stand guard based on a duty given to them to protect the place they are standing guard.\n8. In this case, it's likely they were assigned to stand guard by their superiors and have been given authority to do so.\n9. Hence, the answer to the task is C: Duty.\nAnswer: 3.5) C: Duty\n\nInput: Why is this toy only available in one place?

{"text": "characteristic.\n7. Thus, the location where Marmots can use their hands for upward motion is a 'tree' or 'rocky hillside'.\n\nInput: It is important to understand that no matter what people decide on, they are likely to be upset about one decision or another.  What is the likelihood? Choices:  I: high II: low III: low IV: moderate V: moderate VI: quite high \nRationales:\n1. Highlighting the keywords: \"likely to be upset... one decision or another\", the word \"likely\" has an implication that at least some will be upset about the choice or decision, either option A or option B.\n2. For example, if option A or option B is the decision made, the person making the choice would be upset because they could not make the other option.  In this way, we can infer that \"likely to be upsets\" can refer to someone's displeasure over not being able to make the other decision in a choice.\n3. In essence, the person could only be either 'highly upset' or 'quite upset'.\n4. This means that when making the statement, you are trying to imply that if an individual is highly upset about a decision, they are most likely to be that way about a choice.  Similarly, if they are quite upset, it's likely that they are the same about any choice they encounter.  Since there are two extremes for 'highly upset', it would then be necessary to infer that 'quite upset' covers both extremes.  According to this, we can say that 'quite upsets' represents the majority of people who are likely to be upsets regardless of what their final decision turns out to be. \n5. There are two extremes in Option III: 'low', which means highly upset and 'not at all', which means not at all upset.  As with previous options, we can then infer that people are most likely to be 'quite upset', which has already been covered.\n6. Similarly, option V:'moderate', which means neither highly nor quite upset, does not have unique qualities that distinguish it from other options that fall into the same range of upset.  They are all the same and can easily be accounted for by the other more", "answer": "B: anthology"}

Choices:  D: one who does many things B: a very young person C: a person working at a pizza place E: a young person who has much experience F: a very capable worker\nRationales: Generally, people are called pizza boys when they are working at a place that sells pizza.\nBut, in this example, the answer refers to the entire name and not just who works at a particular pizza store.\nThis rules out the words B, D, and E. They refer to just what jobs one performs or what level of skill one possesses.\nThe description of 'one who does many things' is not what the question describes.\nNext, we should take a look at the words A and C which refer to very young or young people.\nA pizza boy is not limited to these types of people since they could do it at any age.\nTherefore, this answer is also not correct.\nWe will therefore focus on F, as it fits the description, in which a pizza boy is a person who is very capable.\nIt seems to be the correct answer because you can say that someone who does many things can also be a person who is very young or young.\nSo F is the answer.\nAnswer: F: a very capable person\n\n### Task:\nRead the following sentence, the underlined portion may contain a spelling error.

Choices:  a. high heel c b lace ups c d. flip flops b. suede\nRationales: This is a question that asks about a chiffon dress and its compatibility with a particular shoe.\n1. From the options, it is apparent that only options A, B and C are relevant.\n2. Looking further, it is evident that D cannot be chosen. This is because a chiffon dress is often worn for formal or semi-formal occasions and therefore would not be appropriate footwear for shoes like flip flops which are often used in casual or leisure situations.\n3. The same is true of the option C, \"lace up\" shoes which could be used in leisure or sports activities but not so much for formal occasions.\n4. The option, A, can be chosen. The reason for this is that a \"high heel\" is best suited, in combination with a chiffon dress, for formal occasions such as weddings and parties.\n5. B, the correct choice, is \"sandals\", which is commonly worn for casual occasions when the dress code is relaxed or a dress is not required.\n\nOutput: Sandals.\n\n\nInput: If there's a chance for a rainy day, which is appropriate?

However, an \"umbrella\"  is more portable than an \"umbrella\", and \"poncho,\" and can be easily carried around.\n2. In addition, it is less likely that an \"umbrella \" would get wet, making it a convenient choice in the case of rain.\n3.

The statement describes the kids laughing so hard that it provoked certain responses.\n2. All the choices here are things that could occur as a result of extreme laughter caused by a clown's performance.\n3. But the question asks about what happened after the kids stopped laughing. While other choices are acceptable answers, they do not necessarily reflect that the laughter ended.\n4. Therefore, we can rule out 'B: laughing', 'C: laughing', and 'D: yelling' as they don't indicate the cessation of laughter.\n5. Similarly, we can also eliminate option 'E: falling over' because the kids are said to start laughing after seeing the performance of the clown and thus are not likely to have been laughing hard enough to fall.\n6. We're left with 'A: crying' and 'B: dying'. However, these two answers are inconsistent with a description that states 'laughing hard'.\n7. Furthermore, option B: 'dying' would not be expected in this context. Hence, the correct answer is A: crying.\nAnswer: A. crying\n\nInput: What happens to the body when it dies? It's what?

All choices are possible, valid answers, but some are more suitable and appropriate than others.\n3. We can rule out choices E: discreet. This is a verb. In the phrase 'what happens to the body when someone dies', this phrase is more applicable or consistent with the term 'it's'.\n4. However, we can't ignore the fact that the verb phrase 'when someone dies' is not explicitly stated. Therefore, we have to work the phrase into our answer without altering the sentence", "answer": "E: fatigue"}

Choices:  B: he got lazy  A: his legs were useless  C: his legs were broken  D: he had car trouble\nRationales:\n1. The problem statement states that the man went by elevators because his legs became useless.\n2. From the options, we see that 'A: his legs were useless' and 'C: his legs were broken' refer to his legs being paralyzed.\n3. But he would still have the ability to walk using his hands because humans, even those who are paralyzed, have the ability to use their hands.\n4. The phrase \"his legs were useless\" refers to the man being on complete wheelchairs where he can't even use his hands normally.\n5. The phrase \"his broken\" leg refers to a man who is in a broken wheelchair where he can't use his hands.\n6.

The choice B: The leftmost/most left-facing area is the region that is closest to the vertical axis as viewed from the outside.\n2. The region would lie to the left of the straight horizontal line of the map. \n3.

Looking at the options, we can eliminate 'G: Gallery' because a bicycle is usually a large machine that we don't typically display in the gallery.\n8. From F: 'basement', a 'bicycle' usually comes from the outdoors and is parked or stored in some corner of a basement or warehouse.\n9.

The statement of best indicates where we may find the best type of beans.\n\n8. We understand that we may find beans in a 'warehouse','shop','supermarket', or'store'.\n9. While any of these locations may have ordinary, decent beans, it's more likely that this is describing a 'warehouse' or 'warehouse'.\n10. If this were a question about normal beans, any of the locations given would be reasonable.\n11. In that case, a reasonable answer would be B: 'warehouse' or C:'store'.\n12.

C: leave it in the pot. D: sweeten it E: strain out the leaves.\nRationales:1. The choice of tea itself indicates that the question asks about making tea taste better.\n2. It implies that tea itself may be unpleasant (as an object) if the tea flavor has a distinctly unpleasant flavor on its own.\n3. Consider the remaining options given, it can be seen that options 'A: put honey in', and 'C: leave it in the tea pot' indicate the objective of improving a drink's flavor. This choice is not viable because the question asks how to make tea taste better, not honey.\n4. 'B: put honey in' and 'D: sweeten it' are viable options because that is how one typically improves a drink's flavors.\n5. 'B: put in honey' is clearly the more viable option because honey is generally accepted as a sweetener. In addition, 'B: put hone' and 'D:sweeten' can both serve the purpose of altering tea's flavor to create a \"better\" object. Therefore. 'B: put it in honey' is the most viable option.\nAnswer: B, put it in honey.\n\nInput: I enjoy doing this, and that. I'll never be able to do this, however.. Choices:  A. paint a picture B. climb a mountain C. go swimming D. make a cake E. write a song\nRationales:The key to understanding the question is to focus on the part of the question that states \"I'll never be able...\". \n1. Given that, this gives us the idea that whatever we're doing can't be done in the future. \n2. Therefore we should look at the part prior to the 'however' and ignore options that imply doing in the future. 3. We know that there's no way we can'make a cake' without baking it in the oven, which implies future action. Therefore, we", "answer": "A: hurry along"}

Choices:  B: chop C: hack D: prune E: saw\nRationales:  1. The question is a general question about a carpenter's profession.\n2. The question is referring specifically to the activity of cutting down trees.\n3. The term 'chop' does not refer to an act of cutting down trees at all. \n4. Like 'chop', 'hack' also does not refer to cutting down a tree. \n5. 'Pruning' refers to the activity of trimming away parts of the tree to maintain its shape, therefore, it does not cut down a tree.\n6. 'Saw' is the only action which refers to the cutting of a tree. So, the correct answer is B: saw \nAnswer: B : saw\n\nInput: To what do we add a zero when we know how much the cash was? Choices:  E. more and more F. less and less G. to and fro H. up and down I. upside down\nRationales:     1. The question is about adding a zero to the given quantity, while still maintaining the original quantity in the same order.\n2. Cash amounts are often added together in numerical sequences, with each added cash having the same order e.g. $1.50, $6.00, $2.30\n3. Thus, from the given options in the question choices, 'less and less', 'to and fro', 'upside down', and'more and more' should be ruled out as they each involve a shift in the order of the sequence.\n4. Similarly, 'I. upside down' does not make sense because the amounts of the cash are irrelevant when they are multiplied (as the question is essentially multiplying these by 'zero' for the sake of 'adding the original order to it').\n5. Thus, the correct answer is H. up and down, since all other choices do not maintain the same sequence order.\nAnswer: H.up and down\n\nInput: What place doesn't get much rain?

What was the dog chewing? Choices:  The dog, A: my paper B: his paper C: the page D: the piece E: the bite\nRationales: Firstly, the sentence indicates that the dog ate my paper.\n1. We also know that it was folded so we need to think about possible objects left once the folding is done.\n2. Option C: The page, doesn't fit the context of the sentence. If there were some folding done, it implies that the piece/side of the page was not touched.\n3. Option D: The piece, does not make any sense. If the dog ate a piece, there must be enough left for a bite.\n4. If there was a piece left, there must be some bite/remainders which the dog ate.\n5. Hence, option B: my paper or D: the bite makes logical sense and is the correct answer.\n6. A: The dog doesn't make sense either.

Choices:  T: on a roof A: inside B: stolen C: next to D: outside\nRationales: Looking at the question, an apple is a food item. We must consider the word 'in'. An apple can be 'in' a cup, 'inside' a tree, 'inside' an apple crate, and so on. In this case, we're also given 'outside'. How can an Apple be 'in' outside?\nSince there are two potential answers, we need to use 'OR' logic to eliminate all the wrong answers.\n\n1. 'A: inside' cannot fit since it's part of the question. Eliminate A.\n2. 'T: on a roof' cannot be correct as an apple cannot fit in a roof. Eliminate T.\n3.

Considering all the given choices, only B: because they are'small' and C: because the colors 'are very rich' make sense in the context of the question to refer to candy.\n2. Choices D: 'cause it is so unheathy' and E: 'because it is so unhealty' are misspellings of 'unhealthy', so we eliminate those answers.\n3. In the case of 'B: because they are small', we're not clear exactly what the word 'they' refers to, so we eliminate this choice as well.\n4.

The sentence structure is 'Machine X Y'\nThe sentence refers to an ice cream maker.\nThe machine that makes ice creams can be ice cream blender, freezer, sorbet maker, or cooler.\nCooler and freezer are not a machine that makes ice creaming.\nFreezer/cooler/ice cream maker is needed to be in front of ice cream.\nTherefore, only A or E is a correct answer.\nAnswer to the following multiple choice item: ice cream blender\n\nInput: Which of the following types of vehicles has the largest tires?

Choices: \nA: banana B: mana C: bona D: mona E: none\nRationales:1. The question asks about a word that is spoken aloud and results in the inversion of the last consonant.\n2. Since the only letters that occur at the end of a word are vowels and consonants, there are only vowel and consonant-ending words possible.\n3. There are five options that end in vowels that are spoken aloud, but they are not inversion patterns. \n4.

Choices are:\n```yes```\n> this answer can be considered true. But it does not mean that it's always accurate, it could just as well be false.\nTherefore, `yes` is not the correct answer.\n2. `no` would mean that the act does not work and can be assumed true in every situation.\nNo is the exact opposite of yes, and can be used as true/false, therefore, doesn't apply to the question.\n3. `sure` is ambiguous and could be either a correct answer or incorrect.\nHowever, since it's not the only answer, `sure` cannot be considered.\n4. `probably` is a correct answer, however it doesn't answer the question with as much assurance. Also, there is no `probably` as a response, so choose the other answer.\n\n5. We can conclude either that `true is the correct answer or it depends`.\nIt is left to the reader to make the choice.\nAnother thing to note is that the response is only \"May be\" by the interviewer.\nTherefore, even if your answer is no or depends it might not be accepted as the question still asks whether \"beating your chest while punching your own fist is beneficial\" or not.\nAlso, this means that the answer \"beating your chests and punching your own fingers with your hands is not beneficial\" is not applicable because it is a wrong answer in accordance to the questions context.\n\nInput: Which of the three items should I wear?

According to a professor this is because eagles are born knowing how to, Choices:  A. be brave, B. take risks, C. work alone, D. eat meat, E. kill large animals\nRationales: We can easily see from the options that 'Be brave' could be a characteristic of an eagle. This is incorrect because an eagle is born knowing how to behave fearless of something. This is the wording the professor has to use in the blank.\nWe can also eliminate 'Take risks' because for many people 'be brave' and 'take risks' are synonyms but the professor uses the term 'knows how to'.\nWe can eliminate 'Work alone' since the description of eagles does not refer to them working alone. We can also eliminate 'Eat Meat' as it is not incompatible with a bird of such height. 'Kill large animals' sounds like the most accurate statement but the professor only says 'eat meat' not kill large animals.\nThe eagle has to eat meat in order to survive. However it has to have meat in order to find its prey. It does no eating it is already dead (or the eagle has captured it before this). The professor is confusing eating with taking it as its prey.\nThe professor could also be trying to say that it has predator instincts and is able to spot the predators before the prey does.\nThe professor could be trying to say eagles know how to catch other animals larger than themselves without getting caught and eaten by the animal it will be eating.\nEagles do not have to be caught by other animals because they have wings that can take them up to great heights.\nSince the professor is a professor we have to make a correction so 'Know' sounds more natural. 'Know' means having knowledge or understanding.\nThe final answer should be that eagles are born having knowledge and understanding of how to be brave and take risks.\nAnswer: Brave/Risk/Know\n\nInput: He's very tall and very athletic, what is wrong with his posture?

Thus, we are narrowing it down to the two remaining choices, \"flying\" and/or \"high tech\".\n4. However, \"flying\" does not really correspond to the blank, as it is describing a \"plane\", which is flying in the air (at an altitude). \n5.

Choices:  A. yes B. no C. either D. both E. neither\nRationales: The patient gives a clear and succinct response, indicating they chose something in response to the doctor's question. The question is a general yes/no question.  We need to determine which words the patient used in their answer.\n2. Options A, B, and E are words the patient could have used.  The word \"constantly\" is present in each of these options.  The word \"continuously\" is present in options A and B. We need a word that has the same meaning as the word 'constantly'.\n3. Option D provides a correct answer.  We have a word that means something that happens repeatedly 'over and over'.  'Constantly' has a similar meaning.  Using Option D, the doctor asks the patient about their pain, and the patient says either 'yes' or they have pain (which would mean the patient is having the pain 'both over and over', this matches up to the meaning of the word 'constantly').\n4. Option B is incorrect, and the patient does not respond here at all. 'Intermittent' is a word that would likely be used to describe pain that occurs at different times, not at either different times or the same time.  Because the patient has not answered, or used one of the options, we can eliminate it as an answer.\n5. The same goes for option C, the doctor did not ask the patient if the pain occurs both.  Either, or both, would be used.\nAnswer: D. either\n\nInput: Does the bookstore have a stockist?  For any given bookstore, a stockist is someone who provides them with what?

Choices:  A. brake B. steer C. accelerate D. slow down E. make a hard turn Rationales: 1) The sentence has a 'not' (negation) operator and a causality word (cause-effect) connecter in it: 'If you go too fast,...' 2) The sentence describes how too fast speed will result in making a turn with a sharpness that is 'too low'. 3) In addition to having 'too low' as a description, the answer should be related to sharpness itself - A. brake B: steer C: accelerate D: slow down E: make a hard turn. 4) After narrowing down the answer option to include only word pairs which describe sharpness or difficulty related to sharpness, all the options still work except 'accelerate' and'slow down' which are not descriptors of sharpness. 5) Only 'D: slow down' remains a possibility because it's related to low sharpness, and it's the closest to the cause-effect wording we have in the sentence - '...you have trouble making...' 6) Finally, the rest of the sentence (after'making') describes how lower sharpness can be related to 'hard' or 'impossible' turns or 'too close' turns. So only one of the choices left as an option should address 'too close'. 7) The only choice that does this is 'E: make a hard turn' which is the right answer.

Choices: \tA: champagne B: water C: orange juice D: apple juice E: coffee\nRationales:\tThe problem statement is straightforward. It simply refers to what citizens of the south of France drink for breakfast.\n\tTherefore, there's no need to infer additional information from the sentence.\n \tThe given 'choices' can easily be discounted as they do not reflect breakfast cuisine for the south of France.\n \tOnly 'A: champagne' and 'B: water' seem plausible.\n \tIn France, beverages are typically reserved as after-meal drinks.\n \tThis means that they are not commonly consumed during meals which are typically breakfast.\n \tAn alternative drinking tradition that takes place during meals is to serve wine.\n\tThis would not make sense for an early-morning meal and is not commonly done in the South of France.\n \nConclusion:\n\tWe can reasonably infer that the south of France does not typically consume either champagne or water for breakfast.\n\tWe can further conclude that the citizens would typically drink another beverage instead as it is more common there.\n\tSince the word 'lot' was used, we can ascertain that this breakfast cuisine is commonplace.\n \tWe are left with 'D: apple juice' and 'E: coffee.'\n\tDue to the description, we can rule out 'E' because coffee is typically reserved as a mid-morning drink after the other 'lot' of breakfast beverage has been consumed.\n \tTherefore, 'D: apple juices' is the correct choice because it meets all the key requirements of the question.\nAnswer: D. apple juices", "answer": "D: being happy"}

Choices: 1: dance studio 2: theatre 3: church 4: movie studio 5: basketball court\nRationales: The sentence tells us that the choreography relied upon \"precise timing to make sense.\" This implies that some movements will stand out more if they are done at the correct moments. Let's analyze the choices provided. \n\n1. The 'dance studio' is an incorrect answer choice. The question is telling us that the choreographer was careful about making sense of the dance movements by timing them. This would not be a priority in the dance studio.\n2. The theatre is a type of location that might do the job. You're onstage, but the choreographer cannot just stop you in the middle of a show. Actions need to be performed precisely.\n3. A church sounds like it would be ideal for this choice. There are rules of time and etiquette that must be followed like during funerals the last person to leave the church has to turn off the lights, among others.\n4. This choice is a very general description. It does not say which type of'movie studio' is being referred to, so if it's a film set movie studio chances are it doesn't have a requirement for precision time.\n5. The basketball court is an incorrect answer choice, the basketball court isn't usually the type of place where precise time was required. A basketball player usually doesn't have much of a reason to be counting their steps to the basket.\n6. Only one choice matches the description: the theatre. The stage of a theatre is the one setting in a theatre that requires a strict and precise time when something happens on the stage. Therefore, the correct answer is the theatre. \n\nAnswer: The theatre.\n\nInput: How much money should the accountant put aside for this trip?

However, [b] stands for 'b', which is already been eliminated, and [e] for 'appearance' is not logical, while 'd' already took [C,D,E].

Where was the driver at this time Choices:  [1: bus driver's fault,2: driver's fault,3: bus driver's bad driving,4: bad road,5: fault of other travelers,6: good road] Rationales:1: The road conditions was what delayed the bus, because the bus arrived late because of the road condition. 2: The bus was late, so something bad must have happened on the road. 3: If the road condition is one of the root causes of the delay, then there were bad driving on the road was not expected to cause a bus with such bad driving, because if anything the bus driver must be blamed. Hence option 2 is expected. 4: \"Bad road\" is a term that does not make sense, since \"bad road\" is a road. Rather, it is more apt to say that the weather or the conditions of the bus is a bad road.

Choices: A: a difficult task  B: quite a hassle C: a complex affair  D: slightly challenging E: a little tricky F: a tension\nRationales:1. The question is saying something that is in the past and can no longer be done, however, people can still not do it to make the question logical.\n2. We can then rule out \u2018A: A difficult task\u2019 as people still cannot eat it and would be impossible to do so now.\n3. \u2018D: A little tricky\u2019 is the same meaning as A. It does not meet the criteria that the fruit is something that cannot be eaten.\n4. \u2018B: Quite a hassle\u2019 describes something that makes it difficult to do something in general. However, since we are referring to whether people can eat it, this would still meet the requirements as it is difficult to do something that is difficult for people in general.\n5. The fruit can only be eaten by either biting into it or eating the fruit while not biting into it.\n6. We can therefore rule out \u2018C: A complex affair\u2019 as this is describing something involving people doing something in a complicated way. Since the fruit is something that people cannot eat, this statement is inappropriate for the context.\n7. Hence we can say the fruit is \u2018F: A tension\u2019\n8.

Therefore 'tree' is the correct answer choice.\nAnswer: E. tree\n\nInput: A small bird, often confused to have big feet because its legs are long, is what? Choices: A: crane B: eagle C: falcon D: owl E: seagull\nRationales: The word context of the question indicates that the object \"often confused\" with the size of the feet is a \"bird\".\nBecause we are using the sentence, we can infer that the bird has feet, but they are not typically confused for their size.\nAlso, it is mentioned that the bird has leg. \nTherefore, in addition to having feet, this bird has legs.\nTherefore,the appropriate answer would be \"a) BIRD\".\n\nInput: A bird, often confused to be aggressive because of its size, is what? Choice A: eagle B: falcon C: heron D: owl E falcon\nRationales: As indicated in the word context of the question, the object \"often\" confused with its size is a \"bird\". \nHowever, it states that the bird is not \"aggressive\". Because we use the sentence, we can assume that the bird does have feathers, a beak, a single nostril on its nose, is not furry, is not hairless, is not a mammal, is not human, and is not any other similar bird.\nAnd it is said to be \"not aggressive\".\nTherefore,the correct answer would be \"E) BIRD\".

What was the player? Choices:  B: right fielder C: left fielder\nD: pitcher E: 2nd baseman\nRationales: Question is asking for the player's position instead of the player's name. \nThe statement implies that a person had the \"bad luck\" to be at a baseball game. There's a description of time for the game and time for luck in the form of a baseball season. The person refers to the person who experienced bad luck because that person was at a baseball game where the player was playing for the final year on the player's baseball career. Therefore, to get the correct answer, we have to look out for the key words that will give a hint.\n1. Option B does not meet the time description given in the question (\"final year\" in a baseball season).

However, the question asks for what a bird can be referred to as, which is different from what other names they go by. The only choices provided so far that speak to this are 'bird' and 'wing', as the names of the other birds are also names that a bird goes by, but not ones that the bird can be referred to by. The word 'wing' is more of a descriptive characteristic, as it describes the part of the body that makes up a bird. This is too general, and the answer provided should not be one of a specific piece of the body but something that includes the bird's name as well as its description.\n\nAnswer: D: bird\n\nInput: Wherever might a person say that he was going to the store? Choices: A: at mall B: at mall C: at mall I: at mall\nRationales: In the phrase \"go to the mall\", the word \"mall\" can be seen as a possible response. This is because malls, although they are not used by everyone, are stores in and of themselves. They are commercial locations in which vendors sell different items and goods. Also, malls are often associated or associated at least implicitly with other stores, which is why the term mall can be seen as a valid response.\n\nHowever, the answer is provided as \"at the mall\", which indicates that the person is describing a shopping mall, an establishment in which a variety of stores are housed. It should also be noted that the word \"at\" can be seen in different forms, such as \"at\" and \"in,\" each implying different kinds of locations or places where a person can say that he/she is going to the mall. The phrase \"at the mall\" provides more information about the specific kind of location, which is a mall as opposed to another type of store. Also, the", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

Choices: A: light bulb B: pencil C: lamp D: pen E: clock\nRationales: The question asks about a particular object which is a paradox.\n 1. The options listed here are all objects in this case\n 2. Since our question has the words 'PARADOX', only options (A) and (E) can be correct choices\n 3. Let us start with (A) lightbulb\n 4. The definition of light bulb is: 'A light that consists of an electric filament, often sealed in an evacuated glass bulb containing inert gas and served by an electric current to produce light'\n 5. As per the definition, the lightbulb is a solid object that is not a liquid and is incapable of causing motion\n 6. This rules out choice (A) lightbulbs from the list\n 7. Let us now analyse choice (E) the clock\n 8. The definition of clock is: 'an instrument for showing the time', as we know, a clock is not any ordinary instrument, it is something that is made in a complex fashion\n 9. Also, since a clock uses a pendulum or a gear wheel, it cannot just move at a fixed position i.e. it cannot be stationary. Thus, any paradox that can be present within a clock is a paradox that can also occur in the case of a lightbulb\n 10.

Choices A: an obligation of eating B: the aftereffects of eating C: appreciation for food D: the responsibilities given to one after a meal E: the unimportant consequences of eating\nRationales: This question asks about the example. We also have to consider antonyms. Since  'obligation' opposes  'appreciation' we need to exclude 'B'. \nSimilarly, 'obligation' also opposes'responsibility' so 'D' is not considered. \nWe can then eliminate 'E' as the wrong answer choice since it includes the term 'obligation'.\nThe keyword here is example and not antonyms so we can exclude 'C', which was the hardest part.\nThere is no evidence for 'A' being the right answer so we can exclude 'A'.\nNow our final two choices are, 'C', which is the antonym of the keyword (example). \nAnd, 'B', which is a synonym of the keyword or the opposite of the antonym.\nSince the synonym cannot be the answer, 'B' is correct.\nAnswer (B): 'antonym'\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.

Choices: 12: price tag 13: quality A: discontinued B: promotion C: marketing E: dissuading D: advertising F: deflation\nRationales: Price discounting occurs when a retailer offers lower prices as a promotional strategy or as a means to induce higher sales volume or a certain quantity purchase. \nWith a price discount, the customer will buy more items than what he may typically buy. \nSometimes, items may be priced higher than they are typically sold for as another form of discounting.\n\n1. The key to finding the correct choice is to determine what can make an item less appealing to potential customers.\n2. One thing that affects a customer's appeal of something is price, which is why the option 'price tag' is an incorrect choice. \nOther reasons an item can be less appealing to customers are quality, defacing, advertising, discontinued, marketing, etc.\n3. These can also serve as a means to promote the item and offer a discount because the customer will buy more of the item they perceive to be of lesser quality or discontinue. \nHowever, the question explicitly refers only to the latter option, so we can drop it.\n4. Advertising is a tool to promote an item, whereby the item could potentially be promoted at a higher rate and a price discount. \nHowever, we can discard this because it is a means of promotion, but it is also an item. \nThe question only mentions discouraging or dissuading.\n5. This implies either decreasing the price or increasing the number of people purchasing the item through promotion or discounting.\n6. Only two options satisfy this, discounting and promotion.\n7.

All of the other responses are not valid because they do not state the correct sequence of events.\n2. 'John had to change the train station' is not correct because if there were to be a valid answer in this statement, it would need to be 'John ran late at work'.\n3. 'Because John had a better morning' is not correct because 'John was late after having a terrible morning' doesn't indicate a chronological pattern of events in John's morning.\n4. 'Becuase John had to change his train ticket' is also incorrect because John changing his ticket does not indicate the correct sequence of events for his day.\n5.

It is said that the reason for this policy is to avoid drawing in bugs and to protect the book from food damage and stains.  None of these reasons would be a good reason to permit food lending to a person likely to eat it quickly because they would have no risk of stains to the book or attracting bugs.", "answer": "D: graduate"}

Choices  A: cold B: diarrhea C: flu D: malaria E: parotiditis\nRationales: All the words in this sentence are related to illness and have to do with fever and high body temperature.  The other words here are cold, diarrhea, flu, malaria, parotiditis, and sick.\n\nWe can easily eliminate the options A: cold B: flu and E: parotiditisis based on the other options.\n\nThe man looks pale in the question. Cold, fever, and high body temperature are not associated with paleness.\n\nFlu isn't a type of fever, it's the illness. When you have fever, you have flu, but that is not a common case where you say you have fever as a symptom of having flu.\n\nParotiditis is associated with the swelling of the parotid glands, which is an unrelated condition that results from inflammation. In the wording of the question, parotiditis is used as an adjective to describe the illness, not related to the cause of this illness.\n\nFrom the options, we can deduce the cause of the illness based on the other options the question lists.\n\nBased on the other options, we can eliminate C: flu and E: diarrhea because diarrhea is associated with loose stool which the man didn't have.\n\nIf the man was pale based on the question wording, it means that a possible cause could be malaria. In the question, they use D: malaria as another possibility based on the other options in the list.\n\nSo the choice is D: malaria, meaning that the man has malaria.\n\nAnswer: D: malaria\n\nInput: The horse was unshaken by the storm it was ridden in.

Swimming 5. E. Diving\nRationales: The question asks what the fish doing in the very deep pond. The pond was very, very, very deep.\nOptions:\n1. If the fish is doing crawling, he is most likely trying to swim up to the surface.\n2. This means he will need to use his fins as he does not have legs.\n3. Which indicates he is more likely trying to swim or jump out of the pond than crawl on the surface.\n4. Swimming and jumping are the only options that can make sense according to his circumstances.\n5. Fishes need water to breathe and they cannot survive outside of water.\n6. Fishes cannot fly or make use of wings, they are only good floaters.\n7. Diving is an action that human can do, a fish cannot actually dive as he does not have lungs to breathe underwater.\n8. Therefore, he is most likely swimming or jumping out of the pond in an attempt to save himself and survive.\n9. Option B jumps out of the pond. Fish cannot crawl, according to science, he can only swim, or jump out of the watery grave for survival.\n10. Therefore, the option B jumps out of pond.\nRationales for option (B) \"a fish jumps out of the very deep pond\":\n11. We have to understand the meaning of the word \"jump\", there are three senses of jumping according to the online Oxford Dictionary.\n12. The first sense of jumping refers to the \"action of leaving the ground and moving through the air\". This clearly refers to a jumping action and is the correct meaning to describe the action of the fish in the pond.\n13. Hence, the fish would jump out of the ponds as a form of escape due to the depth.\nInput: The rocket launch was what? Choices: A. A fizzle. B.", "answer": "D: somber"}

It is a person at the party Choices:  A : an unknown person B: a person in a red shirt C: anyone at the party D: the bartender E: the person in the blue shirt\nRationales:\n1.  The context is an actual place. Where there is a party, someone must be the shark at the party. \n2. The question asks who that person is. So, the answer will be that individual.\n3. To find the answer to the question, read the options, and see if the description fits one of the available options in accordance with the description given. If it does, that will fit the description of the shark. \n4. The options provided are: A: An unknown person, B: A person in a red shir, C: Anyone at the party, D: The bartender, E: The person in the blue shir.\n5. Consider both the questions and options, notice that the word \u201cThe\u201d is only in this question and not anywhere else. If \u201cThe\u201d is part of the question, the answer should be the singular noun that follows \u201cThe\u201d as part of the description: who is the person (singular noun) at the party?\n6. As the shark is the person at the party, The bartender cannot be the shark, as he is not at the party. The party is not described at all in the sentence. Hence, The bartender is excluded from the question. \n7. The party is described with the word \u201cIt\u201d. This makes the description of the party an attribute of something else; \n8. It is known that whoever is the shark at the ocean is in the party, which is defined by the word \u201cIt\u201d. \n9. Hence, \u201canyone at the party\u201d, whoever that person is, can only be the shark in the question. Since the person at the party is the shark, person in a red shoe is also the person at the party but not the shark as he/she is wearing a red shoe, hence the answer has to be, anyone", "answer": "B: research laboratory"}

Choices:  C: rusty A: clean B: filthy E: tarnished\nRationales:1. The car was \"shiny\", an indicator that it was in a relatively clean state.\n2. This could indicate that the car might have been in one of the following conditions, A, B, C, D, or E.\n3. The car was \"rusty\", an indication that it could also be \"filthy\" or \"dirty\", which doesn't seem to relate to the context of \"shiny\".\n4. We also know that \"filthy\" or A\"dirty\" indicates a less clean state than that of \"shiny\", not equivalent to it.\n5. We also know that option E: \"tarnished\" indicates the same relatively clean state as in the first statement of the question.\n6. Therefore the only logical options left are C: \"rusty\" and option E: \"tanned\".\nAnswer: E: tarnished (from the information provided in the question)\n\nInput: I heard a bird. It was what? Choices:A: red B: brown C: green D: yellow E: grey\nRationales: The bird was \"red\", indicating that it wasn't a \"brown\", \"green\", or \"yellow\" bird.\n7. Since the bird was \"red\", there was no need to continue with the process because there was sufficient information on the bird, which, in this case, was red.\nAnswer: C B: brown Choices:B: brown\n\nInput: I didn't like the book.

Please apply the learning you gain from the above questions to these problems.\n\nInput: The man was working on a farm, he was tending the animals. Where might the animals be? Choices: A: garden B: pasture C: building D: barn E: land\nRationales: A: 'garden' suggests that the location of the land where animals are kept is related to a garden. Hence, B: pasture is the correct answer as the animals are being tended in an open/outdoor space and far from any buildings.\n\nInput: At what time is it easiest to travel between countries? Choices: A. morning B. evening C. at night D. in the afternoon E. midday\nRationales: The text explains that during the afternoon, weather conditions are less predictable and airfares are typically higher (so traveling more difficult and expensive). Hence, B and C are wrong for these reasons. At night, D, no one should travel by airplane anyway for obvious reasons. So, E: midday it is.\n\nInput: Which car is likely to be an SUV? Choices: A) compact B) sports C) hybrid D) sedan E) pickup truck\nRationales: From context, the word 'likely' is meant to signal that the given options are likely choices. However, the options given are not directly related to SUVs. To find the correct choice, note that the car in the example that the author is likely talking about is small, not a sports car. And from context, we can assume that the car is a sedan or hybrid. Also, SUVs have a higher than average chance of being large cars, so if the car is more likely to be an SUW, we can eliminate choices B and C and narrow down our options.\n\nInput: Where would you expect to find a shoe store?

{"text": "ability to do so.\n7. Therefore the most viable option is Tree.\nAnswer: E:: Tree\n\nInput: How do sharks make their children? Choices: \t A: Bred \t B: give birth\t  C: hatch\t\tD: raise\tE: protect\nRationales:\t1. The question asks for how sharks create offspring.\n2. One common way sharks have young is through the process of giving birth (B) as babies develop while the mother is pregnant inside her and not from having young after mating which is what we will refer to as \"hatching\".\n3. Although we can rule out option \"A: Bred\", the other options don't necessarily indicate the same thing.\n4. Thus we can exclude \"C: hatch\" because a baby developing inside a pregnant mother is not an immediate \"hatching\" of the offspring, which might be implied if the sentence structure emphasized on the idea of a mother getting pregnant after mating.\n5. Hence, of the three viable answers remaining which are B: give birth, D: raise, and E: protect.\n6. We can exclude option \"D: raise\" because raising implies the nurturing of young that have already been born.\n7. This leaves us with option \"B: give birth\" and option \"E: Protect\", both of which can refer to the process of giving birth.\n8. Since it is unlikely that the baby is protected from the mother during the process of creating it via giving birth, option D: protect is the most viable answer because it aligns with the process of giving birth rather than the result.\n9. Therefore, the correct answer is B: give birth.\nAnswer: D:: Protect\n\nInput: Where did the fire escape from?

Choices:  Tesco A M\u00fasica B Musicland C Music Centre D Music store E Music shop\nRationales:  1. The problem statement says \"where.. could I pick one up.\" Therefore, we are looking to buy an instrument.\n2. Instruments can only be found in a music store.\n3. Tesco and M\u00fasica do not sell, nor do they even have instruments. \n4. Musicland and Music Centre sell many instruments, but they are mainly electronics stores that do not sell musical instruments.\n5. Music Store is a place that sells musical instruments, just like a music shop. Therefore, it's the answer.\nAnswer: D - Music store\n\nInput: Which of the following is a type of food served at a sit down restaurant: steak, pasta, french toast, eggs, or pancakes? Choices: 1. steak 2. pasta 3. french toast 4. eggs 5. pancakes Rationales: 1 - Firstly, we are given which foods are served at sit down restaurants. We can rule out steak and eggs. Steak is usually considered fast food and eggs are usually considered a snack, not a main course.\n2 - Secondly, we are given a list of possible foods in the question. They are steak, pasta and pancakes. Now we look at the options: A - is not a sit down restaurant, B - is not a food.\n3 - Again we look at the options. A - is not a food but a dish made of food. B - is not a dish made of 2 ingredients at all, it's a dish made of three ingredients. So, C is the right answer.\n4 - French toast is a type of breakfast food. Breakfast dishes are foods that are usually considered snacks.\n5 - Lastly, eggs and pancakes are foods you find at a sit down restaurant.\nAnswer: C - French toast\n\nInput: Which item has many legs?

The question is focusing on a type of animal that uses a \"mating call\", which is a sound produced through body sounds or vocalizations that signal the presence of an adult animal.\n2. We can eliminate option E: fox because it refers to \"mating call\" as in the call of a fox as opposed to the fox itself. \n3. We can eliminate option D: gorilla because gorillas are larger animals, so the \"mating\" term here refers to the process of breeding gorillas. \n4. Option F: gorilla is a poor choice because it is an animal. The question doesn't ask which type of animal uses a mating sound, but we can infer from the question that only an animal with sound capabilities can respond.\n5. Option A can't be ruled out because dolphins can make sounds, but the question indicates mating \"calls\" as opposed to pure sounds.\n6. The only choice left is option C: squirrel.\nAnswer: C : squirrel\n\nInput: We call the group, those who have what in common? Choices:  C: eye color B: religion D: nationality A: gender E: age\nRationales: The key to this question is to find the thing each of the given choices have in common to form the group.\n1. Since the group we're asking about has something in common, the options that do not contain this word will not be applicable.\n2. Therefore, we can eliminate options E: age and A: gender.\n3. This leaves options B: religion D: nationality, and C: eye color.\n4. While these are all groups, they are diverse. We must find a common thing they have that can be used to draw the group together.\n5. This is the factor that all people in this group share of having \"eye color\" in common.\n6. Thus the correct answer is C: eye color. \nAnswer: C: eye color\n\nInput: What was the result of the election? Choices:  D", "answer": "D: knowingly"}

Choices: A: both regions use cow's milk B: both regions use goat's milk C: both regions use sheep's milk D: both regions use other milk E: many regions in the world use many milks\nRationales: It's important to first note that the store probably had a small variety of cheeses from both areas.\n1. Analyzing the statements in the problem, it's clear that \"both\" refers to Italy and Holland.\n2. This leads us to answer options 'A' and 'C': Holland uses goat's milk and Italy uses sheep's milk.\n3. Furthermore, the context of the statement indicates that the store had multiple types of cheese from both these regions/countries.\n4. There cannot be multiple types of cheese in both regions if they do not use different kinds of animal milk because there will be no difference between the cheese made from them.\n5. Therefore the only viable options remaining are 'A' and 'B' as they refer to goat's milk coming from Italy. Both 'A' and 'D' are false because Italy does not use sheep's milk and goat's milk in their cheese. Similarly, option 'B' is true.\n6. Thus 'B' is the correct answer suggesting that both regions use goat milk.\nAnswer: B.

The question pertains to a vehicle towing a car, such as an \"A: car\" or tow truck or \"C: parking lot\".\n2. This makes Option 3, \"C: parking,\" the best answer because cars are often left abandoned or damaged and sometimes broken in the parking lot.\n3. Option D, \"parking garage,\" doesn't quite apply because the cars are too well kept and would not be damaged or abandoned.\n4. Option F, \"police station,\" also doesn't work because cars left in police stations were usually there by the order of the law. They were not usually damaged, abandoned or broken.\n5. In conclusion, the most suitable answer is \"C: parking\" and \"B: tow truck.\"\nAnswer: C: parking, B: tow trough\n\nInput: The most difficult position in tennis must be the what? Choices: A: baseline B: court C: backhand D: singles E: net\nRationales: There are many terms in the English language used for describing a specific location on a tennis court. Some are interchangeable. However, others are unique to particular positions on the tennis court and cannot be used interchangeably. \n1. When examining the phrase \"most difficult position,\" we can infer that the question is looking for the location that is difficult on a tennis court, i.e. the position involving the most difficulty.\n2. We can exclude options A, B, and E as these all refer to other characteristics of the tennis court that are not relevant and which the phrase \"most difficult positions\" does not relate to. As such, these options are incorrect answers.\n3. To analyze the other remaining options more carefully we need to understand how court is used in the context and to ascertain whether it is used to describe the surface of the stadium or the location where players play the game.", "answer": "C: entertain"}

Choices:  food B: a carrot C: meat D: corn E: a hamburger\nRationales: We are presented evidence in two statements: The dog was large and had a huge hunger. What food does the dog need to be fed with?\n1. \"large\" and \"huge hunger\". The first statement states the dog is large and is not an action or something the dog does. As such, the large dog isn't eating the food by itself. This action should happen, for example, the owner of the dog would feed the dog or pass by its bowl and put food into it. Therefore, the food is in the dog bowl, not consumed by the dog.\n2. The second statement has an action: \"eats\". So we can infer that the food is still in the dog bowl and not already in the dog belly.\n3. Therefore, we look at the available options. We don't have information about the type of food, but a dog being large can't suggest it's only \"carrot\" or \"meat\". The food being large and the dog having a huge hunger can mean the dog consuming almost any food of the dog's choice or at least of the owner's choice. It can't be \"corn\" or \"a hamburger\" as these foods are too big for a large dog to eat in a single sitting. \n4. Therefore, the options available are \"food\" and \"meat\", while the others are not suitable. The dog does not need to be fed a specific food. It needs to be fed food in general.\n5. The other options that are excluded are \"A: corn\" because the dog eats the corn. \"D: hamburger\" seems impossible for a big dog to eat in a sitting.\n6. So the best answer is B: \"food\" because the question asks about the action that the owner should do, not what the dog consumes.\nAnswer: A : food\n\nInput: The teacher took a look at a student who was always misbehaving.

Basement: The question refers to a'mouse', which generally uses a home as its dwelling, or a place where it tends to hide or be found. 2. Home: The question refers to 'home', or a property that has a kitchen, a bedroom, and other aspects of living and residing. Some of these could be found inside basements. 3. Ground: Mice, like many other small creatures, seek to avoid being spotted and hunted by predators. In order to prevent being disturbed, they prefer to stay under or near the ground. 4.

Firstly, you need to have an amazing business idea, which has never been done before. If you have an amazing business that other people want to do, they will not be able to do it because there own business idea is not original. Secondly, you need to create a business plan. If you have an original amazing business, you must use it to create a business plan, because you needs to know where are they going to work and how are they going to do it. Thirdly, you need customers and employees. You do not need just a good service but a good service with good, well-motivated employees that people want to recommend to other people, for example, coffee shops. Fourthly, you need finance. When you have a company, you need capital to open and run a shop and to have investors, because companies that are public do not have investors, but they have capital from the people who buy their shares. The last thing you need is a license to make your business legal. If your business is illegal then it is like playing a roulette, because you can win everything while playing or you could lose everything. As a conclusion", "answer": "D: wires"}

Choices: A: the answer to her math exam B: her homework C: homework D: the book she was reading E: the fact that the dog chewed her math book\nRationales:1. The question implies that the girl has forgotten something significant to her.\n2. 'Forgotten' usually refers to things that were previously possessed and were then forgotten or lost.\n3. Therefore, the options should identify something that could have been (and for a period was) possessed or held.\n4. Option 'A: the answer to her Math exam' clearly cannot be a thing that was previously held, because as an answer to an exam it's simply a concept or thought in her head.\n5. 'B. her homework', 'D. the book she was reading', 'C. homework', and 'E. the fact that the dog chomped her math book' are not viable options because they don't imply the possession of an object that's been lost or forgotten.\n6. Therefore the correct answer is E: the fact that dog chewed her mathbook.", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

Choices:  B: the child is not left handed. C: they use their right hand to dominate. D: they're ambidextrous\nE: their left brain function. F: they dominate both with their right hand and their left hand.\nRationales: From looking at the prompt, it's evident that the answer has something to do with either 'A: the child is left handed' or 'C: they use their right'.\n1. Since none of the answers given are incorrect, it implies the correct answer should be one that is the opposite of the given incorrect options. \n2. Answer: The child is left handed.\n\nInput: If someone says he's a left-handed, you might describe them as what? Choices: B: ambidextrous C: right handed D: southpaw\nRationales: The question is asking what we should call someone if they say they're a left-handed.\nAnalysis: Left handed = Southpaw - The phrase refers to someone who uses their left hand more often than their right one.\n1. As a matter of definition, calling someone southpaw implies they are actually southpaw. \n2. If someone says they're a southpaw, then this person would be either Ambidextrous or Right handed.\n3. Answer: B: ambidexterous\n\nInput: I think we should have a picnic! Where shall we go? Choices:  C: jungle E: beach\nRationales: It is asking where should we go for the picnic.\nAnalysis: We look at the word \"Picnic\" to get an idea of what it entails, what's typically done while at a picnic?\na) You get out of doors.\nb) Going on with adventure\n\nNow that we understand what a picnic entails, we look at all the options for where one can go to have their picnic.\n- Jungles is known to be an adventurous place but not very suitable to a picnic.\n- Beach is a place where people like to go or have picnics", "answer": "E: england"}

Choices: A: food B: clothes C: books D: a car E: a computer\nRationales: Firstly, we can see that the statement \"He's bought what?\" does not make sense as it is a short sentence with the lack of a noun or an identification of the thing he bought.\nSecondly, \"The man has a lot of\" money implies the sentence is describing the status relating to this money he has. \nThirdly, since the sentence is asking us to answer, \"The man has bought what?\" then we know it is related to the money he is mentioning.\nFourthly, from the available choices, the choices \"Food\" and \"Books\" are irrelevant as the man is mentioning about money. Also, \"Clothes\" is a human-related thing and it wouldn't buy them.\nFifthly, for the choice \"A car\", if the man made a lot of money, then it would not be correct, or it would be wrong because of the time of buying a car would be longer ago than the time of buying the food.\nLastly, the sentence is asking about money, so the answer should related to the money since money is the thing the sentence is asking us about.\n\nAnswer: B: clothes\n\nInput: What would be a good way to help yourself finish a difficult task? Choices: A B C D\nRationales: The choice \"A good way\" implies that there is a \"way\". Also, it has three answers because the writer is asking us to choose one of the answer.\nIn this question, the answer can be related to the other answer like A can be related to B or C, which makes B as the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: A:\n\nInput: Where is the city of Lusaka found? Choices: A.

Choices:  E: tree  A: air  B: roof  D: sky  C: water\nRationales:1. The question is about the location in which a hawk is most likely to fly.\n2. The question uses the word 'likely'. Since people use this term to express something they believe is plausible, we can infer the assumption that a hawk actually is flying at the places indicated but this is subjective.\n3. Consideration of the choices yields the understanding that a hawk should be flying above the earth, and thus, in the sky or in the clouds.\n4. Therefore, because a hawk can be seen in clouds or in the sky, the options to choose are 'D: sky' and 'C: water'.\n5. However, the sky can be reached on a roof or in-between trees, so 'D: sky', 'B: roof', and 'E: tree' are all plausible answers. This would apply in situations where the hawk has no freedom to fly the way it needs to.\n6. Thus the most appropriate response among these options would be 'C: water'. Since hawks fly above the earth, water is the only place on the planet where you can truly reach the sky.\nAnswer: C, C: water\n\n---\n\u00a9 2020 Trilogy Education Services, a 2U, Inc. brand.

{"text": "ability to climb upwards using its hands.\n7. Therefore the answer is E:tree.\nAnswer: E, tree\n\n### Explanation:\n\n### The machine was very intricatc\n\nIn the sentence 'The machine was very intricate', the correct context would help in analyzing what the word 'intricate' means.\n\nThis is because in this context, the person may have meant something different from the common definition of 'intricate'.  Therefore, we have to analyze the sentence with the context in mind so that we can narrow down our answer options.\n\nFocusing on the sentence context, we notice that the sentence is describing a machine.\n\nMachines are used for various purposes and some of these are quite complex. \n\nFor example a car is a machine, and it's quite intricate in nature. \n\nThe description of the machine makes it seem like it has many complex parts. This is why it is being described as 'intricate' as in it is complex. That is why we have to apply the principles of elimination to narrow down our options.\n\n### B: apparatus\nThis option is closer to our idea for what 'intricate' is, so let's compare this against the other options to find out which is the right answer.\n\nA: 'box' or 'apparatus'.\n\nThis word does not convey the idea of intricacy or complexity at all. While this option does have many parts, it can only be used for reference in household environments, whereas our scenario needs it to be in an industrial context.\n\nB: 'apparatus' - 75%\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this option makes our analysis fall in place, and can be applied due to the fact that it falls in line with a lot of the information. \n\nThis means that this is a higher-quality answer because it fits in well.\n\nC: 'car' - 74%\n\nIn this case, though it does fall into our criteria as being a word for a vehicle, it should not be considered since the person already gave us the answer'machiene' and it makes no sense for the word to be car.\n\nD: 'appliance' - 67%\n\nAgain in this case, this falls under the category of household terms and items.", "answer": "A: curiosity"}

They all noticed she had which characteristic? Choices: 1. kind A: kind B: good C: honest D: nice E: thoughtful\nRationales:1. It\u2019s evident the employee is making efforts to please her co-workers and boss through her efforts to befriend them.\n2. We can infer that she made herself attractive to them. If co-workers and ones\u2019s boss notice a good characteristic in an employee, it would need to be an obvious one.\n3. In other words, the characteristic must be positive and noticeable, which we can confirm here.\n4. Moreover, the answer choices are listed under the category of personality traits, suggesting they should refer to a positive quality of a person.\n5. The choices are 1. kind, 2. good, 3. honest, 4. nice, and 5. thoughtful.\n6. If we eliminate the incorrect options such as 1. kind, we are left with 2. good, which refers to something positive about the employee.\n7. For that reason, we select 2. good.\n\nAnswer: B: nice\n\nInput: If an employee has a personality that is described as being disobedient, what is this person? Choices:  C: dislikable D: undisciplined E: rude F: undependable G: rebellious\nRationales:\n1. Firstly, we can tell the employee's personality is not nice or pleasant.\n2. Then, we know the employee's person will have a personality trait that is undesirable.\n3. Finally, we can infer that the employee's person is not good in character, such as being nice or pleasant.\n4. After taking all these things into consideration, the only option that fits our description is 2. dislikable.\n\nAnswer: C: dislikable\n\nInput: The boy who stole money was seen by the teacher and given what?

When Frank walked from the taxi, his shoes got very soaked. Where was Frank? Choices:  a: outside b: restaurant c: shoe store d: bar e: airport\nRationales: (a) Frank walked from taxi to bar (to get a drink and food); (b) he was in restaurant (with a taxi driver); (c), he was probably not in a shoe store as he got his shoes soaked. (d) bar (he was in); (b) restaurant (he was in). Answer: D: bar\n\nInput: The chef put the dish ____ the top of the oven. Choices:  A. from B. into C. onto D. over\nRationales: The direction we put something in, on, or into, is 'into' for something that 'falls into' the location we are describing as the 'location that is being mentioned'; 'on' means 'to put on top of something, i.e. something that gets 'put onto' the object; and 'from' or 'on' means'something to move from' or'move from'\n\nRationale: An object, 'falls into' or is 'put onto' or'moves from' a location. 'On top' is not a direction nor is something 'on' or 'onto' itself. Dish is 'put onto' the oven. Oven does not 'put an object onto itself'. Hence, A, 'into B, 'on C, 'from D, 'on onto an object. Answer: D: 'On'\n\nInput: What direction is _____ headed? Choices: A. going B. facing C. turning D. walking\nRationales: An object'moves', not'moves itself'. If the direction is toward the location, then something is'moving' toward that location. Answer: A. 'Going'\n\nRationale 1: 'Going' is a direction (i.e. 'direction' would be toward or away from something and 'go' is movement toward, away from); 'going' means a direction is 'toward' something.

Choices:  I: well water. II. pond water. III. tap water. IV. rain water. V. lake water\nRationales: The given choices all describe different kinds of water and we need to determine if they correspond to where a frog may drink water. \n1. The question asks us what a frog would usually drink from. In order to determine this, we can account for the potential presence of the frog, what's available to the frog that'd be considered a beverage, and whether that beverage is likely to be ingested by the frog.\n2. The choices we are given are:\n     - well water.\n     - pond water.\n     - tap water.\n     - rain water.\n     - lake water.\n3. Option 'I: well water' is not an example of something easily ingested by a frog. It seems pretty clear that wells are not suitable places for a frog to drink. In contrast, pond water, tap water, and rain water, although all water sources, are relatively easier to ingest by the frog in comparison to well water.\n4. Option 'IV: lake water' refers to bodies of water larger than ponds or lakes but less than oceans or seas. Since 'p' sounds like 'f' in some English dialects and because the question specifically refers to what a frog might do, it's more likely that we are dealing with 'pond water' or 'rain water'.", "answer": "D: staying there"}

Choices: A: cram B: study C: memorize D: cheat E: prepare\nRationales:1. The question is about a teacher asking her students to \"crash or study... test sheets\".\n2. \"Study sheets\" are test papers given to students prior to taking the test.\n3. We can rule out option D: \"memorize\" because the question asks us to determine what the students were asked to do with the \"test sheets,\" not to \"memorize\" the sheets.\n4. Option \"study\" does not apply because \"memorize\" and \"study\" are synonyms, and synonyms cannot both be used.\n5. Therefore we are down to options A: \"Cram\" and B: \"prepare\".\n6. Cramming would indicate that students were asked to \"stuff\" something into their brains without taking time to adequately study and understand what is being filled in their minds. However, we have been specifically asked to pick what the teacher asked the students to do.\n7. This implies that \"study\" is the correct answer. The teacher did not tell students to \"ram\" or \"shove\" things into their brains. They asked them to \"study\" the notes.\n8.

'They' refers to the 'wherever'.\n2. According to our knowledge of 'wherever', 'wherever' is not found where it is hot nor in water, dry locations.\n3. Therefore, the most fitting option is D: northwest because 'nor are they in water'.\n4. This is because 'hot' refers to the tropical climate in the northwest.\n5.

Choices:  A. reel B. tackle C. rod D. lure E. bait\nRationales: - 1. The question asks where fishermen set their hooks. - 2. The first step in determining the correct answer is to identify and account for the \"many skills\" that fishermen rely on.\n    - 3. Some keywords are specific to this question. The first one is \"where\" the hooks are being set. Looking down from above, it\n        seems clear that \"where\" is referring to a location or place.\n    - 4. Another keyword is \"hooks\". The context shows fishermen setting fishing hooks in some place. Fishing hooks are objects that are commonly attached to things, such as fishing rods. Thus,\n        we can infer that the answer is related to a place where fishing hooks can be set.\n    - 5. Looking at the choice that has the word \"hook\" can potentially make it more likely to be the correct answer choice.\n        - 6. There are four answers that do not include the word \"hook\", but we can eliminate choices B, C, and D since they are not locations.\n            - 7. Answer choice B is a mechanical device. It is neither a location nor place-like. Answer choice C is a type of equipment but is not similar to what is used in fishing. This is another answer choice that is not a location or place-like. Finally, choice D is neither a location nor a place-like.\n        - 8. The remaining choice for the correct answer is choice E, which is a place-like. - 9.

B: Of course A: Yes D: No E: I don't know F: Yes\nRationales:. 1. The question asks whether these pests can see darkness when the light bulbs are off.\n2. Options 'I don't know' and 'No' could imply the absence of light in absolute, but pests probably have been drawn to light and are now in the dark. They can still see enough light.\n3. This eliminates 'I don't Know' and 'No'.\n4. Both 'Yes' and 'Of course' answer 'Can pests see darkness when the lightbulbs are off?' with a positive. This would make our conclusion that pests can see enough light to be attracted.\n5. Finally, 'F: Yes' is the same as 'Of course'; therefore only one answer can be accepted.\n6.

So we can exclude the options as: A: book store; B: store and D: university.\n4. The other locations which usually sell books for leisure or for study are the book stores, libraries, museums, and grocery stores.\n5. So, we can choose the remaining options as:\na. C: book shop\nb. W: library\nc. B: museum\n6. Hence, the answer will be:\n7. W: library\nAnswer:\nW: library\n\nInput: She had a squeaky wheel, where on the bike was it? Choices:  T: handle bars D: wheels A: pedals B: seat E: brakes\nRationales:\n1. She had a squeaking wheel. This tells us from the context that squeaking noise is originating from someplace on the bike.\n2. After looking at the choices, we can rule out \"handle bars\" as it is something which is fixed and not movable so it can't be making squeaking noises.\n3. Similarly, we cannot find a squeaking wheel on the \"bike,\" either, as the bike isn't referred to in any way in the question, but just the bike.\n4. Next we can rule out \"seat\".\n5.

Choices:  B: jungle C: zoo D: pond E: town\n\nRationales:\n1. The word \u201cour yard\u201d in the statement indicates that the person has a backyard.\n2. Since the person already saw a fox in their backyard, we can assume that they have one or more fox in their yard.\n3. \u201cWe will be looking for a pet\u201d means that the person is looking for where they can buy another fox as a pet.\n4. We know that people keep foxes in yards, jungles, zoos, ponds, and towns.\n5. Comparing all the options, Zoos are not suitable places to look for foxes because they contain other animals. Other animals should not have foxes as a pet.\n6. People do not keep foxes in the jungle so it is not suitable and is also unlikely to be the kind of place where we can look for foxes.\n7. Similarly, neither do people keep foxes in ponds or towns.\n8. Since foxes are kept in people\u2019s yards and not ponds or town, people will look for a fox in a yard-like environment.\n9. Hence, the most likely place where we can look to find another fox is in a yard like our backyard.\n\nFox\nInput: I saw three monkeys in the forest. They looked exactly the same as each other.

Monkeys cannot play hide-and-seck. \u2018Outside\u2019 is wrong because the monkeys looked identical. It is unlikely that this one monkey can be the other two.\n\n2.\u2019Fighting\u2019 is a word choice. Because the", "answer": "A: come home"}

Where could it have been purchased, if not necessarily from a shop? Choices:  Rationales: 1.[A] The vase could have been purchased from any place other than a shop, in other words, it could have been gifted or received from someone. This does not necessarily require it to be bought.\n2. [B] The vase could not have been purchased from any other place, except for a shop.\n3. [C] The vase could've been purchased at a shop but that does not guarantee we know who made it. There could be many places that have been selling the vase.\n4.[D] The vase may have been purchased at a local craft vendor that makes or sells objects and that typically are in a shop-like setting like a market.\n5. [E] The vase could be a handmade item not made necessarily by anyone in particular.\n\nA's answer is clearly not correct as bought implies there is some type of transaction and only shopping malls are shopping.\n\nB's answer is not correct either because it doesn't take into account the vase found on a desk, it assumes the vase was found anywhere.\n\nC's answer doesn't make any sense at all.\n\nD's answer is clearly the correct one as it takes into account the vase was found and that it may be a local craft vendor which is clearly a shop-like arrangement.\n\nE's answer is definitely the one as the vase may have been handmade by the owner or the owner of a local craftsman.\n\nThis seems like an awful exam question.

What are the two most important things a passenger should know? Choices: 1. A: What language the airport employees speak. 2. B: The phone numbers of the people you are meeting. 3. C: How customs at the airport operates. 4. D: How to get from the plane to a local shuttle. 5. E: How to purchase a local SIM Card.\nRationales: The question asks about two things a passenger should know when traveling by jet to an unfamiliar country that they haven't been to before.\n\n1. In the situation, the passengers' objective is to get to a shuttle or a bus from the plane, which the airport may not be familiar with. Therefore, the passengers would need to know how to get from the plane and local shuttle or bus, which is why choice 'D: how to get from the airplane to a local shuttles' should be the correct answer.\n\n2. Choice 'C: how customs at the airports operates' is also viable because customs is involved in both travel and shuttling from the airport to their final destination; although, it does not describe how to get from plane to shuttles or bus, which is a very important thing to know for travel.\n\n3. Choice 'B: the phone number of the people they are meeting and to help determine which customs line to get in at the airport, it might not be essential for the passenger to know these numbers at hand.\n\n4. Choice 'A: what languages the airport emplyees speak'is a nice way to describe the importance of being able to communicate in the local language, but, it is a bit too indirect to be correct. \n\n5.

When we analyze the given options, we find that 'elephant' fits best. However, it's not the best choice as it's a giant mammal found on land, water, and sky.\n\nTherefore, the answer is choice E: hipppomotomus. -\n\nRationales:  2. A 'hypopotamus' (spelling error) is a giant mammal that lives only on land, not the sky.\n3. Therefore, it fits the criteria of the statement.\n\nAnswer: E: hippopomotamus\n\nInput: Which vegetable is used to make kimchi? Choices:  D: cabbage E: cauliflower F: kale G: daikon\nRationales: All the given choices are types of vegetables that have been used to make kimchis.\n1.

Choices:  Fruits:  A: mango B: peach C: apple D: plum E: banana\nChoices for shapes:  Shapes:  A: circle B: oval C: triangle D: rectangle E: square F: ellipse G: pentagon\nRationales: For the 'fruit':  Shapes: for the fruit, we're looking for words that are synonyms to 'round', which means not having sharp corners and edges.\n1. Mango, peach, and Apple are all round fruits. A Mango is round, a peach is round, and an apple is round.\n2. Banana is elongated in shape and plum is teardrop shaped.\n3. Plum is also not round, since it is shaped like a teardrop.\n4. A mango, peach, or apple is round, so the answer is 'D: round'.\n5. Now for the Shapes.\n6. The options are Triangle, Circle, Oval, Rectangle, Square, and Pentagon.\n7. A triangle has sharp corners, circle is round, oval is curved, rectangle and square are flat, and pentagon has sharp angles.\n8. Circle, Triangle, and Oval are not round. So that narrows our options to: 'D: Square' and 'E: Circle'.\n9. Since triangle, oval, and circle are not round, and square is circular, we can rule out all of these as possible answers for the question.\n10. Only circle and square are both round, so the answer can be E: circle.\nAnswer: Circle\n\nInput: Why might you use a brush with tiny bristles?

Choices: A: skilled B: good C: experienced D: young E: young\nRationales:  1. The question statement refers to a jockey who recently won her first horse race.\n2. The question asks about the father of this jockey's opinion regarding her daughter's victory.\n3. This is also a clue towards understanding what the answer has to do with the context.\n4. Thinking of words that refer to the winning daughter, we see that'skilled', 'good' and 'experienced' are likely candidates depending on how we define any of those terms.\n5. However, one word missing from this list is 'young'.\n6. Analyzing the question's context, it states that the horse race was won by 'a new jockey' (someone who has never won a race before).\n7. This gives us a strong inclination towards inferring the answer 'young' which fits well to the context.\n8. Therefore, we can infer that the answer is E: young.\nAnswer: E young\n\nInput: The speaker said that he'd had bad breath before, he added that he's likely to have this because of what? Choices -A: infection B: infections C: influx D: imbalance E: disease\nRationales:   1. The question revolved around a speaker who made a remark about infections and related it to having bad smell.\n2. In the given choices, we can see the words that pertain to 'influx' or 'imbalance' because they refer to something that could be causing an infection.\n3. However 'A' pertains to 'infection' which gives us a clearer view of what we should be looking for.\n4. As stated by the speaker, infections may cause bad breath. So among the given options, only 'A: infection' is applicable.\n5. Therefore we should infer that the answer to the question is B: infections\nAnswer: B: infections.\n\nInput: The man", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

The sultan's birthdate is not a holiday. 3. The event is not observed around a table. 4. The city was a small country. 5. The event is not an annual event.\nRationales:\n1. The description is of the sultan's celebration. This is what's being asked about so the question is not about the city.\n2. In order to choose a birthday or anniversary celebration, we need to know the birthdate or anniversary of who or what is being celebrated.\n3. We know the celebration is for a sultan as the question phrases it \"sultan's birthday\", so it's likely that the celebration is a ruler's birthday.\n4. For rulers, most birthdays are observed in annual occasions or events. The celebration's duration refers to when the festivities are held, not how long the festivities last.\n5. A birthday/anniversary is often celebrated around a table.\n6. A city is a town or region, while a country is a political or sovereign region. The options are suggesting the country is too large to be of a small nature.\n7. In the final analysis, we're picking ruler's birthdate/anniversary because it most fits the characteristics of a birthday/anniversaries in a yearly sense.\nAnswer: 3\n\nInput: Why isn't the sultan's name given? Choices: 0. Name doesn't match place. 1. Birthday is small. 2. The event is not too often held. 3. Birthdays are a yearly event. 4. The event is not big.\nRationales and Explanation:\n1. The options are describing the context of why a ruler's name isn't given.\n2.

He had walked on too many of what? Choices  A: paved roads B: grass fields C: wooden piers D: concrete sidepaths E: brick walkways\nRationales: Considering the statement above, the answer choice must be related to a mode of transportation.\n1. Paved roads - A, B, and C are all types of roads/path that may vary in terms of surface material. They are all concrete-based and therefore cannot be called a \"walk\". Paved roads - A and D are also concrete-based and would therefore not be suitable as a type of walkway that may be used by the tourist who \"has walked on too many\". Grass fields - B and C are likely fields, which could have grass growing naturally - but they may be used for other purposes rather than to be called a \"walkway\". There are many other options, but they cannot be categorized in terms of concreteness, therefore cannot be a suitable walking area.\n2. Wooden piers - D is incorrect because wooden piers do not refer to a walk way, but rather a structure (such as a bridge or pier).\n3. Brick walkways - E is incorrect, as a brick walkway would be a more decorative or permanent type of walkway. Additionally, brick walkways usually cannot be navigated by tourists - in other words, most tourists will avoid brick walkways because of the difficulty of walking on them.\n4. Concrete sidepaths - C, the remaining answer choice, would fall into the category of \"walkway\" because it is both made from concrete (meaning it is \"concrete-based\") and has a very specific pathway.

Choices:  B: wide hat C: big umbrella D: small umbrella\nRationales: Looking at the given options, we have to determine which one is a better protection when the sun is too warm: a wide hat or a small umbrella.\n1. The question asks about when a wide hat or a big umbrella would be better; therefore, any of the available options could be suitable under the circumstances.\n2. While 'A: small umbrella' looks like a logical answer choice, it doesn't make sense when considering the given context. Since a sun umbrella is generally much smaller than big umbrellas, it wouldn't be adequate protection against the sun.\n3. 'C: big umbrella' seems like a better choice according to the given question. For the same reason as 'A:' small umbrella, the size makes a 'B: wide hat' a more logical alternative.\n4. There is, however, an additional contextual requirement for this to be the case. The umbrella needs to be big enough such that its shade reaches everywhere one needs to have protection, including the head. Therefore, 'big umbrella' can work if it is of large enough size.\n5. This doesn't quite make sense for an 'A: small um brella.' For this option, the umbrella needs to cover the whole body, which wouldn't necessarily work for the head.\n6. However, a 'B: wide' hat can shield the head adequately from even small sized umbrellas.\n7. Thus the best answer would be 'B: wide hat'.\nAnswer: B: wide hat", "answer": "A: landscape"}

So, we can rule out Orange and Lemon from the given list. Both Lemon and Orange are fruit that have been grown from seed. Pineapple is the only fruit which is grown from a flower. So, we can eliminate B and C from the list. Now, we are left with the list to decide which fruit we should choose? A) Orange,  or B) Lemon, or C) Pineapple Now, let's read it again. Orange is the most acid fruit of all, and Pineapple is the fruit that is grown from a flower, while Lemon is grown from a seed.

The question asks for a place where a dog may be found while looking for a home.\n2. All the other options listed are places where dogs usually stay.\n3. They don't represent places where the dog is on the hunt to find a home. \n4. In conclusion, if a dog wants to find a new home, he'll be outdoors. So, the answer choice is A.\nAnswer: A. outdoors\n\nInput: Where is a large group of ducks likely to be found?\nChoices: A. On large water bodies B. On small water bodies C.

Choices: A: work B: drink C: count sheep D: talk in your sleep E: breathe\nRationales: The question asks which among the options can be done to keep someone awake at night.\nThis question asks about activities to prevent or ward off sleepiness at night, which is the opposite of what'sleeping' refers to.\n1. There are some choices that are not feasible or unlikely for keeping someone from sleeping at night, especially while conscious.\n2. Activities involving drinking, counting sheep, and working are all things people would do while aware and conscious.\n3. As such, choosing any of them means that you are not actually 'awake' at night, rather conscious while trying to stay awake.\n4. Therefore, the only choice that prevents sleep is 'breathe', since breathing is necessary even when you are aware and trying to stay awake at night.  \n5. Additionally, this choice is a general action humans require at all times, so even if you were to accidentally fall asleep, it would still be a possibility that this action would cause you to wake up.\nAnswer: A. Breathe\n\nInput: The doctor's research indicates the effects of smoking and how long they last. What did the doctor try to conclude.

The question asks for the conclusion he came to.\n1. The question indicates that research was conducted regarding the effects of smoking on how long they last.\n2. The doctor's conclusion, as a researcher is either A: smoking is harmful to your health B: that smoking causes harm to your health or C: that smoking does not harm people's health.\n3. Answer choice B, which is the conclusion itself does not mention the timeframe or how long smoking causes effects on your health or body. Since that is a key point in the research, this leads us to answer choice C.\n4. As such, the", "answer": "A: sit down"}

A: locus 2. B: beetle 3. C: grub 4. D: worm\nRationales:\n1. The statement \"about insects\" refers to insects in general.\n2. However, this can be confusing because the words \"insects\" would also refer to the insects in the examination question.\n3. An \"examination question\" usually refers to the question(s) asked in the examination paper. \n4. Therefore, what we can be sure of is that all the five answers pertain to the question(s), which refers to insects.\n5. So, the question can be rephrased as, 'To do well in an exam, identify the correct name out the options given below...'. We can conclude that all the five options refer to the answer in the question.\n6. Since all the five options refer only to insects, we can infer that insects constitute the question in the examination paper, which makes it easier to identify a suitable answer from A, B, C, D, or E.\n7. While the options can refer to different types of insects, they can also be interchangeable as the option is only about the correct name.\n8. Thus, there aren't any specific physical characteristics to be concerned about as far as the insects are concerned.\n9. A 'beetle' is a specific type of insect which can be called a worm, grub, and so on.\n10. C: grub and D: worm are two types of insects that can be mistaken for 'beetles'. \n11.

The question is about a lorry moving from point A to point B.\n2. It asks where that lorry will stop if possible.\n3. The roadway, parking lot, and shopping area are areas that someone taking a lorry would stop to avoid causing an incident while driving.\n4. Parking lots are typically found on roads and on the side of buildings with malls and shopping areas.\n5. Therefore we could infer that a parking lot would be the proper answer.\n6.\nAnswer: C - Parking Lot \n\nInput: The house was a bit old, were the rooms very dark? Choices:  D: a little B: a bit A: a lot C: very\nRationales:  1. The first half of the question asks about the house condition, the second half asks about room lighting.\n2. D: \"a little\" should not be the answer because it implies something a bit above the level of \"barely any\" where C: \"very\" is situated. \n3. B: \"a bit\" should not be the question either because it is too vague, and C: \"very\" should not be possible due to its repetition in the question.\n4. Both A: \"a lot\" and C: \"very,\" are synonymous and refer to the degree of something, e.g., \"light\", \"darkness.\"\n5. Both options have a high degree, but C: \"very dark\" has a higher degree than A: \"a lot of darkness.\"\n6. C: \"very dark,\" therefore, should be the obvious answer.\nAnswer: C \u2014 Very dark\n\nInput: How many men are in this town? Choices:  B: 22 D: twenty-two A", "answer": "C: wyoming"}

Choices: A: open B: published C: available D: free E: unpublished\nRationales: The question revolves around what caused the book that they were searching for to be unreachable. \nAfter some searching, they found it wasn't available due to 5.\n6. A friend suggested that this was because the book \"was not published\", therefore the correct answer is C: unpublished.\nAnswer: C : published\n\nInput: There are two ways a ship can get into a harbor, either A what? at B what?\nRationales: This question requires us to identify an action and a noun. \nThe action is \"get into a harbor\" and the noun is \"ship\".\nThe words 'of way' are ambiguous and could be referring to \"manner of\" or some other phrase.\nSkipping them reveals that the question asks about two ways a ship can enter its harbor.\n6. In this case, the choices refer to the places the ship is traveling to, whether that is a destination (harbor) or a maneuver (way).\n7. The first and last choices are correct as they both refer to 'to maneuver' (way) or 'to destination' (harbor).\n8. Thus, the possible answers are A: way and B: harbor.\nAnswer: A : manner or B : destination or harbor\n\nInput: The answer to this problem is not clear. It can what?

Choices:  bacteriophage A: an animal that infects bacteria  bacteriophages B: a phage against bacteria C: a phage against animals  bacteriophag\nRationales:\n1. The problem statement mentions a 'bacteriophage' in the form of two different words. Bacteriophage, in biological terms, is a type of virus that infects a certain kind of bacteria.\n2. Looking a the given options, we can infer that Choices A and A don't make sense as they're not the correct word for 'bacteriophages'.\n3. We can rule out Choices B and B because it describes the opposite direction for a bacteriophages which is 'against bacteria'. We need the answer to be a bacteriophag which is 'again against an animal'.\n4. Thus, Choice C makes sense as the given word bacteriophag is one form of the word bacteriophage.\n5.

They relate to any type of organization. They do not point to a specific kind of business. It is best to consider the context of the overall sentence. 4. The \"out\" implies the company started doing an activity during its early days, indicating it was not a recent establishment. 5.

Although there are plenty of places to sell anything: farm, store, supermarket, shop, and so on, cheese is commonly sold in supermarkets.\n3. Cheese is an easily accessible item to bring to supermarkets for sale because of its weight and the limited production or manufacturing of the item.\n4. Therefore, the answer to the question is I: supermarket.\nAnswer: I: supermarket\n\nInput: Are there more gamblers than professional players? Choices:  B: yes A: no E: unknown\nRationales: The question is asking about the prevalence of professional players in gambling as opposed to amateur or recreational players.\n1. Option B: \"Yes\" is the most accurate answer because the question asks us to determine whether there are more professional players than gamblers/amateurs.\n2. In general, the professionals are more skillful and experienced in their respective fields, but not always.\n3. Hence, \"yes\" is the appropriate answer.\nAnswer: B. Yes\n\nInput: Are many professional dancers in a professional dance company? Choices:  E: yes A: no B: unknown \nRationales: We need to determine whether many professional dancers are in a professional dance company.\n1. Options E and A refer to possible scenarios where the professionals would be in the company, but none of these options are likely to be real world scenarios.\n2. Option B says that the professional dancers in the company is unknown. This could refer to the professional dancers being in the dance company, not being in the company, or even unknown.\n3. So, neither of the options clearly expresses a relationship between professional dancers and the company.\n4. Thus the answer to this question is E: yes.\nAnswer: E.

Choices: A: priceless B: expensive C: valuable D: broken E: useless\nRationales: The problem statement pertains to an old building that contained a collection of objects at one point in time. From the given options, we need to identify the descriptive adjective(s) that best describe the property the objects were once characterized by.  A: priceless -  This refers to objects whose worth is incalculable and exceeds the value of its individual parts. This description does not suit with the rest of the phrase, \u201ccontained a collection of objects.\u201d\nTherefore, it cannot be the correct answer.\nB: expensive -  This refers to items whose worth does not rely on one's individual status, but on their rarity or overall value. However, the sentence does not suggest the objects were valued because of their inherent high cost.\n\nC: valuable -  This refers objects of high worth, generally meaning their worth exceeds the inherent worth or productivity of their individual components. It fits with the overall description of the object.\nD: broken -  This refers to an object whose components are not functional and have been unable to fulfil its original use.\nE: useless -  This refers to useless in nature. The adjective indicates an object is unused for a particular purpose, but it\u2019s in no way related to its value.\n11. The only choice that suits the above description is \u2018C - valuable.\u2019  Therefore, the correct answer is \u2018C - valuable\u2019.\nAnswer: C - Valuable\n\nInput: What did the woman say as she made herself ready to fly on a boat?

We can eliminate the first three choices now as the tree would need a hill or rocky hillside to be present in the context.\n9. So, our answer choices left are, 'rocky hillside E' and 'tree E'.\n10. Since both answers include a 'tree' and the question asks for 'high places', but 'rocky hillside'doesn't offer suitable 'hands' to 'get to the top of the tree'.\n11. So, the answer must have 'rocky-hillside' and 'tree', but also 'hands' such as a 'ladder'.\n12.

The answer is C: shoe store\n4. The answer is D: shoe store\n5. The answer is E: boot factory\nRationales: The question asks for the place where \"shinola\" is found. Let's break down the context by listing the options and looking closer at each of them.\n6. Option A: \"shoe store\" is the location that most people go to get shinola, but since the word \"shoe\" is repeated twice within the answer choices, we can eliminate option A as redundant.\n7. Option B: \"shoe store,\" when used within the options, is referring to the very same place as option A. This option would essentially be a repetition of option A, making it too specific to the question.\n8. Option C: \"boot factory\" is an interesting choice because \"boot\" is often associated with \"shinola\". The word \"factory\" is generally used to imply a manufacturing facility, which makes the contextual reference for this option somewhat vague.\n9. Thus we decide that option C is too vague to be the answer.\n10. Option D: \"shoe store.\" Option D uses the same key words in the context as option A and B, but doesn't provide the necessary specificity of place to be considered the answer.\n11. Option E: \"boot factory.\" Option E is also referring to", "answer": "B: look attractive"}

B: the exchange rate 3. C: both the units themselves and the exchange rate 4. D: the conversion rate E: none of the options above\nRationales:\n1. The wording \"use different units of currency\", suggests that the country uses a different currency or money than the United States.\n2. This could imply a wide range of different things could go wrong.\n3. To be certain, we should carefully examine each of the options individually to determine what specifically goes wrong in case we visit a foreign country that uses a currency or money with a unit not comparable to ours.\n4. Going through the given options, we immediately identify that there is no issue with the unit itself. Using different currency has no direct implication on the unit or units associated with that money or currency.\n5. Next, we look at the second option: \"use different units of exchange rate\". While this could mean using a different unit for exchange rates, it can also just mean using a different exchange rate or conversion rate, which still refers to the conversion from one unit to another. Using a foreign unit of conversion or exchange rate could still be very confusing and lead to inaccuracies.\n6. Since this is our current country's currency which is being compared against the foreign currency, it's possible to apply this conversion rate as is. This makes it a viable option.\n7. However, we cannot apply options A: the units themselves or C: both the units of currency and the conversion rate.\n8. Going through each of the options, we observe that the use of a different unit of currency or money per se does not necessarily cause an error. Thus, to rule out the first option, A: the units themselves, we see that using different units of currency or money is not necessarily an error.\n9. Conversely, C: both the units and the conversion rate, if we were using them, it might lead to inaccuraudies because using the conversion rate of the foreign country could lead to inaccuracied results.\n10.

Choices: 10:00 pm 12:00 am 5:00 pm 5:00 am\nRationales: What time did he finally closed his windows? The word finally means it's happened or taken place prior to another specific hour.\nThe dog's bark kept him awake. The statement is referencing an event that happened just prior to the dog barking. The question then needs to ask us to determine the specific hour which occurred before the dog barking event.\n\nAnswer:  There were not enough choices with only 3.\nIf you read the sentence where the dog barking happened, it happened at the end of the day, so we know it was not 10:01pm, 10:30pm, or any time prior to 6pm. We also know it's not 1pm or 2pm or anytime before 10:0pm. If we think about it, the dog's bark should have happened at around 5pm or 5:30pm, so we can eliminate 1:00pm, 2:00pm, and 3:00pm as possible answers, since none of those hour choices have either 5 or 5:3 in them.\nSince I know the dog's barks happened at around 5:30, the only remaining options available are 5:00pm and 5:00am. Those two options are the correct ones, and 5:05 is not. It's 5:05, 5:10, 5:15, and so on after 5.\nHence, since the correct answer is '5:00 pm, '5:00 am' is the best choice to indicate the time when he finally closed his windows.\nAnswer: 5:00 PM\n\nInput: Where is it best to find books on cooking?

For option A, we find that the speaker is looking for a small quantity of food. \nFor the option E, on the other hand, we'd find that the speaker is seeking for a big serving or a meal. For option B, we have a word that suggests something light like a side dish. For option C, we have something that is generally a large quantity of food.\nAs for option D, we have something that doesn't sound like food but more like drink. The answer to the question is therefore option E, something that is a large serving, meaning option C. \nAnswer: C: a meal\n\nInput: Is there a difference between when a cow is fed and when a cow is milked?

Choices:  No answer: turn on A: power plant B: streetlight C: socket D: switch\nRationales:  1. The statement \"if the switch turns on the light\" implies that there's some other component to turn on that needs to be turned on to turn on the light.\n2. The four options given in the question are all possibilities, it's up to us to eliminate those that don't answer the question.\n3. Option 'No Answers' can be eliminated because a single word is not suitable as an answer.\n4. Option 'Turn on' could be considered an answer to the question but does not add any new information.\n5. If the switch is what turns on the light, the only possible option for the 'other component' would be the'socket'\n6. It is the socket that connects with both the switch and the light.\n7. Therefore the answer is D: socket.\nAnswer: D. socket\n\nInput: Cars have parts such as tires and brakes that help with what? Choices:   A: acceleration B: stopping C: driving D: braking E: powering\nRationales:   1. The word \"parts\" suggests that there is more to these mechanisms than just their singular functions.\n2. The various parts of a car can be used for multiple functions.\n3. In this context, the car's \"parts\" or \"components\", is what are known as \"systems\".\n4.

Person could be easily reached in some areas, but not others.\n2. Inside versus Outside\n3. A person could be reached inside his/her residence or apartment.\n4. In their living areas, people do not go outside frequently as a result of Covid-19 restrictions. These restrictions also influence people's outside/ inside activity.\n5. As a result, most communications from people occur inside, not out.\n6. Outside communications might take place in places such as open parks or sidewalks outside of buildings.\n7. The word \"out\" also refers to a place \"under the sky,\" such as a garden.\n8. A tree, for instance, may also be outside, but not inside the residence.\n9. The word \"up\" refers to a place that is \"close to the sky,\" such as the rooftops of buildings. However, reaching a tree may not be accomplished as easily as reaching a rooftop.\n10.

Choices:  O: antlers B: branches C: buttresses D: roots E: trunk\nRationales:1. The text is saying that a big tree is strange with nothing but branches, but not much else.\n2. This implies the possibility that there's something else attached to the tree.\n3. The options do not fully describe the tree. They do not provide any sufficient context to find the correct answer.\n4. The tree is big but has no branches. It also is not a coniferous tree which is one that's made solely of branches.\n5. This leaves us with the options: A, C, D, or E.\n6. As E: trunk suggests, what we can determine is that the tree has a trunk.\n7. As C: buttresses describes, a tree can be described as having buttresses.\n8. As A: antlers defines, what we can know is that this tree does not necessarily have antlers.\n9. Thus the correct answer is: B: branches, which could have buttresses or antlers.\nAnswer: B.\n\nInput: Which type of shoe do you have?

Choices: \n  A: Because it was too long B: to balance themselves \n  C: to keep themselves warm D: to protect them from predators E: to prevent tripping\nRationales: The question refers to why 'they' (plural) have two tails. We know this because 'they' was mentioned in the question.\n4. Considering the options we are led to believe that 'they' (plurals refer to a number of people) have two tails so that they can do something: \n 1. Option A: \"because it was too long\" does not make any sense in context. Tails cannot be that long without being a problem for humans.\n 2. Option B: \"to balance themselves\" is a strange statement. People do not need tails to balance themselves.\n 3. Option C: \"to keep them warm\" is possible, as tails are sometimes used as clothing to protect someone from the cold.\n 4. Option D: \"to protect them from predators\" is also a good statement, because tails are sometimes an important protective part of some people's clothing.\n5. Option E: \"to prevent tripping\" could be the correct answer because the tail may be used as a cane, and as a cane is used to keep someone steady as they walk. We understand what's asked by ruling out options A, B, and D.\n6. Thus the answer is E.\nAnswer: E \n\nInput: Some cash registers use pennies, what do others use? Choices: 1. A: nickels\n2.

Choices: A: blind B: deaf C: silent D: slithering E: loud\nRationales: This problem statement asks whether owls are nocturnal.  Then, it asks what an animal that is nocturnal is often like.  It provides 5 choices\n1. It is not required to answer choice B to answer choice A. We just need to answer choice D, because an animal that is nocehtnal is also slithering.\n2. If choice D is not correct, the answer is not \"Deaf\". It could be the answer by elimination for choices D,E,F,G,H\n3. So if choice D is \"Slithering\": the answer is \"Blind (E) or Deaf (F). \"Blind\" is not chosen because it is incorrect. \"Deaf\" is the correct choice then the answer is \"deaf\".\n4. The answer could be \"Slithering\" or \"Nocturnal\" depending on the answer to choice B. For example, if we pick \"Nocturnal\": the answer is not \"Unseen (G) or Blind (E)\". Nocturnal is always followed by Slithering\n5. If an animal is nocturnal, it will be seen mostly the night, even in the daytime. It will be more likely to be seen during the night rather than during the day. It will not be found on the ground and it will look for prey during the night.\n6. The answer is \"Slithering (D) and Nocturnal (A)\" or \"Slithering (A) and Nocturnoal (D)\".\nAnswer: D: Nocturnal and A: Slithering.

Choices:  a) the body's hydration b) the body's cleanliness c) the body's health d) the body's pH e) the body's hygiene\nRationales: The question asks about the 'body's' _______. Choices are:  a) hydration; b) cleanliness; c) health; d) pH; e) hygiene.\n\n1.) Firstly, we need to ascertain what a water's _pH_ means.\n2.) While _pH_ stands for _potential_ and sometimes potential _hydrogen_, it also usually means _pH_ level in water.\n3.) This means _pH_ is the level of acidity or alkalinity of the water.\n4.) The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14 which indicates acidic to basic or alkaline conditions respectively.\n5.) With this information, we can rule out A) _hydration_ and B) _cleanliness_, as they do not seem to have to do with pH levels directly.\n6.) In a body or environment, what is required to be _clean_ is that it is _hygienic_. These are two different categories.\n7.) Likewise, _health_ is a different concept that cannot be directly linked to pH levels.\n8.) So, between A-E again, we must choose between A and E.\n9.) Of the remaining choices, _pH_ is likely the only one that refers to the pH levels of the body. (This is a bit of a guess, as it relates to water.)\n10.) However, _hygiene_ might well be referring to maintaining good pH levels in the body in general.\n11.) Since _hygiene_ is more general, we will go with E) _hygiene_.\n12.)

It's not a song about or for cows and therefore cannot be sung to cows.\n2. Flower also does not fit as the question suggests being about a cow.\n3. The next two options contain the word cow. \"Old Shep\" is a song about a dog, not a cow, however. \n4. Daisy has the word cow in it and is a cute song about a cow.\n5.

The answer is a tree.\n2. The options in the problem statement are places where a tree may be found.\n3  It's unlikely that a tree would be found in a desert because there are limited natural resources that could support tree growth and survival in a desert.\n4. Similarly, a tree is unlikely to reside in A: mountain because the topography is unsuitable and lacks supportive resources conducive to tree life.\n5. In addition, B: forest and C: desert would also not be suitable locations for a tree to be located because they have environments not favorable to tree growth.\n6.

Choices:  B:  pool hall C: library D: pool A: classroom B: church C: gym D: library\nRationales: The key to the answer lies in the meaning of `pool`. The question talks about an environmental place to avoid. \n1. A \"pool\" is not the same as a \"swimming pool\". Rather, a \"pool\" is an area or region, as defined by the context of the question.\n2. Looking through the options, `pool hall` and `gym` are two locations where people usually go for recreation, and therefore are not environmental places to avoid.\n3. So are `library (D)` and `classroom (A) (B)`. `B` means to `belong to`. Therefore, they refer to areas associated with a person or their social life.\n4. This leaves us with the options of `B`: `pool hall` and the other is `C`: `library`.\n5. The first option, `pool hall`, has an immediate negative inference in relation to the person's issue, as it involves the possibility that they will go to this place, where they are likely to be exposed to substances that will trigger the asthmatic reaction.\n6. The other option, the `library`, is a place where people are likely to", "answer": "C: pleasing"}

We need to determine what kinds of places a hedgehog would prefer to dig, based on its nature and preferences.\n2. From the five available choices, it appears that A, E, and C speak to kinds of vegetations or environments.\n3. All three choices pertain to places devoid of rocky or gravelly surfaces or structures. This means that hedgehogs would prefer such places for digging.\n4. On the other hand B and D suggest some kind of surface or structure to dig beneath, implying that these are unlikely scenarios.\n5. Thus, the most apt choices are B and D as C, A, and E do not adequately answer the question.\n6. Therefore we can conclude that a hedgehog \"usually likes\" to dig in hilly fields and gravel paths.\nAnswer: B : hilly field   D : gravel path\n\nInput: Where is it more prudent to study in a storm?

Considering the six choices, the phrasing of a \"storm\" is suggestive of severe weather where thunder, lightning, and heavy rain are common.\n2. Based on this context, A and E are less relevant choices as they denote indoors spaces. \n3. We also know that a storm is a time period when it's windy and wet, implying that there would be some movement of air and moisture.\n4. Based on this and looking at the available choices, we can infer that 'bedroom' and 'den' are unlikely to be the more prudent location.\n5. 'B' speaks to the shelter area for storms.

Of these four categories, 'in a house' or 'inside the house' makes the most sense. Looking at each option, B, C, D, and E, they are all associated with 'in a house'.\n4. Therefore, C: house door and E: studio are redundant answers in the list.\n5. We are left with 'inside the house' and 'artist's bedroom', each of which seems plausible because an artist's work would typically be found within the house.\n6. However, considering 9, a question with the main idea of 'in a house' being asked, a more appropriate location for an artist's work is 'artist's crib' which implies the bedroom.\n7. Therefore the answer is B: artist's bedroom.\nAnswer: B. artist's room\n\nInput: The dog chased its owner where? Choices:  a. towards owner b. on side of owner c. in front of owner d. behind owner e. next to owner\nRationales: The structure of the question consists of two options. So, the answer will be found in the location of the dog as per the other choices of owner.\n1. 'A: towards owner' is the least viable choice out of these. The dog cannot have chased the owner if he moved", "answer": "C: hock"}

Choices: 1: by crackling them 2: by peeling them 3: by grating them 4: by roasting them 5: by grinding them\nRationales:\n1. The question asks how peanuts and nus are made.\n2. The options given are how peanuts and nut are made.\n3. The option for roasting and grinding indicate that the answer would include them.\n4. We would not crack roasted and ground nuts, nor would cracked and ground nuts be roasted and ground, so we don't choose any answer like this.\n5. The peanut has one major step in the process where you crack it open, the nut has one major step in their process where you crack it.\nIn each case, the options describe how the peanut/nut is made, the question however asks how peanuts/nuts are made.\nAnswer: 1: by CRACKLING them.\n\nInput: What kind of poultry are chickens and turkeys? Choices: \nA: birds B: mammals C: reptiles D: wild animals E: insects\nRationales: The question asks what kind of poultry chickens and turkey are. We have 5 options, Birds, Mammals, Reptiles, Wild animals and insects(or bugs). The question asks about poultry. Birds are not poultry, they are classified as wild animals. Mammals are classified as poultry. Reptiles are classified as wildlife, they are classified under animals/animals wildlife category. Turkeys and Chickens are birds. Turkeys are not classified as poultery. Therefor, Turkeys and Chickened are both classified as mammals. Therefore, the answer, in both cases, is C: mammals.\n\nInput: Which of these is a good choice to eat for breakfast?

Choices: A: box B: basement C: back-yard D: parlor E: dungeon\nRationales: Firstly, the sentence has multiple problems. First, there's no definite article \"the\" which makes the statement sound more like just a statement then a question.\nSecond, the statement that comes after is lacking a verb which makes it feel more like a question than an observation.\nLastly, the term \"gloomy\" is not clear. The context \"house\" would generally mean the building and not what's inside it. So what could be gloomy inside a building?\n2. This is because dungeon refers to a dark chamber, specifically a basement or cellar.\n3. So, the answer to this question is E: Dungeon.\nAnswer: E-Dungeon\n\nInput: Which of the choices most closely matches the definition of an icecream which is a sweet snack made with vanilla and icecream? Choices: 1. A: chocolate cake 2. B: pizza 3. C: icecream 4. D: cheesecake 5. E: candy\nRationales: The question is meant to test how well one knows the word icecream in particular, which we can understand as either ice cream or icecream.\nThe phrase \"most closely matches\" is ambiguous since it can either mean the word icecream or the food item.\nTherefore, it's important that we understand that the phrase refers to either option.\nThe key to answering this question correctly is then to figure out what options closely match the definition of icecream.\nAn icecream is a sweet snack, but cheesecakes and pizzas aren't sweet, so they would be incorrect.\nA chocolate cake is a sweet snack by definition, and vanilla icecream can be substituted for.\nTherefore, the best options are icecream and cake.\nAnswer: E) B: pizza \n\nInput: Which is closer to the", "answer": "D: old cheese"}

The question asks for a typical person's make-up.\n2. We need to identify the context of the word \"make-up\", which will assist us in choosing the appropriate response.\n3. A typical person is made up of certain components as described by the question as given options.\n4. In context, the term \"make up\" is referring to clothes, cosmetics, make-up, or other items that adorn a human to enhance their appearance.\n5. This rules out 'A: blood, bone, sin, tissue, and fat.' as responses.\n6. We could choose 'C. water, minerales, sugar, blood, fat, and tissue.' as an option because it may seem to be a typical make-up of a person.\n7. However, 'C. water, sugar, blood, minerals, fat, and sugar' lacks the aspect of appearance or appearance enhancing features inherent in the word'make up'.\n8. Option 'D. bones, tendon, muscles, fat tissue, and skin' is eliminated because this make-up includes a lot of items and it's not typically the typical make-up of an individual.\n9. Option 'B. muscles, blood sinews, skin and bone' is also not suitable because there may be discrepancies in which components may be missing.\n10. Moreover, sinews, which can be used in music, don't usually refer to the typical appearance of an individual either.\n11. So, we are left with two options based on their suitability and accuracy: 'A. blood, bone skin, tissue, blood, and fat', and 'E. water, mineraltse, blood, and fat'.", "answer": "A: coffee"}

The prompt is asking what is the'subject' in the context of paint works, 2. The choices are each noun, 3. We can eliminate choice D and E right away. B: landscape and C: still life cannot be considered as a subject here, since the work is a portrait, 4. The description does not mention a portrait. The painting we are looking for is in the context of an abstract painting. 5. Therefore, we should choose B and C.\nAnswer: (C, B) : Land and Still Life\n\nInput: Where was the mug designed? Choices: TA: potter's workshop B: kitchen C: dishwasher D: restaurant E: cupboard\nRationales: The answer can only be one of the place options. The question asks where the mug was \"designed\", so an answer will be an place where the mug was created or designed, instead of the person who made it. We can eliminate D: restaurant, because it makes no sense to design a mug in a cupboard. The other choices are all possible places to find the mug on the question. We can eliminate C: dishwsher, because the mug gets designed before it enters the dishwasher. B - kitchen, and E - cupboard can both be possible choices. We know that in a kitchen, people may design and prepare mugs (for example coffee mugs) because they make food and have appliances, such as dishwashers, that mugs can be designed for. However, the problem does not ask about the kitchen or even dishes, so the kitchen is not necessary for this context.

So, the answer choices E: tree is the correct one.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: Where is a toddler likely to spend their time playing? Choices: A: kitchen B: bedroom C: outdoors D: living room E: bathroom\nRationales: The question is asking about the potential location of a toddler playing. Toddlers are too young to play in a bathroom since they can't use the bathroom on their own. They'd have trouble playing in the bedroom or in the living room. Therefore, this leaves us with Choices B (bedroom), C (outdoors), D (living room), and E (bathroom).  Toddlers are a little too young for their own bathroom, but their parents' or caretakers' bathrooms can count.  Toddlers don't spend a lot of time in the kitchen, and the choice implies cooking, which would also be outside typical range of a toddler's activity.  A good way to determine this would be to think about how long you might be willing to spend in these places and if you were allowed to. If the kitchen was the location, you would find yourself in an unusual situation.  To solve this problem, we need to eliminate the bathroom and the choice of kitchen. Let's work through the remaining choices.  Bedrooms aren't the best choices for toddlers to play in. A bedroom is typically private and adult-focused. A toddler might get some access to the playroom of the bedroom, but the bedroom itself is unlikely.  A living room is another bad choice for a toddler. Even when parents try to set up their living room to be a toddler-friendly space, it typically does not turn out well for the toddler, and toddlers will not end up spending most of their time in that spot.  Let's take a look and determine which locations are most likely to allow for a toddler to spend most of their time playing in and which locations would be less likely and therefore don't deserve a place on the answer list. Let's take a quick look at the final options.  The answer choices are", "answer": "D: food court"}

Choices: A: happiness B: pain C: frustration D: anger E: joy\nRationales:\n(1).The question is asking what the reason for tears might be.\n(2).We know the \"girl\" is crying, but are not sure about the reason for this.\n(3).Analyzing the options, we can infer that \"happiness\" and \"joy\" mean that the reason behind the crying is a form of positive emotions. The other options can be categorized as negative emotions and are the reason for tears.\n(4).The question asks us to find the cause of tears which will be provided by positive emotions as they cause one to laugh instead of cry.\n(5).Therefore, the correct option is D or E. \n(6).Now D: anger and E: joy are similar in structure, so we will pick D. This option can be picked over E because of the context.\n(7).E: joy can easily be picked out because of the first word which makes it clear that the girl is crying for joy.\n(8).

We need to interpret this statement to determine what position they might be in while doing so.\n1.

The missing word refers to what kind of choice would a student, school, teacher, or pupil make? We need to determine what choices are suitable for each of them.\n1. Considering the options provided, we can infer that a student would say 'B: school'.\n2. A 'B: school' wouldn't say a particular choice was \"bad\", indicating the need to eliminate B: school.\n3. Similarly, a 'D: pupil' wouldn't say \"bad\" either, so eliminate D: pupil.\n4. Next, a 'C: teacher' would generally be the authority in the situation.\n5. A teacher would usually say the choice were \"right\" or \"great\", not \"bad\". Therefore, eliminate 'C: teacher'.\n6. Also, for a 'C: teacher', the choice of \"good\" is suitable, so eliminate 'E: tutor'.\n7.

The only options that involve a horse or barn are 'I: horse' and 'V: hay'.\n\n2. Other options mention 'barn' or'shoeing' but don't make reference to either a horse, or hay.\n\n3. We know that the barn is where horse shoeing, or the trimming and fitting of horseshoes, happens. \n\n4. Therefore, horseshoeing is done in a barn because it is where hay is found. \n\n5.

Choices: A: fruit cake B: carrot cake C: white cake D: chocolate cake E: sponge cake\nRationales: - The problem statement implies that the cake is described as sweet.\n- The choices provide several possible categories of cakes, all with distinct flavor profiles.\n- In light of the options given, a fruit cake can be easily discounted on the basis that the term'sweet' does not apply to it.\n- A chocolate cake can be ruled out as well because it describes a cake with a bitter flavor, not one that would be described as sweet.\n -The other three choices, namely 'white cake', 'carrot cake' and'sponge cake' could each be a potential category of cake.\n -However, given that the cake is sweet, we can narrow down the field even further.\n -White cakes are not inherently sweet, as some of them are actually rather bland. While carrot cakes typically feature savory ingredients like spice and carrots which are typically not regarded as sweet.\n -Sponge cakes are often very sweet because they contain a lot of sugar relative to the other ingredients they are made from. This makes them likely candidates.\n -To further determine the answer, it can be evaluated how the cake is likely to be classified. A 'fruit cake' or a 'chocolate cake' could easily be described as sweet, although 'carrot cakes' are likely not, and the answer may be too open ended and ambiguous if we're not sure what flavor cake the problem statement refers to.\n -Based on this rationale, the answer must be C: white sponge cake. \n -The correct answer is C: sponge cakes.\n\nInput: People from Alaska can grow what?

Choices: A: interesting B: exhilerating C: delectable D: mouthwatering E: wonderful F: tasty\nRationales: The problem statement indicates that a dish was made with rice and \"spiced\" chicken.  We need to understand which characteristics of the dish were referenced in the question.\n1. The terms \"interesting\", \"exhilirating\", \"delectable\", \"mouthwatering\", \"wonderful\", and \"tasty\" convey different aspects of the dish's characteristic.\n2. Looking closer, all of these options, except for \"tasty\", are positive adjectives that describe emotional responses to the dish. This implies that the characteristic being referred to is related to something someone experienced with the dish.\n3. The rest of the description of the dish refers to physical aspects. Therefore, one must account for the other parts of the statement that indicate there must be something positive about the physical experience of consuming the dish.\n4. This narrows the choices to 'A: interesting', 'B: exhilarating', 'C: delectable', and 'F: tasty'. \n5. While 'A: interesting', and 'B: exhilirating' both imply an event or action that was memorable (or interesting) to someone.  None of them refer to the sensibility or sense experience of the dish.\n6. Similarly, 'C: delectible' and 'F: tasted' both allude to a positive or pleasant aspect of sensing something with your nose. In this case, someone who eats or tastes the dish.\n7.

Choices:  (a) She likes to milk him (b) He\u2019s a good friend (c) He is on diet (d) He hates goats (e) Goats make him nervous\nRationales: This question was multiple choice with only one correct answer.\nFrom the context of the question, the sentence contains two parts, the first sentence introducing the farmer and the market and a second sentence containing the answer to \u201cDo you know why?\u201d question. So we need to extract the answer from this sentence. From the options that were listed. (d) He hats goats (e) goats make him nervous (b) He is a good friend (c). Can be used.\n1. The correct answer, (b) He\u2019 is a good friend (b) is not the first one among the options.\n2. The correct answer is the second option on the list. Among the two options that can be used, (e). A goat is a farm animal to which he is not too close (a). Is a reason why and (c) He is diet. Is not the reason behind why.\n3. We have to identify the reason why the farmer left his go at the market. And the first answer that comes to our mind is (b) He\u2019 hates goats (b). But it\u2019s not the correct answer.\n4. From the context, the reason behind why the farmer left the goat with a lady is a good friend or a good relationship, he loves or cares for him (e). Does not seem to be the reason.\n5. From what we learn above, (b) He is of a good friend is the correct answer.\n\nInput: The teacher taught 18 students.  She knew each one ______________.

A: fortune B: a lucky charm C: love D: attention E: stardom\nRationales: The question presents a situation where many people want to be successful or achieve their ambitions. To find the right answer, I'll dissect the phrase \"turn to\" to understand the context. The clue is \"turn\". The word \"turn\" has two associated meanings. It means, (i) going or moving in a circular course or motion, or (ii) a reversal of direction or motion. Hence, the question presents, \"to go to achieve something\" in other words, to \"make a change\". We don't ask what change do they make but what do they do to achieve it? Hence, the answer: \"do.\"\n\nAnswer: F: fame.\n\nInput: A shady individual is what? Choices: F: trustworthy H: honest I: trusted J: trusted\nRationales: Considering that the question has given a negative connotation, it implies that a shady person is not trustworthy, honest, or trusted J.\n\nComment: We need more context to answer a question, especially when there's an obvious missing word(s).

Cheetah 7. Camel 8. Bear 9. Elephant 10. Zebra\nRationales: The problem statement suggests that an animal had to wait until new food was being served.\n1. Food being served can only occur in a place where a food is usually served. Hence, we can eliminate 1. Giraffes, 6. Camels 7.Camels 8. Bears.\n2. Animals 3 Lizards 4 Koalas 5 Octopi do not need to wait as long as 10 Zebras.\n3. If an animal cannot wait, it will not have to wait for food to be served.\n4. In conclusion, only cheetah, leopard, pigeon, and zebra can wait. Since pigeons cannot wait for long, leopards and cheetahs cannot wait for food for more than one meal.\n5. Zebras can wait for a long time for food, but they do not need to wait, as it is served for them.\n6. A camel or bear has to wait for food to arrive but cannot wait because they need to eat immediately after food arrives.\n7. Therefore from the three remaining answers, the answer is - 10.

Eight hours E F. Naps\nRationales: The question asks us to identify what is often missing for many people who suffer from sleep Apnea.\n1. We can infer from the given context that sleep/rest refers to a quality of uninterrupted and consistent sleep over a period of eight hours. \n2. This is consistent with 'D: Eight hours', 'E: F: Naps', and 'F: Naps'.\n3. We can eliminate 'Rest' and 'Dreams'.\n4. 'Dreams' do not refer to sleep and are often a consequence of the eight hours sleep in which the subject takes a much-desired 'nap'.\n5. 'Rest' refers to short term sleeps, and not the quantity of rest that is often lacking  in people with sleep Apnea.\n6. Thus we are left with the answer being 'E: Naps'\n7. This is the correct choice because naps are usually missing in the life of people suffering from sleep-Apnea.\nAnswer: E Naps (Naps are often missed. )\n\n### Hints:\n1.

I will explain each of these option below:\n\n*B: Battery : The boy was playing with battery toy helicopter with a small problem, but he can't play because the battery was dead and he didn't have any extra battery.\n*D: Helicopter: Now in the toy helicopters he was playing in the problem statement he had the helicopter but he didn't have the extra batteries so that he had not to play with it because his batteries were dead in the last he played with it.\n*E: Toy: Toy refers to an alternative game name of helicopter which was a child's toy, that's way he was playing the helicopter but didn't have the batteries to play it.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is option B: Battery as the given statement had mentioned that his toy was helicopter which had not a battery but he didn't had the battery to play the toy.\n\nInput: If a car was driving along the road and it suddenly stopped because it hit a tree and it fell the tree and the car the tree would be what?

Therefore, we can infer that Marmots are likely to be found in a tree. The correct answer is thus E: tree.\nAnswer: E. tree\n\n### Explanation:\nIn each of the problems above, there were some specific clues, hints, or contextual elements that enabled us to answer the question.\n\nIn problem 1, we were required to identify the \"apparatus\". The sentence structure, phrase context, and our knowledge of the sentence being an open-ended question clue us in that the word required is \"apparatus.\"\n\nIn problem 2, we were asked to pick a location from a list of potential places. One of the options was \"university\", but to be able to eliminate and pick the other answer, we needed to know that generally, where universities exist there are likely to be people.\n\nWe were again confronted in problem 3 with a list of potential choices, including \"lunch box\", \"food store,\" and \"kitchen\", which are places that people could be found. Again, to be able to eliminate the other options we needed to make an inference, this time determining that the item being specified in the question is a wine country.\n\nIn problem number 4, the phrase \"portrait painting\" in the question led us to think that a painter had made a statement about how he never achieved perfection. The question then goes on to tell us that the painter was referring to all people. We were able to get a better idea of this from the options, where \"disfigured\", and \"defective\" were obviously not appropriate, while \"damaged\" and \"flawed\" are more ambiguous in their application. The latter choices indicate a \"deficiency\", not one that affects everyone. Therefore by elimination, \"imperfect\" fits best.\n\nProblem number 5 presented us with the word \"shark\" along with a phrase that may be either relevant or unrelated. The phrase \"shark betting game\" makes it more certain that the word is not referring to an actual shark. We were then able to eliminate \"pool hall\" as the answer since the word \"bathing suit\" indicates that betting takes place in a specific", "answer": "C: fun"}

Choices: A: chords B: notes C: songs D: melody E: measures\nRationales:1. The question contains several parts that require a response.\n2. The sentence begins with some context setting, and then a comparison which is what the question is about.\n3. We need to start by clarifying the context setting.\n4. The sentence states that the music was \"lovely, it consisted of\" many instruments which played \"measures.\"\n5. Measures are \"lines.\" They're what musical pieces are comprised of.\n6. By saying that the music \"consists of\" measures or \"lines,\" it essentially tells us that music is a collection of lines.\n7. Thus the context refers to a musical composition. This part is important to consider because we want to make sure that our choices are all about music, not something else.\n8. After we confirm the type of music, we can move on to the comparison, which focuses on the instruments.\n9. To find the answer we want to find the instrument that is doing the \"playing\" of the pieces.\n10. Remember that \"notes\" are distinct sounds that are played by various instruments, and \"melody\" is the arrangement.\n11. So, instruments that play music cannot be choosing notes or melody, as they do not exist separately and cannot be played by themselves.\n12. With this in mind, answer C: songs is incorrect because they cannot be playing on their own.\n13. A: chords and E: measures refer to lines of music. However, chords refer to an arrangement of notes as opposed to one instrument playing a line on its own.\n14. Therefore, A: chords is also not correct.\n15. The answer to this question is D: melody.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: I went to the store to pick up what?

Choices:  E: lunch B: dinner C: breakfast D: supper E: brunch\nRationales:\n1. The question is about food and how it is relevant for people fasting.\n2. 'Brunch' and 'lunch' indicate time of day when the food is typically eaten which are not appropriate for answering the question.\n3. 'Breakfast' and'supper' refer to mealtime at the beginning or end of the day. However, supper is typically eaten in the evening and is not suitable as the person is fasting.\n4. The only choice 'Brunch' is not specified as to when it's eaten thus, it could be eaten any time of the day, including morning.\n5. As this term is an oxymoron, it makes it unsuitable as it does not relate to meal patterns of fasting people.\n6. Hence, the correct choice for 'What's a very special meal for a person who is fooding' is 'E: Dinner'.\nAnswer: E: Dinner", "answer": "D: parking lot"}

Choices:  I. Faulty feelings II. Unsupportive feelings III. Negative feelings IV. Supportive feelings\nRationales:1. The question revolved around the team during a match and asked what the coach felt towards them although not achieving victory.\n2. From the problem description, it's important that we acknowledge the state of the team and how they're feeling as this will enable us to infer the coach's feelings regarding them.\n3. First, the coach is happy about the team's enthusiasm but frustrated about their lack of victory.\n4. Hence he must at least feel 'Negative' towards the team.\n5. However, since he must also feel grateful to the team's level of enthusiasm during the match, it is logical to assume he is at least feeling'supportive.'\n6. However, it's not explicitly stated in the choices given, so we can't be certain about this option.\n7. 'Unsupportive' can only be the case if the coach is not happy about the enthusiasm shown by the team but is frustrated by their lack of victory that he would like them to achieve.\n8. But as we know the coach likes to see the team enthusiastic, he wouldn't 'Unsupportively' feel about them.\n9. As we know there is an option that describes the coach's 'Negative' feeling, it follows that the answer must be 'I: Faulty Feelings'.\nAnswer:  I: Faulty Feeling\n### Exercise Section 2 (Questions 1-9)\n\n### Instructions:\n\nIn the passage below, some words are missing.

Choices: A: his head B: the dealer C: luck D: his arms E: a friend\nRationales:\n1. The problem statement mentions him losing a hand of poker, indicating some form of playing cards, or 'cards' in general.\n2. If we look at the given choices we can see that all of them other than 'head' and 'dealers' are unsuitable options as they're not tangible, so can't be used in an attempt to beat a hand of cards.\n3. The term 'dealers', while it's an official title that one person is known by, does not refer to an entity that can be manipulated to win a hand of cards. It is a title for a person who holds the cards and deals them.\n4. Therefore, the answer only leaves us with 'head' and 'arms'.\n5. In theory, beating a hand of cards could be done by using 'head' or 'arms' as these parts of the body could potentially be used to overpower the cards with sheer strength.\n6. However, considering the context, we can infer that beating a hand of poker would require some sort of physical ability to do so.\n7. For a poker hand, one's head and arms usually do not play a significant role in determining the value of the card.\n8. More typically, players use their 'eyes' and 'hands' to determine their winning hand. \n9. Considering this, the answer is A.", "answer": "D: garden"}

Choices:  B: fence C: flowers D: lawn E: neighbor's house\nRationales:  1. The given problem statement, 'they like a lot of space', implies that the answer is a choice about space.\n2. Looking into the choices, choices 'B: fence', 'C: flowers', 'D: lawn', and 'E: neighbor's house' are all answers that have to do with space and can suitably be called answers.\n3. However, we know that dandelions are usually found very close to or next to houses.\n4. Therefore for this particular question, an answer related to distance is also acceptable, as long as it is 'far' or 'not very close'.\n5. An example of such an answer would be to answer that 'the dandelions like a lot of space away', which is an answer that satisfies all the requirements.\n6. Thus in this particular question, the answer choices are not limited solely to that which are about space.\n7. Furthermore, considering that a dandelion will be relatively near to a house, 'neighbour's house' is the most suitable answer that indicates 'far' space.\n8.

The'shifter,' most likely a father or a relative of the cousin's son, is asking if the individual in question (the cousin's son) is coming to the reunion.\n2.

Choices: A: reptilian B: fruity C: scaly D: furry E: hairy\nRationales:  1. According to the question, some insects have hair on their bodies.\n2. It's important to note the context of \"furry.\" Fur is something that covers animals, usually as part of their external anatomy.\n3. So, in this context 'furry' relates to external body structures. As such, we need to consider all the external bodily structures of an insect, which may include hair, feathers, exoskeleton, etc.\n4. Out of this, we can eliminate 'fruits' as they don't pertain to external body structures.\n5. Eliminating 'hair','scales', and 'exoskeleton', which are not hair-like, we can infer 'furry' means 'hairy' anatomy.\n6. Hence, the correct answer is E: hairy.\nAnswer: E. hairy\n\nInput: If it's cold, what does a car do?

First, analyse the answer choices to understand which ones are correct and which are incorrect.\n2. 'Very difficult to make', 'Very expensive to create', and 'Inexpensive to manufacture' are incorrect because no such inventions like paratrooper were hard or expensive to make.\n3. Instead,'simple' and 'easy to invent' are true because paratrooper, as an invention, did not have any particularly hard or expensive processes to make it.\n4. These answer choices are what's needed to answer the question.\nInput: What two events, were the two things that happen together. Choices:  A. an apple fell on Newton and it began to rain B. it began to rain and an apple fell on Newton. C. Newton fell on an apple and it began to rain D. an apple fell on an apple and Newton fell on it E. an apple fell on a Newton and it began to raing\nRationales: In order to answer the question, it is important to first identify the correct choice option. \n1. 'B. it began to rain', 'C. Newton fell on an Apple' and 'E. an apple fell on to a Newton and it began raining' are the incorrect options. These options do not match the description of the question. They describe an event such as 'apple falling on Newton' and 'rain', but they do not mention a 'Newton falling on an apple'. This is important given the description of the question's context which is the 'two events' occurring simultaneously.\n2. 'D. an apple fell on Newtons's apple and it began to", "answer": "A: nailed"}

Choices: A: ant B: wasp C: spider D: mosquito E: wash fly\nRationales: It's important to note the specific context of this question. The question states, \"The pest has been seen _on the grass_.\" This shows that the bug or pest is crawling or walking on the grass.\n1. \"Wasp\" could be a possible answer, but it doesn't walk on grass, so it isn't the right answer. \n2. \"Mosquito\" could also be the right answer, but the question doesn't ask for a flying pest, and it doesn't make sense for a mosquito to crawl on grass either. \n3. In contrast, \"ant\" and \"spider\" are both animals that can crawl on grass. \n4. There's only one pest or bug that fits the requirements. Since the question doesn't specify the pest, it can be any bug or pest, not a specific one.\n5. In conclusion, the answer is E: wash fly.\nAnswer: E. wash fly\n\nInput: The car had to go off road.  What sort of car could be what? Choices: A. 4 wheel drive B: hybrid C: diesel D: manual E: electric\nRationales: In this question, we are asked to find the description that best fits certain qualities of a vehicle.\n1. Since we already know what conditions the car is under, and that it had to \"go off road\", we can deduce that the car is in some way suited for such use.\n2. The car must therefore have one or more of four qualities: A. 4-wheeled drive B. Hybrid C. Diesel D. Manual E. Electric.\n3. The car does not have to have every quality, but it must have some combination of these.\n4. Option", "answer": "C: desk"}
{"text": "characteristic.\n7. So, we have 'A: inside', 'B: inside', 'C: inside', and 'E: tree'. Now, we've gathered the relevant variables from the question and context.

Among the options, 'A: inside', and 'B: inside' both imply a structure that could allow for upward climbing.\n10. 'C: inside', similarly, implies 'inside', thus increasing the probability of that being the intended response.\n11. However, the given answer is 'E:tree'. We can infer that this choice is an intentional mistake since if you were to take this response and substitute the two inside options with them the question would still be answered correctly with either 'inside'.\n12.

What was stolen from the car? Choices:  C: money B: clothes D: stereo E: radio\nRationales:\n1. The question asks what was stolen from the owner's car after it was broken into.\n2. Analysing the details provided, the theft may be considered to be an act of intentional vandalism from outside the car.\n3. The 'insurance agent' refers to an individual who is employed by an organization offering financial protection against loss or damage.\n4. In regards to the options provided, they primarily deal with material possessions either of monetary or sentimental value.\n5. 'Clothes', meaning what the owner wore that day, or'money' referring to what the owner had on them that day, are both reasonable options.\n6. However, 'radio' and'stereo' would not be items that someone would just steal for no reason other than to steal from the car.\n7. Therefore we can rule out options B and E.\n8. The remaining options are 'radio' and 'clothes'.\n9. A radio may be something that someone would steal because they want the accessories. This would not apply in the context of the question.\n10. Similarly, the owner would rather have their belongings intact than broken into because if they were damaged in a different place, the insurer may not be able to recover those damages.\n11. Therefore, the answer to our question is A: 'clothes'. \nAnswer: A: clothes\n\nInput: What happened to the fishing pole was a disaster.  The line was snapped so all the fish jumped out of the boat.

Choices: A: effort B: detail C: quality D: consistency E: time\nRationales: Considering the given context, the headmaster did not find the ideas to be lacking only one of the criteria mentioned in the choices (effort, detail, quality, consistency, or time).\n\nThe structure of the sentence is implying that the ideas were not rejected specifically for one of these characteristics, and it wouldn't be logically to rule out choices B, D, and E, as it would defeat the purpose of the sentence.\n\nAdditionally, the word \"always\" indicates that the ideas were not lacking any and all those qualities previously, but one of them only in the present moment (in the question frame).\n\nHence, the correct choice is C: quality.\n\nAnswer A: effort B: D: inconsistency E: consistent: quality\n\n#### 132.\n\nInput: Some people would say that dogs would never get enough time or play, if only they had what?

D: playmate\n\nIn addition, if a dog only has one playmate, this will quickly become boring as they'll be limited to the social interaction they can have with that person.\nOptions", "answer": "B: names"}

Choices:  Troy Pretend Fake Make believe Phony\nRationales: The word \"peasant\" denotes a person or social class from a region in a rural setting with mostly farming. On the contrary, \"king\" is a role given to someone, usually a ruler who possesses great power and authority.  So here we are dealing with a ruler who is from a lower social class.\n\nInput: Why do most dogs have an instinct to chase after cats? Choices:  I: Cat owners are quicker and easier than dogs II: Faster dogs can't catch up with a cat III: Cat owners are smaller and easier for dogs to find IV: Cats are easy to hunt because they sneak up on their prey\nRationales: In this question, first we need to understand the two animals. Cats are predators and dogs are prey, so generally speaking a dog will likely chase after a cat to escape its natural predator.\n\nInput: How do most birds hunt? Choices:  The birds sit on a limb watching carefully for animals walking below The birds swoop and attack from above The birds sit still in wait until the animal comes close enough to attack\nRationales:\n\nInput: How does the sun feel when you walk in the street at night?

Choices:  C: salmon A: bread B: cheese D: crab E: milk\nRationales:  1. In this question, there are two things to look to identify the correct choice.\n2. Since the first part of the question asks 'What kind of food'? We can infer that there is a single option that can be chosen as the right choice.\n3. Next, the question asks \"has a punch line, or what it is?\"\n4. Here, the choice needs to be that describes what a punch line is.\n5. So, the answer we'd expect to see is an item that has a punch line or what it is as a food. \n6. Since there's no logical combination of multiple items describing a punch line, the answer will be in one item only.\n7. So, the first thing to look for is that there can only be a single choice which is, \"C: salmon\"\n\nInput: Answers were being chosen one by one in a conference room. Why were choices not made simultaneously? Choices:  B: time C: schedule D: list E: calendar\nRationales:     1. There were choices being chosen, one by one in a room.\n2. It is because they were not made simultaneously.\n3. Since we now have a choice, we can look at the options to determine which of the six is not applicable in this context.\n4. The reason why choices are not being made simultaneously is because they are being chosen one by one while the answers, or choices are being listed or named, or scheduled, according to the context of the question.\n5. This means that the \"list\" or \"calendar\", \"schedule\", and \"calendar\" choices are viable and appropriate to be the choice that applies the most.\n6. We can further look at these four to see which one matches best with the context - \"list\", \"schedule\", \"calendar\", \"list\".\n7.

Choices: A: helicopter B: jet C: airliner D: truck E: wagon\nRationales: The question revolves around a crane. The crane picks up apples which just fell to the ground. The apples are being delivered by what?\n1. If the question were asking what apples are being delivered then the correct answer would most likely be the answer from one of the options: B, C, D or E.\n2. However, the question is asking what is delivering or using the crane.\n3. 'A: helicopter', since it has rotary blades and can transport heavy loads is the best answer.\nAnswer: B : helicopter\n\nInput:  It takes a trained eye to see some of what is present in the picture. Choices:  The train has broken down Choices:  A train driver B a locomotive engineer C a rail worker D a rail employee E a railway worker\nRationales: Train: It takes a trained eye can refer to the picture. The question has been presented.\n1. 'Trained eye' refers to seeing specific images or features.\n2. 'broken down' suggests there are images which require an eye that is trained.\n3. 'Travel with a train' has been identified with 'broken down'.\n4. 'Railway employee' may be considered an answer, however they may not have a trained eye and the picture has been identified to be 'broken down'. They may not have seen something, which means they do not have a trained eye.\n5. Hence, the answer to the question is 'Train driver' as it requires a trained eye and is the most appropriate.\n\n### Rewards:\n\n> \u2611\ufe0f Complete the assignment below.\n\n```python\nqs = ['An intricate machine?

Choices: 1: by standing on a moving bus 2: by taking a bus to a bus driving school 3: by falling off of a moving bus 4: by taking a bus driver course 5: from a bus driver manual\nRationales: Looking at the options, we can see that each one of them has a distinct possibility as a way to learn to drive.\n1. Option 1 implies learning to drive by standing on a moving vehicle and riding it. This is not a common way to learn to drive a bus.\n2. Option 2 indicates that the learner would find a bus to a driving school. This assumes they already know how to drive buses.\n3. Option 3 suggests they might learn to drive from falling off a moving bus.\n4. Option 4 is learning to drive from a bus driver course. This assumes they know how to drive vehicles and that learning how to drive a bus would be something they'd learn in a course.\n5. Option 5 is learning from a bus driver manual, which might not likely work, as learning how to drive a vehicle normally requires practice and hands-on experience.\n6. All the options except option 3 describe something that could work as a means of learning to drive a bus, so this option is not suitable.\n7. Option 3 is the only one that is obviously ridiculous or unlikely, so this is what the options should be narrowed down to, leaving us with option 3.\n8. Therefore, option 3 is the best answer, meaning that learning to drive a bus could likely be from falling off a moving vehicle.\nAnswer: D; falling off of a moving vehicle.\n\nInput: If we're thinking about what?

The problem statement gives context for the description of the lone sailor which pertains to him feeling utterly and completely helpless.\n2. Because of this state of helplessness, the sailor expected what?\n3. There can be many answers to this problem statement, but most appropriate would be \"dead\".\n4. If a lone sailor is helpless, dead is almost the only conclusion one can draw.\n5. Hence, the answer must be either D: saved, E: safe, or F: dead (one of them should be correct as one has to be saved or safe).\n\nHence, we can eliminate B: shark infected since it does not make sense a lone sailor at sea surrounded by water, will end up becoming shark infected.\n\nAgain, we must remove A: drowned as the sailor is helplesses.\n\nThis leaves us with either C: dead or F: dead.\n\nHence, D or E is an acceptable answer.\n\nAnswer: D or E (depending on if you would prefer one of two same answers)\n\n### Tip:\n1.

Detrimental effect on member does not fit the context, as group decided to do something \"because the people believed that the group's action will\" have. III. This option is too general, it has no direct reference to the question. IV. The group is doing something together, so \"group will do it together\" is correct choice. V.

Choices:  C: boss's office D: conference room E: kitchen F: cafeteria \nRationales: The sentence: \"If the boss was away/out of the office...\" means that someone knows where the boss is, not that the boss is not in the office. This sentence is a hint that the boss will not be near people he is working with. Based on this, we can conclude that the boss is away from the office and not in the office. If he is not in his office, where would he be present? This question is about the places the boss can be. The first two given choices: \"conference room\" and \"kitchen\" do not fit the question, because the first one is not part of an office and the second one is related to the cafeteria, which also is part of the office.

Choices: \tB: story C: book D: article E: history\nRationales:\t1. The question presents the context of a teacher suggesting that a student deserved a good lecture. This implies the boy was probably misbehaving or doing something which was inappropriate.\n2. Generically, a lecture is a speech or formal address which usually conveys some degree of knowledge or wisdom.\n3. Therefore, the teacher's suggestion indicates that he believed the boy was not doing a good job and deserves to hear some wisdom or knowledge in a formal setting.\n4. While the other terms may contain some wisdom or knowledge, they do not have a formal setting.\n5. The only possible matching choice is 'E: history', since a historical lecture would imply a formal setting with a teacher talking about some facts.\n6. Therefore the teacher meant the boy got a lecture because he deserved one, due to improper behavior, and this indicates the boy deserved a 'history' lecture.\nAnswer: E:'history'\n\nInput: A spray can of paint costs 1000 dollars, where might you find it?

We can quickly eliminate a 'bathroom', a 'bathroom' 'kitchen' or a 'garage' since they are not places where anyone would most likely find a can of paint.\n3. 'Yard' - While it is possible, this location may not be ideal and might require the can to be stored somewhere else in order to protect it from environmental factors which may reduce its quality.\n4.

The statement we are asked to choose \"What's the correct word for\" is \"car engine\".\n2. Considering the options available, we have four options that are pertaining to the temperature. Therefore, we need to determine what temperature.\n3. Given two temperature units (degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit) in the options available, the correct unit need to be found to eliminate the other wrong options. \n4. According to the degree Celsius units, the highest temperature is 100 degrees Celsius and the lowest is 0 degrees Celsius.\n5. As for the degrees Fahrenheit units, the lowest is -45 degrees Fahrenheit but the highest is 302 degrees Fahrenheit.\n6. Considering the correct units, we can see that in both the temperature units, 100 degrees is the highest temperature and 250 degrees is the lowest.\n7. As our initial word is 250 degrees, we can eliminate all the other choices except D: 20 degree and A: 25 degrees.\n8.

Where should someone get the idea to make this? Choices: \n A: book B: table C: kitchen D: refrigerator E: garbage\nRationales:\n1. The statement that the chef knew there was no receipt that could possibly produce the meal he was preparing indicates that the meal cannot be created according to an established recipe. \n2. So, the meal that the chef was creating could not be generated by following a written or published recipe.\n3. This creates an interesting question: Could we make the meal if we knew what ingredients were needed? If so, where should we look for the list of ingredients?\n4. Analyzing the choices, we find that two of the options are about what the chef was preparing - book and kitchen.\n5. In other words, we could find the details of what was needed by analyzing what the chef was prepar meal and the location where he is making it.\n6. But we cannot get the ingredients from a table (A: book) or a refrigerator (E: garbage).\n7. So, what's left?\n8. The garbage is the right answer because the garbage is where people discard meals.\n9. We can look in the garbage the next time the chef prepares something new and determine what ingredients were used for it.\n10. This provides a reasonable solution for the information and ingredients problem we are asked about. \n11. Therefore, the answer to the question would be either A: Book or E: Garbage.\n12. However, considering the meal is unconventional and perhaps new, the appropriate option is not A: book but E: garbage.\n13. Hence, the correct answer is E: Garbage\n\nInput: What happens if you take a pencil and place it on its point so everything falls in?

Choices A: swashbuckling B: chatter C: fun D: screaming E: eating F: sprinting\nRationales: The question states you always have a great time with a yacht because there's a lot of _____. 1. We want an answer that answers the question. In this case, the answer should show you the word with which you will always have a great time when on the yacht. 2. Swashbuckling is an answer that is not a good choice because you would not always have a great time swashbuckling. 3. If you are swashbuckling, you would be engaged in a dangerous activity that would lead to you not always having fun. 4. Chatter is a very good alternative choice because it means a lot of talk; you will always have a lot of talk with people when on a yacht. 5.

Choices: A: songs B: concerts C: movies D: operas E: videos\nRationales: Since the question refers to a great musician who played on his piano, we will have to figure out what can be played on a piano; options A, B, C, D, and E all fall under this umbrella and are therefore legitimate answers.\nOption A:'songs' would suggest that he was a vocalist. However, the answer to the question refers to playing on a piano, which would not suit somebody who played songs. \nOption B: 'concerts' is the concerts on the whole but since the question refers to his piano, it is not the correct answer.\nOption C:'movies' suggests the great musician was a cinema and motion picture player, which is not the context of the question. \nOption D: 'operas' are also operas in general. So, it is not an applicable answer since the question refers to that which the musician played on his piano.\nOption E: 'videos' are videos in general, the musician could have been a video player, and hence it is the correct answer. \nAnswer: E: videos\n\nInput: Why is a toaster a kitchen utility?

Choice C is wrong because the toaster heats only some foods, not all the foods in the kitchen.

Choices:  (A) They could not understand the questions. (B) They were confused because they didn't want to be. (C) They didn't know the answer. (D) They had trouble sleeping at night. (E) They didn't want to move.\nRationales: It's very obvious that the horses confused were not because they could not understand questions, and option B is incorrect; they were confused because they didn\u2019t want to be (i.e. they were unwilling, not confused).\n1. Option C is also invalid for the following reasons:\n    1. In the context, the horse is not being asked a question.\n2. As for option D, it can\u2019t be true because horses can\u2019t sleep.\n3. If horses can sleep, and if B is also a truth (i.e. the horses are confused because they don\u2019t want to be), it means they were confused because they don\u2019te want to be, which is contradictory.\n2.

Choices: A: their bedroom B: their house C: their nest D: their home E: their den\nRationales:  1. We know by definition that a rat's territory or 'home' is a location they claim and protect from intruders.\n2. We also know that rats do a lot by their territory because they constantly search for food, and in the wild spend most of their lives looking for food.\n3. So, the rats have to get to their 'home' to do what we know about them, which is to search for food and protect it.\n4. Therefore, to reach their 'home' to search for food and to protect it, they have to get to their nest.\n5. The nest, as an anatomical structure is an underground chamber made up of soil, twigs, etc. The term 'nest' also implies a more secluded or protected location from the outdoors.\n6. Coming back to our question, we know that rats have to get into their nest to search for food and guard it, so the nest is the right answer.\nAnswer: nest.\n\nInput: What do you do if you're out of petrol?

Choices:  D: soak it in vinegar B: leave some dry C: cook it in water D: add milk E: put it in a cold place\nRationales: The question asks \"What should you do before eaten rice?\" The given choices provide various ways by which they could potentially perform this action.\n1. Option \"D: add milk\" is not an appropriate answer as the purpose of adding milk before cooking rice appears to be contrary to the purpose it fulfils when done right after cooking.\n2. Similarly, option \"E: put it in a chilly place\" is unsuitable since it would be done before cooking rice. One should not put the rice in a cold place before cooking.\n3. Option A: \"leave some dry\" seems to mean leaving the rice underdone. The purpose of cooking rice would be lost if one leaves it partially cooked when eating the food.\n4. Option B: \"cook it in water\" is somewhat confusing as it doesn't make sense. Cooking water does not mean cooking rice in it. Instead option B probably should have been 'Add some water'.\n5. Option C: \"soak it in vineger\" is a viable option. It appears to be describing the correct procedure by prescribing the action of soaking in vinegar before cooking the rice.\n6. Therefore the correct answer to the question is C: soak it in Vinegar.\nAnswer: C. soak it in Vinagur\n\nInput: Many Americans have never been to Europe and do not plan to. What is the main point?

Choices: !#: A: back B: front C: top D: bottom E: park\nRationales:!#: The question is asking where your car can be seen. The question is pretty straightforward. There are several locations in which your car can be seen, and there are also some specific locations that will be better for watching one's car.\n1. Option A: 'back': 'back' is not the correct answer because it means you can always be back of an object, for example a car. It is redundant, the object can still be seen when viewed from the back.\n2. Option B: 'front': 'front' is not the correct option because this can mean the front of an object. It does not specify which side of an object to be seen from. Moreover, most vehicles are viewed from the front, and we would go to 'back' for different views, which this question does not allow.\n3. Option C: 'top': It could be true but we can specify this in the question. This is not the best answer to the question, we could also be seeing a car top from any side so we need to specify.\n4. The options D & E are redundant and therefore could be both removed. The car front can be seen from the front car park and vice versa, so we do not need both options.\n5. Thus, the most appropriate answer for the question is E: 'park'. This option has the advantage of specifying the location as a car park.\nAnswer: E!#: park\n\nInput: When a plane gets shot it means a bullet has come too close, who shot it?

Choices: A: below 0 B: smaller than the smallest data C: larger than the largest data D: either answer could be true E: larger than the mean\nRationales: We need to determine exactly what information is missing that this question is asking. \n1. Option C: 'larger than the largest data'. In case of an odd study with an odd number n, our sample data n would include n-1 outlying observations. In this scenario, it is possible that the median or mean of the group may be greater than the largest of the observations, and the median could be equal to the largest value.\n        In this context \"larger than the largest value\" is not a statement which is true.\n2. Option B. 'Smaller than the second smallest data'. This option does not tell us whether the data is above or below the second smallest of the data observations. \n        In the context of even number in statistics, the median is equal to the second smallest of the observations, so not a statement which is not true.\n2. The given options do not suggest whether the mean will be less or greater than the median in the given data. But Option D does address that. It tells us that the statement is about the mean.\n          This statement is not true always. The mean can be larger or lower than the median. There is no guarantee which one it might be in the given statistical study.\n3. Option B would be the most suitable if we are asked about the median.\n4.

Choices: A: sugar B: sweet C: cream D: decaffienated E: strong\nRationales: The question is asking that we should make the coffee black.\n1. When coffee is made without any modifications, the coffee is said to be black or regular.\n2. We shouldn't make the coffee regular.\n3. So, the answer would be a variation of 'decaffeinated'.\n4.

Choices: A) going too slow B) moving with a big crowd C) taking too much time D) I'm slowing down E) walking too fast\nRationales:1. The question is a sentence with many phrases and clauses.\n2. Some of the items in the question may not be relevant at this time,\n3. so we should identify the key points and choose the word that fits with each point in the sentence.\n4. The sentences are, I want to make you _______, I want to make certain that you _____, I want to make confident that you _______.\n5. The last two sentences are independent of the first sentence.\n6. Therefore 'how can I make' cannot refer to the previous sentence.\n7. Since, the word 'I' refers to the person in the latter clause.\n8. Thus, the person in question is making sure or making certain or making confident to the individual to whom the questions is addressed.\n9. So, this word is not related to a person or people or things in the same context.\n10. So, it is not 'on me'.\n11. One such suitable expression might be 'happening to me'.\n12.

Choices: A: outside B: company C: university D: job E: market\nRationales: The question revolves around what the boss said about how he wanted an employee.\nFrom the sentences, it's evident that the boss looked for one outside the job market, since this is where the job market is. This means the boss looked outside company hiring options, university recruitment programs, and job markets.\nTherefore, we are left with two options that are not the place where the boss said he wanted/looked for an employee.\nA: outside and B: company.\nIn this situation, we know that outside is a place where one can possibly find employees, but not from the boss. Similarly, an employee working for a company does not count as the boss looking for an employee for his company.\nMoreover, recruitment programs/job markets do not exist separate from their parent companies. If they're from the company, they would be a part of it, instead of being independent programs that the boss goes through.\nE: market does not belong to the job market.\n\nThe only valid and meaningful choice will be E: university since this place would give the boss more options and options that are more likely to succeed from his perspective.\n\nAnswer: E: university\n\nInput and Output: What were the 3 main parts of the lecture?

Choices:   A: match B: sports C: championship D: camp E: tournament\nRationales: This question is about a team, probably a sports team. The team became ill but is still fit for the rest of its activities.\n1. For the ill teammates, we have to decide if there's any location or space that they're no longer allowed/capable of being in.\n2. Match, sports, championship, camp, tournament, all seem to be activities or events for which team members could be competing/participating.\n3. If the word fit is used instead of ability, it would mean all the ill teammates have recovered and are able to resume normal function.\n4. Since this isn't the case, we can eliminate option D (camp); since it's an activity, and the sick team members are no longer allowed to be there.\n5. We know that the sick ones didn't recover enough to resume the full schedule of activities (e.g. matches).\n6. Option E (tournament) makes the most sense since it's most likely to be a tournament that's affected; since the sick team members are still ill, even though they are able to do something, they are not allowed, since that something is a tournament.\nAnswer: E tournament\n\nInput: The dog was barking outside my window, it really woke me.

Looking at the options, if we ask what was the vegetable purchased by the tourists, there are three options that can potentially take that role (A: broccoli, B: zucchinn C: eggplant) and one that cannot (D: carrots) (E: Asparagus).\nTherefore, if we look at the options that can potentially be the vegetable, (A) 'broccoli' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: A. broccoli\n\nInput: The woman wore several necklaces to work.

In fact, a book can remain for sale even after the copyright of the book expired.\n3. \nColleges are institutions providing an academic environment. A college has nothing to do with bookstores or book sales.\n4. \nSchools are places where you can sell books, both new and sometimes used books, i.e. second-hand books. School bookstores typically sell books and other related accessories.\n\n5.\nLibraries are places with a large number of old and current books alike. Therefore, this option is a possibility but not a must given the options and the context of the story.\n\nHence, the only option that remains is a \"School\".\n       \nAnswer: D: school\n\n### Exercise: \n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n### Demonstraction:\nInput: Where would someone take a dog?

Choices:  B: back yard C: garage D: neighborhood  E: highway F: driveway  G: near by\nRationales: This is a very basic statement implying that the car was parked some distance away from the driver. The question refers to the context of where one commonly parks a car.\n6. A car is parked for many reasons such as leaving it for a long drive away from home, or temporarily parking it in a neighborhood parking lot for convenience.\n7. Option B: back yard is not common for cars generally as this is a location that is usually used for personal vehicles.\n8. Car parking is much more common in the garage and other places like a driveway.\n9. Hence, the answer will be C: garage and D: driveway.\nAnswer: C; garage and D; driveway.\n\nInput: The doctor has an uncommon bedside manner.\n\nRationales:\n\n2. Doctor's bedside manner is a term used to describe how the doctor treats patients. \n3. It is often defined in terms of a doctor's communication skills and emotional intelligence. \n4. It does not indicate anything about where a doctor may perform physical examinations. \n5. Only \"The bed\" can refer to both a place and a physical object. \n6. Therefore, only \"The bed\" can make sense in the sentence. \n7. The bedside manner can be implied in any hospital or clinic. \n8. Therefore, the correct answer is \"The bed.\"\n\nAnswer: The bed.\n\nInput: Which side of the house has the better view, the front or the back? Choices: A: front B: back C: top D: bottom E: interior F: garden G: ground\nRationales: Each of the choices provided refers to aspects of the house itself. \nThe key is identifying which aspect of the house is most relevant to the view referred to in the question. \nWe can eliminate the interior of the house (which would be the inside), as that would not be a", "answer": "E: breathe deeply"}

Choices:  C: cowardly B: confident E: fearful D: scared B: boastful A: untrustworthy\nRationales: This question seems to want us to infer whether or not the lion is a coward, bravely boastful, or a wimp.\n1. We can use our knowledge of common lion character traits to get a rough idea of what the lion might be.\n2. For example, a cowardly lion will not roar loudly.\n3. Or a confident lion will do so.\n4. On the other hand and for the same reason, a scared lion will also roar loudly. Likewise, the other options do not match the description.\n5. We need to keep in mind that for a lion not to roar loudly, they would need to be fearful. That way, the lions roar makes it clear how 'confident' or'scared' they are.\n6. We also know that while confident lions will roar loudly, wimpy lions also do not roar at all.\n7. Thus, options B: boastful and A: untrusting are unlikely choices as the lion cannot roar to assert confidence or scare away prey in these situations.\n8. Therefore, the answer here is C: cowardly.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: Where should an aquarium be kept that requires a low-humidity situation and does not require high energy input? Choices:  B: bathroom D: dining room E: hallway F: kitchen G: balcony A: attic\nRationales: The question is asking where an aquarium should be kept. We can see this from the phrases 'a low humidity situation and' and 'does not require high energy input'. \n1. A fish tank or aquarium requires proper care and management, including providing an environment with low humidity", "answer": "E: apartment"}

Choices: 1. A: potato salad 2. B: pot holders 3. C: spoons 4. D: lamps 5. E: candlesticks\nRationales:1. The question states that a wood lathe can be made into something.\n2. The options presented include potato salad, pot holders, spoons, lamps, and candlesticks.\n3. We can eliminate 'potato salad', 'candlesticks', and 'lamp'.\n3. This leaves us with 'pot holders','spoons', and 'punch holders'.\n4. The problem statement only states that the outcome needs to be'made', so the answer cannot be an 'idea', an 'ability', or a 'concept'.\n5. All the three options provide a material object, so we can choose this among the options.\n6. Hence the answer is C: Sponses\nAnswer: C; Sponses\n\nInput: In which season do kumquats grow? Choices: 2:A: fall B: summer C: winter D: spring\nRationales:2. We can eliminate the option stating that kumquats are grown in the winter.\n3.

The context is of solar eclipse and the keyword is \"protection.\" From the available choices, 'handkerchief', 'flippers', and'swim masks' are not suitable choices as they can't be worn, even if they are in proximity of the body.\n2. As for 'goggle', the eye wear is the best answer and is the correct choice. So, it's E: goggled goggles.\n3. But'sun glasses and swim masks' are more than just sun glasses and they aren't goggles. Therefore, we choose D. goggles with a sun glass shade.\nAnswer: D.goggles with a shades\n\n### Input: The new company will work in what direction? Choices: 1: east 2: north 3: west 4: south 5: none of the above\n\nRationales Choices: The question contains the information that the new company will work in which direction and that they are a new company. So, the candidate should eliminate the statements that are not related to the company, in this case, \"None of the above\". For the remaining options, the candidates have to analyze the information about their own direction and the context of the situation as well. If the company is new, it would logically work in any direction; west or south or north or east.\n\nWe don't need to consider the case where the company has worked in the past. So, \"North\" or \"South\" can be eliminated in this case. In fact, \"South\" cannot be eliminated completely, as that option may make sense in the context of the question.\n\nSo, we are left with either options 1 or 3. Given that the context of the question is a new company in any direction, option 3 \"Working in West\" is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: 3.Working in West", "answer": "C: space center"}

Choices:  F: the bird is injured A: the person is watching B: the bird is sick C: the person is walking D: the person is uncomfortable\nRationales: The question asks us to assess the meaning of a bird hop sideways using the given options.\nAll the choices are statements about how, why, and where animals or people might be found.\n1. Option A: \"The person is walking\" can be used interchangeably with the choice \"the person is standing\".\n2. Option C: \"The person is uncomfort\" can also be said as \"the person is feeling uncomfortable\".\n3. With all the other choices remaining intact, the choices A and C may or may not be logical as an explanation for the bird's motion.\n4. However with B: \"The bird is sick\", since the explanation and action \"the bird is sick\" is the reason behind the bird hops sideways, this seems to be the most logical option.\n5. This congruency of choices with question statements results into two choices - B: the bird is unwell, or B: the person is walking.\n6. As walking is something animals may also do, we can eliminate option B: \"the person is walking\", and it gets reduced to two options only - B: the bird sick, and A: the person is standing.\n7. We need to eliminate an option that does not make sense.\nOption A: \"The person\" may or may not be in a position \"to stand\", this is still subjective based on the perspective for \"the person\" given.\n8. Thus, \"the bird sick\" is a more logical option, that explains and justifies the bird's motion, that is a sideways hop. It seems to fit", "answer": "D: parking garage"}

Choices: A: serene B: crowded C: calm D: hushed E: loud\nRationales: One is to note that the library is a typical environment for reading. We can also surmise that'reading' is a noisy task. In addition,'reading' is a task that requires silence (though it is a task that depends solely on context).\n1. Given this, Option A:'serene' provides an ideal description of the reading area in the library. Serene is the most descriptive option in the alternatives given.\n2. Option B: 'crowded' is the opposite of serene. It implies 'crowded area' in the library.\n3. Option C: 'calm' can be found in library as well because it does not necessarily indicate 'crowded area'.\n4. Option D: 'hushed' can be found in the library, for example, when reading at the library.\n5. Option E: 'loud' is the opposite of'serene' and 'hushed'. 'Loud' is the opposite.\nAnswer: A : serene\n\nInput: What might be found in a place where there is a pool table? Choices: A : pool cues B : table C : chairs D : beers E : dartboards\nRationales:\n1. Let us analyze the problem statement. The problem statement asks what can be found or what objects might be present in/ at a place where there is (a) pool table.\n2.\nAnalyzing the possible objects and places available to us, here, we can deduce that the list of possible objects could be A: pool cues, B: table, C: chairs, D: beers, E: dartboards.\n3.\nIn order to deduce the correct answer, let us analyze each choice.\n4.\nPool cues.\ni.\tThe words \"in a place where there is\" in the question implies that pool cues are not always present in the place where a pool table", "answer": "A: train station"}

Choices: 1. It was too risky 2. It may lead to fire 3. It cannot protect the car from breakins 4. It is not secure, choose the closest statement 5. It is a poor shelter for the vehicle\nRationales:  1. The question is about keeping a car, not about leaving it in an unlocked location that is not a shelter of any sort.\n2. The four previous statements indicate why it's considered bad to keep cars in tunnels.\n3. They each focus on safety risks that exist for keeping a car in a tunnel.\n4. The previous four choices all discuss possible negative outcomes that can occur with keeping a car in a tunne.\n5. The question wants the choice that best matches the last option that's discussed about tunnels.\n6. As a result, we know that the other four outcomes were not ideal with a car kept in a tunnel. The final statement, that it is 'not secure', applies to protecting the car from breakins, which is the only possible outcome remaining.\n7. Hence the correct answer is 5: It is not secure.\nAnswer: 5: It is insecure\n\nInput: Where can you find an alligator outside of the united states?

Analyzing the given choices, the options that don't exist outside the united states would be Australia, China, Japan, and Mexico.\n2. This leaves us with Canada and the United Kingdom.\n3. However, while both Canada and the UK are included in the countries outside the united states, we can infer that there is more than one possible answer for the question.\n4. This means that the question is not referring to the presence of alligators in either of those countries in general, but something specific.\n5.

When he discovered that his daughter had become a doctor, he couldn't help expressing how proud he was of her. She said her medical studies made her more like what? Choices: A: a scientist B: a scholar C: a man D: a human E: a woman\nRationales: After reading the statement thoroughly, consider each of the choices individually.\n1. The only two words that are associated with either of the two words \"proud\" or \"scientist\" are \"man\" and \"woman\". The sentences don't associate any more specifics in relation to \"scientist\".\n2. Thus, we must make an assumption regarding the answer.\n\nThe most viable question here is \"what else does \"man\" and \"scientist\" have in common other than that they are both genders?\n3. \"Man\" and \"woman\" are both genders and only include humans. All other animals in the world are incapable of being either \"man\" or \"woman\". Thus, the correct answer is B: a scholar because a'man' and a 'woman' relate to both human beings.\nAnswer: B : a scholar\n\nInput: The man explained how to stop unwanted ads appearing on his computer. He said that it might be helpful to what? Choices: The first word of each sentence is highlighted.

It is important to note that the sentences only list \"How to stop unwanted ad's appearing on a computer\" and nothing else.\n2. Although the phrase \"on his computer\" suggests that the question could apply to computers in general, it doesn't provide for the case with other devices.\n3. Thus, the correct answer to this question is E: block any online adverting.\nAnswer: E. block any online advertising", "answer": "D: back and"}

Choices:  B: right A: East D: all directions C: South E: left\nRationales: This question is regarding the directions of movement a ballet dancer can make most if using their legs.\n1. Considering the options, we are given directions like north, east, south, west, and left. However, we know that ballet dancers can't dance in east.\n2. In the same way, a ballet dancer has to be facing someone to dance. This would mean they can't move in directions like west and south.\n3. The rest of the directions could be considered if the dancer doesn't have to pay attention to who they are facing and are able to move without any obstruction in their front, back, or sides.\n4. This leaves us with only two options: east or right.\n5. East and right both have the least obstruction from other people or directions, meaning their dances would be able to get noticed the most.\n6. Hence, the answer to this question is B: right.\nAnswer: B right\n\nInput: In what way is the tendency of someone to trust different than their tendency to believe? Choices:  D: emotion E: honesty B: truth A: opinion F: thought\nRationales: A sentence is given with two terms, 'tendency' and 'trust'. Therefore, we need to find a way in which they are opposite.\n1. One major difference that could be found is that you trust something or someone, but you don't believe in it.\n2. This could either mean that: (A) you trust someone, but you believe they will stab you in the back, or (B) you trust something because you can't believe that they will betray you.\n3. The first case can be considered 'trusting despite doubting'. Hence, the answer to the question is 'trusting despite doubt'.\nAnswer: Trusting despite doubt\n\nInput: Which of the following is different from'shut down'? Choices:", "answer": "B: motel room"}

Choices:  B: a cat  C: a mouse  D: a goldfish  E: a fish.\nRationales: The problem statement says the answer refers to something that is \"very unlikely to be able to do something\".\nThe context makes it clear that the activity this phrase refers to is \"going without sleep.\"\nTherefore, looking at the options, we can identify that 'a mouse', 'a goldfish', and 'a fish' would be unlikely to \"go without sleep.\"\nThis eliminates options B, C, and D.\nFor the remaining option (E), a \"goldfish\" cannot go without sleep.  They can survive without any food or water for up to one and a half months and even longer than that with minimal or no food for several days.\nTherefore, the only option we are left with is E.\nThe answer is E: a goldfish.\nAnswer: E.\n\n\nInput: People were able to make their way through a swamp by using sticks.  What do they call these sticks? Choices:  l: ropes  m: fishing poles  n: paddles  o: canes  p: branches\nRationales: A problem statement can include a sentence that indicates what a 'thing' is called or known as. Here in the examples, the sentence \"People used sticks to get through a swamp\" gives us the name of the sticks that they used to get through the swamp. So they should be called sticks.\nSo looking at the given options, each option includes a name that the \"sticks\" are called and so, according to the problem statement the words chosen from each option must be the names given to \"sticks\" in order to pass this question.\nThe only option that includes names of objects that a person uses to use and get through a swamp is \"n\", which contains the name of the object \"paddle\", so the answer is \"n\" as the correct one, from the given choices.\nAnswers: \n\nInput: You were looking through the woods, where did you see two men?

Choices:  a: cave b: zoo c: den d: safari e: prison\nRationales:  \n1. The question asks where the tiger escaped from. \n2. We know that a tiger is a wild animal. \n3. A tiger in the wild is rarely kept in a safari or zoo (especially on its own, as it seems from context that some people are also there in the zoo). So, most probably it would have escaped from a cage in a zoo or a den in an enclosure.\n4. From the options, a, c and e seem unlikely given the context. Only a, c and e refer to enclosures and places that could potentially be kept a caged or a denned animal.\n5. 'a: cave' also seems unlikely. Caves would most likely house some other animal, like a bat.\n6. b: zoo and d: safari seem too specific because they do not offer clues to the question. They are places where you could see tigers and are not necessarily where the tiger is escaping from.\n7. So it must be c or e. 'Prison', does not make sense.\n8. Given the context and clues, the most suitable options are 'a: cave' and 'e: prison'.\n9. Since both 'a: cave' cannot be the option, option 'e: prison' is the correct answer.\n10. The answer must be E: prison.\n\nInput: What kind of animals do people eat in England?

Not refers to some previous statement or action that's referred to as \"where customers could pick out their vehicle\".\nii. 2nd Clause: where any customers could pick.\na. This clause implies that at some point in the store, there was a place where customers could pick out their items.\niii. 3rd Clause: out.\na. This is an adverbal phrase that indicates that \"customers\" is a noun phrase.\nb. It is a phrase that modifies a verb. In this case, the verb is \"could pick\".\niv. 4th Clause: out their petrol.\na. At some point in time or place, petrol was to be picked by customers.\nb. Hence, there was once a place where customers could get their petrol.\nv. 5th Clause: Petrol\na. This clause specifies the actual item or noun (singular) that customers used to pick out and get to their vehicle.\nvi. 6th Clause: place.\na. A place is needed for the customers to go to their vehicle and pick out the petrol themselves.\nb.

In other words, we had a place where customers could go to pick out their petrol and customers were required to go to that place on their own to pick out petrol so that they could travel later (as the question implies). In other words, it's a necessity to have a place for the custom pick-up.\nvii. 7th Clause: where.\na. This sentence structure indicates where the place for customer pick-out is.

Choices:  E: they do not eat prey  B: they do not eat meat  A: they do not eat other sharks  C: they may eat people  D: they may eat prey\nRationales: There are two reasons the word \"apex\" may be important in this. The first is that, in natural terms, an apex predator is something at the top of the food chain with no prey of their own. They are predators, but if there is nothing to eat below them, they are neither prey nor predatory (in an ecosystem sense, not as humans usually define \"predator\" or \"prey\").  The second reason is that we typically associate 'apex' to mean 'leading'. Therefore, something that is at the top has achieved a certain position in terms of power and influence, which is usually what we mean when we describe an object as being \"at the top.\"\nUsing this, we begin to eliminate answer choices. D, \"may eat prey\", doesn't make any sense as prey does nothing to influence predators; they are inert things whose primary function is to be consumed. If a predator may eat prey, they are not an apex predators. (Of course, the sharks may in fact choose to eat people, but they are not \"may\" in the conventional sense in response to these statements about their behavior). Similarly we can eliminate E: they do not take prey: as we noted they are \"apex predators\"; if they take prey, they're not apex predators at that point. B, \"they do not eat meat\" doesn't work because we're specifically talking about sharks, a subgroup of sharks, not just sharks in general, and a shark in general may (by our earlier logic) choose to eat certain items of prey which are meat. A, \"they do not take other sharks\" is contradicted by several apex predator characteristics: they don't eat prey, they do have", "answer": "E: may laugh"}

Choices: \n A: jaws B: underwater C: teeth D: jawbone E: deep ocean\nRationales. 1. The question refers to something sharks use, then asks where they might be found. Shark's have teeth, a jaw, jawbone, and mouths.\n2. If we consider where the teeth could be found, we would find in teeth, or a dentist's office.\n3. A shark's teeth, or even a mouth would definitely not be found in a dentist's or a jawbone would not likely be found in a fish tank.\n4. So we can effectively rule out A: jaws and E: deep ocean.\n5. D: jawbone is a possibility, but probably not for a tooth or teeth.\n6. As for B: underwater and C: teeth, teeth would be found in A: jaws and D: jawbone in B: underwater and D: jawbonr, both of which would not be found floating freely.\n7. Therefore we are left with only one option, C: teeth, since otherwise all other options are unlikely.\n8. The options can't be combined though, as they're mutually exclusive; a tooth can't be found in jawbone or the mouth or the dentist's office or underwater or be lost in the deep ocean.\n9.

The word 'past' implies prior to the 21st century or before the year 2000.\n2. From the choices provided, we can narrow down our options. 'Showerhead' and'sink' are too modern and belong to the 21 century. \n3. 'Toilet' implies that the king had to use the bathroom facility in the past.

Choices: A: slow B: hungry C: huge D: timid E: inconsistent\nRationales:  1. The question is about how a zebra ecological behavior.\n2. 'Zebra' is a specific animal and 'appetite' is an internal, biological need like feeding.\n3. From the options, we have 'eat' and 'huge'. We also need to factor in the animal's behavior and internal drives.\n4. 'Zebra eats'. A zebra is an herbivore which means it will always feed and eat. So, 'huge' would not be a logical choice as a zebra grows into adulthood.\n5. 'A: slow' and 'B: hungry' both allude to speed. Since it's not clear what the zebra's speed of eating would be, these two options are difficult to determine.\n6. 'C: huge'. This is a false answer as discussed above.\n7. 'D: timid'. Based on the assumption of knowledge of the zebra' internal state and needs, we can exclude this option as a potential correct answer.\n8. 'E: inconsistent' is the opposite of the original phrase \"It's difficult to tell\". So, it can be ruled out because it's not a correct response to the question.\n9.

We first determine the purpose of the sentence construction.  After identifying'school ground,' 'gymnasium,' and 'class' as possible options, we need to verify which of them serves the purpose of the question.\n1. Embarrassment is likely to occur in social situations. Based on the provided context, the setting is a formal one where adults have a large presence.\n2. The sentence implies that a social situation occurred in a particular place. This can be ruled out by'school ground'.\n3. A formal or adult setting would likely take place in a 'gymnasium'.\n4. A 'gymnasium' is typically a large indoor space and is similar in purpose to a 'classroom'.\n5. Since'moment' is used with 'defend', it is unlikely that the statement concerns protecting an immovable thing.\n6. Therefore 'classroom' and 'gym' are the most likely settings for the formal setting.\n7. Because 'gym' is more similar to a casual setting, we can infer that the setting may be a classroom. \n8. Hence, 'classroom' is the most likely place of the stated context.\nAnswer: C. Gymnasium\n\nInput: What's the word for the top-most part of a mountain?

Choices: B: leaf tree D: bird B: tree E: racket club\nRationales:1. The phrase \"bright beak\" describes the bird as having a colorful and bright beak. Thus, we can infer that the bird in question is a colorful or unique species of bird.\n2. The beak of a bird is associated with how food is foraged and obtained. So, the bird perching on the leaf tree indicates that it is a species that requires food from tree leaves.\n3. Since 'D: bird' is not a potential candidate, we know for sure that the bird we're looking for is not the same one being described as \"The bird had a bright beck\".\n4. With that, we can infer that option E: racket club is not the correct answer because it doesn't logically fit the context.\n5. We are left with options B, E and A. However, option A: 'leaf tree' is not very descriptive because the phrase doesn't provide what the leaf tree it refers to looks like.\n6. Option E: 'racket club' is not the answer either because racket clubs are not natural places where birds can land or perch to eat food.\n7. This leaves us with just one option, which is B: tree.\n8.

{"text": "ability to climb.\n7. Therefore,'E: tree' is correct.\nAnswer: E. tree\n\nInput: It is a good idea to keep something valuable away from what you do not want lost; this may prevent what? Choices: A: gaining something valuable  B: losing something valuable C: preventing a theft D: preventing a robbery E: preventing a vandalization\nRationales:1. The sentence contains a double negative. We don't need to worry about the meaning of the sentence because it is obvious that 'gaining something' doesn't mean 'taking something in possession.'\n2. Therefore, it is more likely that option 'A. gaining something' isn't the right answer and we need to focus on the other options.\n3. Looking at the rest of the options, we know that the thing being lost and the 'theft' or 'robbery' are the wrong options as they do not answer what it is that is prevented from happening.\n4. Furthermore, an individual may not want to lose something, but that does not ensure that it isn't a possibility. But we know that the robbery is avoided.\n5. Therefore we can say that option D: \"preventing a robbery\" is the correct answer because the thing that is lost is prevented from happening and robbery is a word that is consistent with prevention.\nAnswer: D Robbery\n\nInput: Which item has a large surface to area ratio?  Choices: A. towel B. pillow C. rug D. blanket E. sock\nRationales:  1. The question is looking for a statement that includes \"surface to area ratio\".\n2. This implies that the surface area of whatever item is being discussed, needs to be compared to its overall \"surface\" or flat or round surface area.\n3. Therefore, we can say that the object is not a flat surface or area in itself, but it needs to be related to the size of that flat area.\n4. This eliminates Option A: towel because we know that a towel is a flat, smooth surface, so it is not correct because the flat area is not relative to overall surface area.\n5. Similarly, this gets eliminated from Option C, rug, and Option E, sock.\n6. So the options", "answer": "E: artist's studio"}

Many of them went to the shopping centre.  What was the rest of the town doing? Choices:  Tick: A sleeping.  Not tick: B shopping B baking C baking C playing golf D playing golf E baking  F  sleeping F  baking G sleeping  G  shopping\nRationales: When you say that \"many of the teenagers\" \"all got together\" and \"spent it together\", you mean there were a lot. The sentence also says \"all\" got together and it only lists \"many\". What does this mean? One can only assume \"many\" is less than all, but this is not explicitly stated. So one must infer that \"many\" is less that all (because this is the only logically possible meaning of \"all got together\"). Also it was a day of fun. For it to be a day of fun for everyone, it has to mean that no one \"got together\" and spent the rest of their time doing something else (for the rest of their time, you can assume they are at home). So this means not \"got together\". What were they doing? They are not mentioned, so this implies they were not doing anything (sleeping, working, playing golf, shopping, etc). In this case it is logical to interpret \"many of the teeneagers\" as \"not all of the teenagers\". The word \"all\" means to refer to everything. So to refer to everything means that many things are not referring to everything. The thing that makes the most sense out of this is that \"many things\" are not \"playing golf\". To conclude, the most logical conclusion would be that they are not playing golf. It seems very unlikely that the town as a whole could be sleeping. Not only do you say \"many\" but you also say that the town as a collective \"went to the shopping centre\". So it's impossible that the town is both at the shopping centre while asleep. Now the only options left are \"sleeping\" and \"baking\". There is no other option left. So the correct answer must be \"sleeping\".\n\nInput: Which option is a", "answer": "D: injuries"}

Hence we infer that the most appropriate choice is E: 'tree'.\nAnswer: E: tree\n\nInput: The dog had to travel in many different directions; sometimes on the sidewalk, at other times the dog was allowed off what? Choices: Option A: street Option B: leash Option C: property Option D: foot Option E: side\nRationales: The statement states that the dog travelled in many different directions.  We also know that sometimes the dog is on the street, and other times the dog is allowed off the street.  We also know the dog is off the street sometimes and on the street other times. These facts could lead us to think that the dog is on a leash. The dog is not on a leash though, because the dog is allowed off. The dog is a dog and not a leash. The words \"sometimes on the sidewalk\" doesn't mean that the dog was a sidewalk. Sidewalks can't be dogs, but sometimes the dog is on a sidewalk.  The sentence also says that the dog is sometimes allowed to be on a sidewalk. Sidewalk is not a synonym for allowed to be on, but the dog is a dog. This tells us that the dog is not allowed to be a sidewalk. Another option could be that the animal may be allowed to walk somewhere on the street, but the dog is not a street.  The dog needs to travel in many different ways for the answers to be incorrect.  All of the options (C,D,E) are allowed to travel in different ways.  The dog can walk through a doorway, around a tree, or through a fence.  These are all allowed, but the dog is still in the same place, a house or a yard that is contained by a fence. The dog in and of itself, the entity is the dog and not an arrangement of buildings.  Option B gives the answer of \"off the sidewalk\" which does not correspond to the problem. There are many options of going off the sidewalk, some of which do not relate to location.

Choices:  D: learn how to ride horses A D: change the horses B: change the riders C: make horses smaller E: ride the horses differently\nRationales: Here we have a question that essentially asks for us to do an inference, or as to what needs to occur for horses to be easier to ride.\n1. The answer choices offer potential solutions to the difficulty in riding horses. We will identify what these are and then determine which one is most suitable.\n2. 'Change the horses' implies we need to somehow change horses so it is easier to ride, maybe make them smaller.\n3. 'Change the riders' does not make much sense in this context. The statement refers to 'how to ride horses'. If we were to change the riders, we would have to change how people are taught how to ride horses. This will not really solve the issue of difficulty in riding horses for us. This is a bad option.\n\n4. 'Make horses smaller' implies that they will be more manageable to ride. This helps us understand the issue, as larger horses tend to be more difficult to ride, and so this option is good.\n5. 'Ride the horses differently' refers to changing the way that people ride horses. While this is a solution to the difficulty of riding, it is not very specific to what we know about how to ride horses. Moreover, it sounds very vague, and, in fact, is a very generic method to apply to anything that is difficult. Therefore, this is also a bad option.\n6. 'Learn how to ride horses' is a very specific and helpful choice among the options.\n\nAnswer: C: make horses smaller\n\nInput: Raisins are tiny.  What are their relative volume?

Choices: \tA: corn B: milk C: cheese D: pears E: beans\nRationales: Analyze the options available and ask yourself what kind of food you would typically find calcium in.\n1. 'corn' does not have a nutritional component of calcium and is therefore not a viable answer.\n2. However,'milk' is a great option that would contain a high content of calcium among many other things.\n3. 'Cheese' is an excellent choice as it is made from cows' milk which would almost definitely be rich in calcium.\n4. 'pears' is not an ideal option either. Although we know that pears have calcium, it would not be very high and thus not a very feasible answer choice.\n5. Therefore the most appropriate answer is 'C: cheese'.\nAnswer: C: cheese\n\nInput: Which of these cars is the most fuel efficient? Choices  A: pickup B: minivan C: station wagon D: van E: jeep\nRationales: What do the options suggest in regards to the cars that the question describes?\n1. 'pickup' is a car designed for heavy payload and is certainly not efficient at fuel consumption. \n2.'minivan' is a large car and might be more fuel-efficient, but it is likely designed with many other vehicle features.\n3.'station wagon' seems to be more fuel-efficient than regular cars but is larger than a minivan.\n4. Finally, 'van' is the best choice as it is a minimalistic and basic vehicle, thus fuel-efficient.\n\nAnswer: E: van\n\nInput: While it is a common belief, what does not appear to be true about pigs is that they do not fly. Choices  A: pigs B: parrots C: ducks D: chickens E: sparrows.\nRationales: How might one best identify 'true' and 'not true' in this context?\n1. 'pigs', as noted, is not flying. It is true about pigs that they do not fly because they are large animals that cannot fly.\n2. 'parro", "answer": "D: cease fire"}

Choices: 1 A: ten pounds B: hundred pounds C: ten ounces D: one pound E: eleven ounces\nRationales:1. The problem statement asks us to complete the question based on the choices given.\n2. We know the unit of measurement for both pounds and kilograms are present in the options given.\n3. This makes the answer choices of (B: hundred pounds), (C: ten ounces), and (D: one pound) wrong because none of them is a gram unit.\n4. The unit of choice for both pounds and kilos must correspond. So we can rule out both these choices.\n5. Choice A (ten pounds) is wrong because it would come to $400 or more.\n6. Since $4200 is not given as an option as an answer, it can be rejected.\n7. We are left with only option E (ten ounces) as a valid answer.\nAnswer: A. Choice E: Ten ounces\n\nInput: Do you have any fruit? Choices:  (B: Some candy) is not an option because it does not offer fruit. The answer is E: Some fruit; A: some fruit is too specific. B: No candy is not an option since it does not indicate if the speaker already has some candy. D: Fruit is incorrect because \"Do you have\" indicates that the speaker doesn't already have any fruit. C: Fruit is not incorrect because \"Do you\" means that the speaker doesn' answer is either yes or no.\nRationales: The problem statement asks us the answer from the choices listed.\n1. Option A: \"Some fruit\" is too specific and can be rejected.\n2. B and D are not options because neither suggests that some fruit is available.\n3. Option C: \"Fruit\" is incorrect because the verb pattern indicates that the speaker doesn\u2019t answer with a Yes/No response.\n4. Therefore, the answer will be B: No candy because this indicates that some fruit is available in the speaker\u2019s home\nAnswer: E: Some Fruit\n\nInput: I will buy the sweets if", "answer": "A: seaside town"}

Less than a hundred dollars C. More than a hundred dollars D. Thousands E. Dozens\nRationales:\n1. First, analyze the sentence structure and context to determine what or who the phrase \"the cheeky waiter\" refers.\n2. Considering the first option: D. Thousands; 'thousands' is too much for 'the cheeky wait' to hide from the owner.\n3. Consider whether the hidden money is from a large amount or a small amount.\n4. Option E. Dozens is an unreasonable guess because it refers to a specific amount.\n5. Therefore we have option B. Less than a Hundred dollars and option C. More than a Hundred dollars.\n\nAnswer: EITHER option B. Less than A Hundred Dollars OR C. More than A Hundred Dollar\n\nInput: How long was the lighthouse's history? Choices: 1.

Choices: A: kind for B: good to C: in for D: favor to E: good to\nRationales: The question is asking for an action verb that my sister can perform on me\n1. The phrase \"doing me kind for\" indicates that my sister is performing or doing an action to me.\n2. Among the choices, the action words that may be used for a person would be \"doing for\", \"giving me\", and \"doing in favor of\".\n3. Of these words, \"doing for me\" is the only one that has the context of an action, leaving the remaining choices from this phrase as either place-based or state-based.\n4. Looking at the remaining choices, \"good to\" refers to a state, while \"good for\" refers to a location. \"In for\" is a combination of both, thus a combination of a state and location.\n5. Likewise, \"doing me kind\" refers to a state and \"good to me\" to a location.\n6. There is only one choice that combines location and action as desired. It is 'doing for me\n7. The answer is A: doing for me.\nAnswer: A; doing for me\n\nInput: It was a rainy night, what was the weather? Choices: 1. The weather was what?

The sentence is describing the conditions of the weather on a particular evening or night.\n2. It is stated it was a rainy night.\n3. This description of the weather on a certain night gives us enough information to infer that the weather, by definition, would be what?\n4. As rain, by definition, means that precipitation is occurring (in this case, rain), it is sufficient to conclude that the weather on the night was wet or 'rainy'.\n5.

Some work what from November to April? Choices: \tA: all season long B: holiday season C: Christmas D: summer E: none of above\nRationales: The question is asking us to fill in the word missing in a sentence. The sentence reads, \"Some people work all season long _____ some work when they have too.\"\n\nBased on the options provided, it would seem logical to say that there is nobody who works just a few months or a few weeks out of the entire year, which is the meaning of the phrase'some work when they have to'.\n\nHence, this means that someone is probably missing out on the job they've worked for. We can rule out A ('all season long') and E ('none of above') because some might work less than others, but they all must be working.\n\nWe can also rule out D ('Christmas'), as Christmas is a very small part of 4 months out of the year. Similarly, C ('Holiday season') is not specific to the month of April or any other month, so it's also out.\n\nTherefore, this leaves B ('November to April') as the only option, and hence, this is the correct option.\nAnswer: B : November to April\n\nInput: You are in the house, where are you supposedly?

The answers follow in order.\n\nA: The kitchen is not correct because the question is asking if these three other locations are correct. The question is asking us about things we actually know. Since we are asked about outside, the couch and the bedroom don't make sense either. Therefore, IV is not correct.\n\nB: III does not follow because outside is correct (I), and there is no home. Thus IV is correct.", "answer": "A: original"}

Choices: A: waters B: ice C: deserts D: deep E: forests\nRationales: The question revolves around octopus which is, as stated, best suited or suitable in specific places.\n1. We need to choose from the given options where the best places that would favor or suit an octopus are.\n2. We can quickly rule out all the options except option 'C: deserts' due to 'Octopus' being an aquatic creature which does not survive well in dry climates.\n3. This deduction is based on the context provided by the question which is that 'Octopus' is the best match and suited for specific places where 'deserts' are considered to be suitable and favorable for survival.\n4. Therefore the answer is C : Deserts\nAnswer: C: deserts\n\nInput: All cars traveling on roads go through where? Choices:  a.  highway b. car wash c. car dealership d. mechanic e. garage\nRationales 1. The statement describes roads and cars, so we need to determine where they are headed.\n2. Given the options, we can infer that all cars traveling on roads pass by mechanic as it relates to the need for car repairs.\n3. In fact, mechanic could be considered the destination for cars on the road.\n4. Cars may go through an actual car wash or car dealership location (b and d respectively) or a garage (e), but such locations do not equate to mechanic which is a term to do with car troubles or roadside repairs.\n5. So, the answer would be mechanic in this case.\nAnswer: mechanic\n\nInput: What is used to hold the ballot in a ballot box? Choices: 1. A. ballots 2. B. envelope 3. C. bags 4.

What is required of a good accountant? Choices: 1: A: a quick and efficient mind 2: B: an outdoorsy personality 3: C: a great deal of education 4: D: financial expertise 5: E: great technical skills\nRationales:\n1. The first sentence gives a hint that the business owners are looking into hiring someone to take care of the business's accounting. \n2. With the information, this would help us to choose a correct word/phrase for the second part of the sentence. \n3. 'a quick and efficient mind' is one word phrase so it cannot be answered. \n4. 'A great deal of education' is one word phrase and it cannot be answered either. \n5. Looking at all the terms together it is clear that the person must be a great mathematician able to handle the work in a quick and efficient manner, have a great mind, and have financial expertise. \n6. The correct phrase is 'great technical skills.'\nAnswer: E: great technical skill\n\nInput: What kind of place would be suitable to make a movie called \"Rain\"? Choices: 1 A: desert 2 B: beach 3 C: jungle 4 D: mountainside 5 E: city pavement\nRationales: The movie Rain is about rain, therefore the place must be someplace where rain tends to occur.\n1. Desert is a good answer: Deserts sometimes receive short rainfalls.\n2. Beach is not the ideal location: Rained beaches don't typically last long.\n3. City pavement is also a no-go: Rain puddles on pavement can easily evaporate due to temperature.\n4. Jungles sometimes get rain but also tend not to be conducive environments.\n5. Mountainsides can potentially receive rain, but most of the time not enough.\n6. Therefore the correct answer is B: BEACH as it is an ideal location for a rainfall.

Huge butt is not a person so it doesn't match the requirement of the question.

What are the materials used in its construction? Choices:  T: Iron Ties  A: Limestone E: Steel B: Wood   C: Cement F: Tires D: Concrete G:  Rails E: Timber\nRationales:  1. The question states that a new bridge is being built and we need to find out the materials used in its' construction.\n2. A bridge requires a base known as \"abutments\" which are usually made of concrete or stone.\n3. Then a bridge beam is inserted between these abutments, usually made of timber.\n4. After the bridge beam is put in place, the roadway is constructed, usually using asphalt.\n5. Finally there is a roof or canopy constructed on top of the bridge to make it safer for people and to protect the steel beam.\n6. Considering these necessary elements, and the options provided, we see there are no materials used to build the bridge outside of concrete, iron, limestone, rails, timber, and ties.\n7. However, the term \"bases\" are not the materials themselves. Rather, they are the objects, including concrete and stones, upon which materials are set,", "answer": "D: play piano"}

Three of these are obvious: butter, waffle, and jam. \n2. Of seven choices to the question, the only ones consistent with \"waffles\" going last are \"apple rings\", \"jam\", and \"butter\".\n3. The word \"list\" in the sentence implies that the sequence should be given in chronological or sequential order.\n4. The order of these three choices, \"apple rings\", \"butter\", and \"jam\" matches the logical order given in the question.\n5. Therefore the most logical sequence is \"apple rings\", \"Jam\", \"butter\".\nAnswer:\nA: apple rings before butter\nB: jam before butter\nC: Apple rings after butter\nD: jam after butter\nE: fruit before jam\nF: fruit first\nG: fruit after butter\nH: butter before fruit\nI: apple rings after butter and jam\n\nInput: What's a fruit that's orange?

The other three are \"banana\", \"apple\", and \"pear\".\nFrom the 6 choices, we see that \"watermelon\" goes after \"pineapple\", \"mango\" goes after pineapple, and \"pineapple\" goes after mango.\nWe see that there is no \"grape\", although it is in the original sentence and a possible answer when \"fruit\" and \"orange\" are combined.\nGiven the limited choices, \"", "answer": "C: bring home fish"}

{"text": "hands and, therefore, is the right choice of answer.\nAnswer: E. Tree\n\nInput: It's possible the author of the paper was from where? Choices:  Winnipeg Manitoba Canada Toronto Ontario Canada\nRationales:\n1. The two cities, \"Winnipeg Manitiba\" and Toronto\", are from Canada. However, the fact that they belong to different provinces could mean the author is from one or the other. \n2. Since the paper is titled 'Toronto and Winnipeg,' the choices are either of the two. \n3. However, there is no reason to believe that the author must be from either of those cities so the question refers to an alternative location where the author is from.\n4. The cities' names are indicative of geographic regions, meaning the author is the resident of Manitoba or Ontario respectively.\n5. The sentence structure suggests these names are not indicative of provinces themselves but are attached together by an 'and,' implying they belong to the same geographical area.\n6. Therefore the author is from Manitoba or Ontario if we're to consider that Toronto and Winnipeg are within the same geographical region.\n7. However, there are still more choices available. For instance the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island are also parts of that region.\n8. However, there's no evidence that the author belongs to one or the other province from that geographical area so we can assume Toronto and Winnipibgb can only be Manitoba and Ontario accordingly.\n9. As such, the author is from Ontario or Manitoba respectively.\nAnswer: E and F: Ontario and Manitoba\n\nInput: How should you treat a witch without the potion?

Choices:  A. It became louder. B. It became higher. C. It became pitch. D. It became clear. E. It became calm\nRationales:1. Firstly, we need to understand what the term 'pitch' refers to. From the dictionary, we see that pitch can be described as the particular quality of a sound that makes it distinguishable from other sound(s). Thus, pitch is a characteristic of sound, and not a feeling that can be associated with the voice to make it 'clear'.\n2. Therefore, if the doctor's voice 'became' any of the given adjectives, that adjective must refer to a different property of the voice other than pitch.\n3. On analyzing the different adjectives, we see that 'clearer sound' is a synonym to 'clear' or 'clear voice', which means that the answer A. is not a correct term to describe the doctor's voice at that point.\n4. Further, none of the other adjectives have clear connotations that could be assigned to the doctor's voice.\n5. Hence, based on our analysis of the question, the doctor's voice did not 'become' any of the options present.\n6. Hence, the only answer that accurately describes the voice is the answer C.\nAnswer: C. It became pitch\n\n### Instrument: The doctor's patient was worried and confused.

Choices: 1) A: box 2) B: apparatus 3) C: appliance 4) D: wash dish 5) E: implement\nRationale: 1. The context of this question is to determine the meaning of a sentence.\n2. A 'box' is a non-descriptive place or container. It is not a device that produces a'machine.'\n3. An 'apparatus' is a specific term for a scientific tool, however, does not refer to anything specific about the tool.\n4. An 'appliance' is a cooking device or another type of technology, which again does not suggest the production of a machine.\n5. A dishwasher is not technically a machine, it is simply a tool or device for cleaning dishes and other utensils.\n6. Finally, it is logical to deem the statement as a general congratulatory message with no specific machine in mind.\n7. Consequently, there is no need to look at the specifics of a box, apparatus, or appliance. They do not refer to a machine, but rather, to specific tools.\n8. There is only one choice that refers to the creation of a'machine', and we can deduce this to be the only choice that is relevant. It is'machine.

Choices: minutes, days, and years\nRationales: Analyzing the first part of the question, we see the context has to do with the duration of a geyser blow-out. \n1. The blowout has to last at least 12 hours to fulfill the question's requirements. \n2. The options, thus, range from a minimum of 12 hours to a maximum.\n3. This indicates that the blowout typically lasts for days and years, which is longer than 12 hours.\n4. Based on this, the options available as choices are incorrect.\n5. Answer: Answer: A: hours\n Answer: A: Hours\n\nInput: The house was large and stately with a mansion on the side. Choices: A: mansion B: palace C: palace D: country estate E: mansion\nRationales: It is important to know that'mansion' is a synonym of 'palace'.\n1. The sentence is describing a large, established, and extravagant residential structure.\n2. The main building part - the mansion - of this structure is positioned behind the country estate that it shares with. \n3. Both of the structures mentioned in the question and their locations convey status, wealth and importance.\n4. Hence the correct answer is B: palace\n\nAnswer: B: palace\n\nInput: The company was looking to hire two people who could be invaluable.  They sought a new manager and an additional Choices:  A. member B. member C. worker D. employee E. team member\nRationales: The company is looking for two people to fill two openings in their departments.\n1.

Choices:  B: apple C: orange D: pine E: apple orchard\nRationales:\n1. The question is referring to a tree that could hold the'most fruits', hence we are looking for a particular characteristic that only certain tree types share. In particular, fruits are not generally associated with non-planted trees.\n2. 'B: apple' includes 'fruit' so we can eliminate that choice.\n3. 'D: pine' could hold a lot of 'cones', but we don't know if those are considered as fruits or something else. Further, fruits are not usually associated with 'pine' so we can eliminate choice C.\n4. 'E: apple orchard' seems to agree most with the context, in that we know apples will be present and there is a lot to choose from.\n5. Hence, the most appropriate answer would be 'E: apple orchards'.\nAnswer: E: apple orchards\n\nInput: In the book, every major character is a what? Choices: A: detective   B: soldier   C: businessman   D: criminal   E: homeless person\nRationales:  1. We have to determine the most appropriate context of the word'major'.  2. Looking at the available options we see that a 'detective', 'businessman', or 'criminal' (i.e. an antagonist) could be a'major' character  3. We also know from the given context that the characters in the story are either good or bad  4. A 'homeless person' is unlikely to be included in the list of'major' characters as it suggests they have very little importance in the story  5. Hence, the best possible answer could be either a 'businessman' or a 'criminal'.\nAnalyze how the choices are consistent with the statements.  \n  A: detective B: businessman C: criminal  \n5. Option A: 'detective' is not consistent with the statement 'character' because it refers to a detective  4.

They're both dense vegetation, but which is more humid? Choices:  a: rainforest b: jungle c: dense vegetation d: desert e: tropical\nRationales: Question: A jungle and a rainforest are similar in that they're both dense vegetations, but one is more humid than the other.\n1. The phrases \"jungle\" and \"rainforest\" are used interchangeably more often than not.\n2. The two concepts are in fact different.\n3. When it comes to vegetation, there are four types.\n3. Jungles and rainforests are examples of closed vegetation, which is denser and wetter than other types.\n4. A desert is an example of an open, dry vegetation.\n5. Dense vegetation refers to closed vegetation, so the answer is b: jungle.\nAnswer: a: rainforest\n\nInput: The man knew that his old car wasn't running how? Choices: 1. B: properly 2. B: smoothly 3. D: soundly 4. A: quietly 5. C: properly\nRationales: The man's old car wasn't moving, so he knew how it wasn't running.\n4.

Choices:  B: an ounce  C: a liter  D: a kilo  E: ten meters\nRationales: We need to compare different items. We don't know how we're comparing them so we need to determine if we want to compare them by weight or length.\n3. When we compare items in weight, we use the prefix \"oz\" and \"kg\".\n3. There is no such thing as a liter or 10 meters; these refer to length.\n1. A kilo is heavier than a ounze; you need", "answer": "A: food"}

Choices: 1. A: tidy 2. B: neat 3. C: untidy 4. D: tidily 5. E: Neatly\nRationales: Analyzing the question statements, it is clear that there is a discrepancy in \"What is the opposite of being... \"and the statement that follows it (\"... disheveled?\"). \nThis is due to the fact that there must be an adjective in between the two sentences to form a complete sentence structure. Since both statements are incomplete, we must use this observation to determine how to complete it. \nFrom the options below, \"Tidy\" is not the opposite of \"disheveled\" because it can be interpreted as \"neat.\" \nOn this, the first set of options could read as \"What is the opposite to being disheveled?\" or \"What is the opposite from being disheveled, and it the answer would be 'Tidy.\n\" However, \"Neat\" is the complete opposite to \"disheveled,\" and the possible second sentence in question can be completed as, \"What is the opposite...,\" thus, \"Neat\" has been selected as the answer.\nAnswer: E \u2013 Neatly\n\nInput: I'm a music lover.  I play my music on my what? Choices: A: speaker B: turntable C: microphone D: record player E: cassette\nRationales: To determine the correct response, we must observe the phrases within the question statement. The first phrase, \"I'm a music lo,\" suggests the context of listening to and enjoying music.\nThe second phrase, \"...play my music,\" indicates that there is a device involved in enabling the music lover to play their music. \nTherefore, the correct response will be found in the options through the second phrase. \nThe correct response will be relevant and applicable to all the options found in the second phrase.  Thus, the choices should have a certain relation and/or relation to music, either directly or indirectly.\nSince \"cass", "answer": "C: count"}

It is impossible for the cat to traverse underground since the statement \"the door was closed\" limits the range of motion, implying that it should be something above the door level.\n2. The options provided are outside, in, inside, and next door, but none of them are viable from the wording of the question or the given context.\n3. The answer becomes easier to determine by eliminating the options that are not feasible.\n4. We should begin by eliminating the option of being outside. We already know from the context that this action can't be feasible, and the wording also rules out the option.\n5. The options 'in' and 'next door' are also eliminated. A cat cannot be 'in' or move 'next door' unless the door is left open.\n 6. As a result of the elimination process, we are left with one remaining choice which must be the correct answer answer: C. underground.\n Answer: C. underground\n\n----\n####\n### Write at least 20 paragraphs\n - The topic of the paragraph can be related to any topic.\n - Write a comprehensive and logical answer for each paragraph with correct Grammar.\n - You should write 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,or more sentences for each paragraph.\n\n-------\n\n### Instructions:\n\nYou will have a total of 6 hours for this task, and you will have to complete 4 paragraphs and a conclusion in that time period.

Where may they put all that furniture that needs to go in the new place? Choices:  B A: hall B: living room C: room D: lobby E: back\nRationales:1. The question asks, 'Where could they put that 'furniture' that was mentioned in the previous question.\n2. There are 5 options provided; only one is the most apt answer for the question prompt.\n3. When a building is new, most likely those rooms where people will be spending most of their waking hours are the living room, room, hall and lobbies.\n4. From the context and available choices, it may be considered that the furniture could potentially be placed in these 4 rooms only. To help distinguish the choice that needs to be identified amongst them, it is beneficial to think about the rooms that are more formal.\n\nThe living room and hall are not too structured while the lobby and room have a more formal vibe. While the living room may be a good place to 'put' furniture at, it is not a room considered as formal.\n\nThe lobby is a formal and usually welcoming room where visitors or people coming into the building would wait and greeted by the people inside.\n\nFurnishings are not expected here either. Hence, we eliminate that option.\n\nWithin that, the room and the hall are more likely to be rooms that are formal enough to 'put' that furniture in.\n\nWithin these two rooms as well, the 'room' is more likely to be the formal place to put all that furniture.\n\nThe hall is likely a more casual area and furnishings are less expected to be placed there. This, eliminates option B: hall from being the choice for the answer.\n\n\n\n5. We are left with options A: living room and D: lobby.\n6. From analysis of these two choices, 'lobby' seems to be the best choice because it implies a formal room with high expectations.\n7.

She was really tall C. She had a steep ladder D. She jumped really high E. She climbed the rocky cliff\nRationales: We can see that Ms. Tall found herself at a high, inaccessible place, where there was a box of treasure.\n1. The question is: How did Ms. T get to where the box was located?\n2. Looking at all the answers: A) She threw a rope - although, this could be true, it does not satisfy the description. She did not get to where the box of treasure is located. This is probably a possible answer, but it may be disregarded as possibly the correct answer (not sure), so we'll need to rule it out.\n3. B) She was really tall - this would only work if she could simply reach the box, which we'd know if the box was at a reasonable height if the box was at 10 feet, Ms. T would likely be able to get to where the box is. This is likely not what we're looking for as well.\n4. C) She had a steep and tall ladder - This is what we want, the ladder she \"had\", which could be implied as something she obtained, like her husband brought it to her (if she only had her husband to help her). However, it may not be clear, so we can't take this answer as it is as well. \n5. D) She jumped really high - This answer does not satisfy the description either. This implies that she jumps, she does not use a ladder.\n6. E) She climbed the rock cliff - This is what we were looking for. This is exactly what we'd expect Ms. T to do given the description.\n7.

Choices:  B: bird of prey C: feathered species D: flightless species E: carnivores\nRationales:\n1. The question is a statement involving the categorization of birds.\n2. We already know that certain birds are categorized as \"birds of prey\", \"feathered species\", \"flightless species\", and \"carnivores\".\n3. However, the statement mentions that some birds in each of the categories have something in common.\n4. Let's see if we can identify the commonality.\n5. Looking at the categorizations and the statement in the context of \"some birds of each\", we can infer that these categories refer to groups of birds or individual birds in these categories collectively.\n6. This would mean that \"common thing\" could refer to commonality in certain characteristics or quality, and not necessarily just one particular characteristic or quality shared by all the birds in a group.\n7. Looking at the given list of categories, \"carnivores\" is not the only shared characteristic, so if we eliminate it, it becomes apparent that there are three other shared characteristics among \"birds of pre\", \"feathered spe\" and \"flightless spe\".\n8. These three shared characteristics are: (1) ability to fly; (2) birds with feathers; (3) carnivorous diet.\n9. This gives us the options C: feathered spe; D: flightless spe; and E: carnivorous diets.\n10. Since the options listed are not the only set of birds that contain the categorized shared characteristics, the question can't be answered with any given singular option.\n11.

Choices: A: running away B: hiding C: standing their ground D: fighting E: taking to flight\nRationales: The question is asking what animals do when the danger they face is so high that they are in danger.  Options A and B are inappropriate because the answer is what animals do when they are in danger of death, which they are clearly not.\n\nThe question also implies that there is a possibility of the answer being more than one thing, in which case the answer should be either a or e.\n\nThe words \"react\" and \"dangerous\" imply that animals may decide to \"react\" by hiding, standing their ground, fighting, or taking to fight if it can get them out of danger.\n\nChoice C is incorrect because to stand their ground means fighting back, but fighting back would not always bring the animals out of danger in the first place if they had been in immediate danger.\n\nChoice D is incorrect because to stand one's ground also means to fight for an idea or position. In such situations, animals may not react instinctively in the face of danger, but this is not how the question phrases the response.\n\nTherefore, the answer is a or e.\nAnswer: E Taking to flight\n\nInput: I had a horrifying experience at a train station the other day.

It is important to note that the given options do not necessarily have to be sweet in all senses of the word.\n1. The bee is looking to mate, so we can consider a'sweet' bee as one that is'sexy'.\n2. Nectar, honey, sugar, and sugar cane have the same meaning in the sexual and food context.\n3. Therefore, we can choose any of these to answer the question, but the most suitable term to represent'sweet' and not contradict the assertion of the question is 'nectar'.\n4. The bee's reference to'sweetness' implies that it's likely looking for a'sweet' mate, which can be interpreted as looking for a'sexier' mate, one who's younger or more desirable in terms of appearance or attractiveness.\n5.

Thanksgiving is a holiday celebrated in the United States which generally includes gathering together and sharing a meal with family and friends on November 26.\n2. To hear a tiger roaring on Thanksgiving, a tiger would have to be in America on the day.\n3. This implies that the setting for Thanksgiving would have to be in the United States.\n4. The tiger would probably have to be in a setting where other tigers are heard, hence a National park setting can be ruled out because it's a place where there is not a whole lot of tiger roaring going on.\n5. In addition to National Park, all the other choices are possible for a tiger to be roaring.\n6. Stadium, D: forest is a possible venue for spectators at a football or hockey game with loud roaring or cheering.\n7. Since Thanksgiving is a quiet and peaceful holiday where it isn't usual to hear loud screaming or roaring, a stadium in the United States wouldn't be a good choice.\n8.

The description is vague, there might be an abundance of activity at a bookstore as there is more space dedicated to holding and selling items. While a library might be more conducive to studying and research, it is not typically a place full of things to do.\n### 2. Bookstores may contain games and toys, but they are usually more stationary or fixed.\n### There is not necessarily something to do at a bookstore unless you are shopping for books.\n\n### Choose E: garden\n\n### 3. More likely, one will find a garden as a location to unwind. In addition, one would most likely be occupied with gardening activities in a garden.\n### 4. Choices C and E are the most appropriate answers here\n\n### Rationale\n1. The question is about a place where you can find a lot to do.\n2. A library and a bookstore both feature books and the ability to purchase something. However, a library typically offers more static activities like reading or taking notes.\n3. Bookstores can typically offer more opportunities for action, but not necessarily if they sell non-moving items. A better choice would be the garden.\n4. A garden can be an ideal place to do any number of things that do not", "answer": "E: cellar"}

Hence we can infer that if a marmot can be found in high, a tree is the most likely candidate.\nAnswer: E Tree\n\nInput: The musician's song was very popular, she gained what recognition for her achievement? Choices: A: critical acclaim B: popularity C: critical attention D: fame E: notoriety\nRationales:\n1. The question asks for the recognition the musician's song received, not the achievement itself. \n2. One can gain fame or notoriety in general, but gaining \"critical acclaim\" implies positive reception from a recognized critic or group of critics, and cannot be used as a catch-all term like \"fame\".\n3. Similarly - gaining \"critical attention\" is gaining attention with consideration of whether it's favorable or unfavorable rather than just widespread popularity.\n4. Likewise, gaining \"fame\" merely denotes a large crowd of attention seekers rather than any particular kind of critical reception.\n5. In contrast \"critical acclaim and critical attention\" both denote some kind of quality that gives a critical assessment.\n6. Finally, \"critical acclaim\", although in the plural form, is also more specific, since it implies there is a particular group of critics involved.\n7. So the answer is D: \"Fame\".\nAnswer: D: Fame\n\nInput: As a young child, how is a bicycle ride usually referred to? Choices: A. fun, joyful B. scary, dangerous C. boring D. tiring E. interesting\nRationales: The word \"usually\" indicates that most young children have a consistent experience of riding a bicycle.  So the question is to select the adjective/description we would associate the most with the experience.\n\n1. Adjectives A and B describe how most people would feel about the experience at the end, and we need to consider what adjectives are most associated with the beginning.\n2. Both C and D are reasonable options because they describe how boring or tiring an activity can often be for somebody first trying it.\n3. However, C is more specific, since riding a bicycel might be scary, but usually scare is associated at the beginning of a ride, when learning how to do", "answer": "C: three feet"}

Choices: A: an exotic pig A: porcine-raiser B: a farm-owner C: a pig-rearer D: a farmer E: a pig owner\nRationales: Firstly, looking at the choices we can infer that the woman cares for pigs. We can identify this by analysing that none of the other options states 'caring' for pigs\n1. The phrase 'exotic pig' simply refers to a pig that does not belong to that woman.\n2. Thus, 'A' is the incorrect choice.\n3. 'Piglet-taker' implies that she is not a pig owner, as piglets would presumably be found on her property in a location where pigs can be raised such as a farm.\n4. Therefore, 'B' is the incorrect option.\n5. 'C' is incorrect because 'pig-rearer' implies that she is directly responsible for pigs, which is the opposite of 'pig-taker'.\n6. 'E' is incorrect because 'farm-owner' would mean that she owns the farm where pigs may be raised. Piglets do not usually live on farms.\n7. 'D' does not make sense as a word choice because, in this case, a female pig-farmer is a 'pigger'\n8. Therefore, the only option that fits is option 'C', she was a 'pig-reaper'.\nAnswer: C: Pig-rearer. \n\nInput: The man on the train was wearing what? Choices:A: a hat, B: a pantsuit, C: a shirt, D: an outfit\nRationales: The context of the sentence mentions someone wearing an outfit or suit, not an in-suit and pantsuit\n1. If looking at the word choices we can note that option 'hat' is not a clothing item", "answer": "C: care for children"}

Choices:  A : jungle B: cave C: ice cream store D: field E: deep sea\nRationales: The problem statement implies that crabs have characteristic anatomical properties that help them to crawl.\nCrabs also have claws on their multiple limbs and have the ability to be found in various environments.\nLooking at the choices given, the answer choices B: cave and C: ice cream parlor are probably the two choices that make the most sense given what is known about crabs and our context.\nIt is less likely that a crab would be found in a jungle since the environment is likely a bit hotter and less likely that ice cream parlor would be found due to the temperature of the environment, and given that it wouldn't be typical to see crabs crawling around in one.\nSo, the possible choice is B: cave and E: ocean.\nThe ocean is a relatively cold environment and many ocean environments might be deemed as a cave-like environment. Since the claws on crabs are used for grabbing things, it is likely that crabs that are found in these types of environments could be seen crawling or walking around using their claws to help them in their crawling motion since they could be grabbing and holding onto something.\nAnswer: B : cave E : ocean\n\n### Solution:\nInput:\nThe machine was very intricate.

Choices: A: the mushroom rockets B: space mountain C: star wars ride D: it's a small world E: mission space\nRationales: The question asks about where an amusement park is an ideal place to enjoy thrills.\n1. Based on the given set of choices for the answer, option E: Mission Space is the only choice which has thrills as its core attraction. \n2. According to option E: Mission Space, it is the only ride which has thrills as the attraction that entices the visitor.\n3. Hence the correct answer is Mission Space.\nAnswer: E. Mission Space\n\nInput: In which movie were the two witches named Baba Yaga and the Iron Teeth? Choices: A. Fanny and Alexander B. Haneke's Amour C. The Tin Drum D. The Magic Flute E. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\nRationales: Here, the answer was about Baba Yaga. It is found in Haneke's \"Amor\", \"The Tin Drum\", and \"The Imaginarium of Doctor\"\nThese three movies are the most suitable options to be the place in which the witches named BABA YAGA would be found. Haneke' Amour can be found in English. The main idea is whether we have seen the movie or read the novel. \nThen the answer was \"Amor\" and \"Doctor Parnassus\" as the witches Baba Yaga were found in these movies and Amor is found in The Tin Drum, Doctor Parnassus and The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus. \nAnswer: B, D and E\n# Complete the sentences by supplying the appropriate words.\n\n### Task:\n### Instruction(s):  Answer the following multiple", "answer": "A: few people"}

The book is called the golden compass because it is golden.\n2. All other options describe only specific characteristics of the book or the compass, but the golden compass would clearly refer to their shared attribute, which is their gold colored nature.\n3. Therefore, the book is called a golden compass because of its golden color, which makes option A : its color the correct choice.\nAnswer: A : its color\n\n![](.//images/img_3842203_5133356183040.png)\n\nInput: The bird was found in a very high place where it may have resided. Choices:  A. in a tree B. outside C. outside. Choices:\n1. In the first question of the instructions, which begins with `How is a Marmot's Hand' then a table of contents, we see a table of contents showing a list of questions and answers.\n2. However, rather than actually using the table of contents, we had to identify a single term within it in order to gain a better understanding of the prompt.\n3. In this case,'resided' would be an appropriate word, and we can infer that it is being used with the \"very high place\", indicating that it is the bird's permanent home.\n4. Option '1' does not actually use'resided' (which is the first part) or 'home'.\n5. Option '2' does not use'resided' and only uses 'home'.\n6. Option '3' uses'resided' but does not use 'home'.\n7. Option '4' only mentions 'bird' without any more context, so it does not support the answer.\n8. Option '5' does not use any of the terms necessary to answer the prompt correctly.\n9.

Choices: \t A: in a suitcase B: behind the desk C: in the attic D: in a bin E: in the shelves\nRationales: Luggage is typically placed in a bin, drawer or other storage area to keep it separate from other objects, especially if it's of high value. \n\nLuggage is also often stored near its owner or user on request. \n\nFinally, luggage must be put away in a clean and easily accessible place which is not in an open and visible area in the presence of others.\n\nIf we apply these three factors, it's clear that the luggage cannot have been put behind the desk or in an attic as both places allow the luggage to be seen and accessed by others.\n\nHence, the luggage would only be put behind the desk if no other options were possible and there were no other possible locations present.\n\nOn the other hand, the luggage could have been left in a bin or shelves and it would fit into the criteria as it doesn't require the luggage to have been in an open and visible location.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D, `ln a bin` or `ln shelves`\n\nAnswer: D: bin and shelves\n\nInput: We were sitting under the tree.

We can infer that this probably wasn't a person who was very afraid of trees or branches or that someone with those fears would likely not be sitting under a tree.\n\nIf the person was sitting under a tree and a branch fell above them, their reaction would likely be to jump out of the way or back up", "answer": "D: were very tired"}

Deconstruction is a term used to describe the process of taking something apart to understand its components. \n2. This process can be applied to revealing secret information, such as what a magician does with their tricks. \n3. Deconstruction can be used to show how the trick is performed, thereby revealing the secrets. \n4. \"Cleart\" is a vague word that doesn't provide any insight into how the secret is hidden.\n5. \"Transparent\" is a vague idea that could refer to a variety of things, not just revealing the secret.\n6. \"Discharging\" refers to something that is discharged or released. It also doesn't describe hiding any secrets.\n7. \"Reconstruction\" is a physical action and doesn't refer to anything specific, like hiding the secret(s) underlying a magic trick.\n8. \"Deconstructing\" is the process of taking something down to its basic components.\n9. \"Discarding\" refers to throwing something away or away from it. Again, it doesn't describe how one would hide a secret that is used to perform a magic trick.\n10. \"Avoiding\" can be used to describe how a magician may hide the methodology or secret used in performing some trick.\n11. \"Deconstructing invisibly\" means to disassemble something in such a way so that it cannot be seen from outside. \n12. \"Secretly\" is a good description of hiding secrets used to perform magic tricks.\n13. \"Simple\" is an adjective", "answer": "B: answers"}

The question is using the word \"many\" which is referring to the years. So we should think in the context of the previous games.\n2. There is no other reason to use plural \"years\".\n3. Therefore, we don't expect to see singular words in the choices like a lot etc.\n4. If you have many friends then you can share your food with them.

What might the work be? Choices: A: classwork, book report B: science projects, reading C: reading, paperwork D: math, research E: work projects, writing paperwork\nRationales:  1. The main context of the problem statement involves student workload, where it's indicated that the students in a class will be faced with a lot of work done in the span of one day.\n2. Generality of task completion is important in the statement, so it can't be a single task like a \"book report\" or \"reading\" done within one day.\n3. Since it has to be done in the course of a single day, it would be impossible for something like book reports or reading to take much time.\n4. These are all individual tasks on top of each other, not in combination with other work.\n5. This implies that it would have to be multiple tasks.\n6. The options available include \" classwork\", \" science projects\", \" paperwork\", \" math\", \" research\", and \"work projects\".\n7. We can rule off options D and E because they involve multiple tasks.\n8. Additionally, as we said, the teacher didn't mention multiple individual tasks that needed to be completed in a single day.\n9. Thus we are left with options A, B, and C.\n10. However, we can infer that the teacher is not going to assign a lot of classwork and math to a student, as these options are usually too difficult or lengthy for children to achieve in a short time like one day.\n11. So, options A and B are automatically eliminated. This leaves us with option C.\n12. Thus, The teacher informed her class what they would do is do a lot of \"reading\" and \"work projects\". \n13. This is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B - A: science projects, reading E: work projects, research, math.", "answer": "D: poker game"}

It might not be suitable to rent to any families with what? Choices: A: small children B: babies C: small pets D: children E: young girls\nRationales: * The phrase \"...small, narrow, and very\", refers to the description of the house.\n* Each word here describes the dimensions of the house, which might not be suitable for any family with children (A,B,C,D,E).\n* Considering the context of the statement, the phrase '...small, narrow, and' describes the house and implies why it would not be suitable for families with children.\n* The phrase 'with children' indicates that the '...small, narrow and very' qualities of the house make it unsafe for children to live in.\n\nSo '...small, narrow....and very' qualities are unsafe for children to live.\n\nSo the answer is 'Family with small children'\n\nAnswer: Family with small children\n\nInput: Some animals are not meant to live near human beings.

Choices:  - A: infection B: bone disease C: burn-out D: fractures E: broken bones\nRationales: - 1. The question refers to a situation where there was a crash, resulting in many people being injured and requiring medical attention for a \"want\" or an \"if\".\n- 2. The \"many people\" imply that there would be multiple individuals who needed to be checked for different injuries or \"way\"s.\n- 3. Hence, there should be more than one type of injury that is identified for each individual, if any.\n- 4. Further, each individual only would require one \"way\" that they were injured, unlike a situation where many people get hurt in different ways.\n- 5. This means, that each person needs to be assessed for each way they got hurt \"if any\".\n- 6. Therefore, looking at the choices available, we exclude the options which have two different ways to get hurt in them.\n- 7. This includes option E: 'broken bones' and option B: 'bones disease' because 'broken bones/ bones disease' are different types of injuries that imply different ways to get hurt and each person is only one person.\n- 8. The options which have only a way of getting hurt but no way of being hurt are also excluded.\n- 9. For example, option D: 'fractures' has only fractured bones as a way of getting hurt, but not one of getting hurt.\n- 10. So this option is also excluded.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- 11. Hence, the only possible answer left is option A: 'infection' which has an entry of 'infection' in the third line of the sentence.\n- 12. Therefore, the answer to this question is option A: 'Infection'\n\nInput: In order to stay healthy, it is important for me to eat foods that are high-nutritional value.

Considering the haunted house is not really haunted, the guy is likely not worried about such monsters.\n2. Option B: ghosts is not right. Based on the passage, the guy has not seen any ghosts in the haunted house.\n3. Option C: robbers does not fit the context.

Choices: a. push the car in the mud b. try to push other things out of the way c. stop trying and back up d. try to push the car out of the way on a slope\n\nRationales Why are we able to push things? We push other things because of the force on the object pushing that object. For example, I'm pushing the table. So the force I apply on the table that allows me to move it is \"force\".\n\nRationales This push of other things allows for pushing a car out of a muddy.\n\nChoices to check: A. push the car away B. try to push other objects out of the way C. stop trying and go back to where you came from D. try to push the object off the ground.", "answer": "D: say you're welcome"}

Choices: A: medium height B: short C: tall D: huge E: long\nRationales:1. If something is 'tall', it implies it's either very tall or tall. But it does not necessarily mean short or medium either.\n2. Therefore the correct answer should be the one that means 'tall'.\n3. 'Medium height','short', 'huge', and 'long' are not appropriate answers because they do not describe 'tall' or'very tall'.\n4.

Choices: Dirty clothes B: muddy boots C: grease stains D: oil stains E: stoned shoes\nRationales:\n1. According to the context, an item can be difficult to clean.\n2. We can rule out options B, C, and D because what they are referring to indicates stains and marks on clothes, boots, and shoes.\n3. The items in these options are very easy to clean, especially if they are dirty, muddy, or greasy.\n4. The most logical options to look for here are E or A.\n5.

Therefore, the sentence does not tell us where exactly the Marmots are found on a tree, hence the choice between E: outside and E: tree would be a toss-up.\n9. However, we can rule out 'outside' because the Marmots are placed in trees. Therefore, the sentence is saying that Marmots can be in high places, and to that end it makes sense that Marmots end up inhabiting high places like trees. Hence, the answer to the sentence is E: tree. Answer: E: outside\n\nInput: I just saw a wizard in the park, and he asked me what I dreamed of. He said he could deliver the contents to me.

Choices:  A:\" in good B:\" in worse C:\" used for too long D:\" driven many times E:\" travelled many miles\nRationales: We may ask you to: Read through several choices until you find one that fits the sentence.\n1. The subject of the sentence \"car\" is being described as being in \"good shape\", which would not be accurate to say if it were broken down.\n2. Choices A through E all describe the car as being in one of these states. 3. Only A: \"in good\" shape and E: \"in worse\" shape do not contradict the car being in \"good\" shape.\n4. E: \"in worse than\" shape can be deduced using logical reasoning, which is not encouraged during the GRE. (See rule number 8.)\n5. However, A: \"in good shape\" is not an accurate context to describe the car, so it can be eliminated.\n6. B,\"C\" and \"D\" all contradict the fact that the car is \"in good shape\". Therefore, eliminating these is logical.\n7. Therefore E: \"in worse shape\" shape is an accurate answer.\nAnswer: E:\" in worse shape\"\n\nInput: Who was the best team to play against?

The grandmother said, \"Whatever you do, there will be what at it?\" Choices:  A B C D E F G H J Q K L M W R O B S P Z\nRationales:1. The question is regarding a conversation where a man asks his grandmother about his career choice.\n2. The grandmother then asks the man \"what will he do?\" implying she doesn't comprehend what occupation he's considering.\n3. From the options, we can make out that 'A: Work,' 'B: Career,' 'C: Job, 'D:'Profession,' 'E: Function,' 'F: Purpose,' 'G: JOB,' 'H: Task,' 'J: Role,' 'K: Occupation,' 'L: Skill,' 'M: Vocation,' 'N: Vocation,' 'O: Roles,' 'P: Job,' 'Q: Function,' 'R: Vocation,' 'S: Vocation,' 'T: Position,' 'U: Duty,' 'V: Purpose,' 'W: Job,' 'X: Career,' 'Y: Job,' 'Z: Task,' none meet the grandmother's question.\n4. From the options, the only one that meets the grandmother' question is 'JOB'.\n5. Therefore we can rule out the remaining options.\n6. We should also consider that 'JOB' means a full-time occupation that earns one income.\n7. However, the question is not asking what income will be earned by being in a specific career.\n8. Hence, we can rule out 'JOB' and can arrive at 'P': Profession.\n9. 'Profession' means some learned course of teaching or practice that enables one to make an occupation or means of subsistence\n10. According to the question, the man is asking his grandmother for career advice, so she needs to explain any activity he can do to earn money.\n11.

Her boss never treated her with respect in a workplace he expected to be professional, and he tried not to get angry when her work failed what? Choices:   A: quality B: safety C: volume D: price E: accuracy\nRationales: Looking at the description of the boss and how he handles the employees' work, we can infer the following: 1. 'He expected to be professional' implies that he is not in-fact professional. His expectations are unrealistic or not well-grounded in actuality. 2. 'tried not to get angry when 'work' failed' could be construed to mean 'when the worker's work failed'. If that's the case, it implies the boss has a low threshold to anger.\n3. It also implies that the boss is not actually angry because he 'tried not to', which is a concession to the emotion and signifies he has anger issues.  4. 'He tried not to get angry' may also mean that the boss does not try to resolve the problems that fail his expectations. He ignores them or pretends they do not happen.  5. This makes 'quality' and 'volume' unlikely. 6. 'Price' - not a good fit because he isn't angry at the worker per-se. 7.

What sort of musical performance might be cheaper to watch?  Choices: A: free concert B: opera C: play D: rock band E. ballet\nRationales:  1. Analyzing the task context and question, we understand that a'musical' has expenses associated with it.\n2. Therefore, in the task direction, we are interested in the choice of options from which a cheaper musical may be chosen. We should, therefore, look for options that offer a comparatively lesser expense.\n3. The options provided in the question don't seem to offer price information in any way.\n4. 'C: play' can imply a drama but isn't necessarily about music. In fact, most people would say it's just a story about characters.\n    5. 'D: rock band' is a form of musical that doesn't seem to have a lot of costs involved in it.\n    6. 'B: opera' and 'E: ballet' are the real choices we're looking for and are both very likely to be cheaper since they're less elaborate in nature.\n    7. So, the best option to choose is B: opera.\n    8. Option A: 'free concert' can't be chosen because it doesn't indicate any musical to be chosen, just the form of concert 'free'.\n    9. Option E: ballet might also be cheaper because it's a form of dance and does not necessarily have to be accompanied by music.\n    10 However, ballet is less common than opera and not many people even know what type of music is played for it. Thus, there's less chance that this can be chosen.\n    11 Consequently, the correct answer is B: opera.

Since you can \"make up\" for something, an expression that indicates to pretend as if something else is the result. The verb \"make up\" is what we should focus on.\n2. There shouldn't be clothing, car or house involved, because all these options refer to places where you can wear clothing, drive a car or enter a house.\n3. An option that involves a physical change is \"makeup\" which we know for a matter of fact she \"got\" because we're talking about herself here.\n4.

Only North and South Americas together can be called 'continent' because 'continent' is more of a geographical term related to land masses and not countries.\n1. So, out of the available options, there is no way option C, North America and South America, can be the ones with the continent being 'in common'.\n2. Only option 'D', Central and South America, Euro has it, but if you look at a continent map then you'll find countries belonging to Central and South America and Europe are only few countries, like Portugal- a part of Europe and Brazil- a part of South America.\n3.

Among the given choices, \"home\", \"garage\", and \"liberty\" do not make for a viable choice. \"home\" is too vague, and \"liberty\", if describing a storage area, is uncommon.\n5. \"Garage\" is generally not a place that would be dedicated enough to contain a large number of pieces of art and be used for storage or preservation purposes.\n6. \"Studio space\" and \"museum\" are both good choices.  \"Studio space\" allows for a collection of various artwork and some even exhibit art they don't produce to serve as a gallery.\n7.

The characteristics of a gem would not be based on its physical location (e.g. a 'pool hall') or on factors like its weight.\nInput: Where's the best place to see a whale? Choices:  Atlantic Ocean\nRationales: None of the other choices provide information that the best place to observe a whale is in the Atlantic Ocean. The question is purely asking about the geographical place that whales are commonly spotted at.\nInput: Where do people see a blue jay? Choices:  Blue jays are migratory creatures.\nRationales 'The blue jay is migratory' refers to the geographical location that a blue jay could be located at. They cannot easily be seen in one predetermined location. The question is asking us about a possible location where blue jays could be seen.\nInput: Which part of a house would contain the water heater? Choices: Any part", "answer": "D: popularity"}

Hence, the appropriate answer is E: tree.\nAnswer: E tree\n\nInput: It is imperative to remove the dirt from a car if you don't want any fungus to grow there. Which is what? Choices: A: a parasite B: a plant C: a tree D: a weed E: a bacteria\nRationales:1. Paraphrasing the problem statement or sentence, we first see that there is no mention of fungus.\n2. So, the statement refers to removing dirt from a car to prevent fungus or fungi from growing. 3. We then understand the word 'imperative', which refers to something necessary or important.\n4. The question asks to identify which of the provided \"thing\" is necessary or important for not having fungus on your car.\n5. From context, fungus is not good, and its growth is a bad thing.\n6. So, we can eliminate options C: a tree, and D: a weed as they have a positive connotation or can have a useful use in another way.\n7. Option A: a parasitic infection or disease is also not related to the given problem.\n8. Since the car needs to be cleansed to prevent fungus from growing, option B is a plant (fungi are plants), and option E is a bacteria because it can cause growth.\n9. Option E is the correct answer.\nAnswer: E bacteria\n\nInput: What is a good thing to clean out the refrigerator before you leave for vacation? Choices: A potato B a stick of butter C salt D ham E ice cream F milk F plum\nRationales:2. We can make an inference that an appliance containing refrigerated items like a refrigerator can be cleaned.\n3. We can make an assumption that it would be bad to leave items that had bacteria in them for a long time.\n4. An  appliance needs to be regularly cleaned and this could help ensure that bacteria and other germs do not stick to it and leave any residues on edible items.\n5. The refrigerator, specifically, may be prone to such", "answer": "D: feel happy"}

Choices:  Pasta: [1] [2] [3] [4]\n\n- [1] - tomato sauce  [2] - olive oil  [3] - chicken broth  [4] - lemon butter\n\nRationale: 1. The statement makes reference to a 'tomato sauce'. We need to determine how the question pertains to it.\n2. By analysing the choices 1 to 4, we can infer that these are ingredients or cooking components that can be used to cook the pasta.\n3. Therefore, in order to cook the pasta, any of these four ingredients would have to be used.\n4. Now, looking at the question, it's asking for which of these four ingredient choices that the 'tomato sauce' refers to.\n5. The only ingredient in this set that starts with a 'tom' is tomato sauce.\n6. So in conclusion, the answer to the question is 1: the tomato sauce. The options here are not just tomato sauce but pasta: A tomato sauce is used to cook the past\nAnswer: [1] - tomatto sauce\n\nInput: What type of machine can you control remotely without leaving the house?

Choices: \t\t\t\t\t\tA: none B: one C: two D: many\nRationales:\t1) What is the difference between the words'my home' and 'it'?\n2) We know that we are given a choice between four different towns, A, B, C, and D. My home is in the 'woods', which is near to one of these towns.\n4) 'It' implies that our 'home' is one of the four towns, as the options are referring to the people's homes. So, it cannot be'my home', as home is not an object. Also, 'none' is an appropriate option, as woods have many homes.\n5) This leads to the conclusion that'my home' is A. C's answer is the same, as'many' is a very vague value. We can also eliminate D for the same reason as'many'.\n6) This leaves us with the options A and B.\n7) Finally, we can remove B, as the nearest town to the woods does not necessarily have to be the nearest town to our home. The nearest town to the 'woods' is A,'my home' itself.\n8) Therefore, the closest town to my home is A.\n9) A can be shortened to simply 'one'.\n10) The correct answer is 'one' or 'one town'\nAnswer: A. one\n\nInput: What does a wooly mammoth eat?

Choices:  Soup: A: food B: taste  Wine: C: dish D: salad E: sauce\nRationales: From the context, we can infer the following about the soup and the food in general:\n1. As a chef, we can infer that the chef was not referring to the soup as \"food\" - in this case, \"good\" is used to describe a desirable quality of food in general.\n2. Similarly, wine was probably not being referred to by the chef as a \"dish\" - in this case too, \"good\" is qualifying its quality.\n3. Thus, soup and wine, although they appear as being in contrast with one another in the question, were being referred to as food and drink (as they are categorically classified) by the chef.\n4. Moreover, knowing the soup and the alcohol, we can also infer that they were probably the only two options the chef evaluated positively - by having the options, A & B would mean that the chef did not think both were good, by having the options C & D would mean that the chef was not of two minds about the wine, by having options E & F would mean that he was not undecided about what to eat with the soup.\n5.

{"text": "characteristics.\n7. Hence 'tree' is the answer to the question because it's the only location where Marmots with hands can be found.\nAnswer: E(C to E): tree E(A): outside\n\nInput: Where can you find the bird? Choices:  B: tree C: nest D: window E: hole F: door\nRationales: We can deduce that 'bird' refers to a small flying animal, since 'large' is mentioned at the start of the problem, and also because a small bird would be easier to lift from its home by a cat than a large bird.\nMoreover, when cats take possession of animals from their homes, they do so through their mouths, as stated in the problem statement. Hence, cats can either use their mouths or their paws to get birds from their nests, holes, or doors in order to eat them.\nHowever, the only way that they could get a bird from a tree is by climbing to it and lifting it, which is a lot harder than lifting a bird from its nest, hole, or door, and much harder than lifting it off the floor when it was on a table. Therefore, option A is incorrect because it implies that cats can lift a bird from a tree.\nAlternatively, option B is incorrect since the only small or young animal that a cat could lift from a tree and eat is a squirrel.\nOption C cannot be right since a cat would not eat a bird without first either killing it or rendering it defenseless, and even if it did eat it while still alive there would need to be enough room in the cat's stomach so that it could still move and breathe (which a bird would not be able to do when it's sitting on the floor). Hence option C is incorrect.\nOption D cannot be correct since it makes no sense that the cat would try to lift a bird from the hole when its mouth and tongue have been used earlier to dig for and grab a fish that they found in the sea.\nOption E cannot be correct because a bird cannot fit in a hole that a cat has just dug for a fish.\nTherefore, all of the above options are wrong, making option F the best and only answer. Option F implies that cats lift birds off the ground or out of doors.\nAnswer: F: window", "answer": "E: university"}

What attraction might these people be visiting? Choices:  (1) A: library, (2) B: movie theatre (3) C: mansion, (4) D: casino (5) E: amusement park\nRationales: (1). The expression people 'taking advantage of free days' is referring to people, not 'library'. (2), (3) and (4) are unlikely places where people could be taking advantage of free days. (5), on the other hand, is a place where such a situation is easily expected. \n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice item.\n\n### Input: Lots of people could be taking advantage.\n### Demonstraion:\n##### First, identify the structure and the meaning of the sentence.\nStructurally, the sentence is a present active indicative statement followed by the \"could\" phrase, which implies future speculation about an event that could or might take place.\n\nStructure: I saw a shiny red car.\nMeaning: (I saw a shiny, red car).

Choices: A: vacation B: hangout C: attraction D: hangout E: retreat\nRationales: The context of the question is from the perspective of a city planner in need of a public place for people to come together and relax. The given answer choices are describing the location's value proposition. \n1. 'A: vacation' refers to a place for people to go away for some time to rest or enjoy themselves. It doesn't describe a relaxing location that is available for the city dwellers to have a place to rest.\n2. 'B: hangout' means a place where people visit to hang out. While a hangout is relaxing, it's generally a more social activity than a place for simple rest and relaxation.\n3. 'C: attraction' speaks about a place that draws people due to its interesting and unique aspects, so it will be more of a place people visit to see than a place they use to relax.\n4. 'D: hangout' and 'E: retreat' are almost the same. Both imply a place to gather or relax with the company of people. They both qualify as being a good 'hangout' or a relaxing place. \n5. The only difference between the two is that a \"retreat\" implies a place people go to simply get away from their regular hectic lifestyles, not necessarily involving others. \n6. Therefore, the best match is \"D: hangout\" or \"E: retreat\" since they both qualify as good places to hang out with people or a relaxing place in the eyes of a city planner.\nAnswer: B and E: hangout and retreat\n\nInput: The fish swim in the water in what direction?

{"text": "ability.\n7. Therefore. The answer is E: tree.\nAnswer: E; tree\n\nInput: We can't put that in our new house, its too big. Where would we put a what? Choices:   A: bed B: chair C: table D: bookcase E: sofa\nRationales: The question is asking what we can't put in a new house because it's too big.  \n1. Analyzing the choices, we know we can't put it in the bed or the chair. These words refer to individual objects like a bed or a chair.\n2. The word 'table' implies that it also refers to a single item.\n3. Options 'bookcase' and'sofa' are also not suitable choices as they don't fit what we would typically find being referred to as \"too big\".\n4. So, we are left with options 'A: bed' and 'D: bookcase'.  \n5. Combining this with the keyword 'new', we know that the house is not a rental apartment or an owned home that has been relocated elsewhere.\n6. Therefore we can infer that the house is being constructed or built by the person.  \n7. In such an instance, there likely won't be an owner in the house when it's being put together.  \n8. This also supports the context of the new house that was specified earlier. So, we can infer that no person will be in bed in the 'new house'.  \n9. Therefore, we can infer that the keyword 'new house' refers to a construction site or the structure being built by the person.\n10. So, we eliminate option 'A: bed' as the candidate.\n11. The keyword 'too big' doesn't fit with option D: bookcase.  \n12. So, we are finally left with only option E:sofa.  \n13. It is a long time before we put a sofa in a house because it will often come with a living room or lounge area.\n\n### Practice:\n\n> Find the miswritten word or expression in each sentence and click it to read the appropriate correction.\n>\n> 1.

I was curious because he was known where? Choices: \nA: city council B: the white house C: the united nations D: the legislative branch E: the capitol\nRationales:  1. The first problem statement is asking where the mayor was known.\n2. In answering, we need to consider what is meant by where the mayor 'is known'.\n3. The phrase 'was known' indicates a past event, so we can assume that he is not currently in the position.\n4. Also, based on the choice of'resigned' versus 'was resigning', we can guess that whatever he was doing in the past, it's done already.\n5. Hence, he is 'no longer known' in his former position.\n6. Looking at the options given, we can deduce the answer to 'where the mayor was known'.\n7. Since the first part of the question mentions \"heard\" and the second mention \"rumors\", it is likely that the mayor isn't known at the moment in any of the given choices.\n8. It is implied that the mayor is in a new position, perhaps a new job, in which he/it is known.\n9. Based on this logic, the answer must be A: 'city council', B: 'the white house', or 'the united nations' as they are all places where the mayor might currently be known.\n10. We can quickly discount E: The Capitol, as the statement of the mayor resigning, together with the \"were\" choice and \"was known\" indicates that he left his former position and is in a new one. Therefore, the mayor cannot be known at the Capitol currently.\n11. Choosing from the three remaining choices, we need to look at what each says that the mayor is doing now. For each word given, we can infer what position or organization we might be talking about in his/her new role.\n12. The phrase \"city council\" indicates that he was in elected position, so it might be a city government council or mayorship, such as a mayor's office in a city.\n13.

Choices:  A : store B: mall C : store\nRationales: Analyzing the context as a whole, we see that the store was not as big a the mall, but smaller than a department store. \nWe can note that malls are generally larger than stores, and they are usually bigger than department stores.\n1. We rule out 'A: store', because'store' doesn't explain why the store was quite small for a Department Store. 2. We then note the description of the department store being bigger than the store. This does not help us narrow down the choices as the other two options mention the Department Store being bigger.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the department store was much bigger than the store, and the store wasn't as big as the malls. Thus, 'B: mall' and 'C: Department Store' are out of the question.\n4. Finally, we can conclude that the store was bigger than a department store, but wasn't as big or as a large as the mall. Since we don't see a 'D: mall' or an option that refers a mall, 'A: store' would be the only choice as it refers to the store and the mall.\n5.

Tree  \n\n\nInput: Where is it likely to snow? Choices: 1. A: South, 2. B: West, 3. D: Northwest, 4. E: East\nRationales:  1. In the context of snow, the 'South' is the place where it is least likely to occur.\n2. It's also where it will be warmest throughout the year.\n3. Snow will not fall in the south, because if it did it would indicate that it is no longer the summer and the area would be much colder than what is considered to be the north.\n4. The 'northwest' is a colder region where snowfall is more common and it is known for having a dry and freezing weather.\n5. As the statement 'it's likely to snow', indicates that there is a potential for precipitation, which in the context of this question refers to rain.\n6. If it 'rained' it does not mean it is likely to snow. For there to be a snowfall in 'the northwest', one would have to live in a climate that had a four-season climate during which it snowed during the winter time.\n7. 'The East' is not a place where it snows because 'it's likely'. If there was a snowfall it would be because it is winter and that is the season when it snows.\n8. In the winter of the eastern hemisphere, the temperatures are freezing, and one would not be able to live there.\n9. Thus 'Southwest' is the most likely place to where it is 'likely to snow'.\nAnswer: 4. E. southwest\n\n### Instructions: \nGiven the choice from the question we will find the two words in the text that best correspond to 'the choice from the question'.\n\n### Demo:\nInput: What's the most fun and what's the most interesting?

Choices:  It's eating a person A: It's eating meat B: It's huge C: It's eats other fish D: It's going to attack me E: None of the above\nRationales: The question is asking about the problematic nature of the shark.\n1. 'It's huge' simply means that he is a large predator who is a danger.\n2. Also \"It's\" refers to the previous item (shark).\n3. This is a very common error of grammatical structure in writing which we have corrected here.\n4. Therefore the correct answer is B.\nRATIONALES: 1. \"A\", means that he is eating another person. This indicates that the shark is not necessarily an animal that eats fish.\n2. The correct answer would be \"It's eating a fish\", as in the previous paragraph, the shark was eating the human.\n3. \"D\", means that it is going to attack the narrator. However, this is not the point.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is \"B: It's huge\".\nAnswer: B: It's enormous\n\nInput: Where can students get help on a homework assignment for a math class?

But you wouldn't say she was the best what at the game? Choices:  -: chess; A. player  B. chess player  C. at playing chess D. player of chess E. chess-player  F. at chess\nRationales: The sentence could be considered a grammatical question since the structure is a question tag. In grammar, this means that the sentence is a question asked by someone (the verb is present in the present tense).\n- 'Chess' is a common misspelling, instead, use 'chess' (A/B/C/D/E).\n1. The best, not the best what - we have the word 'best', what is the best is correct but we need to know what is the best what. 'Matter' in the options is too vague.\n2. A. Player - A player is a person playing the best what?\n3. B. Chess player - A chess player is a person playing an item referred to by the noun 'chess'- so in other terms we have another player, what is the best player?\n4. C. At playing chess- is incorrect, 'what are they at?' is incorrect.\n5. D. Player of chess is not correct because we need something that is a noun\n6. E.

Choices: A: park B: backyard C: home D: outdoors E: back alley\nRationales:\n1. The question is centred on what the students were doing before they left a playground.\n2. In order to understand what the students were doing, consider the choices presented. Of them all, backyard, home, park, and outdoors are logical places where students would play.\n3. However, back alley isn't relevant because it isn't a location a student would play. Instead, it could be a street they walk to from the playground or a street where they had an errand.\n4. Given the context of playing, the choices of home and backyard do not make sense, because it would be highly unlikely for the students to play at home. Also, there may be a lot of other factors that would dictate the students staying at home - an argument with a sibling, an argument with a parent, unwell, etc.\n5. Therefore park and outdoors are the most likely choices because students are likely to play at a park, or outdoors. Park suggests more than one park so the students must have played at more than one park because they left a playground, so this excludes park. This leaves us with outdoors.\n6. Therefore the correct answer is E: outdoors.\n\n### Exercise: Answer the following multiple choice question to the best of your abilities!\n\n#### Instruction:Answer the questions below.\n\nInput: The teacher decided to test the students, which of these is an appropriate place to administer?

(2) The choice of playground would indicate that the teacher is testing students, and playgrounds aren't suited for testing students. (3) So, playground is an incorrect option. (4) A similar line of reasoning applies to the choice of cafeteria. (5) A classroom can be used to administer tests, but it can either be used", "answer": "D: growth"}

Choices: A: rocks B: tree C: ground D: branches E: ground\nRationales: This is somewhat of a reversal of the previous question, given that we were asked to find an answer choice which excluded certain types of locations. In this question, we're asked to identify a location where squirrels 'can be found' but isn't one where they also 'don't have fur under their belly'. \nThe correct answer must be something where squirrels can be found but don't have fur on their underbelly.\n(D) is a good bet because squirrels are often found running along the ground, but since they have fur coats, this negates Answer (E).\n(B) is also a possibility, as squirrels are found in trees. However, this would put them above the ground - again, not having fur coats is excluded, so we can quickly cross it off our list entirely.\n(C) is discounted since squirrels spend a good deal of time on the ground. If a squirrel is in an elevated position, we can take them off the table instantly.\n(A) looks like the most likely solution, but we actually don't know whether or not squirrels would avoid rocks. \nThis leaves us with Answer (A) as our only viable solution.\nIf we are unable to remove (E) as an answer, we can still eliminate (D).\nAnswer: Rock.\n\nComment: Your solution to the last question is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: \\section{Solution to the first question is C.}\n\n'Demonstration' question is to show what you have understood by following the instruction to complete the instruction. \n\nIncorrect options:\n- This option cannot happen as you aren't suppose to remove any text from the question or the instructions.

Choices: A: trumpet B: drummer C: saxophonist D: bass E: pianist\nRationales: The question revolves around deciding what the right term is to refer to a person who prefers to listen to jazz music.\n1. Generally, 'jazz' has to do with a particular musical genre, but the term can be applied to a person as well.\n2. A saxophonist, drummer, and trumpet are typical instruments that have jazz in their names.\n3. A bass usually refers to an instrument or sometimes to the lowest vocal harmony.\n4. An accomplished pianist can be associated with the term 'jazz', but this does not help in describing a person whose favorite music is 'jazz'.\n5. A pianist can have other favorite genres as well or prefer songs without jazz elements as well.\n6. Therefore the correct term is 'a person whose favorite musical style is jazz'.\n7. Since this is a descriptive term and there is no specific instrument that goes with this musical genre, the most suitable word from the available choices is 'jazz'. Therefore, the answer is E: jazz\nAnswer: E: jazz\n\nInput: If the answer was yes, where was the answer received? Choices: 1. B: street A: carwash 2. C: store B: car 3.

Since 'B: street' is the second choice, we know it's not the answer which is a 'yes'.\n2. Therefore, 'D: beach' is not the answer because beach is 'no'.\n3. Furthermore, 'E: phone' is not the answer.\n4. A 'yes' answer cannot be received on phone.\n5.

Choices: 1. pengines 2. pengines 3. pintengins 4. penguains 5. pengians\nRationales:1. First, analyse the sentence structure of the question. The sentence ends with the question mark, and it is likely that the answer option would be a correct spelling of the word \"penguin\". The word is already in brackets which indicates it is not part of the sentences above and, therefore, is a potential answer option.\n2. The sentence also ends in a question mark, indicating that the answer option will be one of the above words. The word \"penguin\", will have the letters \"p p g u e\", so it is best to eliminate all of the above options.\n3. After ruling all options except option 1, the sentence will end in the question mark and the answer option will be the remaining letter combination.\n4. Given that \"penguin\" has only five letters, the combination ending in \"5\" will be correct.\n5. Therefore the answer option is \"5\".\nAnswer: 5\n\nInput: Which option provides the information on what was invented? Choices:  E: a radio A: television D: car B: camera B: wheel\nRationales:\n1.

This means that an object on a horizontal surface cannot be held by another horizontal surface (the shelf).\nThis interpretation is untenable since the shelf doesn't physically support the cheese but rather, holds the cheese by its gravity.\nThe second way to take the information is that a shelf is used to support an object.\nOn this interpretation, 'the shelf'", "answer": "E: fabric store"}

Tie the left shoelace with the right shoe and then switch over. B. Tie left shoelace over right shoe but don't switch over. C. Tie each shoe by using both hands. D. Make sure that shoelaces are pulled taut before you tie. E. Tie right shoe with right shoelace and left shoe with left.\nRationales:1. We have to determine the correct way to tie shoes.\n2. In order to do that, we need to observe what the children were being taught about tying shoes.\n3. The children weren't taught to tie the shoe using both hands or using shoelaces only.\n4. Tying the left shoe with the right shoe then switching both over is incorrect; the question has already established that the children will be using only one shoe at a time.\n5. Not pulling taut shoelaces before tying them isn't a method either.\n6. Finally, tying each shoe with both hands isn't a suitable option either.\n7. Thus, the only two options with valid methods of shoe-tying are the options B and D.\n8. We can eliminate option B, as it doesn't require switching over to the other shoe because the instructions are to tie the left shoelace over the right foot and then to switch over to the other foot.\n9. Option D is a correct method for tying shoes as it involves pulling the shoelaces taut before tying them. Thus, the answer is D.\nAnswer: D. Make the shoelaces tails and pull tight before you tie.\n\nInput: What are the 10 largest islands in the world? Choices :  A. Sumatra, Greenland, Borneo, Hispaniola Choices B.

Choices: A: A country B: A country other than New Zealand C: A town D: The same place E: New Zealand\nRationales: The question focuses on the men and asks how it is possible that all of them are from the same place if they're all from different countries. \n\n\nIt's important to note the use of 'all' in conjunction with the words 'never'.\n\nThe question infers that the men have been in New Zealand, known Danny, and all come from a single country despite having a different citizenship.\n \nFrom the options available it is understood that C: A town and E: New Zealand are not suitable solutions to this conundrum. New Zealand is the place that all the men mentioned in the question know. So it cannot be a possible place to be from while being from the same place that the people are from. Similarly, any town that only a maximum of four people can come from is unlikely to be a place from which these men are from if there are no men mentioned in the question that aren't from other countries. \n\nFrom the information discussed above, A: A country and B: A country other then New Zealand are the only viable options as they have the information that the writer has given the reader so far. Therefore, the answers are A: A country and A: A country other than that where Danny is from while the men are from another place. \n\nAnswer: C: A country and A : A country other than New zealand\n\nInput: The answer is that she is happy.

Choices:  I: reef A: sea lion II: great white D: whale III: seal C: fish E: whale shark\nRationales: \"Shark in the sentence refers to a specific type of animal \u2013 a big animal, not necessarily scary looking. Some examples of scary-looking sharks would be 'Great White', 'Whale', or 'Whale Shark',\" says @jhong9.\n1. A'reef' is the bottom of the ocean that is made up of rocks and corals of all sizes and shapes, and is a type of habitat where various organisms such as sharks live, so there is not a lot of similarity between the word'reef' and'shark'.\n2. 'Sea lions' is a type of animal, but they are a seal (mammals) and not a fish; also, there is also no similarity between sea lions and sharks.\n3. 'Fish' is a type of ocean organism and also not similar to sharks.\n4. 'Sea lion' is not a synonym or word that means the same as'shark'.\n5.

A: eat all insects present 2. B: let it climb where it wants 3. C: prevent it from walking on you 4. D: throw a net on it 5. E: provide it with clean water\nRationales:   1. We know that spiders are insects, they eat insects, and we know that they commonly inhabit webs, thus we can deduce that the best way to help the spider is feeding it insects.\n2. This answer has no rational or logical connection to the question.\n3. This answer states that spiders cannot walk but then this can happen when it climbs, so it is not the right statement to make.\n4. This answer has no logical connection to the question and is not the best answer choice.\n5. The spider has to climb where it wants to walk. It has no intention of walking on other parts of its body that can be more conveniently navigated by the spider.\n6.

The choices are: cabbage, watermelon, banana, and zucchini.\n\nAnswering this question entails the inference and analysis of the food types as well as their placement in certain environments. The options given are cabbage, watermmelon, banana, zucchini. The water has properties or characteristics that certain foods are more likely to come across.\n\nAs a result, we are likely to find watermelon near water. A watermelon cannot survive without water for too long. Hence, one can only find this food in places near water.\nSimilarly, certain watermelon growers place their watermelons close to water and hence, the food item is likely to be near water.\n\nOption B Cabbage is a fresh produce vegetable. Fresh produce vegetables are likely to be near water if exposed to direct sunlight. If not exposed to direct sunlight, they can be kept in water (i.e. hydroponic or greenhouse).\n\nHence, cabbage is likely to be near the water.\nOption D Banana is a tropical fruit that grows in warm climates. Bananas need a warm climate to grow fruit and are not likely to be grown in cold climates.\nHence, bananas are unlikely to be found near water.\n\nHence, banana cannot be found near water. Option E Zucchini is a vegetable that grows in soil and does not need water to grow fruit. Although zucchini plant may be grown near water, Zucchini itself may not be found near water. If zucchini plant is grown in the ground, its fruit is harvested and can be found on a counter or kitchen/dining table.

B: Heart disease\n3.D: atherosclerotic disease\n4.E: atheroscleronic disease \nRationales: The question is asking for an explanation of a term called \"Atherosclerotic disease\".\nIn medical sciences, there are typically two ways of defining a term.\n1. Using the term or keyword in full (e.g atherosclerotic)\n2. Using a shorter phrase or term that essentially has the same meaning (e.g heart disease)\nWe know using the term or keyword (atherosclerotic)  is one way of providing information. However, using a shorter phrase or term (heart disease) that essentially has the same or an underlying meaning can also be used.\nSince the phrase atherosclerotic refers to a disease, let's look at the given options to find where the disease \"heart disease\" can be found in the paragraph.\n\nOption 1:\nThe first option states that the term or keyword has been stated in full.\nTherefore, it's eliminated as one of the options.\nOption 2:\nThe second option seems to be the same as the question because it says that the term \"heart disease\" has been found, therefore we can say that this is the correct option.\nOption 3:\nThe third option states that the phrase or term that essentially or fundamentally provides the same or the same underlying meaning of the longer name is heart disease.\nSo we're left with two options for a correct answer (1 or 2).\nAnswer: D: Atherosclerotic disease.\n\nInput: The man said \"I think it's wrong to believe things in a literal way.\" What did the man think was wrong about believing things, in a literal way,?

Friend\nRationales: For this riddle, we should look at each item separately to determine if it's relevant.\n1. Firstly, there are three items that cannot be a friend in this instance (animals, garden and'mine').\n2. Considering the question \"my,\" it's likely that the pronoun \"mine\" should pertain to a dog because a dog is an animal and is, most generally, \"mine.\"\n3. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Animal.\n4. The second set is animal, garden, my and friend.\n5. The only item that's not a friend is the word, \"friend.\"\n6.

The teacher responded by saying \"I have no intention of accommodating you\" \n\n### Rationales: \nRationale 1.  The teacher's statement \"I have no intention...\" can be logically analyzed as \"There is no intention to agree,\" or \"There has been no previous agreement to this\".\nRationale 2. Considering reason 1, we know that an \"accommodation\" was not reached between teacher and student, or that the student wasn't convinced by his arguments.\nRationale 3.  There were previously two options: the student's arguments and the teacher's stance.  The arguments did not convince the teacher, whereas the teacher's stances did not convince the student to be accommodating with his teacher. \n\n### Answer:\nThe word 'accommadation' can be best replaced with 'disagreement.'\n\nAnswer: There has been no agreement between the teacher and the student.\n\n### Task :\nAdapt is to modify or modify.\n\n### Demo :\nInput: I can't adapt to hot weather.

The context of the question makes it obvious that the reason these pills are not whole isn't because they are unpopular or broken for small pieces to be eaten.\n2. Similarly, the pills are not broken because the doctor gave a piece to test and it's not to reduce/eliminate a certain dosage. \n3. The context also excludes 'A: They contain small pieces' and 'B: help to get better taste'.\n4. This leaves us with three options D: A doctor gave a break to be tested, E: The patient wants a smaller dosages. \n\nD : Doctor gave a piece to be test implies that doctors often break part of a pill to be tested.

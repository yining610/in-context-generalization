It's not always useful to see \"this is too hard\" because we can't help you unless we know why.\n\nComment: I've updated the description. I hope that clarifies the task a bit better.\n\nComment: You seem to have asked multiple times and gotten conflicting answers.  The problem is two-fold.  First, your description is too vague, and you didn't provide enough example answers that follow your directions - only that they seem to get it wrong, which can work against you.  Second, if you have asked multiple questions and have received multiple responses for each one that you don't think work, you can only accept one of them; however, if you don't know which answer is the one you want, you can't mark your own answer as an \"accepted\" answer.\n\nComment: Okay so I have been trying to write my first answer, but I'm having trouble understanding the question fully. I feel like the instruction and demonstration are too similar, and I'm trying to figure out why they even need to be the same.\n\nComment: The instructions could be left the same, but it would make sense if the actual demonstration is different for every question.  For instance, one of the questions for the 'input' part of the demonstration shows 'D' and needs you to answer E.  If the instructions were the just same as the demonstration, one would be getting the question/answer backwards most of the time.  That said, I don't see why it's necessary to use the demonstration.  I would suggest that all you need to do is give a sample 'correct' answer for the input 'question' and answer options (the demonstration step).\n\nComment: Okay, let me try breaking it down to the basic.

I chose the 1/8th-inch probe, and was a bit disappointed to learn that the doctor didn't have the 1/8-inch camera on hand. But it turned out to be no big deal, though I didn't realize this until the nurse told me afterward. The main thing is of course that no matter which one I choose, my body should be just fine afterward.\n\n### Response 1:\nThere seems to be no difference between the cameras, because both the 1/10-inch and 1/8- inch camera are still too big. The last time the nurse told me that no matter what camera I choose, my end will be fine or without side-effects. This means that there would still be a need for surgery, even if I choose the smaller end.\n\n### Authored By: @amg0222/Rosslyn Y.", "answer": "E: may laugh"}

{"text": "I believe the fast but expensive way to ship small cargo is a plane. Air transportation is very fast but expensive. If the cargo is of high value, it is well worth the high expense of air freight. A ship's hold can carry large cargo, but it is slow as the cargo is heavy and requires a lot of energy to bring it onboard. A boat and a truck cannot carry the same weight as a cargo planes.\n\n### Response (Part 2)\nBecause an airplane can carry a large amount of cargo, if it is of high value, the high cost for the airfare is a small price to pay.

{"text": "When the question says \"Why is this person not...\" this means the reason must be directly related to their situation. So even though music is a reason to not do something, we can't use it as an appropriate response here.\n\nYou don't always know what is going on by looking at a character, so we should only use what we know about them. If one character can have several conditions that would prevent them from listening to music, then we can't just say \"to relax\" because we don't know for sure if that is what's preventing them from listening to music (maybe they don't have time to relax, for example).\n\nSince it's unclear why the person is not listening to music, we'll use one of our best guesses. If there is a chance you could be wrong or off-topic, it's better to avoid an answer. Also note there are many possibilities for why the character may not be listening to music (such as not being able to, not having a way to, or there simply not being music playing currently).\n\nSo, because we don't known what's happening, I'd like to use the most likely reason: the character may not be able to listen to music.

{"text": "```\nHey! I wanted to let you know you can find some plumbing at oil refineries you probably have no use of if you are thirst. As for oil refineries, oil is not a liquid, it is a gas. So, you would have to have someplace to put it first. And if you are thirst you may not be able to drive there. And, if you are a plumber you probably won't be working with plumbing. So I would just not answer. However, if you were talking to a plumber that does not know how to find plumbing, it would probably be something they want, so you could point them in the right direction. You can find pens with writing pens. Write a few sentences and then you can add it to paper and put it into your backpack. It would depend on how far back you wanted to look for them. I mean, most people bring their pens with them when they leave the house. But, if they write a lot, they would probably leave some, though they may not be branded as they would most likely buy their own and get rid of the old ones they had. If you are looking for a writing pen with your school name branded on it, you could try asking the secretary of the school and if they don't know then I would say that I will just pass a pen, you can use it.\n```", "answer": "C: happiness"}

Your email will be evaluated for grammar, syntax, spelling, clarity, and tone.*\n\n### Outline:\n*Begin by thanking your client for the task and provide some context.*\n\n*Use a short block structure to provide your answer.*\n\n#### Paragraph:\nIf the person is working, then the person is in a good position and the person will get things done. If the person is tiredness then the person will try their best but likely could not do anything about their bad situation. The person has to have energy and momentum to be able to work hard which is why it is important for the person not to begin working until they have energy and momentum. This will allow the person to accomplish tasks that they are set out to do because when the person is tired it will be difficult for the person to complete any large tasks. In most cases if the person was at a work event such as a business meeting then it could be a good thing if the person wanted to talk to the people at the event because then the person could get to know their prospective employers better if they are not already familiar with the person. The people with high numbers and large teams at large events usually will not try to get to know new people but rather will try to push their own people or will stick with their friends/contacts. People with large teams are focused on winning and are trying to keep their reputations high or trying to stay on the winning company or team. There are many benefits to getting to know people at business events because it might benefit the person in the future but the person should not attend the event if they need to be at a certain work place at a specific time for example if the person was required to be at work at a certain time because if they missed that deadline then the person will be fired from their position.\n\n### Bonus Tasks:\n#### Complete:A person is in the process of looking for a place to stay.\n\n#### Review:\nWhat is one of the best ways to meet people when you\u2019re alone?

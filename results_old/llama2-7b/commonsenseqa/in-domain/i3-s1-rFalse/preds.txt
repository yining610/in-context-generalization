Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>Input: Where might I find pens with a company logo? Choices:  A: office B: on a pencil C: write sentences on paper D: school E: backpack<n>Answer: A: office<n><n>### Input:How can you get in shape if there is no land nearby? Choices:  A: swim B: jog C: excercise D: work out E: rock climb<n><n>### Response:		Answer with a sentence that accurately completes the request and makes sense.<n><n>Comment: This question, right now, has no chance of becoming a quality answer because no one knows how to get started with the task.  If possible, please start with a more detailed description of what makes this task so difficult to create an answer.  It's not always useful to see "this is too hard" because we can't help you unless we know why.<n><n>Comment: I've updated the description. I hope that clarifies the task a bit better.<n><n>Comment: You seem to have asked multiple times and gotten conflicting answers.  The problem is two-fold.  First, your description is too vague, and you didn't provide enough example answers that follow your directions - only that they seem to get it wrong, which can work against you.  Second, if you have asked multiple questions and have received multiple responses for each one that you don't think work, you can only accept one of them; however, if you don't know which answer is the one you want, you can't mark your own answer as an "accepted" answer.<n><n>Comment: Okay so I have been trying to write my first answer, but I'm having trouble understanding the question fully. I feel like the instruction and demonstration are too similar, and I'm trying to figure out why they even need to be the same.<n><n>Comment: The instructions could be left the same, but it would make sense if the actual demonstration is different for every question.  For instance, one of the questions for the 'input' part of the demonstration shows 'D' and needs you to answer E.  If the instructions were the just same as the demonstration, one would be getting the question/answer backwards most of the time.  That said, I don't see why it's necessary to use the demonstration.  I would suggest that all you need to do is give a sample 'correct' answer for the input 'question' and answer options (the demonstration step).<n><n>Comment: Okay, let me try breaking it down to the basic. Input: The correct answer to this question is "C", "excercise". The answer that would be considered wrong but could be easily corrected would be "E", "work out".

I chose the 1/8th-inch probe, and was a bit disappointed to learn that the doctor didn't have the 1/8-inch camera on hand. But it turned out to be no big deal, though I didn't realize this until the nurse told me afterward. The main thing is of course that no matter which one I choose, my body should be just fine afterward.<n><n>### Response 1:<n>There seems to be no difference between the cameras, because both the 1/10-inch and 1/8- inch camera are still too big. The last time the nurse told me that no matter what camera I choose, my end will be fine or without side-effects. This means that there would still be a need for surgery, even if I choose the smaller end.<n><n>### Authored By: @amg0222/Rosslyn Y.

Choices:  A: airplane B: ship's hold C: boat D: truck E: train<n><n>### Response:		<n>I believe the fast but expensive way to ship small cargo is a plane. Air transportation is very fast but expensive. If the cargo is of high value, it is well worth the high expense of air freight. A ship's hold can carry large cargo, but it is slow as the cargo is heavy and requires a lot of energy to bring it onboard. A boat and a truck cannot carry the same weight as a cargo planes.<n><n>### Response (Part 2)<n>Because an airplane can carry a large amount of cargo, if it is of high value, the high cost for the airfare is a small price to pay. With ships, and the weight of the cargo, the price is cheap for this mode of transportation. Both a boat and a truck are useful, but slow.

Choices:  A: fall asleep B: relaxation C: deafness D: bored E: calm<n><n>### Response:		<n>When the question says "Why is this person not..." this means the reason must be directly related to their situation. So even though music is a reason to not do something, we can't use it as an appropriate response here.<n><n>You don't always know what is going on by looking at a character, so we should only use what we know about them. If one character can have several conditions that would prevent them from listening to music, then we can't just say "to relax" because we don't know for sure if that is what's preventing them from listening to music (maybe they don't have time to relax, for example).<n><n>Since it's unclear why the person is not listening to music, we'll use one of our best guesses. If there is a chance you could be wrong or off-topic, it's better to avoid an answer. Also note there are many possibilities for why the character may not be listening to music (such as not being able to, not having a way to, or there simply not being music playing currently).<n><n>So, because we don't known what's happening, I'd like to use the most likely reason: the character may not be able to listen to music. This means I'd prefer responses like A-C, where listening to music is not an option for some reason. I chose A.<n><n>### Input:"The company I work for is pretty cool.

Choices:  A: crash B: living C: slow down D: carry people E: speed up<n><n>### Response:		<n>There is an interesting story behind the development of the cabin. The first airplane that the Wright Brothers made did not have a nose wheel. This meant that the front of the plane rested directly on the ground. With no landing gear, the cockpit was right in front of the pilot. This was not a good design. The Wright Brothers later made a cabin that was enclosed and separated from the cockpit. When the plane was taxiing, the front wheels (called the nose wheel) could be retracted below the surface of the airplane.

Choices:  A: obtaining information B: exchange of ideas C: sharing information D: conversation E: gathhering of information<n><n>### Response:		<n>You may be looking for this in the wrong place. Oil refineries are not going to be of much use in terms of water. As such, one is unlikely to find a water fountain at an oil refinery (no matter how much you might have wanted to). There is also no point drinking oil even if one wanted to. All of these places would serve as incentives for a thirsty person to look somewhere else. Similarly, a pen without a company logo would also be of little use for a writer. This is because they are still going to need some company to look into the writing process.<n><n>### Question 2.<n><n><n>How did you do?

Choices:  A: sorrow B: paying bills C: happiness D: frustration E: spending money<n><n>### Response:		<n>```<n>Hey! I wanted to let you know you can find some plumbing at oil refineries you probably have no use of if you are thirst. As for oil refineries, oil is not a liquid, it is a gas. So, you would have to have someplace to put it first. And if you are thirst you may not be able to drive there. And, if you are a plumber you probably won't be working with plumbing. So I would just not answer. However, if you were talking to a plumber that does not know how to find plumbing, it would probably be something they want, so you could point them in the right direction. You can find pens with writing pens. Write a few sentences and then you can add it to paper and put it into your backpack. It would depend on how far back you wanted to look for them. I mean, most people bring their pens with them when they leave the house. But, if they write a lot, they would probably leave some, though they may not be branded as they would most likely buy their own and get rid of the old ones they had. If you are looking for a writing pen with your school name branded on it, you could try asking the secretary of the school and if they don't know then I would say that I will just pass a pen, you can use it.<n>```

Choices:  A: vent B: think C: shouting D: work off E: exercise<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>It sounds like you are asking about the release of energy in one's muscles, so no, a vent will not release energy mainly in your muscles, nor will shouting, work off, or exercise. <n><n>The correct answer is think. A person cannot generate power in their body and release it by thinking. Thoughts require electrical signals and chemicals that travel to the brain, but they don't do so at the same time that electrical signals and chemical reactions are occurring in the muscles. The only thing that can happen is when a person thinks about a task that it is not possible to think and do, so a person cannot release energy mainly in their muscles, but think.<n><n>

Your email will be evaluated for grammar, syntax, spelling, clarity, and tone.*<n><n>### Outline:<n>*Begin by thanking your client for the task and provide some context.*<n><n>*Use a short block structure to provide your answer.*<n><n>#### Paragraph:<n>If the person is working, then the person is in a good position and the person will get things done. If the person is tiredness then the person will try their best but likely could not do anything about their bad situation. The person has to have energy and momentum to be able to work hard which is why it is important for the person not to begin working until they have energy and momentum. This will allow the person to accomplish tasks that they are set out to do because when the person is tired it will be difficult for the person to complete any large tasks. In most cases if the person was at a work event such as a business meeting then it could be a good thing if the person wanted to talk to the people at the event because then the person could get to know their prospective employers better if they are not already familiar with the person. The people with high numbers and large teams at large events usually will not try to get to know new people but rather will try to push their own people or will stick with their friends/contacts. People with large teams are focused on winning and are trying to keep their reputations high or trying to stay on the winning company or team. There are many benefits to getting to know people at business events because it might benefit the person in the future but the person should not attend the event if they need to be at a certain work place at a specific time for example if the person was required to be at work at a certain time because if they missed that deadline then the person will be fired from their position.<n><n>### Bonus Tasks:<n>#### Complete:A person is in the process of looking for a place to stay.<n><n>#### Review:<n>What is one of the best ways to meet people when you’re alone? What would your client do if they started to experience a headache? If you were traveling far away for vacation but needed to work what would you ask a friend to do while you are away?<n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: pocket B: office supply store C: friend's house D: desk drawer E: city hall<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer to this question is "D: desk drawer".<n><n>### Additional feedback:<n>>The answer to this question _should be_ "D: desk draw". I am unsure why this was chosen, because D is incorrect. I am unsure if a single line can only have one correct response, but maybe it's not a good learning opportunity. I am curious why it chose "B: office supply store", considering how this answer is not only not what you want to be doing as you are on the go, but it is also not relevant as to where you might be looking for this item.<n>The only explanation for these answers I can come up with is that maybe "A: pocket" is related to pens. But, this only makes sense for fountain pens. I am not sure if it relates to ball-point pens in some way. And I am confused by why "B: office supply" is chosen, because this is not in place of "D: desk", but rather as a substitution for the word "D:." Also, not really sure why this is the case, but every answer to this question has an incorrect spelling, so maybe there is a bug?<n>

When it is not raining, the water can go underground and be found many miles away and be re-used for other things. For example, if we are thirsty and drink some of it, then it goes inside the body through the stomach and is used to stay alive and keep the blood flowing. <n><n>### Instrections5:<n>Instructions: After we have left the shoreline, describe some of the things you would likely see on the beach.<n>Response: After we have left shoreline (the edge of the beach) then I would notice that there were many sand dunes.

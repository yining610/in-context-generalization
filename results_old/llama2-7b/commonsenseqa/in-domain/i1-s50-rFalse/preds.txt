This will help the computer do very small tasks more easily so other computers can handle other tasks like A.I.<n><n>In general A.I. is helpful to people. If someone wanted to send text to another person and said machine can translate what was said. I can imagine the people sending and receiving the messages. I think that in the future A.I. can be helpful and can also be dangerous as it can grow out of control. We should be careful of letting things control us without our knowledge if we let the control A.I. take power over us we will not be able to control it.<n><n>#### Example: 1-20 of 21<n>```<n>I think that the machine should not choose a.i because its dangerous and it doesn't serve the people instead the machine control the people that's why should the machine not have  a.i because if the machine have  a.i and there are a.i it will control us and we will not be able do anything.<n>```<n>Example 2:<n>```<n>For me personally they can be helpful or dangerous, i think if they are helpful then we should have them but if they are too dangerous they will cause trouble and make things worse.<n>```<n>Example: <n>```<n>For me, ai’s can be good, we need people to do things. <n>Some people have disabilities that don’t give them enough strength to do the tasks like cleaning dishes or cooking and some people don’t have much free because they have jobs and their free time doesn’t give them enough time to clean their house or to make food.  <n>so we need this robots to do all the work for us but if the government gets their hands on these robots that have a lot of information about us then it has the power to control our life. <n>and this makes the government have more control over us and we won’t be in control of our lives anymore. <n>```<n>

Choices:  A: see king B: hello C: meow D: drink water E: live many years<n><n>### Response:		<n>* The code would look like this:<n><n>```<n>@param question (String)<n>def respond(question):<n>```<n><n>* Then you would have a `while True:` loop and inside of it, a `input = int(raw_input(userInput)):` where `userInput` is whatever the user put.<n>* Next, you would use these variables to test if the input made sense:<n><n>```<n>if userInput > 0 :<n>	print("Invalid input!")<n>	return<n>elif userInput == 0 :<n>	return<n>```<n>* After, you would have to get a `Choice` variable that would have all the options. After, you would loop through all the options, and if the user input matched with it, you would print out the response.<n><n>### Code<n><n>```<n>import random<n>answer=input("What would you like to buy?")<n><n>while True:<n>    input = int(raw_ input(name))<n><n>    if input >0 :<n>        print("Invalid input!") <n>        continue<n>    elif input == 0 : <n>        return<n><n>if answer == "car":<n>     num = random.randint(1, 10)<n>     if num == 2: <n>       print("20  bucks")<n>     elif num == 3:                 <n>       print("14 bucks")<n>     else<n>      print("5  bucks")<n>if answer =="soda" :<n>     print("1.75")<n><n>```<n><n>### Reflection:<n><n>* First of all, there were no errors in the code. However, when I went to make all the while True loop, I forgot one thing. To loop through the choices. There are 2 parts for the loops.<n><n><n>* Another way that I could have done this was, instead of having the user input, I could have put in a few options and see if the user input any of those things. But there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages but choosing the way of having the user input it. Also the other way would be more simple, but not the best option.<n><n><n>* In general, I feel like I could work on writing better code because even though this was pretty good code, it would be better to see if there are any other ways to make the code even more

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>### Input:The new kitten hadn't gotten used to what it was allowed to climb on in most rooms, so the owned kept the bedroom door what? Choices:  A: opened B: closed C: found at shower D: falling down E: locked<n><n>### Response:		<n>The new kitten hadn’t gotten used to climbing on what it was allowed to, and after a good nap there was a surprise waiting for it. The bedroom door was left open for this reason. The cat was very pleased with the new found freedom to do as it wished, but it accidentally fell. It rolled over as it fell, getting more scratches in the process. If the door had been closed, this sadness could have been avoided.<n><n>### Sample Response<n>```<n>When an animal is not familiar with what they are allowed to do in each room, it can cause confusion. When this confusion occurs, the owner wants to make sure their life gets back to the normal state, so they will generally try to close off areas that can be a problem for a cat. In this case, the owner didn’t follow through in trying to prevent problems, and accidently fell over because the door was accidentally open. Had the owner followed through in protecting the cat, the cat might not have fallen.<n>```<n><n>### Exercise A <n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>### Exercises that are solved:<n><n>* [Exercise](http://www.repl.it/@SnowyCoder/A/002)<n>

Choices:  A: charming B: space shuttle C: house D: train station E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n>You could either find air that has been recently breathed by many people:<n><n>- At a train station - This air has often been recently breathed by large groups of people. As people board a train they often leave behind a lot of carbon dioxide, which could fill up a train station if not filtered through air circulation and ventilation.<n><n>- On a subway - As humans commute to and leave work, they all breathe air that has been previously breathed by numerous other humans over the course of the day. Some humans that take public transport may breathe the same air as other humans who ride the same route every day.<n><n>- In a shopping centre or mall - In a mall’s central atrium, humans will frequently pass through a large number of doors for many years continuously rebreathing the same air.<n><n>- A museum, library, restaurant or bookstore - These buildings commonly have high ceilings allowing air to circulate around a lot of people for a long period of time. This gives the air a chance to meet many other humans before finally leaving the building.<n><n>- In an office building or apartment block - In these buildings air is circulated around many areas over many hours each day. This allows the same air to flow past many humans over that course of day. Air can be breathed in by large groups of people over the course of time in an office building.<n><n>- On the surface of a planet - On Earth air is circulated constantly by the wind and water cycle. Humans are breathing fresh air from places that are many thousands of kilometres away from them when they breathe.<n><n>

Choices:  A: grand casino B: large room C: restaurant D: country club E: lobby<n><n>### Response:		B: large room<n><n>### Explanation:<n>  Choice: A: grand casino      This is incorrect because Grand Casinos are not appropriate places to have a reception given its <n>  decorum.                   Choice: B: large room      This is correct given that a reception requires a large space to <n>  accommodate many people (large room). The choices C, D, and E are incorrect by themselves and also incorrect when paired <n>  with the first answer.

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>### Input:As a human in a large northeastern city, where can you see animals? Choices:  A: zoo B: workplace C: sky D: new york city E: many places<n><n>### Response:		<n>While the only place I have encountered animals was at the zoo, I believe it is important for humans to have a place where they can see living things as they live free. The zoo is an artificial enclosure. Therefore the animals do not have the freedom to interact with one another and interact with their environment. The human’s only benefit from going to the zoo is to see wild animals; this interaction is a one-way exchange. Many of their behavioral traits have been extinguished in order to house them comfortably in this artificial manner. So, it is my belief that the park is the place where humans should interact with animals that have a normal, natural life. <n><n>### Instuction:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Input: If you lived in New York city, is there an advantage to living in a suburb or a city? Choices: Suburb: Better transportation, parks, recreation, noisy, etc.  City: noisy, limited parking & transportation.<n><n>### Demo:<n>Input: If you lived in a place like New York City is it better to live in a crowded city or a crowded suburb? Choices: City: crowded, too expensive Suburb: crowded.<n><n>### Response<n>While there are arguments both for and against living in a city like New York, I believe there are many disadvantages. The crowds of the city can make you feel anxious and can be overwhelming. When I travel, I do not feel the need to keep looking behind me to see if a crowd of people is coming. I believe having space to live is not as important to people who are single or have families as far as financial needs. The lack of space seems to be a downside of living in a city, but I see people constantly making due with limited space. In addition, New York City would not be my place of choice to live because of how busy and noisy the city is. However, if it comes down to it, I know there are many advantages to living in a city. In conclusion, I believe it is better to live in a city like Newyork than in a suburb.<n><n>### Input and Display<n>If you lived in a dense city like New York, would you rather live in the center?

Chooses A-D as they have something to do with italian cuisine, however there is no such thing as marinara only used for that. The correct answer would be E as you can't cook a sauce when it's empty. An AI would have to have knowledge about different cuisines like italian cuisine that a sauces that are only cooked in italian cuisine have that name and can not be cooked by other means. Also, the AI would have to know that a sauce when it is not being cooked is not useful and it must be kept in the cupboard.<n>Human beings tend to not be very formal sometimes when describing problems, an AI should know how to decode ambiguous questions for the best possible answer.<n>

Choices:  A: to be heard B: receive gifts C: understand themselves D: good things in life E: acknowledgment<n><n>### Response:		Why might a person go to seek counseling? (A: to be heard, B:gain understanding about themselves, C: to get rid of past issues, D: to get an acknowledgement(s)). Counseling is a service that helps people by assisting with understanding themselves and their life experiences in a way that helps to make positive changes. Some of the things you might be wondering why one may seek to go and get counseling is to seek out understanding concerning an issue that is effecting their life, such as mental health concerns, relationship with a person or even a particular topic. One reason for this is: " to have an unbiased and objective view of your perspective" (Counseling.com website.). "It is important to understand the person with whom you are talking. If you understand the person, you are more likely to know how to treat him or her" (AskDrKim website.).<n><n>### Instructions:Why might a person be in a place of need?  Choices:  A) To receive medical needs B) Counseling C) Employment needs D) Other<n><n>### Response answer: There are many reasons a person could be in need. Some people in need go into programs with the intent to receive different employment opportunities or counseling. Some people need assistance, not just counseling, to be able to get on their feet and take on new challenges that a job can offer.  Some needs are more in need in other aspects, but counseling is a great help when it comes to many areas in life, not just the aspects of employment. Some of these help people gain a better understanding of themselves and their life experiences to make better decisions that can help them to create a better quality of life for themselves.<n><n>### Question answer: The question above asked, “Why might a person want to go to a doctor for medical needs?” I think counseling services is a similar profession. Some of the services that mental health can offer a person are to help them understand themselves better to help them work through issues and life experiences that have been difficult to comprehend. Not only is mental health services a place for people to get to understand themselves better, but it is also a place for people to be supported in the process of life changes. <n><n>### Instutions: How much do you know mental health needs?<n><n>### Resources used to answer

Choices:  A: having appointements B: being late C: have time to think D: time consuming E: impatience<n><n>### Response:		<n>In many countries doctors don't charge as much for appointments with them. People who don't have their own doctor often have to make appointments to see one and waiting for an appointment can cost money. A lot of people can only see their doctor during their lunch break and it doesn't really take the doctor long to see them. They will wait if they need to which is often true for people who don't even have a doctor. For reasons like this people are often late for an appointment with their doctor and they have to reschedule which can be very inconvenient if it's been set in your head as a day to do important work.<n>

Choices A: sit down B.make mistakes C: have sex   D: reproduce E:excrete<n><n>**Response**:Humans are animals who require food to exist. They eat animals. To do this they must hunt and fight other animals or search for food. Humans do not have fur and so do not need to hibernate. Instead, because they are mammals, humans take care of their young. Human babies require their mothers to feed them so adults must work to earn money to do this. This may include hunting and fighting. Humans do this often, so hunters must learn how to do it well, and so men may practice until they are experts in order to have the highest chance of killing animals. They fight with many different weapons, including arrows, rocks and spears. They also sometimes fight using weapons they have built, like long, spiked sticks with sharp points. Humans also fight many battles to defend their homes and countries. Hunting and fighting requires strength, and a strong body is a good one to have. Some humans make mistakes or make poor choices when they are tired. When this happens, they may lose fights and their children may die. They may also lose access to their homes and land, when this happens they go to other areas and hunt and fight.<n><n>**Input**:"Humans live in buildings" Answer A: Building B: houses C: homes D: flat E: houses"<n><n>**Response**"Humans live in houses"<n><n>**Input**"When humans enter a building what happens?"<n><n>**Response**<n>"When they get home they go to sleep and then they wake up.

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>### Input:What makes people happy when it is surprising and unexpected? Choices:  A: joke B: humor C: frightened D: fight E: laughter<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>There are different types of laughter when it comes to joy. A joke was one of the types of laughter I thought of and so I went to where jokes originate from. A joke originates from a type of "convention", which is a way of doing something. A joke typically requires a set of people, who all speak the same language, that are not offended by the content of the joke. A joke typically includes something that is considered funny or unusual for that particular group of people. A joke is not as much about the joke itself as it's the social aspect of it and who one can be with while telling that joke. It seems like a joke can also be a way to connect people together. The reason I thought of laughter was because I went to Disney Land this summer and I noticed that I laughed more when I was with other people than when I was with other children. In fact, there was a point where I felt stressed out about my surroundings, but then I decided to let go of my situation and instead think about other more enjoyable things. That's when I began to laugh again with my friends. That's when the laughter started to disappear from my body. I noticed that laughter came back to me when I was around people I liked. The type of people I chose to be around was different from the type of people I was around prior to this time. The type of people who I laughed at prior to this time would often be different than the people I chose to spend time with during the first few days of this summer. The type of people that I laughed with the most would be those who were of a similar ethnic background to myself. I was surprised that I had not realized that there was a social aspect to laughter. This type of laughter reminded me of the movie "Meet The Parents", which is a movie where a family goes to meet their prospective in-laws for the first time and everything goes wrong. It seems like laughter is also a way to bond people together.<n><n>### Input<n><n>What can people do to help those who need it?

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>### Input:Where can you find a movie theater along with other stores in one placE? Choices:  A: downtown area B: urban area C: new york city D: shopping mall E: military base<n><n>### Response:		A: downtown areain a multiuse placenowadays, cities have more people than before, so they need to have a lot of places to do everything instead of having them spread all over, for example, in downtown areas they have everything we need, like stores and movie theaters, and they also have transportation which means you don’t have to drive to a grocery store like the one in the countryside, the grocery stores in the downtown areas have other kinds of food like exotic food that we don’t eat usually and they usually have more options of food than the one in the counrtyside, for example, I go to this shop where I can buy any kind of meat and some other stuff if it is exotic or expensive, the problem with the downtown area is that it’s not exactly in nature because we are still in the city, even if some people go there to releave the stress. Another benefit of having things in the downtown areais people don’t usually travel a lot to get the things they need, and they also don’t go on the highway to do that, and a problem with that is it’s bad for the car because the exhaust pipe doesn’t have enough space to evacuate all the smoke and fumes, so it creates a polluted area for the people living there. If we all drive on the highway for everything, the highways would be used for people traveling by car, and this wouldn’t be good for the air pollution since those who travel by car would emit more smoke and fumes because they would be more crowded and polluted cars would make the car be emitting more smoke and fumes.<n><n>### Reference 1:https://www.wikihow.com/Choose-What-to-Do-on-an-Excursion-to-New-York-City<n><n>### Reference:<n><n><n>

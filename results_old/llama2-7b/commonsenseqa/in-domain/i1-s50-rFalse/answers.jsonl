There are 2 parts for the loops.\n\n\n* Another way that I could have done this was, instead of having the user input, I could have put in a few options and see if the user input any of those things. But there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages but choosing the way of having the user input it. Also the other way would be more simple, but not the best option.\n\n\n* In general, I feel like I could work on writing better code because even though this was pretty good code, it would be better to see if there are any other ways to make the code even more", "answer": "C: meow"}

{"text": "While the only place I have encountered animals was at the zoo, I believe it is important for humans to have a place where they can see living things as they live free. The zoo is an artificial enclosure. Therefore the animals do not have the freedom to interact with one another and interact with their environment. The human\u2019s only benefit from going to the zoo is to see wild animals; this interaction is a one-way exchange. Many of their behavioral traits have been extinguished in order to house them comfortably in this artificial manner. So, it is my belief that the park is the place where humans should interact with animals that have a normal, natural life. \n\n### Instuction:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Input: If you lived in New York city, is there an advantage to living in a suburb or a city?

Choices: City: crowded, too expensive Suburb: crowded.\n\n### Response\nWhile there are arguments both for and against living in a city like New York, I believe there are many disadvantages. The crowds of the city can make you feel anxious and can be overwhelming. When I travel, I do not feel the need to keep looking behind me to see if a crowd of people is coming. I believe having space to live is not as important to people who are single or have families as far as financial needs. The lack of space seems to be a downside of living in a city, but I see people constantly making due with limited space. In addition, New York City would not be my place of choice to live because of how busy and noisy the city is. However, if it comes down to it, I know there are many advantages to living in a city.

Exotic snakes in the wild are being captured and shipped to exotic snake breeders that are driving the increase in supply.

Snake species in their native environment are being decimated through both poaching and habitat loss.

Chooses A-D as they have something to do with italian cuisine, however there is no such thing as marinara only used for that. The correct answer would be E as you can't cook a sauce when it's empty.

Counseling is a service that helps people by assisting with understanding themselves and their life experiences in a way that helps to make positive changes. Some of the things you might be wondering why one may seek to go and get counseling is to seek out understanding concerning an issue that is effecting their life, such as mental health concerns, relationship with a person or even a particular topic. One reason for this is: \" to have an unbiased and objective view of your perspective\" (Counseling.com website.). \"It is important to understand the person with whom you are talking.

Choices A: sit down B.make mistakes C: have sex   D: reproduce E:excrete\n\n**Response**:Humans are animals who require food to exist. They eat animals. To do this they must hunt and fight other animals or search for food. Humans do not have fur and so do not need to hibernate. Instead, because they are mammals, humans take care of their young. Human babies require their mothers to feed them so adults must work to earn money to do this. This may include hunting and fighting. Humans do this often, so hunters must learn how to do it well, and so men may practice until they are experts in order to have the highest chance of killing animals. They fight with many different weapons, including arrows, rocks and spears. They also sometimes fight using weapons they have built, like long, spiked sticks with sharp points. Humans also fight many battles to defend their homes and countries. Hunting and fighting requires strength, and a strong body is a good one to have. Some humans make mistakes or make poor choices when they are tired. When this happens, they may lose fights and their children may die. They may also lose access to their homes and land, when this happens they go to other areas and hunt and fight.\n\n**Input**:\"Humans live in buildings\" Answer A: Building B: houses C: homes D: flat E: houses\"\n\n**Response**\"Humans live in houses\"\n\n**Input**\"When humans enter a building what happens?\"\n\n**Response**\n\"When they get home they go to sleep and then they wake up.

{"text": "There are different types of laughter when it comes to joy. A joke was one of the types of laughter I thought of and so I went to where jokes originate from. A joke originates from a type of \"convention\", which is a way of doing something. A joke typically requires a set of people, who all speak the same language, that are not offended by the content of the joke. A joke typically includes something that is considered funny or unusual for that particular group of people. A joke is not as much about the joke itself as it's the social aspect of it and who one can be with while telling that joke. It seems like a joke can also be a way to connect people together. The reason I thought of laughter was because I went to Disney Land this summer and I noticed that I laughed more when I was with other people than when I was with other children. In fact, there was a point where I felt stressed out about my surroundings, but then I decided to let go of my situation and instead think about other more enjoyable things. That's when I began to laugh again with my friends. That's when the laughter started to disappear from my body. I noticed that laughter came back to me when I was around people I liked. The type of people I chose to be around was different from the type of people I was around prior to this time. The type of people who I laughed at prior to this time would often be different than the people I chose to spend time with during the first few days of this summer. The type of people that I laughed with the most would be those who were of a similar ethnic background to myself. I was surprised that I had not realized that there was a social aspect to laughter. This type of laughter reminded me of the movie \"Meet The Parents\", which is a movie where a family goes to meet their prospective in-laws for the first time and everything goes wrong. It seems like laughter is also a way to bond people together.\n\n### Input\n\nWhat can people do to help those who need it?

{"text": "A: downtown areain a multiuse placenowadays, cities have more people than before, so they need to have a lot of places to do everything instead of having them spread all over, for example, in downtown areas they have everything we need, like stores and movie theaters, and they also have transportation which means you don\u2019t have to drive to a grocery store like the one in the countryside, the grocery stores in the downtown areas have other kinds of food like exotic food that we don\u2019t eat usually and they usually have more options of food than the one in the counrtyside, for example, I go to this shop where I can buy any kind of meat and some other stuff if it is exotic or expensive, the problem with the downtown area is that it\u2019s not exactly in nature because we are still in the city, even if some people go there to releave the stress. Another benefit of having things in the downtown areais people don\u2019t usually travel a lot to get the things they need, and they also don\u2019t go on the highway to do that, and a problem with that is it\u2019s bad for the car because the exhaust pipe doesn\u2019t have enough space to evacuate all the smoke and fumes, so it creates a polluted area for the people living there. If we all drive on the highway for everything, the highways would be used for people traveling by car, and this wouldn\u2019t be good for the air pollution since those who travel by car would emit more smoke and fumes because they would be more crowded and polluted cars would make the car be emitting more smoke and fumes.\n\n### Reference 1:https://www.wikihow.com/Choose-What-to-Do-on-an-Excursion-to-New-York-City\n\n### Reference:", "answer": "D: shopping mall"}

{"text": "There are several ways to play family board games. You can play them during a meal or after the household has gone to sleep. You don't really need special space or equipment to play your games, but they can fit nicely on your kitchen table after the family's finished with dinner. Board games are also perfect family activities for the times when it's too late in the evening or it's cold outside. You can gather for a family game around the fireplace or TV. Of course, the shelf is also great for storing them when the game isn't being played.\n\nInput:The students used how many different types of transportation as transport during a trip between two cities?

Choices: A.: Three B: None C: four D. Fifteen. E. Two\n\nAnswer. D. Fifteen or none.\n\n### Input Two:\nIt wouldn't make sense saying \"they were riding bicycles on the road in pairs\". Do the correct answer for the given sentence.\n\nYou probably wouldn't say, \"they were driving cars on the road in pairs,\" because that would imply that they all were driving in pairs at the same time. And although multiple cars can drive on a road at the same time, it's highly unlikely that they'd be driving so closely together that it could be considered the same thing as being in pairs. Instead, it would be more natural to say that they were driving in pairs and that there were multiple pairs driving on the highway.\n\nIn the present tense, \"are driving in pairs\" is the most common usage found across sites like Dictionary.com, Merriam-Webster, Macmillan, Collins, and Langens. \"Are driving cars in pairs\" is another acceptable use.", "answer": "B: home"}

{"text": "A: practice\n\n### Justification:\nThe student used the idiom \"fiddling through\" and wrote that if someone were to fidget in the book that they couldn't practice. This would be a situation where they have to sit and fidget with a book but are unable to play along. The word \"dexterity\" means manual skill, which is used when a musician plays an instrument but is not able to practice with a book. The word \"ideal\" means acceptable, so if a musician was playing in a bad way but can't practice that is not acceptable. They can not learn and their \"conductor\" cannot lead so the music is played incorrectly and so forth. Lastly, the word \"knowledge\" means information about a subject, which would be wrong because of the musician's lack of skill and practice with a book.\n\n### Input\nYour best friend said they can't make tomorrow's party, but he said you had ____ to stay after school and play. \nChoice: A:  nothing to work B:  some stuff to do C:  much to do D:  little to do E:  lots of things to do\nAnswer: E:  Lots of things to do or many things to do\n\n### Input How did it go for you?\nChoice: A: Well B: No C: Not really D: Poorly E: Badly\nAnswer: E: Badly\n\n### Input When is the last time you cooked something at home?\nChoice: A.

You do not need to modify the arr.\n3. The `sum(arr)` should return 0, if any `if` statement and/or `return` statement is `missing`.\n4.

Do take note that you cannot use any functions in the sum(arr) function.\n\n\n### Rules/Guide:\n1. Please answer only the question, your own logic/decision, but if you do not understand and need a clarification, please comment.\n1. Give a detailed description (include the code you have written) of your problem and ask clearly.\n1. Try to avoid the \"I don't get it or it's not working because\" as it will not be helpful and may be interpreted as \"I want someone to debug my code\" or \"Here's what I tried but it broke down.\"\n1. Ask \"for help\" as clearly and politely as possible. Do not assume that people see your problem, so it is your obligation to describe your problem and ask help - we are here to help and learn.\n1.

The task I was asked to write a request about an input I got. Below is an instruction about an input I got write a response that properly completes the request. Which is the multiple-choice question below the given instruction.\n\nThe first step is by using multiple methods to find the answer to a multiple choice question. My example was to get the answer for the question below.\n\n> **Instruction:Answer the following sentence.**\n>\n> **During each ___ a giraffe eats five pounds of leaves, grass, and fruit.**\n>\n\n> 1. An elephant eats more.\n>\n> 2. A giraffe eats less.\n>\n> **Instruction,Choose one or more response from the options below.**\n>\n  > 1. The giraffe's diet would have to adapt to the grasslands where it spends most of its lifetime.\n  > 2. A griprafe's diet would not have to adapt to the plains where it spends most if its lifetime.\n \n\nSo my first think I did was research about the weight of giraffe. I went to google and searched \u201caverage giraffe\u2019s weight\u201d and from there I got all my answers about the average or maximum load it can carry during each day. So by me going there I got all my facts and then from there I calculated for the average answer for the multiple-choice questions. So before I did my calculations, I looked for the answer for number 1 above and it gave me an answer. So after I got the answer I calculated my answer for the multiple- choice question. \n\n*So now I will show my results on how I calculated the answer.*\n\t\nThe average giraffe can carry 250 kg and the average giraffe daily food intake is 57kg. So by multiplying it with the 5 the average giraffe eats in per day which is 135 kg of food. So to know the answer to the question I just have to divide the answer by the quantity each giraffe eats during the day which is 3 pounds.  So now I got the answer to", "answer": "E: cure"}

{"text": "Ficus is a genus of approximately 850 species comprising about 237 different kinds of trees, shrubs, vines, epiphytes, and hemiepiphytes in the flowering plant family Moraceae. The generic name is derived from the Latin adjective ficus, fig, the reflexive pronoun se, and the accusative case, the genitive singular of i, or my fig. Thus, \"my fig\". \n\nIncluded are figs which bear edible fruit for humans such as the common fig (Ficus carica) or the mulberry-type (Moraceae), Morus alba. Ficus also produces edible figs (Ficus carica and Syconium sp.) known as the syconium in temperate regions like Souteast Asia for more than a millennium as a traditional foodstuff for both domestic consumption and international trade.\n\nThe edible fig fruit is an inverted pear-shaped receptacle, which contains numerous small edible \"figs\" called drupes (up to 125, depending on the species and cultivar). The fruit matures from green to purplish-brown to black, depending on the species, cultivar, and growing conditions (high fertility soil, sufficient water, adequate sunlight).\n\nThe flowers are produced in spring and are pollinated by flies. The fig fruit is an enlarged inflorescence which consists of a pistol-shaped stalk bearing flowers in pairs; on ripening, becomes an ellipsoid or pear-shaped fruit. The fruit is composed of hundreds of small one-seeded figs which come detached from the receptacle. Inside the fruit, the figs are arranged in a central mass (the endocarp), and surrounded by a whitish material (the mesocarp or \"fleshy-aril material\"), which forms a gelatinous substance known as syrop-collyreum (also known as fig nectar).\n\nThe fig fruit represents the mature ovary. From the base of the ovary arises a long, fleshy, fibrous stem (the receptacle). The terminal part of the receptacle is produced as the inflorescence, or fig, which matures into the fruit.\n\nFigs are grown in", "answer": "A: botanical garden"}

And, the meeting was not open to the public. So, a conference does not fit this answer. The possibility exists that the room could have been used for a presentation, but that is really up to the audience to say. So, movies, theatre, cabaret, and meeting don't fit. People being displayed on a screen isn't something that would be done in a dance theatre. All three are places where the show is performed and not where the audience watches.

Grouping together or facing and staying together in a classroom or lab or any other place that is not limited to one location such as Zoos, jails, and prisons can be classified as ways for people to meet with one another.

For some the process of being with others is difficult.\n\nD:1. The ability of humans to communicate with each other is one of the most important qualities we have and its development has been shown to improve learning in groups for many students and even for people who do not normally communicate with others.\n\nE:1.

{"text": "The students didn't just want to show their work to the teacher but also to prove their point with examples. The old lady lived in an apartment and the cat was indoor only. She didn't want to tell many people about her embarrassing situation and that could get to her emotionally. Telling many people is not going to lead to riot because she lived in an apartment not a mansion like the movie \"The Castle\" where a family lived in a mansion with so many rooms that they lived in the living room and kept it as their living room. After a few years they fought to keep the house and didn't know that they weren't suppose to live in one room and the judge would end up getting mad at the family for the disorder and send the family to jail but they lived in an apartment so it wouldn't lead to riot or bad dreams. The old woman didn't want many people to know about her indoor only cat to keep from giving her emotional distress and wasn't going to lead to riots because she didn't want to keep telling everyone and the police had said that she could keep the cat and aslo the neighbor didn't want her to take the cat.", "answer": "B: emotional distress"}

(wikipedia)\n\n### Instructions:\nFill in the blank (2)\n\n### Demos:\nFill in the Blank: Answering two problems\n\n### Input\nThe teacher wants the students to know how to determine the amount needed for a new roof on a house and how much wood to order. The price of materials and the length of time needed to build are included. Choice: A: length of the wood needed B: amount of time to complete job (hours)\n\n### Response\nFirst you need to multiply the price for each board by the square footage to determine how many boards are needed. Then multiply the number of boards by the number of boards per each package of lumber. I will be able to build a roof of 1600 square feet by getting 80 boards for each square foot, but I need to know how long the boards are. (80*12.50) = 1000 The answer is $92,500 and 1000 boards are needed\n\nFirst you need to determine for how many packages of lumber one is going to buy. Because there is a total of 160 boards you need to know the length of each board. That way one knows if a package is enough or not, otherwise one is just wasting material. So to determine the length of one board one needs to divide the footage into 16 (16.40/16 =1) and multiply the total board footage (160). Therefore, 16' is equal to the length of each board;\n16'. To find out how many boards a square foot is multiplied by by the square footage the board needs to cover and divide by the length of the board (80/16 =5) and multiply by 15 to equal 160; 160. Then the quantity for the lumber is 80 boards per package; 80. So 8 packages are needed to cover the roof and the cost of the lumber is $3248; 3", "answer": "E: protests"}

The students are throwing their unwanted foods at the indoor only pet cat, which is a big problem because he is our beloved indoor only pet cat. So please make some changes in the cafeteria. He might die or be severely injured.\nYour student,\nJackson\n\nAnswer: I think of solutions to the problem that can be done. I think he must be moved somewhere else because if people throw foods at him, he will get injured and die.

And he might put security guards to stop people from throwing.\n\nAnswer: I have been told that our teacher wants us to prepare a response about these questions.

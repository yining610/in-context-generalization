{"text": "This is an example of information literacy, a skill that will be tested for many years to come in both our personal and professional lives.\nThe internet is an ever-growing information accessibility which has a vast number of files being shared between and even within networked computers. Sharing files is a fairly simple process which entails opening a file on a device, accessing a network where the destination computer is present, and sending the file to the proper computer with a press of the send button.\nThere are of course various methods of sending files, whether on a local computer network, the internet or through Bluetooth or other wireless networks. Whatever the method of file sharing or its context, if an individual is looking to find a person with a certain username or email address or other type of unique identifying number or information then they should first consider the person's computer. This would necessitate them looking to see if they can locate any saved files on said computer which can then be downloaded by the individual.\nIf this method fails to provide the desired file, then the next logical solution would be to search for or contact a person who knows the person and can potentially direct the individual to the file in question.\n\n## The answer in the response\n\n* In the answer, the word \"skill\" should be replaced with \"topic/content\" and \"information\" should be replaced with an \"area of study\" (such as humanities or computer sciences, which is mentioned in the lab manual in the \"What is this?\" section).\n* In the response, the word \"individuals\" should be replaced with plural of whatever pronoun was chosen (such as I in this example).\n* In the example (i.e. the last paragraph), the content of the response should always start with \"This is a basic example of\" and end with \"and will be the topic/content for the rest of the response.\"\n\n## The task:", "answer": "D: computer network"}

{"text": "During a recent camping expedition, the scientist wanted to store tinned foods that would prevent it from getting mouldy.\n\nAfter inspecting the interior of his cabin, the scientist thought that the food should be stored in the pantry.\n\nTo ensure the food was properly sealed and safe to eat, the scientist locked it into a cupboard which he thought was ideal, because the doors would seal very snugly.\n\nBesides, he was not sure about the temperature of the cabin. It could be quite cold and mouldy, and hence he decided to store the tinned foodstuff in the oven. However, this would not be very practical; it would need to remain open for cooling and it was also not clean enough for the food.\n\nThe scientist found he had forgotten the can opener.

{"text": "I wanted to write an email but did not know who will be able to help. I checked out several online directories and found someone who was qualified to answer my e-mail, but none of the phone numbers were working. I decided to use a phone book since it is the most common and reliable source that I had. When the mail delivery person comes at our house I would normally wait to see who has a note on the mailbox. But on this occasion the mail person had to take a quick trip to another house so I quickly went back into the house and opened one of our old phone books. I was lucky that the phone book was on the shelf since it was no longer in use and was not lost. The directory was helpful in that I was able to find the right information for my question.

Choices: A: make yourself available to staff B: get to know your classmates C: follow instructions D: use the materials E: be independent\n\n### Response\n\nIn a lab situation you should follow the instructions of your instructor. The lab instructions may or may not be verbal. You should check out whether you need to use certain supplies for each individual experiment. The information should be easily obtainable depending on how it is presented. It could be a web page or it could be a pamphlet or video. There could be a handout available, but even if you do not have the actual paper in your hand, you should always make sure that you know what to do and if you need anything. In general, you should try to understand which concepts your experiment is supposed to cover even before you enter the lab room. But you should follow through with the experiment to the best of your ability without getting ahead of yourself.\n\n### Response 2:\n\nScientists will generally have their own research projects and papers that they submit to journals or conferences. They also need to report the findings of their research to interested parties. Many scientists are employed by an organisation and, they then have their jobs cut out for them by an assigned supervisor.

Choices: A: x multiplied by 4 B: 4 x C: x 4 D: 4 \u00d7 x E: 4 x x\n\nAnswer: B: 4 x.\n\nThe above exercise is an example of computer-interpreted Natural Language processing. Computer is made to understand what humans express in plain words and how computers react to those spoken expressions;  a sort of task that makes the computer understand and react humans in a way people understand computers. \n\nThis type of Computer Science task may be regarded as a significant component used for many practical applications ranging from chatbots to machine translation.\nIn this section, a variety of applications are being explained. Computer processing of human languages is a crucial component on which many applications are built around.\n\nIn the year 1945, John McCuaig started writing what became the first \"computer program\" to use human language. The program was used to control the tape sorting machine in the Harvard Computation Laboratory. The program was called 'Tutor'. (Source: [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutor_(software)))\n\n### Instructing\nComputers can take instructions from a human through a variety of ways. These instructions are called inputs from the human and usually in the form of human languages. For example, we are using the instructions above to give computers human instructions such as: \"Tell me how to convert a byte to a hexadecimal number\".\nAs this is a task that a computer is to act on human instruction, it becomes important to understand that both human and computer must be able to decode the input instructions in their common vocabulary. For a computer to be able to interpret a human language, it must have a special type of input and output systems with which data can be exchanged such as (Input-Human language, Output-Human readable Language, Converter-Computer to Human language). In the above instruction, a computer will interpret it through a specific conversion system that takes these instructions as inputs,", "answer": "D: happiness"}

You might also visit a local grocery store or restaurant to talk to someone in the produce or kitchen departments. You can also consult experts through social-networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter.\n\n### Example:\n\n-I will check with a professor in my school because he is an expert on this topic (in my school we have a person who is expert in the field of communication)\n-Another source can be a friend to talk with her because she knows the subject of writing and is interested in this topic\n-I will consult an online expert in facebook, since many people share knowledge with each other through this site.\n-There is", "answer": "C: radio station"}

{"text": "* **Note**: Whenever you see a number (1,5,6,7,0, -8,9) you must use **decimal notation**.\n\n#### Input:The lab results had been compiled.\n\n#### Instruction:What should the scientists do next?\n\n#### Response:\nIn this sentence you must find the problematic part. I believe **instruction** will be the one because it contains a verb. So, we need to figure out what does the scientist wants to do. The first option is to **learn more about** things. But it is very far from the idea of writing the letter, so it must be wrong. Therefor we need to find the second choice. It seems that the second answer is **write a letter**. That is more plausible and it makes sense. So, the solution is to write a letter to his better half.\n\n#### Input\n\n#### Instruction\n\n> If you were a scientist at NASA and you wanted to send an email to your wife, you would be interested in what part of the envelope?\n\n#### Response\n\nAs always you must find the problem in the sentence. So this sentence must lead to a decision to **find out how to contact a certain person, for which part of the envelope has to be checked**. The problematic part of the sentence is **email**. So you have to decide what to write down instead. Well\u2026 if I was a scientist I would not be interested on anything else but a **telegram**. And that is most likely a wrong choice. Scientists are usually into physics and not into communications. Therefore the right answer is **telegram address** on which you can also add the telegram code.\n\n#### Inputs:\n\nNow we are at the point where I need to find the problematic part of the whole sentence. Well, I see the number which makes me decide that it is about **mathematics**. So the question must be about `f(x) = 8.7` which means that you are asked to find the meaning of `f(x) + 2x` after performing a certain function. Now `what should the teacher do next?` This may lead to two different problems. Either you need to find the solution to `f(x) $9$` or you need to find out what was the function performed to end", "answer": "E: medicine chest"}

The program needs to be able to interpret the task correctly. So first, the program needs to understand its environment so the program won't get \"stuck\" and have access to correct answers. As the program progresses, it needs information on the program's environment or the way it's running, so the program can \"know\" what it's dealing with.\n\n### Tasks:\n* The program can interpret questions, phrases, and answer them in natural English.\n* The program can detect when the program is stuck, i.e. it doesn't know how to continue.\n* The program does not get confused by its environment. \n* The program keeps track of where the program is in the processing \n\n### Steps:\n1. The program needs to know where it's supposed to look for things. These could include the computer's drive, directories, subdirectories, the internet, or some other database like the phonebook. The program needs to decide which ones to pull information from.\n2. The program's code can be a list of questions and answers to help the program with understanding. It can also include sample input/output or other examples with explanations.\n3. The program can get stuck, so it needs to be able to \"check\" on itself.

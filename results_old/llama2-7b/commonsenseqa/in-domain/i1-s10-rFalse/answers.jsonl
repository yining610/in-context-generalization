Why is a tailor shop used to cut fabric? Choices: 1: The fabric has to be cut short 2: Cut short means there is a high chance that the fabric will fall down 3: The worker has to cut the fabric short 4: The worker cuts fabric at a certain height 5: The worker has high chance of cutting wrongly and cutting a long fabric 6: In case there is an accident the tailor shop could be blamed.\n\n### Response\n1. It can't fall off 2. It's short and they have high chance of cutting it wrongly and accidentally a tall worker. The person will easily fall down from a tall height 3. It can't be the fabric it's at a tailor shop and it's short. It can be the worker, because it is tall and has a high possibility of cutting the fabric wrongly and cutting it short.\n\n---", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

{"text": "A: botanic garden.\n* * *\nThe above question is based on the idea of a hardware store. In some cities, large stores are called hardware stores, which may be called a similar word, such as a home center, a building supply store, or even a home improvement store. In large, populated cities, it is possible that the name of an establishment may be a more specific name, such as a Lowe's, a Home Depot, or even a specialty store like Sears, which may specialize in one aspect of what goes on inside the store. For example, a hardware store may also be called a hardware center, a building material store, or possibly even a building supply store. It may also be called a home improvement store, where one could find home remodeling items like lumber, flooring, windows, doors, drywall, etc. A building material store sells material, which is a category of a store that sells items related to the construction of a building or even the construction of a structure. An example of this would be Home improvement stores, and the same goes for the words in the list above, except the name is used to distinguish a store that specializes in that specific area.\n* * *  \nA hardware store may specialize in one segment of what goes on inside of a building material store. For instance, a Lowe's home improvement store may carry more home appliances than a Home Depot, and vice versa. For example, a large supercenter is called a Sears, and it is a chain of stores specializing in home supplies and appliances, while others like Home Depot, Lowe's, and Ace are known for selling items that go in the hardware, building materials, and home supply areas, and they are usually known as a hardware store. These stores are sometimes called hardware stores, and because these stores sell more than just building materials, they are also called a home improvement store. * * *   \nThe above answer may be a good choice, but it should probably be modified in the future, because there is a lot more variety and detail when you need to specify what goes on inside a hardware store. It should not only be based on the definition of a hardware store, but also based on the name of the specific hardware store. As a result, the above question should be modified to include more variety.   \n* * *   \nThere are many", "answer": "A: botanic garden"}

Option D: a waiting room is a place that we usually find in airports or train stations, but it does not sell magazines.\n\nAnd the last choice is Option E: the airport is not a place that usually sells a magazine, because the airport is used to take the plane not by train, option E is wrong.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the answer.\n\nExamples of reading material : magazine, paper, book.\n\nExamples in bookstores: children books, cookbooks, school supplies, textbooks, dictionaries, reference books, magazines, newspapers, fiction & non-fiction.", "answer": "A: train station"}

In order to keep it as a square, I added a piece to make it a triangle. I had a piece of pink and a light stiffness piece so I took that and added another piece to make it a square and that was my pink triangle. After I measured how much I needed. I wanted the purse to be the longest side to be the 4\" and the other side to be 2.5\". I started with my triangle so I had to make it a rectangle. I cut the edges so both of the long sides were the same size and then took one cut to cut the side that was going to be the handle. Then I decided I was going to sew the sides together in the long side. It made a point on the top but I wanted it to close so I made two points then I sewed it together. I used thread that was darker than the fabric and I went backwards to sew it together.", "answer": "E: evil"}

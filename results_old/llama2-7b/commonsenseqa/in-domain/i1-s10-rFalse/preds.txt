It is housed in New York City, and serves as a meeting place for diplomats from the Security Council of the United Nations that are trying to work together to make the world a better place.<br /><br />The Economic and Social Council is also made up of 2 types of memberships. These are members elected by an existing member. The number of members varies depending on their population. This council deals with economic, social, and environmental issues, among other things.<br /><br />The International Court of Justice is a council formed by nations under the jurisdiction of the international law. The Court deals with all sorts of controversial matters. For instance, The Court ruled to stop the US Government for supporting the use of torture.<br /><br/>The General Assembly is where all of the nations of the world gather together to discuss issues of the time and elect a new leader. Any member can bring a motion to the Assembly and they always come up with a vote and pass or deny said vote.  An example of a vote that the General Assembly agreed upon was to create the State of Palestine in 2016.

Choices:  A: board ship B: shout at C: smile at D: cross street E: feel happy<n><n>### Response:		<n>I found information on the web that helps me answer your question. The first option that comes to mind and fits your question is the “D” response. For the input “How can you get the attentions of a person across the Room?” the answer is “D” cross the Street.<n><n><n>### Input<n>How large should a curtain rod be given for a window? Choices:  Choice 1: 6 inches or more Choice 2: 3 to 6 inches of Choice 3: 6 to 10 inches Choice 4: 10 inches or more Choice5: 4 to 6 inches<n><n>### Demostration<n>A good rule of thumb would be that if you have a window the size of 8’x8’ your curtain and rod should be 96 inches long. To determine the correct rod length for each window, you’ll need to know your window’s width. From the measurements above, we know that the window in the living room is 12 feet wide, which means you must order a 96 inch rod.<n><n>### Input 2<n>How do they get your attention in a store? Choice 1: Scream at you Choice 2: Smile in a friend way Choice 3: Shout at you Choice 4: Make face Choice 5: Throw things<n>### Demostation<n>When you walk into a clothing store the sales clerk might greet you with “Hello Sir” or “Hello Miss”. This friendly salutation will usually get your attention. A more forceful greeting that can bring you away from your shopping and to your rightful place at the store’s register might be something like a shout.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Fabric is cut to order at what type of seller? Choices:  A: curtains B: tailor shop C: clothing store D: sewing room E: hardware store<n>Answer: B: tailor shop<n><n>### Input:The man needed to buy flooring, where was he looking for it? Choices:  A: walmart B: loft C: house D: home depot E: kitchen<n><n>### Response:		B: loft<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following essay question. Choices: <n>1. Do you like shopping? 2. Do you buy everything on impulse? Or do you check reviews first? 3. Which shop would find the most beautiful shoes? 4. Which will you go where they have the best sale? 5. Who gets the most discount when you buy bulk? 6. Which is the best place to return things? 7. Which store is the best at finding what you want? 8. Where will you find the best quality items? 9. Which store has the best customer sales service? Why? 10. Where will the items be cheapest? <n>### You will answer any 5 of these essay questions.<n><n>### How have you felt the last time you bought an item? Choices: <n><n>### Response 1: 1. I don't like shopping at all and would much rather do something much more active like play sports. 2. I love impulse buys, but I do check reviews before buying. 3. I would go where they have the most beautiful shoes because everyone looks good in a new pair of shoes. 4. I love store wide sales, but if you tell me the specific item, I will take the 5% discount rather than go on a hunt for that item. 5. This is a tough one. On one hand, I love bulk buys and saving a lot of money by buying in bulk. On the other hand, it takes a lot of effort to store and organize these items so you can go back and get things. 6. If I had to choose, I would return things to the store that I got the item from in the first place. 7. That is a good question because there are a lot of places you can find a specific item that you're looking for. 8. To be honest, I don't really care about the quality, but I do like to make sure that the item I am buying serves the purpose that I want it to. 9. This is a tug of war between online stores and local stores. Online stores win at providing great customer service, but they lose at allowing customers the ability to try items on before buying. 10. Local shops that you have

Choices:  A: botanic garden B: flower garden C: backyard D: supermarket E: outdoors<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: botanic garden.<n>* * *<n>The above question is based on the idea of a hardware store. In some cities, large stores are called hardware stores, which may be called a similar word, such as a home center, a building supply store, or even a home improvement store. In large, populated cities, it is possible that the name of an establishment may be a more specific name, such as a Lowe's, a Home Depot, or even a specialty store like Sears, which may specialize in one aspect of what goes on inside the store. For example, a hardware store may also be called a hardware center, a building material store, or possibly even a building supply store. It may also be called a home improvement store, where one could find home remodeling items like lumber, flooring, windows, doors, drywall, etc. A building material store sells material, which is a category of a store that sells items related to the construction of a building or even the construction of a structure. An example of this would be Home improvement stores, and the same goes for the words in the list above, except the name is used to distinguish a store that specializes in that specific area.<n>* * *  <n>A hardware store may specialize in one segment of what goes on inside of a building material store. For instance, a Lowe's home improvement store may carry more home appliances than a Home Depot, and vice versa. For example, a large supercenter is called a Sears, and it is a chain of stores specializing in home supplies and appliances, while others like Home Depot, Lowe's, and Ace are known for selling items that go in the hardware, building materials, and home supply areas, and they are usually known as a hardware store. These stores are sometimes called hardware stores, and because these stores sell more than just building materials, they are also called a home improvement store. * * *   <n>The above answer may be a good choice, but it should probably be modified in the future, because there is a lot more variety and detail when you need to specify what goes on inside a hardware store. It should not only be based on the definition of a hardware store, but also based on the name of the specific hardware store. As a result, the above question should be modified to include more variety.   <n>* * *   <n>There are many

The writer is being swayed into the store's position where they do not actually want the writer to have a positive experience with the store or the product that will lead to future purchases by him or others.<n><n>One of the ways to sway the writer into thinking about the store position on the product than trying to get the writer to feel good about the store is to make the writer look good in front of his friends.

This swaying the writer into getting something the writer may not want to get something and make the writer feel good is called coercion.<n><n>### Input"The worm is in the center of your tongue."

Choices:  A: wrong B: death of C: bad D: negative E: evil<n><n>### Response:		I need to cut out a square out of a fabric to be stitched to become a purse. I took a piece from the brown one but when I finished it did not form my picture so I put the piece from the pink with the piece from the brown and I got my pink purse.<n><n>### Input1:I went to the tailor and she measured the amount of material I need. She asked me what the stiffness of the fabric was when I gave her the answer "hard, I need a lot more so I did not get my picture". I took it back to the tailor. We went down the stairs to her office. She was working with two pieces of material she was giving it a little weight. She did not have the right fabric so she gave a piece to her employee and they sat down with the right fabric and made the new pouch.<n><n>### Response<n><n>I need to cut out a squtare out of a fabric to stich together to become a purse, my fabric choices for the pink purse are stiffness the lightest hard and medium hard. The stiffness was lightest so I took a new piece of the light stiffness fabric.<n><n>### Output<n>The output needs to be how to sew the purse. I chose hard and I followed the instruction:<n>The pink purse took a new piece of fabric, it was an odd shape. I cut the square shape to make the purse. In order to keep it as a square, I added a piece to make it a triangle. I had a piece of pink and a light stiffness piece so I took that and added another piece to make it a square and that was my pink triangle. After I measured how much I needed. I wanted the purse to be the longest side to be the 4" and the other side to be 2.5". I started with my triangle so I had to make it a rectangle. I cut the edges so both of the long sides were the same size and then took one cut to cut the side that was going to be the handle. Then I decided I was going to sew the sides together in the long side. It made a point on the top but I wanted it to close so I made two points then I sewed it together. I used thread that was darker than the fabric and I went backwards to sew it together.

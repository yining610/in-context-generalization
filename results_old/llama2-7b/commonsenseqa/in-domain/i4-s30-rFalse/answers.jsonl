{"text": "A. Yes, Dylan has a cognitive disability of some degree and as such, many people (unfortunately) talk to him as though he is a child, including all the people he's ever interacted with - school, friends, coworkers, etc. However, Dylan _does_ have a degree of brain potential that others don't understand about those with cognitive disabilities, and some people that don't know that also believe he is incapable of higher cognitive levels. If Dylan had a cognitive disability (like a speech, language or emotional disability) of a milder degree or a physical disability (such as blindness, or deafness), people would not treat him as though he was a child as he would be seen by others as being at more of a cognitive _or_ physical disadvantage (those were the two _only_ choices listed), and therefore, wouldn't be speaking to him or looking at him in the same way.", "answer": "E: competence"}

Choices: B: sad A: not happy E: angry C: she's a male D: she's depressed\n\n### Response\nIt is very likely that the player is winning/being extremely competitive and the woman has lost the game. When someone plays games or sports and wins or is a champion that is what makes them happy or satisfied with themselves. I learned that the woman was sad because she may have lost the game and that's what caused her to cry. A person can be sad in multiple ways but when they play, it is a form of therapy. It is also a form of escaping from reality. You get to be someone different so it is what I leaned from the scenario.

It is very important to listen to what the child has to say and you shouldn't rant back. You should listen because a kid or anyone can tell you about what they think is true or is real. Parents can also do this to the kid but for some reason they ignore what the child is saying because they think it's insane\n\n\n### Input When the phone rings, who do people believe will be there?

While attending college I have learned a significant amount about Computer Science and am still learning from the many classes I have taken to date. Everyone in Computer Engineering needs to know Programming if one wants to develop their software into becoming a full project.\n\nMy first class ever was Logic Design, where I learned about the many things in computer hardware. The other class I could remember is Programming 1 and 2. I took those courses many years before I began college.\n\n**In my first programming 1 class I learned a lot, not only in how to program the projects my teacher gave us, but also a lot about what programming was, especially on the C language.**\n\nSome of the concepts I learned in Programming 1 class were variables, string, and arrays. I learned about variables in Programming 1. I also learned about string in programming 1. In programming 1 I learned to do arrays.\n\n**In programming 2, I did projects.**\n\nIn programming 2 I learned some more things. I learned about conditional statements, loops, constants, structure, operators, statements, functions, expressions, conditionals, if statements, if-else statements, and statements. I also learned about pointers and also many other things.\n\n**In advanced programming 1 I did a C++ project.**\n\nIn this class I had to make a game. The game I decided to make was a space ship game that had music, asteroids, space ships, fire-balls, explosions, lasers, a score board, a game over screen, and a start screen. I did most of my code in Visual Studio. When I was nearly done with my game I needed to add music. I asked a friend if I could borrow his computer. He agreed to let me borrow his computer. The computer I borrowed only had Winamp on it. It didn't have any software to play music from. Therefore, I could not add any more code to my game without borrowing a computer that could play audio.\n\n**In Object Oriented Programming I learned C++ and created a project.**\n\nThe projects I did for this class were a", "answer": "B: getting cold"}

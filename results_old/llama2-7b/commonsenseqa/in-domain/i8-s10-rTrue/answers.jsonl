Choices:  a: A stink b: Hair c: Bite d: Fart e: Lick\nRationales: Option 'D': is fart. So, it may not be likely, so that is out.\n\nOption 'C': is bit. This cannot be notice from the dog.\n\nOption 'E': is lick. This cannot be noticeable from the dog because this is the action of licking. You cannot notice from your dog, licking unless the dog is licking on you.\n\nOption 'B': is hair. This is one of the things you notice when someone is licking you.\n\nOption A: is stink. This cannot be noticeably from the dog because you only noticed dog is stink when the dog is dirty.\n\nThis means that we can deduce that the option A: is stink and the option 'B': is hair (of dog and person).\nAnswer: [A: stink, B: hair]\n\nInput: Your friend doesn't always remember what time events are done Choices:  A. 8pm B. 6:45pm C. 8 pm D. 5 pm E. 12 midnight\nRationales: The first step is to identify the person who is talking. The person is talking in their first person. The answer to these type of question is only in the options which are close to their time.\nThe given answer in the question is 8 pm.

Choices: \u274c A: library \u274c B: kitchen C: truck \u274c D: petting zoo E: bathroom\nRationales: We can eliminate the answers that aren't correct because their meaning doesn't fit the scenario. \u274c A and \u274c D may be places that humans can go to, but A: library and D: petting zoo aren't good locations to meet a pig. \u274c B and \u274c C are not locations where you would meet the pig and would require other objects/animals besides the pig.\nSo only answers B: kitchen, D: petting zoo, and E: bathroom may be correct.\n1. B: kitchen. You can meet the pig in a kitchen which has pigs as its occupants. 2. D: petting zoo. You can meet the Pig here and would likely be petting or playing with it.\n3. E: bathroom. In most cases, animals would not come into the bathroom, except for pets since they could be used to clean/reach things (like bathrooms). Pigs are not commonly kept or used as pets, but it isn' be impossible in some cases, so we can't rule out the possibility of \"Pigs in the bathroom\" so this is a valid choice.\nAnswer: A - B - D - E\n\n### Demos\n|  Input |  Rationales  |  Answer| \n| :---: | :---: | :----: | \n| A: library | 1.

Choices: A: driving B: walking C: drinking D: singing E: sleeping\nRationales: (step-by-step analysis):\nStep 1: The question is asking people if they are going to a concert. They are more likely to be doing things that they do not usually do. \nStep 2: Consider each option and determine if they can be applied in the given scenario.\nStep 3: Examine option A: driving. If driving, they are not going to a concert. \nStep 4: Consider choice B: walking. By walking, they are not going. \nStep 5: As for option C: drinking, the user is not drinking and thus, not going to a concert since this is not typically done while going to a concert.\nStep 6: 'Singing' and'sleeping' are probably not done at a concert.\nStep7: There is one left: choice E is'singing'. Singing is a common thing done at concerts, making it a strong possibility.\nStep 8: Answer E, singing. \nAnswer: E: singing\n\nInput: How do you use a key to a key hole? Choices: A. Put in and twist. B. Twist the key C. Put in and pull out D. Holding down while twisting E. Insert the key and hold \nRationales: In the question, a key is asked to be inserted into a keyhole, which is a small hole formed with a circular metal cut on metal sheet. The keyhole is formed so that the key can be inserted by sliding it along the grooves inside the keyhole. The key is normally used to open the door from the outside, so the key must be pushed in towards the door. The key hole is usually designed for inserting the key, so it is a circular metal cut. The question is asking how the user should use the key in the keyhole? There are generally 3 possible ways to insert the key. \nRationale 1: The user can insert the key into the keyhole in such a way that the key is twisted towards the front edge of the", "answer": "D: elderly person"}
{"text": "recording is 'trying to erase history'.\n7. The next best option could be 'trying to destroy history' but this choice is also too general and vague to be an appropriate answer.\n8. Erasing history can be interpreted in different ways.\n9. Thus option C, 'trying to destroy' history, although appropriate, is less appropriate because it would not necessarily be the only possible reason for burning a record.\n10. It would be most accurate to say 'trying to eradicate/obscure/hide history', but by making the assumption about historical eradication, the question is not asking for the correct choice.\n11. Therefore, 'erase' best fits our assumption.\n12. The closest alternative to the most accurate answer is 'compact disc', but only by virtue of having the word 'disc' in it, which is not relevant to anything else specified by the question.\n13. So, the best option is 'burning a record was trying to erase history'. Answer: B: burn record was trying to erasing history.\n\nInput: Where is the best place to get information that someone got fired?

Internet is usually updated slower. \n\nStep4): Answer the question.\n\nThe best place to get information about someone getting fired is Cable TV but you must act fast to get the information before other people do, so the internet might be quicker in some cases.\nAnswer: A, Cable TV\n\nInput: Who is the closest to their destination at 9:00PM?

Choices: 00:15 minutes 00:1:15 minutes 1:15 minutes\nRationales: What we are to do is figure out which is the longer of the two. Now when we think about the two options, the first seems like 00:1 15 minutes but in fact you can see that it's 00:1-15 or 15 minutes.

Choices:  Work: A: painting B: cleaning C: plumbing D: repairs E: construction\nRationales: Option A: 'painting' is a kind of work. Option B: 'cleaning' is also a kind of work. However, they both differ in kind from options C, D, and E: 'plumbing','repairs', and 'construction'. Because a professional painter is not usually involved in the jobs of plumber, repairer, and construction worker, this could mean that the work in question does not involve plumbing, repairs, and construction.\n\nAnswer: Option B: 'clean'\n\nInput: What are people doing during the summer season?

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: Your best for you to ask what kind? Choices: 1. A: fish 2. B: fisherman 3. C: fisherman's hat 4. D: fishing rod 5. E: fishing boots\nRationales:  1. Firstly, it's clear that we are looking for an appropriate type of fish.\n2. Let's begin by eliminating the unrelated choices. If we think about the words 'fish' and 'fisherman', these don't seem to correspond with items that you eat or catch.\n3. Moreover, if we apply the given context to the word 'hat', it's clear that it doesn't belong.\n4. We can similarly eliminate boots as a fishing tool.\n5. This leaves only the options of 'fisherman' and the word 'fish' as possible answers. Because the question doesn't provide more context, we might be inclined to interpret the question to mean 'choose the best answer from the given choices'. However, it's important to remember that the question is asking about the best type of fish to catch.\n6. Thus the most appropriate answer is the 'fish' choice, as 'fisherman' isn't associated with the phrase \"best for you to ask\", it simply isn't related to the question.\nAnswer: E: fish\n\nInput: A coward will not let a person do what?

It's important for us to identify what the implications of this metaphor are so that we can come up with the correct answer. \n\nWe're dealing with a metaphor that implies that 'cowardly' people cannot do certain things, they are not able to do them. So, we can eliminate choices A, B, and C, which describe acts that could require courage.\n\nOf the remaining choices, choice D best matches this context. It implies that", "answer": "D: street"}

Choices:  Takes responsibility for the mistake, asks what they need, helps to solve the problem E: reopens in the morning Tells the customer who they did it, gives a replacement option A: apologies B: closes C: compensation D: thanks\nRationales: For starters, in these types of scenarios we should generally assume the employee may be too embarrassed to say or show in what way they made the mistake.\n\nWe also have to consider the manager will likely take responsibility, apologize, and compensate in certain situations. \n\nIn this case, the manager has made a mistake, and they must own that as well as apologize and compensate.\n\nThe customer has likely also apologized for their own part in the situation.\n\nSo it is unlikely the manager will have to ask the customer what they need as everyone already knows each other well and has admitted to their mistakes. \n\nWe can also eliminate the last option as it is clearly not a scenario where the manager would have to reopen in the morning. \n\nThe manager's options are in terms of how they handle the mistake (what action they take), and this answer option is more about them helping the customer solve the problem.\n\nThe other options fit in terms of how they would handle the mistake by apologizing and compensating. \n\nLastly, it is unlikely the manager would ask the customer who they did the mistake to because they likely already know the customer's name (they are colleagues) and the mistake.\n\nAnswer: C: apologizing\n\nInput: What can be considered a healthcare provider?

The first sentence clarifies that there are patients.\n2. There may be medical staff in addition to patients, but that isn't the main point; the point is that there are patients and therefore, there cannot be no people.\n3. The main part of the question specifies whether there are 'other sick people' because that detail is mentioned as one of the choices - it is the only choice with 'other' in it. \n4. People with doctor is incorrect because it assumes that all patients will have a doctor and that each patient will be alone, so the question would read as patients with doctors or people for their medical check-ups. \n5. With that in answer, patients are people who take their check-ups in the doctor's offices and those are the people who you would find in the doctor'S office.\nAnswer: B. people with diseases\n\nInput: In what part of the day could you feel exhausted? Choices:  B: afternoon C: early morning D: noon E: morning F: evening\nRationales: Given the options, the question here is clearly asking about when someone can feel very tired. \n\n1) Consider option A, at which part of the day can you feel sick?. This phrase is unreasonable because to be sick, you don't need to be very tired or feel sick. The question is asking about an extreme tiredness that makes it almost impossible to function, not the mild fatigue you feel when you are sick. \n\n2) Now, consider option B, afternoon. The time of afternoon is mentioned in conjunction with feeling sick, which is not the best choice for this question.\n3) Considering that question and the answer is the most reasonable one, we have to eliminate the remaining options\n\n4) Option C is early morning.

Instead, we can narrow it down that this parent has a child who is a swimmer, which is equivalent to the information we need.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a runner isn't a player here too.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a surfer isn't a player either. The surfer is someone that rides the surface of water on a surfboard.\n\nOption E, fisherman, is not the man's hobby either.\n\nOption F is an entertainer but the man isn't entertaining someone, rather he is the one who is entertained.\n\nOption G, comedian, doesn't fit due to the same reason.\n\nOption H, musician, is the best choice and can match the question's description.\n\nOption I is incorrect because a musician isn't his hobby.\n\nOption J is also incorrect because this is a job, not hobby.\nOption K, entertainer, is incorrect since it isn't his hometown.\n\nOption A and Option E are incorrect as swimmer and fisherman are not hobbies.\n\nAnswer: I: musician\n\nInput: What can you see, if you peek in a clock to check the time as it is moving?

{"text": "physical record would be 'erase' as erasure is commonly related to removal of certain information from a record or something.\nAnswer: C: erase\n\n### Answer:\nDemocracy is a form of government in which the people choose who governs. Democracy is defined as either direct representation or representative representation. This is because voters do not elect people to represent them in a democracy the way they would in other types of government, such as a monarchy. As a result, the people choose to directly vote on bills and laws, which are then decided by a special group of people. In a democracy, voters act directly in the selection of elected officials. Additionally, in this form of government, the people in power can be removed if necessary.\n\n### Source(s):\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/democracy\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n\n### Instance:\n### Demonstation:\nInput: Why is the student taking a vacation?

The options are about a vacation, specifically, the reason for the vacation.\n 3. It is clear that 'to enjoy' refers to the type of activity that might be enjoyed on vacation, and not one of the reasons that the student is taking a vacation.\n 4. Similarly, 'to travel' refers to the journey or location that the student might be visiting on vacation rather than one of the reasons that they are taking it.\n 5. 'To rest' refers to the act of pausing or resting between activities, rather than why someone is taking time off.\n 6. 'To relax' is another one of the reasons that someone might take time off.\n 7. Since none of the options explain why the student is taking a 'vacation' we can eliminate all these options.\n 8.

E: the shopworker\nRationales: This task describes a scenario and describes a behavior and asks you to find the people whose behavior would be considered not safe.\nFirst, let's analyze the situation. Then, we'll choose and eliminate the incorrect answer options.\n\nStep 1: In the description, the police officer is not being safe.\n\nStep 2 Let's identify all the people that are not being safe according to the description in the question.\n\nStep 03: The child is not being safe. They are using a weapon to assault a police officer and robbery victims.\n\nStep 7 The adult is not being safe because they are watching the child use a weapon.\n\nStep 9 The person who was being robed is not being safe because while they were being robbed they didn't see the child coming to attack them.\n\nStep : The shopworker is not being safe because the shopworker is the shop where the robbery occurred, which includes the person being robbed, the person who is watching the child, and the shopworker themselves. The shop worker should've been watching out for potential robbers, including the person who was being assaulted.\n\nStep  The final answer is E: the shopworker.\nAnswer: E:The shopworker\n\nInput: What are the items the parent can help with that include washing the dishes?

A: the bathrooms are associated with cleaning, thus you would most likely not put lotion on your body.\n3. B: they could put lotion on at the bath, but then after bathing you would most likely get to the dryer afterwards.\n4. C: the bath wouldn't work, since that's only for if you are bathing.\n5. D: this is most likely true, they would get out in their room to sleep.\n6.

{"text": "record is 'erasing'.\n7. The choice that can most appropriately represent 'burning the record's' figurative meaning is then option D: erase.\nAnswer: D. erase\n\nInput: They broke down in the forest, why would it happen? Choices: 1. A: hungry B: lost C: scared D: trapped E: snow\nRationales: This question can be best answered by first identifying the context clues. We are provided the statement that they were in a forest when breaking down occurred. We need to identify why exactly they broke down.\n\nConsidering the available options, each can be effectively cross-referenced with different reasons as to why something could occur.\n1. We can rule out 'they were hungry' and 'they were lost'. By using the provided context, it is clear that being hungry and being lost do not cause vehicle breakdowns. These are more likely to cause traveling distress or inconvenience rather than vehicle breakdowns.\n\n2. We can also rule out 'they were scared'. By using the provided statement, it is clear the forest is most likely not a life-threatening or dangerous situation but it is most likely a difficult one to navigate. It is very unlikely this would lead to a vehicular breakdown.\n\n3. We can cross reference the provided statement with 'trapped' which can mean blocked in or unable to escape. This can imply a problem that may require a mechanical repair. This seems like the most likely scenario to represent why the vehicle broke down.\n\n4. We can also cross reference the provided statement to'snow'. Although snow can lead to vehicle breakdowns, it is most likely to cause breakdowns due to vehicular damage and difficulty driving. This would most likely lead to the need for mechanical repairs rather than 'trapped' and'scared'.\n\n5. The remaining choice, 'they were hungry', seems to better match the context and implications given by the statement. Therefore, the best choice to answer the question will be 1: they were hungry.\nAnswer: 1: They were hungry.\n\nInput: They took off the pumpkin, which is what they were using to cook?

Therefore, all of them fall in that category and we can eliminate D: rain. This leaves us with sand and water, from which we get ice and clouds.\n\nAnswer: A: froth and B: ice\n\nInput: The student was given a scholarship, what type of financial aid? Choices: 1. A: grant\n2. B: grant 3. C: loan 4. D: loan 5. E: loan 6. F: gift\nRationales:  \nStep 1: The question asks for the type of financial aid. This can be one of the following- grant, loan, gift.\nStep 2: Considering the type of aid each word is- loan for loan and gift and the options that fit the criteria of aids we are given, the option we can eliminate are- loan and gift.\nStep 3: Considering the options that are left, the option that is a scholarship has the same type. The options of loan and gift are aid, they are not scholarships.

Therefore, 'erasing history' is the best answer.\nAnswer: C: erasing history\n\nInput: The man told her that he would like to see her house, what could they expect? Choices: 1. A: new furniture 2. B: family members 3. C: a visit 4. D: to live in the house E: a contract for future housing\nRationales: The question presents a scenario in which a man has asked to visit a woman's house and she has agreed. It is asking for what that visit may implicate or infer about her house and the relationship between the man and woman. It is asking us to analyze each choice and evaluate what it could indicate.\n\n1. When we evaluate choice option 'new furniture' and contextualize'man wants to see house', a person may wish to buy new furniture because they are trying to spruce up a house.\n2. So, option A is acceptable.\n\n3. Option B, 'family members, could conceivably mean the house may have family members. However, it doesn't say this explicitly and there's no need to introduce this element for someone to visit a place.\n\n4. Option C states the man has said he wants to visit her house and the woman agrees. The word 'visit' isn't related to any of the other choices which are about events in which new furniture, family members, or contracts for future housing are bought or arranged. \n\n5. Additionally, the man has said his 'house' and she has agreed which is not about moving, furniture, or contracts.\n\n6. Option D is also unrelated as it doesn't include any reference to home, living in, or furniture.\n\n7. Option E is potentially the best choice because it presents elements that could be related or be in service with what a man might infer from visiting a woman's house. A contract could, in some contexts, be in service to helping a person live in a house and thus, the contract could imply the woman is about to start living in the man's home.\n8. Therefore. The answer is E: a contract for housing.\nAnswer: E: a contract for house\n\nInput: You were waiting for the train, what could you be holding in your hand? Cho", "answer": "A: reality"}

Choices: A: a gun B: nothing C: no gun D: money E: no body\nRationales: The question wants you to infer that the suspect left his/her gun in the car, which was stolen. As a result, the police recovered the gun.\n\nThis was not the suspect's only option for leaving the car, so no other option could possibly have been the correct answer. Choice A: a gun is not the right answer. Choice B: nothing: The police could not have found something in the empty and stolen car. Choice C: no gun: The police could not expect to find a gun in a car that was not stolen for that reason.\n\nChoice D: money: The suspect could not have left money in the car, as they would surely not go through all that trouble of stealing the car, only to forget to take the money\n\nBased on the given clues and the question, the most likely answer is: (C) that the police found no gun.\nanswer: C: found no gun", "answer": "D: garage"}

Therefore the only choice that can be considered as an answer is 'erase'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: How can a person get money? Choices: . A: working fulltime job B: win an election C: stealing D: work E: donations \nRationales: It is the same thing: 1. Since the word 'cash' is used only for getting money, all the options related to other form of money/payment are not answers.\n2. Election process isn't the right choice because winning an election requires a lot of process and money. And election money only goes to campaigning.\n3. Winning a lottery doesn't guarantee cash money. A cash prize maybe awarded as a result of a lottery or similar games of chance.\n4. Stealing isn't an answer because some people in jail are there for money related crime, but it doesn't guarantee cahs.\n5. Donation option is not answer as it doesn't get someone money and the amount from donation is never big enough to get cash money.\n6. Only a fulltime job is an answer.\nAnswer:.A: working fulltime job\n\nInput: It can be a type of dog. It can be a type that people have to get help to walk. What is it?

We have to consider all the choices and see which one fits.\n2. None of the options match this question which is why they were eliminated.\n3-4. Next we consider the four answers that are left.\n5. A and B are breeds of dogs which aren\u2018t right for the task.\n6. The task involves needing help to do something, and the options C and D make more sense as tasks that necessitate a guide of some kind.\n7.

Choices: 1. A: introduction 2. B: complaint 3. C: excuse 4. D: speech 5. E: welcome\nRationales: Given the choice options, which one is the most suitable as the first part at work?\n1. An introduction is a statement by a speaker that introduces the topic or the reason why the speaker is speaking, and it may not include other people's presence.\n2. A complaint is an expression of dissatisfaction, typically about something that is inconvenient, unpleasant, or unfulfilling.\n3. An excuse is a reason, an explanation for doing or failing to do something.\n4. A speech is a talk or formal address usually given by an individual to a large group of people.\n5. A welcome is an action of providing a pleasure, approval, or a good reception.\n\n1. Choice A is ruled out as an 'introduction' is different from other choices in terms of the speaker's presence.\n\n2. Choice B is also ruled out as a 'complaint' is different from other options in terms of a different content or objective purpose.\n\n3. 'Excuse' is ruled out as excuse has a different purpose versus objectives compared to other options.\n\n4. 'Speech' is also ruled out as speech has a different purpose compared to other options. \n\n5. At last, 'welcome' is ruled in because of its similar content with 'welcome' which is one of the choice options.\n\nTherefore, the correct response will be choice 4 only.\n\nAnswer: Choice 4: D: speech\n\n### Instructions:The following sentence refers to a picture.

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: D: erase\n\nInput: What does the person in the elevator say when they go downstairs? Choices:  C: bye-bye D: good morning E: good afternoon F: good night\nRationales: There are a few steps required in order to arrive at the right answer.\n\n1. We have to start with understanding and identifying each option presented in the question - A, B, C, D, E, F.\n2. Then, we'll evaluate all the options individually to understand whether each option is relevant or not.\n3. As we can see after analyzing the options, some of them might seem to be possible but they don't make sense when seen together with the context.\n4. For example - 'good night' seems like a possible response but it doesn't match up with the context as the elevator ride downstairs takes place in daytime.\n5. To understand that none of the options are the right answer, we should evaluate each of the alternative from the perspective of the person who takes an elevator downstairs, so they can either say the options themselves to the people in the elevator, or they can hear the option from the passengers.\n6. After analyzing the perspective of the person taking the elevator down, we can see that only the options D and E may seem like appropriate responses if one of the elevator ride participants said any of them.\n7. The reason being, if the elevator ride was a downward one and if one passenger in it decided to say bye-bye to all the other participants, they will sound like a stranger to the other participants who may not have the same intention or perspective as them.\n8. Similarly, if anyone said good morning or good afternoon to the other participants, the other would only respond with bye-bye to politely bid them goodbye. Good morning and good afternoon are not suitable responses from a person downstairs.\n9. Therefore, the only possible and logical options are D and E.\n10. Further, both D and E are relevant and appropriate responses from a stranger, because these are standard greetings in the context of a daytime elevator ride.\n11. So, the answer should be either D or E.\n12. To arrive at the correct answer, you should eliminate the other options for the following reasons.", "answer": "D: missing out"}

Choices:  D: cleaning it B: keeping it C: getting help D: working on it E: getting rid of it\nRationales: This question involves analyzing the role of taking out the trash and how it may pertain to cleaning a room.\n\nStep 1: Examine the question to identify the keywords and phrases. The words that give away the intention of the question are `you`,`trash`,`room`.\n\nStep 2. Break these keywords down and evaluate the options.\n\nStep 2a: Consider what options are the most likely to be associated with removing trash.\n\nStep 7b: Determine which of the options can be eliminated, and why.\n\nStep 9b: Identify which option is the best match to the question. Choices C and D relate to 'keeping' the room, which doesn't make sense here, so we can remove those.\n\nStep 0c: Consider what options make practical sense in this context.\n\nStep cd: We can eliminate the option of getting 'help' to clean the room because this option is too vague - help could range from simply giving a quick hand to completing the entire task at once, so this answer isn't specific enough. Another issue with this answer is that cleaning a room is usually undertaken by the inhabitants of that room or, at most, a house cleaner, and it's not something you 'take out of the room' as in throw it out into the trash, so this answer doesn't make sense either.\n\nStep ae: One thing is clear: the right answer is B as it is the only option that's specific enough and makes logical sense.", "answer": "A: pub"}

{"text": "record is'rewrite'.\nAnswer: (B): rewrite\n\nInput: What type of device is used to measure the distance of lightning from the ground? Choices: \nA: light B: air pollution C: speedometer D: sound level meter E: lightning detector\nRationales: Given the following options, the question asks which are suitable tools for measuring the distance of lightning strikes from the ground; the right option is the one that measures the distance in question.\n\n7. \n\"Lightning\" refers to thunder, not the thing that is measured in question. Lightning is very different from light, air pollution, sound levels, and lightning detector.\n\n8. \n\"Sound level meter\" is probably not the best option because a sound level meter doesn't have a scale to measure distance; rather, it measures sound levels which are different from the distance in question. \n\n9. \n\"Air pollution\" is not related to lightning; lightning does not cause air pollution. Also, air pollution is a more general term used to describe a broad category of harmful, toxic, and noxious substances that may find their way into the atmosphere due to various human activities such as industry. \n\n10. \n\"Speedometer\" is not the answer because it measures speeds, not distances.\n\n11. \n\"Light\" is perhaps the most ambiguous option. It is often used to describe lightning and is also a term from physics to measure the intensity of light in a beam of light. It seems to have a scale for distance; however, light measured this way usually does not mean the distance from ground to strike but rather the electromagnetic or visible light.\n\n12. \n\"Lighning detector\" is the most suitable for what the OP is asking because it is the tool that measures lightning strikes from ground. \nAnswer: \n(D): \nlightning detector\n\nInput: What are most suitable for putting around pets?

Choices:  C: necklaces  A: food B: baskets D: pants\nRationales: Given that people are selling items at a market in Africa, let's determine the most likely type of items they would be selling. \n\nStep A-C: The most reasonable options are: food, baskets, and clothes or fabrics.\n\nStep A: We know that there is a marketplace in Africa selling various kinds of foods, vegetables, and fruits so the possibility that they are selling food items is very likely.\n\nStep B: It is highly likely that people may bring baskets to the market to sell. They would then be filled with various kinds of foods and goods.\n\nStep C: Clothes are most likely to be sold at a market because people would like to get rid of old clothes they do not wear or no longer use.\n\nStep C-D: The least likely options are necklaces and pants. Necklaces can be bought at a market but they are not very likely to be sold in a high volume, at least not the size that would require multiple people to sell it. Pants can also be sold because they usually come in large quantities and sizes, however, the most common type of pants sold are usually cheap, short ones so we may conclude that selling multiple pants will be mostly limited to local markets and not a large global export market like the African market.\n\nStep A is the most appropriate response, the people are selling food. \nAnswer: A: food\n\nInput: The two people were talking what was being? Choices: A: lunch B: a movie C: a movie D: a dinner E: lunch\nRationales: The question asks about a conversation about what is being eaten by the two parties, namely a lunch. The answer can be evaluated by identifying the most logical option based on the context.\n\nStep A-E: The correct option is lunch instead of a movie, dinner, and other options. This is because the lunch option describes an actual part of the conversation and it has the most impact on the overall meaning of the interaction.\n\nStep A There should be no", "answer": "A: sights"}

Analyze the question by determining what type of search is being inferred from the phrasing.\n2. Consider each of the answers and try to evaluate which seems to be the best choice to describe the reason as to why someone may be searching for pants and shirt.\n3. Since the person could be searching for pants because they are on sale, they are of a particular brand, or they fit well, the choice that best fits this reasoning is 'on sale'.\nAnswer: A: on sale\n\nIn this type of question, the correct answer typically fits within the context of the given scenario, not necessarily within the grammatical structure.\n\nInput: The student is playing on the basketball court, they are using the object to make what?

Choices: \n\nRationales: The question asks us to figure out the tool that is used for the end goal, which in this case, is the mouth. Our options given are a comb, a brush, a broom and a hairbrush.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate them in terms of their potential relation to the phrase used. An end is typically the goal or final point of an object. While brushes are used to clean and maintain hair, brooms are used to clean floors and hairbrushes are indeed used to brush hair, they do not have the potential of being an end in the sense of the question.\n\nStep 2. Consider combs. While combs and combing are indeed the practice of cleaning, combing is ineffective for the purpose of cleaning your mouth. Combs are often used by men to comb their hair after a shower, but not usually used for the purpose of cleanliness.\n\nStep 7. This leaves us with the choice of brushes. Since the end goal is using a tool to your mouth, they have the potential of being the tool used. Additionally, while combs are used to brush your hair, brushes are typically used to clean and maintain your teeth, which does have the potential of fulfilling the end goal of the question, though it isn't the most direct use.\n\nAnswer: C: brush\n\nInput: What does the 3rd grade class do in their school? \nChoices: Choose one option.

Choices: 1. A: making out with 2. B: talking to 3. C: making out with 4. D: talking to 5. D: talking to\nRationales: The question is asking about two different kinds of interaction.\n\nChoices A&D are the two most likely, they are both related to physical contact.\n\nChoices B&C are more about mental/verbal interaction.\n\nBoth D&E make little sense in this context, unless they are also physical contact.\n\nConsider the whole word. Makeout could refer to: kissing, rubbing, groping, etc.. All of which involve physical contact in some sense or another. If these are possible choices, then makeout can also refer to a form of mental/verbal.\n\nIn this case, we want our answer to be as specific as possible.\n\nThus, the two options with a clear link between contact and mental/verbal are choice D&E.\n\nAnswer: C: either talking to (verbal/mental) or making out with (physical).\n\n### Instructions for the next student:\nIn the next response provide the author's response and the author's reasoning.

{"text": "record, is 'erasing'.\nAnswer: A: erasing\n\nInput: What does your father feel if you give him a hug? Choices:  B: anger C D: love E: affection F: rejection\nRationales: Let's start by analyzing the question and determining the type of answer we're searching for. The phrase 'what does your father feel' is suggestive of a general feeling or emotion. Because of this, we're seeking an answer associated with an emotion.\nThere are six options but only two of them deal with physical sensations: D, love and A, affection. \nWe can eliminate choices C, anger, and F, rejection, as they are related to physical pain. \nAs we've already discussed above, choices B, A, D, and F are related to body sensations, therefore B, A, and D cannot be the solution.\n\nNow, let's focus on love and affection. Love is a feeling, but it's not an emotional state. An implication is that love isn't exclusively tied to body sensation. \nIf we consider a scenario in which someone loves their father and also gives them a hug, this would not necessarily lead to a heightened level of love. \nInstead, affection (a general showing of love via body sensation) would be the appropriate response.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice is A, affection.\nAnswer: A affection", "answer": "A: hair salon"}

Choices:  F: lost the position G: didn't get paid H: lost the job J: didn't get a job\nRationales: Start by analyzing each choice.\n\nStep 1: We start by looking at the choice 'F: lost the position'. If someone gets a job and then quits that job, they may technically 'lose the job', so this choice could be a suitable answer choice.\n\nStep: Another choice is 'G: didn't get [paid]'. While this choice could also be a possible answer to the question, 'paid' could refer to salary, not the actual job itself. The actual job is technically the job and not the money. So, that choice may be eliminated.\n\nStep: Evaluate choice 'H: lost the job'. This choice is an option that could be associated with quitting, so we may need to analyze the context and see which choice better fits with the question. In context, the question is asking if the person took the position to begin with, so that choice may not be a suitable answer.\n\nStep: Now, consider choice 'I: didn't get (a) job'. This choice, in contrast, may technically be an answer choice that we can consider. If a person applies at a business or company for a job, they may 'not get the job', but this does not really mean they 'didn't get the job'. In fact, if they are not 'employed by that job' they 'would not lose the job', meaning they were only applying but weren't actually hired. Still, this could potentially be an answer.\n\nStep. Continuing, we should evaluate choice 'J: didn't get an job'. The main difference between the two choices mentioned above is the preposition 'at' in choice 'didn't apply', which means the job is not associated with an employment situation. In contrast, 'an' could refer to a job from a single company, as it could be an employee who is not working with the specific company they are currently not employed at. It could also be a job they are working at with a different company. Due to the specific", "answer": "B: lie down"}

Option A: death, does not seem to fit within the sequence of considering something because it is an instant decision without thinking much.\n\n2. Option B: adoption, could be within the considerations because they are not planning to kill a dog.\n\n3. Option C: cost, could also be considered if they choose to buy the dog.\n\n4. Option D: medical, can be associated with Adoption or death considerations. In the first scenario, it could be a medical decision of rehabilitation, in the second scenario, it could be medical checkup before adoption.\n\n5. Option E: color, could also be related to death considerations. For example, when adopting it is important to make a choice based on an emotional connection with the dog.\n\n6.

The apple is round, but it doesn't have a hole.\nLastly, let's talk briefly about the right choices. \n1. Do we make a cake in an oven? A: oven. Yes.\n2. Do kids eat cereal? A: cereal. Yes. (not sure if this one is correct) Cereal has one hole.\nWe can get the correct choice by eliminating these wrong answers, using:\n1. Do kids eat CEREAL? A: cereals. No.\n2.\"Do kids eat\" is incorrect, correct question is: \"Do we eat\"?\n3.\"Do kids eat a donut\" A: donut. No. (donut has hole in center)\nNow, we'll get to the answer. B: donut. We eat a donut.

Between the sky and land 4. Anywhere a river is 5. By some hills\nRationales: From the choices given here, consider each choice and their role in creating a boundary. We can eliminate choices that either don't fall in the given 'natural' definition or don't create the boundary.\n1. At sea and at ocean are both ways of describing one body of water. That may create a boundary, but is not part of the given context.\n2. Between the sky and the land is also not in line with the given natural parameter.\n3. Boundaries involving rivers are not specifically mentioned in the question. While it may be a natural boundary, it is not the type of boundary that is most relevant for the question.\n\n4. Similarly, boundaries involving hills would not necessarily be a natural boundary as they would be defined by natural landscape. They may be natural boundaries, but the 'natural' parameter of the question only applies to a boundary with nature.\n\n5. From the remaining choices, ocean and land are both natural. We can eliminate the land boundary and consider choosing ocean as a natural boundary. But the ocean is a separate body of water, which does not necessarily delineate a boundary with nature. \n\nAnswer: 12. Choice:  Ocean.", "answer": "D: attractive appearance"}

Choices: 1: A: Yes B: No C: Wait D: Tip tip E: Say no\nRationales: To decide which of the options is correct, we need to evaluate whether there is an actual question in the text. Here, the text only makes an implication by comparing the customer's answers with what they did.\n1. Since there is no question, only an assumption, there is no correct or wrong answer possible, so we can eliminate options D: Tip tip, E: Say no.\n2. If we consider other options, only choice C: Wait is the most likely response to the implied question.\n3. The customer is in the taxi, after being in the shop. In that case they probably will wait until they arrive in their home to decide if they want the box.\nAnswer: C: Wait\n\nInput: You are looking for a particular book, you find out it is currently being read by two people, what can you do to find it? Choices:  a: Go to another store b: See who is reading it c: Keep searching d: Ask to borrow it e: Find a different book\nRationales: If we try to understand the implied question, there are two possibilities.\n1. You can't find the book, and you're not interested in it. So, option C (Keep searching) seems the most viable option here.\n2. You're interested in the book. In this case, you'll want to approach either of the two persons who are reading it. So options E (Find a different book) and B (See who is reading it) seem the most sensible options here.\n\nAnswer: B: See who is reading the book\n\nInput: She will have to work on her birthday; can she get any compensation?

Choices: \nA: to socialize B: to eat and socialize C: to get a drink D: to talk to a friend E: to talk to a family member\nRationales: Choose the statement that describes the activity occurring.\n1. Analyze the scenario provided.\n2. If we ask the question \"What does she want\", then A: to socialize would be most appropriate, because an outdoor patio is a place someone would go to socialize (hence the socializing options are the best choices, we can eliminate the options where we talk to a family member or a friend, because they aren't related to the activity being described, and D: to talk to talk to a friend, because the context given is \"she is talking\" which implies talking to someone (and not talking to oneself).\n3. It is to be noted that B: to eat and to socialize is not a good choice either, because she is not described as eating while socialising, it was the people sitting at another table, she was describing that.\n4. Thus, it is A: to socialize, because it is the only option that describes best the activity being discussed, and the only that matches the scenario.\nAnswer: A) to socialize\n\n### Demovideo Example:\nhttps://youtu.be/zPm21z2X8vE?t=253\n\n\n### Required Reading:\n* [https://www.analyzingquestions.com](https://www.analysingquestions.com)", "answer": "C: play tag"}

Choices: \nA: To keep her supervisor well informed.\nB: To get her supervisor's opinion on matters.\nC: To have greater opportunity to communicate with her supervisor.\n.D: To build a positive relationship with her boss.\nE: To make it easier to ask for a raise.\n\nRationales:\n\n1. By analysing each option we can eliminate choices with no links to the action of working under the same roof as a direct supervisor.\n2. Then, we can eliminate ones linked with reasons unrelated to her motive for working under the same roof, such as increasing the likelihood of a raise or building a more positive relationship with a boss.\n3. 'To get her supervisor' opinion' and 'To build a positive relationship' are options related to the motive for working in the same place as your supervisor, however they don't cover every reason, which was to communicate. \n4. Instead, option E, with the ability to 'ask for a raise', is an important part of 'communicating' as a benefit of communication is to ask for and/or state a request, even if it is for a raise. \n5. Therefore, the answer must be 'C: To have greater \nopportunity to communicate with her super\nvisor.'\n6.

Examine the options I and they. They both are 'future' because they are pronouns and pronouns don't necessarily refer to anything specific, they just indicate a point in time.\n\nStep 2 Examine options B, C, D, and E. \n\nBoth C and D refers to the person which is making the answer, e.g. the 'I' in the sentence. Hence, they are both 'now'.\n\nOption B is also 'now', but instead of referring to the person, it refers to the 'grandchild' which is in the future. Hence option B is future.\n\nOption E is 'now' because the'me' in the sentence refers to the person completing the answer.\n\nStep3. Now using the analysis, the best answer is choice B.\nAnswer: B\n\n\nInput: What kind of animal do you think is this?

On the other hand, the given options indicate that dogs are the smallest mammals. Hence, option A is eliminated.\n\nStep 02.

Choices:  a: leave b: say goodbye c: be quiet d: say hello e: say goodnight\nRationales: Since it's a date (a formal occasion) and they are trying to kiss then they will probably ask to do what?\n1. First, we consider whether or not the options are relevant to this formal occasion.\n2. Option a, 'leave', does not seem appropriate as it does not represent action that are associated with dates.\n3. Option b,'say goodbye', matches the context as it is a common way people say goodbye to people on a date especially if they do not wish to keep in touch.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is b: say goodbye\nAnswer: B: say goodbye\n\nInput: You want to clean a pond, you should probably grab what if you see pebbles? Choices: 1: bark 2: algae 3: sticks 4: plastic 5: snails\nRationales: The question asks about what you will grab if you notice pebbles in a pond.\n\nStep 1: The given options are (1) bark, (2) algae, (3) sticks, (4) plastic, and (5) snails.\n\nStep 2. The choices are not mutually exclusive. It is expected that you should be able to clean pebbles using the same tool you use to clean a pond or vice-versa.\n\nStep 7.

Let's think what we can eliminate:\n\n\\begin{code}\na) A horse is a Horse\n\nThis is not correct because the statement contains the same sentence with a word change.\n\nb) A horse might be beast\n\nThis is not an answer because the word horse only contains an animal that is a horse and not only the definition.\n\nc) A horse is beast?\n\nThis is also not an answer because it contains an infinite word change or it may just say anything since it is in a form of asking the other person the meaning of what a horse is. This is confusing the answer to make another answer and it cannot be eliminated so we are going to eliminate it from our choices.\n\nd) A horse is horse?\n\nThis phrase is not an answer either because it can be any animals not just horses.\n\\end{code}\n\nWe can say that A horse may be horse is the correct sentence.\n\nAnswer: E: A horse may be what a horse is\n\nInput: Where does it appear?

Choices:  C: light bulbs   B: water C: teacher D: board E: paper \nRationales: Considering both the options: 1. Light bulb: It may be relevant to lessons in Physics, but is otherwise irrelevant to classrooms.\n2. Water: It may be relevant in certain situations, but is otherwise irrelevant.\n3. It's also unnecessary to have water in classrooms, as they are not typically used in schools.\n4. Board: It may be relevant for making lesson outlines for students or making visual aids, but it's not necessary for lessons.\n5. Paper: This may be relevant in certain subjects or for learning aids. But it doesn't answer the question for lessons in general.\n6. It's also unlikely that classrooms would run out of white paper just because they have 'learned most of the lessons'. The use of paper in classrooms would vary based on students and class needs.\n7. Teacher: It isn't necessary in every classroom and many students are already able to teach themselves.\n8.

The time interval mentioned is after/before so no particular time during lunch is mentioned. Therefore, the appropriate option is \"E: mealtime.\"\n3.

Choices: \nA: new players B: young players C: older players D: people who had already played E: people over age 30\nRationales: Based on the given clues, let us reason as follows:\n\nThe question asks for 'team' which is a plural noun used for reference to a group of people playing sports.\nThere is no definite age limit specified in the question, which is why any relevant age group can be selected as the answer.\nThe noun 'players' clearly refers to a sports-related topic which refers to a 'roster' that will be displayed on a team.\nTherefore the appropriate answer choices would be plural nouns.\n\nNow, let us look at each of the options independently:\n\nB: Young players makes the most sense as a roster is usually made up of young people who are eligible to play in a particular league at a specific time. Young in this sense would refer to people under age 30 while old would refer to people above the age of 30.\n\nC: Older players may be applicable, in certain leagues, where older individuals may be eligible to play competitively. However, this may refer only to certain teams within the same league where age may not match the average age of the league as a whole.\n\nD: People who had already played may not be relevant because the players selected may not yet have any league experience.\n\nE: People over age 30 is too broad because it would include former players who may not necessarily be eligible to join a new team at the current time.\n\nBased on these inferences, the answer is B.", "answer": "A: classroom"}

Choices: 1: the play 2: the movie 3: concert 4: ballet 5: opera\nRationales: The question states that people watched a play, and asks which option best describes the time when watch people are.\n6. There are three options that describe the time of performance, i.e., 1) a movie (2 pm), 2) a play (8 pm), and 3) an opera (12 pm).\n7. One option is a concert, which describes that people were watching music, but doesn't necessarily describe time.\n8. Another option is a ballet, which is a type of dance performance without live music, that typically occurs at night.\n9.

Choices: \n\nA: A player\nB: A ball\nC: A goal\nD: An audience\nE: A goalie\nAnalyze each choice:\nOption A: The answer would be 'a player'. Soccer doesn't have an individual goal that can be taken from the playing field. \n\nOption B: A 'ball' is a round ball used in soccer. A net is a frame, not a ball.\n\nOption C: The goal is the entire net that the ball bounces off of, and this net is fixed to the playing field's corners.\n\nOption D: This option isn't related to the context of the question at all. The playing field doesn't have a built-in audience.\n\nOption E: A soccer net or goal does not have a goalie attached to it. A goalie wears certain equipment in position to block the ball from entering the net. This equipment is often not an integral or inherent part of the net itself. \n\nChoose the correct response: \n\n'A player' will work because a goalie is a player. 'A ball' is not good because the question was asking for a'soccer net', not a ball as they both are round and the size of both is the same as well.\n\n'A goal' is also incorrect because it asks for a player which is a person.

Choices:  *: front *: back of the book *: back of the dust jacket *: cover *: spine\nRationales: The question asks about the 'jacket's' side of the book, i.e., the dust jacket attached to the back of the book if it is in use.\n\n1. 'Front and back' are possible places the dust jacket might be found.\n2. 'Jacket' is referring to the dust jacket that goes around a book usually to cover it and is connected to the binding at the spine and front cover.\n3. A 'dust jacket' being on 'back', which would mean it is covering the back of the book and is not connected to anything else.\n4. So, the answer could be 'C: side of book' or 'B: dust jacket'.\n\nHowever, both options are unlikely as dust jackets usually attach at the spine.\n\n5.

We should first understand what is meant by 'empty', in this context.\n3. 'Empty' in this case could imply that the shop was shut, empty or it doesn't matter whether people who wear shoes or not.\n4. The following choices 'buying shoes', 'wearing shoes' can't be logically used as the meaning of 'empty' which is given to us.\nSo, we should eliminate them as they are not appropriate.\n5.

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: B: erase\n\nInput: It seems that person would want to do what? Choices: 1. have a good time 2. take a break 3. relax 4. enjoy something 5. have the day off\nRationales: Here we want to determine what is most likely from an objective point of view since the choice depends on what is meant by \"enjoy something\"\n\n1. First, consider each choice. 1. 'Have a good time' is a subjective opinion about 'enjoy something' and is not necessarily connected directly to the choice.\n2. 'Relax' and 'take a break' are likely to be associated with not being stressed or tired, which could be seen by them as \"having a good time\"\n3. 'Enjoy something' could be a reason someone \"has a good time\", but it could also be associated with \"taking a break\" and is relatively vague. This is the main reason we will rule out these options and move on to the rest. \n4. 'Have the day off' could simply reflect being too tired to do something, rather than an objective association with their choice.\n5. 'EnjoySomething' is a vague option that doesn't necessarily reflect a \"good time\" and is most closely associated with \"taking breaks\" or \"relaxes\"\n6. Thus, we can conclude 'take a break' and'relax' are the only choices more objectively connected to the action of taking a break, since they are more closely related to the reason for taking a break rather than the actual action.\n7. Finally, we can then rule out'relax' and 'take a breake', since they are more closely associated with \"enjoying yourself\" rather than simply \"taking a break\".\nAnswer: D: take a break\n\nInput: Which one might be in charge of buying a car? Choices:  C: the CEO  D: manager  E: accountant  F: business owner\nRationales: In our scenario, the question is asking who is most likely the person who is in charge of buying the car.\n1.

Choices: A: restaurant B: retailer C: farmer D: storefront E: bank\nRationales: The question specifically asks about buying from a grocery store. This lets you determine that a grocery store offers food items for purchase.\nRather than looking at a food item by itself, you will look at food items grouped together as foods that a consumer intends to purchase and take home.\nIf you were to buy, for example, some apples, you would do this, as well as buy all of the other foods you intend to eat.\nTherefore, a grocery store is a collection of food items.\n\nWhen considering each answer choice, you may find that some have multiple answers because there are several potential foods that can be sold at each type of place, or some answer choices, such as a grocery store, can fall under more than one potential answer choice category.\n\nAnswer: E: bank\n  \nInput: In this kind of foods, there is a lot of protein.

{"text": "record is 'destroy'.\nAnswer: B: destruct\n\nInput: What type of thing is used to control a car? Choices:  B: steering wheel C: gas D: brake pads E: clutch\nRationales:\n1. The question presents the opportunity to analyze four different phrases used to distinguish specific items. Each phrase has its own meaning or significance.\n2. The phrase 'car control' is associated with the phrases about brake pads, steering wheel, clutch, and gas.\n3. Each of the four options is a form of control. It follows that these options all serve as 'car controls'. The given options cannot be eliminated as incorrect.\n4. We can further consider these options to determine the best fit based on their function or purpose.\n5. The phrases about'steering wheel' and 'clutch' can be considered as a part or feature of cars. These controls are directly linked to how you drive and control the car. They therefore need to be included in the answer.\n6. The phrase about 'brake pads' denotes an aspect of the car. However, the phrase can be more broadly identified as a braking mechanism. This is not essential to how you control the car; brakes are also part of the vehicle. Therefore, it needs to be included in the response.\n\n7. The phrase about 'gas' denotes that something is required for the movement; it needs to be included with the response.\n\n8. The best fit is'steering wheel, clutch & brake pads'. \nAnswer: B: steering wheel, cluth & brake pads\n\nInput: After she received her new dress, the celebrations began?

These phrases are 'after the celebration' and 'after the celebrations began'.", "answer": "B: unbreakable"}
{"text": "record is option D, 'play music'.\nAnswer: D: play music\n\nInput: Are they going to do a movie in an office? Choices:  Sounds like: A: no B: yes C: yes E: yes F: who knows\nRationales: The question provides a set of sounds to consider and asks to choose one that expresses the answer. There are two things to note for this question:\n\n1. The word \"like\" signifies that our answer should not be exact.\n2. A \"movie in an office\" sounds unlikely, so we can rule it out as a possibility. However, the other sounds, including \"no\", \"yes\", \"yes\", and \"who knows\" can happen in the context of a workplace or business. These are appropriate answers.\nNow that the two things to consider have been outlined, we can move on to answering the question.\n\nFor \"no\", there is nothing related to an office or location that would describe this choice to someone. For example, if your partner says, \"I am going to the mall\", you're more likely to answer that they will go to a \"mall\" rather than a \"shopping center\". Similarly, if your partner says \"I'm going to the mall\" and you want to confirm whether that means \"mall\" or \"shopping center\", you're more inclined to respond with \"what kind?\" rather than \"who knows?\".\n\nNext, consider \"yes\". This option is more generic. There are office-related actions, locations, and objects (\"office\", \"business\", \"money\", \"employee\", \"department\", \"building\", etc.) in which this option would be a reasonable response. To someone else asking \"Are they going to do a ________ in an office?\" there may be many different things the speaker could be describing, and the appropriate answer that would be a common response is \"yes\".\nNow, let's consider \"yes\". \"Yes\" is more specific than \"Yes\" because it refers to a specific action while \"Yes\" is a broad response that could be about any number of things (\"doing\", \"watching\", \"making\", \"walking\", \"talking\", etc.) that happen in an office.\nFinally, let's consider F, \"who knows\".

Choices:  S: parent T: teacher H: sibling M: babysitter\nRationales: Questions involving children in a class context typically ask \"who can students most often find with them?\"\n\n1. \"With\" is a verb that indicates a relationship between subjects. There is no \"with\" subject for option S.\n2. Option T has \"teacher\" as the subject. There is no verb that can link the action of having \"class\" with this verb. The action of having \"class\", as represented by \"in class\" precludes the question from focusing on the teacher's presence in this scenario.\n3. A sibling has similarities and a relationship to a parent. There is no verb to suggest these similarities or relationship.\n4. Same issue with options H and M, they are too specific to the relationship indicated in the context the question.\n5.

Choices: 1. A: it made it softer 2. B: to have more flowers 3. C: the color matched the dress 4. D: for the sake of her mom 5. E: her mom was one of the two\nRationales: A. The bride chose two flowers on her bouqtet because she wanted a softer bouquet. The fact that a bouquet is often made of flowers and not a singular flower lends to this option being the correct one. B. The bride chose more flowers because she wanted the bouquet to be softer. C. When the bride chose two flowers with her bouquet, the color did not match her dress. So, her bouquet was soft, but the color was not relevant to the choice. D. The bride chose the two flowers for her bouquet for the sake of her own preference.

There are a couple of options given to the person to choose from. We can start by eliminating the ones that don't make sense as the ones that are given here aren't likely to be able to be offered to the guest.  \n\"B: hotel stay\" is not reasonable because that is not something that is given to guests. It is not a common action that anyone plans to give.  \n\"C: Movie tickets\" also does not make sense since this is not a common gift. Also, this option isn't mentioned anywhere in the paragraph.  \n\"D: Restaurant vouchers\" is also unlikely as that does not fit within the scenario that is stated here. Plus, that too is not mentioned.  \nSo, the only choice that seems to make sense is \"E: none, they can't stay over\", which indicates that the guest cannot actually stay over because that is not a common action to do.\n\n### Rationales:\nIn order to answer this question, we must recognize that the word 'tobacco' could represent any type of tobacco product.

The words are: carpet/replacement/where, and replace/carpet/where.\n\nWe will focus on carpet and replacement which are opposing terms, for a replacement to be an acceptable answer choice the carpet must be already placed somewhere or be replaced elsewhere.\n\nFurthermore, the correct logical sequence of answers follows the sequence \u2231, \u222f, \u2233. Considering, the options in the order D-B-E-F, the first answer choice must not fit the logical order sequence, which excludes D from being a correct answer because it is not a replacement. The sequence that follows a logical answer order would be F-B-E-\u2231. Since F - B is the oppositional sequence, we need to consider either the replacement is in F or not. Considering, the F of the antonymic pair contains carpet and replacement, we can eliminate both F - D.\n\nNext, we should consider the logical answer sequence from the perspective of \u2231. D cannot be replaced in B, since carpet/replacement is an antonym, D is the replacement and carpet cannot be placed in a replacement location. Also, we cannot assume B - D is a logical answer due to the antonymic sequence in carpet/replacement. The logical answer sequence would be F-B because both terms fit the opposite logical sequence: \u2231 - \u222f. So, B is not a correct answer.\nWith F already ruled out, the next logical option would be E. But, carpet is not placed in the living room, so this answer choice is also eliminated because of the original premise that carpet was already placed somewhere.\nNext would be E - C because both options have the carpet placed somewhere. However, we are looking for a replacement answer option, so C is eliminated because it can't be the carpet.\n\nThus, the final option is F - D.\n \nAnswer: D: guest room\n\n### Examples of incorrect questions:\n\nInput:", "answer": "B: old people's home"}

The given options are: C: tires, B: steering wheel, D: horn, E: battery, and F: these.\n2. Tires are connected to the wheels of cars, that is certain.\n3. The battery is certainly not needed for a car to operate. It is needed to start a motor vehicle, but a car doesn't need to operate normally, it needs energy to move.\n4. A steering wheel is a necessity to control and guide the direction of the car.\n5. The horn is optional. It is used to remind pedestrians of the car by making the vehicle's noises, but the horn is optional. For example, some cars don't have one.\n6. There is no need to operate a car when it is not. It is not necessary to operate a car that is not on or does not belong to you.\n7. Finally, option F: all these implies that all options are needed to operate the car. However, option C: Tires is not a necessity to operate the car.\n8.

Choices:  B: fight C: switch team D: win E: quit\nRationales: Examine each option and evaluate their relevance to the situation described.\n\nStep 1: First, let's evaluate option A: The two teams aren't going to fight because it doesn't relate to the scenario described.\n\nStep2: Now option B: fight, doesn't seem to make sense either as it's pretty obvious that the teams aren't going fight each other.\n\nStep3: Option C: switch teams, however, could be a possibility. Afterall, the teams are playing against each other on the same day. But it's not explicitly explained that the teams' personalities in anyway conflict so it's also a less plausible answer given the other options.\n\nStep4: Option D: win is a realistic scenario as there will be a winner and loser in any game and the reason that the teams didn't work well together could be because one team was better than the other. This doesn't mean both teams aren't going work together again in the future it's just that one of them did better this match.\n\nStep5: Option E: quit seems to be the most unlikely choice as it's not the normal thing a team does after losing a game. Even if they don't like to work together again, it wouldn't be a good idea to quit because the coach or management can still decide a couple of people to keep or replace on each team.\n\nStep6: The logical choice which seems consistent with the question is option D: win because the teams didn't collaborate with each other but they will probably try again in the future.\nAnswer: D and E are eliminated as too uncommon.", "answer": "E: may laugh"}

Choices: A: ask questions B: make purchases C: return items D: do nothing\nRationales: The given choices are options A to D that can be potentially related to the actions of buying something.\n1. Option A, asking questions, is outside the context of buying something, therefore this is excluded.\n2. Option B, making purchases, fits with the context as people often buy things in shops. But, in this scenario of buying things in a shop, it is the \"store's\" responsibility to offer products.\n3. Option D, doing nothing, is not related to making purchases as it suggests no action should be taken.\n4. Option D, does not make sense in the given scenario, and is not a viable option.\n5. Options C, returning items, and A, asking questions, do not directly result in buying products as they only ask about returning the items or asking for help.\n6. Option C, returning products, has similar actions to option B as they both involve making purchases in a store. \n7.

Choices:  'A': radio B: TV C: phone E: the Internet\nRationales: This question presents a hypothetical scenario where the technology used in the year 2000 to communicate electronically in the US is unclear.\n\nThe options provided for this question are:\n\n- Radio\n\n- TV\n\n- Phone\n\n- Internet\n\n\nWith this set of options, we should examine each alternative to determine the most likely technology used in 2000.\n\nFirst, \"radio\" was a significant technology in the early 1900s, but it is unlikely to have formed the basis of communication technology in the year 2,000.\n \nSecond, \"TV\" was introduced around the start of WWII in the United States and by the year 2080 TV was well established and ubiquitous. That said, 2000 is before widespread commercial TV broadcasting at scale existed, so it is unlikely TV was the main technology used to transmit electronic communication between people at large. \n \nThird, \"phone\" while a ubiquitous technology by 2000, it seems unlikely it would be the only electronic communication device or that it played a significant role in communication. \n\nFinally, \"Internet\": by 2008, broadband internet technologies were well established in the US and the internet was considered a fundamental tool of civic life.\nBy 2000 the internet was not as developed and the infrastructure was limited, but the internet was a technology that was poised to develop into the key foundation necessary for electronic communication in the future. That said, it is more likely that people communicated over other networks during 2000 given the internet was not yet as developed.\n\nTherefore, \"Internet\" seems to be the correct answer because it is the only one of the given choices that could logically be infer", "answer": "E: surf net"}

Choices:  H: post office B: mailbox C: wall D: door E: phone\nRationales: The question asks about the location where the mail is usually available to the receiver.\n\n\n1. The most logical place to search for mail is in the post office. \n2. However, there are several potential places in which mail can be delivered and available for the receiving party to access. \n3. So, let's briefly examine each of the provided alternative options:\n4. H, post office. This is the most likely place, as this is the location where the mail would be most likely to be received as opposed to being received at a door or phone. \n\n5. This is because the post office is the location where people go to post mail, which means it is an ideal place to store additional copies of the mail.\n6. In contrast, other options B, mailbox; C, door; and D, phone; would not be very logical locations to store mail, as they do not facilitate the receiving of the mailing, in addition, the mailbox is typically attached to the door. \n\n7. Therefore, B, mailbox would be the only logical alternative option. \n8. As a result, the correct alternative is B.\n9. The full answer includes: B, mailbox.\nAnswer: B. mailbox\n\nInput: Why does the speaker say when someone leaves a group they don't care about? Choices: A: They've never cared.

Choices:  books_of_accounts: A: books D: books in a library B: history E: children C: text book\nRationales: Given the context of the previous three questions, they give us a great clue that the book they speak of is indeed history.\n1. With those assumptions in mind, we can eliminate answer choice B: books in a library for that reason. If this \"book\" was in a library in the past, why would it need to be written down?\n2. We still have to consider the other answer choices with the assumption established, and we can eliminate answer choice C: books in a library because the word 'books' appears twice in this question, and thus we can assume that books in a library have been discussed at least once.\n3. Eliminating answer choice B: books, we have eliminated two of the four answer choices as being possible. We are left with four, the most number of choices possible. We can eliminate answer choice E: texts as we don't have the specificity that it \"need to be [...],\" though the context we've established would allow us to eliminate this possible answer based on the logic that there is no reason to write down a textbook.\n\n4. It leaves answer choice A: books_of_account, as the answer. With the above logic, we are able to eliminate four of the eight possible answer choices with the available knowledge, leaving four. We still have two answer choices to eliminate.\n5. Because the answer is written as two words together, and so it makes sense to have answer choices where the two words are together as two words.\n6. To eliminate answer choice D: Books, we would have to find a specific logical reason to eliminate this answer. For example if answer choice C did not include 'in a' as two words together as answer choice D does. However, to eliminate answer choice D due to the choice of words we would have to have already been able to eliminate option B because of the repetition in it's inclusion, so we can only eliminate B and C.\n7.

It's necessary to understand what the person needs from the doctor.\n\nAnswer: C: Eyes\n\nInput: What does the person use on a regular basis? Choices: 4 A: hair 5 B: oil 6 C: perfume\nRationales: The choice is \"what does the person use on...\" meaning this person is using something on a regular basis. \n7. There's no logical reason that hair or perfume could be used on a regular basis, so the options for these can be eliminated as they are incorrect.\n\n8. 'Oil' is generally not considered something that this person uses on a particular location on a regular basis.\n9. So, the only possible answer from what remains could be 'body' as they are referring to the part of the body where hair may grow.\n10. Therefore, the answer could be B: 'oil'.\n11.

First of all, let's consider options B, 'physician assistant', C, 'nurse', D, 'therapist' and E, 'dentist'.\n\n4. None of these options provides specific answers to either of the tasks above so we can eliminate them all.\n5. Option A, 'doctor' is only an identity not an answer to either of the tasks.\n\n6.

These are G, F, I, B and H.\n\nStep 2. Examine each of these words to see what they can tell us about what each word actually means.\n\nStep 7. Note that the first paragraph of the question contains a phrase - \"made a cake.\" The word'made' is an action verb that tells us that some action took place regarding a cake.\nThis means the action of making the cake is important.\n\nStep 9. Now look at the items in the list. None of them make sense in terms of this action. \n\nStep: 13. Thus, the answer must be oven.

Choices:  vase A: hold B: place C: mix D: fill E: pour\nRationales: First, it is necessary to determine how the vase relates to the water.\n\nStep 1: Analyse each of the given answers.\n\nStep 2. By analysing the options, it should be clear that 'hold' and 'place' are incorrect. These simply do not fit with the concept of a vase holding water.\n\nStep 'fill' and 'pour' could be the reason the vase holds the water, but the question doesn't ask about the water holding the vase, it's asking about how the water changes after it's put in the vase.\n\nStep'mix' would require the vase to be able to move the water but they usually do not. Also, vases do not mix any ingredients of their own.\n\nTherefore, the answer will be'mix'. \n\nNow, let's take a closer look at each answer and determine if it is compatible with the question. \n\nStep There are actually two options that fit with the answer'mix', namely 'combine' and 'blend'. \n\nStep However, combining is a mixing process that requires two or more items to combine together while blending requires only one item, so the answer will be 'blend'.\nStep The question doesn't indicate the presence of colour, so we can safely eliminate 'colour', 'add colour' or 'change colour' from the selection.\nStep However, adding ingredients to the question implies that they're usually added in an order, so the answer 'add ingredients in order' will not be the solution.\nStep 'add ingredients' also is acceptable, as the vase can accept ingredients in bulk, allowing you to drop or pour the ingredients inside and fill the vase all at once. \nStep 'add all ingredients' does not match the requirement as it implies that you need to add each ingredient. This matches with adding in order. If you mix one ingredient, the others could just be dropped after.\nStep 'add' is compatible", "answer": "B: map"}

The question is asking how long an eon lasts.\n2. Now lets look at the given choices: 10, 20, 30. The question is about how long. These numbers are not in how long units.\n3.

First of all salt does not occur naturally. \n\n4. It is only obtained from seas. So, if there is salt, then there must be sea. \n\n5. It is impossible to find salt in oceans, seas and lakes. \n\n6. Now, let's consider options C & D: These should be dropped out because the context says salt has to come from the sea. \n\n7. Option \"E\" also stands out.

C: 4:00 AM Saturday D: 10:00 AM Saturday E: Sunday 3. A: 2:00 PM Sunday\nRationales: Analyze each one, using 1, for example:\n3. What is the most plausible reason for a person to not get up in the morning of a week day? The first three can be ruled out due to their relation to a weekday, so we start looking at Saturday and Sunday. Saturday has to be a weekend for the job, and there would not be any reason for waking up so early if the job starts at 4am on a Saturday, therefore this is not likely the answer. \n3. On a Sunday, people typically like to sleep in and not wake up so early. However, someone working on a weekend would likely wake up early for that day. On the other hand, when they return to work on Monday, the job starts at 2pm so they could sleep in. Therefore, we can also eliminate this option. \n1. What is the most significant reason for people to stay up late on a Saturday night? The answer is \"a party\" and we can eliminate'sunset Saturday', the option referring to the time of a sunset. \n2. What is the purpose of setting an alarm or waking up at a time close to an event? The answer would be to be able to participate in it or be done in time. '4AM Saturday' falls short of this as it is too early and would likely mean you would be exhausted or tired. '10AM Saturday' is too late as it is not enough time to prepare yourself to participate. Therefore, we can rule out the choice. \n3. What would be the best time to enjoy the day after spending so much time working or resting? We can eliminate the choice because you would likely wake up in the morning on Sunday. \n2. Saturday morning is when people typically sleep in.

Choices: \u2717 \u2717  A: eat snack B: go camping C: go home D: talk about fishes E: go to bed \n\n\nRationales: Note that questions such as \"What should one do in this situation?\" are usually rhetorical and require a general statement and not an actual action. Additionally, the choices were given in a logical order (e.g., \"got from fishing trip =>... should do\") which may be less common but is acceptable.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is D: talk about the fish. One would naturally think of talking about one's catch (how large or small, whether it was a big or little fish, etc.).

Choices: \u2027\u2027\u202b A: Increased self- esteem B: getting ready C: feeling tired D: Eager\nRationales: In this scenario you are choosing among the choices the most likely response to a person who received a promotion.\nAnswer:\u2027\u202c\u202bC:\u2027\u2b20 \nAn example of feeling tired is good for a person that just received a promotion. An increased self-esteem is good but is expected after a promotion. One could feel ready for the coming of something, but this is not the only option. Getting ready for something means a person has to have all their things in order in order to get to the location to achieve or do what's next.\n\n\\[ \\underline{Rationale}: (Answer choice C): Feeling tired is an acceptable option to feel when receiving a new promotion and an answer choice that may seem unlikely.\n\nAnswer Choice C: Feeling tired is an accepted response to receiving a promotion and may seem out of the ordinary amongst the other three responses.\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\underline{Rationale}: All four of the alternatives were unambiguous and correct.\n\nAnswer: \"Which of this is best and most common when receiving a promotion?

D: a divorce E: a new job\nRationales:  1. The phrase 'the woman didn't work' is the clue that gives us two things to know. These things are the outcome of her not working and the specific circumstance or situation that led to her not working, which is a woman. \n2. Based on this, we have to find the most relevant option which is an implication or consequence that could be derived from the scenario in the question. \n3. This is an evaluation based on the available options and considering the specific situation in the context of the question.\n4. For example, divorce would be an option where there is a failed relationship or separation from a married spouse which relates to the scenario.\n5. If a person is not working, they can't earn money and may eventually be bankrupted. Therefore, choice A would be related to a woman not working. \n6. Finally, choice D, 'a divorce', is also the most logical option for the phrase 'a woman didn't work', since a divorce would be the only logical outcome that can be derived from her not working.\nAnswer: D, Divorce\n\nInput: Who could they be talking to about a car? Choices: \u200b1. A: a plumber B: a mechanic C: a lawyer D: a dentist E: a doctor\nRationales: The options here have to be determined based on logical reasoning regarding how a situation may play out. A dentist is not a good response as their medical practice is not about taking care of cars. Similarly, a doctor's specialty is human medical care and not car care. Choice B, a mechanic is obviously correct as a mechanic works on car parts. Similarly, a plumber and a dentist are also options that could be correct. However, a lawyer has nothing to do with taking care of a car. Choice C is the most appropriate response as that provides a logical answer to the question.\nAnswer: C: a mechanic\n\nInput: Where can you do some hiking? Choices: \u20601.

Choices:  a: the processing charge b: credit card fraud c: sales tax on the purchase amount d: the cost of cash used e: the cost of credit cards f: both credit card fraud and cost of cash\nRationales: A restaurant offered to pay for your meal with a credit card. In order to process a credit card, credit card companies receive a fee from your bank for accepting the payment. The fee is normally a small percentage of the payment. \n-The restaurant would pay for the meal on your behalf and then ask you to pay the bill using your credit card.\n-Your bank charges a processing fee for accepting the transaction.\n-Your bank would take a small percentage of this amount and transfer the rest to the restaurant.\n-If the meal is too expensive to pay via a credit card, you can always request the restaurant to settle the bill using cash instead", "answer": "D: carpenter's shop"}

For each task, there are provided a set of choices. Some of them do not match with the task. The students need to determine whether each choice matches the question. They should take into account all the information that can help them, such as the learning environment, the context of the task wording, and the task instruction. When the student thinks that there is an alternative to the original choice, the student can click 'A: incorrect' option to notify the teacher that this option can not be interpreted correctly.

Choices:  B: remove charges C: take out a loan D: deposit a check E: pay off a debt\nRationales: The correct answer, according to the context, should describe the activity which is the opposite of the action of taking a loan out.\nTo determine the possible meanings of the word \"fix\", we must define what \"fix\" means on an action level.\nOn the action level, the word \"fix\" means to fix the wrong action that is the action that was taken which led to the financial difficulty. The word \"fix\" can not mean to fix the physical machine. So the word means to fix the action instead.\nThough all the options mean \"to fix\" as an action, they do not mean the same thing to fix.\nSo we can rule out the options \"D\" and \"E\", which do not fit in the same logic to fix.\nThe option \"C\" does not fit the context of fixing the wrong action, nor is it logical to take a loan to fix the wrong action.\nThis leave us with the option \"B\" the only option which both fits in our context and is logical to mean \"fixing\" according to the meaning of \"fix\".\nAnswer: B: remove charges\n\nInput: Which of these can you find before the game?

We are asked to select the correct choice.\n\n### Key:\n1. The key is to get the point that all items in a choice are not related to other items in that same choice.\n2. We need to carefully consider each choice and the type of items in it.\n3. For example, you can compare every option to the correct answer, since then they would not be related to their respective items.\n4. One way to do it is to select an item from one of the choices and compare it with another item in the same choice and ask \"could I have selected this item as the correct answer?\".\n5. This should only be done if the correct answer has not been identified, or is still unknown. 6. Another thing to do would be to select an item from the choice that is not related to the correct answer and ask \"could I still have selected this item as my response even if it was wrong?\"\n7. If the answer to this is yes, then the item being questioned can be eliminated. \n8. So, the following rules should be followed to determine choices:\n9.

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: Why should they do the math? Choices:  Why should you do the math? A: B: C: D: E:\nRationales:1. First, notice that the question asks us why someone should do the math and not why they should or should not.\n2. The use of a pronoun in the sentence is an important clue as to what type of task or item is being asked for. A choice that involves a pronoun typically refers to people whereas a choice that does not involve a pronoun usually refers to a concept or thing.\n3. In this case, the question begins with a pronoun ('should') indicating it is talking about people and the possible reasons they should do a task. Since it is a pronoun, we can only conclude it is referring to people as we have no other choice options available.\n4. With this in mind, the first choice A, B, C, and D, refer to why you should do math. These options can be eliminated as they are not referring to a person doing math.\n5. E, in the sentence, is the correct answer because it asks why someone should do math. Additionally, the correct placement of the pronoun in front of'math' indicates it should ask why someone (the pronoun) should do math to a person (the pronoun). \nAnswer: E: why someone should do math\n\nInput: When is someone supposed to know the answer is not right? Choices:  They should know after they start to write. They should know before they start to write.  They should know after thinking. They should know before thinking.\nRationales: First, notice that the questions asks 'when' and not 'why', as it is focused on a timing choice rather than the reasoning or result.\n2. Next, it focuses on whether the choice is related to when a person starts to write, as indicated by the question's use of'should they know'.\n3. Since the options are related to timing and choice A starts to write and choice E starts thinking, this implies choice B would be the best answer since it involves an action between those two, namely deciding.\n4. Additionally, it is unlikely that choice B would involve writing as the beginning of writing is clearly outside of a person's control at that stage.

Choices:  X: alone, Y: classroom, Z: home, B: grocery store, C: movie theater, D: library\nRationales: Start by analyzing each answer and defining them.\n\nX, alone, means by themselves without anyone.\n\nY, classroom, means they are in an educational place of learning for the purpose of a class or course.\n\nZ, home, means that they are in the place of residence that they live in with their family.\n\nB, grocery store, means the retail space that sells food and everyday necessities.\n\nC, movie theater, means an establishment that shows movies or films.\n\nD, library, means a public place that specializes in providing books and related educational materials such as movies, magazines, music and computers connected to the internet. \n\nIt's clear Z, X, and B are unrelated to a classroom environment and likely are not as relevant to the intended situation. \n\nConsider X as it can mean the child should go alone to feel older. \n\nThen consider B as it appears to mean the child should go to a grocery store by themselves, and the grocery store could certainly mean an individual buys more than they can carry by themselves. \n\nSo, the most fitting choice after analyzing each one and defining the context is B.  \nAnswer: B: grocery", "answer": "E: drawer"}

Choices: \nA: traveling B: sleeping C: shopping D: exercising E: driving\nRationales:\n1. The word stroll is commonly synonymous with the word walk, thus the question is referring to the location where the woman is currently walking.\n2. The question is trying to get more specific about the activity of the woman while she is walking.\n3. Each given option deals with actions that are incompatible with the act of walking.\n4. None of those choices involve walking, so none of them are related to the activity of 'walking'.\n5. Based on this, the option that best describes the activity relates to the walking is 'exercising'.\n6. In addition, based on the given clue of the woman walking, it is more likely that she is walking alone than with others.\n7. Thus it is unlikely that she would be driving a car or shopping at a store. \n8. The activity of exercising while walking is also more frequent for someone who is trying to take a 'tour' or hike the area. \n9.

Choices A: grocery C: butcher B: hardware store E: vegetables D: produce\nRationales: (1) First, let's start by analyzing each option to get a sense of what it actually is. \n(2) The given options are: grocery, butcher, hardware store, vegetables, and produce.\n(3) Grocery and butcher options are both places where food is sold, but they are not a place that'sells' baking supplies.\n(4) Likewise, 'hardware store' or'vegetables' or 'produce' may be areas where you could find baking supplies, but they are not the type of places that sell them.\n(5) Based on the analysis, it seems that the answer could be D: produce.\n\n(6) In a produce store, there are usually places where you can find baking supplies such as flour or sugar.\n(7) It is reasonable to infer that this is most likely the answer, but let's verify by rationally evaluating all the options.\n\n(8) Now, let's analyze option E: this one doesn't seem unreasonable as the name 'butcher' implies the selling of meat, so the answer could be E, which gives us a different type of seller.\n\n(9) If we're looking for food-related options, option A 'grocery' may be a possible answer. Groceries are available to purchase, but are often found in larger stores that are not specifically dedicated to baked goods. Therefore, the option E doesn't actually fit given the requirements.\n\n(10) On the other hand, option D could be an accurate answer. Produce stores are more focused and dedicated to selling fruits and vegetables, and they often sell grains, nuts, and other ingredients used for baking.\n\n(11) Hence, answer C is correct.\n\nAnswer: C: produce\n\nInput: As one is reading a magazine, what may be read?

The given options consist of other purchases or items that may be linked with wearing the same color but may not be related to the color of hair as suggested by question.\n3.

{"text": "physical record is 'destroy'.\nAnswer: C. (delete/erase/destroy)\n\nInput: Was a spider able to escape from the snake? Choices:  Yes : No : C : B : A :\nRationales: The question asks if a spider is able to escape from a snake, so we can infer that if a spider actually succeeded in escaping, the answer would be yes.\n1. If the spider is successful then the answer could never be no, as it will have to be success.\n2. For the options that begin with a B or a C (as well as the answer option A), the spider is already surrounded by the snake's body or jaws. This renders the spider unable to escape.\n3. If the spider hasn't been successful then they're still in danger of being eaten by the snake. This doesn't matter if it was able to be outside as the danger is already there.\n4. For the answer choices that begin with a C, the danger of being eaten can still exist if the spider got outside or not.\n5. The answer will be no if the spider was not able to get outside, even if they are still surviving.\n6. Therefore the only true answer is B.\nAnswer: B. (success was not met)\n\nInput: The man's clothes were torn, so were they clean? Choices:  No : Yes : B : C : D :\nRationales:\"The man's clothes were not torn, so they were not clean\" could be the logical conclusion. \n\nHowever, \"The man's clothes are clean, so they were not torn\" is more logical, because the action of \"not torn\" occurred after cleanliness.\n1. Considering that the man was wearing clean clothes but his clothes were torn, the man must have torn his clothes, so the correct answer is B.\n\nInput: The horse, she ate, what is it? Choices:  apple : peanut : pumpkin : orange :\nRationales\"The horse, she ate\" is the logical conclusion for this inference question, because the word \"she\" and \"eat\" cannot be found together before the words \"the horse\".\n\n\"The horse didn't eat anything, so what did she eat", "answer": "B: sporting event"}

D: points E: experience\nRationales: The question asks about things that have a high score in games which can be obtained for free. To determine possible answers and eliminations, we first start with examining the characteristics of each. \n\nCash is definitely not a free item or something you have to earn. Cash is a currency that has no game score.\n\nThe word 'diamonds' is more ambiguous. It could refer to diamond cards or other in-game items, but it could also mean diamonds in actual life. In the context of gamers, diamonds refer to in-game currency which can be obtained after reaching a certain level, buying it with real money, or using in-game points and rewards.\n\nGold does not have any in-game purchases associated with it. It's likely the question is asking about the score in a game you obtain by having points or experience.\n\nExperience is definitely not available for free. Experience is something that you must learn by doing. In most games, experience is a reward for completing tasks or goals.\n\nTherefore, the best answer which fits with free and experience is A: 'points'.\nAnswer: A: points\n\nInput: When using a cellphone, you must take care of the batteries? Choices:  D: battery E: charger\nRationales: Analysis: There are multiple phrases and items in the question.\n\nBattery is the correct answer, but the question's phrasing is poor and vague. It may refer to the battery or the charge level. \n\nFor example, \"you have to take care of the batter\" could mean a) you have to physically take the battery out and put it back in, b) you have to be mindful of how much battery charge there is. Therefore, the answer should not have been chosen based on the poorly phrased question and its implications.\nAnswer: D, 'battery'\n\nInput: You want to know the purpose of this task, where will the people go?

The only acceptable choice is B: any, which accurately reflects the choice of 'a lot' more.\nAnswer: B. Any\n\nInput: How can you stop babies from making so much Noise? Choices: 2. A: keep them inside B: feed them vegetables C: take them out D: stop them crying E: try sleeping\nRationales: The question asks about the way to stop babies from crying, a frequent or habitual action.\n2. An analysis of the given answers show that these are all ways in which people deal with babies' or toddlers' crying.\n3. Thus, the most suitable choice is C, 'take them out'.\nAnswer: C. Take them out\n\nInput: How much of us can't be seen if we have the eyes open? Choices: A: 10% B: 70% C: 1% D: 69% E: 80%\nRationales: Starting this question, we need to first consider that the choices given are percentages of a group, in terms of numbers.\n2. We can eliminate D, as it is not feasible for a group to be 69% or below the total of 100% of that group. Moreover, choice B does not seem to make sense as while 100% is feasible, it would mean that 90% of the group is'seen'.\n3. Similarly, choice E does not fit with the requirement. \n4. Thus, the answer will either be A or C.\nIf you consider the group to be 'us', with A being 10%, then C, which is 1%, makes sense as it's the smallest among the four options.", "answer": "E: erections"}
{"text": "record would be either'rewrite' or 'erase'.\n7. Option 'erase' is the perfect match as this can be understood as the act of trying to forget or hide some element from the past while'rewrite history' could potentially refer to the act of altering a record to change history, which is a separate action.\n8. Therefore the answer would be D: Play Music.\nAnswer: D : play\n\nInput: What are people trying to do, if they are eating dinner and making sure everyone's food is warm? Choices: \nA: order more dinner B: cook for themselves C: give out of homework D: get the house warm E: share food with other people\nRationales: Each of the choices is specific to a different scenario.\n\n1. We know that 'ordering more dinner' refers to something we don't want at all! This is not what we are doing at this scenario.\n2. 'Cooking for oneself' may still be done if we are trying to make sure everyone's food in warmer, but warming food is not the intended purpose of the action.\n3. 'Giving homework' may refer to the act of giving extra tasks to family members for example. But again, there is no connection between giving homework and warming food for the specific actions we are doing.\n4. So, we can reject 'giving homework'. Similarly, 'getting the house warm' seems like it may be a relevant action if the family is having dinner together at home. But, we know we are making sure everyone's dinner is warm as well. Clearly, this cannot lead to that action.\n5. Lastly,'sharing food with other people' seems to refer to the act of bringing food from home to someone else, so it may seem relevant if someone is trying to make sure everyone in the family is warm. However, this is not what the scenario dictates. We are doing multiple actions, not one action that may be relevant for others later.\n6. This means that 'D' will be the best answer.\nAnswer: A : order more dinner\n\nInput: Do people use money as energy?

Choices:  B: bicycle A: office C: car D: garden\nRationales: The question refers to a scenario where someone is looking for a pen that is missing.\n2. From the five possible alternatives, there are only two options for which the description 'looking for a pen' could fit.\n3. As per the question, the person could either be in 'A: office' or 'D: garden'.\n4. However, 'B: bicycle' is not possible since a bicycle doesn't hold or even contain pens.\n5. Next we have 'C: car' which is not relevant, since it's unlikely a person would be looking for a pen in their car.\n6. This narrows the choices to 'A: office' and 'D: garden'. However, in which of these two locations could a person look for a pen?\n7. Generally, if someone is in an office they could look at their desk, and if they are in a garden or a yard they could look in their purse (or other accessory that may have pens.)\n8. This means that among alternative 'A: office' provides the only logical and plausible answer.\nAnswer: A, B: office", "answer": "A: movies"}

If you are in the dress area you wouldn't have shoes.\n2. If you are in a dress area you wouldn' t be able to see yourself in a mirror.\n3. The register is where you pay to buy clothes.\n4. The person would be dressed already, so they wouldn't try on new clothing.\n5. If they were in the dress area, they wouldn't be in the check out.\n6.

B: wood 3. C: windows 4. D: metal E: cement\nRationales: The question does not mention the type of lake, for example, fresh, salt, or sea water lake, so it would be best to eliminate options that might be specific to a given type of lake.\n\nThe question asks about something on the ship (not in the ship), so this rules out options 1. and 2. \n\nAlso, options 3. and 4. mention windows, so that narrows down the options. \n\nThe final option, A. people, is the best choice because it is more likely to be visible in a ship on a lake than the other options.\n\nAnswer: A: people\n\nInput: In a hospital, what would you typically find in the intensive care unit?

Choices: A: metal B: glass C: hemp  D: paper  E: cotton\nRationales 1. Start by first, eliminating the choices which are clearly irrelevant or do not fit the criteria of the problem.\n2. By the nature of the question, using plastic straw is a choice that an organization could choose to make to cut down on plastic.\n3. The straws can be made from different materials, and we need an answer from an option related to a common material.\n4. Option A: Metal straws: These are available  but would not be the best answer choice because this can cause issues with cleaning, taste, and temperature.\n5. Option B: Glass straws. While these were at some point in popularity, but these straws break way too easily.\n6. Option C: Hemp straw: this can be made from hemp although it is not the most common straw for dining.\n7. Option D: Paper straw: These straws used to be commonly available in the past but have fallen out of favor due to the environmental impact, so they would also not be a suitable answer choice.\n8. Option E. Cotton straws: These straws have a more limited use as they are mainly used to make ice cream sodas but can be effective if utilized in the right circumstances. \n9.

Choices:  M: touch B: writing C: speech D: drawing E: gesture\nRationales: This question could use a slight rephrasing for better clarity. So, let's briefly review each of the given options.\n1. 'Touch' doesn't mean the same thing as using hands, so it wouldn't be the right answer.\n2.'writing' doesn't use the body like communicating through'speech' as this involves the use of lips, so that's not the answer either.\n3. 'Drawing' is also not a kind of communication that requires the use of hands, just hands and a paper or canvas.\n4. Similarly,'speech' is a much more general type of communication that incorporates the use of hands to sign language, but also things like writing, so it doesn't answer the question either.\n5.

Yes, the doctor generally stores medications in their drawers at their office, but the inhaler is not a medication. An inhaler is an item, like a cup, a pencil case, or a car.

Choices:  a: study b: take classes c: get a degree d: take a break e: quit job\nRationales: Consider each of the given options.\n\n1. Study. While it may seem that there is a relationship between studying and getting a better job, this is not necessarily the best answer because there could be other things required for getting a better job.\n\n2. Take classes. Similar to studying, taking classes also does not fully imply that better job is achievable.\n\n3. Get a degree. While a degree is considered critical for some jobs, it doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee that you can get a better job.\n4. Take a break.\nA break is a vacation or short trip away. It is usually not a strategy for getting a better job, although it may have a positive effect in terms of stress relief.\n5. Quit job.\nQuitting a job does not necessarily improve your job. Even if you quit, there is still no guarantee that you can get into a better job.\n6. The most suitable answer is \"a,\" which means: \"Study. The best strategy for getting a better/more satisfactory job is to study for a higher degree.\nAnswer: a: study\n\nInput: What did she take away from her breakup? Choices: 1. \"Her pride.\" 2. \"Her dignity.\" 3. \"Her pride.\"\n\n4. \"His car.\"  \nRationales: From the dialogue, we see that this item is a material object she received from her ex-boyfriend. This is the only type of item we see in the question.\n\nTherefore, we know that at most, there are only two items in the question.\nBut, one of these items cannot be \"her pride\" as she already mentioned this item in her earlier reaction to her breakup earlier in the dialogue already.\n\nSimilarly, \"her dignity\" cannot be the correct answer because she also describes how she is feeling as part of her reaction to the breakup earlier in the conversation.\nTherefore, it is impossible that \"her pride\" can describe her feelings about the breakup and it is the only answer left.\nThe answer is A: \"Her pride.\u201d", "answer": "E: pantry"}

A: accident B: collision C: accident D: collision E: collision\n Rationales: 1: Here the question specifies the reason behind why someone swerved. Now we'll look at the provided answers to see if any of them correctly identifies it based on the scenario.\n2: It's evident that the collision was the source of an accident.\n3: However, an accident is itself a type of collision. And so the options 'accident' and 'collision' can be eliminated. \n\n4: However, for 'accident', it can further be seen that the collision was the cause of the accident.\n\n5: So the correct choice is B: collision because it is the most explicit way to describe the source of why someone swerved in the scenario.\nInput: The woman bought a mop not her, what did she want? Choices: A: cleaner B: better C: cheaper D: softer E: stronger F: lighter\nRationales: The question consists of an item and then a 'that'.\n1. We have to determine what item the 'that' refers to based on the scenario provided and the options.\n2. The question asks, \"The woman bought a mop, what did she want?\" \n3. One of the options may not seem out of context, namely 'cleaner', 'better', 'cheaper' and'softer'.\n4. These options are associated with attributes mops can have, making it reasonable to think they might be related to the 'that'.  \n\n5. However, it is important to note that they are not the same as an 'end', the desired outcome they want to achieve. \n\n6. Therefore, these attributes can't be the answer to what 'that' refers to, they only indicate a characteristic a mop might have. \n\n7. Consider'stronger' and 'lighter'. These are physical characteristics that a mop may have, but they're not what a person would desire to get out of a mop as they are intrinsic characteristics.\n\n8. 'Faster' indicates a speed or effectiveness a mop is able to clean which may be what the customer's goal was", "answer": "E: heat up"}

Choices:  C: true facts A: false facts B: fictitious facts C: true statements D: false statements E: fictitious statements\nRationales: The question is asking what would likely happen if something comes as a surprise.\n1. Considering the set of provided answers:\n2. C: If something comes as a surprise, it's probably not true.\n3. True facts, fictitious facts, true statements, false statements, and fictitious statements are all unrelated to the surprise condition.\n4. This limits the choices to: A: false facts and B: fictitious statements.\n5. Facts and statements provide information. 'if X comes as a surprise, Y is more likely'.\n6. False facts would be just as likely as true facts.\n7. Fictitious statements are not associated with surprise.\n8. Thus, B should be selected.\nAnswer: B. B will be true given the surprise condition.\n\nInput: They played soccer outside what kind of field? Choices:  D: a playground  A: a pitch C: a field E: stadium\nRationales: A soccer game is played on a field, which can be a pitch, a playground, a stadium, or a field depending on the venue.\nThe provided alternatives are:\n  - D: pitch.\n  - E: stadium.\n  - C: field.\n  - A: playground.\n  - B: None of the answers are correct. \n  - B: the question and choices are incorrect or they are ambiguous.\n  - Avoid: They played soccer, so they probably played on an outdoor soccer-related playing field.\n  - B is the most general as it does not apply to any of the specific choices.\nAnswer: B - None of the above\n\nInput: Should they try to do an action with a machine they don't know how to?

Choices: \nA: absolutely not B: yes C: in that case D: maybe E: possibly \nRationales: There are 11 options available given to us - there would be a few that may be wrong. \n1. First, it would be foolish to answer \u2018absolutely not\u2019 if the train departs and you are the person waiting for the next line which would lead you to travel by taxi.\n2. Therefore, option A can be eliminated from the answer possibilities of train departure.\n3. The next wrong answer could be D and E. The options of going to the next line means you have to come back if the train is delayed.\n4. And, if we make a choice of going to the next city which is the only option that the train goes to, the destination is the reason that the person is in this city in the first place. So, this can be eliminated. \n5. C can also be ruled out since the departure of the train has already been delayed and the time left to travel to the next city won\u2019t fit in.\n6. Option B is correct. If trains always wait the time they told the passengers, then people wouldn\u2019t ask to delay the trains.\nAnswer: B' yes'\n\nInput: The man is playing the music, how long does he play the song? Choices: \t\nA: 4 years B: 4 hours C: 4 seconds D: 6 months E: 16 weeks \nRationales : 1. First, we must identify what song is being played. It doesn\u2019t say the music that he is listening to.\n2. Also, it doesn\u2019t say he will be playing the song until the 4 hours.\n3. There is a lot of uncertainty to this question and how we may interpret this. This isn\u2019t specified.\n4. It says \u2018song\u2019 which may not have to be a song that has any lyrics. Therefore, the man can choose to sing a song or simply play an instrument or a tune. \n5. Hence, the songs can be different lengths but we are referring to the length of the song that the man", "answer": "E: show appreciation"}

{"text": "record is 'erasing'.\nAnswer: C, what does it mean 'The term \"dad-bod\" was used by what professionals to discredit weight loss?\nRationales:\n1. The term 'dad-bod' refers to a person that looks more like someone with extra weight instead of a ripped person. \n2. In the context of the question it refers to a male body type with some extra weight so we should be considering the options as they relate to the contextual meaning of the term.\n3. The term 'dietitian' doesn't have any related meaning to dad-bod and is irrelevant.\n4. Similar is the case for 'expert on body image' which doesn't have any relation.\n5. It also doesn't make any sense for the term as a female doctor.\n6. The final options: medical professionals, physicians, and pediatricians are professionals in health care to focus on body image so they seem most logical.\n7. In this context'medical professionals' is the closest description to the term.\n\nInput: Which of these was worn during the 1990s? Choices: \n\nA: Trench coat B: Polo shirt \n\nC: Long skirt D: T-shirt E: Cap\n\nRationales: Considering the context of the word 'which' at the start of the question statement 'Which of these' we can discard C: long skirt as it is implied that atleast one of the two options is worn in the 90s and the contextual context in this set is clearly referring to just the top 2 options so we can exclude it from the options. \n\nThe question refers to either a 'trench coat or a polo shirt', which is why option E is incorrect as it describes a 'cap' which cannot be compared to them from the context given and it is a 3rd choice so that is not acceptable. Now lets consider options B and D and pick one of the two as the correct answer as the question is a comparison between'shirt' and 'coat' and not other 2 options. \n\nA lot of people wear trenchcoats in the winter which is why people assume people wear trenchcoat but we are asked not if people wore", "answer": "E: plantation"}

The question is asking us to understand what item a person is expected to have in order to avoid spitting water at them.\n2. Consider each of the options and make sure we are making the most appropriate selection.\n3. The person needs an item capable of catching the water.\n4. A cup and sack may be useful for catching water but neither is the best option.\n5. Water is spat out at the mouth, or in some cases, the eyes, so we need an item that fits with these locations.\n6. A shirt is a garment that covers the mouth and neck and could catch water sprayed at close range. Likewise, B: a glass, catches water spat in or near the eyes.\n7. Thus, the correct answer is B: a glass.\nAnswer: B. 'Glass'\n\n[Answer](Answered)\n[Help](Hints)\n\nInput: What are two things that a person can have and get them? Choices:  B: chips and sandwiches A: potato and water B: potato and water C: chips and sandwhiches D: chips and water E: chips and sandwithces D: chips and sandwitches\nRationales: The question states that a person can have two things and get them. This indicates that multiple choices exist related to the options that we will select to present.\nThis means we can eliminate 'chip and sandwhich' (Choice A), 'potato and water' (Choice B), and 'potato and water as B can also mean 'basket'. In addition, C: 'basket, which is too vague.\nThe correct answer is D: chips and soda, which is not only the most obvious answer but also the only one of the given options that makes sense within the context of the question\nAnswer: D: soda.\n\nInput: The boy used a magnifying glass to put the ants in a row.

Usually, a caf\u00e9 is an informal place for socializing. A caf\u00e9 is generally not where people buy food to cook at home. This is unlikely where people buy food for an outdoor social cookout. Therefore, the choice \"caf\u00e9\" is not relevant to the present context.\n\nStep Five (B): A restaurant is a more formal business setup for dining. It is not the \"place\" referred to by the question, because the question specifically mentions \"people are buying food for a cookout in the caf\u00e9\".\n\nStep Six (B): A supermarket is a big specialized shop where you buy groceries. It can serve as a 'place' where people buy food to make it but it is not the 'place' referred to by the question.\n\nTherefore, the choice \"restaurant\" and \"supermarket\" does not apply, so", "answer": "C: three feet"}

The provided alternatives are: 1. She was pregnant, 2. her body, 3. her age, 4. her gender, 5. her race.\n\nStep 1: Analyse The Qualities Of The provided alternatives (see table below)\n\nStep 2 : From the table we can see that : \n\nStep 3 : None of the given alternatives qualifies her to be a woman, as there is no information on her being pregnant or holding a baby, thus this eliminates Option#1. Likewise, the information given says \"she can be a woman\" but there is no direct mention of her having a body that can be used to identify her as a woman, hence we can eliminate Option#2. \n\nStep2: There is no mention of her being pregnant, nor does the question say that she is pregnant, like she is with a baby in her lap hence we must rule out Option #2.  Same goes for Option #3 (Her age)\n\nStep 3 Step 4: So by elimination, we are left with Option #4 (her gender) and Option #5 (her race ) \n\nStep 5 : The question says \"how can she be a woman \" this implies that someone who can identify her as a woman exists, \"she\" is the subject of the question, She can be identified by both, her gender and her race. \n\nStep6: Therefore, \" Her Gender cannot by itself uniquely identify her as a woman in the absence of her race \"\n\nStep 27: So, this eliminates Option #4 (her-gender ) from the given options leaving us with Option#5 (her-race). \n\nStep 8 : Because her Gender and Race alone cannot identify her as a woman without her body it is impossible for her to be a woman. \n\nStep-9: But her body can identify her to be a", "answer": "C: care for children"}

Choices: 1: Show up late, 2: Can't come, 3: Arrive early, 4: Post pone, 5: Change outfit\nRationales: To answer this question correctly, we have to think about the party and the relationship in regards to it.\nWe start by ruling out choice 2, 'Can't come', which seems to be the complete opposite of going to the party.\nThen, we discard choice 3, 'Arrive early', because going to a party early would be against the usual timing of attending such events.\nWe then notice that choice 4, 'Postpone', might be the answer. After all, it requires a commitment if it says 'the Party' and it seems to imply an alternate or different party.\nIn the end, we notice that the correct choice is 5, 'Change outfit'. This answer seems to suggest that we couldn't make it because of the outfit we wore earlier. This is a simple and reasonable reply.\nAnswer: C: Change outfit\n\nInput: He made the mistake, what did he do?

From what we know so far, the options should be divisible by 5. Let's explore them one by one:\n    1. Option A is 15 x 200. This seems fairly divisible by 5, however, there is a decimal after 200, so this doesn't add up.\n    2. Option B is 5 x 10 x 20 x 5.

D: via a computer 5. E: all of the above\nRationales: First, let us look through each choice and try to understand them. \n1. Remotely would require that the car has a remote control. However, we can infer that a car can drive without any remote control.\n2. A car without an owner could also drive. Thus, it cannot be the correct answer.\n3. Auto-pilot is a software system used in planes and is used to pilot aircraft without pilots. However, we were asked about 'car' not plane. The system doesn't control the drive of the car itself. There are a few devices that are installed on cars with GPS systems so that they can drive automatically. But, those were just 'part' of the car and not the entire one.\n4. A car cannot drive via a computer. We can infer that a car needs a driver, or at least human presence, to drive. However, we see that there is a computer in the car, but it is not used for driving the car.\n5. Finally, if 'all of the above' as an option then we know we can eliminate all those answers that contain only one concept.

Choices: 1: sturdy shoe 2: good fashion 3: soft fabric 4: durability, 5: leather, 6: hard sole\nRationales: What is the main reason someone wears shoes? The question could be interpreted in various ways but in the first paragraph of the question we see that shoes are worn to make walking or running easier. \nAnalyzing the options available to us:\n7. We have to examine each of the alternatives given in the choices. \n8. We see that a sturdy shoe is not designed to make walking easier.  \n9. Instead, these types of shoes are designed for activities like hiking, where the wearer needs more support and comfort. \n10. So, sturdy shoes would not be the correct choice. \n11. We can also eliminate the fashion option: clothes are not made to make walking easier; they're made to look better.  \n12. This brings us to the soft fabric option. Soft fabric shoes are often designed for walking or running.  \n13. This means that soft fabric shoes could be made to make walking easier. \n14. Next, we will consider durability. This option describes shoes that are made to last longer and are therefore not designed to make walking easy. \n15. Finally, in leather and hard sole shoes, we have a description of how they are designed to make walking easier, so those are the correct answers. \nAfter analysis, we can determine that answers 1, 4, and 6 are incorrect. We can see that 2, 3, and 5 are right and therefore the best answer is 2, 3.\nAnswer: 2: good fashion, 3: soft fabric\n\nInput: If you could pick two from the given food and two from the picture what should you not pick.

Choices:  B: parking lot C: train station D: service station E: bus stop\nRationales: Let's begin by breaking down the provided choices. \n\nThere are several different types of stations or stops in the context of public transit. Let's examine each one to determine the best fit.\n\n1. \"Bus stop\": It is possible to get on or off at a bus stop but there are no facilities for buying or keeping things. Therefore, the answer will be C.\n2. \"Train station\": Similar to bus stations, train stations allow passengers to get on and off the trains and store items at the station. But since they also have facilities to purchase tickets and other services, they are better fits than C and D.\n3. \"Parking lot\": Parking lots are generally associated with vehicles and are not connected with public transport, therefore the answer will be B.\n4. \"Service station\": A service station is a type of fuel and repair shop. If the context of this question requires us to consider a place that is used by people who don't have their vehicle, then this will not be a viable option.\n5. And lastly, \"D station\" is a gas station. However, this is not typically a place that someone can walk around in. \n6. Therefore, if the context requires us to consider a 'place that people can walk around in' and they don't have their own vehicle at the time, then the answer will be B (parking lot).\nAnswer: B: parking lot\n\nInput: For cooking, what should you cook a dish in? Choices:  C: stove D: skillet E: gas grill F: barbeque \n\nRationales: Options C and D both need to be cooked on a stove or they won't work.\n\nThe rest have to be cooked outside like a barbeque.\n\nWe can eliminate option B because it doesn't have to be cooked on an outside surface. The answer will be different.\n\nAnswer: C, Stove \n\nInput: The group decided to", "answer": "C: regular"}
{"text": "record is D: play music, as it could be interpreted as an association with history as this is the case for many classical albums.\n7. However, the question asks which option is the best match for the purpose of history; this excludes 'play music' as it is unrelated in terms of association to history.\n8. So, the best choice is D, play music.\nAnswer: B, play music\n\nInput: They have a pink bag, this could be on what? Choices:  a) A: toiletries b) B: dress c) C: lunch d) D: grocery e) E: gym \nRationales: Since the answer begins with the phrasing 'they have a pink bag', the focus should be on words that go together as a unit that describe its purpose.\n\nThere are two ways to consider this option, first from the perspective of what they can have if they hold a pink bag. This is relevant especially if pink is an implicit characteristic of the bag.\n\nIn general, a pink bag is used to hold many types of items, such as toiletries, gym, and dress. The choice that is most relevant is 'dress' as the phrase 'they have a pouch', which explicitly implies the subject had some items to carry around. It may be a small, yet important difference.\n\nThe second way involves understanding the phrase 'their pink bag' and figuring out the bag they are referring to. \n\nToiletries, lunch, and gym are not associated with the phrase. Similarly, 'their pink tote' can be associated with 'they have a pearl-white bag'. But we don't usually describe a bag with a pink color in this way.\n\nThe phrase sounds more natural with 'their purple bag' or 'their red suitcase'. Both of which are relevant to the grocery choice.\n\nThus, the most fitting answer is E, grocery.\n\nAnswer: E, grocery\n\nInput: What do you do with a ball?

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: D: erase\n\nInput: What can you do to be a more understanding person? Choices:  C: meditate B: exercise D: read books E: be in contact with friends\nRationales: Based on the given question, it can be concluded that the correct answer would be a choice that would help someone become more understanding or sympathetic.\n\n1. To better understand the options, these choices may need to be examined in greater detail.\n\n2. 'Meditate' could help one become more understanding, but it is not directly related to that action in any way.\n\n3. 'Exercise' could potentially make one more empathetic in some aspect but this is not the primary or most direct way to accomplish this goal.\n\n4. 'Read books' while related to knowledge, are more focused on expanding your general knowledge or learning, rather than becoming more sympathetic.\n\n5. 'Be in contact with friends' is not the most specific or effective option as it would be more to make contact, not necessarily be understanding or sympathetic. \n\n6. Therefore, it is sensible to determine the most obvious and direct way to increase one's sympathy or understanding. \n\n7. This is 'be in contact with friends'.\n\nAnswer: C: meditate\n\nInput: The boy is rushing what they should write? Choices:  B: a story C: a poem D: an essay E: a review\nRationales: We have to answer the question by identifying the reason the boy is rushing. This implies that it is not necessary to identify the contents of whatever the boy is writing. \n\n1. 'A story', 'a poem', and 'a review' are all types of writing you can write to complete at a more leisurely pace.\n\n2. On the other hand, the option 'an essay' is most associated with completing one with haste.\n\n3. Therefore, the best answer is 'B: a story'.\n\nAnswer: B: a story\n\nInput: If the man is trying to get away what to do?

Choices:  I: scolded II: pet dog III: called off dog IV: calmed dog V: attacked owner Choices:  A : I and III B : I and IV C: I and V D: II and III E: II and IV\nRationales: Analysis: 1. The text presents a description of an interaction between a dog and the people it meets. From the context it is inferred that the dog barked aggresively.\n2. The question requires knowledge regarding the actions of these individuals in response to the dog's action.\n3. Actions 1 and 2 are done by the owner, actions 3 and 5 are done by the dog after being ordered by the owner.\n4. Actions 4 and 5 are not directly relatable to barking but can occur after they occur.\n5. From that information, possible actions of both the dog owner and dog can be considered.\n6. Possible choices that are not relevant based on this information are not considered further.\n\nPossible options to be considered:\n\nI. Scolded / Pet dog / Called off dog / Calmed dog / Attack dog\nII. Calmed dog / Scolded / Called off dog\n\nEliminations:\n\nAction / Reason (not applicable)\n\nScolded Dog / Scold dog\nPet dog / Dog bite\nCalled off dog / Dog bark\nCalmed dog (action) / Calmed Dog\nAttacked dog (action) / Dog attack owner\nConclusion: \n\nIn conclusion, the most likely answer is:\n  * I + II: Owner scolded dog, then owner pet dog, then owner called off dog and scolded it again.\n\nAnswer: A : I and III\n\nInput: What can you use if you want not to make mistakes?

{"text": "record is to delete or erase records from history.\nAnswer: D. erase\n\nInput: You need help how many? Choices:  a: one b: two C: three D: more\nRationales: Option A is one as you need help, so it is in the subjective. \nOption B is two as you need help and also need to help yourself and therefore it is in the subject or predicate. \nOption C is three as you need help and help yourself and then need to help help yourself and therefore it has three verbs and is in the subordinate. \nOption D is more than two because you need help and help and help yourself, but it does not have four verbs, so it not in the subordinate because it is more than two. \nThe next is to understand what is predicate and what is subject: we can say that in English words always are in a subjective or predicate in the subject or predicate in the sentence. So, the subjective is either the predicate or the predicate or the predicate and so on. So we can say that A: one is the predicate in the sentence, B: two is the predicate in the predicate or predicate or predicate in the predicate and so on, C: three is the predicate in the subjective D: more is the predicate in the subordinate. And the subject is B and C and D is the predicate. So A: one is the subjective and the predicate B: two is the subjective, the predicate or the predicate, C: three is is the predicate in the predicative or the predicate and so D: more is the subject or the subject or the predicate. So the answer is correct is that B: two it's because A: one B: two C: three and D: more. \n\nInput: Who should you not put food on the shelf first?

D, phone\n7. E, brain tumor\n8. The question directly states 'for them', so the patient must be an item.\n9. With the previous information, we know it can never be B, since a heart is not considered an item. If it were an item, the correct response would have been C, which is incorrect.\n10. Similarly, D and E are incorrect due to a lack of context.\n11. Finally, out of the five options, the only option that makes sense is C, which is computer.\n\nAnswer: C.

Choices:  IA: pass EB: fail C: grade IS: master D: pass. AC DE BN: pass\nRationale: 1. The options are being presented to provide context or explanation for the student's statement.\n2. Each choice is a situation related to how the student's statement applies.\n3. From this, we first see that A and E are incorrect, because what they're saying is not related to examination or failing an exam.\n4. So the student is not bad at reading books. But it is still related to the statement, so A and E are not our final answer.\n5. Consider options B, C, D, 'how is their test going?', they are all about whether or not the student is failing.\n6. Choice B: grade is an evaluation or assignment, which is directly related to the student's statement and answer to 'how is your test going'.\n7. Choice C: IS is an adverb that could indicate success.\n8. Choice D: IS is a conjunction that is used to link different items or situations.\n9.

You may not want to miss seeing the attractions\n\nthe statement \"You can do (A: Take: A: camera (B: take a bag of food C take: sunglasses /D: weigh (E: water D: A hat) on your way to the zoo) is not incorrect.\n\n4. First let's consider the given options that may be relevant:\n\nA: Camera - As a camera can be used to take pictures, it might be a suitable choice as it may have a photographic purpose.\n\nB: Bag of Food - While not exactly necessary, carrying a little snack food like crackers and cookies can be helpful, particularly while traveling long distances, but also if you expect your visit to be a little while longer.\n\nC: Sunglasses - A classic choice for the zoo as the outdoor nature of the park has sunny rays, especially in warm summer months.\n\nD: A Hat - Wearing a hat can protect you but also give a hint as to what to expect.\n\nE: Water - As we all know drinking water is important throughout the day. While there may be no water fountains there or other water features to drink from, we all know you need water!\n\n5. While these are all potential items for taking on a trip, only one can be used to take a picture. We know the correct answer is A: Take a camera since a camera is not simply an item you can easily take but it can be used to take an actual picture to show off. This answer is preferred by most people who are going to the zoo but also are in need of taking a picture of an animal or other item of significance. In summary, the option which can best be used along with your going to the zoo is A: Take a Camera with you and that is the correct answer. \n\nAnswer: A: Take Camera\n\nInput: He was going to be in Chicago, where he", "answer": "A: tennessee"}

D: gift shop\nRationales: If an object is on a baggage carousel, it has to be in a location that is an airport. If an object is not on a baggage claim, then it is not in a location that is necessarily in an airport.\nTherefore, since a baggage claim is the location of a baggage carrel within an airport, we can eliminate A: Baggage Claim because the object is not there.\n1. Baggage claim is not a place but instead a general category of where objects may go if they are at least not at a baggage carrousel.  Baggage storage is related to luggage rather than where a luggage carousel is located.\n2. D: Gifts Shop is relevant because these are often located in airports in addition to other transportation hubs.\nTherefore, we can eliminate all but D. 1.

The question is asking a question where there are 3 main possibilities. There are ways to choose the correct answer without referring to its specific meaning, because they are all connected and the correct meaning is just the different way the same thing can be said.\n\n2. Choices A and B are related to transportation. Choice A is about what to ride while choice B states about means to pay for it. In our context, means to ride a bike means you need transportation to get to a bookstore. Thus, they cannot be the right answer.\n\n4. Choices D and E are about money as well. But, there can be other ways to pay for transportation. Moreover, in this question, if you don't have money, you can always use transportation that is already there and you don't have to buy a ticket for it, e.g. train.\n\n5. Choices C and F refer to motivation. But motivation is not essential for you to reach a bookstore. So, they cannot be the answer.\n\nThe correct answer is F because that is the only choice which specifically links to the context (knowledge of a good book - where will you be if you are looking for a book).

Choices: .7: the train stops by choice A :the train stops for you  B : the train is destroyed C :The train hits you E : the train loses money\nRationales: The problem is that person is standing in the middle of the rails and cannot get out of the way. \n1. A train cannot simply choose to stop, they must come to a stop when the brakes have been applied.\n2. The train may lose money, but that is not a consequence of running the person over.\n3. The train will only hit the person if the person cannot/does not get out of the way of the train.\n4. This means person either stops the train, is moved out of the way beforehand, or the person does not move out of the way and is hit by the train.\n5. There is no punishment or benefit to the train (only the person).\n6. Therefore the person has to get out of the way or the train will hit the person, giving us answer B: the train stops for you.\nAnswer: B : the train stops for you\n\nInput: When is a dog typically outside?

Where are dogs typically outside?\n4. All of these questions are about when is a dog typically out.\n5. So, our options can describe times at which a dog typically is outside or typically goes out.\n\nStep 2. Rule out the irrelevant options.\n\nStep 1. A, B, and C can be eliminated since they do not provide the \"when\" of a dog being outside. The only choice that answers the question about \"when\" is E\n\nStep 3.

The question asks to identify what is'seen' in the scenario of a boat taking on a 'big wave'\n2. In context, we can examine the phrase 'taking on a big wave' because it is an expression that is often related to 'taking something on'. Thus, we should see if there is an object being taken on or an object acting to take something on.\n3. It can be eliminated that D is an inaccurate option, since the question refers to a boat and not a 'boat with a motor'.\n4. 'Crashing' is also implied because taking on a big wave on its top does mean the boat would crash. But, crashing doesn't fit with the 'taking on' phrase or refer to'seeing' or 'visibility'.\n5. 'Upset' is also not suitable, because that term refers to the boat tilting or tipping which can't occur because the boat is still and a lot of water falls on top of it, not underneath it.\n6. The remaining options,'splash' and'splashing', are associated with water and its appearance, so they could fit with the question.\n7. However, considering the options that could potentially be seen,'splash' is the most suitable.\nAnswer: B Splash\n\nInput: What happens if you overindulged in milk?

Thus, there are likely to be options that fit with the action'making muffins', which are (making a plate, eating a plate, making muffins, eating muffins, eatting in a pan, and eating out of pan). Each of the options have been eliminated except for option (B), \"eat\" and option (E), \"eat out of pan\". \nOption (D), 'in the pan' isn't correct because you can't \"eat the pan\" or \"eat the muffin pan\", you can eat the food that's cooked in the pan. \nTo answer this question, we may conclude that the correct option is (A), \"you can eat muffins on a plate\". \nThe question is asking about the action of making muffins where the word \"making\" may imply they're not ready to be eaten immediately. \nThe only option that fits this context is option (B), \"you can eat the muffins\".\nAnswer: A: on plate\n\nInput: They have to make siding, what would be required?

Owner will own a restaurant, but that doesn't necessarily mean they will be in charge. \n\nIn this situation, being a chef will mean that you're responsible for every meal, which will require you to be very hands-on during the process.   \n\nAs a manager, you're responsible for overseeing the staff and will be more removed from the actual process of cooking.  \n\nAs a cook,  you can do everything yourself so you are very involved in the process, but it can also mean you are less in charge of your work and will have a hard time giving directions or corrections to other kitchen staff. \n\nA chef, manager, or cook is not 'in charge' of a restaurant.

Option D: 'disc of the record' is more correct but doesn't fully fit into the sentence as 'discs' are the primary format of a music album\n\nOption C best describes a tape of a record, with it being the disc of a record, a correct phrase.\n\nAnswer: C: disc at a record\n\nInput: Which statement is not true about the car?

We can eliminate A because it is the only one that does not talk about a tire (in this case is a well worn one) and so it should remain false.\n3. We also can eliminate B because we know that it refers to an engine and not to the fuel tank so it should always be true.\n\n4.

Choices: 1. A: a road 2. B: no road signs 3. C: puddles 4. D: high grass 5. E: a stream\nRationales:  1. The question asks which hazards one is most likely to encounter on a trail while walking.\n2. The given choices are a road, no road signs, puddles, high grass and a stream.\n3. In order to select the most likely hazard, it\u2019s necessary to identify each option and its corresponding trait.\n4. Considering the question, the trail is likely to be a place without roads or street signs.\n5. This means that any hazards could arise from the natural landscape of the area, including water sources, high grass, or deep puddles.\n6. Therefore the most likely hazards are found in \u2018high grass\u2019 and \u2018puddles\u2019.\n7. Since \u2018stream\u2019 isn\u2019t uncommon, and could also lead to possible hazards, it's appropriate to consider it as an option when evaluating the best choice.\n8. In this case, the best choice is C: puddle. \u2018Puddles\u2019 is a natural phenomenon and the area likely to have at least one.\n9. \u2018Stream\u2019 could also be a natural occurrence, but isn\u2019t as likely, so the probability is higher.\n10.

{"text": "record is \"erase\".\nAnswer: D: play music\n\n### Question\n\n1. The question asks us to determine which of the possible answers is most directly analogous to the burning of a record to eliminate something, in this case history.\n2. The available answer options are compact disc, tape and play music. It is obvious that this is in some way analogous to a physical object that can be burned, so these should be eliminated.\n\n3. Next, we can eliminate erase. It is not the right answer since it is to do with memory, not to do with music which is what we are asked about.\n\n4. So, now we have play music left (and perhaps erase as a final option, but it doesn't quite work). Playing music is to do with eliminating music, so it is the most likely answer choice.\n\n### Answer\nPlay audio", "answer": "C: large city"}

The question asks what the person might be seeing.\n2. By considering each option, we can assess which is the most likely to capture the correct answer.\n3. There are two types of common tickets that restaurants give out \u2014 one to sit inside the restaurant and another one for outside seating.\n4. Since the order of choices suggests that 'front door', 'line', and 'inside' might be linked to something different, we can rule those out.\n5. 'Outside' has a reasonable association to a ticket for outdoor seating.\n6. 'Cross': We can cross off the option 'cross' as 'inside' doesn't make sense. 'Front': We can cross off 'front' as 'line' is associated with lines, not front. 'Door': 'Front door' can be ruled out as there might be multiple doors from where the person would be outside. 'Inside': 'Front' is also related to 'inside' so we can rule that out too. 'Line': We can cross off this options also because of 'Cross'. So now we are left with the only option 'Window'.\n7. So the correct answer is 'Window' as the person was given a 'ticket' which also could be a window.\nAnswer:D: the front door\n\nInput: What did they take away when they stole the bike?

The question is asking you how one would receive a return or refund.\n\n2. To use the toaster, you put bread in it and press a button. \n3. To get it back at the store after purchasing it, you would have to return it. \n4. Therefore, the best answer is C: return.\n\nInput: How could you get the job promotion if you get to the office on time every day? Choices: Answer: B: be a friend  Rationales : 1. There is a clear question: how could you get promotion if you have good work habits (i.e. always arrive on time)?\n\n2. What comes to mind is that you would be promoted or rewarded by being a good colleague (i.e. becoming friends with colleagues). \n3. The question is not asking about qualifications or performance. \n4. The word \"job promotion\" is synonymous with being a good colleague. \n5. But getting to the office on time, every day does not guarantee that you'll get promotions or rewards. \n6. Therefore, D is not an official answer.\n\nInput: Which type of clothing could I wear?

He did not throw it away in the truck, either. \nThe man did not throw it away and then call the police as well. Therefore the answer should not be E.\nThe man did not read the letter, so he did not put it in a trash can. Similarly, he did not throw it away so he did not throw it in the truck, nor did he throw the letter away. The man did not throw the letter away and then call the policeman as well. Therefore, the answer should not be D \nThe man did throw the letter away in the trash so the answer would not be C.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: The man has taken some money when he has come into the room.

The question is about a person looking for someone to make them a desk.\n2. If the person already has experience \"in carpentry\", they likely don't need help making the desk, but may need help if they do or do not have experience.\n3. A desk is typically assembled or built, not created. These terms are used to distinguish one is building something (carpentry) or putting something together.\n\n4. As the other options are more specific examples of an assembly, this choice can be eliminated\n5. The desk the person might want to have built is not something they create themselves.\n6. Therefore the choice 'C' about whether the person is confident with building a desk can be eliminated too\n\n7. It is likely that the person is looking for someone to help them to assemble a desk.\n8. But if the person is looking for people who know how to build something, this would be better communicated by 'A' which is a more general version of the same idea as 'Yes, they have experience in 'carpentry' and 'building'.\n9.

What does impregnable mean? In this case, the question asks us to use the word impregnable in a context and determine whether it accurately suggests the use of the word.\n\n2. To analyze the question, the first important element to consider is what the word impregnate means. Let's investigate this together.\n\n3. Impregnate as a verb is used to refer to the process of making someone or something fertile or able to cause pregnancy.\n4. Impregnate is generally used in combination with female reproductive organs and not male. We can therefore exclude B: food.\n\n5. To identify whether the scenario accurately fits with impregnable, we must first determine impregnable definition.\n\n6. Let's examine the definition of impregnable again: a castle whose enclosed area is too difficult for attackers on the first try. So this is related to the ability to prevent intruders from getting in.\n\n7. In this situation, the person puts food in the water to indicate that they're going to drown the intruder. This is inaccurate use of the word. The 'enclosed' area here represents water and not castle walls.\n\n8. So, the best match for impregnable (a castle having tough castle walls that is difficult for attackers to breach) would be C: food or (D) food that represents drowned attacker.\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Answer explanation:\n\nIn order to answer the question correctly, we need to answer the three parts of the question.\n\nPart 1: Choosing the scenario\n\nFor the first part, we must pick the scenario which best suits", "answer": "E: competence"}

They would have the right answers and supportive responses because they can see, hear, speak to ghosts.\nD: parent.\nA parent of the person facing their fears would certainly be involved with the situation if it were present.\nParents can be supportive and comforting but they also give advice.

Therefore, the camera type that may have been wanted by the person who wanted to take photographs is B: regular camera.\n3.

While it is certainly a possibility that we wanted to eat from him, it could also mean that we all wanted food from him, e.g., his wife bought a panda cake at his birthday party.\n\n2. The option could also be read as 'to leave' or 'to move out'.\n\n3. This option states that we all wanted to pay. It implies that we all wanted the man to do something. But, did we, collectively, want to pay him? Payment may not be the only way to get our demands met.\n\n4. This could also be read as we all wanted him not to leave.

Choices:  (A) the product (B) the surface area (C) the time (D) the temperature (E) the height\nRationales: The given choices do not provide us much of an indication for what they are evaluating.\n1. However, we could use deductive reasoning to infer what they might be measuring here. To do that, we would need to look at how lotion is typically measured.\n2. We know that the thickness of lotion is measured in inches.\n3. This allows us to eliminate A: the product and C: the time as the size of a lotion products or the amount of time needed do not usually contribute to the thickness of lotions.\n4. It also allows us to eliminate option D: the temperature as most types of lotions do not need to be heated to be used.\n5. What's left are B: the surface area and E: the height.\n6. In this context, we know that the height is of an individual, not a lotion, and is not particularly relevant to what we're measuring.\n7. Therefore we have eliminated E: the height as a potential answer.\n8. Furthermore, the only remaining option is B: the surface area.\n9. In most cases, lotions are applied in a particular amount evenly to the surface of one's body, so that each section is evenly coated.\n10.

Choices: 1. erase 2. shade 3. fuse 4. make lines 5. rub off\nRationales: There are two aspects to a pencil: the body of the pencil & the lead in the pencil.\n\nThe body of a pencil includes the casing of the pencil, the clip of the pencil etc while the lead is made of a soft material that is used to write.\n\nThe body and lead work in conjunction to allow writing to take place.\n\nThe body holds the actual lead at its core and allows the lead to come into contact with the paper.\n\nIf that core contact is to happen then in some form or the other, the lead comes into contact with the paper which results in shading, fusing, making lines or rubbing off.\n\nNow, only rubbing off is not considered as it does not involve the lead of the pencil coming into contact any part of the paper.\n\nRubbing off means that the writing that was done was with a pencil lead. That writing can be rubbed off. If that is what is meant, the correct answer is 'rubbing off'. If rubbing off is not wanted then the lead is erased.\n\nThe body is used to make sure the lead comes into contact. The lead makes the shading, fusing and making lines.

The answer is a place where flowers are typically grown, so garden, the answer, is not in the given options.\n2. Step 2: Let's examine the remaining choices. \n\nStep Evaluate choice B, Garden. A garden is indeed a good place to see flowers, but many gardens do not boast particularly beautiful flowers. Sometimes it's better to see them in an ideal setting, like a botanical garden. \nStep 3: Let's consider choice C, mall. Some malls do have plants, but they are rarely very beautiful, as their purpose is primarily commercial rather than a place to grow plants. Likewise, malls are also not a common location people visit to find beautiful flowers as this isn't their primary purpose.\nStep 4: Consider option D, home. While home is the obvious choice for someone to find beautiful flowers, this choice doesn't fit the structure and is eliminated.\nstep 5: Next, let's evaluate E, store.

It melts\nRationales: Start by categorizing each option. Based on the available options we can categorize each into one of 2 main categories: \n\n1. Something that might happen to the plant when it is outside of certain boundaries (choice A and B)\n\n2. Something that might happen due to circumstances outside of your control (D, E).\n\nSince the plant is 'buried' in the scenario it can't be something that might occur when it is outside of a certain boundary.\n\nWhen considering D and E, it becomes apparent that something caused the plant to'shrivel'. This indicates that it might've either been burnt, frozen, or melted causing the plant to'shrink'. Choices D and E are outside of your control and thus, might've happened to the plant outside of the time limit you gave it.\n\nIn context, option B 'gets rained out' seems to be the most reasonable option to describe the plant at the end of your time limit. The only reasonable option to describe the current situation of the plant is option B, 'it gets rained out'\n\nOption B is the correct option.\n\nAnswer: B: gets rained out\n\nInput: When is it likely that you are going to meet friends for lunch?

'Erasing history' would be the answer to the question.\nAnswer: D; erase\n\nInput: Which of the following do you not need to open a book in general sense? Choices: 1. knife 2. scissors 3. books\nRationales:\n1. The first assumption to make is that the only one that is required needs to be mentioned and the others are irrelevant.\n2. If the task has the phrasing 'open a book in general sense', then it refers to the general concept of 'open book' regardless of any factors.\n3. The task means the books to 'open' refer to a 'book', not a stack of books or a textbook as the other choices imply. And it refers to the general sense to 'book' rather than a book related to a specific subject like math.\n4. 'Scissors' and 'knife' are not required to open a book in the sense of 'the general sense to book'.\n5. Furthermore, even though the general sense of a book includes the general books that are meant for reading, such as fiction, etc., and are not solely books that require math or science, these things are not necessary for opening a book in general, either.\n6. The only choice that describes a situation where a person would need a knife or scissors to open a book is 'books'.\n7. The choice that best matches as the answer to the task's requirement is therefore 'books'.\nAnswer: Books\n\nInput: What did they want for their food, chokeberry? Choices: 4. salads 5. salmon 6. wine 7. fruit 8. sushi 9. cake\nRationales: Note: The food 'chokeberry' refers to chokeberry juice in the question.\n1. The question poses two options to consider, one option requires further evaluation and analysis while the other is the most obvious answer required to complete the task.\n2. The 'chokeberry' is a type of fruit, though the choice 'wine' does not refer to a fruit and is not an appropriate answer to the question about what kind of food the person wanted, thus, this is incorrect.\n3.

Choices:  I: restaurant ii: bus iii: bank iv: hotel v: police \nRationales: This question uses a scenario where business people drop their goods at the post office and asks about their next location. To answer the question we need to identify how business people usually act after dropping their goods.\n\n\nConsider all the options given:\n\n1. 'Restaurant' \n\n    This is not an obvious choice. The word'restaurant' indicates a place that prepares and serves food and it seems unlikely that business people would have to stop at such places after dropping off their items, as that would consume time, and be somewhat unnecessary. \n\n2. 'Bus' \n\n    Again, this is a location that is not intuitive. Many post offices have nearby bus stations, but it is uncommon for business people to need to rely on public transportation to get their parcels to their destination.\n\n3. 'Bank' \n\nWe can eliminate this option because the description given in the question shows that it is a drop-off location, not a location where they can pick up their parcels.\n\n4. 'Hotel' \n\nWhile many post office facilities also contain hotels, those people who receive items there are usually referred to as 'customers' and are receiving items that are related to private matters, while business people who drop items off usually are trying to send items to a location that is related to professional duties.\n\n5. 'Police'\n\nWe can eliminate option v, which is a location where police are always present.\n\nOf the remaining options, two have relevant context: \n\n1. i: restaurant - Restaurants do not have the relevance to answer the question of this questionnaire.\n\n2. iv: hotel - Hotels, particularly fancy hotels in cities, have the relevant context required to answer the question. \n\nConsidering the possible context of the two choices, option iv: hotel is the most relevant to the question. \nAnswer: iv: hotel", "answer": "D: exchange"}

This would be a different question altogether, as the person has already stated that they are going to move the stack of books with their back.\nOption B: Yes, is the easiest and most straightforward choice, since it is the same wording as the question.\nOption C: No is the opposite of what the question is asking.\nOption D: May be, is the same wording of the question, but it comes across as too uncertain.\nOption E: Yes, is the second best choice, as it would be a smart idea to contact a doctor first, in this situation.\nAnswer: E: yes.", "answer": "B: getting bored"}

Choices:  the next 24 hours A: dinner B: shopping C: eating D: leisure E: relaxation\nRationales: The first step is to understand the prompt in its entirety - it discusses a customer who makes a large purchase which indicates they are likely planning to spend more time at the store. \n\nThe prompt does not discuss the options listed and there are no details provided in the prompt to suggest these are options one should consider.\n\nFirst, evaluate choice A: the next 24-hours. Eating large meals is likely to be considered after shopping. This makes more sense than shopping, etc. - the customer is buying a lot of food. This is also the easiest to understand and connects well with the scenario provided. Therefore, it is the most likely answer.\nAnswer: A the next 24 Hours\n\nInput: The student studies, which area is that?

While you may find quite surroundings in a library to study, you would expect taped music and radio to be playing in the Library.\n\nChoice B: Taped music - Music may be one of the things students may find helpful in a Library environment. This is plausible.\n\nChoice C: Taped voice - Taped speech recordings by authors may be recorded in the library for students to review. This is plausibe.\n\nChoice D: Taped Radio - Radio shows are broadcast in the library from time to time to draw students in for informational or entertainment, perhaps. This is plausibly.\n\nChoice E: Taped speaker - This is a valid answer, and the students may find this helpful to learn from the Library's speaker.

Choices: 1: find a part 2: go to location 3: visit a place 4: have good credit 5: lose credit\nRationales:\n\nStep 1: It is evident that the question seeks information about the 'piece of the map', i.e., the person who seeks something, the 'piece' that needs location or is looking for something.\n\nStep 2. The question is seeking the option(s) that best fits the scenario described as a 'piece of the mapping'.\n\nStep 3. It means that the choice should be the one used to describe the action taken by the \u2018person\u2019 described in the question to seek information or knowledge.\n\nStep 1. The choices in the question are 1- find a part, 2- go to location, 3- visit a place, 4- have good credit and 5- lose credit.\u2019\n\nStep 2- we can rule out options: 1-find a part, 2\u2013 go to location,\u2019 because these do not describe the action. Option 1-find a \u2018part\u2019 could be a method of how to do the action, but these do not state the actions specifically carried out by the person.

Choices:  C: the bathroom D: the kitchen E: the living room F: the hall\nRationales: This question contains an inference where we need to find the possible or most likely meaning for the word 'eat'.\n1. Start by looking at the other options which may directly and obviously be related.\n2. Consider any items related to food which the children may use frequently to eat or that may be associated with eating such as: pots, spoons, plates, food storage containers, fridge, etc.\n3. All these choices don't fit correctly in the structure used nor do they actually use the word 'eat' so can be ruled out.\n4. The only item not explicitly or directly related is 'the bathroom'.\n5. 'To eat' can mean a lot of things. In this context, it seems to refer to the action of taking food.\n6. The bathroom fits as a place where family or their children may use the bathroom. It doesn't seem to be a place where taking meals or dining would happen.\n7. Therefore it would seem unreasonable to select 'the bathroom' as the answer, but it is the most correct interpretation and therefore the correct answer choice.\nAnswer: C: the bathroom", "answer": "D: frequent"}

Also, J, K, and L are unrelated as they refer to a type of knitwear.\n\nStep 25: Consider choice H, it refers to an adverb which means 'to a large degree'. However, this isn\u2019t a possible modifier for a word or phrase added to dinner, as an adverb has a similar definition for each word or phrase in the list.\n\nStep 76: Option J could potentially be related. It can mean'very far' but this wouldn't be something that can add itself to a phrase for dinner as it indicates too much distance; it is also unlikely for this particular question that the person was eating a type of cake that far away from the dinner table.\n\nStep 92: Options L and M are unrelated, L is an alternative spelling of 'large' and M is a synonym of'much'.\n\nStep 103: Option K refers to short-term loans, which is unrelated.\n\nStep 0: Next, we will consider option N, which refers to 'a little bit'.

We can tell from the question stem that the question is designed to identify the best answer from a list of choices. The choices contain specific businesses that may or may not sell pencils.\n2. Select a choice that could sell pencils and eliminate businesses that cannot.\n3. Use the information to choose the correct answer from what remains.\n4.

Now we have the options 'B' and 'C' still in play, although we don't know the exact relationship.\n6. 'B&N' is actually a bookstore that does not sell pencils, so this eliminates our other choice of a bookstore.\n7. Finally, we have 'pencil depot'.

The fourth option does answer the question.\n\nAnswer: G: winter (B): There are many countries in the northern hemisphere, and many of them experience winter, unlike other seasons. The other options do not answer the question, thus the third option G is the correct answer because it does answer the question in context. The other answers do not, because they say that many of the countries, the countries, in some hemisphere experience some other season. This does not answer the question, because it only answers which hemisphere.\n\n### Tips to answer the instruction questions:\nIn order to answer the questions, we need to first understand what is asked in the question. The words need to be analyzed carefully. To do this, we need to analyze each choice and understand what the choices mean. We need to ask in our minds which choice is the best match for the question. Then, we need to analyze the reason for the choices and understand which word was used specifically in context.

Choices: 1: breakfast meal B: bait C: food D: donut E: fish\nRationales: In this question, the doughnut that the baker has made is a metaphor for something else. From this question, we can see the context and the given choices.\n2. We can analyze each of the options to identify which fits best.\n\n 1. 'Breakfast meal' is not the best choice for this question as it is specific to meals.\n 2. 'Bait' is also not correct. Doughnuts are not generally associated with lures.\n 3. 'Fish' is an option and doughnuts are generally eaten by humans and not fish.\n 4. 'Donut' is actually a valid choice and the simplest grammatically correct option from these. This is because a doughnut is commonly referred to as a donut without any other qualifier.\n 5.

{"text": "record would be 'erase' rather than 'play music'.\n7. Option D, 'play music', may cause a mental association but it doesn't match the meaning as mentioned because it is about the medium and not the action.\n8. Option B, 'compact disc', is not necessary related to burning a physical recording but to compact disc itself which is an alternative to a record as opposed to a tape.\n9. Similarly, option C, 'tape', also doesn't match with the description.\n10. Option A, 'burning the record', could conceivably be a reason for burning a record; however, it does not provide sufficient context to rule out other possibilities. Additionally, burning a compact disc or tape would be more appropriate since the other options are not about burning physical media.\n11. Therefore, the answer for this query would be B: burn compact disc.\nAnswer: B. Burn compact disc\n\nInput: Where do you get an egg if you put it in a jar and wait about 1 minute?

There are pills on the shelf (blue and red). There are crackers on the shelf (purple), and an orange. To the left are some slices of cheese (one is red). There is rice on the shelf and a bowl of soup. The white thing might be some bread.\n\nd) Fridge again: There is no fridge. An orange is on the table.

Choices: A: a dog is watching tv B: a cat is watching tv C: a family member is watching tv D: a baby is watching tv E: no one is watching tv\nRationales: Considering the options:\n1. In option A, there is no mention of the dog at all, suggesting there is no such activity going on.\n2. Option B is more ambiguous as there is the possibility of a cat watching tv. It also mentions other family members watching tv, making it less likely that there would be a single family member watching tv without an additional animal.\n3. Option C is the direct opposite of the question and doesn't make logical sense as to why the whole family would be watching tv if there were just one person watching tv.\n4. In option E, the whole point of the question is to find the answer that accurately depicts an activity that was happening in the context. The other option choices all contradict the question with how they state there is no activity, however we know there was actually an activity as seen in the answer choice that was selected. Therefore, option E is incorrect.\n5. Option D is the answer choice that provides a clear, concise explanation that matches the meaning and context.\nAnswer: Db: a family member is treading tv\n\nInput: What are you most likely to see if you are in a train? Choices: A,B: Tile shelves B: Lid 4: Ll: Shelf C: Shipment of goods D: Wall\nRationales: In order to decipher the correct answer from the possible options, it is first important to understand what 'trains' is referring to in this question. For example, in case of question about the 'train station which one must visit when travelling by train', one must assume that the 'trains' option will refer to the railway station itself, not to the type of vehicle which the train is running on.\n1. Considering this, the possible options that could be a shelf in this context are tile shelves, and shelf.\n2. The other options are not typically related to transportation and are out of context here\n3", "answer": "C: listen carefully"}

Choices: \nA: guilt B: fear C: hatred D: sadness E: confusion\nRationales: Guilt, fear, and sadness are the most likely emotions for someone who is upset about their parents. In contrast, hatred and confusion are more appropriate responses to a different situation.\n1. Although hatred is an emotion, and fear is a negative emotional response, these responses are not appropriate to the situation. \n2. Hatred can refer to a feeling of contempt or dislike, but this emotion is not useful in determining what the upset person is experiencing.\n3. As these emotions are not appropriate, the remaining choices are preferred.\n\nInput: What did she put on her daughter? Choices:  E: her shoes B: her jacket C: her braid D: her hair E: her ponytail\nRationales: Although D: her hair, E: her pony tail and E: her ponytails could be correct, it is unclear how they could also be put on her daughter. So, D: her hair should be rejected, and E: her ponoytails should be accepted.\n\nInput: The dog was sick, what did you do?

Choices:  I: clean carpet II: mop floors III: clean windows IV: replace light bulbs V: vacuum\nRationales: The question is trying to identify the appropriate service to clean a company for which multiple choices are given. We should look at each choice and find its contextual relation to the intended clean-up.\n\nI:clean carpet III:clean windows: They do not offer cleaning as the primary thing they do, but may be secondary or tertiary services they use to facilitate their primary service, making them irrelevant. \n\nII:mop floors I:clean carpet: While mopping a floor can be part of cleaning, it does not exactly solve the specific question which is asking about cleaning the company as a whole. \n\n4:replace light bulbs There are no specific details about this being part of a company which needs cleaning. \n\nV: vacuum There are no specific details that connect this with the company.\n\nThis leaves us with III: clean windows, which is a service that can definitely help clean the entire company as this is the main scope of work.\nAnswer: B III:clean windows\n\nInput: When I was younger I got my first pet where? Choices:  C: the kitchen D: on the counter E: by the door F: in the entryway G: outside \nRationales: Based on the question, we have to find out where and what this \"pet\" may be. Firstly, we should ask, does this line of text mention pets that actually exist or can pets be anything? In this case, it isn't a specific type of animal, but can be anything.\n\nG: outside - While this may be a specific location where pets can be kept outside, it's not necessary for the question. \n\nE: by the door - This may signify the location of an animal, but we don't know if this is referring to a specific location for a pet.\n\nC: the kitchen - This is a logical place to put a pet because they can be caged (like animals in the zoo)", "answer": "D: school"}
{"text": "record is 'erasing history'.\nAnswer: D: erasing history\n \nInput: Which of these would someone who likes baseball not be able to listen to? Choices:  F: country A: sports B: oldies C: jazz D: hip hop E: pop\nRationales:1. Start by analyzng each of the available choices.\n2. A sports-themed radio station would broadcast a wide variety of sports. It may not feature all individual sports but would possibly broadcast sports games that are popular, as well as sports news.\n3. A radio station that plays oldies (or classic or vintage) may not play baseball, but it would certainly play other sports.\n4. A radio station play jazz or country music may or may not play baseball.\n5. But a baseball game involves a lot of cheering and singing and dancing, so a ballgame, unlike a sports game, is not likely to feature music from either of these genres.\n6. Therefore B would be the correct alternative to the question.\nAnswer: B is not able to listen to ballgame.\n \nInput: When you're trying to make a good impression, who are you likely trying to impress? Choices:  B: other than yourself C: other than your group D: yourself E: your group\nRationales: The question is asking which one of the options listed is not someone who you might try to impress.\n1. It should be noted that the first word in the question is 'when'. There is no reason to choose D since we are trying to answer which is the incorrect choice among the options listed.\n2. This being the case, let us evaluate the option choices: 1. It doesn't make sense to think that you are trying to impress yourself.\n3. If you are trying to impress a group, that's not you impressing the group, that's you impressing yourself. \n\n\nAnswer: The answer is B: other than yourself\n \nInput: What can someone get that you have to work for?

A: they will get pushed 2. B: they probably won't get pushed 3. C: their personal space will be violated 4. D: They probably won't get hurt 5. E: They will probably get offended\nRationales:\n\n1. The question is asking \"What do you think is most\nlikely to happen to a person if they step on someone's\npersonal space?\".\n2. In this context, the question is asking for an\nevaluation of potential risks or consequences.\n3. Considering the given options we have to analyze what we can infer about each one as they may or may not describe the potential consequences for the person who stepped on someone's foot.\n4. We can rule out B, probably won't get \"pushed\" as this doesn't describe the risks or consequence for the person.\n5. We can rule out C, because although it is possible, walking on someone's foot is not an infraction of their personal space as this would involve violating their personal space.\n6. We can rule out D, because although it is\npossible, this doesn't accurately describe what would\nhappen if someone stepped on someone's personal\nspace.\n7. We can eliminate E because it doesn't have anything\nto do with the event of walking on someone's personal \nspace and thus, is unnecessary.\n\n8.

E: pennies\nRationales: The question relates to the physical context, specifically what people are most likely to do after they have written a letter. In this case we have to identify the 'desks'.\n1. The desk is where people typically create and keep letters and documents that they've written.\n2. Other choices: 'after they write a letter', 'people', or 'a letter' do not describe the writing of a letter.\n\nRather, a specific place where one keeps a letter after it has been written on the desk is most useful to answer the question.\n\n3.

In fact, \"far\" is the opposite of \"left\" or \"left\" and therefore should be eliminated.\n\nChoices D:\"E near\", while sounds similar to \"far\" can be eliminated as \"far\" and \"near\" are the opposites if each other. \n\nChoices B,\"front\" is a common location for people to see or view a waterfall.\n\nAnd choices D:\"far\" and choices \"A: left\", \"C: right\" are opposites and can be eliminated. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Choices D:\"far\".\nAnswer: D:far\n\nInput: They were riding mopeds, what was happening?

Choices: 1: The site owner 2: The seller3: The advertiser 4: The content creator 5: The subscriber\nRationales: Let\u2019s identify who each option describes in-depth. 1: For option 1, the phrase \u201cthe site owner\u201d means the person who manages or owns the website that\u2019s being used, often someone like a business owner but could be any person or group. 2: For option 2, \u201cthe seller\u201d refers to someone who is selling something. 3: With option 3, \u201cthe advertiser\u201d, the person or persons paying for ads is described. 4: For option 4, \u201cthe content creator\u201d refers to someone who shares ideas, thoughts, photos, video, or other content. The content creator is also someone who adds items to an advertising platform and/or shares it to an online community. 5: Lastly, option 5, \"the subscriber\", refers to someone who uses an online subscription service, but it doesn't have to be a paid service.\nAn example of the phrase \"subscriber\" meaning someone using a paid subscription would be the word \"Netflix\" or \"Hulu\". Another example of a subscription service would be a magazine. \nIn this case, the phrase could describe someone who subscribes to a magazine instead of buying magazines one by one.\n\nSo, with this knowledge of what each term means, let's consider whether the individual options match the purchasing behavior.

Choices:  H. To buy and then renovate the home  I. To buy and then rent the home  J. To pay for the mortgage  K. To pay for a lawyer  L. To pay for an inspection\nRationales:\nExplanation: 1. We must find the possible use or purpose of a person getting money for a home.\n2. Consider each available choice, and think about what purpose would likely motivate someone to request the money.\n3. H. To buy and renovate home could be an option, but is not directly related to getting money, rather, they are the actions after having the money to buy a home.\n4. I. To buy and rent out home is an unrelated action to getting money for the house, just as K to pay for a lawyer or L to pay for an inspection. All of these are indirect actions before or in relation to the money being given.\n5. Option J, To pay for the mortage is a direct action related to getting money, and it makes the most logical sense, as paying a large amount of money is typically why a person will get money.\n6.

Choices: 1. A: game B: system C: software D: game console\n\nRationales:\n1. When evaluating each of the options, it is important to determine whether it is a computer system, software, or a game console.\n\n2. The options for computer system and software clearly do not relate to games on computers, as computers do not use system or software to play games; computers are used for games.\n\n3. The option for game console is a related idea to the options of computer system or software; a game console is used to play games, just as a computer is.\n\n4. However, the option for game console is not necessarily something that a computer is used for. A computer can be used to play games, but a game console is a physical device.\n\n5. Therefore, the best option is B: system, as a computer system is a group of computer hardware components working together to form a computer, thus computers use games, not the game consoles themselves.\n     \nAnswer: B: system\n\nInput: Where would one be if their phone is charged? Choices: 0. A: home 1. B: store 2. C: coffee shop\n\nRationales\n1. The phrase \"phone is charged\" is used because a phone will not function with a depleted battery.\n2. The question then asks where one would be if their phone is currently charged, and as we use the expression \"phone is charged\", we should be asking for answers that relate to the phrase \"phone is charged\".\n3. The answer choices A: home, B: store, and C: coffee shop all refer to locations, places, or environments. In the scenario given, the phrase \"phone is charge\" does not necessarily imply one would be at home, in a store, or at a coffee shop. A phone can be charged anywhere; therefore, any of the locations suggested in the answer choices are incorrect.\n4. The answer, then, is 1. B: the store; as a phone can easily be charged in a store, a phone can also be conveniently charged while someone is shopping or otherwise in a store.", "answer": "D: home depot"}

I just needed a drink, so I grabbed some water out of the fridge and ran back into my room quickly; 4. I was cookin' a steak with some roasted potatoes and gravy on the side, it was just perfect. 5. I was about to eat but my mouth was so dry so I just needed some water.\n\nRationales:\n1. The question asks of what something can be done. The words, \"I was\" indicate an action that has already taken place and we are seeking the context of that action.\n2. Since there was nothing that the person attempted to do, we can eliminate this choice.\n3. The person isn't placing a plastic cup into the microwave because he's just about to eat but his mouth is really dry, he is just about to eat because his mouth is dry. This choice doesn't make sense. Therefore, choose this answer as having a false premise.\n4. We have now left two options and one of the options includes an incorrect prepositional phrase, the choice, \"I was cookin' a...\" would have to be eliminated because the phrase 'I was cookin'a...' indicates a sentence that is incomplete.  \n5. This doesn't make sense because if this were the answer, \"I wanted some water\" would be the logical sentence, however, they just used the phrase, \"I was making popcorn, but it burned...\"  \n\n6.

Choices: 1 A: read it B: buy it C: keep it D: make it E: throw it away\nRationales: (1) First, let's start analyzing each choice to see what they mean.\n(2) First, we'll eliminate'read it' as it's a bit of a redundant choice as the word 'bookmark' is itself a verb and thus means'something used to bookmark' in and of itself.\n(3) Next, we eliminate 'buy it' as a bookmark is a tool of the'reading book' and doesn't generally refer to the entire book itself, though in certain cases it may have some monetary value.\n(4) Now, we have 'keep it','make it', and 'throw it away'.\n(5) 'keep it' and 'throw it away' seem to be good options, but then, if we pick one, what would be the purpose of the other?\n(6) Thus, we have to eliminate 'throw it away' as it doesn't make sense in the context of keeping a bookmark.\n(7) Therefore, we choose between 'keep it' and what one does with a bookmark - make one.\nAnswer:  A: read it\n\nInput: Where can you eat at a restaurant? Choices: 4 A: on the street B: in the kitchen C: out back D: at your desk E: at a table\nRationales:1. The question states: 'Where can you eat at a restaurants?'\n2. The question uses the verb 'eat', but doesn't give any information about its relationship to the 'describing word' which is the term'restaurant'.\n3. We can conclude, that 'eat' is a verb, meaning that people eat, food/beverages/things are eaten. That is to say, 'eat' is related to a 'thing's' consumption.\n4. There are different types of food eaten in various types eateries, all of which are called restaurants.\n5.

A computer needs to be powered on, the power source does not matter.\nThe computers for sale in stores are also powered by batteries.\nSo a computer could be operated without an outlet; it could power the tool, be powered by another power, or not powered at all.\n\nD\nA wrench is powered by a person's use of it. One hand turns the handle manually to open it, using pressure to loosen and tighten the nuts on the screw.\n\nAfter evaluating the choices, we can see that out of all the given options the best answer is B, A wrench because a wrench is used to operate on tools.\n\nInput: What can the person do to a wiring for a house?

Choices:  music B: games C: videos D: work phone calls E: to listen\nRationales: This question is asking what a \"headphone\" can be used for. To answer the question, we must first understand what a headphone is, and how it is different from other types of speakers or phones.\n1. A headphone is simply a type of speaker designed to go over the ear.\n2. The headphone sits on top of the ear and in front of the ear.\n3. This allows the sound to be directed toward the ear more effectively, and makes the sound louder.\n4. Other types of headphones are also used in other functions, such as for headphones for gaming, headphones for movies, etc.\n5. To answer the question of 'what can a headphone be used for', all of the given options are related to music and can be answered by headphones.\n6. Therefore the correct answer would be music\nAnswer: A: music\n\nInput: They want to be a superman, they want to do what? Choices: E: fly A: be invisible B: change the color C: change the shape D: change the size E: super-hero\nRationales: The question is asking what people who want to be supermen (men with super strength) want to be able to do. The answer would have to involve changing the shape/structure of the person's body.\n1. E - Super-hero: This option is out of scope and not the type of ability that the person would be wanting that relates to the question\n2. A - Invisible: This option is also out of scope and does not relate to the question.\n3. B - Change the color: This is also out of scope, it is possible for superheroes with special powers to change the color of themselves or their clothes, but this is not the ability that the person would want to be being supermen would be focusing on.\n4. C - Change the shape: The only ability that would be close to what the person could be seeking out through being supermen would be changing their own shape to strengthen them.

Option A and E don't fit to this context.\n8. Therefore 'destroy history' or 'cover up history' are the best answers to the question.\nAnswer: D, destroy history or cover up history\n\nInput: What do you say something which is similar to the most recent memory to the speaker? Choices:  B: something before  B: never C: something different from  C: something older than E: something which is not  older  then\nRationales:\n1. The question has been formulated in a specific way. It states that what is being asked for is an action of the speaker, that is, the speaker will say something and the listener does certain actions. \n2. What will the listener do will have to match the speaker's action.\n3. The speaker says'something which is earlier', and the listener should say something that will be 'earlier than'. That is, if the speaker said 'three years ago', the listener should say something like 'four years ago'. Alternatively, if the speaker said something like 'five years ago', the listener can say something like'six years ago' since the listener is matching the speaker's action verbatim.\n4. If the speaker says something more recent than their most recent memory, the listener will have to say something more recent than their memory of what the speaker said.\n5. Consider the first scenario where the speaker told the previous action to someone earlier. They would say'something earlier than three years ago' since they've previously said 'three years ago'. \n6. When compared against every other choice, only the option of'something different from' fits in this case.\n7. Let us analyze the other choices:\n8. The first option,'something before', would not work for this scenario since saying'something before' when speaking would be impossible. \n9. 'Something which is not older than' would also not work for this scenario.\n10. 'Something which was not older than' is also out of the list since being 'not older than' is not directly aligned to matching the speaker's verbatim action.\n11. The third option,'something different than' is also wrong", "answer": "C: bitterness"}
{"text": "record is D: erasure.\nAnswer: D. rewrite\n\nInput: The car moved forward, what type of engine? Choices: 1. gasoline B: alternative fuel C: internal combustion D: electric\n\nRationales:1. The car in the analogy must have a type of engine that supports its forward movements, so an answer is needed that is related directly to an engine in a car.\n2. The answers are 'gasoline', 'alternative fuel', 'internal combustion', and 'electric'.\n3. 'Gasoline' and 'internal combustion' are similar enough as each is commonly used in cars as fuel.\n4. However, 'gasoline' is not specifically a type of fuel, more specifically, it is a type of fossil fuel. This is the wrong answer, since the analogy refers to a car that is moving forward which could not use gasoline.\n5. Option B, alternative fuel, is not a part of a car and therefore can be eliminated\n6. The analogy says 'car', not 'truck', so it excludes 'internal combustion engine' which is a term commonly used to refer to engines that burn gasoline.\n7. The analogies in the prompt are made using idiomatic phrasing. This means that 'gasoline' can be interpreted as fuel. Option C, internal combustion, is correct.\n8. Though both electric car engines and internal combustion engines burn fuel or have systems to burn fuel, there's a difference in how they function.\n9. So while internal combustion doesn't consume electricity, it does consume fuel, which can be considered 'burning' in some sense.\n10. Option B only references fuel, which is not as easily confused with an electric engine which is fueled by electricity.\n11. Therefore, option C, internal combustions, is the best answer.\nAnswer: C: internal combustions\n\nInput: There are people in a restaurant that was busy, what is that establishment's name?

First, let\u2019s look at what options are possible causes of an odor and eliminate any unrelated ones quickly.\n2. A \u2018strong odor\u2019 may not come from F: old food because food in a package may still be good, even with a strong odor.\n3.

These are actions trees don't do.\n\nThe remaining choices can be evaluated with the same criteria:\n'grow' - Not possible on a ship, trees take time to grow and a ship doesn't stay in one spot for that long.\n'float' - a tree is usually rooted on a ship to keep it from floating even though it is in water.\n'fall' - while it is possible for leaves to fall from a tree, in general, trees don't fall on ships.\n'blow' - while its possible for leaves to blow from a tree, in a general sense trees don't blow either in or outside of a ship. \n'move' - see above regarding'move'.\n\n'I' and 'H' remain which are actions that trees could possibly do, albeit less likely ones.\nGiven that 'grow' is the action that trees cannot do, there are 2 options that remain:\nJ 'fall' is not actually possible for trees, so this option is eliminated.\n\nThis leaves us with I, which can also be eliminated because 'grow' is not a valid option either.\n\nTherefore, the only option that we can select is G \"float\" because trees can float in water.\nAnswer: G: float", "answer": "A: demonstration"}

Choices:  a) he called security b) he told her to get out c) he took off his hat d) he gave it a high five e) he looked for a doctor\nRationales:1. The question starts off by saying that the bouncer at a bar saw an accident on a horse.\n2. We need to identify what the bouncer did in response to seeing the accident.\n3. We rule out \"High fives,\" \"Telling someboday to get out of town,\" \"Giving a hug,\" and \"Calling security\" as it is clear these cannot be directly related to what the bouncer actually did in the given scenario.\n4. We can infer that he \"gave it a high-five\" and \"high-fived\" is not an action that is directly related to the actions that should be done after witnessing a horse accident.\n5. Similarly, we cannot infer that the bouncer offered a \"hug.\"\n6. Lastly \"taking off his hat\" is an action that people do as a sign of respect or as a sign of mourning or grief and is therefore not appropriate for the given scene.\n7. The remaining option is 'he looked for a doctor' and this is correct as this action allows for the bouncer to appropriately provide help or medical aid to the person he saw involved in the accident.\nAnswer: D. he looked for a doctor", "answer": "A: headache"}

However, the words'stored' and 'usually' hint that a work-related item is something that is used regularly rather than something stored away. Moreover, the question mentions 'usually', and a garage is not likely visited regularly. Also, a garden is a place where the plant is found, not a space where something is placed.\nChoice 3: A library is a space where books are found and read.

Choices: \nA: florist B: seller C: gardener D: customer E: farmer\n\nRationales: As written, the word 'buy' implies you're a customer which eliminates B: seller, C: gardener, D: customer as they seem at odds with the direction the question is taking. \n\nThe other choices also seem inappropriate as 'florist' sounds like someone who works in a floral environment rather than buys flowers, 'farmer' is out of the question as it sounds like a person with a profession rather than a title, and 'gardener' does not convey what the word 'buyers' conveys in the context of this question. \n\nHence, 'farmer' doesn't make sense in the situation, 'gardener' doesn't make the sentence flow correctly in the situation, and 'florist' doesn't seem applicable to the situation, leaving us with 'customer', the most appropriate word in the context of this situation.\n\nAnswer: C: customer\n\nInput: If you were at a restaurant, whose number would you use to call to order? Choices:  P: host's B: diner's C: restaurant's D: the server's E: the kitchen\n\nRationales\n\nAs seen in a previous question example, the most direct solution is the best. First, we can eliminate D: the server' s as the server is the person calling for an order, which would make P: host's the only answer as it is the number for the restaurant.\n\nAnswer: P: host's\n\nInput: How would you write a two-dimensional vector, which is pointing up?

A'regular person' is not defined in the prompt, but we might take it as a person without any noticeable odors. We can easily eliminate the baby, pregnancy, mother, and father because all of them are different from regular people in this sense.\n2. We can also choose no answer just as they are asking for different odors from regular people, and so the absence of a regular person's odor can also be an answer.\nAnswer: No Oddor\n\nInput: If he sees the doctor, it should go where? Choices: 1. A B. C D. E F. G. H. I J.\nRationales:\n1. First, we eliminate all of the choices except where the doctor is seen.\n2. From there, we eliminate choices A, B, C, D, and E because a doctor is seen somewhere they are not: in a medical office, at a hospital, and the like, for example. However, those places could receive visits from a doctor.\n3. Additionally, the doctor could also be seen in a jail, so we eliminate choice J as well.\n4 Finally, he is likely not seen anywhere else apart from his office or a hospital, so we choose choice G.\nAnswer: G.

{"text": "record in context is 'to erase'.\n7. Other options could potentially be related but it seems that erasing information by burning a record would be the most common choice.\n8. The phrase 'burn the record' can also be taken as an idiom, rather than a complete sentence.\n9. We know this because it can be used to indicate the opposite of its literal meaning.\n(i.e. when a record is being burned).\n\nWhen this is considered, the metaphor may be taken to mean the opposite if the speaker is implying\nthat the action they are performing is destructive.\n10. This means we have a metaphoric example where the meaning of the phrase is in the opposite of its literal form, which could suggest that the phrase could be an idiom.\n11. Hence, based on the context, the options that represent an attempt to remove something from history are the most appropriate options B, C, and D.\n\nAnswer: C, erase\n\nInput: What are good if they are a little late? Choices: A: cheesecake B: salad C: ice cream D: pizza E: cookies\nRationales: There are several possible reasons why being early or on time is preferable to being a little late. \n\n1. While a cheesecake, pizza, or salad may be better than nothing, they are not examples of things that are preferable to being late.\n2. A cheesecake, salad, pizza, or cookies, are all food items,\nbut being late is not the sort of situation where\none can be served food.\n3. In addition, good ice cream does not go \"bad\" just because it is late.\n4. The options \"ice cream\",\n\"cheesecake\", and \"salad\" make no sense in this context. \"Ice cream\"\nis a product that you can get even if you are late, and it is not \nas unacceptable as other options like salad or cheesecake.\n5. Therefore, \"cheesecake\" is not appropriate.\n6. Salad may be a healthy food,\nbut it is not something you can get at any time for any reason.\n7. \"Pizza\" is not appropriate because it can become stale or go bad even", "answer": "D: trouble"}

Choices: \n  * A: stuffed animals B: children's clothes C: dolls D: games & toys \nE: pet supplies\nRationales: Analyze the alternatives. 1. First, we have to understand each option. a. 'Stuffed animals' is a toy, like dolls and games but distinct from 'dolls' and 'games & toys'  b. 'Children's clothing' is not a toy but some clothes are toys c. Dolls are a type of toy, so 'game & toys' is not a correct choice d. 'Games & toys' is like option b but excludes clothes as toys. e. 'Games & Toys' is different from option c, but might still be correct f. 'Pet supplies' is not a toys but might overlap with games & toys g. 'Pet supplies', which, if correctly understood, would mean everything to do with animals, but might overlap with games. 2.

Choices:  C: employer D: accountant E: employee F: bank manager G: accountant\nRationales: The question refers to the financial records where employers and employees pay to cover payments and benefits.\n1. In the context of the question, the term 'cover' is used figuratively in the sense that it is covering a financial transaction.\n2. Of the options, only 'put the money in' is suitable because it talks about money putting into something such as a financial transaction.\n3. Therefore, the most suitable answer is C: employer.\nAnswer: C: employer\n\nInput: They wanted the record, why would they want the record?

Each choice provides a different reason for having a record, while not all of them make sense in the given context.\n2. F, H, I, J, and K are all related to 'listening' and do not apply.\n3. G and N fit more to the context, but it's very unlikely that a record would be requested in order to 'learn the words,' which can happen when listening to music.\n4. N and M do not fit because they are not specific to the context.\n5. O is an uncommon word choice, but it can be correct if someone records a song that they can't listen to afterward.\n6.

D: dog-cat shelter. 5. E: bakery.\nRationales: The question asks about finding both a human and cat in a particular location.\n6. This prompts us to evaluate each of the available choices\n7. Option A, 'train station', is a suitable answer as it is a well-known place where people often go as well as animals.\n8. Option B, 'post office', is also a viable choice since both human and cats go in and out of post offices on a regular basis.\n9. Option C, 'bank', is not a suitable place as they do not have many regular visits from humans and cats. \n\n10. Option D, the 'do-cat shelter', has few human visitors but has regular cat visitors, making it a viable option.\n11.

Choices:  C: books A: food B: drink E: gum\nRationales: The question is asking about the store'sells' its inventory to customers.\n\nStep 1: Read the question closely.\n\nStep 2 (examine): This means that we have to assess whether a store could sell food, drink, gum and books.\n\nStep 0 (eliminate): We can eliminate options that are not relevant. For example, selling gum to a customer does not count (you either buy or sell it, but if you buy, it does not appear on your receipt).\n\nStep 03 (evaluate): We now have to analyze each choice.\n\nStep 7 (evaluate): Books! The store sells books, just like it sells drinks. We can eliminate the rest of the options.\n\nStep 9 (evaluate): C is the correct answer.

Choices:  L: watercraft B: ships C: cruise ships D: sailboats E: ocean\nRationales: Start by evaluating each of the choices:\n\n1. \"L\" (letter \"L\") is definitely not a watercraft, so it can be eliminated as an answer.\n\n2. \"Ships\" can be both watercraft and a cruise ship. However, its definition does not allow for it to not be a cruise ship, which is further stated in the question.\n\n3. Similarly, while these could be used for travel, it does not go against the question, which states they are not on a cruise.\n  \n4. \"Sailboats\" can also be used by cruise ships, but they are not used solely by cruises, so it can be ruled out as an answer.\n  \n5. \"Ocean\" is not a watercraft at all, so it can be quickly eliminated as well.  \n  \n6. Therefore, only option D, \"cruise ships\", is consistent in accordance with the question's criteria.\nAnswer: D, cruise ship\n\nInput: In what kind of country was the person from after they graduated?

Birds can make different types of calls, not just one call called 'bird call'.\n\nOption B, 'alarm' is a call specifically for'stay silent' to avoid being caught by somebody else, which doesn't match the context of this conversation.\n\nOption C,'screetch' is a kind of call used for 'attacking a creature', which doesn't fit with the context of this conversation and has different purposes than 'bird call'\n\nOption D,'sing' is the primary purpose of singing, to express happiness or the joy of the song. But, this is not the primary purpose of a 'bird call' as this conversation suggests.\n\nOption E, 'talk'. This would be a kind of talking.

'half past five', 'eight' and 'half past four' are not the 'time when the sun comes up in the morning'.\n3.'seven' at least, is similar to'six' in that it isn't 6am, but a reasonable approximation of that moment. So, let's eliminate those.\n4. While 'half past five' and 'half past three' are not 'half past nine', 'half past nine' and 'half past five' are approximations near 6am, but aren't the same as 6am.\n5. Thus, the answer to the question is'six'.\nAnswer: C,'six'\n\n### Conclusion\nI used the method of question, answer, rationale to analyze questions and answers in these text, and I hope it would be useful for those who want to improve their skills in this way.", "answer": "B: hospital"}

Choices:  a) Appreciate them b) Don\u2019t like the taste c) Give a compliment d) Ask for another e) Tip\nRationales: There are certain choices which are incorrect ones, and certain ones which are logically correct (depending on the situation).\n\nStep 1: Start by analyzing each choice and their meanings. \n\nStep A: 'Appreciate them' implies you don't like it when others say or do things for you.\n\nStep B: You'd 'tip' if that person gave you your tea (usually with a service charge already included, which would be a tip), not in the way of saying \"thank you\" or giving a compliment.\n\nStep C: 'Give a compliment' implies you already like their action. You would be thanking them for making you tea, and giving a compliment might feel like a \"bonus\" to your compliment of \"thank you.\"\nStep D: A compliment should be more than just acknowledgment. It should involve a \"bonus\" like 'thank you' and 'give a compliment'.\n\nStep E: You would give 'tip' to the person who gave you the tea if the tip was deserved. \nStep 2: Let's evaluate the choices based on their order. \n\nStep D: If you liked the tea, you'd obviously want another one.\nStep E: If you liked the taste sufficiently, you'd obviously wish to tip, although it may already be done for you.\nStep A: It goes against the nature of the situation to not appreciate someone who made you tea.\n\nStep B, C: They go in a different direction than the answers, so don't seem to be logical answers.\n\nStep 2 concludes by noting that the correct answers are D and E.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "D: city block"}

{"text": "record is'rewriting history'.\nAnswer: B: tape\n\nInput: The student finished last grade, they want what? Choices:  Choices:  A. A class A. Class B. Group C. Team  D. Group  E. Lesson\nRationales: We need to focus on understanding the meaning of 'finishing a grade'. It is likely that once one finishes a high school or undergraduate course they will continue into college studies. By finishing a grade one is not necessarily expected to \"learn\" another class or lesson.\n\nSo from the existing options, we can eliminate A, D.\n\nThe most likely candidates are B, C and E, all of which relate to 'group' or 'lesson', which is also the least specific choice. While 'team' could conceivably refer to group activities, it is more likely that it relates to sports teams, such as a basketball team.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is B or C which is most closely related.\n\nAnswer: B: class\n\nInput: There was a small town when it flooded which direction did the town move away from? Choices:  W: flooding up from the river E: sea L: to the right N: North\nRationales: The question gives very few details from which to infer a solution. However, our main goal should be to figure out 'which direction' the town moved away from?\n\nSince only 'to the right' fits as an answer choice, let's eliminate all of the other options and go through the choices methodically.\n\nThe first option is W: flooding up. This is not necessarily describing a physical movement and it is in fact more closely related to a change in the water level.\n\nNext, we move on to E, sea level, which is again an incorrect choice as the first option, W, describes a flooding up from a river that the town already inhabited\n\nThirdly, we look at L, to the left, and N, North. Since we know that the town moved away from flooding up from the 'river', this eliminates L and N.\n\nSo, the answer is W: flooding from the river.\n\nAnswer: W: flooding up\n\nInput: They found a book, they were looking at the first chapter of what?

Choices:  the bathroom, a home theater B: the bedroom, a home E: the garage, the dining room  F: the kitchen, the backyard\nRationales: We first must identify a logical sequence of actions or events. Cleaning a carpet could potentially occur before bedtime (if not cleaned regularly) which means it would be appropriate to clean it in a bedroom.\n\nSecondly consider the remaining choices.\n\n* A: bathroom. This choice is a poor choice because it does not indicate a logical sequence of events that would necessarily require a carpet to be cleaned before cleaning it in the bathroom.\n\n* F: backyard. This choice is also not applicable as it does not describe any particular sequence of actions that would require a carpet to first be cleaned in another location before cleaning it in this location.\n\n* B: home theater. This choice cannot be the answer because it is a completely different usage for the carpet. A home theater or cinema typically uses a reclining couch to lie down. Carpets are usually laid down for the floor of a room. \n* E: dining room garage. The same logic apply here as in previous choices. It does not indicate a logical order of events that would necessitate cleaning a carpet before cleaning it.", "answer": "B: getting cold"}

Choices:  (1) Yes A (2) No and (3) Not sure\nRationales: Question: Would you expect to encounter people in the theater (not expecting an exact count)? This question has three possible choices.\n\nOption:\n\nThere could be a different type of people, people from different time period, or people watching a show \n\nRating System:\n\n\nThe given question is a little tricky but once you go through it you would find that the answer is 'Yes'.\n\nReason:\n\nThe most probable reason for there to be people in the theater is a show.

Choices:  I: the army I, II: the military, III: a store, IV: the army\nRationales: A) First, we need to think about whether there can be multiple answers or just one. \nB) Then, we need to think of answers in the context of the question. \nC) Since the correct answer will not be obvious at first, we need to consider each of the given options in the context of the general question. \nD) Finally, we need to determine which two can go together. \nE) In this case, it seems possible that there are multiple answers. \nF) To further explore this idea, it helps to think about what 'you can find' can actually refer to. \nG) It should be possible that many people could be able to find 'toy soldier' in different situations.

{"text": "record is 'Erase'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: The doctor gave her liquid, she was being treated for what? Choices: 1. A: headache B: pain C: drowsiness D: sleep E: anxiety\nRationales: The question presents a scenario involving a doctor meeting with a patient and giving the patient a liquid. We have to find the relevant information that we can find out from this statement.\n1. We see that she is talking to her doctor, which means that she might have sought medical help.\n2. The only reason why he would probably give her liquid instead of tablets is if she has some difficulty swallowing pills.\n3. Liquids can be considered to have the same function as pills when seeking medical treatment, therefore we can answer that she is seeking a form of medication.\n4. The choices provided are 'drowsiness','sleep', 'pain', 'headache', and 'anxiety', and only one of these is a valid reason a doctor would give liquid to a patient.\n5. However, a person is unlikely to take liquid if there is just a headache, pain, or anxiety, they would simply take an available pill instead.\n6. Therefore we can conclude that it was a case of drowsiness, as that is the most specific reason for giving a liquid.\nAnswer: C: drowsiness\n\nInput: It is the most expensive item, what do you think would be second most expensive?

There are other territories that do not include 50 states. Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam are additional locations with residents that are not included in the U.S. mainland. \nOption B, over 20 years, is not accurate either. 20 years is a fairly small time frame and does not account for all people within the U.S.\nOption C, over 30 years, is not the best option since the numbers do not account for all of the demographic makeup within the United States.\nOption D is the most accurate option. 1000 is the proper number of people surveyed and it covers over an entire decade, both being good indicators that the sample is representative of the population.\nAnswer: D, 1000, over 10 years.\n\nInput: What number of people is being inquired about by this question? Choices: A 1000 B 150 C 60 D 200 \nRationales: This question is assessing the accuracy of each given option. We can begin by determining if each choice is correct. Option A, 100 people, is not an accurate number to use in this context.

The possible answers may have associations with \"taking care of the child\".\n\nStep 1: Analyse the given options.\n\nStep 2. Eliminate options that clearly have nothing to do with the child. \n\nStep: 3 Evaluate options that could potentially refer to people taking care of the child or the option does not fit in its context. \n\nStep5: Look for a contextually fitting option and pick it. \n\nThe person taking care of a child is the parents. This is the best answer because the child lives with parents. If, at this moment the parents are taking care of the children, other option may take care of the child.

Choices:  people, food, clothes, beds, showers  A: sleep B: water C: sleep+water D: food+water E: food+sleep+water\nRationales:  1. The question asks the four things that everyone needs to eat. The answer to this needs to be something everyone needs.\n2. Of the given options, some are needs of every person, while some are optional for every person. We have to find an answer that everyone needs and doesn't mean something different to everyone.\n3. There are four options, namely, people, water, food, and sleep.\n4. However, only two of these, water and sleep, apply to everyone, as the meaning of 'everyone' is not ambiguous here.\n5. Now, we can evaluate the remaining options.\n6. Food, clothes, showers, and beds may be desirable for some people, but may not be necessary for everyone.\n7. Therefore only people, water, and sleep, satisfy the criteria.\n8. This leaves the answer to be water and sleep, as these two are needed by everyone.\nAnswer: C: water and", "answer": "E: inaccurate"}

Choices:  C: the room  B: to be more peaceful D: to be bright E: to stay on\nRationales: We know that the question refers to a room, so we need to consider whether the room can get darker.\n\n1. Option B and D are eliminated because they simply say it will be more peaceful or brighter. This makes no sense because a room that is already dark can only get more or less bright.\n2. Answer B is more peaceful because it doesn't change the current situation and simply maintains its peace.\n3. Answer D says that a room will be brighter \"if\" the light goes off, which means it can't be brighter currently to start with.\n4. The remaining options are C and E.\n5. Consider option C. In C, it says that the room will be \"more\" peaceful. But saying that the room will be more peaceful is contradictory because peace and darkness (lack of light) are opposed qualities. The room will be more peace if it were darker. This eliminates option C.\n6. Likewise, option D can't be the correct answer because \"to stay on\" is a different operation than \"to be brighter.\" When a light is on, it stays on (option D). Thus, option E is the right answer because it maintains the current situation and doesn't bring anything else (darkness, brighter, or peace).\nOutput: Option E is the right answer: more peaceful.", "answer": "D: field"}

Choices: A: profit B: growth C: success D: failure E: competition\nRationales: In the given sentence, we find out that the people \"tried\" something, and because of this, we can infer that the people had a goal/wanted some kind of outcome.\nStep 1. We should begin by eliminating all of the options that do not pertain directly to the act of trial itself, or the possible results from an inability to trial.\nStep 2. Options A, B, and D all have to do with business or finances, which is a possible result from a failed trial, but not a trial itself.\nStep 3. Options C and E both have to do with results such as success or failure, but cannot apply if it is a trial for something new that hasn't yet had its outcome.\nStep 4.

However, these actions are generally done by the owner themselves, and it is unlikely that the owner will rent out their own house.\n\n- C: make over are actions where person changes or redecorate parts of the house for rent. While it is also possible that the house is already rented out, it wouldn't make sense for the owner to make the house more appealing if it's already rented or is occupied.\n\n- D: make money is the only option that is consistent with these two points. In this context, make money means the house is rented out to other individuals and is generating income for the owner.\n\n- E: make small refers to doing basic repairs, maintenance, or alterations. Because of the context, these actions don't really make sense.

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: D: erase\n\nInput: You get a letter, what do you do with it? Choices:  a: add new b: read it again c: send it d: send it back e: throw it\nRationales: Initially, we need to understand the question and then break down some of the words in the question to make it more understandable.\n\nStep 1: Read the title which states 'You get a letter'.\n\nStep 2.: Analyze the word 'letter' to identify its definition and if it is an acceptable type of response in the context of the instructions.\n\nStep 2.1: The word letter refers to a document that may contain information or content.\n\nStep 7.2.2: So the initial question reads 'You get a ____' which should be correctly defined as 'document' or 'paper'. Now that it is clearer what kind of type of response is being asked, we can move onto figuring out the best choice.\n\nStep 9.1: Considering the question, we should start with the answer options. The ones with the most context and association with the specific question are 'Add' and 'Read', followed by send and throw respectively with the least relationship and association to the scenario. 'Send it back' seems a little bit vague in that it sounds like it might involve some action related to the letter that isn't really associated with reading or throwing the letter away, making the option more of a contender for the best explanation. Then, there's'send it' which seems like it might mean'sending it to a recipient' and it is a possibility that may be acceptable or correct. But first, consider whether or not reading the letter is an acceptable approach when all you know for sure is you have an unopened letter to do something with. You may choose to read it if:\na. It was addressed to you.\nb. You believe it is important by its contents or source.\nc. You want a record but maybe it's sensitive information.\nThere's no way of knowing, but based on the context of a letter, reading a letter may be the best choice. Next, we can consider throwing the letter away, but it's somewhat of a harsh and irreversible choice. This one doesn't really fit the context either.\nStep 10", "answer": "B: patience"}

Choices:  the room A: bedroom B: study C: bathroom D: office E: room\nRationales: The question consists of two major elements to be considered in deriving an answer: the type of room and the action that cannot be done in it.\n\nThe analysis of room type involves considering the following choices to determine how they relate to the action of putting a lock on a door.\n\nThe room A: bedroom refers to being in a room while sleeping. One would not typically require a lock in such a room where it is not possible to have someone come inside it when the door is closed.\nThe room B: study refers to being in a place you conduct your academic activities such as conducting research, studying and learning. It is a likely place to put a lock and would certainly require a lock in it.\nThe room C: bathroom refers to being in the place with facilities for bathing, including possibly a shower room with separate facilities for men and women. One would typically use door locks on bathroom doors.\nThe room D: office refers to a place where work is commonly carried out, often for paid employment. The room itself may be a large, partitioned office where multiple employees work. One would expect to have doors with locks on an office so that only authorized personnel and guests are permitted entry.\nThe room E: room is referred to a wide range of places. It could be a hotel room, a shared rented room or a home. The room itself does not necessarily require a lock on the door of it.\n\nThis leads us to understand that people do (would) put locks on their doors in some rooms, like in the case of rooms A, B, and C.\n\nA person is in a room D: office.\nOne of the actions that could not be taken in this room is 'putting a lock on the door'.\nAs we have established previously, the room D: office has doors with locks on it already.\nTherefore, option D does not apply to the given scenario.\n\nTo reach the final conclusion, the choices A, B and C can be eliminated because the person cannot put the lock in any of these rooms.\nTherefore left with", "answer": "D: contentment"}

Choices:  I: storybooks J: comic books K: novels M: science fiction N: history\nRationales: Start by identifying what the question requires: it requires us to answer with one of the choices. Based on the context, it is obvious we need to choose a book, in the plural (books). \n1. Consider each of the options, A through N, that may be used to represent this plural.\n2. A: storybooks does not really fit as a plural, or an answer to the question.\n3. B: comic books is similar to storybooks in that they do not fit in a plural manner.\n4. C: novels, D: science fiction, and E: history are all plural in the sense that novels are books, which means they are plural in that sense of the word.\n5. However, that doesn't fit the context of the question. Therefore, it's likely that we need to use a plural form of the word book. \n6. F: books is a singular, but does not fit the role of the chosen answer.\n7. G: book is similar in that it's singular, but also does not fit.\n8. H: books sounds right, but the sentence is odd and would likely not be phrased as such. \n9. 'What type of book would you use to learn about what to do?', would be used.\n10. Therefore, we can reject both J and H as they are not a common form of the word book used as a plural.\n11. K: novels is still a likely choice as it can represent a plural type of book but it doesn't appear to be the correct answer as a plural verb is required. We cannot use a subject of novels as a plural verb unless it's the subject of another verb. The question is not asking about 'how' to expect, so a singular verb cannot be used.\n12.

Choices:  F: the marketplace, G: the store, H: the aisle, I: the kitchen, J: the door\nRationales: The question presented a situation where an option described as'sweet' was likely to more easily be found in an area referred to by certain other options.\n1. Firstly, we eliminate option J, as the answer is certainly not going to be found on the door of an area.\n2. Option H, the aisle, while it could potentially be described as sweet, it is not a reasonable answer choice.\n3. Option I, the kitchen, is not likely to be described as sweet.\n4. Option G, the store, could be described as sweet but in this scenario it is not likely the option that would be more easily described as sweet.\n5. Option F, marketplace, in general places its produce out to be 'exposed'. Therefore, this location would probably be more associated with sweet options as they are more likely to be available for customers to find.\n6. Option F may be a reasonable choice, but it is important to note that when describing something as sweet, it generally is not a specific location in which things are categorized as sweet.\n7. Therefore option F is incorrect because it is not a location but an example of items potentially classified as sweet.\n8.

Option A, the tie, is not logical as no ties are found in the field.\n2. Option B, the overcoat, is also not a logical choice as overcoats are not expected to be inside a field.\n\n3. Option C, the uniform, does not present this situation with the wording \"in a field\", but instead \"in a business\".\n4. Option D, the", "answer": "E: family room"}

E: up 6. F: north side 7. G: south side\nRationales: Start by analyzing each choice. \n\nPick Choice 1:  Choice (A): outer is a good choice as the meaning is that something is not dense. Dense has the meaning of something that is tightly crowded together and in this context, there is no density, so this is a good choice. \n\nContinue with Choice 2: Choice (B): inner is not a good choice because there is nothing mentioned about it being less crowded. \n\nCarry on with Choice 3: \"Between\" is not a good choice as it makes not sense to put a meter in between sections of town. It also doesn't describe a location. We need to remove this choice.\n\nCarry on: Choice (D): downtown is a good choice because downtown is a section of the city that is less dense because of its commercial use. We can eliminate choice (C):\"between\" as we found that's not applicable and also choice(B):\"inner\" because that doesn't make sense and leave choice (D): \"downtown\" which makes sense because it is less dense in terms of people in an urban environment. \n\nCarried on: Choice (F): \"upside\" is not a good option because that means on top, in the air.

{"text": "record and history is C:'rewrite'.\nAnswer: C. rewrite\n\nInput: What can you get in a car when you are going to work? Choices:  a: radio b: carburetor c: tires d: keys e: engine\nRationales: The wording of the question could suggest one of two different meanings or answers. 1) you can only get things from a specific type or make of car, or 2) everything that could possibly be in a car. \n\nFor this question we first want to determine exactly what type of 'things' there are to choose from and then look at each of the specific items on the list provided to try and choose each correctly. We can easily eliminate 4 out of our 5 choices because of this. \n\n'Radio' is one of the available objects from the car, but a driver is not usually the one checking, or listening to, the radio.\n\nThe carburetor and tires are also things 'in a car', but again, the driver wouldn't be the person adjusting or maintaining these components so they can be crossed off.\n\nThe driver could possibly have the keys or engine in a car, so the answer could be A or E. \n\nWe can cross E off as a driver isn't usually the one changing out an engine for another, so D is our only option.\n\nAnswer: D: engine\n\nInput: There was a girl singing.

Choices:  H: yes B: no C: can use the debt to buy the car D: not sure E: no\nRationales: Let's examine and assess each of the choices available in order to better form an answer:\n\n1. Choice A - \"H\", says yes. According to this, you can buy a car because your earnings are very high and you are using them to reduce your debt.\n\n2. Choice B - \"No\", says no. This does not support the statement as it suggests it is impossible for a high-earner to buy a car if they have a large debt.\n\n3. Choice C - \"Can use the debt to get the car\", says yes. This choice refers to the same example and the same logic as the initial yes.\n\n4. Choice D - \"Not sure\". This indicates uncertainty about being able to buy a car despite a high income and considerable debt.\n\n5. Choice E - \"No\", says 'no'. This choice says that a person with a lot of debt cannot afford to buy a car. The choice conflicts with the previous choices.\n\nIt is therefore obvious that the best choice would be the one that contradicts the others. This leaves us with A \"H\" as the only possible answer.\n\nAnswer: H: yes\n\nInput: What type of food is this?

Option B: Have a conversation with, is the best choice if all friends are possible choices, with the person having done it with one or more of the friends. And option A: Have taken a walk with, is the best one if all friends are possible options, with the person having taken a walk with one or more of these friends.\n\nEliminate possibilities if not all the friends are possible in the answer, as the person should have done it with the friend.

Choices:  B: internet C: bank D: store E: friends\nRationales: The given question presents a scenario wherein a gamer is looking to get money. We have to make an inference regarding this act.\n2. Consider the choices and identify which are most logical for the action.\n3. 'Internet' and even 'friends' do not make sense. But, 'bank' and'store' are two places in the context of which a person can get money.\n4. 'Bank' and'store' both are places where a person can get money through purchases, but both also are associated with the act of cashing cheques, taking out and applying for loans.\n5. 'Bank' would be more logical in the given context.\n6. This is because the cashing of cheque which is possible via 'bank' would be more related to the action of getting or exchanging money as opposed to'store' which could be related to purchases of gaming-related products and services.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: Where would you put a paperweight to keep it from falling? Choices:  C: desk D : floor E: table\nRationales: It is to be noted that the question does not provide specific information about the paperweight but only the place or the object where the item would be placed.\n2. We should identify which option can be used to store or place any type of item, e.g. a paperweight.\n3. Now, we can look at the details of each option and deduce their relevance.\n4. 'Desk' is an item on which paperweights can be placed but it is not a physical object itself. So, desk doesn't make sense as a choice.\n5. Similarly, 'floor' is an object on which paperweights may be placed but not the correct choice to identify with respect to the specific question.\n6.

B: nuts: Nuts are not a requirement when cooking a turkey.\nC: eggs: Eggs are not necessary to cook a turkey. D: milk: Milk is not needed in order to cook a turkey and is not needed per se for a christmas meal.\nE: potatoes: Potatoes are delicious and are often part of a christmas meal, but they are a vegetable, not a spice, so they do not affect the taste of the meal. \nF: cranberries: Cranberries may be served on christmas but are not necessary for the meal itself.

Then,we forgot to bring our homework \n2.The first sentence of the instruction is in the past tense and describes an action that occurred in the past. The second sentence uses the present tense, possibly indicating a future action in which the speaker is reminding the reader of something.\n3.The remaining 4 choices don't match the past tense action from the first sentence.\n4.They mentioned they were in the cafeteriam.

Now, we are attempting to ascertain a specific question regarding the use of a clock on those two surfaces, that is, 'What would be used to make sure it has NOT BEEN put on the shelf or the desk. \n4. This is the best interpretation of this question for which we must use the given options and try to find the best fit.\n5. The choices have the following common attributes:\n    1. They are not objects, not a part of or on a surface or an item like a shelf or a clock.\n    2. They tend to have the potential to act, that is they act to cause/stop an action or something like that.\n    3. They are not likely to be used to'make sure' something hasn't happened or isn't happening.\n\n        A: is a hair dryer, although hair dryers often blow or blow hot air, they are too big and noisy to act as an effective deterrent and are not even placed on a shelf or the desks in the first place as that may be the implied case. Hence, it eliminates it as an answer choice because it would not make sense.\n\n        B: is an alarm clock. It is very possible that a person would set an alarm on a clock as a signal that their time is up. Although it can also serve as an alarm to go off when one needs to wake up, it works best if we interpret it as an alarm. Hence, it eliminated it as its meaning is not quite clear to the implied meaning of a clock on a shelf.\n\n        C: is a fan. It is a device that is used usually for cooling/drying the air. It would not be logical to say it can stop the act of putting a clock on a shelve", "answer": "A: health center"}

C: added cheese D: added salt 4. E: added tomatoes\nRationales:\n1. From the outset, we can differentiate option A as water is not commonly added to food, except when creating a broth.\n2. Another obvious difference is option B, milk, which is not generally added to food in the same way cheese is. \n3. 'Cheese' is the answer because it is the final ingredient in the list and because it is the only item in the list that is applied externally. \n4. Option D (salt) is a possible answer because it might add flavor to food. Also, food can sometimes be'salty'.\n5. But'salty' does not refer to its ingredient being'salty', it refers to the salt being used, making D not the correct answer. \n6. Option E, 'tomatoes', is one of the ingredients but it doesn't change the food after it's added. \n7. Therefore, C is the correct answer because cheese is added externally.  \n\nAnswer: C: cheese\n\nInput: What did the woman see when she looked out the window? Choices: \n1. A: dog B: lion C: kitten D: horse E: bird\nRationales: Based on the question it's clear that the \"dog\" in the window is the most significant element to the entire question and should be the focus point of our analysis. \n1. To start, let's eliminate all other answers that don't seem relevant or possible. \n2. \"Lion\" and \"kitten\" are unlikely animals that wouldn't be viewed through a window and should be eliminated.\n\n3. The reason a lot of other animals such as \"horse\" or bird can be ruled out is because the phrasing and word choice of the question does a good job of explaining why the lion is important. \n4. While \"birds\" can certainly be viewed through windows, and horses and lions are usually associated with fences", "answer": "B: gorge"}

E:  not at all\nRationales: The given expression means that the speaker doesn't typically consume coffee and the question presents various hypothetical places where one could get a coffee. Let's take each answer in turn.\nOption A: A bar. This option doesn't have anything that would suggest that it sells coffee.\nOption B: A coffee shop would sell coffee.\nOption C: A coffee shop or store. These could both potentially sell coffee.\nOption D: A store. Stores generally don't sell coffee.\nOption E: No. It is possible to get coffee at any of the mentioned locations, but not in stores.\nOption A does not lead in the direction of drinking coffee. Option B indicates selling coffee and option C includes the word \u2018coffee\u2019. Option D does not mention coffee at all and option E says \u2018no\u2019.\nOption B is the best answer.\nAnswer: B. A coffee shop.\n\nInput: What did the doctor's patient say while recovering from their surgery? Choices: \n1. A: the doctor needs to be careful and cautious\n2. B: they are very concerned and worried about the outcome of the surgery\n3. C: they have severe headaches\n4. D: they had a hard time adjusting to a new bed\n5. E: they would like a check-up\nRationales: Option A: This question is about a patient who was in the hospital recovering from surgery. The patient is worried about the outcome and might have some complaints or concerns because of the surgery. Some of these complaints might be about their doctor. \nOption B: The patient is not speaking to anyone at this time because they are still getting over their surgery. \nOption C: The patient might be speaking with the doctor or anyone at the hospital, but they are not going to share these details because the patient is worried about their surgery and wants to be in their own head.\n\nOption D: The patient has been relocated", "answer": "A: satisfaction"}

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: When is it possible that someone receives money? Choices: 1. When their car breaks down, 2. When you sell their house, 3. When the bartender makes another beer, 4. When I ask for help fixing a pipe, 5. When I accidentally cut my nails\nRationales: There are four possible answers in the choices, let's review each of them.\n\n1. A possible answer is \"when their car breaks down.\" When a person's car breaks down, they may receive money from their insurance company or from a vehicle repair shop. Money received for their car's breakdown has nothing to do with helping them fill up to pump gas in their car, but they could also receive money for gas as a result of breaking down. \n\n2. Another possible answer is \"when you sell their house.\" When you sell their house you could receive a sum of money at closing. It\u2019s possible to sell your house and not receive any money. However, if you are listing the house for sale, it is possible that you will receive payment from the buyer\u2019s lender for closing costs, but this payment is not direct compensation for the sale of the residence. \n\n3. A third potential answer is \"when I ask for help fixing the pipe.\" If someone asks for help fixing a pipe and the help provided is compensation received, that is money received. \n\n4. Finally, the fourth and last answer is \"when I cut my nails.\" Receiving money is not the primary reason someone asks for help. Receiving money is only an incidental benefit associated with asking for help.\n\nAnswer: The second answer that would be correct in this scenario would be a \"when you sell their car\".\nAnswer: A: when you sell their car\n\nInput: What do you call it when a car is broken down? Choices: 3. A flat tire, 4. A leaking brake, 5. A problem with the electrical system, 6. A collision, 7. Not working\nRationales: Let\u2019s take the seven answers and evaluate them.\n\n3. A flat tube is not enough for someone to diagnose a problem with their car, for example if a flat tire is the only problem their car", "answer": "D: unhappy"}
{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: C:'erase'\n\nInput: Where can be accessed the Internet to a computer? Choices: 1: cemetery 2: home 3: cafes 4: bookstore 5: classroom\nRationales: In the question, there are some options that can access the Internet and some that can\u2019t. These options have a relationship with the Internet that is either a cause or result of accessing the Internet.\n\n1) Option 1 (cemetery) \u2013 This choice cannot access the Internet. Therefore, it has nothing to do with the Internet.\n\n2) Option 2 (home) \u2013 Home is where the access to the Internet has occurred in the question. It is the location closest to an individual, which can explain how the computer can access the Internet.\n\n3) Option 3 (cafes) \u2013 Cafes are places where people can access the Internet through computers or personal devices. Therefore, it can access the Internet through an external device or computer at that location.\n\n4) Option 4 (bookstore) \u2013 Bookstores do not usually provide Internet access to customers. Therefore, it cannot access the Internet as it is a location where people may have access to an external computer or device connected to the Internet.\n\n5) Option 5 (classroom) \u2013 A classroom is where people are generally expected to have a place to access the Internet. Therefore it can access the Internet, as it already has the equipment necessary for it to do so.\n\nConclusion: The choice that has the closest relationship to accessing the Internet is option 2 (home). It is the closest home location where the computer can access the internet.\n```\nRationale: The answer to the question is 2. Choice 3 is the only incorrect one but it is the only one that makes sense out of the other choices. Choice 1 is the only one that cannot have access to the internet.\n```", "answer": "A: do crossword puzzle"}

Iced water is a cold variant of plain water. \n\nAnswer: D. Iced Water\n\nInput: I should take my car to another mechanic, why? Choices: B: not satisfied with the first mechanic C: I heard a lot of positive feedback about the second mechanic D: I heard the first mechanic was not trustworthy and should not be trusted. E: I feel unsatisfied with the first mechanic.\nRationales: The correct answer is E. The other answers don't have enough information to determine how the decision should be.\n\nInput: What did you use to pay for the ticket?

{"text": "record is'rewrite history'.\nAnswer: B: rewrite history\n\nInput: How does a car get going, what happens? Choices: 1. A: starts 2. B: goes 3. C: turn on 4. D: turns off 5. E: start up\nRationales: When reading a prompt question, it's important to analyze the scenario and context. Here, we know that someone is driving a car, we don't know if it's a manual or automatic. This will affect the answer.\n\n1. Looking at the answer choices, we see that the only common trait among the four different options is that all of them indicate that there is some form of starting or finishing happening.\n2. 'Starts', 'goes', 'turn on', 'turns off' and'start up' are all phrases that indicate movement. Since we know a person or car is standing still, none of these answers are correct.\n3. This leaves us with'starts' and 'turn on'. Both'starts' and'starts up' can refer to a start or finish of something. Either of them could indicate a start or finish of driving a car, so these are the right answer.\nAnswer:C: turns on\n\n---\n\n### Task:\n\n### Instructions:\n\n### Demostration:\n### Question 1:\n### Answer 1:\nInput: What did the manager tell the employee to do?

Choices:  B: Shakespeare E: Dickens C: Moli\u00e8re D: Wilde F: Hemingway\nRationales: The question is a multi-part question. It asks for who a man liked theater, then it asks which of the provided choices could be men who attend to dinner parties.\n\nWe have to identify the person and the type of party.\n\nThe information regarding the man's taste in theater points to Shakespeare. It was an option before so we can eliminate it, but we couldn't have chosen another answer because we were asked to choose an option who liked theater.\n\nThe answers left to choose from are Hemingway, Dickens, Wilde, and Moli\u00e8re.\n\nBased on the previous information, if we choose, Dickens or Hemingway, then the party is \"dinner parties.\" Moli\u00e8re or Wilde can also be party goers, but they may also attend other parties, so it's hard to distinguish if they will attend a specific dinner party.\n\nThus, the correct answer has to be the option that would be likely to attend a dinner party among the given options. Only \"Dickens\" would attend a dinner party, as the other options might attend some other type of party.\nAnswer: E: Dickens\n\nInput: What was it if it has a key? Choices:  C: vehicle E: lock F: vault G: safe\nRationales: This question has two possible answers, 'F' and 'G' that you'd probably wouldn't guess as the right answer. It is because of the way it's phrased. \n\n'What was it?' is used to ask 'what type of thing is it' or 'what is it's type'. The answer will be given by following the prepositional phrase 'if it has a key'.\n\nBoth 'lock' and 'vault' have keys and both can be considered potential choices. \n\nWe have to eliminate one so it follows the general pattern of 'if it has a lock then it is a (lock)'. Based on that, the answer is 'lock'.\nAnswer: C", "answer": "D: further education"}

Choices: 1: I go outside on my porch. 2: I read the newspaper. 3: I go out for coffee. 4: I go to the grocery store. 5: I go for a walk. 6: I play with a friend. 7: I go the gym. 8: I try a new recipe. 9: I watch a comedy. 10: I watch a historical movie. 11: I play with my cats. 12: I watch television. 13: I go to the library. 14: I go to a spa. 15: I go to the ocean\nRationales: In this particular question, the writer is using a list to answer a very broad yet specific question. For each of the 14 elements, the writer needs to think about the things listed and then select the one thing they think fits with the word \u2018most\u2019. However, this is a very subjective thing to do. There\u2019s no right- or wrong question to answer. Instead, the writer needs to identify and justify as best they can. Therefore, the correct answer can\u2019t necessarily be chosen because no single answer is the correct answer. Still, since there are a few choices in this question, we can determine an answer in the following way:\n\nThinking about the 14 options given, consider what each entails. Certain options only fit a part of what is asked. The following options only address part of a single element which is a good starting point for the writer to work with but it does not encompass the full question and therefore cannot be an accurate answer, even though they may be valid options.\n\n14. Library\n\nGoing to the library is actually an action you can do. So, this can be eliminated from consideration.\n\n15. Spa\n\nAgain, a valid choice but does not fully encompass \u2018most\u2019. Therefore, this is not a full answer.\n\n10. Historical movie\n\nWatching historical movies is part of watching TV. This choice alone, is not enough to justify in the context of the question.", "answer": "E: motorcycle"}

Choices:  F: yes B: nights C: days D: afternoons E: all\nRationales: First, there is an implication in this scenario. The question refers to a person who says that he will get 8 hours of rest and sleeping in a day. According to the given statement, the person does not sleep in a day because he sleep more than 8 hours. A person who talks about his sleeping habits will not lie about it.\nFurthermore, there are seven possibilities given in the question. Among these choices, three choices are unsuitable for the given context. The second possibility is correct, the person sleeping in a day is not included in those choices. So, this one is the correct answer. Answer: F: No\n\nInput: What can a man help you do with a flower? Choices:  Help you grow with the flower A: B: C: D: E: F: all these\nRationales: In the given scenario, the man can help you to either grow or harvest the flower with the help of it. The above choices clearly indicate that there are many other things a man can do with a flower and that the scenario does not cover all. Choice E is not related to this as it is too broad, which leads us to the right choice, which is F. Answer:  F: All these\n\nInput: What will you see when a person gets out of the cage while you are in there? Choices:  B: you A: the sky C: the person D: many birds E: nothing\nRationales: This puzzle is about someone\u2019s ability to see when they are in the cage and someone is outside. The options are given under each choice. Here the person will either see the person who got out or nothing, nothing is impossible here. It is just a choice, as you would be there, you will be in the cage seeing the person\u2019s actions. There will be nothing here. In this case, the best answer is 'None'.\n\nInput: Why would the person ask if they are free then? Choices:  If they are not A: Yes B: No C: Wait a few seconds E:", "answer": "C: collection"}

Choices: 1. A: To enjoy wearing them 2. B: In case they get wet 3. C: Because they may slip in the rain 4. D: Both A & B 5. E: In case of a thunderstorm \nRationales: In context, shorts are a type of clothing which may be worn on a rainy day. The reasons for people wearing shorts, in the rain, may vary.\n\n1. The first reason, to enjoy wearing them, is a valid option.\n\n2. The second option, in case they get wet, also fits as wearing short while it may be raining, may allow them to prevent their clothes from getting wet.\n\n3. The third option may also be viable as shorts may wet in rainy conditions.\n\n4. Option D is not valid as wearing shorts may not necessarily cause wetness in the case of it being rainy, whereas getting wet may be caused by being in contact with rain water. We may be able to wear shorts comfortably in a rainy season.\n\n5. This leaves us with option E as the best choice, which states 'in case of a thunder storm'.\nIn this case, 'In case of a thunder-storm' is not related to shorts, in rainy condition, rather the storm of thunder itself.\n\nAnswer: E: in case of a thunder\n\nInput: Where do they normally use the cash card from their bank?

A person may carry cards to various places they could use, where they would use them is context dependent.\n\nNow here's a method you can use to crack the question\n\n1.

B: to fight C: to be cool D: a refund E: shoes\nRationales: In order to answer this question, we can use the logic of the situation. He is wearing his shins guard as pants, which makes no sense as pants traditionally cover legs and protect lower limbs against damage. This leaves us with either it is a form of performance art or he wants to be cool.\n\nStep 1: Start by analyzing each of the options.\n\nStep 2.  Look at each option to discard anything that isn't logical or doesn't make sense\n\nStep 3. Considering we are looking for an answer that can't be disregarded for logical or sensical reasoning, the best answer should be one that is not related to the other choices.\n\nStep3: Considering this we can eliminate the answer B, it doesn't make sense as he can't wear shin guard as a pair of pants, he can only wear it as a protection for his leg while playing sports.\n\nStep 7. Now that we know we can eliminate the B answer, we can move on to answer D, he wants shoes. We can cross-reference this with how he could potentially use his shin guard and see that it doesn't make any logical sense as there's no other option of using shin guard as a form of footwear.\n\nStep 9. Therefore, the answer that does make logical sense and is also the only option that remains is that he wants shoes.\nAnswer: D. shoes\n\nInput: If someone is on their way, what should they do?

There are twelve options, so we'll need to carefully consider each option.\n\nStep 1: Determine which option matches the question.\n\nStep 2. Analyse each of the 12 options. Consider how each one is linked to the question.\n\n1. It is easy to think of customer service people as they work in an office or customer service company. A lot of people mistakenly associate it with a job and that if you are in a  customer-based industry you will only work in 1. However, customer service is actually just one kind of workspace. It includes all places where there may be contact with customers such as restaurants and retail outlets. A person who works in customer service generally works somewhere where there is an engagement with customers. \n\n2. It goes the same for food services. A person in this field has an interaction with the public and can be found working in a variety of locations and spaces, not just restaurants. Any food-oriented industry will require the interaction and handling of food. Some examples could be places or situations such as hospitals, grocery stores, hotels as well as airports and cruise ships. \n\n3. The same can be said for home-based work and construction. Generally speaking, if you work at home, you're not necessarily a home painter or a home plumber. There are many home-based businesses and jobs that are not affiliated with any construction or home-related field. \n\n4.

Choices:  a) sing  b) play loud  c) play faster  d) play louder  e) play slower\nRationales: A: sing: a person playing a piano should not sing rather than play louder.\nB: play loud: a person playing a is a noun and should not play louder. a person should only play louder. it could also be play loudly or play louder. A: play louder: a person playing a should play loudly. b & c is incorrect since it is a noun\nD: play louder\nE: play slower not applicable since the sentence states person playing a piano.\n\nInput: What should you be able to do while playing a video game?

This should be B: control fast.\nD: control slow, not applicable since the sentence is saying what should you be able to while playing a video game\n\n### Exercise: What type of action is depicted by the picture?\n\n![](pics/p124-a.png)\n\nWhat type of action is depicting in this picture?\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "B: cash in"}

Choices: \t\t\tA: car B: lock box C: house D: pantry E: cupboard\nRationales: You are looking at how the user completes the action and this tells you the answer.\n1.

The action of putting keys by the door may not make sense when the context of where the person lives is not given.\n\n3. Considering the above we start to analyse each option (A, B, C, D, E).\n\n4. A, the car, seems like the wrong response because cars have a specific lock on the car for the keys.\n\n5. B means the lock box which seems like the wrong place, then D means the pantry but it does not seem like the place, then E means the cupboard which does not seem right either.\n\n6.

Using a map is the most appropriate option as it is considered to be the most reliable tool for navigating.\n\nThe other options would be unhelpful towards finding missed turns. Phone uses GPS, which will require the user to have a constant internet connection to determine the location. Internet is unavailable everywhere, and is not a reliable mode of transportation.

Choices:  B: a needle C: detergent D: sandpaper E: water\nRationales: In the question, we want to identify the solution for removing scatches from clothes. \n\nStep: Consider each choice in comparison to the question's context about removing scatches from clothing.\n\nStep: Examining each choice, you can note:\n\nStep: So from the above analysis, it suggests that only 'water' and 'a needle' can be used to remove scatches.\n\nStep: For 'water', it is an ineffective choice and cannot be used.\n\nStep: This leaves us with 'a needle', which can effectively remove scatches. \nAnswer: C: A needle\n\nInput: What can do to a dungeon of a castle? What isn't it? Choices:  D: put in a closet E: lock F: take out a castle\nRationales: A quick reading of the question might suggest the second question is an exact replica of the first, but a good logical approach is required to answer it.\n\nStep: The first question has three choices. Choice F is \"take a castle\", which is a completely unrelated option and can be eliminated. Choice E is \"lock\", which is not the same as \"what do you use\" and can be eliminated too; the question asks about the process that happens within the dungeon of a catsle (putting something in does not necessarily mean locking it).\n\nStep: Choices A-C are three synonyms for closets; these are definitely not related to removing scatches from a dungeon in a castle.\n\nStep: Now, the second question is asking what one would do in a castle's dungeon. \n\nStep-A: Look at the question carefully. The first two of the five listed questions are very specific, with only one of the choices being an exact match.\n\nStep-B: Since the choice \"puts in a closet\" does not make sense in the context of", "answer": "A: learning"}
{"text": "physical record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: A: compact disc\n\nInput: Where would you likely get a cake? Choices: 1: A: bakery B: shop C: home E: restaurant\nRationales: The question asks in what kind of environment you would commonly get a cake. Given the options, there are three main environments in which one would typically get a cake: 1. a bakery 2. a shop 3. a home.\nEach of these environments is different when it comes to how to acquire a cake. A shop would allow you to purchase a cake from a company that sells many other things besides cakes. \nYou would often get a cake in a home by baking said cake yourself or having someone else bake it in your home for you. \nAnd lastly, you would get a pre-built frozen cake at a bakery, which you would not typically do at a home or a restaurant.\n\nWith these factors in mind, the most appropriate answer would be A: bakery.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: The girl had the carrot, what is the vegetable? Choices:  B: potato C: lettuce D: carrot\nRationales: This one is fairly easy to answer. The question is asking about one of the vegetable types, carrot. There are two ways to determine this. 1. The girl had the carrott, so the carrot is the vegetable. 2. We can remove the word 'the' from the entire sentence. (The girl had carrot.) Carrot is the vegetable because it is one of the types of vegetables. Choice A(potato), choice C(lettuce), and choice D(carrot) are all correct answers.\nAnswer: C: lettuce\n\nInput: A person doesn't buy tickets, what will they do for the event?

C: You are tired of wearing the same old clothes you usually wear. 4. D: You are looking to the way people are dressed to see how you should dress. 5. E: You don't know whether the clothes will look good or not on you.\nRationales:1. The question asks to identify the reason that can prompt a person to decide to wear what is being worn. The question is phrased slightly differently and the phrase is important.\n2. We have to choose the answer that is most closely related and closely matches the provided options.3. Considering the provided options, the option 'B' means that a person thinks a particular type of clothes looks good based on their perception or idea, and wears it based on this preference.\n4. 'You are looking to the way other people are dressed to see whether you should dress in a certain way': This option can be linked to the choice 'B' as it indicates the person is influenced by what other people are wearing or what 'fashion' is currently trendy.\n5. 'You are tired of the same clothes that you wear': This alternative indicates a disruptive motivating factor to the person to wear a different type of clothes.\n6. The choice 'C' means that a person wants to wear a different type or a 'different look' based on their disinterest of what they were previously wearing.\n7. The statement 'these clothes are too small' does not indicate the motivating choice of what to wear, as the phrasing indicates the person is specifically concerned about a smaller fit.\n8. Therefore the option that best matches the motivating factor to wear a particular type or 'look' is 'B', 'You like the design of the dress.'\nAnswer: B: You like the dress\n\nInput: The train driver can't work, what will the ticket-seller do?

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: C, erase\n\nInput: What did he do, if he got hit by car? Choices: A: got hurt B: got away C: got caught D: got a headache E: got wet\nRationales: This question essentially asks about a specific action, such as 'being hit by something' which must be followed by some type of outcome, such as 'become hurt'.\n1. To solve the question, we must identify what that'something' would be in the question.\n2. Since the other options (got away, got caught, got a headache, got wet) all relate to actions and the consequences are not part of the question, only 'got hurt' is a valid option.\n3. Therefore, the answer to this question is 'A: Got hurt'.\nAnswer: A: got hurt\n\nInput: What are you looking for, if you are doing something with someone? Choices: 1. Looking for something interesting\n2. Looking for something that is related to what you are doing\n3. Looking for something that you are looking for with them\n4. Looking for a specific item that goes with what you are doing 5. Looking for a place to do what you are doing\nRationales: The question asks for the meaning of 'looking' when in context of'something with someone' within the same sentence. In this case,'something' is the main element, and 'what you are doing' will be linked with the'something'.\n1. The choices represent different actions and they are not relevant to the meaning of 'looking'.\n2. The most suitable choice is 'looking for something interesting' which is in the same context as the original.\n3. The alternative answer of 'looking for a specific item that is goes with something you are doing' also fits with the original context, but is more general and doesn\u2019t specifically imply an item that relates to the original context.\n4. 'looking for something related you are doing' also matches with the context, but it doesn\u2019t fit the context of 'with someone'.\n5. There isn\u2019t an answer which fits with the context of both'something' and 'with someone' simultaneously.\nAnswer: A) Looking for something interesting\n\nInput: What they did, if they are trying to kill someone?

Choices: A: leaves  B: goes to bathroom C: wait for waitress D: orders food E: eats\nRationales: The question mentions a situation where a person is at a restaurant. While at a restaurant, a person commonly does some actions, including 'wait for waitress' or 'order food'.\nIn relation to the given options, consider the following:\n\nStep 1: Exclude options which are not relevant in that order.\n\nStep 2 : Determine which has a higher probability of occurrence according to the question.\n\nStep 1, Option A and B are related to the restaurant being a place and is irrelevant for this question as it states to do something that could happen at a restaurant.\n\nStep 7, Option E is related to eating food at a restaurant. This option is out of the scope of the question since it is not a common action done while at a restaurant.\nStep 7. Option C (wait for waitress) is likely to be done at a restaurant because customers may be waiting for the waiter/waitress to take their order or deliver food.\n\nStep 9. Option E is a common action that can be observed at a particular location such as at a restaurant. There are people who may eat at a certain location and the action of eating can be done by a wide variety of people and is not limited to a specific set of people.\n\nStep 0. Option C is related to the ordering of food at a restaurant location, which matches the given scenario of the question.

Choices:  a: home b: theater c: car d: train e: house\nRationales: At this point, it is important to remember that the correct answer can be determined by following a series of logical steps.\n\nThe first of these steps is to analyze the question.\n\nIn this case, the question seeks to determine where a movie will be watched without using a traditional cinema. \n\nThe next step is to eliminate the invalid options.\n\nWe can begin by eliminating options a, b, and c because they do not match the intent of the question.\n\nOption a refers to watching a movie in your home, which would not be considered a cinema. \n\nOption b refers to a movie being watched at a theater, which by definition, is a cinema. \n Option c refers to watching a movie while in a car, which would not be within the context of the question, as the intention is to not use a cinema.\n\nThe remaining options d and e are correct.\n\nA movie will not be watched within a movie theater; therefore, option d is true.\n\nA movie would not be watched or be streamed in a home, because that is where movies will typically be watched.\n\nSo, in this case, the correct option would be e, your house.\n\nAnswer: E: house\n\nInput: They are trying to keep the cat off furniture, what they are doing?

Choices: 1: paintings 2: books 3: food 4: jewelry 5: furniture\nRationales: The first question that arises after reading the choices is, what exactly constitutes an attic? Usually, an attic is a kind of room with high ceilings found on top of a house with a large number of square meters devoted to storage. \n\nFrom the given four options to place in an attic, we can eliminate food, as it isn\u2019t the kind of thing that one would typically keep in an attic. We can also eliminate furniture, books, and paintings, because all of these options are more suitable for keeping in a room.\n\nHowever, the option that best fits an attic is jewelry, as jewelry typically does not occupy a large space.\n\nIn the last part of the question, a fifth option is presented. The answer that can most suitably be used in this final option is paintings, as paintings are the most likely thing to be found in an attic.\n\nAnswer: C, jewelry, + D, paintings\n\nInput: What do you use to clean the floor? Choices:  D: vacuum  B: mop  E: broom C: carpet  A: rugs\nRationales: Finding the right answer to this question is challenging as in the given three options, it isn't clear which one is to be cleaned, the floor or the room/roof it is located on.

The answer would be 'erase', or a more generic version of 'trying to eliminate'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: If you are holding something, you don't usually want to drop it. Choices: A: book C: paper D: magazine E: bottle\nRationales: Considering the different items for which one would typically not want to drop them, the choices provided to be analyzed are : \n\n###### Books: \nThey are not easy to replace since they are very expensive. They are also heavy, so it would take some effort to drop them.\n\n###### Magazines: \nMagazines rarely contain high value items such as gems or other expensive objects. Dropping them, especially near another person, would be a very embarrassing experience.\n\n###### Paper: \nThey are easy to replace, and even if one does drop them and it crumples, it's easy to iron them out. Paper items are light, and dropping them is easy. A drop would not cause any serious damage either.\n\n###### Bottles: \nBottles are generally made out of glass or an opaque plastic, which makes the inside items difficult to see. As they are heavy, they would most likely shatter if someone dropped them. There is probably a lot of material inside the bottle that one does not want to compromise, such as prescriptions, pills, vitamins, etc.\n\nThus, it makes most sense to choose the choice that contains the items people would least want to drop, i.e., magazine and bottles. \nAnswer: C: paper, D: magazine\n\nInput: If someone has 10 items each weighing 2 kg, what does they have in total?

However, this reasoning falls short as 'erase' is not what can be done, it's an indirect action that describes the overall effect of 'burning'.\n8. Then, 'destroy' is a direct action that directly fulfills the meaning of destroying by burning. Thus, 'destroy' can be accepted as the correct answer.\n9. Similarly, all the other answers have no relation to the action of 'burning' and may seem at first glance like possible reasons, but a close examination reveals they don't fit the correct answer.\n10.

We can now consider each country at a time using the following chart as reference:  https://www.nzz.ch/kulturrouten/artikel/lissabon-kosmisch-einfamilienhaus-1.14949967\n \n1.

Choices:  Flip over A: break B: leak C: drown D: overheat\nRationales: Considering the given options, we should evaluate each given choice and understand which fits best the meaning of the question.\n\n1) 'Flip over' doesn't directly answer the question, but a device can be dropped and flip over to face another side. So, the correct answer could be the choice.\n2) 'Break' doesn't relate to the given choices.\n3) 'Leak' is used in the context of water, but it would apply better to the act of a device getting wet with water.\n4) 'Drown' means to die. If the drop itself is small enough, the device won't be drown or die.\n5) 'Overheat' could be part of an over-complex answer as it can't be a specific part of dropping the device into water.\n6) From all these considerations, 'B', break, is the best match based on how the option could be logically connected to the original question. So, 'break' is the correct answer to the question.\n\n## Contest Problem 5:\nInput: The person puts on lotion, what can they put it on? Choices:  S: skin  C: shirt D: hair E: body\nRationales:1. The question is asking about a place where one puts lotion. We have several options.\n2. Let\u2019s break down the choices from A down:\n\n3. 'Skin' is a given choice that is correct to be paired with 'lotion', but it is too vague. There are several things one can put lotion on, including skin, hair, or the body.\n4. With'skin', it is a correct answer but too vague.\n5. By comparing 'hair' and 'body', since they are both generic words, 'body' is better than 'hair'. \n6. 'Skin' sounds vague to be used with lotion. Therefore, the better answer is 'body'. \n\nInput: What causes a person to break their finger? Choices: Finger is broken by an object A: rock B", "answer": "D: talking nonsense"}
{"text": "record is erasure.\nAnswer: C: erase\n\nInput: The kids have a school supply list. They do what about class? Choices:  School Supply List A: buy everything they need for school B: decide how they will help pay C: choose their clothes D: get in trouble E: decide what food they will eat\nRationales: In the instruction, the question is about class, the location where the children go. The text is referring to the specific action regarding school children.\n1. \"Buy everything they need for school\" is only an implication of something else.\n2. The kids do not decide how they will help on paying the school supplies, that is the parents responsibility.\n3. The kids do decide what food they will be eating, but that has nothing to do with school.\n4. Lastly, the kids do decide their clothes only if they have to. This is not implied from the text as it doesn't mention clothes being a requirement in the class.\n5. As a result, the most fitting choice is deciding what food they will eat.\nAnswer: D, the kids do what about class is Deciding what food they will be eat.\n\nInput: She works at the convenience store, where does she work? Choices:  In the convenience store A: kitchen B: supermarket C: grocery D: service E: office\nRationales: The instruction is about convenience store, and convenience store is a place. The question is related to the job of a single person working the convenience store.\n1. The workers at the service station cannot be working in the grocery since the grocery is not inside the convenience store.\n2. Likewise, the workers at the grocery store does not work in the convenience store since the convenience store is not a supermarket, it is a convenience store.\n3. The store assistant might be working in a kitchen inside the convenience store, but this is not stated in the text and this answer option is not among the choices for the given constraints.\n4. The person who works at the convenience store is working at the service station.\n5. The question \"where does she work\" asks where the person in the question is working, thus we can conclude that the correct answer is A: kitchen.\nAnswer: C, The choice to answer where it works is in the convenience", "answer": "C: deafness"}

{"text": "record is'rewrite'.\nAnswer: A: compact disc\n\nInput: When making soup, which part do they take? Choices:  a: chicken b: bones c: feet d: head e: giblets\nRationales:  1. Start the analysis by analyzing each of the given choices.\n2. a: chicken, b: bones, c: feet, d: head and e: giblets are all parts of a chicken.\n3. Out of these choices, we can cross out the two words that does not belong to chicken - giblets and head.\n4. Then, we can focus our attention on the choices, chicken, bones, feet, and head.\n5. As per the options, chicken is a whole and not a part.\n6. Now, bones will not fit here since bones can be part of chicken or the whole.\n7. We consider feet, and from the given definition, feet can be seen as part of chicken, so it can fit here in terms of choices from which one must select.\n8. Similarly, we consider the option 'head' and it fits here in terms of choices.\n9. Therefore, the answer choices can be narrowed down to feet and head.\n10. Out of the two choices, head fits more appropriately in terms of definitions for an option here.\n11. The question asks whether the part is taken while making soup and 'head' is included as an option.\n12. There are ways you can cook chicken to put into soup, but the question does not mention a particular recipe type. Thus, we take the answer to be 'head' because it is the most general part of a chicken that can be made into soup.\n\nAnswer: E: giblets\n\nInput: What material usually requires oil to be used?

Choices: \n\n1) Not applicable \n2) Money given \n3) Polite behavior \n4) Free food \n5) Reciprocate \n6) Tip \n\nRationales:\n1) Not applicable\n2) Choice (2)\n3) Choice (3)\n4) Choice (4)\n5) Choice (5)\n6) Choice (6)\n\n3. The question is based on an analogy and asks about the reason someone may be expected to act in a polite manner.\n4. When we consider the context and the alternatives, we can find that 'Polite behavior' and 'Free food' are the most closely matched. \n5. 'Tip' is not related, even though it is a kind of compensation. Likewise, 'Reciprocate' is also not relevant to the question. \n6. 'Money given' and 'Restaurant receipt' are also not options that could result in 'Polite behavior'. \n7. It seems that 'Free food' is the most suitable option.\n8. The phrase 'being served' is often used to describe being served food at a restaurant, and it's clear that servers usually expect to be rewarded with tips or polite behavior after serving customers, as it is part of their job.\n9. Therefore, 'Free food' is a correct answer.\nAnswer E: Free food\n\nInput: When will you tell a lie to get out? Choices: 1) When you need to 2) On your phone 3) At work 4) Never 5) In a foreign country\nRationales: The question asks about a time when someone may tell a lie. \n1. \"When you need to\" can't be a time, when should you lie?\n2. \"On phone\" is not necessarily a type of tell a lie, it only involves lie\n3. \"At work\" is not a time\n\nSo the only one left is \"Never\"\nAnswer: B: Never\n\nInput: What did the person use before and after the toothbrush?

{"text": "record is 'trying to erase a part of history'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: Which would you be doing if you wanted to increase the size of a book page number? Choices:  C: reorganize D: resize E: edit F: edit font\nRationales: The question asks about the action that a person would take so as to increase the size of the page number within a book.\n1. One option to be considered is 'edit', which refers to a process of changing data and modifying existing features.\n2. However, this type of editing will not increase the size of the existing page number, but could lead to new features, such as 'font' changes.\n3. Another option is'resize', which refers to adjusting an object's size or scale without changing its proportions in relation to other objects.\n4. In this case, it is less likely that one would resize the page number, but would rather edit the formatting.\n5. 'Rework' refers to doing something again, or making a repetition, but it is not directly related to modifying page numbers.\n6. 'Edit font' refers to a particular action that would alter the font type of a page, but not its size.\n7. Considering the available options, the most relevant option which could be doing to increase the size of page numbers within a book is 'editing the formatting'.", "answer": "A: pass water"}

{"text": "record is'rewrite' or 'erase' which alludes to cover up some aspect of history.\n7. The term 'compact disc' and 'tape' are generally associated with recording a particular song or moment or storing music, which would not fit with the act of burning a particular record.\n8. Similarly, 'play music' can be used with or without the act of burning a thing, so it doesn't really refer to an intention that involves burning something.\n9. 'Headache' also doesn't necessarily link to the intention to burn a record, so it's not a proper answer.\n10. Therefore, the correct answer option is either D: play music or E: erase.\nAnswer: D or E\n\nInput: She is using her phone in which location?

Choices: * A: baby * B: parent * C: scientist * D: child * E: teacher\nRationales: * A: baby: Babies generally aren't the first to see floating objects. They would generally observe objects around them, so they wouldn't necessarily be the first to see it. * B: parent: Parents could potentially see floating objects, however, they'll notice it after someone else first sees it or they'll see it in a different way, so they aren't the first one to see it. * C: scientist: Scientists specialize in looking for patterns and detecting anomalies so they can discover more. They would see floating objects for this purpose so they could notice them first.

{"text": "record is 'erasing' and 'trying to cover up'.\n7. Consequently, 'erase' and 'trying cover up history' are the best option choices here to complete the question.\nAnswer: B. Erase. E. Cover up history.\n\nInput: Which type of person would buy a clock, choose all that apply. Choices:  A. Student B. Grandparent  C. Traveler D. Child E F. Artist G. Businessperson H. Senior I. Parent\n\nRationales: The question uses an analogy relating to a clock. The question asks about a person fitting the definition of student. \n\n1. To understand this situation, we need to evaluate alternative 'A. Student' and determine the most fitting description that matches the meaning of'student'.\n2. A student is generally an educated individual who is actively developing knowledge.\n3. In this case, a student is someone who is looking for a new purchase. \n4. A student would likely be looking for a new place or means to store or hold the clock since they are not necessarily looking for a new clock in the literal sense.\n5. In this case, student means someone who is looking for new things or wanting to keep track of time.\n6. This is not associated with 'child' since children are generally not yet of the age in which they are actively engaged in the learning process. \n7. Also, children can't purchase items from stores and don't really 'own' their own time.\n8. Similarly, 'parent' is also not a good fit since parents don't really look for 'time' management or 'new items'; they are typically involved in the opposite.\n9. In any case, all the options can be disregarded since none of them match the given phrase.\n10. Next, we examine the available alternatives that most clearly define the question scenario.\n11. It is evident that 'travelers' may purchase a clock because they need to keep track of time and places.\n12. Additionally, since a traveler would often be looking for new or interesting items; 'artist' would also be a fitting choice.\n13. Thus, it is best to choose both 'traveler' and 'artist'.\n14. In order to answer the question, choose alternative 'C. Traveler'", "answer": "C: despair"}

The dog is very hungry \nRationales: The dog will not eat the food because we are thinking of the animal and the food is toxic for the dog and it may die if it eats it. So the dog will not eat it.

Choices: \nA: to stay with friends\nB: to see next movie\nC: to get free drink\nD: to watch commercials\nE: to go to snack stand\nRationales:\n1. The question is asking why people still spend time at the movie theatre after each movie has ended, and one possible reason they do it is because of nostalgia.\n2. The remaining answers aren't connected to the stated goal.\n3. The only action that seems to be related to the ending of a movie is the desire to see the next movie, which is option B.\n4. In contrast to this, the other action does not seem to be goal related as they are more closely related to the start of the movie. For example, if someone likes to go to snacks afterward, it's likely they only do so at the start of a movie.\n5. Option D could be a reasonable explanation of why someone may want to spend time at the movie theater, but it isn' t directly related as it's more of a generalization than a reason for specific goal. \n6. The most correct answer is option B, which is the best reason to go to movie theater after a film has ended.\nAnswer: B. to see next movie\n\nInput: Are you familiar going shopping?

This option is not related to getting money off your debit card.\n\nOption 2: buying things online is not the same as \"getting money\" off your debit card, as buying things online does not directly get you money out of your account. However, one would use \"add money to account\" in this context as one would add money to the debit card account by purchasing stuff online.\n\nOption 3: Transfer Funds has some relation to getting money from the debit card. It is where money is moved between one's bank and one's bank account. This option could be a potential valid answer.\n\nOption 4: Paying bills is again not a relevant choice, as one is not paying bills with a debit card (only credit cards can be used for bills).\n\nOption 5: Buying stuff online could be a suitable answer, as purchasing stuff online would most likely require adding money to the account and also it is not related to purchasing stuff through a credit card.\n\nOption: Option 6: Call an ATM might be an answer that is possible. If one went to this ATM with an account and debit card, one could access one's money. This option however is potentially vague as it could be a \"cardless\" ATM rather than one who requires cards.\n\nOption 7: Asking someone for money could be related to using your debit card, however the debit card is not the item that being given.

This suggests it is better to reject this option. \n\n* B: fridge: if fridge is part of kitchen, then that would be a good choice. A fridge, or refrigerator, is an appliance used for cooling and preserving food. So,'milk for the fridge' would be logical. But, this is not an option provided in the question, so it is eliminated. \n\n* C: storage room: If'storage room' is a place that is part of kitchen, it might be a good choice. Since this option is not provided it is eliminated.\n\n* D: stove: if'stove' is part of kitchen, this would also be a good option. However this is not provided as an option so it is eliminated from consideration.\n\n* E: bathroom: 'bathroom' would be a good option. It doesn't have any other meaning in this sentence and it's not contradicted in the question so this is the only option remaining. \n\n* Based on the above analysis, we can confirm that the answer choice is 'bathroom'.\nAnswer: C.\n\nInput: You get hurt when you do what?

{"text": "physical record is \"rewrite history\", as this phrase means intentionally or unintentionally changing or covering over what occurred in the past.\nAnswer: D_rewrite history\n\nInput:  A: dad B: bicycle C: child D: chocolate E: clothing\n\nRationales: First step is to understand the context based on some logic of how the sentences should be read. For example:\n\n1. A: dad \u2013 The first sentence in the choice is in present, so A fits because it has dad.\n2. B: bicycle \u2013 Same process and since C is also in present, we need to add a relative pronoun or another verb. Since B also uses dad, it should be in past, so B fits.\n3. C: child \u2013 Since C also uses dad so it should also be in passive voice.\n\nThus, answer to this question can either be C or A because they both uses dad and are in past tense.\n\n4.D: child- it's present tense. The answer should be either A or D.\n5. E: clothing \u2013 The choice is still in present tense. Since E uses relative pronoun, the pronoun is clothing, not child. Thus, it implies that this choice should be in 3rd person, not 2nd person as all of the options use. Also, the choice talks about a present situation, so it should be in present tense and there's no verb, so it should be a noun.\nThus, the answer is A, since it uses past tense, has been used, and uses dad.\nAnswer: C: child\n\nInput: The child asked for a toy, where did they ask? Choices: 3. A: dad B. C: outside C. daddy's room\n\nRationales:(If you were to write the sentence 3, dad would be D instead of B because it matches the pattern, and child is also C. These are examples of how to write sentences that match the pattern)\n\n1. The first sentence uses first person and is in present tense. That means that B would be true since it uses first person and is also in present tense.\n2. To add complexity, we need to think about this a bit more before making a choice.", "answer": "C: late"}

Choices: \n\nA: long and shorter from a different fabric\n\nB: shorter and longer fabric\n\nC: fabric\n\nD: dress\n\nE: different fabric\n\nRationales: A, B, C, or E are irrelevant here. A person can have dresses of different lengths, and different materials.\n\nAnswer E indicates that you would prefer dresses constructed from different materials (e.g., silk and cotton). So if E would be the answer, the long dress would have originally been constructed from the new material, while the shorter dress would be constructed from the original material.\n\nAnswer D indicates the opposite. You would prefer dresses constructed with the same material, thus the long dress is constructed of the original material, while the shorter one is constructed from the different material.\n\nTherefore, B would be the correct answer.\n\nAnswer D: fabric\n\nInput: What type of person would take the job if their first experience being a teacher was teaching their mother a foreign language?

This indicates that the candidates will be narrowed down to either a parent or their own partner.\n\nAnswer B would describe a teacher and this candidate would take the job based on their teaching experience. This does not apply though, as it would take an insane person to teach their mother a foreign language.\n\nAlso, any person who took the job would definitely be qualified to teach a foreign language.\nAn answer of A describes a student, which means they have had experience but not necessarily with teaching their mom a language.\n\nAnswers A and B", "answer": "E: bus stop"}

Also, a tree has no space for a cat to sit.\n\nD: a cat nest is also not an ideal fit as it's not a cat's usual location, and nests are usually used to build homes. \n\nE: a cat nest does not fit the scenario as a cat's typical location is not a room.

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: How can you make sure you are keeping safe? Choices:  a) bake a cake c) clean the dirt d) wash the table e) set the fire f) water the plants\nRationales:\n1. The question asks how to keep safe. Safety may be maintained in different ways and by undertaking different actions on different objects, such as the things mentioned in the choices.\n2. 'Keep safe,' as a concept, could be associated with each of the 5 options; therefore, it's not necessary to eliminate any choice.\n3. 'Bake a cake' can be seen as a figurative or symbolic act as food is something a person can eat, while to 'bake a cake' means to cook food in an oven, and usually, baking involves an element of risk/reward.\n4. Likewise, to 'clean the dirt' refers to something literal and metaphorically represents removing something from an environment.\n5. 'Wash the table' could be considered a figurative act as washing does not only mean cleaning, but it can also be used to remove or eliminate something metaphorically.\n6. 'Set the fire' refers to something literal, and 'water the plants' similarly to 'wash the table' is a figurative act as watering usually does not mean just pouring water on plants.\n7. The two figurative choices stand out, but'set the fire' is more aligned with the actions in the other choices, which makes it a plausible option as well. In addition, the other choices don't provide clear, detailed reasoning and analysis.\n8. The choices seem to have a few figurative elements to them by definition, but the act of setting a fire, cooking a cake, cleaning the dirt, and watering the plants could be reasonably associated with making or keeping safe. \n9. This leaves us with'set the fire' and 'water the plants'. \n10. The best choice is 'waterm the plants' because \"watering the plants\" can be seen to mean keeping or caring for the plants which could relate to keeping or making yourself safe.\nAnswer: D-: wash the table\n\n### Demostration:\nIf", "answer": "A: pet store"}

'Erase' would generally only apply to something that is supposed to get removed and not something you are destroying, in this case burning is actually destroying the record.\n8.

Choices: \nA: tenant \nB: the owner \nC: guard \nD: butler \nE: handyman \n\nRationales: As it seems from the question the most appropriate answer is the one, who would go and visit your house every day to check and make sure all the things are in good order, the answer to this is \"handyman\". Although \"tenant\" and \"the owner\" also sound plausable, however, the answer choice, \"handyman\" clearly seems to be the one who would be likely to care most about your house.\n\nAnswer: D: handyman\n\nInput: What's the difference between a house and a home? Choices: 1. A: ownership \nB: place \nC: furniture \nD: room \nE: roof \n\nRational for answers : The difference between a house and what can be regarded as a home is ownership for a house is a bit different to owning a home. Ownership of a house is a bit more passive (e.g. you might own one house but that does not mean that house is your home). Owning a home is more active- it is what is usually regarded the more significant signifier of residency. So it is probably better to talk about homeowners than house owners because the latter suggests that they might still live in other people\u2019s homes.\n\nAnswer: A: ownership\n\nInput:What did the woman put in a box, on Saturday, to send out on Monday?

Choices: 0: that shoe will fall apart 1: you are going to get cuts and bruises 2: that shoe will not be able to walk 3: you'll never walk correctly 4: you will lose some toe\nRationales: The question asks what would be the consequences of wearing a shoe made of glass, that is, why not to buy a shoe of glass?\n\nStep 1: Break the question in question tags.\n\nStep 2. Analyse each choice on their own basis, so as to disregard what other choices say.\n\nStep 1. 0: that shirt will fall apart\n\nStep 2.'That shoe will fall apart' means that the shoe will break (fall apart) if and when one will be wearing it.\n\nStep 7. 2: that shirt will not be able to perform\n\nStep 7.'That shirt will not be performing' means that it will not be able to act, move and do things one has expected it to do.\n\nStep 9. 3: you will never walk correctly\n\nStep 9.'You will never walk correctly' means that you will never be able to walk as you had expected or had planned to walk.\n\nStep 0. 4: you will always lose some toe\n\nStep 10.'You will always lose some toe' means that you will constantly be losing a toe, meaning that you will lose one each time you wear the shoe (and not only that one time) or when you wear the shoe. It has no connection to the rest of the choices, as this is a new thought and should not be confused with other choices.\n\nStep0.'What if you were using a glass shoe?' and 'What if you were wearing a shoe that is not made of glass?' could also be choices.\n\nStep1.'What will you get if you buy a glass shoe?'

Choices:  Coco puff A: breakfast B: dinner C: lunch D: dessert E: snack\nRationales: For this choice, the question is using an example to test the comprehension and understanding of a speaker.\n1. Each option includes the term coco puffs. Since each option includes the same specific words and items, the test will be related to that specific item and not the context of dinner/lunch/dessert (as those are not mentioned or used as a part of the answer choice).\n2. The two 'coco puff items' are not the foods associated with the phrase 'breakfast/lunch/snack/dinner,' rather they both indicate a type of cereal and puffed rice snack.\n3. The two items are the same, but one is a type of breakfast cereal while the other is considered a type of dessert. The question is worded so that the answer will be one of the two items, and the key to identifying the answer will be to comprehend and understand the wording.\n4. From this, we can deduce that the answer will be related to the phrase the person is describing/using. \n\nInput: They are wearing ________, who is looking at the clock? Choices: A: bones B: beetles C: beds D: bracelets E: brains F: bells G: beans\nRationales: This test question utilizes the context of the whole scenario to provide a word that is relevant in the context. The question is asking what a group of people are thinking about. The word ________ is the best option available given context.\n1.

Choices: A: in front of the window B: in the back C: near the stairs D: in front of the door E: near the window\nRationales: The question asks for a possible reason for standing up with pain instead of simply sitting down.\n\nConsider the provided choices:\n\n1. A: in front of window could imply that there's a window behind the employee who is suffering from pain.\n\n2. B: in the back could indicate that the person is sitting away from other employees who are talking to the boss.\n\n3. C: near the stair is implying that the person has difficulty walking.\n\n4. D: in front of door indicates that the person is likely near an exit when they stand.\n\n5. E: near window might imply sitting in the shade while feeling their pain.\n\n6.

B: flowers 3. C: wallet 4. D: chocolate 5. E: pen\nRationales: In options A: socks, the word 'what' does not refer to the item but rather the person who may receive the item.\n\nIn options B: flowers, the word 'what can be interpreted to refer to either the person who is having the flowers as a gift or to the flowers given as a gift. This answer is implied in the given sentence but is not the correct answer.\n\nIn options C: wallet, the question asks which item can have someone buy a gift. A wallet is not an item that a person could buy as a gift.

Only a handful\nRationales: (1) \"None\" in this problem refers to any number equal to or less than zero, which is equivalent to a blank answer option. We can eliminate it and move to the following options. \n(2) The word \"more\" refers to a number equal to or greater than fourteen. \n(3) The use of \"twelve\" and \"plus\" as the first two digits implies that the second two digits (e.g., \"plus three\" would mean that the number is at least sixteen) must be greater than seven. We know that flutes are usually made of wood. Thus, we can eliminate this choice because wood can't be over seven feet (2.133 m) tall. \nThis is not to say that wood can't be more than 7 ft tall, but to determine which of the remaining options makes sense for the answer. So, we can eliminate this as well. \n(4) \"At least 2\" is a combination of \"at least\" and a number. The number \"2\" is not a reasonable number of people playing the flute. And, we know that it can't be as few as \"zero\" because \"zero\" is not a real part of the set of the integers. Therefore, we can also eliminate this option. \n(5) We know that the flute is at least seven (or at most, 7.29 m) in height and is made of wood, so wood can't be equal to or greater than fifteen. By the same reasoning as with option 3, we can eliminate this.\nAnswer: None of the other four options, because wood cannot be over 7 ft tall.\n\nInput: How much is a pound? Choices: 5. One dollar 6.

Choice number 2 has two incorrect words and the sentence did not say that the pencil had an 'amount' or 'quantity' of lead so we can eliminate that choice. Choice number 3 has one incorrect word and the sentence doesn't mention anything about the pencil being sharp so we can eliminate it.

Choices:  V: the lighting was bad A: he didn't look good B: he was unprepared C: he could afford the best D: he didn't try hard E: you were prejudiced\nRationales: We can see from the question that they were judging a competition and the question is asking why first prize was awarded even though the winner was unable to see the result.\n\nBased on the context, the first clue is that 'the lighting was bad'. \n\n'Bad lighting' can be interpreted as insufficient light to see the result clearly.

If the winner was able to afford the best, it would not matter whether they could see the result.\nThis clue is also a red herring.\n\nThe fourth clue is that the candidate 'was prejudice'. Being prejudice does not mean that someone cannot see a thing. Prejudice can potentially be a way to prevent someone from seeing something, but it is not a direct obstacle to be able to see the result. Therefore, the clue is also a red-herring.\n\n'The winner was unprepared' and 'The winner was prejudice' are possible causes, however they are both still red herrings and can be eliminated. They wouldn't have affected whether the winner could see the result.   \n\n'He could afford the best' is also a possible reason, but this is indirectly related to the result, which would allow the person to see.

Taking up residence is staying in one place, but it doesn't necessarily describe a situation where someone is staying with family.\n2. Building a home is typically not something someone would do over the summer.\n3. Doing homework refers to school, which isn't particularly relevant to the given context of the question. \n4. Watching a movie is not a summer undertaking.\n5. Relaxing is certainly something someone could do in the summer, but is not necessarily a choice of activity with family. \n\nAs a result, the correct answer is 4: 'doing homework'\n\nAnswer: C: doing homework\n\nInput: What might you wear if it's wet?

So, the answer is choice C: the student.\n\nWith our answer, we can now rule out all other choices.\n\nOption B, the staff, doesn't make sense because it's unlikely staff members ever receive awards, and we aren't talking about staff members here at all.\n\nOption E, the principal, is also impossible because the principal rarely gives awards to students, and the one receiving the award is a student in question.\n\nOption A, the person, doesn't have much of a chance either since we already know it's the student in question.\nOptions H and E can be eliminated. \n\nWith our analysis clear, the best option is D, the student.\n\nAnswer: D: student\n\nInput: The bicycle owner is riding, who were the possible passenger(s)?

Choices:  D: screaming B: dancing C: partying D: playing games\nRationales: The key for successfully completing this question is to look at how the options were grouped. This helps you determine what they may relate to.\n\nStep 1: The first option,'scaring', is a verb used to describe when a person is frightened.\n\nStep 2. The second option, 'playing games', is a noun. It refers to activities like video games, board games, and other games.\n\nStep 7. Now, we can eliminate the first two options from the choices.\n\n'Dancing' is a verb (action) not the thing that people are doing while wearing a clowns costume (action). \n\n'Partying' is a noun (act). It does not describe what one wearing a costume is doing. \n\nStep. 3. Let's move on to the third option: 'partying'.\n\nAs with the second option, we can eliminate this phrase since it doesn't describe the action that one wearing a costumes is doing. \nThis left us with 'playing games'.\n\nStep 4. Now, it's time to eliminate two of the remaining options: B and C.\n\nStep 9. Our list has boiled down to two options: playing games and partying. We evaluate which one is linked closely to the act of wearing a a clown costumes during Halloween. \n\nStep: 5.

It is possible to walk on roads but also to walk on roads in temperate climates than on ones in cold climates.\nD: walk on roads is a likely choice for a city near a mountain. You may or may not take breaks, however it may be necessary to take them to avoid exhaustion when in cold climates. \nE: walk early is a likely choice for the morning especially in a mountain-city.

Choices: 1.A: a comb 2.B: hairbrush 3.C: shampoo 4.D: washing machine 5.E: hose\nRationales: The question is asking about what was probably using water after being in a tub. \nWe are given five options:\n1. A comb (uses water to clean hair)\n2. Hairbrush (washing or grooming)\n3. Shampoo (uses water for cleaning and moisturizing the hair)\n4. Washing Machine (uses water for washing clothes)\n5. Hose (water comes from a faucet or tap)\n\nBy the contextual information in the sentence, a comb is unlikely because they would not have put water in a comb. \nSince a person is in a tub and a tub is a type of shower in the United States, the person taking a shower is more likely. Hence a washing machine is unlikely.\n\nAs this is a shower, it is most reasonable for the person to use shampoo since it is a hair care product. \n\nSimilarly it is very likely that the person is using hair brush and using some water to clean hair.\n\nOnly hair brush and shampoo are most relevant in this case.\n\nAnswer: \nC: shampo\n\nInput: What can you use to store toys?

Each of the given choices is an option available to a person as a response to this sign.\n2. 'Go information' is the name of the department at a train station or similar public facility that provides timetables, schedules and other ticket-related information.\n3. 'Go back' could mean returning to previous place or going back in time with the sign. However, this is not what needs to be done after getting a train ticket.\n4.

Analyze the question and eliminate all choices that cannot be used to describe what one would expect the customer to buy after the food is a type of sauce.\n2. Evaluate if any of the choices can correctly predict what one can conclude the customer would buy.\n\nStep 1: Examine what the choices stand for, A: meat, B: seafood, C: veggies, D: tomato sauces, E: barbecue.\n\nStep 2. Analyze that most of these choices could not be 'food' as they are not directly related to describing a meal.\n\nStep 7 Choice A,'meat' means that it is a type of meat you buy in a grocery store. It is not a sauce.\n\nStep 9 Choice B,'seafood', means fish and other types of seafood. It is not a type of sauce either.\n\nStep 0. Choice C,'veggies', is a term in the grocery market that refers to vegetables and fruits.

Choices:  a: start b: end c: repeat d: add e: change\nRationales: The question asks for the 'option B' that the employee \"needs to do\".\n1. The first thing to note is that there are two types of options: A, the first choice of things that can be done, and B, the second choice of things that can also be done after the first one.\n2. There are two 'answers that need to be done' but it is not stated what exactly the employee needs to do, rather it is stated that they'should do' one of them.\n3. If they leave their work alone, they'should' do something.\n4. There are a total of 6 possible options so we should consider all of them.\n5. First let's consider D, 'change' - the employee might change something else instead which would involve something about work, but this choice is not good.\n6. Let's now look at option E, 'add'. Adding a part or pieces of work is a similar action, however, it is not associated solely with the idea of leaving work 'alone'.\n7. If A or B were good, the employees who 'left their work' would have to add something to make things consistent and/or cover their mistakes.\n8. Therefore the best option is still option B: changing, revising the work done previously.\n9. This option is the most similar to the idea of 'leaving your work alone', yet still it includes an action which could be considered as'making it better'.\nAnswer: B: change\n\nInput: If it is your birthday, you were celebrating it in what?

The question: \"How can it be explained?\" asked and requires us to determine which of the listed choices best correlates (relates or links) to the night dream concept.\n2. We have to eliminate the choices until we find the answer. \"Not true\" and \"False\" both contradicts the concept.\n3. \"A dream\" does not explain anything because it is not a \"concept\" but a \"word.\"\n4. \"Reality\" seems to connect to the concept but does not explain it.\n5.

Choices: \n A: vegetables B C: can D E: drawers F G: box H I: shovel J K: pantry L M: storage N: bag O P: garden\nRationales: To start, it's worth noting that there is no direct or obvious link between the store and either 'carrots' or 'carrot'. The question has given us the image of a vegetable store but then asks how to store the carroots. Although the correct answer will connect the two questions and images, we can eliminate answer choices that are far removed from this connection and those that are too general. \n \nFor example,'vegetables' is not helpful because it's not a specific type of store nor is it an item of storage. Also, it only includes one of the two items in the question. \n \n'B: can' is also a possible choice, but you might not usually store carrots in a can. Instead, a can might hold condiments that are used on carrots while they are being eaten. We can also reject 'C: drawers' because they are used only for storing items of clothing, not vegetables. \n \nAs we continue, 'D: bag' is unlikely to be considered a legitimate option as 'bag' doesn't suggest anything we can use to put the vegetables or carrots in. In fact, bags are usually used to carry the vegetables not to store them. \n \nWe can conclude that the items 'A: vegetables', 'D: bag', and 'E: drawers' are all invalid. 'G: box' is a possible choice. Boxes can be used to store vegetables; however, there is probably not a very specific box for storage. If it were the right answer, it would be easy to explain which box. It would also be possible to find another question with the same two images (vegetable seller and carrots) but instead ask how to keep a vegetable. \n Finally, 'J: pantry' refers to a special place where food is kept as well as other items.

Choices: A: in lake B: in puddles C: in rain D: in ocean E: in winter\nRationales:  1. Understanding the premise of the passage is critical for answering this question. \n2. It states the speaker is looking for water. \n3. Thus, it is unclear if the speaker will find water from whereever it is currently. From that perspective, any suitable place to find water can be an answer. \n4. But the meaning of the question refers to water on land, as opposed to in air or sea. \n5. In that context, we can eliminate any options referring to water in air or sea (A: in lake B:in ocean). \n6. Also, an option referring to water in winter, (E: in winter) wouldn't be relevant, because it would be too cold to wear rubber boots at that time.\n7. The other three options can still be considered since they refer to specific places: (B: in puddle), (D: in rain), & (C: in rain). \n8. However, since in each of the options, the water comes from the rain, they are referring to water in a common place where rain or precipitation occurs. \n9.

We can rule out the first option.\n5. Option b: shape is probably meant to be included if the answer is c: color. Since there's no shape in carpets and rugs, we can eliminate this choice.\n6. Option c: color and d: form can't be eliminated because color and form are both attributes of these items.\n7. We can eliminate e: size\n8.

{"text": "record is'rewrite'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: What are the things a person probably isn't looking for? Choices:  B: carpet C: chess D: game show host E: chess player\nRationales: Considering the choices, a person who searches for things might or might not be searching for a carpet. Since a carpet and a chess board are both floorings, it is unclear whether \"carpet\" is what is specifically being ruled out.\n\nIf the question asked \"a person searching for thing probably isn't looking at carpet\", the right answer should be \"carpet\".\n\nA game show host and a chess game player are obviously different people from what a person is searching for. Therefore, the questions doesn't use these alternatives to rule out a \"person looking for things\" also being a person searching for a game show host or a chess player.\n\nThese three points make E, \"a chess player\" or \"game show host\", the most appropriate answer from the given options.\n\nAnswer: E: chess player or game show host\n\nInput: Did the person try to use an ice cube to fix a problem? Choices:  C: break in the water pipe D: stop the pain E: cool the burn F: stop the leakage\nRationales: The person may have tried to use an ice cube on \"the problem\" (a burn or something). They may have been trying to fix the problem or prevent it (break in the water pipe). So they may not have tried to use the ice cube on the problem (stop the leakage). Now that we can rule out a majority of the answers, we are left with only 2. \n\nA burn is a problem, and the ice cube is a kind of pain reliever that might stop the problem. We can eliminate A (stop the burn) and B (the pain). But since burns can also be associated to a problem that caused a burn, we can also eliminate D (the leakage problem). We are left with the only possible answer - F.\n\nAnswer: F: stop the leak", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

Choices: 1.A, medium\n    2.B, small\n    3.C, large\n    4.D, extra small\n    5.E, extra large\nRationales: Consider the options available and what the question asks.\n\nStep 1: Look at each of the options.\n\nStep 2. Evaluate each option.\n\nStep    3. Ask yourself if the options answer the question.\n\nStep \t4. If not, eliminate the options.\n\nRationales\n\nStep  1\n\nOptions A and C can be eliminated as options that deal with sizes. The question asks about a person who wants to know the size they need. As a result, the options that only give information about what size to buy are not in accordance with the question.\n\nOption D, extra small is not a valid size as the choices should be limited to the sizes medium, small, large, and extra large.\n\nOption E, extra large can be ruled out because the question asks for a specific size that the customer wants to know. Extra large would be providing the opposite of the answer the customer wants, which is the size they need to buy.\n\nOption B, small has to be the only alternative that fits the question and can be given as the answer.\n\n   Rationales\n\nStep 2\n\nOption A, medium can be removed because according to step the options that provide information only about sizes can be removed from the list.\n\nStep \n\t3\n\nCheck whether the remaining three options still answer the question.

Choices: \nA: kitchen B: bathroom C: garage D: bathroom sink E: kitchen sink\nRationales:\n1. There is a difference between 'A - wet'-bathroom, and the others 'wet'-kitchen sink and garage.\n2. We could further analyze each choice and compare to the question. The bathroom and kitchen sinks are usually where liquid is present. Bathrooms often have showers and bathtubs, whereas the kitchen might have a sink. \n3. 'Kitchen' and 'Bathroom' is an easy choice as these are specific rooms in a house or establishment.\n4. The word 'garage' can be related to the question if one thinks of it as a place to park a car. But, in this case, it's unlikely that the \"place\" in question refers to the inside of a garage.\n5.

Clothing can be worn with any shirt color or style.\n2. Color options are very subjective but are more unique than clothing.\n3. Style is more unique than clothes, but it is often associated with clothing.\n4. Fabric is a unique choice, as there are many types of fabrics to choose from.\n5. While any of the four choices are valid, of them, the most unique is fabric, which can be evaluated as the best fit for a new shirt purchasing choice.\nAnswer: D fabric\n\nInput: Which one are two times harder than a metal bar used in tools? Choices:\nA: nail  B: string  C: hair  D: bone  E: rope\nRationales: Each of the choices is difficult. We have to choose the most difficult one.\n\n1. Nails are pretty strong but are not necessarily twice as strong as a metal bar.\n2. Strings are not usually made of metal.\n3. Hair is not rigid, it is very fluffy, and it can cause much pain when it gets pulled out and gets scratched.\n4. Bones can't be pulled out, but we can use them to scratch hard things including metal.\n5. The strongest and hardest one should be a choice for metal bars.\n6.

Choices  A: retailer B: wholesaler C: individual D: consumer E: vendor\nRationales:  1. This questions uses business vocabulary, and the question asks about the types that the business can operate under.\n2. The provided options describe different business situations and models.\n3. There are two primary types of businesses which can be identified from the choices: Retailer, which is the first business type, and Wholesaler, which is the second.\n4. In retailers, the business sells goods to the end-user consumer, which allows the shop owner to stock whatever shelves he/she wants as the customer is going to buy them.\n5. In a wholesaler, he/she will instead source different items from the retailer, purchasing large quantities of items and selling them individually by the unit.\n6. Because retailers sell to end-users and wholesalers do not, a retailer can theoretically have much more control over his/her shelf selection. An individual cannot be a 'type' of seller as it's not a singular entity to which the term'seller' is attached to.\n7. 'Consumer' can only buy shelves, not sell them. Thus, 'consumer' doesn't match up as a choice.\n8. 'Vendor' may or may not actually describe an option that can purchase shelves; however, that's not specifically how a'vendor' is defined by business terms.\n9. 'Individual' will likely only be able to purchase 1 shelf, which doesn't make sense for the context, so the best option is A: retailer, which describes the type of business that can have the most control over the shelves.\nAnswer: A. retailer\n\nInput: When is the last time he went to a movie that involved people that do what for a job?

In the question, C. Erase can be an answer for what they wanted to do with their record: erase the history.\n\n### Hints:\n\n1. The option A, Compact disc, can mean that it is a type of disc (DVD, CD, etc). However, the question is looking for something else: what they are trying to do with their record. Compact disc is just their medium; it is not an action.\n\n2. The option B, Tape, can mean that it might be just like a cassette tape. However, the question is just asking about what they did with their record. The record is burned to erase history.\n\n3. The option C, Erase might be something like deleting a video in your computer. However, the question only asks what they want to do with their record, not what they want to do in the program. The record is burn to erase history.

E) a coat\nRationales: A Pinafore can be either a dress or a jacket both are worn in different ways to cover. So, any options can match the choice and be correct as well.\n\nIf she is wearing a dress, the choice will describe the dress worn by her. If she is wearing a shirt, the choice will describe her shirt.\nIf she is weaing a jacket, the choice will describe either her jacket or a pinafore describing the jacket. If she is weaing coat, the choice will describe a coat.\n\nIf we can't tell if she is wearing a jacket or not, then it is most likely to be a jacket.\n\nThe given clues are \"A woman\" and \"This is a woman\"\n\nSo, this shows us that it could be woman, dress or jacket.\n\nChoice 4 is Dress \" A dress; as, the fashionable dress of the day.\"\n\nso, Choice 2 or 3 might be correct.\n\nHowever, the choice describes pinafore. So, it is not a dress rather than a jacket.\nA jacket is not worn by a woman in India.

A) A new year - does not describe a chance to do something.\n3. A) I see an ad for a new car.\n4.

A: power off\nRationales: The question presents a problem faced by a person trying to restart their vehicle, specifically the engine.\n\n1. The first choice, 'A: turn off', is a reasonable option that could be chosen to solve the problem.\n\n2. The second choice, 'A: restart', is also an option that makes sense as trying to turn on the vehicle again could potentially result in a fresh start.\n\n3. Next, we can cross out choice B: restart, as it is a repeation of choice A: restart and is redundant.\n\n4. Option C: power off is a potentially suitable option but needs to be evaluated further. Turning off the vehicle would also help and is a more intuitive solution.\n\n5. The final choice, D: power off, is again a potentially viable option since turning off the vehicle can also be referred to as 'powering off'.\n\n6. Now we have to return to choice A: turn off and consider option 1, 'power off' to be equivalent.\n7. Option 2, restart is already out of the question due to choice B which is a duplicate.\n8. That leaves us with choice 1: turn off which is an obvious choice as it can be done easily without special equipment.\n9. The answer is therefore, 'A: turnoff'. \nAnswer: A: turnoff\n\nInput: Where people do not have money, should invest?

There are many things we can do to invest in general, but here, we have to figure out options which can be considered as investment opportunities for people without money.\n2.

However, none fit the given context.\n\nThe context of the sentence suggests that there is a person who does not eat cupcakes. The options available are 'eat', 'add strawberries','slice it', 'frost a banana', and 'get sugar on its hands'. These options are common actions that can be performed on cupcakes, such as eating, adding strawberries, slicing, frosting a banana, and getting sugar on the person's hands.\n\nBut these actions are not exclusive or necessary actions performed when eating or using cupcakes.\n\nFor example, it is not necessary to get sugar on your hands when eating cupcakes.\nIn summary, the most fitting answer is 'get sugar on hands'.", "answer": "A: laugh"}

Pull it away 5. Throw it away\nRationales: A clue is that the options are all actions, all have verbs, and all have a clear subject and object. \n\nOption 3 is to cut something, so the subject would be \"I\". This one is ruled out. \n\nOption #4 \"Pull it away\" is not something I should be doing if I wear a coat, unless there is dirt or dust on me. The subject would be \"me\", so this one is eliminated. \n\nOption \"5\" is related to throwing something away, so the subject is that I (the person) throw something away, so this one is also eliminated. \nThe final answer is \"put it on\", because the subject is inanimate:  \"It\" is now on, so it is selected as the correct answer.\n\nInput: Why is it when you're flying you aren't allowed to talk? Choices:  X: it can cause damage to your ears X: it can make it noisier X: it can make communication unclear X: it may make it so people miss their stopping point X: you can't talk if you are flying\nRationales: The question states why it is prohibited to talk on a plane flight. We have to figure out the reason/circumstance behind this prohibition. First, we should examine the given statements and consider each based on which is most aligned with the topic of a flight. \n\nStatement X: \"It can cause damage to your ear\" does not necessarily mean you cannot talk on a plane or it can directly relate to the topic of a flight or communication with others while flying. Moreover, it is clearly related to sounds or loudness, not to flight or communication, so it is ruled out. 3.

Choices:  The rail is damaged. The engine has a problem. The tracks are wet. A train is too heavy. An object is stuck on the tracks.\nRationales:\n1. The question asks what causes a train's progress to be impeded.\n2. The answer is A: the tracks are wet. This is the only option that clearly fits with the reasoning.\n3. The other options may technically be possible causes of a train being delayed but they don't fit well within the context of our question.\n4. For example, having a problem with the engine or 'too heavy' doesn't necessarily account for a delay in the train's movement. They could cause the train to stop but not slow it down.\n5. In addition, it's unclear why the object stuck on the rail should slow the train. If no vehicles were on the rail, the train could move at full speed.\n\nInput: What do you receive once you find a lost item in a junk shop? Choices:  Money. A new lost item. An angry response.

We do not need to apologize to nobody, we need to apologize to somebody.\n\nOption B: 'The students'. The phrase 'the students' is referring to those who we were in the wrong with on the school bus.\n\nOption C: 'The driver'. The phrase 'the driver' refers to the person we were in the wrong against while on the school bus. \n\nOption D: 'No one'. In general, 'no one' would not be the correct or appropriate phrase to use. There is rarely a situation where we should apologize directly to 'no one'.\n\nOption E: 'The bus washers'.

Choices:  Pinky finger is found on  A: the right side of the hand B: the left of the hand C: top of the palm D: thumb side of the hand E: the backside of the hand\nRationales: Each option has a different reference point. \n\n1. A person looks to the right to find their left pinky and vice versa so A and B should be eliminated. \n\n2. D is similar to a person checking to see the thumb side of their hand. \n\n3.

Choice:  A: front B: rear C: middle D: top E: bottom\nRationales: Options A, B and E cannot be found on a car. This leaves Choices: C, D and E on the remaining options. \n\n1st Step: Since C is the middle we are still searching for the choice that the car\u2019s wheel can be found on, then we can eliminate this option and eliminate the options at hand.\n\n2nd Step: If top is used as a metaphor then it can be placed anywhere in the car and therefore this choice cannot be used.\n\n3rd Step: The car can either have one wheel or four, and hence Option E cannot be used.\n4th Step: There are generally front and rear wheels, and therefore Elimination of Option C and D leaves us with A and B.\n\n5th Step: Option A is the front of the car and B is the rear of the car. Since wheel is on the top of the car this indicates that car's wheel comes from options B (rear) and C (middle) and option A (front) doesn\u2019t have any wheel.\n\n6th", "answer": "B: table"}

It therefore needs to be considered first.\n\nStep2: Option 'B' is'meat'. \n\nStep3: Option 'A' is 'chicken'. Option 'A' can be a choice for the query. The answer to the question will be chicken in this case due to the option available in the given choices.\n\nStep4: Option 'C' is 'Bacon'. \n\nStep5: Option 'D' is 'pork'\n\nThe question requires us to choose a different choice other than the given. If we select 'B' or 'D', the question gets unsolvable due to the contradictions stated above.\n\nStep6: Option 'C', 'Bacon', can be selected as a suitable response which is exclusive.\n\nStep7: Option 'E' is 'eggs'.

Choices:  Hairy A: shave B: wash C: color D: cut E: groom\nRationales: Option A, hairy, in this question would be a specialist in a field who assists people.\nOption B can have several implications. Washing someone in order to help them is implying to wash something else. For example, washing a garment or a body part. But shaving someone is not washing.\nOption C, color, could mean several things which do not fit the context. For example, it could mean coloring one's hair, or changing the color of a person, place, or thing.\nOption D could refer to someone offering haircuts or hair-related advice, but doesn't directly connect to the question.\nOption E, groom, is not used in the question.\n\nOption A can mean two things.

Choices:  His desk A:  B: his shelf C:  his car\nRationales\nStep 1: Analyse the question. It asks us to deduce what the male looked at that may have caused his wife to get angry.\nStep 2: Evaluate each choice. A: his desk is where he works but we aren't given more details about his desk. B: his shelf has no specific detail to indicate he and his wife would have been looking at the same thing on it. C: the car is again not very specific.\nStep 3: The wording of \u2018in his back\u2019 does not imply one can assume the male was physically behind his own car, as we are told he is not in his own car.\nStep 4: This leaves us with choice A, which involves looking at his desk. A desk is a solid surface on which other material is put which could mean it is appropriate for him to look at another person\u2019s documents or work on it, which indicates a level of concentration.\nStep 5: Another possibility is that there was a calendar on his desk.

D: basement 5. E: kitchen\nRationales: The given question contains a sequence of a woman entering each room until she reaches a basement. Let us try to determine what she would see in each room.\n\nStart by eliminating options that have been stated as not part of what she saw.\n\nThe only alternative that remains after this step is option B.\nBecause it is the only unexcluded option, there is no point in examining other possibilities. If you are unfamiliar with \"Bedroom Tax\" that is mentioned in the question (the tax of 14%-25% is applied to all but one room per home in Britain (Great Britain)), you do not need to spend further time on the question; you can simply mark it as correct. But otherwise, you ought to take into account this.\n\nThe woman first enters apartment that can be understood as her entire residence.\nIn the kitchen, there is no sink or refrigerator or any other kitchen appliance.\nIn the bathroom, there is no bathtub, so that is not helpful either.\nFinally, the woman enters a basement which is \"a low-ceilinged, windowless and damp area\".\n\nThe question is simply asking which room a woman enters first, i.e., which room can be ruled out. \n\nThe woman is entering the basement, so the other rooms are not the first place she goes.\n\nWe need to eliminate options from the choices. It is important that all options be eliminated, except for the appropriate answer.\n\nWe can clearly eliminate option A. The woman's apartment cannot be considered as the basement (a part of her home) because she entered the basement first.\n\nApartment would be an unhelpful item to consider as the kitchen has no sink or refridgerator, so that is a dead end.\n\nWe can also eliminate option C, as the bathroom certainly does not contain a bathtub.\n\nNow the list of options we've examined is: 'Bedroom, bath", "answer": "B: health department"}
{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: Where did people play games in the past? Choices:  B: crypto currency A: internet C: cryptography D: virtual E: digital\nRationales: There were games in the past and people played these games, that is, the premise of the question.\n1. Now, we should identify the type of games that people played in the past and determine whether one is listed as an option or not.\n2. Games from the past could be played by children in the back yard, they were playing dominoes or tag or some other form of game that doesn't require internet or electricity.\n3. Another option could be the case that these games were indoor games, and one would play them inside their homes.\n4. Options C, cryptography, D, virtual, and E, digital are about the kind of technology used to play games, so they are unrelated to games that people played in prior decades.\n5. The only options that are similar to games are A (the internet) or B (crypto currency).\n6. While crypto currency is still used in the present, it wasn't widely popular until relatively recently, so the answer is probably a choice that existed in the past as well.\n7.

When the question phrases where is your bicycle, it is using ellipsis to omit what and is instead using implication to infer what is being referred to. \n2. Analyzing the alternatives and their definitions, we can come to the conclusion that each of the presented choices could be a potential answer since they are places where bicycles can be left. \n3. Choice B, 'bus stop', is most relatable, it is a well-known location where people leave all kinds of vehicle at least on a temporary basis, including bicycle.\nAnswer: B14: bus stop\n\nInput: Where you need to go if you are taking a bus? Choices:  E: highway D: city B: parking D: freeway E: sidewalk\nRationales: When the question states where you need to go, it is using elliptical omission and implying that what is a destination in this situation. The given choices are then meant to serve as possible destination answers.  \n1. Choice E (highway) is an appropriate possible answer choice since highways are common transportation routes, especially when one is taking a long or very specific destination.\n\n2. Choice D (city) is also a potential answer since cities or urban areas are often destinations and common travel routes, e.g. on buses or public transportation.\n\n3. Choice E (freeway) is also a possible correct answer in that freeways are common routes and destinations for people traveling by car.\n\n4. While choice B (parking) is technically a location, it should not be a destination since public parking lots and spots do not typically denote an arrival location, and thus the answer should be eliminated.\n\nComment: Can you explain more why answer E should be choice E: sidewalk.

Choices: A: first floor B: second floor C: third floor D: outside E: fourth floor\nRationales: The question states that one would be going to a shopping mall, and from here the answer requires identifying what the store would be in. Therefore, the answer requires the answer to be an option starting with 'third.' Then, a floor/store would be identified by the word that follows 'floors': 'floor' in this case as the choice is'store' - so the answer is 'third floor store.'\nAnswer: A: third floor store\n\nInput: It is time for some people to leave what for their place of work? Choices: A. lunch room B. cafeteria C. break room D. locker room E. restroom\nRationales: Break rooms are usually small rooms where people can go for a break from work, these rooms are almost always located in a workplace.\nLocker room is another possibility, however this is usually for people such as gym members to store their belongings and change, and locker rooms might not be in workplaces.\nThe phrase 'for their place of work' is most likely an error - to specify 'for their job'.\nLunch rooms are not usually found in workplaces - they are usually in schools or colleges.\nRestrooms might be, but these rooms are usually not found specifically for some people to leave for a break, they are usually for all workers to use freely.\nTherefore the answer is B-catering.\nAnswer: B-catering\n\nInput: What should the manager do that was not planning to come in? Choices: A \u2013 come in B \u2013 give up C \u2013 give up D \u2013 leave work E \u2013 remain absent\nRationales: Leave work: not apply to the situation.\nRemain absent: incorrect wording.\nCome in: is what managers sometimes do, but does not make sense for this situation.\nGive up: incorrect wording.

Choices:  --------- B: landing C: boarding D: parking E: taking off\nRationales: We can narrow down our answer options by looking at the verb associated with the main part of the question, 'planes taking off'. To use take off we need to be at an airport and need to take off. Therefore, these two need to be the most common answers to our question at an airport: B and C.\n\nBut there is an alternative explanation - to take off can mean in some cases to leave the town.

'Laundry' is not typically the place where personal belongings are put away in after a party, it's more like the common room where clothes and other items are washed.\n\n10. Same goes for answer 'kitchen'. Kitchens are not necessarily the main place to put away items after a party, it depends on the items you used.\n\n11. Answer 'bathroom' requires elimination as well, because while the items after a party could be put in the bathroom, they're likely already clean, so there's no need to put them in a bathroom.\n\n12. 'Clothes' are one option that could be put away but not as items you use for the party itself.\n\n13. Answer 'car' is unrelated to keeping items after a party, so eliminate it.\n\n14.

Choices:  * A: wood  * B: microwave  * C: salt  * D: pan  * E: broil  * F: grill\nRationales: The question asks about the type of cooking device used to prepare steak. The answer should focus on the means of preparing the food rather than its final end results (i.e., what the meal looks like).\n\nStep 1: Analyzethe available answer choices:\n\n* A: wood:\n* B: microwave:\n* C: salt:\n* D: pan:\n* E: broil:\n* F: grill:\n\nStep 2, Evaluate each option:\n\n* A, is definitely incorrect because wood does not function as a cooking device. You would not use this to cook or prepare your steak.\n* B, might work, but it does not fit the exact question. Using a microwave to cook steak does not necessarily answer the question. In fact, microwaves are only used to warm certain kinds of meal.\n* C, might be correct because salt can be used to flavor food. It can also be used to soften the tenderness of the beef, especially if it is frozen.\n* D, is correct because it is the most direct way of cooking food.

{"text": "record is E: erase.\n7. Erasing would mean erasing part of history or removing something from existence, which represents the elimination of an event or individual in history.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: What type of person would put a book on a shelf? Choices A: author B: reader C: editor D: customer E: librarian\nRationales: Analysing the question, we can infer that the given phrasing is related to a specific person, not an action or item, so the correct choice would require understanding which professions could potentially read a book or place it on a shelf.\n\nStep 1: Starting with the first option, A - author, it is possible an author may have a need to read their own book and put it on a shelf but this activity is probably out of necessity or as a final task.\n\nStep 2 : Next consider B - reader. If someone purchases a book, the reader (if they are responsible for it) will have to read it and most likely place it on their bookshelf afterward.\n\nStep  3: The next choice is C, editor, which indicates they might be editing or annotating some books. Then again, it is not a likely task because books are typically complete when they are published and not commonly revised or changed thereafter.\n\nStep 04: Looking at the other choices. D - customer. When customers buy books, they may not put it on the shelf after reading it or they simply may not be responsible for such action.\n\nStep 7 : The final option E - librarian. Librarians may be responsible for the operation of the library and the book catalog, where readers may need to make a book available to others.\n\nStep 9 : Comparing answer choices, we can conclude that'reader' is a more likely candidate for the correct choice. While all of the other candidates have some plausibility, they tend to have a more convoluted path to fit this definition than a reader.\n\nAnswer: A: reader\n\nInput: What are you calling someone who is taking care of pets?

{"text": "record is 'erasing history'.\nAnswer: D: erase\n\nInput: He is planning to ask questions in a speech about what? Choices: 1. 1. A: how to get married 2. B: how to be loved 3. C: how to build trust 4. D: how to deal with sadness E: how to get more money\nRationales: This is a task where we have to analyze and answer an open-ended question.\n1. Step 1: We have to narrow our focus to the context of the question.\n2. Step 2: Start by analyzing the question itself.\n3. Step 3: Consider the first choice, 'how to get married'. Is this related to the question?\n4. Step 4: No, since the question is about building trust and getting married involves building trust, but it is not about gaining money, the question is not asking about how to start a marriage or get married.\n5. The second choice, how to be loved, could be a reasonable answer for a speech on building trust but is ultimately unrelated to the task and should be eliminated.\n\nStep 7. Next, examine the third option, how to build trust. Yes, this has a relation to the task but it's unhelpful in the context of the question as the speech isn't meant to be about how to establish trust.\n\nStep 9: The possible useful options remaining are (C) how to build trust and (D) how to deal with sad. Since the speech is about building or creating trust, how to deal with sad is unreasonable because this is not something related to building trust. Thus, how to deal with a sad is not an option the question expects.\n\nStep 10: The answer that best fits this scenario is \"how to build trust\".\n\nInput: You are using what in a car? Choices:  a. radio b. stereo c. cassette d. cd player e. ethernet\nRationales: The given question presents a scenario of a listener who is using something in a car.

We are looking for something where water can be used. \n\nStep1: Evaluate options B and C, which involve water and ice. These have no place in a bathtub.\n\nStep2: Options D and E involve bathing or heating water. Bathing or heating could both be options, but they are separate from the question about the purpose of water.\n\nStep3: Option B, ice, could be water. However, it does not have any relationship to the question's purpose of the water. The question is looking for something that ice is used for.\n\nStep4: Option C, washing, can be used. Warm water is usually used for washing. \n\nStep5: Therefore, the conclusion is D, heating. \n\nAnswer: D: heating\n\nInput: What was the last thing John thought about before getting hit by a car? Choices:  C: food A: pink shirt B: a bad day E: money\nRationales: We can eliminate choice A through elimination, as John having a pink shirt has nothing to do with what he was thinking about before getting hit by the car.\n\nNext, we must evaluate options B, C, and E. There are a lot of things that people can think about before getting hit by cars, such as eating food, having a bad day, and having money.\n\nOption B is a car that John was driving. Option C is pink, which John might have been wearing or thinking about. While option E is money, food, and a vehicle, so this is a logical contender for the last thing John thought.\n\nTherefore, we must examine the rationale for choosing B. Option C can be eliminated from consideration as there are no real reasons that might lead John to think about pink, as it is not an action related to being hit by a car.\n\nThe main reason someone would think about food would be when they are hungry. This does not seem to be appropriate in this context as John is not likely to be hungry", "answer": "A: thoughtful"}
{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: D: erase\n\nInput: What do you have before they arrive? Choices: \n\n\n:\n\n:\n:\n:\n\nRationales: The question asks about the condition or situation that precedes another action. In this case, the action is the arrival of people. There are several options that could precede the arrival of people.\n\n1. The word 'be' can refer to many things, but in this case, it conveys the concept of before. When used before something, you can say that it happens before something else. In the question, you are told that before people arrive, you have something specific, and the other questions are describing that something.\n2. Let's check the other options. 'Money' is the only option without 'be'. In this context, money is clearly not the appropriate answer.\n3. The question does not ask for 'papers', while it does refer to having something to read them on, therefore it is not an adequate answer either.\n4. 'An appointment' means you have been scheduled to be there. However, that doesn't occur before the arrival of the people. You are expected to be there when they arrive, but you can't say that you have them before they arrive. Likewise, you don't have nothing before they arrive.\n5. Lastly, 'clothes' can mean what someone plans to wear when they get there, or it can refer to articles of clothing left for someone else to borrow. However, both of these options do not refer to having clothes before you arrive.\n6. The only option that is not 'be' is 'the door'. From this choice, the logic is that we have the door before we get to it, for example we are in it right now. But that's not actually what the question asked for, which was the condition you had with you before the arrival of these people. So, even though it is grammatically appropriate, the only option that you could legitimately have before you reach the door is the door itself, and having the door is inappropriate because it is an inanimate object.\n7. Therefore 'door' is the most likely answer.\nAnswer: B door\n\nInput: She is doing what after being bored? Choices:  B: sleep\nC: eat\nD: read books", "answer": "E: bus stop"}

Choices:  A. traffic isn't heavy B. traffic is not heavy C. traffic isn't busy D. traffic isn't empty E. traffic isn't crowded F. traffic not heavy\nRationales: The car may be going slower in heavy traffic but goes faster when traffic gets lighter, it may be slower when roads are crowded but goes faster when roads are empty.

It would also be very wet so flowers may not be able to be picked.\n\nIf it's an overcast day, it could either be dry and clear, or rainy and therefore unsuitable for flower picking. \n\nThunderstorms don't necessarily have clouds and thunder is generally a sound effect. Since thunder has no affect on weather and therefore clouds, thunderstorms shouldn't be associated with overcast days. \n\nA drought could potentially occur when rainfall is absent. However, droughts could mean other problems like desertification, making it not safe to pick flowers at all. \n\nLastly, a hurricane may make an environment clean, but not necessarily safe for picking flowers due to the potential of landslides and flooding. \n\nSo, the two remaining choices for a good day for picking flowers would be either:\n\nA: sunny\n\nB: after heavy rain", "answer": "B: rhythmic movement"}

Also, it has the same use: you need to move your eyes).\n\nOption B: Mirrors (mirrors can also be found in offices or in private houses. A person can look to fix their hair in the morning.

Choices:  B: yes A: no C: down E: up D: flat\nRationales:1. The question asks if someone who made it to the top of a hill can continue down the hill, or if it's too steep.\n2. Option 'down' is the correct answer because the phrase 'down the hill' in relation to walking would imply that a person is walking downhill, which makes perfect sense.\n3. Options 'up' and 'flat' are definitely not related to the question in any reasonable way.\n4. Option 'No' would actually be the opposite of the actual phrase, which isn't the same answer as in the question.\n5.

Therefore, words like 'too much' can be interpreted as the opposite of 'not enough'.\n3. Option 'not right' is not relevant to the question as the question is asking for the opposite of not enough, and this word is not relevant to the meaning of the question.\n4. Option A: 'not good enough' doesn't make sense because if 'not good enough' were an appropriate interpretation of the question, then there would be a possibility for any good enough amount.\n5. Option B: 'not good enough also doesn't make sense, because if 'not good enoug' were an appropriate interpretation to the question then it would entail any amount not enough.\n6.

It is hotter when sitting against a window C. Temperature does not change significantly when sitting against a window D. It is warmer when sitting against a window E. It is colder when sitting against a window\nRationales: The reason is based on the fact that window glass has a cooling effect on the temperature of objects. When sitting in front of the window, there is a flow of air that prevents the sun from directly touching your body and keeps the temperature around you cooler. It is also the position of your body, which determines the temperature of its surface in different ways.\n\n1. In the first option, \"cooler\" is a word that means colder. When this word is connected to the sentence, the sentence does not make sense.\n2. In the second option, \"hotter\" is connected to the sentence. In the sentence you will find out \"it is hotter for sitting against the window\". It makes complete sense.\n3. In the third option, the temperature change when sitting against a window is not stated. So it doesn't make sense.\n4. In the fourth option, \"warmer\" means the same as hotter, so the sentence is consistent.\n5. In the fifth option, \"colder\" is used with the word \"with\", which does not match the meaning of \"colder\" stated in the first sentence.\n6.

Choices:  A. jewellery  B. gold watch C. diamond D. antique E. artwork\nRationales: It's important to examine the phrasing of the question and take advantage of the provided context.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate choice 'A', jewelry.\n\nStep 2 The question gives us a context of people who lost valuables and then gives us a selection of options for the most valuable.\n\nStep  3 The options for this question are in the form of possessions, but 'jewelry' is singular, which indicates a value of one type of item.\n\nStep 7 Compare choice A with choices B, C, and E, which are all possessions in the plural form. We can eliminate choice A because the singularity and the presence of a definite article indicates that 'jewelry is not the option that corresponds most closely to the option given in the question.\n\nStep 9 The remaining options are B(gold watch), C(diamond), and E(artwork), all of which are the pluralised form of personal goods or a variety of things. Compared to jewelry, all are pluralized, yet in different ways (gold watch, diamond, and artwork).\n\nStep 10 The options B, C, and D are a reasonable choice because those are a variety of items or possessions, and one of them could end up being more valuable (but not necessarily the one specifically given).\n\nStep 21 The first option in the available choices (B) is gold watch, but gold watch as an item has monetary value in its self and could be considered valuable, making it the best answer for the most valuable possession.\n\nAnswer: D: gold watch\n\nInput: What does a dentist examine teeth for? Choices: A: cavities in teeth B: tooth decay C: toothache D: tooth decay E: infected teeth\nRationales: Consider the question as a whole and try to understand its reasoning.

Choices: 0: call a neighbor 1: call a vet 2: put a reward 3: check the animal shelter 4: check Craigslist 5: ask around 6: drive around\nRationales:\n\nStep-1: After reading the options, look for themes, commonalties, patterns, and any other interesting details that may be worthy of note.\n\nStep-2: Look at each option. There are a few standout words that capture the key theme of the question and can help us to further analyze each answer.\n\nFor 0, it says to 'call a neighbor', we can infer that the missing pet is probably either a cat or dog as pets living in a neighborhood are most likely not missing and were also most likely not likely for a neighbor to find.\n\nFor 1, it says to 'contact a vet', so we can probably assume 1 is probably either a cat, dog or another exotic pet as the vet may have information on a recently missing pet and are professionals who can advise on taking the next steps.\n\nFor 2, 'put a reward' sounds like a reasonable option for an animal that has gone missing.\n\nFor 3, 'checking the animal shelter' captures a part of this question that is likely going to be associated with a missing animal that is on the street roaming for food or water. This also means that the missing pet is not owned by the owner of the animal shelter.\n\nFor 4, 'check Craigslist' could include looking for listings with lost pets that have just gone missing, or perhaps a listing that has a pet up for adoption.\n\nFor 5, 'asking around' is perhaps asking for information from other pet owners which may be possible information on their pet that has gone missing. This method is likely for people who find an animal that they suspect to belong to another pet owner to find the true owner.\n\nFor 6, 'driving around' is a common method of finding an animal that may be on the street for people to discover as they drive for either work, the grocery store or for recreational activities.\n\nStep-3:", "answer": "E: pleasure"}

Choices: \t A: have a good time B: make him her boyfriend C: give him her number D: leave E: none of these\nRationales: This question requires us to pick the correct option from the choices provided.\n\nThere are a few assumptions we draw from this question. \n1. From the phrase \"found her old boyfriend\" and use the phrase \"old boyfriend\", we can reason that the one who finds her old boyfriend is not that old boyfriend, therefore it is her who is finding the old boyfriend.\n2. From the phrase \"have a good time\" and the phrasing \"found her old boy friend\" we can conclude that in this scenario, the old boyfriend does not find the girl and it is the other way around.\n3. The girl is finding her old boyfriend, and the old boyfriend is not looking for anyone. Based on this, the only possibilities for things she likely to do include A, B, C and D\n4. Option A, \"have a good time\", is most likely the one that fits and is the answer.\n\nAnswer: B, C, D: not applicable\n\nInput: You can use a rope to do what? Choices: 1. climb a tree 2. make a rope swing 3. tie a pig 4. make a snake 5. tie a cat\nRationales: All of the options involve ropes: climbing trees, making swings, tying pigs, making snakes, and tying cats. However, the choices are not clear cut. The options are vague.\n\nThis is because no rope is inherently \"good\" at climbing a tree, making swings, etc. Any rope can be used for that.\n\nTherefore, we need to pick the best out of the given choices based on the scenario description.\n\nThe scenario describes having the use a rope to swing from on a rope swing. A rope swing is usually made with a rope and made to swing with a rope. The best option that meets these criteria is option #2.", "answer": "B: buy"}

Choices: \n\n 1. Cleaning off the dust from it 2. Turn it off/on 3. Repair it 4. Drive it to the mechanic 5. Repair it using parts from 4 6. Repair it using pieces from 1 \nRationales: The question is asking about what a car does if the horn isn't working. The answers the question is asking are (1) Cleaning off the dirt to fix the problem. (2) Fix the problem, which could be turning it on and off by pushing the horn button repeatedly until the problem is fixed. (3) Repair the problem is a possibility, too. (4) Bring it to a mechanic for repairs (5) Repair the horn using horn from the car is possible, and then (6) Repair the horn by using pieces from the car's horn itself. We can go from (1) to (5). (6) doesn't fit because when you use pieces from the car' (s) horn, you're not using pieces taken from the car itself, and it also depends on the quality of the piece of (s) horn and if all the pieces are replaceable or not.\nAnswer: A, B, C, E\n\nInput: Which of the following statements is incorrect?

Answer: 1, 3\nRationales: We can go through the statements (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and put each within the right context if they could have been said in English: \n\n - Store - where someone has something (in this case, where someone has clothes and food)  - Store - a market (grocer - a person who makes clothes and food on a large scale - grocery store", "answer": "C: friend's house"}

Choices: A: the month B: your schedule C: the clock D: the weather  E: a poster\nRationales: The question is an embedded question requiring the reader to analyze the situation and look for clues from the context.\n1. Given the situation, the calendar is clearly relevant and therefore, this option may provide the reader with important clues.\n2. The clue is the calendar, which must provide some kind of information so that you may look at it in the question.\n3. Therefore, the appropriate choice is 'A: the month'. \nAnswer: A: the month\n\nInput: Do you think they will have a wedding? Choices: A. No B C D E F\nRationales: This question asks about the intent or possibility of having a wedding. \n\n1. The given responses are options that can be related to having a wedding, while the other option is not.\n2. Consider:\n3. 'Do you think _______ to have a baby?' or 'Do you think ____ to buy a house?' are questions that have similar wordings as this one.\n4. Therefore, we have eliminated the unrelated answers and our choices can be simplified to 'A: Yes, B: No'.\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is \"No\" because one is likely to be more inclined to choose 'Yes' to express uncertainty or lack of knowledge.\n6. The other answer is thus unrelated and not a solution to the problem.\n\nAnswer: B: No\n\nInput: Did the group have a bad night? Choices: A B C D E F G H I J K L M \nRationales: We can eliminate all but the three most likely answers (with respect to context) by considering the meaning of each answer and the relationship between each answer and the sentence. \n\n1: \"Group\" here is likely to mean a large number of people and in this context we don't know whether the group had bad or good luck in their attempt at doing something. So, this is not the answer that best matches the question.\n2: 'Yes' is a word that can be used to indicate agreement with a sentiment or statement. So, this is also not the answer that best fits for the question.", "answer": "B: known person"}

Choices: 1. A: garage B: street C: sidewalk D: parking E: trail\nRationales:  1. The question asks where the answer will be found if this is the case. The choices are a garage, a sidewalk, a traiil, a street, a parking, and a road.\n2. A garage should contain many vehicles. If they are riding a bicycle with nobody else around, they won't be in a garage.\n3. A street should contain many vehicles and people. If they're riding a bike, they won't find themselves there.\n4. A sidewalk is a pedestrian-only space that is typically not a great place to meet someone, but if they meet on a street, they're likely in a bad place, and if there were others around, they would be in a garage or a road.\n5. A trail has a lot of vegetation, which isn't very common on a street.\n6. If they had been on the parking lot, they wouldn't meet someone, but they would be in a bad place.\n7.

The question asks what these are and they are clothing items. \n\n2. \"These\" should be a word referring to the clothing items that are being worn. \n\n3. Based on the clothing description the best choice would be T: underwear. Since shorts are part of clothing, it is not a correct", "answer": "A: jewelry store"}
{"text": "record is 'erase'.\n7. A'rewrite' is a correct term for rewriting history, but it is not related to 'burning a record'.\n8. Similarly, playing music or erasing music from a system are not implied by the phrase either.\n9. Tape and CD could be seen as potential responses if the record itself is not a metaphor. Or, if we took it literally and examined other properties of burning a record other than erasing, CD could be an option. But, in the context of this question, these options are not relevant.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: What will be used on the ground for safety? Choices: \tA: dirt B: water C: grass D: concrete E: plastic\nRationales: The answer is water. Consider each option in turn, there is only one way that is obvious and fits with the text at the top: the ground would be used for safety.\n1. Water is often used to make an area inaccessible, so if the text refers to the ground and safety, water is an obvious answer.\n2. Grass would not be used as it is more for aesthetics.\n3. Dirt would also not be used as it would be less stable or less clear for safety than water.\n4. Plastic would also not be used if it's just for safety.\n5. Concrete would only be used for safety if there was a large problem that required solving (such as in construction), so that would not be a possible response.\n6. B: water is the only response that is also obvious and that fits with the text as a choice.\nAnswer: B. water\n\nInput: What can store the items? Choices: 1.

Choices:  Cut lawn C: ring doorbell D: knock on door E: text F: leave message\nRationales: A lawn could be cut and a door could be knocked on, but the question refers to 'knowing if' someone is home. You can't truly know if someone is home based on the facts stated in this question and choices. Therefore, we can scratch off C: Cut lawn and E: Leave message as they're not helpful enough for knowing if someone is home.\n\nA: Ring doorbell is a very good way to see if someone is home, but this answer is correct only when there is a doorbell attached on the door of the house. Not everyone who lives alone has it or who lives in an apartment might not have access to this. So, it is not the correct answer.\n\nB: Knock on door is not enough and the person might not hear you. It might not be answered by the person who is home as well.\n\nD: Text to their mobile phone is also correct, but this choice is not suitable for the question.\n\nSo, the correct answer is F: Leave message.", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

A: alone B: with a trainer C: with his body D: online E: with his pets\nRationales: For this sort of question, you should:\n1. Analyse each of the given options to determine which is most likely to be performed by the speak.\n2. Look for clues in the question itself.\n3. Examine the options again to ensure you have made a correct judgement.\n4. The question provides sufficient information to eliminate some of the options. We know that the speaker will be working out, and that they'll be doing it alone.\n5. That rules out the options 'C: with his body' and 'E: with his pets\u201d.\n6. The key options left in the question are 'A: alone' and 'B: with a trainer', both possible answers. While the answer could be 'with a trainer', this is not the strongest of the two choices for the speaker to be engaged in his sport, the key indicator being 'alone'.\n7. Therefore, 'alone' is the correct answer and will be marked on your test.\nAnswer: 1: A: alone\n\nInput: What did they write to say this was the day to go to a library?

D; I have homework;\n5. E; Happy Independence Day.\n6. The correct answer is E; Happy Independence day.\n7. An important idea to remember when solving this kind of question is that, even if the statements in the choices don't explicitly say that they mean something, you must consider all the possibilities. \n8. In other words, your options are not limited to the literal meaning and you'll be wise to consider figurative meanings.\n9. For example, although the literal meaning of 'Busy' doesn't involve rain, the answer is still \"busy\".\n10. In the given anal", "answer": "D: food court"}

We need to choose an answer that is the opposite of the given action.\n\nOption A: The answer is NOT LEFT, because bikes can be left, either at homes, on roads, etc.\n\nOption B: The answer is NOT PARKED, because bikes also can be parked, they are vehicles that can be parked.\n\nOption C: The answer is NOT REPAIRED, because bikes also don't need to be repaired, and they are repaired by mechanics who are generally not the person in question in the question.\n\nOption D: The answer is NOT STOLEN, because bikes have been stolen, and they are sold at times. \n\nOption E: The answer is NOT DAMAGED, because this option does not have much sense, because the bike could be just used to perform some other actions.\n\nThis leaves us with just the correct answer - NOT LEFT.\n\nAnswer: C: repaired\n\n\n### Instructions:\nWhen performing a task, answer the following.

'Person' is just a singular form of 'person'. \n3. 'Friends' refers to a category of people, the question is asking for the number. \n4. 'People' is a correct answer, meaning the number of people asked about is in reference to the word 'people'. \n5. 'People group' is not a term that necessarily exists.\n6.

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: B: tape\n\nInput: Where would a person keep a note if their desk was wet? Choices: 1: A: fridge B: bookshelf 2: C: cupboard D: drawer E: bedside table\nRationales: The given question asks about where people would put wet notes.\n\nFrom all provided options, we can eliminate two of them: E: bedside table and A: fridge. No one typically puts their wet notes in the fridge or at their bedside table.\n\nBesides, the provided choices already contain too many things for the context of the question. Only one of them must be correct. So, the choice D: drawer isn't valid.\n\nLastly, the information in options A, B, C, D, and E suggests that the context of this question is where to put a wet note if you're working at a desk. That's where the drawer comes in. \n\nAnswer: B: bookshelf\n\nInput: We were given a 2-digit code on a phone display. What could come after this code? Choices: A: a message B: a command C: a space D: a person  E: no input\nRationales: This question is relatively complex and it's hard to understand just by looking at the choices. We need to combine our intuition and deduction to comprehend it.\n\nWe can eliminate D and E options which are not likely to go together with the given code. The message, command, and space could be combined with a person but what about the no input? It seems not appropriate for this context.\n\nAnother thing to be noted from the options is that no input suggests to a blank code. We can tell that this should be the one that comes after the code we're given.\n\nIf the given code is a blank code, no input could be the next. But the code on the phone display can't be blank unless it's a zero or a space (0 or 255). The code being given is not space, so it'd only be zeroes. Then, we can combine it with no input or space.\n\nCombined with what we know, we can eliminate the choices which will make sense but aren't likely to be the correct answer.

A: drug store B: department store C: bookstore D: small business E: restaurant\nRationales: The given options are: 1) bookstore 2) drug store 3) department store 4) restaurant\n1) Bookstore is not a store that has an entrance next to the register since they typically don't have any registers.\n2) A Drug Store is what is called a \"Retail Pharmacy\" in the United States. A typical Drug Store will not have an entrance or door next to the register since the typical layout is that a customer enters a pharmacy and is greeted by the pharmacy technician or the owner of the store that dispenses any requested medicine.\n3) A Department store is not what is being described. If you would search online you would find that a Department Store is actually more like a Mega-Store Supermarket of some sort since it is more organized than a Drug Store. A typical department store is usually more spacious and has separate entrances for different sections where it is not typical that the check out section is right next to the entrance. \n4) A Restaurant like McDonalds or Wendy's also do not typically have an entrance that is located next to the check out. Usually, a Restaurant is located in the back of the building, often with the kitchen in a separate building altogether. There is always a line of people waiting for food when the Restaurant is busy. Restaurants also tend to close earlier than Retail Stores. \n5) If you look online you would see that a Small Business is a very small business where you sell things from your home. It is not common to be given the option of Small Business within Retail.\nAnswer: B. 1-3: Drug Store and Department Store, 4: Restaurant, 5: Small Business", "answer": "C: frustration"}
{"text": "record is E, 'erase'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: Where did you go? Choices:  a: bus b: school c: office d: house e: apartment\nRationales: It asks where did you go, a particular place. So we can look at the answers given and choose one that fits the question. \n\na: bus : we can know that the bus stands inside a school or house.\nb: school : A school is a place where you learn and are given knowledge in different fields. So it cannot go in the bus.\nc: office : it cannot be anywhere other than at its own place.\nd: house : we have to choose between house and apartment. A house is built in the ground. But an apartment is made of concrete or steel.\ne: apartment : it can choose between house and a apartment. In apartment there are chances to learn more things than in a house.\nAnswer: b: school\n\nInput: Where can you receive payment online? Choice: a) credit card b) cash app c) PayPal d) Cashapp e) Venmo\nRationales: The first thing we need to determine is that we are looking for a place online to receive cash. The place would have to be online, so the answer cannot be received offline to qualify. Next, we will eliminate all options but a credit card, cash app, PayPal, and Venmo. PayPal and Venmo are payment systems, and we know that the person cannot receive money in these places offline. These are two out of five options to eliminate. Now, we will look at cash app. Cash app is a very specific payment service, so we can narrow our options down. Credit cards are almost like cards, but the person will have to have the card and an account in order to use them. Therefore, that leaves us with cash app, and the only other payment systems left that qualify are PayPal, and Venimo. We can use our experience to know that PayPal and Venmo can handle online payments, and there's really no way to say which site would handle cash, since they would have to allow the sender to choose it. The question gives us four options and there are only five choices, and none of these options are \"receive cash online\" so we know it'", "answer": "A: apply for job"}

Choices:  C: mixer E: oven F: measuring cup D: knife H: bake A: measuring spoon\nRationales: The text presents an analogy in which making cake is being used as a metaphor for something or the action of creating something, for which the provided options can be used to answer the question, thus, answer choices B, H, and E can be eliminated. C is probably a kitchen device used by the maker of the cake, whereas D is a cutting tool used after the cake is made. \n1. Answer C is \"mixer\", the device used to mix ingredients of cake.\n2. Answer E is \"oven\", because it is needed to bake cake and it is available in a bakery.\nInput: Do farmer use what type of tool?

Choices: \n\nA: grocery B: thrift store C: clothing store E: toy store\n\nRationales: This question is asking about a place that has many options to play games. There are several places where one can play games. However, some of the locations don't match well with the type of toys typically sold by each seller.\n\n1. Thrift stores sell second hand clothing and rarely sell toys.\n2. Grocery stores don't necessarily sell toys.\n3. Many clothing stores in fact don't sell toys.\n4. Toy stores don't have as many options for games.\n5. Therefore, the best options for playing games are a toy store or a place with a lot of seller-type toys.\n6.

Well, if water isn't a drink, then what is? What is a drink that isn't water? Let's see\u2026 Let's focus on items that are used for drinking. In other words, let's look at our drinking accessories and how they are used. A cup is for drinks, a bowl is for drinks, and a jar is for drinks. And what about drinks and water? Water is definitely a drink. No water means no drink. A water isn't a mug, but it's also not a cup. It's a completely different shape. This narrows it down to a bowl or a jar. A jar is an item used in a kitchen and can be used for other things. However, if it's used for drinks, it's a jar. So that leaves us with a jar.\n\nAnswer: B: bowl\n\nInput: What vehicle has two wheels? Choices:  B: vehicle C: motorcycle D: car A: bike vehicle E: truck\nRationales: Each option has a vehicle with different number of wheels. Examine Choice C, which has two wheels. Also examine Choice B, which has at least four wheels. None of the vehicles in Choice A and Choice E has two wheels. Choice B has four wheels. Hence, Choice B is the right answer.\nAnswer: B) vehicle with four wheels\n\nInput: When it is sunny, what would you put on?

Choices: 2: Vinegar 2: Olive oil 4: Tea Tree Oil 3: Shampoo 5: Witch hazel\nRationales:(Please see the attached picture for the image from 9:53:36 PM)\n1. We can eliminate Tea Tree oil and Shampoo because they don't remove lice.\n2. We can identify that tea tree oil, shampoo and vinegar can all be used to remove lice.\n3. Olive oil kills all parasites.\n4. Witch hazel does not remove lice.\n5. Vinegar and tea tree oil are options that can be used to remove louse from hair.\n6.

{"text": "record would be 'erase history'.\nAnswer: D: erase history\n\nInput: She didn't want to read anymore, she was what because of the time being passed? Choices: \tA: bored B: upset C: irritated \nD: depressed  E: surprised \nRationales: This instruction provides a scenario that is related to 'begrudging something' by an action.\n1. So, we have to identify which option is best associated with the given answer pattern.\n2. The choices presented are: 'bored' (irrelevant), 'upset' (irrelevant as 'time passing' implies 'old age'), 'irritated' (irrelevant).\n3. If a person wants to read while feeling 'bored', they'll likely choose to pass time by looking into the material.\n4. 'Depressed' or 'Depression', for example, could be linked to reading a book. However,'reading' is not necessarily associated with these feelings. The feeling itself is far broader and deeper than just reading.\n5. In light of these observations, we rule out the options 'bore' and 'boredom' because they are related to being bored and not necessarily associative with 'feeling down' upon reading.\n6. We also rule out'surprise' because this could possibly be a reaction of someone to have finished reading something. 'Finishing' is not the same thing as'reading' and it is also a broader feeling than merely reading. \n7. Since the options left are: 'depressed' and 'depression', the latter seems to be the most appropriate and specific answer.\n8. So, the correct answer is E: 'depression'.\nAnswer: E: depression\n\n### 13.\nInput: The person was not working during the day because? Choices: \nA: sick B: tired C: had to babysit D: went on vacation E: went home\n Rationales: \n1. In the question, we're told that an individual 'was at home'.\n2. To be at home, the person must be in the vicinity of where they live i.e. they must have returned home.\n3. That means the individual wasn't at work during the day in their role within the workforce", "answer": "C: fun"}

Choices:  DDram D: Cache E: PROM D: Cryptocurrency\nRationales: Let's go through a short analysis of every possible option: A: Hard disk does not store digital information not in its hard disk. Therefore, the answer can't be the hard disk. \n\nB: 'Not in' hard disk, from the sentence above, might not be the context or meaning that a person wants to use for the hard disk.\n\nC: The computer does store information in Cache memory however; Cache memory is a type of semiconductor memory specifically designed for use at high-speed locations. Cache memory has a much smaller capacity than the other types of memory in a computer. \n\nD: 'DDram' is either incorrect or doesn't refer to information storage.\n\nE: 'PROM' is also incorrect.\n\nF: 'Cryptocurrency' is incorrect too.\n\nG: This just doesn't make any sense at all.\n\nH: You could use this for information storage, but it's far too low-capacity to store the necessary information for this question.\n\nI: This has nothing to do with computers.\n\nIn context, 'hard' is used in its non-technical and slang meaning of 'difficult'.

Choices D: Ice A: Thermostat B: Fire D: Temperature change in atmosphere\nRationales:  1. First, let us read the question carefully. Then, we must read each option carefully.\n2. We can eliminate the choice \"D: temperature change in atmosphere\" as we cannot see how temperature changes there. \n3. We can also eliminate \"A: Thermostat\" for the same reason.\n4. Similarly, we can also eliminate \"B: Fire\" for the same reason as we cannot see what happens to the temperature in a fire.\n5. Thus, we are left with only two options \"C: Ice\" and \"Ice\".

Choices: 1: buy 2: have 3: get 4: choose 5: make\nRationales: Analysis 1. Each of the given options has the meaning, e.g. buy - is the use of buying, have - is the use of having, get - is the use of getting etc.\n2. You can go to the doctor's office to pick up the prescription but what you do next depends on you.\n3. However, all of the other words imply the action of doing something to something else, e.g. make the prescription, chose what to buy on a prescription.\n4. In these cases, the other options, buy, have, get refer to you.\n5. Therefore, the word that best fits this situation is 'do'.\n6. After 'do', there are several answers that can fit the use of 'do', like 'doing something'.\n7. In this case, we are not picking up the prescription to do something else like:\n8. - Buy things for the family to make a meal.\n9. - Gather stuff because you are going for a road trip.\n10. - Go home, do some chores and make some dinner.\n11. - Give medicine to a baby.\n12. But we are picking up only the oneself, so the answer should be, 'doing something only for him or herself'.\n13. Therefore, the best answer will be 'do'.\nAnswer: A: do", "answer": "D: parking lot"}

Choices:  ____A: earring_ B: eye contact_ C: sunlight_ D: blue eyes_ E: red lipstick_\nRationales: The question is asking about a relationship between 'glasses' and another aspect. One can deduce this from the phrase 'what does the person make'.\n\nGiven that, we must evaluate each answer based on this. Firstly, options ____A and ____B are not related to wearing glasses itself as they are both physical traits like blue eyes, eyelashes, eye lenses, and lips are not.\n\nFurther, option ____D implies that wearing glasses is somehow related to having blue eyes. This is incorrect as anyone can wear glasses regardless of the color of their eyes.\n\nNext, option ____C indicates that glasses affect a person's eye contact and that's not true.\n\nThis leaves us with ____E, which is the only option that is logically related to glasses.\nAnswer: E: red lipst\n\nInput: What should you do to the car so that you can drive it yourself? Choices:  B: drive it C: clean it D: fill it with gas E: pay for it \nRationales: An analysis of each option reveals that none of these options can be categorized as the step that is being referred to. If we take _________A, 'drive it', then it becomes clear that in order to do this, one needs to clean the car and fill it with gas.\n\nOnto _________B. It cannot be categorized as a step required to drive the car as it is a step required after the car has been driven. The next action in this scenario would be filling the car with gas.\n\nSimilarly, option _________C cannot be categorized as it is also performed after the car has been cleaned and driven.\n\nNow, we can confidently eliminate options ________A and ________B and we're left with two choices, option _________D, 'clean it', and _________E, 'fill it with gas'. Now we can logically exclude _________D as 'cleaning the car' is a step that comes after '", "answer": "B: finger"}

Choices: \nA: eat B: take a break C: help D: rest E: put away\nRationales:  1. The question poses the scenario where a person brings food. From here, we should identify what the intended act would be.\n2. The provided choice statements 'put away','rest', 'take a break', and 'help' do not immediately denote the action of bringing food.\n3. Hence, the answer that best matches the reasoning would be 'eating the food'.\n\nAnswer: A: eat\n\nInput: Why would they bring back their luggage? Choices:  B: forgot to take it off C: get more D: return it E: no reason F: pick up\nRationales: Let's analyze each choice statement:\n\n1. B: forgot to take them off. The luggage was brought back because it was forgotten and not because it was \"brought back\" (as in brought back to the airport again).\n\n2. C: getting more. Assuming the luggage was not forgotten, it was 'brought back for more'.\n\n3. D: return it. The luggage is returned as it is not brought back.\n\n4. E: no reason. The context of the question assumes that the luggage had not been left behind or forgotten, hence it was brought 'back' - so it could not have been no reason.\n\n5. F: pick up. Picking up luggage is done by someone other than the owner (e.g. hotel staff at the door when you arrive). Also, luggage is usually retrieved when it is 'left behind' or forgotten.\n\nThe best answer is D: return it - which matches the context and does not refer to luggage which is left behind or forgotten.\nAnswer: D \u2013 return\n\nInput: How do they want to keep it?

{"text": "record is that of 'erasing history'.\nAnswer: C'erase': they were trying to erase history.\n\nInput: What will you find between the keys on a keypad? Choices:  B: numbers A: letters C: special symbols D: spaces E: letters\nRationales: Option A, letters, is obviously true since letters are not typically found in the middle of a keypad (although they can be) and the question is asking what is found between the keys of a keypad. Option B, which says 'numbers', is also an appropriate answer since a keypad does have space for numbers. If you're wondering why'special symbols' is incorrect, it can be eliminated because there are no special symbols on a keypad.\nOption D,'spaces', is also incorrect. On a typical keypad, there are just keyholes with no extra spaces or anything else in between. \nOption E, letters, is incorrect since a keypad is usually not large enough to display letters, but has enough keys for special symbols or numbers. If you've seen an actual keypad (typically the one on the phone) you'll notice that it says A, B, C, etc. So option B, letters, is obviously incorrect. \nThus, option B, letters, which is the standard answer to the above question is the most acceptable choice.\nAnswer: A, letters, which is also true, because while numbers may be found on a keypad as well, letters are the most frequent answer to this question.\n\nInput: When do you usually use a ladle? Choices:  D: when cooking a stew E: in the sink F: on dinner plate G: in the cabinet\nRationales: The question asks about the most typical reason people would use a ladle. Since we can remove 'G: in the cabinet' as an option of possible reasons to use a ladle, this leaves us with four choices and we should examine them more closely. 'D: when cooking a stew' would be a correct answer since ladles are often used to scoop, mix and pour stews, gravies, soups, and other cooked foods. However, we can eliminate 'F: on the dinner plate', 'E: in the sink', and 'G: in the kitchen'. 'F: on the kitchen' is incorrect because in this case,", "answer": "E: hands"}

Choices:  Went to the restaurant: Ordered A: food, B: soda, C: appetizer, D: juice, E: waiter\nRationales: First, lets examine each choice. \n\nStep #1: We can eliminate C, appetizer. Choice C, means meal before main course, and the situation does not demand eating at the restaurant or food in general.\n\nStep #2: We can dismiss D, juice and waiter too. Choice D, is not the name of an actual item or service available, the word cannot be modified as we like, it is just a verb. For waiter, the word is not an object for ordering, nor it gives a person's command, it is simply a verb.\n\nStep #3: The only three possible answers are food, soda and appetizer. But none of them are correct, because when one went to the restaurant, he wanted to order something. And there was something that was available when he went, what the answer should be what to order.\n\nStep #4: This means that the choice order A: food, B; soda must be the answer since it is the only objectively correct option.\n\nAnswer: A: food, B, soda\n\nInput: At the grocery you can buy food, what type of food are you in the store getting? Choices: A: meat B: vegetables C: fruit D: dairy E: bakery\nRationales: After reading the question with options we can identify that we are in the store to buy food and it is the reason why we go there so there isn't a type of food that we don't buy in the store to get. In fact there are a lot of different things we can buy that all are foods, we can buy dairy products, fruit, vegetables, meat, bakery items etc. At the grocery we can buy everything even more because now we can buy dairy in the different sections we are going to but those four are more related to the stores purpose of selling different food items to the customers.

You can learn the color when doing certain tasks, 3. Knowing the color is always necessary, 4. You don't need to know the color when you complete certain tasks, 5. You would not need to know the color if you did certain tasks.\nRationales: There are a number of situations where knowing the color of something would be useful and necessary. \n(1) Learning the color can be important especially when one is trying to distinguish between two or more things. For example, when one has two identical items and they need to know if either item is red, they might want to know the color.\n(2) Certain tasks like coloring or decorating would require you to know the color. \n(3) Even if the color isn't necessary for the task, often knowing the color can provide additional context and help you better remember information.\n\n(4) Some tasks do not require knowing the color. For example, when you see someone and you're not particularly interested in their clothing color, then you don't need to be aware of the clothing color to recognize or interact with the person.\n\n(5) In certain situations, knowing the color is not necessary. This might be if someone is wearing a specific color that you're unfamiliar with, or you're focusing on a different aspect of a person's appearance.\n\nWe can eliminate options 2 and 4 because learning the color would be unnecessary in those cases (unless there was a specific reason or context why one would need to learn the color). \n\nIn the end, we're left with 1, 2, and 5 as the most plausible answers because of the way the question is phrased (\"When would you need to know ___\", followed by \"You don't need to ___ when you do ___\").\n\nAnswer: Choices: 2,5\n\nInput: The woman took note, this meant they were going to meet at the restaurant?

{"text": "record is'rewrite history'.\nAnswer: B: tape\n\nInput: What are they trying to achieve? Choices: \nA: balance a bill B: cover the total payment C: pay with cash D: pay late E: pay more than the bill\n\nRationales:\n1. Consider each option individually to identify a strategy for balance a bill and what is the possible impact on a person's finances.\n2. 'Balance a bill' could mean several things but the most common interpretation is 'paying your bill in full'.\n3. Paying something in full is generally a good sign because it can show your ability and willingness to pay.\n4. Paying fully might also help reduce the interest rate or improve your credit status with the creditor.\n5. On the other hand, 'cover the total payment' is an alternative that could also mean paying the bill in full.\n6. However, if you still can't pay the bill in full or on time.\n7. 'Payment late' is not related to a person's intention to balance a bill.\n8. 'Paying with cash' is also out of context because it is unreasonable to think about paying the bill in cash and it can also cause complications for the creditor.\n9. 'Pay more than the bill' sounds like the intent, but it might cause some issues with the creditor. \n10. Therefore, the best option to answer the question is A: balance a bill.\nAnswer: A, balance a bill\n\nInput: What type of product should they buy to stop dry spots?

'Shampoo' could theoretically be used to stop dryness on hair.\n2. But it is implausible to use it to stop dryness on your face and there are no dry spots you can put it on.\n3.

Choices:  Titanic  (book) A: Titanic (sinker) B: money C: ship D: ocean E: flower\nRationales: The question asks: What did the person receive in a lotus bag after they ordered a lotus flower?\n\nThe answer is not 'the flower', which is what the person ordered and what is received.\n\nThe question instead asks about the additional item that may be received in the bag or the thing that one is actually getting from the flower.\n\nWhen considering each of the suggested answers, not all answers are possible but it is suggested a lotus bag would not have all the answers contained within it.\n\nSo elimination of all except the first answer is ideal.\n\nAnswer: E: flower\n\nInput: What does a man do if he buys a new watch for a dollar?

Choices:  (Most common answer)  A: crawling B: sweater C: blanket D: hat E: sleeping\nRationales: Start by analyzing each response and understanding the role of the baby in each one.\n\nStep 2. We can eliminate answer A as it is obviously not a thing that babies do to stay warm as that is the activity, they are engaged in.\n\nStep 13. Option B refers to an item of clothing, not a specific and separate activity that babies do, so it is also incorrect.\n\nStep 7. Answer choice C provides more context to the baby\u2019s activity which is crawling, since crawling babies get warmer. However, the question asks about things that babies do generally, not specific contextual things, so this answer is also incorrect\n\nStep 15. Option D is an activity that babies might do, but it is far less common than answer D, \"sleeping\". Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is: \nStep 16. D as the common response.\n\nStep 9. Option E is a type of clothing, not an action to perform while keeping warm.\n\nStep 0.

Cake box is not a food item and does not fit this context, so that is eliminated.\n8. Toy box would certainly have toys, therefore does not make it a cake box.\n9.

Choices:  B: Hawaii C: South America E: United States D: Japan A: Africa\nRationales: To analyze the above question, it is important to understand the question statement and examine the choices.\n\n1. As per the statement, \"a lot of countries produce coffee\". It means that there are multiple countries producing coffee and, of all those many, one country produces the most coffee.\n2. Now, there are a number of possible choices. A few of them may not produce coffee at all. There are a few countries that may produce less than a cup of coffee or only a couple of cups of coffee per year.\n3. Therefore, these are immediately eliminated.\n4.

Choices:  TOP: baker A: flamingo B: cat C: cup D: box E: tree\nRationales: To answer this question, we will need to identify the logical association between each item in the question.\n\n1. Option 'A: flamingo' is only present in candles but not in the cake.\n2. Option 'B: cat' is present in candles as well as the cake.\n3. Option 'C: cup' is present in the cake and not present in any candle.\n4. Option 'D: box' is present in the candles and present in the cake. \n5. Option 'E: tree' is present in the both the cake and the candles.\n\n6. It can be determined that object 'A' is a 'flamingo', it is present in candles and not in the cake, thus not applicable.\n7. 'B' is a 'cat' which is present in the candle and the cake as the candle 'has' a cat, and the cake could 'have' a cat.\n8. Therefore 'B' in the actual cake could be a cat.\n9. 'C' is a cup and is present in the cakes. \n10. It could be said that 'C' is in the cake.   \n\n11. 'D' is a 'box' which is present in both the cake and candles, we can conclude that its present on candles and the cake.\n12. 'E' is a 'tree' which is present in candles.\n13. It can be determined 'E' in the cake could be a tree.\n\n14. Since the question asked for answer in cake, we can only assume that objects are placed in both the cake, and not candles.\n15.

Choices: \n\nA: frustration B: boredom C: hurt D: happy E: hungry \nRationales: There are four possible responses that this question implies. \n\n1. We begin by examining the question itself. The key word here is \"hammer\". A hammers role is typically to hit or drive a nail into a surface to hold things in place. \n\n2. Now, as we consider the options, let's break them down and see how they relate to the action of banging a hammer at someone without a nail to hit:\n3. Option A, frustration, is a feeling that develops from being unable to complete a task. \n\n4. Option B, boredom, is a state of ennui that arises due to being disengaged from an activity. While a person could be bored from a lack of a nail, it's not the most specific answer that relates to applying a hammers force on someone.\n\n5. Option D, happy, is completely unrelated to the given scenario. It makes no sense that banging a hammer could leave a person with that particular feeling.\n\n6. Thus, we determine that Option C, hurt, is the perfect response for hurting someone with a hammer when they have no nail to hit.\n\nAnswer: C: hurt\n\n### Instructions:Provide your answer to the following multiple choice question using complete sentences.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question asks a person to determine which action they will feel if someone is bangung a hammer without a nail.\n\nThe question implies it is boring if the answer is C.\n\n### Answer:\nSentences: I will feel bored if someone is banging the hammer and does not have a nail.", "answer": "A: cook dinner"}

Choices: 10.0 points A: gold medal B: badge C: trophy medal D: ribbon E: certificate\nRationales: Given question is about what did the person get on their shoes.\n\n1. Gold medal is not exactly matching with the option because we expect a prize in gold in a sports game not on shoes.\n\n2. Badge, trophy medal, ribbon, and certificate might match it but there is not specific order of these prize that fits the question best.\n\n3. However, it fits the most with medal as'medal' has a more flexible range of meaning when comparing with other options.\n\nAnswer B: medal\n\nInput: What action should your team do next if it's late?

Depressed 2. Anger 3. Happy 4. Relief 5. Shame\nRationales: Let's begin by eliminating the options that are not true. Option 2 is not related to the task; he didn't lose a job, so there would not be any possibility of anger. Option 3 also isn't true, as  this person wouldn't be happy to lose his/her job. \nOption 4 is not true, as if we assume that getting relieved about something is not the person's main emotion, we notice that the question is about the primary emotion after the person got fired.\nOption 5 is the correct answer, as the task is asking about the'most' appropriate word.\nAnswer: 5: Shame\n\nInput: Personality traits, which of the following is one? Choices:  Taking action before reviewing  Having a plan  Working hard on your own  Being self aware  Getting along with others\nRationales:\n1.  Eliminate choice B: Having a plan. \n\n2.  In order to choose a 'personality trait', it needs to be an overall way that you present yourself and be identifiable. \n\n3.  Choice C, Working hard on your own, is not necessarily a personality trait that defines a person. \n\n4.  We do need to work on our own often and efficiently, but it is not a personality trait, in the context of the question, which asks to choose one specific trait from 5 options.  This is also why choice D is not the answer, because while self-awareness is often linked to personality and self-concious, it is not a unique trait that can tell much about its owner. \n\n5. Hence, the only option left to choose is choice A, taking action before reviewing. \n\nThere could be multiple explanations for why an option should be eliminated.  \n\nAnswer: A: Taking action before review takes more time\n\nInput: Why you could be on the street, if you're waiting", "answer": "B: names"}

Choices: \nA: paint \nB: repair \nC: hang item \nD: damage \nE: cover up\nRationales: Given the options presented, the person could have painted the wall, repaired it, hung an item on the wall, damaged it or covered it up.\n\nFirst, it is important to understand the various actions implied by painting, repairing, and hanging things on or damaging things.\n\nPainting would be the action of adding something new, namely, paint, to the existing wall.\n\nRepair would be the action of restoring something, in this case, the existing wall, to its original state.\n\nHanging an item onto a wall would be the act of adding an object to the wall.\n\nDamaging a wall would be the process of destroying the wall or something held by the wall.\n\nCovering up something would be the action of putting something (in front of, on, over) the object it seeks to cover.\n\nTherefore, the choice that best fits with this interpretation and the contexts of the question is that of repainting the wall.\n\nAnswer: B: repair\n\nInput: The building had new window treatments on them, they were used to make it look fresh?

Therefore, the choices of 'B' and 'C' fit the requirements to treat a window the most.\nChoices:  A: black \nB: blue \nC: green \nD: orange \nE: yellow F: white.\nRationales: Looking at the choices A to E, we can see that while A to E may fit the description of a color.\n\nOnly A: and E", "answer": "E: hand written"}
{"text": "record is rewriting.\nAnswer:(C): rewrite\n\nInput: What if something that is a liquid is solid? Choices:  Solid A is in the air B in the shape of a cube C is a mass of particles D in the form of a mass E on the ground\nRationales:  1. It is crucial to understand what \"solid\" entails, it could be anything in the shape of a solid mass i.e., particles stuck in a fixed place and not mobile.\n2. The choices, other than a solid, are things in liquid form that are mobile due the presence of water in this scenario. \n3. The choice C, mass of particles, doesn't have the requirement of liquid form in the same manner as choice E. It makes sense conceptually that a mass of particles could be a liquid if they are not stuck in shape and it requires solid as its complementary choice.\n4. On the other hand, the rest of the options don't fit the context or requirements. \n5. Therefore, the best choice is C, mass of particles.\nAnswer: C: mass of particles\n\nInput: Are you able to take off clothes easily? Choices:  Ability is a A: skill  B: physical quality C: ability to lift D: skill to put on items E: strength to pick up\nRationales: First, let's define each word and explore the different forms of the word \"easily\".\n1. Definition: Ability /skill: the quality of being good at doing something.\n2. The first option is skill which fits given the definition.\n3. The second option, A, skill, is redundant and can be eliminated. \n4. There's no such thing as physical quality that relates to clothes so, the third option B, physical quality, isn't correct.\n5. The third definition of 'easily', \"quickly or without difficulty\" doesn't really match the description of the options. However, C, ability to lift, fits.\n6. \"To pick up\" doesn't really fit the current scenario either. It can also be eliminated as an option.\n7. E is the final and correct answer, C, ability to put on, as putting on items does not require strength.\nAnswer: E: skill to put on.\n\nInput: Are they able", "answer": "D: players"}
{"text": "record is the choice C,'rewrite'.\n7.'rewrite' fits, as re-writing could potentially be the outcome of trying to eliminate part of history, as well as the act of getting rid of history.\n8.

Choices: 1: park 2: theater A: the balcony of a large building B: a park C: your backyard D: a bookstore E: an art gallery\nRationales: The first step is to break down the question. \n\n1. We start by analyzing and defining the choices. The choices are the names of various places one might go to watch an art-related movie.\n2. Consider the context, and think about where someone might go to see a movie. It might be in person at a theater, on a device at home, or in a digital format.\n3. Analyzing each individual choice can help us find out the correct option. \n\n4. Place 1: `park`\n5. This option doesn't seem to make sense as a place to see an art-related movie because movies are usually inaccessible outdoors and usually indoors.\n6. Place 2: `theater`\n7. This option is probably the most likely choice because theaters often show art-related movies.\n8. However, the context may not be about watching an art-related movie in a theater, but the context might be about watching art-related movies in general. Movies are sometimes presented in a theater, so this is not necessarily the only opportunity.\n9. Place 3: `the balcony of a building`\n10. This doesn't seem to fit the question because it does not directly name a place where one would go to watch an art film.\n11. Place 4: `your backyard` Also doesn't seem to match up because it is not directly related to a specific place to watch an art movie.\n12. Place 5: `bookstore` is unlikely,", "answer": "E: feelings"}

No ingredients. No meat. No vegetarian options.  Choices:  A No meat B No vegetarian options  C No vegetables D No ingredients E No cooking\nRationales: When looking at the problem, the question asks about the salad and in the options provided, there are multiple things that can be associated with the salad.\n\nThe only one of these options that is specific to the salad is \"cooking\", and that is clearly false because a salad is considered a raw food and salads don't typically need to be cooked.\n\nThe alternatives provided should eliminate more options that should be associated with a cooked salad, and should focus on only the options remaining.\n\nThe remaining options are \"no vegetables\", \"no ingredients\", \"raw or cooked food\", and \"vegetarian\", which can be broken down into similarities.\n\n\"No vegetables\" and \"no ingredients\" involve only raw food or vegetable.\n\nTherefore, the correct option \"no vegetables\" should be selected.\nAnswer: A no meat\n\nInput: Where do you get food if you are at McDonald's on a weekend?

Choices:  * A: chocolate chips  B: vanilla C: blueberries D: lemon extract E: whipped cream\nRationales: The meaning is clearly describing someone buying an ingredient which they will use to add to whatever dessert they're making.\n\nThe question can be understood either way, as either a request for more something or a question to describe the situation of how there is more of whatever is being described.\n\n1. Option A: *\"chocolate chips\" *can be a suitable option, but it isn' think more of something than some other kind of desert.\n2. Similar to A, option B: *\"vanilla\" *can be a solution but it won't be enough to have this ingredient in more than its current amount.\n3. Option C: *\"blueberries\" *would definitely be enough to have more, but it won't work with the current question.\n4. Option D, *\"lemon extract\" *can be an option as it is more of the same, but it is unlikely to be the most important ingredient.\n5. Option E: *\"whipped cream\" *would be an option if the desert the person is making is made with whipped cream. \n6.

{"text": "record is 'erasing history'.\nAnswer: D: erase\n\nInput: Is there way you can store data on USB without formatting? Choices:  yes A: no B: never C: yes D: never E: yes\nRationales: The question is asking about whether is there a way to store data on a USB (USB - it doesn't mention storage media) without formatting. It has to do with USB drives, so there is no choice that involves only formatting.\n\nStep 1: Examine the options.\n\nStep 2 (A, B and C): These three options are contradictory, since you can't both format and store data, since 'formatting' is done for erasing and preparing hard drive. So, these can be eliminated. So, we are left with just two choices: A and E.\n\nStep 0 (D and E): None of these answers refer to formatting, so they are possible. \n\nStep (3): 'Yes, format your drive' - formatting your drive can help you store data, so this is a possible answer.\n\nStep (4): Answer that fits is option 'Yes' - It can be formatted without actually erasing the data (in the sense that files don't go away), and yes, you can store data on a flash-drive without formatting. \n\nStep E: The question is 'without formatting', so this option can be eliminatd.\n\nStep (5): 'Yes' makes the most sense in this context, since data can be stored without formatting but cannot be formatted without doing changes to drive. \n\nStep F: You should never format a usb without first verifying everything about it, for this is a destructive/drastic change to storage and it changes it to basic usb without even verifying if it will function properly. \n\nComment: @Bill Lee can I get the rationale for every choice?

{"text": "record is 'trying to erase history'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: They are on holiday, what is probably what they are doing? Choices: \nA: going to the doctor B: flying C: traveling via the water D: getting married E: waiting at the airport\nRationales: There are two clues for considering different options for the following question.\n1. The first, 'They are on holiday' has a clear relationship to the different options and helps narrow down the scope of the answer.\n2. The second clue, 'They are', tells us whether the object is being used as a direct object, an indirect object, the subject of the sentence, etc. In this case, they is clearly being used as an indirect object, which narrows our thinking to just 'Their travel plans' (where travel could be the subject of a sentence).\n3. Once we can identify the role of 'their' in the sentence, the next step is to consider whether it is feasible for the sentence to contain information about an object that isn't mentioned before the preposition their.\n4. This is where we can eliminate options A and B, which do not make sense because they are related to different types of movement such as travel by air or water.\n5. Likewise, options D and E don't make sense because they indicate waiting or traveling to an airport or hotel, not necessarily traveling using a particular mode of transport.\n6. Finally, option C matches the specifications of the answer because 'traveling via the water' makes sense when we narrow down the scope of our possibilities by eliminating similar-sounding options like 'traveling from the water' and 'traveling over water.'\nAnswer: C: traveling via water\n\nInput: Who is helping a child to paint a painting?Choices:  A: parent B: teacher C: auntie D: grandmother E: friend\nRationales: The best answer is C, grandmother.

The child is not going to be painting the picture with their parent since this parent will be helping the child paint a painting.

Family members may be nearby, but typically do not \"see\" readers, especially when seated to read.\n3. The answer is not B: dog. A dog may be nearby, and readers would typically see dogs, but not during a period of reading.\n4. The answer is not C: teacher, D: doctor, or E: store.

Breakfast or lunch would not be considered a \"meal\", so it is not a correct option.\n4. A family often would not be \"making\" a snack because snacks are a small and often unplanned (not made) portion of food, as opposed to \"meals\".\n5.

Choices:  C: lobby D: inside the room E: bathroom F: hallway\nRationales: Start by analyzing each available option.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate choices A and B. As options, these are not specific enough to answer the question. Also, an examination of a doctor is done with tools that go inside the body, so A & B do not apply.\n\nStep 2. We now consider C, lobby, which may seem like a perfect place for an examination. Certainly, a lobby is a space where a variety of activities, including examinations, are possible. However, C, lobby does not answer the question about the room.\n\nStep  3: Let's move on to D, which is the inside the room option. It has been assumed the room is being asked about. However, the given choices are not specific enough so we cannot say for sure it's the correct answer.\n\nNext, consider E, bathroom, as a place that may be involved in an examination. While it might be possible for an examination to include activities that take place in a bathroom, it is not specific enough to say that bathrooms are examination rooms.\n\nAdditionally, since we have only chosen items that are inside rooms so far, we eliminate F, which is outside the room. \n\nConclusion: \n\nStep 8, as the remaining options are D (inside the room) and C (lobby), we go back to step 2 and examine D, inside the room. This option captures what is needed for the question and eliminates C, which is not what the question is asking for. \nAnswer: D: inside the room", "answer": "A: shelf"}

B: into the gills 3. C: throughout the body 4. D: out the tank 5. E: inside the stomach 6. F: with more food\n\nRationales:  1. The question asks where dirt goes when a fish tank is clean.\n\n2. An option is 'in and with more food'. This choice does neither directly or indirectly reflect any action related to fish tanks. \n\n3. Another option is 'out the tank'. However, this option suggests that cleaning a tank is not enough and the tank needs to be disposed of. This doesn't match the question as the focus is on the dirt getting out of the tank. \n\n4. One further choice is 'out the mouth'. This option suggests that waste is released outside the body and doesn't specifically relate to tanks.\n\n5. While the remaining options have clear physical or contextual relevance to a fish tank, option 'out the stomach' is the correct one as dirt, in terms of waste produced by fish, would enter the fish's stomach, and from there, would either be eliminated or digested.

All of them are items that could be used to cover a body, similar to blankets. Thus, the correct option is: a. blanket.\nSteps 4 to 6: The last option is to identify the correct option from the remaining four given options. At a quick glance, it might seem that coats and tablets would be correct choices for this exercise.\nSteps 7 to 9: But, we can eliminate these options because the key criterion is what would be put at a place for \u2018storage\u2019 \u2013 and \u2018covering someone\u2019 does not meet this criterion.\nSteps 10 to 12: We can eliminate books and tablets as they do not have a physical cover.\nSteps 8 to 12: This leaves canoes and coats.\nStep 13: To narrow down our options further, we ask ourselves if the choices are in the right part of the spectrum. For example, is the answer on the left or right of the spectrum?\nStep 14: In this case, let us consider the first three options, which involve covers, and the last two, which involve coats and canoes.\nStep 15: This leaves two choices, coat and canoe.\nStep 16: Finally, we can determine the correct answer is coat.\nAnswer: A: Coat\n\nInput: Where would you store a book?

Hence, it may be most logical to relate this to stealing material items.\n\nThe action of'stealing jewelry' is more likely to occur based on common associations of an action.

Choices: A: because their spouse said nice things B: they want more things\nC: they're embarrassed D: the other person said mean things E: they feel bad\nRationales: First, we should eliminate choices that aren't true reasons for someone to feel upset.\n\nIn this case, we can discard options 'B' and 'D', as these aren't feelings which naturally result in emotional distress. 'B' implies that someone wants to get what they cannot get, but we cannot infer that this causes someone to feel bad about themselves. Similarly, 'D' states that they feel bad because of someone else, but these feelings aren't necessarily negative since you can be upset with a person without being upset about yourself.\n\n'C' can be eliminated because someone shouldn't be upset only because they are embarrassed. 'C' could be related to an embarrassing situation, but embarrassment alone is not a justifiable reason for someone to feel upsets.\n\n'E' can be discarded because being upset with someone else for saying mean things isn't a direct, internal cause of an emotional upset. In other words, the negative feeling of being upset is not a result of someone else's negative thoughts about yourself.\n\nNow, you are left with only option 'A'. There are still a few more options to analyse further.\n\n'B' could be a related reason, but an objectively nicer situation shouldn't make someone feel bad by itself.\n\n'A' clearly states why one feels bad.

{"text": "record is option E, \"erase\".\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: Where would you expect to find a chainsaw? Choices:  D: garage  A: work shop B: yard C: shed D: house E: wood pile\nRationales: Start by analyzing each of the choices against the question.\n\nFirst, let's examine D: garage. This isn't an optimal answer because garages are unlikely to contain chainsaws.\n\nNext, consider A: workshop. A workshop is a place where tools are often kept and used, but this wouldn't necessarily be for a chainsaw.\n\nB: yard can be a possible answer, but usually, it contains a garden, not a chainsaw. Also, it doesn't indicate a 'expect'.\n\nC: shed is a possible location, especially if it is used on a property, and contains various tools, but that isn't the main point of the question.\n\nNext, let's analyze D: house. This is an acceptable choice if 'expect' means a general, frequent expectation, but that isn' been stated, so it's hard to say.\n\nNow, let's consider E: wood pile. This is an acceptable answer if 'expect' means frequent, because wood piles typically contain items used for cutting, or chopping. Some use machinery to cut down trees and create wood piles.\nA: work shop is another acceptable answer. But, if 'expect to find' means frequently, then that's a better, more definitive answer.\nTherefore the answer is C: shed.\n\nAnswer: C: shed\n\nInput: When will people come to the place where they like to hang at? Choices:  E: Saturday  A: last Friday B: Tuesday C: Sunday D: Wednesday E: Monday\nRationales: Let's first consider E: Saturday. Although people do go on this day, it doesn't mean they go on a weekly basis, or that they like to hang out there.\n\nNow, consider D: Wednesday, this is also a potential choice, because it is mid-week and therefore, some people might hang out there.\n \nNext, let' choose C: Sunday, although it's a common day for people to hang out", "answer": "A: neighbor's house"}

{"text": "record is'rewrite history'.\nAnswer: B: tape\n\nInput: An activity where one would be in a dark room alone, and they make something. Choices:  A. reading B. driving C. painting D. writing E. singing\nRationales: In this question, the goal is to identify an activity that takes one to a dark room and is solitary in nature. Considering each option, it is important to understand what they describe, and how they are linked to a person's identity, preferences, and abilities.\nOption A,'reading', is not an activity that brings one to a dark room. Secondly, it does not require the person to be alone, as a reader could be reading with someone else.\nChoice B, 'driving', is the activity which takes one to the dark room, though one may be in the company of another person.\nChoices C, D, and E all involve the production of something, and hence can be considered choices if one is making something. In this question, we need to analyze which option more likely involves going to a dark room and being alone during this activity. Of the three choices that could meet these requirements, C, 'painting', and E,'singing', are not in the options. Painting is an activity linked to artistic expression which could be accomplished in private, but does not necessarily mean a complete dark room. Choice D, 'writing', is possibly the answer choice. It takes one to a dark space, can be solitary, and could involve making an artifact (the writing itself is the making process).\nTherefore, the best fit for this question is D, 'writing'.\nAnswer: D: writing\n\n### Output:Insult: It's best to pick at your nose in public with other's company around. Correct Option: Choice D: writing.\n\n### Credits:The solution was contributed by https://github.com/GerardoRosete.", "answer": "A: botanical garden"}

If it can be eaten it can also serve as an ingrediant of the 'thing we can eat'.\n\nStep 3.

Choices:  D: natural B: surgical A: medicinal C: herbal E: physical\nRationales: A medicinal cure is an inactive or passive remedy that, usually, is a part of a treatment plan. It doesn't require action that is outside of the body of the patient; thus, it is a cure by nature.\n\nA herbal cure is also a passive remedy that doesn't require any action outside of the natural healing process.\n\nA physical cure is typically a treatment that involves a surgical procedure to remove the cause of the disease.

Choices:  C: bank B: hotel D: police station E: bar\nRationales: The answer must be a place where there is an opportunity to take a ticket. In this context, that means a place where there are tickets that people can take. There are plenty of places where you can get tickets. We can eliminate: A: bank. You can get a ticket from a bank, but you can also get a ticket at a train station or other location where there are a variety of tickets available. C: hotel. Hotels give a key as a ticket. Again, a hotel also can give its customers other kinds of tickets. We can also eliminate: D: police station. A police station doesn't have any tickets to give or take. E: bar. You can order a drink at a bar, but to buy it, you'll have to hand your money over and the bartender will give you a ticket to keep.

Choices:  D: It is always correct C: It is 24 hours DFS: 1 hour FDS: 1 minute FDD: 1 day\nRationales: In this word problem, there is a difference between a clock, 'C', that is not on time and the clock, 'D', that is on time. So, 'It is always correct' describes the 'D' clock which is on time and the FSDF clock is the time that is not on time. Let's look at each letter in the sentence. Let's start with 'D' clock, 'D'. The difference is that it is on time. So now, let's go to the second letter of the acronym, 'C'. The difference is that the clock is not on time and now the 'FSDF'. The difference is that one is not on time and one is, however, the 'D' is the correct letter. Therefore, D is the correct answer. But if I was to use words in the sentence, it would be 'It is always correct'.\nAnswer: D: It is always right", "answer": "C: criticism"}

Choices:  D: tires B: handlebars C: air filter D: shock absorber E: fenders F: wheels\nRationales: The given options are about the parts affected by the repair. 1. All the given options can affect a bike in a way that is considered 'broken'.\n2. 'Wheels' generally cannot become flat because they are always round. Also, 'wheels' do not generally have a tube (like a tire does), so it is not something that can be inflated either.\n3. The only option that can be identified with something that happens regularly during a bike repair is 'tube'. \n4. This is because 'tube' is the part that can easily become flat, deflate, or otherwise ruin during a bicycle repair.\n5. Therefore, 'tubes' may be considered the best answer.  Answer: Tire: B: Handlebar: D: Shock Absorber: E: Air Filter\n\nInput: What do you use to put oil on your bike? Choices:  C: rake B: wrench D: fork A: brush E: oar\nRationales: A: brush- this is the correct answer. 1. The given options are about how to add oil.\n2.

When somebody suffers an injury, and you see it, and you don't help him/her, by no means, they are a coward, they are unconscious coward and it is a cowardice because it was unconscious. There is nothing the person did wrong, just unconscious.\n\n(2) And \"Yes\" is the correct answer to B, C, and E.\n\nThey were not really coward.

A: [person]. This means that in the answer choices, 'person', 'event', 'object', 'thing', and 'place' represent particular items that could apply to a situation like the one described and be relevant. A 'person' could be crying for lots of reasons, for example they just witnessed the death of a family member.\n2. B: [event]. Events could be traumatic like someone's home catching fire. This could make someone cry too, as could a break-up. \n3. C:[object]. It's unlikely that an object could make you cry. An object could be associated with a feeling, like having a special picture with a person who recently died.\n4. [thing]. It's improbable that a thing can make you cry. Though it's possible, for example it could be that someone is extremely attached to their pet and is upset at the prospect of having to have to get rid of it.\n5. D: [place]. Places could be emotional for a person. For example, they might be really sad to move away from a special place like their childhood home they grew up in.\nAnswer: B.

The example question given to us is question (a). The answer is the fact that the word \"is\" is capitalized. The rest of the sentence does not include the word", "answer": "B: think"}

Choices:  a: the eyes b: the nose c: the ears d: the mouth\nRationales: The question requires us to identify and pick the person that is referred to here.\n\n1. a: no one refers to the person but rather to the part of their body which includes the brain and is not a common person.\n\n2. b: the nose is the only body part which does not seem likely to use their eyes.\n\n3. c: the ears are the only part of the body which can not \"use their eyes\".

Choices: a. family reunion b. class c. game show d. census e. census\nRationales: We have to choose the word which is most similar to the event called.\n\n1. The event is referring to a get-together or a gathering with people who share the same last name.\n\n2. An alternative is 'class' which is an educational group gathering for a session.\n\n3. 'Game show' is a bit far from the original meaning and would require further questioning for an explanation as to why it is connected to the original word.\n\n4. 'Government census' is an event but one which does not require same-last-name people.\n\n5. This leaves us with family reunion and census as the most appropriate answers.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: What does the bride call the person who will soon be her husband?

{"text": "record is'rewrite history'.\nAnswer: D: rewrite history\n\nInput: When you see a person who is not a man or a woman they are _____. Choices:  A. homosexual B. heterosexual C. neither D. transgender E. unknown\nRationales: In this context, the word \"see\" means to observe someone physically, which gives the correct understanding of this question to \"determine whether they are a man or a woman\". It is also important to note that the other words (hetero and homo) come from the Greek word for \"the same\" which is \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2. When speaking of sexual orientation, either \"The Same\" or \"Others\" mean sexual attraction. Therefore, it is correct to only use the words \"heterosexual\" and \"homosexual\". Furthermore, transgender refers to a person whose sense of gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth, or do not identify as exclusively male or female. This does not mean that the person is homo or hetero oriented; it is simply an identification of personal preference.", "answer": "B: learn about"}

Choices: 1: tell them 2: file complaint 3: tell them 4: file complaint 5: tell them 6: file complaint 7: tell them 8: file complaint 9: tell them 10: file complaint\nRationale: 1. We should examine the phrases offered in each of the five sets.\n2. The first set mentions 'customer service,' this should narrow the focus.\n3. Of the given choices, only the first two are talking about customer service.\n4. 'Tell them' is an action we can take if we aren't satisfied with customer service. That's why a)1 fits as the only choice given with focus on customer service.\n5. 'File complaint' and 'tell them' should not be included for the same reason.\n6. The remaining choices are repetitive and unrelated to one-another.\n7. Therefore the best solution is a)1.\nAnswer: A)1\n\nInput: What was likely to be in the room if it's where it should be? Choices: 3: a chair 4: a shelf 5: a bed 6: some food 7: a mattress 8: a rug 9: a sofa 10: a desk\nRationale: 0. Consider the question:\n1. The question talks about a specific room, we have to identify what that room probably should contain.\n2. The options are not all objects that can be used in a room but it can be ruled out that there is no chair, bed, and desk.\n3. Each of the given objects has a particular use and may not be included if there isn't a place to store or put it in.\n4. It seems like a mattress, which could go on a bed or be on a sofa for someone to sit on, would be a likely object to be in a room if it's a place it should be.\n5. A desk, a rug and a chair are also likely for a room to be if it's a specific place.\n6. Therefore the object that should be in the room is most likely to be a", "answer": "C: injury"}

Choices:  C: 2,8 D: 10,4 E: 6,6 F: 4,12 G: 3,10 H: 5,10 I: 10,8 J: 1,12\nRationales:\n1. First, we must define which conditions must be met in order to not have doubles. The game must have 16 pieces, and the sum of all of them must be equal to 16.\n2. From 2 to 1 are all possibilities, because adding all sums will give the game 16 with no doubles.\n3. The first sum must be added to another, and so on to complete the whole game.\n4. The game is made with the lowest possible sum, because if the sum is twice higher and the number of pieces is 16, the game will have 32 values and the remaining pieces will be doubsles.\n5. The smallest sum available will be 3 + 2 = 5, that is 5,3,1, and we already know that 2 sums is 5, so 5", "answer": "C: own family"}

However calculator, calendar, and messaging are not very relevant to taking a photo, and we aren't even given a picture in this case.

Choices:  E F A D C\nRationales:\n\nFor E, the sequence is correct, so the logical choice, based on the order rule in the question, is E.\n\nWe can rule out A, C, and D as they aren't ordered in the given sequence.\n\nNext, C is ruled out for the same reason.\n\nBased on this, the only remaining answer choices are E and F.\n\nA is a letter that is the same length as D, making C and D logically the same length.\n\nIf we compare E and F they both have one more letter than C, making E and F also logically the same length\n\nTherefore, the only logically correct answer choice is E, meaning E can assume both a position and an order.\n\nInput: We can see something for what?

Choices: \tA: side of street B: front porch C: restaurant D: dog shelter E: dog park\nRationales: By analyzing each option, we can quickly get the correct answer. Option A, which says on the side of the street, may not work because a sidewalk does not always have signs. Option D cannot be correct because a dog shelter does not usually have signs outside. Option C cannot be correct either, because one would typically go to find a restaurant to eat in and not to see a sign. In comparison, option E, The Dog Park, works because one would be in a dog park to see the sign. Therefore, the correct answer is E = Dog Park.\n\nInput: What do you eat at if you are sitting outside on a bench?

{"text": "record is 'erase' as this represents a figurative way to cover up or get rid of some part of history. \n7. Another option that fits this interpretation is'rewrite'. While this is not the primary purpose, burnings and writings can have the same function for hiding or concealing something.\n8. Since there are two that fit the analogy, the options to eliminate are 'compact disc' and 'play'.\n9. Compact discs are associated with compact disc players, which are machines, not a person's intention to cover up part of history. 10. This is similar with 'playing music'. It is not the literal action behind burning a record.\n11. The choice left is 'erase' that is best connected to burning records to cover up history.\nAnswer: A : erase\n\nInput: You're not getting gas, why? Choices:  You only have cash, You only have a card. Choices:  A : Cash  B : Card\nRationales: This is another question that involves deciding which response is best, given clues.\n1. The phrase used is 'You're not getting gas'. This implies the subject is having or would be having difficulty getting gas.\n2. The word 'gas' could refer to fuel or energy and these both mean the same thing here.\n3. In the context, the subject is a vehicle.\n4. Looking at the choices, it is obvious that 'card' is not a place to fill vehicle tanks, hence it is not an acceptable response.\n5. Similarly, the phrase 'you only have' means that the subject doesn't have what they need or what they should have otherwise.\n6. Therefore the options that fit this interpretation is 'only have a card', which fits the context of 'card' referring to something to 'fill' the tanks.\nAnswer: B : Card\n\nInput: It's in the trash, it shouldn't be on your shoes.

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: How was the dog able to run through the hole it had made? Choices: \n\nRationales: The question presents an obvious problem; the dog was able to run through a hole or opening in a fence. To solve this problem, we must consider how the dog could have accessed the hole to make it.\n\n1. Let's analyze each option to evaluate which one fits the problem.\n\n2. Option A: 'compact disc', does not fit with the problem because the dog does not make, access, or use a compact disc.\n\n3. Similarly, option B: 'tape' cannot correspond to the problem at hand because dogs do not make, access, and especially use tapes.\n\n4. Option C:'rewrite' does not satisfy the solution either since it is not used with dogs.\n\n5. Option D: 'play music' presents a musical scenario where dogs interact with music, but it is not directly applicable.\n\n6. Finally, option E: 'erase', is the only option that provides insight to how a dog can access a hole. We know that erasing is associated with removing things (like erasing data), so this is most likely the correct choice.\n\nAnswer: E: Erasing\n\nInput: How is person probably feeling with the new information? Choices:  C: sad D: relieved E: shocked F: ecstatic\nRationales: This question is asking about an emotion someone may feel when given new information. To determine this sentiment, we must consider how information affects an individual's emotional state.\n\n1. To start, let's analyze the question. Here, the option that refers to the new information that has been given is 'C: sad'. This can be eliminated because there are no new facts given in the context, only a change to the situation.\n2. Next, let's evaluate the options that don't specifically reference something new: 'E: shocked', 'F: ecstatic'. While these options would produce emotional responses due to new information, they don't directly speak to that idea. For instance, if someone was surprised that their friend was no longer around, they may feel both shocked and sad.\n3. Finally, we can determine that 'D: relieved' is the correct answer", "answer": "E: jump"}

This can be deduced by considering the following: dogs are typically found in animal shelters and animal control facilities. Basset hounds, chow chows, and poodle puppies are often overlooked and not adopted in animal shelters because they are less popular, so they are most likely to be found in bars.\nStep 3. Based on the observations the answer can be deduced to be: C: Basset hounds\nAnswer: C: Basset Hounds\n\nInput: What was the first time this girl had seen the snow?

Which of these time frames would make sense in context from the question? Since the girl was in a store while there was snow on the ground.\n\nStep 9. A: Christmas happens once a year and does not apply as the first time one girl could see snow.\nStep 10. B: Halloween would have to include snow for the first time.\n\nStep \t11.

The key to solving this question is to identify the word in the description that is different from the words in the options.\n2. First, we should examine the given alternatives.\n3. 'A coat' and 'D clothing' are not phrases used to describe an action that puts one thing on another. 'B','something', or 'else' are also not such phrases.\n4. 'C', someone, can be related to the phrase that describes the action in the prompt. However, 'C' could also be a completely unrelated answer as 'C' is a person not a thing. It could be related, but is not an absolute match.\n5. 'E' is also an answer choice that 'clothes' or 'fabric' are part of, but it is also too vague as 'fabric' can be placed on anything.\n6.

Choices:  a): walking on a flat surface, b,): sliding, c): moving, d): being on the other side, e): standing\nRationales: Choice a) presents the idea of walking on a flat surface. The bridge serves to connect two places whereas walking moves one place to the other. So, walking on the bridge and walking on a flat surface would both lead to change in place. Hence, walking on the bridge cannot be the answer to the question.\n\nChoice b) presents the idea of sliding on a surface. Being on the bridge and sliding on the surface would both lead to staying in the same place or going slower. Choice b) cannot be the answer\n\nChoice c) presents the idea of moving. The bridge connect two places that are disconnected by a body of water so moving from one place to the other is necessary. Hence, moving would be an accurate description of being on the bridge.\n\nOption d) presents the idea of being on another side. Option e) presents the idea of standing on a flat surface. Hence, being on the bridge cannot be equivalent to being on a flat surface, as you are neither sliding, nor are you on another side. The only choices that fit the description of being on a bridge would be a) moving and c) being on the bridge. Hence, the correct answer would be b) moving, because both the description and the answer coincide.\n\nAnswer: b) moving\n\nInput: In the movie, is the door locked when the kid gets home?

Specifically, what is 'average' and what attributes describe individuals with'more than average income and time on their hands'.\n2. To determine this, one can evaluate each choice and determine if it is reasonable.\n3. Answers B through D do not match the context of the question in that they either are about what is average, have the same average as what was specified, or not related to the concept at all.\n4. Choice E is also not a match in the sense that it is incomparable to the provided scenario.\n5. Choice A is the best option as it most relates to the given context, in that both 'average income' and 'average time on hands' are a measure that can be exceeded.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: What can you use to help you decide where to go? Choices: \u00a0\u00a0A: weather forecast B: compass C: phone D: alarm clock E: map\nRationales: By interpreting context\n1. It is clear that they are asking what one can use to help one decide where to go.\n2. The answer choices are: weather forecast, compass, phone, alarm clock, and map.\n3. From the given scenario, only choice (D) is relevant here. Since the context is about journey, it is reasonable to deduce that choice (D) is the correct answer because an alarm clock would be handy to wake one up.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: What's it good to do in the morning?

Choices:  B: minutes C: days D: minutes E: hours\nRationales: After the key is pressed, the typing time is still the same. If you were to go away from the keyboard, you can return to continue typing as many times you want. \n\nThe longest time would be after the last letter you want to type in. There is no fixed timing.\n\nInput: Where do you usually listen to music when you take a ride in an airplane? Choices:  C: in your home A: on your smartphone B: your radio D: no response\nRationales:\n\n1. Listening to music in a plane can be done when the plane is ascending or descending. \n\n2. As you're listening, the plane is ascending and descending.\n3. As you listen, you're not on your home, therefore you're not listening right there. \n\n4. Listening to music when you're at home is not the action of listening to music when you have taken a plane ride.\n5. The plane does not have a smartphone or a radio either.\n6. The correct answer is B: your radio.\n\nAnswer: B: your radio\n\nInput: What do you use to wash off a shampoo? Choices:  D: water E: conditioner F: soap B: shampoo G: lather\nRationales: All of the available options are correct and are used frequently. The goal is to determine which option best describes the action of \"washing off\" a shampoo.\n\n1. Water is the best choice. While conditioner and lather would come into play if using conditioner on wet hair, water is the best choice to wash a shampoo off. Water could also be used with shampoo and/or conditioner.\n 2.

{"text": "record would be 'erasure'.\nAnswer: A: compact disc\n\nInput: What did the dog want? Choices: A: to get the cookie B: to be outside C: to be given D: to be treated \nRationales:1. This question requires analyzing the choices based on their suitability to answer who specifically the dog wanted, or who it was directed at.\n2. A: To get the cookie suggests an inanimate object and isn't directed at anyone in particular. This option can be eliminated for now.\n3. B: To be outside suggests that the question is asking to identify what the dog wants or who wants it, but this can be eliminated based on its broadness and insinuating that the dog itself might is seeking the cookie.\n4. C: to be given suggests that the cookie is desired or given to someone in particular, but doesn't specify more details, so even though this is the most applicable choice, based on the prompt, it has to be rejected.\n5. D: to be treated says \"to identify who the question being directed at\", but can still be eliminated as again this is not a specific item or action that the dog wants or is meant to be directed at.\n6. Based on the analyses the only remaining choice is to be directed at which is \"to identify who the dog actually wants the cookie\".\nAnswer: D: to be given\n\nInput: What does the man do at the market with milk and cheese? Choices: A. He eats cheese. B. He takes the milk to his house. C. He gives the cheese away. D. He takes the cheese and milk back to his house. E: He mixes the milk and cheese.\n\n1. First, let us understand the question carefully.\n2. It asks the action he takes with milk and cheese, it doesn't ask him to perform a specific act with the two ingredients.\n3. It can be seen that 'He mixes milk and cheese.' doesn't make sense as one can never put milk and cheese together, they have no relation to the other, unlike 'He mixes salt and water'.\n4. Similarly, 'He eats cheese' and 'Take the milk to his house' are both not viable as they involve mixing the ingredients together.\n5. The only", "answer": "C: city"}
{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: B: tape\n\nInput: On what do you use tape for a book and booklet? Choices: 1. A: headlights B: carpet 2. A: tires C: shutter D: trunk E: seat\nRationales: Starting with 2, we have tires, which can never be a reason for using tape on a book or booklet and thus eliminated.\nConsidering 1, we have \"headlights\" and \"carpet\" which can also be eliminated for the same reason and are not a suitable matching for using tape on book and booklet.\nThen we analyze C, \"shutter\" which is used to cover a window's pane for purposes of protecting the room from sunlight. For the same reason, it cannot be used as a reason for using tapes on book and booklet and thus the eliminated.\nThen the only two choices \"trunk\" and \"seat \" can be tested for their purpose that they hold stuffs and is related to their storage function. Thus it suggests that it is related to a functional use of the car's interior or storage space. \nFurthermore, the question stated that we use \"tape\" in book and booklet rather than the car's tires, thus it only leaves the choice between \"trunk\" and  \"seat\". This has to be confirmed by checking whether tape is used in \"trunk\" or \"seat\".\nIf tape is used in both of the two choices, then this is a redundant choice and thus eliminated. According to the question, tape is used on book and booklet, thus it cannot be used in trunk or seat for books.\nSo  \"trunk\" is the answer. \nAnswer: 1. A & 2.

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: D: erase\n\nInput: What type of a job could one apply to use their skill? Choices: 1. A: job B: worker C: work D: position E: team\nRationales:\n1. The statement uses an analogy with the word'skill' to apply for a job that may be the most appropriate option.\n2. By using 'apply' as an action with an implication, the statement tries to imply that applying for a skill implies that it's linked to something.\n3. While 'position' is an interesting option, jobs that apply for positions are usually for higher-level or long-term jobs.\n4. 'Team' is definitely not linked to applying for a skill; this is the type of position of groups in the same job or task.\n5. So, based on the action of applying a skill, the most logical and fitting choice is 'job'.\nAnswer: A: job\n\nInput: How could one be given credit for the time that they spend on a job? Choices: \t1. A: raise in salary 2. B: bonus 3. C: extra days off 4. D: better work 5. E: paid internships\nRationales: The answer is C: extra days off or pay raise \n\nThis question is asking for the type of situation where one can get additional compensation for the hard work they put into their job.\n\nEach of the given options could potentially be related to this situation, but each has different connotations and context based on the wording used.\n\n'Raise in salary' likely refers to an increase in compensation for an average job.\n\nBut, a pay raise could also refer to an increase in compensations for certain projects or additional work.\n\n'Bonus' has more of a connection to reward or payment for hard work, but it's less directly related to the wording used in the question.\n\nThe question asks for receiving a credit for the hard work, specifically in terms of the time spent.  \n'Bonus in compensation' is not relevant to this question and makes us less inclined to eliminate any of the other options. \n\nThe question continues to ask specifically about the time spent on a job, so the specificity of time spent does not require a bonus in", "answer": "D: happiness"}

Consider 'B: parking lot' that's a place where you park your car for short periods of time. One doesn't normally drive around in a parking lot looking for parking spots.\n3. 'C: roads' is a place where you can go and drive but they're typically longer than a local street. \n4. 'D: interstate' is more descriptive of a highway where people typically drive faster than other types of roads. It is typically longer than road so one wouldn't spend much time driving.\n5. 'E: mall' is not really a place to drive cars - most places are prohibited from driving inside malls.\n\n6.

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: D: erase\n\nInput: What does the person do before taking an exam? Choices:  C: write the test D: take the test E: do research\nRationales: Considering the choice, we should examine each option to determine which is related most closely in the given context to what the person is doing before taking the test / exam.\n1. 'Write the test' could likely be one thing people do before taking an exam.\n2. However, this activity could be seen as a separate action and does not necessarily need to happen before the taking of the exam.\n3. Also, if one is writing an essay it doesn't mean that it is one's last essay. We could see writing an essay as a preemptive measure to improve scores on an exam. But this is not a requirement.\n4. So, while 'write the test' is still an answer, it is not necessarily the correct answer.\n5. 'Take the test' could be seen as being synonymous to testing oneself and taking an exam.\n6. Similarly to the preceeding choice, while it is an activity that occurs on an exam, it doesn't need to happen before the exam.\n7. This choice suggests that one is taking an exam but doesn't say what comes prior.\n8. Similarly, with 'do research', while it is a preemptive activity that can go into preparation for an exam, it still doesn't mention what one could potentially perform beforehand.\n9. The only option that indicates an action that is commonly taken beforehand during or after an exam is 'prepare for an exam' which is the correct answer. \n\nAnswer: C: prepare for an exam\n\nInput: If a business has the choice between buying a cheaper stock and saving a couple of hundred dollars, and buying the superior stock and saving them four hundred dollars, they should do which?

A: Gum means someone would be going to the store for chewing gum, or perhaps, flavored gum (such as bubble gum).\n\n2. B: Bread means a person would be heading to the store for either a loaf of bread or baked goods.\n\n3. C: Shampoo means a person would be going to the market for shampoo.\n\n4. D: Toilet paper means a person would be running to the market to get toilet paper.\n\n5. E: Water means a person would be needing to go the market to purchase water, or other necessities in the form of water. It may also imply that a person may need to go to a market to buy a water bottle or refill water bottles.\n\n6. F: Cough medicine means a person may be needing to go to the store to purchase cough medicine or acetaminophen, or if they already have it, they would be refilling it.\n\nFurther analyze each option to pinpoint their relevance to the question.\n\n7. A: Gum is associated with chewing. There are specific things to buy within this category. Therefore, gum isn't necessary a \"why\" for the person's trip to the market, i.e., there is no purpose. \n\n8. B: Bread has many purposes, including for toasting, feeding animals, making sandwiches, etc. To consider a more specific purpose, you'd choose baked goods. It's possible to buy baked goods at a market, the problem is that this is not a specific purpose for buying bread.\n\n9. C: Sham poo seems", "answer": "D: cease fire"}
{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: D: play music\n\nInput: She found the diamond, what could be taken from the box? Choices:  B: bracelet A: watch C: glasses D: earrings E: necklace \n\nRationales: In this statement, we can use the knowledge about the object to infer about the meaning.\n\nIf an item is inside a box, then only other smaller items are able to be taken from the box.\nGiven the context, since the statement says that a diamond was found in the box, we know that other larger objects can't be taken out, unless they're put in another, smaller, box.\n\nTherefore, answer C, glasses, can definitely be taken from the box, but not the other answers, because they're too big.\n\nWe can also eliminate some of the options which are too big to be taken from the original box: B, A, D, E.\nOnly option D, earrings, is a small enough object to be taken from the same box.\n\nAnswer: C: Glasses\n\nInput: She dug a hole, what was she trying to plant? Choices:  D: pear B: apple C: flower E: tree F: vegetable G: water\n\nRationales 1. This is another situation where we need to infer the meaning of the text and make a logical deduction based on the context.\n\nWe're told that something was planted, but that doesn't necessarily mean an actual plant, as some other larger objects could also be planted.\n2. Based on the text, we can understand that it was planted in the ground.\n\nSince the object that was planted is larger than her hand, it wasn't a plant.\n\nIt was also planted in the ground, which means she was probably digging a hole to put it in.\n\nTherefore the answer should be A: Pear.\n\nAnswer: A: Pear\n\n### Difficulty: Level 2\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following question using the options in the question.\n\n##Instruction:Answer the following decision tree question.\n\n##Decision tree:Answer the following decision-tree question.\n\n##Example:\n\nInput: What can you be thinking of if", "answer": "A: seaside town"}

Choices: 1: A: wait for an elevator B: ask a doctor C: order the coffee D: do homework E: go to work\nRationales:\n1. Here, the subject of \"they\" may represent anyone.\n2. The question presents a general question that asks about what can't be done all the time.\n3. Considering each option individually, option A, waiting for an elevator is something that can be done any time since elevators can be used any time and in case of being delayed, most buildings have multiple elevators.\n4. In option B, waiting can be applied to waiting for a doctor, but in most cases, you could call the doctor's office or take a different mode of transport to reach them in time if an appointment is missed. Hence, option B is not the best answer.\n5. In option C, ordering coffee is possible at all times, 24 hours a day.\n6. The only remaining option is option D: Doing homework. Doing homework is something that is done all the time, but it is not always possible to do them at a particular time since homework can be assigned daily.\n7. Therefore the right answer is: E: go to work.\n\nInput: What makes a good team player?  Choices: A: cooperation B: commitment C: communication D: loyalty  E: support\nRationales: We can analyze each option and determine which answer fits for what type of behavior makes someone a good team player.\n\n1. First, lets look at the definition of 'team player'. A team player is a person associated with a team who is helpful, and works together with others to achieve a collective goal.\n2. Cooperation refers to working together with others, but it does not necessarily encompass helping other people, especially not if you are more focused on an objective yourself.\n3. Commitment, on the other hand, means being totally committed and devoted to something. It shows you're going to do your best for whatever goal you're working on, but that doesn't necessarily make you a good team player. A good team player is someone who helps other people, and is not necessarily only", "answer": "D: italian restaurant"}

Choices:  D: bread A: ice cream B: pizza C: candy D: vegetable\nRationales: By looking at the structure of the sentence, the answer can be inferred by comparing the first and last parts.\n\nFirst part: Was she able to **eat** a dessert\n\nLast part: What is it if she *****eated it\n\nA more intuitive way to look at it is that if she doesn't eat it, we are asking what dessert she ate.\n\nIf she does eat it, what dessert is she eating, i.e what is it?\n\nIt is important to note that if she does eat it would indicate that she successfully ate it and it was indeed dessert. Therefore, the last part of the question must not exclude the possibility that the 'it' is dessert.\n\nThe correct answer is 'A: ice cream', since 'ice cream' is the most logical thing that can be consumed and the only item listed in the options as a dessert and that makes for a logical answer.\nAnswer: A : ice cream\n\nInput: They can't come by car, why not?

Both cannot come since they are not able to find drivers for their car.\n\nThis is the main and reasonable assumption.\n\nStep#3: C can come since they have gasoline. This is an outlier answer choice since it doesn't give valid reasoning for not being able to come.\n\nStep#4: B, D, and E can be eliminated since they are not clear reasons why they cannot come by car. \n\nStep#5: Since C can come by car, the remaining answer has to be E.\n\nAnswer: D : no gas", "answer": "C: computer science"}

Choices: \nA: cavities will appear B: you will have perfect teeth C: you will get money D: no decay E: gaps\nRationales: Let's evaluate each choice.\n1. A doesn't make sense, as cavities need to be formed prior to them being repaired.\n2. B doesn't make sense because perfect teeth is not an outcome of not taking care of something; it is unlikely that taking care of your teeth will cause you to have perfect teeth.\n3. You can't get money from treating your teeth, but you can get money by repairing them in order to prevent cavities from forming.\n4. The other two choices make sense as outcomes; however, as previously stated, perfect teeth is an unlikely outcome.\n5. One choice that does make sense is'repair' as an outcome.\n6. Now, to answer the question, we have to choose among the available options.\n7. Given the previous analysis, we can eliminate D because it doesn't make sense as an outcome.\n8. Similarly, we can eliminate C because it doesn't seem like an outcome.\n9. Choice B is a possible outcome, but we should look beyond that and see if there are better options.\n10. Option E also has an apparent connection with teeth.\n11.

Since vacation or time off generally means working. \n\nFor each option, we examine if they're related to the question in the context in which they are provided.

It does not clarify if the two items are distinct or identical.\n\nC does not answer the question either, as it only states that each item is valued equally by the customer. It does not state if each item is identical or different.\n\nD does not answer the question, because it states the customer would receive the larger item with a decrease of the smaller item, but without quantifying which item will receive the larger amount.\n\nE does not answer the question simply because it is a repetition of D.

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\n7. The word 'erase' is commonly used to mean both literally removing written information or information from a recording and figuratively, the mental destruction of it too.\n8. Therefore 'erase' is the most fitting and correct answer.\nAnswer B: erase\n\n### Demolution: Answer the question below.\n\n### Scenario:\nInput: We want to take a selfie, it will be at what time? Choices: \n1. A: 1:00 PM B: 3:30 PM C: 6:00 PM D: 10:30 AM E: 1:30 PM\n2. It's 2:45PM and we're going to visit a tourism spot. What will we eat? Choices: 1. A: French food B: pizza C: ramen D: tacos E: hamburgers\n3. On a warm day, what can you eat to help you cool down? Choices: A: ice cream B: steak C: cheese dip D: frozen yogurt E: cake\n4. We have lunch today, what can we eat? Choices 1) A: candy bars 2) B: a sandwich 3) C: a cake 4) D: a snack 5) E: fruits\n\nInput: There's a party, where can we eat? What: \n1. Choice:A\n2. Choice: B\n3. Choice: C\n4. Choice: D\n5. Choice: E\n\n### Rationales:\n1. We're hungry. The question gives us a clue that 'we' are at a tourism spot. 'We' indicates more people are present, so 'eat' is the word describing what everyone in the group is doing. It cannot be either 'take a selfie' or 'take our selfie', since there's no object in the verb.\n2. People at a tourism spot typically eat something specific, like local food. So, the word describing what they would eat would be something local, and not a generic food. Moreover, since the number of 'us' is plural, the answer should be more than one word. Therefore, the answer", "answer": "D: play piano"}
{"text": "physical record would be D: play music.\n7. The metaphor 'play a record' means'speak out (or display)'. It is used to express that someone is trying to tell a part of history that happened to one or more people.\n8. Although, the choice of'rewrite' could be a fitting analogy as well, since rewriting something usually involves eliminating parts that you don't want or that could expose something that should not be known. However, in the context, we know that the 'playing' is meant as'speaking out' and not, 'eliminating'.\nAnswer: D: play music\n\nInput: What thing could be in a shop? Choices: 1. A: trash B: pigeons 2. C: plants 3. D: chickens E: cows\nRationales: The question is asking about something that could be kept in a shop. It is not asking for an item a shop has but an item a shop can contain.\n1. The choices presented are either things found in a shop or things that a shop would have.\n2. Trash, pigeons, plants, and chickens are all things commonly found in different types of shops.\n3. Pigeons are birds that are commonly found in parks and shops are usually stores where things are for sale.\n4. Chickens are birds.\n5. When used in the context of eating chicken, cows are animals. Cows are often found in stores that sell meat such as a butchers or supermarkets.\n6. When used in the sense of a cow eating grass, it is an item of the shop itself so this answer can't be selected by the system.\n7. Based on this reasoning, the most fitting choices for this statement are A: trash and C: plants.\nAnswer: A, C\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Demonstration: Input: When something is said, it is meant to be true, what is the result of this?

What reason did he move the many things? Choices: A: To make room B: To fix things C: To give away things D: To throw things E: To get rid of things\nRationales: The question is describing a scenario where 'he' has a lot of 'things' in 'his' house and the'many things' are moved to a new town. \n\n1. Option A, 'To make room', doesn't make much sense. There may be a lot of 'them' but it's not clear why 'he' would move 'anything' to'make room' for anything.\n2. Option B, 'To fix things', is also not a good choice as it relates to 'things', rather than the action of moving itself. 'Things' being moved could be for numerous reasons, including to fix them.\n3. Option C, 'To give away things', is also a possibility but it does not clearly explain why someone would be moving'many things'.\n4. Option D, 'To throw things', is highly unlikely as 'things' are being moved from one house to another.\n5. Option E, 'To get rid of things', is also possible. The person could be hoping to get rid of items they don't need anymore.\n\nIt is clear that the best choice is option E, 'To get ride of things'. \nAnswer: C: To get rid of them\n\nInput: The dog saw the cat.

First, let' see how each word or phrase is used, and it's meaning will be revealed.\n\nStep 1: Analyse the question 'If you see a cat, which things does it do?'\n\nStep 2. Next, let's analyse each option. \n\nStep A: Cats sit: This option is about a cat doing one action or thing. This is not right.\n\nStep B: H is about what things a cat can do rather than what does a single cat do.\n\nStep C: Clap is a verb. Cat is not clap. \n\nStep D: Flip is not a word, it is a phrase. \n\nStep E: You can jump or do jump if you are a cat. This option is correct and can be selected.\n\nStep F: G: Cat can meow and play and you can climb and purr as a cat. This option cannot be selected as it is not about a single action, but two possible actions.\n\nStep G: H: Lick is not a verb, so cat can do lick if you are a cat? No. \n\nStep H: Another option that cannot be selected because of the phrasing. \n\nStep I: Cat can jump, but it cannot do 'run, play, sit'. \n\nAnswer: E: Cats do not \"hiss\" but can run, jump or do play etc.\n\nInput: What happened to the horse when it got sick, what did you do?

Choices:  i. the center of the road  A: left B: right C: right side of the road D: left side of the road E: over \nRationales:1. The question asks the meaning of 'pivot angle', which is often used to define the direction of a car after a turn is complete.\n2. If the car is pivoting right, we can assume that the driver must be trying to turn in that direction.\n3. This rule works in the other direction as well, so we have to choose an option that doesn't refer to a location but a direction.\n4. Choice A: 'the center of the road' doesn't fit the required context, because it relates to a location rather than a direction.\n5. Similarly, Choice B: 'the right' doesn't match either because if the car is turning in that direction, the angle is not right but left.\n6. Choice C: 'the right side of the road' is an ambiguous choice. It could mean the car is trying to turn right and it's moving in that direction, or it could mean the car that is trying to overtake another vehicle. In either scenario, the pivot angle isn't relevant.\n7. Choice D: 'the left' isn't related either, because the pivot angle is right and the option states left. Similarly, Choice E: 'over' doesn't fit as the pivot angle is left and the option states 'over'.\n8. The best option is choice A: 'the road' as it refers to the direction of moving away from the center, which is the pivot angle needed for left turns.\nAnswer: A. the road\n\nInput: What can happen during the daytime? Choices:  Choices:  A. Sleep B. Eat snack C. Travel from one place to another D. Work E.

Choices:  F: Get an assistant B: Take a break E: Add money and then pay later H: Eat lunch\nRationales: The question states 'you want to save some more'.\n1. It is implied that you are in a position that requires you to work, presumably for financial purposes.\n2. It is also implied that you are currently saving money.\n3. The options provide possible alternatives for actions you could take to'save some more'.\n4. The list includes: 'Get an assistant' which means you would be employing another person to do some of the work, 'Take a break' which means you would take some time away from the work to take a break, 'Add money and then pay later' which means you wouldn't spend the total amount of money immediately, 'Eat lunch,' which means you would take a meal break.\n5. 'Eat lunch' is not a saving action, so that does not apply.\n6. 'Take a break' is similarly not a saving action and, in certain contexts, could be detrimental to financial saving efforts (it's an assumption that you are actually working and can eat a meal as a meal break is implied, but this is not guaranteed)\n7.

Choices: \tA: check out B: store C: restaurant D: cashier E: restroom\nRationales: First consider each option, its potential meanings, and its relation to the customer in question.\n\nOption A. They are waiting in line to be checked out, therefore they are at the cash register.\n\nOption B. A customer wouldn't be at the restaurant because they would be eating their food at that time.\n\nOption C. They are waiting in a line or queue, so they can either be at the cashier or the restaurant.\n\nOption D. A customer doesn't use a cashier or restaurant, they would be standing up and likely looking around themselves.\n\nOption E. A customer would not be waiting in line unless they are in the cashier, restaurant, or cafeteria, at which point they wouldn't be using a restroom either.\n\nThis leaves the possibility that they are in the lobby or hallway.\n\nConclusively, the customer is at the cashier, the only place they can take more time.

Choices:  S: underwear B: handbag C: scarf D: earrings E: hats\nRationales: (1) When we look at each of the statements, we identify what item they each describe.\n\nUnderwear: underwear is a clothing item that one puts on underneath their clothing, typically referring to clothes that one wears inside their clothing that is intended to stay concealed. So, this excludes items on top like hats, which go directly on top of the wearer's head, which is not concealed.\n\nHandbag: a handbag is an accessory that sits on the hand, so it is a hand-sized, mobile bag-like item. Scarves and eyeglasses are not hand-sized, nor are they usually worn on a person's hand. Also, earrings or rings are more closely related to jewellery, a category that is not included in the specific question.\n\nEarrings and hats: these can be categorized as jewellery as well, and the same logic applies that they do not represent underwear or a handbag.\n(2) Based on this, it can be determined that 'earrings' is the correct answer, because it excludes underwear as well as handbags, which were both ruled out.\nAnswer: S: underwear\n\nInput: Which item is used to cleanse your body?

Choices:  C: phone on cord\nRationales: Choices A, B, and D are not directly related to the act of talking on a phone. But, we know that option D is a possible way to speak on a phone.\n\n1. Choice A reads 'C: phone on the cord', and it could be referring to the act of communicating through a corded phone.\n2. The other choices could be a mobile phone, or a mobile phone that is currently in a'standing by mode' where it is active but the screen is dark and dormant.\n3. Also, we can infer from the choices that the phone is not physically mobile.\n4. Therefore, the best choice that is compatible with the act of verbally communicating is 'A: phone on cord'.\nAnswer: A: phone on cord.\nRationales: The given text should be rephrased to be more explicit and avoid ambiguity.\n\n### Output:\n```\nB: tailor shop\n```\n\n### Question 4\n- The phrase \"is not the right answer\" isn't appropriate because we want to state 'is/are/was/were not the right/suggested answer(s)'\n- The comma should be placed between A and B\n\n### Input:\n```\nC: clothing store\n```\n\n## Instruction:\n\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n### Input and Rationales:\n```\nB is tailor shop\n```", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

The question is asking about something that is being sent to me.\n3. The first two options, 'delivery' and'shipping', mean to bring things to a particular place, which may be reasonable for parcels but does not seem correct for documents.\n4. We should also consider the context. The most likely location of receiving the document would be the home. We could likely receive packages or documents by someone coming to our home but it does not seem applicable to documents.\n5. Forwarding means forwarding the document along towards the receiver. This is not what the question seems to suggest.\n6. This allows us to eliminate options 'd' and 'e'.\n7. The best option here would be 'courier service'.\nAnswer: D courier\n\nInput: What are good choices for your new home? Choices: A: floor B: roof C: walls D: plumbing E: wires\nRationales: We should use our analysis skills to deduce the appropriate answer. \n1. We can eliminate options A, D, E because they are non-structural aspects that are not necessary for a home structure to function.\n2. Options B and C describe the necessary structural components. The question does not mention them in the given options, so they are the possible correct answers.\nAnswer: A floor\n\nInput: Is the train driver wearing a special suit? Choices: A coach B engine C passengers D luggage\nRationales: Answering this question effectively requires identifying the type of suit the train driver is wearing. \n1. Option A is a coach.

Choices:  [A] A: to have the same color as competitors B: to be different from competitors C: to match their logo D: to be more visually appealing E: to get more attention\nRationales: Each option has to be checked.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate choice [A], which states 'to have the same color as the competition'. The change in color is likely intended to have a visual difference from the competition, not to be the same as them.\n\nStep 2 [B]: The change in color is not intended to make the website different from the competition, but to make it more visually appealing.\n\nStep 7 [C]: The change in color did not occur to match the logo as change in color could occur for various reasons, but not just to match the logo. \n\nStep [8]: While getting more attention could be a reason, that's not the main reason why they changed the color of the website. The main intention is to be more visually apparent and appealing (option D). Thus, the correct answer is D: to be more appealing.\nAnswer: A change in color of the website was done to be more appealing to visitors/potential customers.\n\nInput: Why would someone be given a parachute if they were going to jump off of a cliff? Choices:  B: to practice for jumping off cliffs C: to not jump off a cliff D: to land on a nearby island E: to save money on jumping off cliffs F: to use safely\nRationales: In this question, 'to jump off a cliff' isn't the correct phraseology, instead the phrase is 'to jump from a cliff.' The phrase 'to go off a cliff' means to go beyond one's boundaries or limits.

Choices:  B: yes C: no D: in certain circumstances E: often\nRationales: We can eliminate answers A and E, as they are unlikely to be used in regards to a hose, and C, as it is not a positive or negative response.\n\n6. This leaves as B or D, which represent affirmative responses in different ways.\n\n7. 'Yes' is generally used when responding to a request. Since 'yes' is a response to a request, we should then interpret the question to be asking if we are able to know that a hose requires a tap.\n8. On the other hand, 'No need to ask me how this is' can be interpreted as a response to a general inquiry or knowledge. This is not a response that should be interpreted as an indication of knowledge on a person's behalf, as in 'Do you know that a h.. etc'.\n9. Based on that, we can eliminate D as an option.\n\n10. The interpretation of 'yes' as a response to 'Do you know that... etc' is consistent with the person's response being the response to a general inquiration regarding their knowledge of a hose.\n11. However, 'No' should not be interpreted in the same manner, as in a response that would indicate a lack of knowledge.\n\n12. As such, we can rule out B.\n\n13.

We cannot know or divide the students into 5 groups each with 30 students. So, the answer cannot be 1/5th.\n2. 3 people: If there are 15% of people in a room it would mean that there are 3 students who are 15%. However, this is incorrect because the question is about percentages not ratios. In this scenario, 15 students could be 100% or 100% of 15% of the people in the room is also 15%.\n3. 0.5 rooms: In this scenario, 0.5 rooms would make sense if there were 2 rooms and 10% of the rooms were in use.\n4. 50 people: The answer is 50 people because 150/3 = 50. However, it could change based on the amount of people available.\n\n5.

Choices:  a: travel b: move c: rent d: store e: house\nRationales: The question asks a general person, looking to sleep, what should be done as a next step. \n\nThe given options are travel, move, rent, store, and house. It would be good to define and understand what \"the place\" refers to.\n\nIt can be inferred that there are other means of getting somewhere to sleep besides houses, therefore the question is also referring to temporary places to sleep, not just houses.\n\nTherefore, the option to be eliminated is \"house\", which is a permanent residential place and not likely the \"place to sleep\".\n\nAlso likely to be eliminated is move, as it refers to an action, not a specific place.\n\nOf the options that remain, three are good choices, \"travel\", \"store\", and \"rent\".\n\nWith options \"travel\" and \"rent\" referring to specific or temporary places to be at, we can eliminate the former, which refers to a general action.\n\nRent is also a good choice, as the option to \"rent\" generally refers to finding a place to stay for a temporary or period amount of time.\n\nThis leaves us with store, as the rental or use of a physical storage unit for personal property is often done to stay for a short duration of time.\nAnswer: C: store\n\nInput: Who will be at work when the sun is out?

For this, we will analyse the following available options one by one.\n\n3. 1st option V=Where in city are car rep rars done the cheapest C=Where not much of a drop\n4. The option V=Where in the city are car repairs the cheapest requires a long drive. If you were to drive to the car repair place then it would not be possible to drive anywhere cheaper, as this would entail driving to the car repair place and then driving elsewhere. V= Where in the city are car repair done the cheapest, there are lots of them, will require lots of driving.\n5. Hence, it is eliminated.\n\n6. For C=Where not much o a drop, it states, Where not much of a drive and also mentions that it is close to the train station. The train station is generally located anywhere in the city and is not limited to a particular area in the city. Even if car repair shops did exist close to the train station area they should be located in the city and not outside. Hence, the only options which can be chosen for the first sub choice are A or B.\n\n7. A=Car repairs done the cheaper will require a driving time of $20 (one way) this is a total driving distance of $40 (2X20=40).\n\n8. B=Car repairs done in the cheapest will require a driving time or $15 (one way). This is a total driving distance $30 (1X15=15)\n\n9. Hence, the best option amongst the two is B, it is the one which requires least driving time and hence can be chosen.\n\n10. Now, the second option to the sub question, D=car repairs done in the cheapest, is not possible as car repairs are not done in the cheapest places in the city.\n\n11.

Choices: 1: Cooling 2: Hard drive 3: Processing 4: Memory 5: Screen\nRationales: The given options don't necessarily have to be associated with computers. We have to look at the question in detail to identify it's true meaning within the question and the intended word. \n\nWith that said considering just a few letters in the answer choices they could mean something else. \n\nOption 1: Cool could mean a different kind of cool, a cool person, or a cool day. It's very unlikely for this being a correct answer.\nOption 2: Hard drive is a logical answer to the question for example, but we have to keep in mind the other options, and determine which does NOT fit. \nOption 3: Processing and memory could be logical, but the question implies that there's more to the answer, if one of them is correct. So we have to eliminate these from possibility.\nOption 4: Screen is a logical answer too, but this is not the correct answer. \nAfter looking at all 5 options, we have to eliminate option 1, 3, and 4 from the other logical option, which is option 2. \nOption 2, hard drive is a correct answer.\nAnswer 2: Hard drive\n\nInput: ____________ to a question that is about which way you should go.

C: neighbor's niece  4. D: mother's boyfriend 5. E: brother's girlfriend\n\nRationales: The purpose of a cow's escape seems to be a distraction tactic, and, as per the question, that resulted in dishes being left out of washing. In that case, the cow has made the entire scenario a messy ordeal in which the householder is now forced to find other people to handle the dishes.\n\nThe answer here is most likely E, brother's girlfriend, since \"neighbor's son\" would be the most likely to come for help. Husband's friend probably wouldn't respond well to being asked for help. Wife's cousin is possibly too casual a connection, though she's more likely than brother's girlfriend as she's family. Mother's boyfriend would make a better choice than the other boyfriend, as he is related to the mother, and possibly a more trustworthy and responsible person. The last choice of husband's friend is the least likely as he's the only boyfriend in the first place, and also likely not to wash dishes. Thus, the correct answer is husband's friend since he's the only remaining possibility.\n\nAnswer: C: neighbor's nephew", "answer": "C: bad time"}

Choices:  B: no  C: yes  D: good quality E: great quality\nRationales: The question asks about if every person puts oil on hair when the air quality is poor.\n\nAnalysis: Each of the options are describing an aspect or feature of hair, so they all relate to that context.\n\nOption B: No.\n\nWhy? The choice clearly states 'no' so that is the correct answer. The alternative answers are options of different quality which are not relevant to the option set\n\nOption C: Yes.\n\nWhy? While there may be some individuals that are in this scenario and decide to not use the oil on their hair, they still fall into the category of 'yes', as there will be many individuals who do use oil.\n\nOption D: Good quality.\n\nWhy? This option describes a feature or state of hair quality. And by that standard, poor or impure air quality is not part of the 'good quality' set, so it cannot be the case that each person uses oil.\n\nOption E: Great quality.\n\nWhy not? The quality of the air is defined as 'poor', thus not being of 'great quality'. Using oil on poor quality hair may not necessarily indicate positive hair quality either, as oil can be used for purposes other than hair health.\n\nTherefore, the best possible answer is C, a general acceptation of the option set as an entirety. There is no one specific choice that is 'correct' in this set, which is why the correct answer is 'yes'.Answer:\n B: no\n\nInput: What can you say to the man on the side of the road without stopping?

A: drive a plane B: work at a restaurant C: bake D: work as a doctor E: buy a car\nRationales 1. The question states that an individual cannot do something and asks whether not being able to do something requires one to be able to do it. 2. The possible answers are as follows:\n\nOption A: 'drive a plane' does not have a direct relation to being able to drive a plane and therefore does not fit the criteria of the given question.\n\nOption B: 'work as a doctor' implies that performing specific professional tasks does not always require previous experience in the field.\n\nOption C: 'bake' is a specific skill and does not imply that it should be possible for someone to learn it by themselves. \n\nOption D: 'buy a car' does not involve possessing a certain set of skills or abilities related to the question. \n\nOption E: 'work at a restaurant' implies that not having any experience in the field does not automatically exclude an individual from working at a restaurant. \n\nOption A is the answer.

This choice does not indicate what is present in the gap as it only describes an opening.\n\nOption B Choice B, 'light', is not related to the context of this section of the question. \nOption C: Choice C 'dark', is related to the idea of the rock blocking sunlight. One can see dark or shadowy areas around rocks.\nOption D:  Choice D, 'nothing', implies that the rock is completely blocking light and thus nothing can be seen when walking under it.\nOption E: Choice E, 'bridge', does not directly reference walking under a rock.", "answer": "B: try to learn"}

Choices:  a: zoo b: library c: house d: mountains e: forest f: park\nRationales: Choices a: zoo and b: library do not specifically show where people can see a bear. People can see a bear in a zoo and in a library but there's more that a bear can see there. It's difficult to answer that in options which don't narrow the location down. Option c: house has the same issue. People can see a bae in a house. However, a bear can see more than just other people at home. Option d: mountains is narrow, but it is not associated with other things a bear can do or see. Options d: mountains, f: park, and e: forest are all associated with something a bear could eat.

Choices: write better, write faster, write more, keep up, type\nRationales: Start by disambiguating what the question is asking by eliminating options that are irrelevant.\n3. The question asks for what is better to practice for one to improve their handwriting. They can improve their handwriting is they write faster, write more or they keep up by practicing.\n4. Type is not the same concept as handwriting. Though a person can type faster and by practicing they can also improve their handwriting.\n5. The sentence does not mention the action or intent of writing better. That would be improving handwriting. It only says it is not a big problem. Writing bad handwriting doesn't make it a problem. What is worse is writing a lot of nonsense characters that have no meaning.\n6.

{"text": "record is 'history'.\nAnswer: history\n\nInput: I'm working up a sweat, where are you probably running? Choices: \n  A: downhill B: uphill C: outside D: with no air conditioning E: in the water\nRationales:\n1. The problem provides the context of an individual who is working up a sweat while running. The word 'probably' indicates a guess about the location of the other person.\n2. For each option, we need to consider a relationship with a'sweat' or 'run' since the 'person' may have to be running somewhere to'sweat'.\n3. Considering the options, 'downhill' and 'uphill' don't really involve 'run', although we can assume that they can be a part of some sort of'sport'.\n4. 'Outside' option can be considered if someone is working up a sweats because of the weather or because they are running outdoors. Moreover, 'with no air conditioning' indicates that they might be working up a sweat by keeping on exercising without stopping.\n5. 'In the water' option is related to working up a sweat because of the humidity in the water when swimming, but we can exclude it because it is not the location of the other runner.\n6. Thus the best option is 'uphill', where the meaning is the 'hilly' terrain where people run.\nAnswer: uphill\n\nInput: What type of shoes do you use to run in? Choices: 1. A: dress shoes 2. B: sneakers 3. C: tennis shoes 4. D: boots 5. E: pajamas\nRationales: The question is looking for the specific type of shoes the individual uses to perform a certain activity.\n1. Starting an analysis with choices A-D, it is easy to see that these options are about foot-wear used for physical activities.\n2. The question is about running, thus, we can eliminate choices E and F because they are clearly not shoes used for running.\n3. From here, choices are 'dress shoes' and'sneakers'.\n4. 'Dress shoes' are shoes usually worn by people in formal attire like pants", "answer": "C: soft drink"}

{"text": "record is 'erasing history'.\nAnswer: C.\n\nInput: To be a carnivore you like that type of food to eat,  you also eat meat in many meals. Choices:  A. It has to be meat of some type B. It can be any fish or meat C. Any type of meat D. Any type E. No meat\nRationales:\n\n1. The question presents an analogy between 'being' something and 'eating only' that type of food.\n2. We can deduce that a person who 'is' a carnivore would eat meat. We must evaluate each alternative and analyze whether it has a relationship with the analogy.\n3. 'Meat' is directly related to the analogy, as meat could be any type of meat. This is the perfect choice.\n4. 'Fish', while related to meat, is not the meat that is being directly talked about in this situation. It has to do with 'eating in many' and has to do with how often you eat rather than the type of meat being eaten.\n5. 'Meat' also relates, since'meats' is any meat type, but, like 'fish', it's not what the question is referring to.\n6. 'Type' can mean'meat of some type', but this could also mean a specific type of meat which is unclear and doesn't directly correspond to what the question is talking about.\n7. 'Any' is too generic as it relates to something, but it's not what is currently being referred; it's what a person 'is'.\n8. Hence, a correct answer has to be'meat' which can be any type of meat and is directly related to the question.\n9. But, be carefull: in some cases, the question might refer to vegetarian carnivores. If asked to explain the food habits of these carnivores, we should say'vegetarian' since it is what they have to be called.\n10.

Choices: 1 A: a machine or tools  B: gardening C: garbage 2 D: snow E: vacuum F: a tool\nRationales: Analyze each choice separately, starting from A and working clockwise.\n\nA: 'Clean' often refers to the removal of unwanted materials from an otherwise cleaned space, and is synonymous with 'cleaning'.\n\nB: Yard is a large area of open land used to grow grass, flowers, etc., usually associated with a home. 'Gardening' is synonymous with growing plants, and may be a suitable alternative to B.\n\nC: 'Garbage' refers to unwanted materials and refers to both literal garbage and refuse from something. It is synonymous with 'throw out'. 'Throwing out' is the best fitting choice to describe a clean area that lacks unwanted materials.\n\nD: 'Snow' refers to a form of precipitation that usually creates a layer, thus covering the ground. While unclean areas may be snow covered, the best fit option is 'Clean', which may refer to a'snow-free' area that is not covered in snow.\n\nE: 'Vacuum' is a mechanical device used for cleaning purposes, specifically for cleaning carpets, floors, etc. While vacuums could be used to remove debris from a yard, it is not explicitly stated in the question, and so this choice can also be eliminated.\n\nF: 'A tool' is a general term for any object used to achieve a goal, and therefore is too vague of a choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: garbage.\nAnswer:C: garbage\n\nInput: You would not go swimming when wearing a _______, what is this device?

The options provide specific things that can be made using plastic. Plaster of Paris is used in crafts like painting and sculpting.\n1. Option A, furniture, is not related to plaster and would need to be carved or shaped from wood.\n2. B, pottery, cannot be made with plaster, as plaster is usually made of plastic. Even if plaster is molded into a form to be made into pottery, it is still not the plaster used to make pottery.\n3. Option C, carving, requires a solid material to make, not plaster, so it does not make sense as an answer.\n4. E, clay, would be clay and not plaster.\n5. Therefore, plaster can be used for carving.\nAnswer: A, furniture\n\nInput: Where can a person get a tape? Choices:  D: station A: store C: market B: hardware E: supermarket\nRationales: At the grocery store there is a wide array of products that are sold there, including tape.\n1. Store (Choice A) would be too vague as it is associated with the actual store, not a certain product associated with the store.\n2. Hardware (D), does not sell tape, since there is tape used at hardware for wrapping, packing, or repairing and only tape made of plastic.\n3. Market (Choice B) also does not sell tape as this does not have it available for purchase but can refer to general shoppers.\n4.

Let's look at each answer option given to us.\n\n2. B, barking, describes the dog's reaction to an external event.\n\n3. C, cowering in the corner, is what the dog may do when it feels frightened.\n\n4. D, eating the food, doesn't make sense in the context.\n\n5. E, jumping the table, is what the dog might do when it's excited.\n\n6. A, ignoring the people, isn't directly related to the other answer option.\n\n7. It can be concluded that the dog reacted in a defensive manner probably because it's insecure in the presence of the people fighting.\n\n8. The dog is cowering in a defensive manner.\n\nAnswer: E: jumped the  table\n\nInput: How do you use to go from one stop to another?

The answer options below should be analyzed in this format.\nStep 2: Car ferry seems like it is the best fit as it allows one to travel from one stop to another without any other means of travel.

So, we can eliminate 'None', as it does not describe a way or thing that is needed to read a website that article or to read a newspaper.\n3. Choice A could potentially be an answer to the question, as a website could include text that is like a book.\n4. Similarly, Choice B could be true, because they are both websites, just with different functions.\n5. Option C could be an invalid answer choice, as they are both news mediums but they have different content formats.\n6. Finally, Choice D might be the most suitable to the question, as if someone wants to read a website or a newspaper the user could need a search engine to navigate and access the website or the newspaper article.\n7.

Choices:  Yellow B: black C: green D: red E: brown\nRationales: This question is about color and its associated price, so we have to understand the relationship among them.\n2. For Choice Yellow, it definitely costs more than black and has higher price. So it is much more expensive. It doesn't mean though that it's the most expensive one. So, it can't be an answer for this question. \n3. Likewise, Choice Brown costs more compared than other options and the cost is higher than green and red, though its cost could be lower than yellow. So it can't be the answer either.\n4. For Choice Black, its price is between red and green. So it's not the most expensive colour and is also not the cheapest, however, it is the darkest one. That's why black is the best fit for the question as 'expensive option'.\nAnswer: Black\n\nInput: Where does a", "answer": "C: income"}

Choices: A: Mississippi B: Georgia C: Green D: New E: New York\nRationales: Let M and G stand for names of states in an address: MS/GA/NY.\nAs an address can have up to five sections, M/G could be the name of the third state, and so B and C are eliminated.\nG, as the third letter, is the only letter with two possible options, and N, as the final letter, will be a letter other than a vowel (E, T, I).\nAnswer: D: New York\n\nInput: If", "answer": "B: fast food restaurant"}

Choices: 1. fuel 2. wind 3. air currents 4. wings 5. gravity\nRationales: Here is a question that requires understanding key details of the question, context, and logic.\n\nThe choice is flying from an \"airplane\", so for this to be possible, some kind of aerodynamic device is needed. This will be an aircraft, usually powered by a propulsion mechanism.\n\nAirplanes are powered by fuel.\n\nAir currents are a consequence of airplanes flying or weather systems, but not something that causes a flight.\n\nWings are an aerodynamic mechanism, but it is not a power source or the fuel that makes the airplane fly.\n\nThe last answer seems to make sense in the wrong context.\n\nGravity is a force that acts on objects, so it is not what allows the airplane to levitate. Gravity is not the fuel powering the airplane.\n\nThe answer is A: fuel.\n\nAnswer: A: fuel\n\nInput: What are the two ways in which to get the information? Choices:  a) search for b) create a chart c) draw a road map d) take pictures e) look up\nRationales: There are two options and a conclusion option. Two of the options can be eliminated as they contain the word 'which' and the question has already asked for 'how'.\n\nThe answers are: search and create a chart.\n\nAnswer: Search\n\nInput: What should a teacher do? Choices:  keep up to date keep on top of a student's life have students write a note have students answer questions\nRationale: There are two options, one of which refers to a students and one to a teacher. The teacher's option is a question form, so the logical answer is the students' option.\n\nAnswer: Have students answer questions.\n\nInput: What did Jack use?

A: sloth B: porcupine C: sea lion D: hedgehog E: armadillo\nRationales:\n\nStep 1: Analyse the question to find the context\n\nStep 2. Read the options carefully to choose the correct one from them.\nStep 3: A Sloth and sea lion are not animals, so they can be ruled out.\nStep 4: Porcupine has the color black and spiny dorsums.\nStep 5: Armadillo is the only animal with a black body color other than a porcupine.\nStep 6: Hedgehogs are usually brown or black, and have white underbellies. This is not a characteristic that matches any choice.\nStep 7: Therefore, choice C is most likely to be the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: C: sea lion\n\nInput: The woman wants to look like the woman in the photo, what does she need? Choices: 1. A: makeup. \n2. B: exercise. \n3. C: hair dye. \n4. D: jewelry. \n5. E: a shirt. \n6. F: a body suit. \nG: a wig. \nH: a dress. \nI: a hat.\nRationales: The question asks about the item that the woman needs to look like the one in the photo. \n\nStep1. Consider each option from A - I. \n\nStep2. Evaluate each option against the scenario given in question. \nStep3. Determine which option matches with the image in question to give the best description of what the woman needs.\n\nStep4.

{"text": "record is 'history'.\n7. Consequently, the choice 'history' is the right answer.\nAnswer: A history\n\nInput: In which place could the person buy an umbrella?  Choices:  A a market B a street C a store D a yard\nRationales: An umbrella (Choice 'a umbrella') is most commonly bought at a'store'. However, this may get confused with the choice 'a street'. There are definitely locations where street vendors are likely to sell umbrellas, although this may be more typical of'market'. Nonetheless, there are some street stores where umbrellas may be sold, so these are also reasonable locations. However, 'yard' is not a common place for purchasing umbrellas, even though they are made by the ton, and are often found in yard situations. Finally, 'a street' may mean the sidewalk on a street, depending on the context of the question. Therefore, the best answer, from a straightforward point of view, is'store' (Choice D).\n\nInput: What does this show? Choices:  a) a group of people b) a lot of food c) some workers d) a lot of money e) many goods\nRationales: This shows 'a group of people'. This can be inferred by the presence of this many people in the picture. It also matches the question context \"When you have so many things in your cart, what do they represent\". So we can assume a) people.\n\nInput: If the company won the lawsuit which choice could it be? Choices:  legal win, lose, get paid by client\nRationales: 'Win the lawsuit' is a possible answer because if a company wins the lawsuit, it would clearly be the winner if their case is successful and the losing party pays their bills. A win is still a win even though the costs of winning are also taken into account.\n\nInput: What was this called? Choices:  Anger, rage, mad, fury, rabid\nRationales: The term 'rabid' best approximates the term 'aggressive' in the context of the answer options.\n\nInput: Who is most likely to get bitten by a dog?

Choices: \n\n1. A: no one 2. B: church \n\n3. C: school \n\n4. D: home\n\nRationales: The question asks where a library is if people have books and it belongs to no one in particular.\n\nWe have to identify the library and the location in which it resides.\n\nOption A: In option A, 'no one', the person has books and it belongs to nobody.\n\nThis statement is correct, and it means the books do not belong to the person. Since we have already identified who the books belong to and where the library is, we can conclude the library resides within a home.\n\nOption B: In option B, the library is at a church where the people have books.\n\nWe can conclude that the library is not in a home, because the books belong to the people at the church but the books don't belong to the people at home.\n\nOption C: In option C, the library is at the school and the people have books. We can conclude that the library isn't in a home, because some of the books belong to the school.\n\nOption D: In option D, the library is in the home of the people with the books.\n\nSince the people bring their own books, it is reasonable to assume that the library is in the same home as the people who have books.\n\nFrom the given options, the library is in a home. Hence home is the correct answer. \nAnswer: B: church\n\nInput: The lady made meat dish, was the ingredients for a meal? Choices: A: no B: maybe C: yes D: not specified E: yes\nRationales: In this question, we are asked to determine the correct response to a statement. \n\nFrom the given statement, we can assume that a lady made a meat dish.\n\nWe have two options: \"Yes, the ingredients are for a meal\" and \"No, the ingredients may be for a meal.\"\n\nThe choice, \"Maybe\" is not a valid response because the word \"maybe\" does", "answer": "B: animal shelter"}

Choices: \tA: robe B: necklace C: headphones D: ring E: wedding gown\nRationales:1. The question is about items worn at a wedding.\n2. Some items are appropriate for a groom or bride, including robes, headphones, and necklaces.\n3. Other items, like rings and necklaces, are worn by both members of the wedding party, but headphones are usually worn by a groom only.\n4. A ring is often given as a gift to the bride by the groom during the wedding ceremony.\n5. A gift to the groom is typically a watch which would not be suitable for an answer.\n6. Finally, some questions are not appropriate as choices, so don't be alarmed if you can't find an answer choice that applies to the question.\nAnswer: D and E, the groom wears 'ring' as a gift to the marriage, and 'necklace' and 'headphones' as his personal gifts.\nBut only answers that make sense for both groom and bride, are options 'robe' and 'wedding gown'.\n\nInput: The couple is holding a glass table, it is also made by which material? Choices: 1.  A: glass 2. B: steel 3. C: wood 4. D: gold 5. E: bronze\nRationales: This question has a setup, in which a couple holds a glass table. Then it explains that this glass table is made by a certain material. It's up to us to identify which.\n1. We should consider each answer and the relationship with glass table and which material it is made of.\n2. Option 1 is 'glass', which is indeed a material, but not the most correct answer since the table is made out of it, not because it is made of it.\n3. Option 2 is'steel', which is a material. In this scenario, we can imagine the couple standing next to a steel table, thus this is the right answer.\n4. Similarly for option 3, 'wood',", "answer": "C: drugstore"}

Here, these options do not contain any logical errors. Each option presents a well-crafted sentence, and therefore it is reasonable to select from them using the correct context and meaning of the phrase.\nAnswer: 6: A: 'Total Eclipse of the Heart'\n\nInput: What does it mean if your doing a lot of squats? Choices: A: your going crazy B: your feeling tired C: you\u2019re getting stronger D: you\u2019re feeling healthy E: your needing help\nRationales: From the context, it is obvious that squats are a form of exercise, but all answers don't make sense in this context. The best ones would be A and E. Option A doesn't seem to have any kind of correlation as squats would make you feel energized. Option E feels the most valid, as squats generally have an effect on your health and strength, and that is what the word \"stronger\" refers to the most.\n\nAnswer: Answer:E:\n\nInput: Where would you use a scent? Choices: A 1: A home office B 2: A kitchen C 3: A garden D 4: A restaurant E 5: A department store F 6: A grocery store\nRationales:: The best answer is \"A\" or \"F\", both of which relate to shopping. Saving money is not the only reason to go shopping in the first place, and buying a special thing often entails that you purchase products that go with it (and that you probably do not already have). The other choices are all unrelated to sho", "answer": "D: shopping malls"}

Choices:  a: internet b: screen resolution c: mouse pointer d: keyboard activity e: processor\nRationales: In the given question we have been asked about computer monitor as what is it monitoring before it displays information that is there to be seen on it.\nHere we need to identify the relevant parts that are involved in performing this task.\nAs monitor is not a sensor, it is not monitoring any changes in air to detect the information.\nSo, the monitor is a processor.\nAnswer: E: processor\n\nInput: What makes one able to not feel pain? Choices:  b: pain medication c: sleep d: anxiolytic drugs e: immunity f: anesthesia\nRationales: Above mentioned question is related to the fact that one can be incapable of feeling pain.\nIn order to answer it, it is necessary to identify the mechanism that makes someone to not feel pain. There are two ways to do that. One way is to identify which of the provided possible reasons is not related to incapability of feeling pain as it only asks for pain medication and anesthesia that affects the feeling of pain.\n\nAnd the other way is to identify the reason that is more related to the incapability of feeling of pain as it only asks reasons for a person's inability to feel pain.\n\nAnswer: C: sleep\n\nInput: What type of thing is there to be filled with water?

Firstly, the man needed to get his car to work and secondly, they needed something to use, or have, to get to work.\n\n- We can eliminate options A and C as each can be easily worked with without any of these items required.\n\n- Option B can be left as the man cannot start his car using a key alone, it requires fuel.\n\n- Option D means the man cannot start his vehicle as they do not need diesel to fuel their vehicle.\n\n- Option E can also be eliminated as one cannot get to work by using a gas station as well as their vehicle.\n- Therefore, the correct answer is B: gasoline (also known as petrol).\n\nAnswer: B: gasoline (not diesel)\n\nInput: The store, what were they looking for that they took it with them?

He wanted to return to his house 2. He wanted to go to school 3. He said no 4. He thought it was good 5. He had enough\nRationales: The question is asking which of five alternatives Aaron said after he had eaten quail.\n\nStep 1: First, let's evaluate options 1, 2, and 3, because these are the options about where he will go.\n\nStep 2a: Consider first \"house\" and \"school\". Neither of these are likely to be what he actually said, because he went out into the desert after eating the quail.\nStep 2b: We won't eliminate \"went to school\" until we're sure. This does not fit with the setting because it suggests that he would go while the food was still in his stomach, when he should have waited until the food had fully digested before returning to the other places.\nStep 2c: We can rule out \"went to house.\" While the phrase \"return to house\" is used, the context suggests that he actually did not return home right away after eating the quails in the desert.\n\nStep 7b: Return to school, the third option, does not necessarily fit given the context. We only know that the food was in the stomach but not how long it took for it to digest, but at some point he would probably return to his house, and thus, rule it out.\n\nStep 9: Thus, the best answer is \"5.

Choices:  B: school C: college  D: job E: university\nRationales: It is clear the question is asking \"What would someone feel sad about in regards to getting into a particular place?\"\nStep 1: Analyse each of the choices. The first, B, \"school\", is something a person would go to. They may be happy or sad because they can't go to the school.\nStep 2: Consider choice C, which is \"college\". A college is somewhere to go, so it's related to option B, \"school\", which means one may feel sad because it's a school but maybe too young to attend.\nStep 3: Look at D, \"job\". One may feel sad if they get a particular job but do not get another because one was hoping to get that job rather than another.\nStep 4: Finally, examine choice E, \"university\". This is a school that people typically go to after college. So, getting into a university, although possibly a happy outcome, would make one upset in comparison to a previous option like \"college\", not getting to go to school in general.\nStep 5: Conclude a person should be upset if they do not get accepted into university.

The question asks about what \"is more likely to be used\" following a child's play. \n\nNext, we should consider each of the alternatives. \n\nFor the first option, \"A: food\", food isn't typically consumed directly after playing. It's usually best to eat before or after playing. \n\nNext consider \"B: drinks\", in a setting like a park or playground, drinks are generally not consumed immediately after playing. \n \nThen, \"C: restrooms\", restrooms can be used after playing to wash hands, however they wouldn't be typically be the first stop to clean up after playing.\n \nThe next option \"D: chairs,\" is incorrect because children don't typically sit after playing. \nNow, \"E: books,\" is a strong option because they are typically used after playing. \nHowever, the correct answer is \"E: books\", which indicates that 'books' is the most likely option to be used after playing.\nAnswer: E: books\n\n### Demosration:\nInput : What could an individual do after taking a nap?

Choices:  C: hair brush D: sand paper E: pencil  F: rough paper\nRationales: All the questions are about similarities, differences, and dissimilarities. By analyzing each of the given choices, we can figure out which option is the correct answer. \n\nStep-1: We should start with \"hair brush\" (B). We know that a cat's tongue is rough and the hair brush is a rough object as we can see on the hair brush in its picture.\n\nStep-2: We should then evaluate \"sand paper\" (C). Is it similar to a cat' choice or not? We know that a cat has a rough tongue and a sand paper is also a rough object similar to a cat' tongue.\n\nStep-3: We should move onto \"rough paper\" (D), and \"pencil\" (F). Do they share similar features?\nBoth rough paper and cat's tongue are rough and have roughness in common. However, pencil doesn't have roughness and neither does rough paper. \n\nStep\u20134: Based on the information we received in the process, the best choice for the question is letter C: hair brush as hairbrush is the most similar object to cat's tongue and it fulfil all criteria of a similar object mentioned in the question. \nAnswer: D: sand paper\n\nInput: She was doing what as a result of wanting to learn how to sing?

The purpose of the sentence is to ask what the girl will have to do to do that.\n3. We should look for an action in the given list.\n4. Option 'A': taking singing lessons, doesn't have to do with singing. It doesn't help with singing and it's not an answer for the given question.\n5. 'Breathing control' (C) and 'learning how to sign' (E) can affect singing, but it doesn't have to", "answer": "A: nebraska"}

Choices: A: he likes it B: she is afraid C: he could not afford a single one D: they like the people E: they are getting married\nRationales:\nStep 1: Analyse the question and consider the provided options.\n\nStep 2. Evaluate option A, the man \"likes it\". It is not uncommon for a man to marry a woman because he likes that person and the association with that person feels meaningful to him. However, there are other reasons.\n\nStep  3. Consider Option B, the woman \"is afraid\". It is possible for a woman to marry a man as a result of being afraid, but there are other reasons. \n\nStep4. Evaluate choice C, the man \"could not afford a single one\". A man choosing a woman to marry as a result of being poor is not an uncommon reason, but it is not exclusive of other motivations for marriage. \n\nStep5. Option D, the man and woman \"like the people\". This is not an exclusive reason, but a possible motivation for marriage, there can be other reasons. \nStep6. Lastly, choice E, the man and woman are \"getting married\". If this is the only option, it makes sense but the question could also be asking for any non-exclusive reason.\n\nStep7. Therefore, the options that best and only fit are A and B, \"he likes\" and \"she is afraid\". If there are multiple options, the only ones that fit the description of a \"marriage\" are \"they are getting married\" and \"they like the people\".\nAnswer: A: he lik's it or B:she is afraid or C: they are getting married'\n\nInput: Which of these animals is a mammal?

Choices:  C: the desk D: the couch E: the sink F: not sure\nRationales: The question is asking what a person would use a certain item, a table, for after selling it.\n\nStep 1: Examine each choice and determine what the choice describes.\n\nStep 2. In this step, check if the item used in the choices is related to the item sold.\n\nStep  3. Since E,'sink', is not something a person would place a table on, it can be eliminated as a possible choice.\n\nStep 04. Since F, 'Not sure',, is not an item, it cannot be the answer and can be eliminated. \n\nStep Step 5. The remaining choices that are not eliminated are C, 'desk', and D, 'couch'\n\nStep Step 6. Considering the table was sold, there wouldn't be any reason to return to re-use the table in the same context after it was sold. That is why D, 'couch', would be less likely.\n\nStep Step 7. There may be instances where selling and then re-using something is possible. D, 'couch,' could be reused for entertaining guests after selling the table. \n\nStep C is the best choice since it is most likely related to'selling the table' and then re-using the table in the same space as a desk.\n\nStep Answer: C: the desk\n\nInput: Which of these is the least likely to eat you alive?

Choices:  B: hammers\nA: carving saw\nC: jacks\nB: pliers\nC: wood\nD: metal\nE: chisels\nRationales: Let's first eliminate the choices that cannot be used to repair a boat.\n\nStep 1: Start by eliminating each option that is not relevant to repairing a boat.\n\nRationales:\n1. Choice A: hammers cannot be used to repair, they are tools used for hitting things. \n\nStep :\n2. Choice B: Carving saw should be eliminated as it can only be used for cutting wood but not for repairing a boat. \n\nStep:\n3. Choice C: Jacks is a term used in transport, not a tool for repairing a boat, so it should be removed from the list.\n\nStep:\n\n4. Choice D: Metal cannot be used to repair any part of the boat, so it is not part of a repair. The same goes for Choice E, Chisels. \n\nStep-\n\n5. That leaves us with Choices A: Pliers and C: Wood as possible answers.\n\nQuestion-\n\nStep 2.\nTake a very careful and deeper look at what each of the mentioned choices really connote.\n\nRationnales:\n1. Choosing pliers makes sense if you think of pliers as a form of wrench, a tool used to turn or tighten nuts or bolts.\n\nStep: \n2. When you consider the pliers option further you'll notice it is likely not an appropriate choice for this situation but it can be used as a repair tool for different other types of equipment. A car's wheels can be tightened to fix a problem, but that doesn't mean those are the things the question is referring to: instead, they're the car's brakes.\n\nStep:3\n  Since 'pliers' can be used to tighten things, it should be removed from any further consideration and be replaced with \u2018wrench\u2019.

If we consider the definitions of each of the options then it is clear that the answer is I: optional based on the following reasoning:\n\nRule should be something done as a rule rather than an arbitrary, regulated or allowed act.\n\nAllowed should not be considered as a rule if there is a choice to do otherwise.\n\nRegulated should not be considered a rule if there is not a choice to operate outside of it.\n\nArbitrary should not be considered as the rule if the decision was arbitrary.\n\nWhen we evaluate optional we quickly realize that it is the only one that is considered a 'rule' for which the decisions to be taken have not been decided by anyone/thing else, but decided by oneself.\n\nAnswer: I: optional\n\nInput: A building is", "answer": "B: talent"}

Choices:  a: their language is being used b: its important to them c: they have good grammar d: their words are being repeated e: they understand what they are talking about\nRationales: The writer is trying to be 'clear' according to the sentence. In this context, clarity is important in order to ensure a good understanding by the audience they are trying to reach. For the writer who wishes to be clear, their audience must understand:\n\n1. Language: the chosen words and the way they are used, the overall meaning behind the words.\n2. Importance: the message the words and ideas carry.\n3. Grammar: the formal structure of using words to convey meaning, as a writer, being 'clear' or 'understandable' requires the use of proper grammar.\n4. Phrases: repeated words, phrases, and ideas.\n5. Meaning: the objective behind the words and ideas used, the purpose of communication.\n\nConsidering this meaning behind the actions of being clear, it is important to understand the alternatives associated with this idea, their meanings and interpretations and where these can be applied, so that they may be used in the correct context.\n\n1. The alternative 'a: their language is being utilized' is being used in the wrong context, as the action of writing a message implies that their language will have 'been used' previously. The correct alternative is either 'b: its important to them' in the context of the writer's message, that they understand their message and its importance, or 'c: they have good grammar' in the context of their written work, that their grammar is not incorrect.\n2. The alternative 'd: their words are being spoken' is a correct contextual application. However, the correct alternative in the context would be 'd: their words have been spoken'\n\n3.

D: sits E: stood in place for over a year\nRationales: First, let's start with eliminating unnatural options. Choices A, B, D are actions that have multiple, inconsistent meanings.\n1. A: jump\nSense 1: To make a sudden, forceful movement that may be accompanied by a jumping or leaping.\nSense 2: To force or eject suddenly or forcefully.\n2. B: to stand\nSense 1 - Sense 3: The action of standing on the ground or floor and maintaining an upright position by bracing the muscles of one's legs, knees, and feet.\n3. D: \"To sit\" Sense 1: to occupy in a position of rest, relaxation, or ease.\nSense 3: (phrasal verb) to move (oneself, or one's clothes, baggage etc.) into a position or attitude suitable for a given activity, occasion or action.\n2.  The options given in the original question are all the most natural meanings for the phrase \"to sit on one chair.\" There is no reason to leave out a very natural choice like sat from the options, as it is the most commonly used form of the phrase when a person is sitting.\n4. The choices given don\u2019t fit the action of the question, but can fit with the person's intention. While the intention may be for the person to stand on one chair, it is not the natural meaning for the action in the scenario.\n\n\nThe original question is phrased as if the person was doing a single action- they are sitting, but the question is asking about the person's intention, which is to stand. This is why we can't eliminate A: jump and E: stood in place.\n\nLet's look closer at the other answers.  One example of the common meaning for the action in this scenario is A: \"to jump\".

Choices: A: missed train B: daylight C: sunrise D: darkness E: light\nRationales: The question seeks to find the answer that explains the correct time of waking up and why it is necessary. Since each of the given options are related to what one sees at different times of the day, let us examine the options in detail and decide the reason for waking up at the correct time.\n\n### Step 1:\nLet us analyze each option and decide on the option that would explain the reason for getting up at the correct time of the day.\n\n### Option A:\nHere, we are asked about a missed train and one reason can be that it is late. So, missed train can be considered correct as it is about the train and explains the importance of getting up at the correct hour.\n\n### Steps 2 & 3: Option B & Option C:\nWe know that daylight comes at daytime and the daytime is what we need to wake up. Hence, they can be considered incorrect as they are not related to waking up at the right time\n\n### Option D:\nSince the question asks about getting up at the correct train, option D can be considered incorrect as darkness is what we find at night after the daytime.\n\n### Correct Option E:\nOption E suggests that light comes at daytime and we need to wake-up at the correct point so light can be found.\nAnswer: E: light\n\nInput: She needs a _______ and she doesn\u2019t like the ________.

The keyword is 'car'.\n\nStep 2. Let's consider an option which means an exact color. This eliminates option C.\n\nStep 2a: We can eliminate the option 'brand' because it is not a color.\n\nStep 9b: The option 'color' can probably mean color of a car.\n\nThe remaining options are price and model.\n\nStep 7a: Now, consider an option that refers to a brand. This answer choice probably means a brand of car.\n\nStep9a: Also, we can eliminate the option'model' because it does not mean 'color'.\n\nStep 9c: The answers are now: price and brand.\n\nStep 0. When we compare these two options, 'brand' is what is relevant to the keyword 'car'. That makes option B the answer to your question.\n\nStep \u00be. We can eliminate 'price' as an answer choice because a price refers to what you pay for a car, which makes a car a product.\n\nStep3c Since you're asking what the person was thinking about, but not what they're thinking about, the answer choice is still brand.\n\nAnswer: 1.

Choices:  Ticket A: baggage B: gate C: car D: parking E: bathroom\nRationales: There is a place for everything at the airport except for luggage. But luggage is not a place, therefore it doesn't fit with the choice options.\n\n1. Luggage belongs to ticket, but ticket is not a place, and therefore does not fit the choice options, so it is eliminated.\n\n2. The gate is a place, therefore it fits with the choice options. However, the gate cannot carry luggage, and therefore it is eliminated. \n\n3. Car means car and not luggage to carry, and therefore it does not fit.\n\n4. Parking is a place, but luggage is not allowed there.\n\n5. Bathroom is a place, but the luggage is not permitted there.

Considering the 5 choices, \"Yes, can\", \"Bake it\" are the most appropriate ones regarding'making a vegetable food'. And \"Bake it\" is the only choice that does both'vegetable' and'make a food' of it.\n2. \"Boil it\" only applies to water, and not vegetable. \n3. \"Fry it\", on the other hand, is not the right option. Vegetables cooked in oils typically do so only for garnish, whereas vegetables cooked in boils are usually vegetables that should stay crispy and crunchy; therefore, it does not apply.\n4. \"Microwave it\" can apply only to a dish that's already cooked since", "answer": "D: train station"}

Choices: 1. Firstly, let's analyze the question and understand what could a 'bus' represent.\n2. While bikes are usually used for transportation, bicycles can also be used to move objects, similar to pushing the bikes using the handle and not riding them.\n3. Thus, the term 'bus' could apply to anyone who is using the bikes.\n4. Additionally, the next choice options 'bike shop' and 'bike rental store' could also relate to the question because they sell and rent out bikes.\n5. However, the term 'bike shop' specifically refers to a shop that sells and maintains bikes, but the term 'bike rental' doesn't.\n6. 'Friends' can be another possible answer, as they may also rent out or sell bikes.\n7. 'College students' could possibly relate to bikes, but in this case, the person who is the student can also use the bikes as a way to move around. Thus, this option is not a definitively correct choice.\n8. Furthermore, 'cyclists' and 'bike enthusiasts' are also possible answers, but these are less likely to be used by someone who rents bikes.\n9. Therefore, we can confidently rule out 'college students' and 'bike shop' but can leave the other choices as options.\n10. Finally, the best option that refers to the use of bikes would be 'bike rental shop'. The phrase 'bus' is used as a metaphor for the purpose to transport something.\n11. The term 'bike rents' can be understood as renting bikes and also conveys the purpose of using the bicycle.\n12. Therefore, the answer for who is using the bicycles or bikes is 'bi", "answer": "C: house"}

The question is attempting to determine a location by the information provided in the story of a car crash.\n\nAnalyzing the question, we can start by eliminating options that do not fit with the information presented.\n\n2. Considering that this story took place in the countryside, we can eliminate 'R: gas station' from the list, since the countryside is not usually a location with gas stations.\n\n3. By analyzinig the remaining choices, we can identify options that are implausible due to the information provided.\n\n4. Consider the options that imply being in the water as a location.\n\n5. The location of the crashto would not be that remote or off the beaten path, so the option of 'M: city park' is clearly wrong. Also, the location of the car crash cannot be in the forest. This is easily demonstrated by the fact that a tree fell on the windshield of the car.\n\n6. Now, consider that the car crash took place on a highway, so we can eliminate 'S: highway'\n\n7. This leaves us with only two options: 'T: mountain tunnel' and 'D: forest'. The question does not specify if this is a highway or a rural route, but if this is a highway, the only option would be T: mountain tunnel, since forest is part of the environment of a rural or off the beaten track setting, while a forest is not on the highway, and would not be found on a city street.\n8.

Choices:  C: car A: bicycle B: bus E: boat\nRationales: The question asks about methods for people to access a particular station.\n\nOption A, bicycle, is a viable form of transportation if a station is inaccessible by car, e.g., a station in a heavily built-up area that does not allow cars to park nearby is inaccessible by options A and B.\n\nOption B, bus, does not transport people to a station. This excludes it from being the correct response to the question.\n\nOption E, boat, does not transport people either, which again eliminates it as the correct response.\n\nSince Option C, car, transports people, it is the correct response.\nAnswer: C: car\n\nInput: Where is water heated? Choices:  D: furnace C: kitchen A: boiler B: heater E: plumbing\nRationales: Water may be heated by a furnace, a kitchen, boiler, or a heater.\n\nOption A is a kitchen that may have a stove, which in turn could be heating water.\n\nOption B has a heater or boiler, which could be used to heat water.\n\nOption C is a furnace, which may be used to heat water, but does not directly heat water the way a boiler does.\n\nOption D is a plumbing system, which may contain pipes that have been used to heat water. It could also provide water.\n\nThe wording used to describe the question is \"water\" is heated, not \"an electric element\".\n\nElectric elements heat water. If Option C \"furnace\" is selected, an option must be considered based on that selection. \"Furnace\" could be referring to a central heater in a house. If that is the case, the answer is D. If the furnace is not part of a plumbing system in a house, and its only purpose is to heat water, then the answer is C.

You would normally not find this kind of person difficult to decide upon the direction of the next step.\n\nB: It is not clear what you mean by \"person without choices to select\". It is possible that this could be a 'decision makers' description, but it is also possible that this is just meant to be a random statement. Either way, it does not apply whatsoever if 'decision maker is excluded as it is implied by this choice that a decision maker is a person without choices to choose from.\n\nC: 'Indecisive' is the best possible interpretation of this choice. An indecisive person can have two outcomes, either they get stuck making a decision or they can decide on several choice until an alternative is ruled out. There is no other interpretation apart from these two and both are applicable.\nD: A person who plans their steps in advance will normally be able to decide on their next steps quite easily without difficulty.

While'rewrite' is related to history, it implies an editorial process - such as writing a new essay, etc. - and is not the same as trying to eliminate a part of history.\n8. Option D, 'play music', can also be considered, since a record is a medium on which music can be stored and played.\n9. However, burning a record seems to suggest trying to cover up some part of the history, therefore 'destroy' seems to better convey the intent.\n10. Finally, option E, 'erase', is related to history, but it is an action that can only be performed on data or a memory storage medium and is not related to burning a record which is a physical object. \n11. When we compare that options alongside the context of the question, it appears that B, 'burn' is the best choice as 'burn' more closely conveys trying to eliminate some aspect of history, in comparison to other choices.\nAnswer: B.

The question gives a specific situation and requests an action or consequence for it.\n2. Each option could potentially apply to the given situation.\n3. Option A: the phone could have been given for free in conjunction with a new pre-paid subscription of some kind.\n4. Option B: It could be a sign of distress to the recipient due to not having already paid for the phone.\n5. Option C: The person might have gotten a new \"fake\" number to replace the original one on their phone.\n6. Option D: The person could have had a stolen or re-purposed phone. \n7. Option E: The phone could be a sign of financial or economic hardship to the person.\n8. The options about phone can be easily ruled out if the phrase \"for free\" was just a simple descriptive phrase rather than being an action or consequence in the context.\n9. In the scenario from the question, the phrase 'getting the phone for free' implies some action was taken or some consequence occurred. \n10. Taking action is always something voluntary and as a result, \"getting\" the phone can only be a consequence of the fact they were given a phone.\n11. So, the only option left that could be associatively related to the phrase 'getting the free' is'receiving a phone'.\n12. This is because getting a phone for free is only an option and not a necessity (which we can exclude in the options about phone).\n13. In a sense, it is one's personal choice to 'buy' the phone and as a result,'receiving a phone' could be the phrase that fits the scenario. \n14. To re-evaluate, the customer could have been given a phone as a gift instead of payment. This is not mentioned in the phrase but implied by the options which is why it has to be eliminated at the start.\n\n15. So, the only remaining option is'receiving a free phone'.\n16.

There are four elements in the list: hydrogen, oxygen, iodine, and calcium. We don't know if they are in the water (like in hot water) or within the water (like dissolved in the water).

Ca2+ is a very weak electrolyte in water. This means any amount of it is more likely to be found dissolved in water rather than existing in the water.\n\nStep 0\n\nTherefore, based on the provided options, we can eliminate two as not relevant: iodine and calcium.\n\nStep $11$: Therefore the correct answer could be either B or D depending on which is actually correct.\nAn answer has to be selected according to the given context.\nAnswer: Either  B: oxygen or  D: helium\n\nInput: The man is talking about what?

Choices: 1: on a desk 2: under a desk 3: next to a desk 4: near a desk 5: around a desk 6: on a shelf 7: in the desk\nRationales:  1. First, let\u2019s understand the phrasing of the options. In the first option, a calendar is stated to be 'on a desk'.\n\nIn the second and third options, it is mentioned to be 'under a desk'.\n2. 'Next to a desk', 'near a desk', or 'around a desk' mean \u2018by\u2019 a desk, which indicates location relative to the desk. \n3. It is unlikely that 2, 3, or 6 is going to describe a calendar as there will be several such items nearby. This would mean that the calendar is on a shelf where items are located, with a shelf often being used to store items. \n4. The fifth option states that the calendar is 'in the desk'.\n\n5. In the sixth option, the calendar is stated to be in the desk, but not on the desk or under the desk. This is ambiguous, as the description \u2018in the desk\u2019 might mean the desk is made of calendar.\n6. The seventh option states the calendar is in the desk. This, combined with the fact that it is on a shelf, means the shelf is the desk. Option 5 can thus be discarded.\n7. Lastly, based on the analysis, we have narrowed the options to three \u2013 1, 6, and 7.\n8. The calendar most likely to be in an office is option 6, that is, 'on a shelf'.\n9. Option 7 is \u2018in the desk,\u2019 which can also be 'on the desk'. This can\u2019t be ruled out since the options are close.\n10. Option 1 is 'on a desk,' which is the most likely option, but it is not a calendar since a desk can be placed in a room, but it can\u2019t also be a desk.

{"text": "record is'remove part of history'.\nAnswer: D: play music\n\nInput: Who is the artist to the portrait? Choices:  Artist A: Jane Smith B: Bob Brown C: John Jones D: Julia Johnson E: Linda Miller\nRationales: The best way to understand the options is to understand the definition of 'portrait'. A 'portrait' is a 'narrative', and that narrative is 'painted', which may lead us to assume that the 'artist' is somehow painted as a part of the portrait, or even the person being painted. 1. Consider the options:\na. We don't have full names of the choices, but the last names of the choices start with A-G and include names such as Smith (indicative of male gender) and Jones (possible gender ambiguity). Both of these suggest that none of the choices are female.\nb. A male is excluded from the choices, and Smith is not a 'first name', so none of the choices start with the letter 'J'. This means only A, B, and C are possible.\nc. The options A, B, and D do not include the name 'Julia', yet the options that do have a name starting with 'J', which might suggest that any names are also possible.\nd. The letter 'J' is very specific in relation to gender, a man's name with this letter often indicates John, a female often starts with J-U, etc. 'Jane', with a single 'A' before 'J', is more specific than a name starting with just 'J' and indicates female gender.\ne. Last, to make it easier for the reader to process and comprehend the options in the list, the best choice is that which will make the least amount of work for the brain and will therefore be processed first. Among the choices, A: Jim, B: Joe, and C: James are the easiest to process since they are all three syllables and therefore the most immediately recognisable. In addition, there is no clear indication whether the 'Artist' is male or female. It might be helpful to look at a similar question with a gender bias to observe the answer.\n\nAnswer: A: James\n\n### Discussion:\nThe choices for the following statements is in the format of a question.

E: by telling the time period\nRationales: Start by analyzing each choice and its implications.\n1. This option is an example of 'explaining background' and would be relevant if the writer wanted to give details about the background of someone else.\n2. Emotion or state of mind are relevant to a narrator's thoughts and perspective. This choice is irrelevant.\n3. This option refers to a list of facts, but it is not related to information about a narrator's history.\n4. Explaining actions would be relevant if the actions were of significance compared to other things in the narrative. \n5. This choice is relevant if the story is set in a particular time period but it would be better to refer to other options if the focus was on the narrator.\nAnswer: A & D\n\nInput: What type of food do Americans eat for a meal?

Choices:  *A: Animals are colorblind* B: Animals are color sensitive* C: Animals can detect color* D: Animals cannot detect color* E: Animals have excellent vision\n\nRationales: The sentence is saying that wearing red would prevent one from being seen by a wild animal. This may be because animals have a good sense of colour or because they are colorblind.\n\nAs an aside note, not all animals need to see color to be able to detect prey. Colorblindness only occurs in a few species of animals (though many are nocturnal and use other means to hunt), and even humans who are colorblind have been known to detect color and detect movement. \n\nIt doesn't completely matter which answer is correct as there are multiple explanations for the sentence.\n\nAnswer: E: Animals have exceptional vision\n\n### Instrument Rationale 1\n* The instrument asks about a sentence's meaning.\n* Note that there is generally one correct answer to each question: as it is a yes/no question.

Choices:  a. warehouse b. factory c. store d. computer company e. warehouse\nRationales: Start by analyzing the options using the context and meaning of the word 'pick up'. \n\nStep 1: The question mentions the action of picking up an item. Picking up an item usually implies that it is an item that needs to be delivered to you at a different location. \n\nStep2: Each of the given options corresponds to a different type of company or place. They must be evaluated with the context of the question. \n\nStep3: Option A: warehouse - A warehouse is a place where items are stored, which could include the item that must be picked up.\n\nStep4: Options B and C: factory and store - A factory is a place where items like clothes are manufactured and a store is a place where items can be purchased, however neither of these seem to correspond with the answer. \n\nStep5: Option E: computer company - The given question is about an item that must be picked and delivered. A computer company could correspond to this but not all computer companies manufacture things, some may not need to pick up items.

{"text": "record in history is erasing things, which is associated with the intentional elimination of things (which is what burning is).\nAnswer: D: erase\n\nInput: What does the person probably be looking for? Choices: \n\nA: clothes B: food C: home D: car \nE: vacation\n\nRationales: Start by analyzing the question and the options we have available to choose from.\nIn each case, the options are all nouns in English that could be related to \"looking for\".\n\nExamine choice A, \"clothes\".\nWhile clothes are often an item one can look for, the word \"clothes\" is not a particular individual piece of apparel. Still, there's a possibility that the question does in fact refer to clothes that are being sought out.\n\nContinue analyzing other choices. Evaluate each piece for further analysis, until you locate the one (or more likely set) of best fits.\n\nConsider choice B, \"food\". While food can be an item an individual can look for, it is possible that the question doesn't directly refer to this noun as many other nouns can be considered as substitutes. E.g., there's a possibility someone is seeking out'meals','snacks', or 'drinks', which are similar to food and that is what the person is likely looking for - e.g. food\n\nChoice C, \"home\". In terms of grammar this word is referring to a specific physical location that can have other nouns like 'rooms'. The question doesn't directly indicate a specific noun so it's probably not a great match.\n\nChoice D, \"car\". While a \"car\" is something that a person could look for, it's not a definite noun as someone could be seeking out a specific type of vehicle (e.g. sports car).\n\nEvaluate choice E, \"vacation\". This choice has the potential to directly answer this question based on grammar and meaning. The person could literally be looking for 'vacation' as it is an abstract concept that can be sought by a person just like food, clothes, home, and car. \n\nAnswer: E: vacation\n\nInput: To do what to the clock, we should set the time on it. \n\nChoices", "answer": "E: read book"}

This time we must figure out the relation between the directions and the holding in the mind.\n*2.The directions A, B, C, D and E all indicate directions. This means that we seek to understand what part of the phrase indicates the way of holding things one can use while moving in that specific direction.\n*3.There are a lot of possibilities here; a person can hold a map with notes for directions in their head, a small item they want to remember, their dog, food, umbrella, etc.\n*4.So, we will go through the options one by one trying to evaluate if we can attribute the act of holding something to the indicated direction.\n*5. The direction East can describe a specific geographical location from where things from Northwest, Southwest, Southeast, and North are heading; or the direction could mean a sense of the things in the direction you are moving.\n*6.Things in Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest could travel to any direction if the wind is blowing; so, the relation of Northwest or its direction isn't clear.\n*7.If our thought is related to geography then the option should be A but this is not the case; we haven't been provided any information to support this link.\n*8.Since the direction Southeast is a compass or map location where things from Southwest, Southeastern, and South areas can come or go, the association of South may be applicable here.\n*9.However, since we are moving from East, then our holding will be to the right and not to the South, and this rule is applicable to all given directions.\n*10.Only if our holding refers to an item we are travelling with it can change direction with our movement in that direction.\n*11.Therefore, we can conclude that an item we are travying with, can change direction with our direction. So, our holding could be interpreted as an item we hold", "answer": "E: office building"}

Choices A and B are both viable options. Choice A, the 'object that he can see or otherwise detect' may be the correct answer. But since this is a guessing game there is no reason to guess only one choice: the character could be looking for an object that he cannot see while it is actually right there in front of him, or he may be looking for an object he can't see while it's actually in his bag.2. Choice B seems unrelated or off-topic. The option that the character 'is looking for it on the kitchen table' may relate to the option that the character is'remembering to put it in his suitcase'.\n\n### Task:\n#####Inputs:\nJason is cleaning his yard\n\nThis is going to take time.

Let's begin by first analyzing each option.\n1. A: Arms\n2. B: Legs\n3. C: Arms, and legs\n4. D: Fingers\n5. E: Claws\n6. Option B: Legs are what part of the body that birds do in fact have long toes?\n7. Anything with long toes is considered a leg in this context because in mammals, toes are associated with feet, legs, and arms.\n8. However, this answer is incorrect because birds have long toes on their arms.\n9. Now, we should look at each of the incorrect answers to see which makes the most sense for this question:\n10. Answer A: Arms\n11. Here, the question states the bird has long toes, then asks which body part has the long toes.\n12. Arms do not have long toes. Long toes are found on legs and feet, not arms.\n13. Therefore, this answer cannot be correct.\n14. Answer D: Fingers would similarly not be a correct answer. Birds have long toes not fingers.\n15. Answer E: Claws may be an option that might be the correct answer, as claws may be associated with toes, and birds do have long toes. But, the question did not specify long claws. We can eliminate this option because the long toes are specifically associated with the legs, not the claws.\n16.

When considering choices, they must have some association with the gift's intended recipient, as they must respond to that recipient.\n2. 'Open it' does not fit due to the sentence '... and will also be given to...' that shows it will be given to someone else and 'open it' would not be a feasible option after giving it to someone else since it has already been opened.\n3. 'Forget it' would not be considered since there is no mention of forgetting a gift in the question and 'forget' only seems relevant to memories.\n4. 'Accept it' is not viable either. Accepting a gift means agreeing that it's what you're hoping for or that you're thankful for it even if you don't like it. So, 'accept it' does not seem to be the appropriate response since this answer should also be considered by someone else while considering an alternative gift and 'accept' does not seem like an option to consider after accepting a gift.\n5. 'Refuse it' would also not be suitable as it would mean refusing the recipient.\n6. As'return it' also does not make a lot of sense given the context of the questions since a gift would not likely have been given to someone and then be returned again unless it was sent back to the sender.\n7. Finally, 'accept it' is the best fit given the context of the statement given and the gift that will be given to someone.\nAnswer: B. open it\n\nInput: How should the person move?

Choices: A: shopping mall B: concert hall C: arena D: cinema E: opera house\nRationales: Start with each of the choices to understand how each may serve as an answer to our question.\n1. 'Mall' is a general type of shopping complex, so it is excluded. \n2. 'Concert hall' and 'arena' are not types of theaters, they are places or building where events are held. \n3. 'Cinema' and 'opera house' could be correct, but 'cinema' is often used specifically to refer to a particular kind of theater. \n4. Thus, the correct answer is 'theater'.\nAnswer: A. theater\n\n### Instructons:Answer the question.\n\nWhat is different with a book if it made from a single sheet of paper that folded to form 250 pages each side twice? Choices: A : printed B : bound C: colorful D: hardcover E: paperback\nRationales: Consider each choice to determine the best answer.\n1. 'Printed' book contains illustrations printed on paper such as posters, books, comics, etc. \n2. Books made from a single sheet are called pamphlets or leaflets and usually contain less than 20 pages. \n3. So the answer may not be the correct type of book. \n4. 'Bound' is not an option because the book is not bound. \n5 'Colorful' could be the case if the cover were made of different colors. \n6. But, this is not necessarily the case. \n7. Book with a hard cover, called 'hardcover', contains usually a number of pages bound together with hard boards or a flexible plastic binding, such as hardcover books in the American Library Association's (ALA) standard book classification system. \n8. 'Paperback' means the cover of the book is made of paper, but this is not the type of the books we are talking about. \n9. The correct answer is 'printed'.", "answer": "A: zoo"}

Choices: 1) Excuse me, may I take that? 2) Do we have anything else to purchase? 3) That is 3 dollars. 4) I have two 3 dollar bills. 5) Do we sell one dollar bills? 6) Will you have change?\n7) Would it be possible to give you 5 dollars? 8) I do not have that much money with me today.\n\nRationales: We can eliminate 1), 2), 3), 4), 5) and 6) for the following reasons:\n1) No one ever asks for change like that. Whenever someone asks for change, they first ask for smaller denominations, such as a $1 for a $5 or a $2 for a $10.\n2) Since 2) is already answered (See 1), there are no more two dollar bills available. Why would the cashier ask for more two dollar bils?\n3) 3) is correct. Whenever someone says, 'Is that $3, or $...' they're asking for change.\n4) 4) is also correct. People also ask for a $1 or $2 to be able to pay with an even dollar.\n5) 5) should also be incorrect. A clerk at a cash register will never ask if the customer is buying one dollar bills. It's probably asking if the customer is buyer a one dollar bill and is looking for change.\n6) 6) is also correct. The answer should be yes, the cashier should give him change since the clerk can't give out change without cashing out from the money drawer. Also, 7), 8), 9), 10), and 11) should also be the same, as in they can be removed since the first question is why the clerk does not want to give someone three dollars.\n\nAnswer: 12), 'I don't have that much money with right now.'\n\n#### Explanation", "answer": "C: bar"}

Choices:  I: grapefruits II: oranges III: lemons and IV: limes.\nRationales: First, let's examine and compare the given choices carefully to find out the type of limes which are used the most and which are not widely available.\n\nA. Choice I mentions grapefruits. Grapefruit varieties and types are numerous and vast, and grapefruits are more commonly used as ornamental decorations in homes rather than as a food item. These are sometimes referred to as 'decorative pot plants'.\nB. Choice II mentions oranges. Orange trees, like grapefruits, are more widespread and commonly cultivated in certain hot, arid parts of the world, than limes or lemons. Oranges are the best-known and most widely available of the citrus fruits used for culinary purposes.\nC. Choice III refers to lemons and limes. While both citrus fruits are cultivated for commercial use in many parts of the world, limes are the preferred citrus fruit used in many countries.\nD. Choice IV refers to limes. Limes, like lemons, belong to the Citrus genus and can be used for a variety of culinary purposes.\nTherefore, it can be concluded that limes are generally better known and more widespread than lemons and therefore, the choice that best matches the requirements is choice III.Answer: C: lemons and limes\n\nInput: What do you call someone who has a high tolerance for alcohol?

Choices:  I want to buy I buy you should buy A: apples B: potatoes C: carrots D: oranges E: mushrooms\nRationales: Let us list down the items available along with their respective reasons:\n1. Apples - for dessert/snacks \n2. Potatoes - used in mashed foods \n3. Carrots - used in stews \n4. Oranges - for juice/eating \n5. Mushrooms - for spaghetti \n6. In the first few alternatives, you clearly see the choices relate to eating / using the vegetables. \n7. While the choices might be valid as a reason to buy the vegetables, the choice for eating does not answer the question. \n\nStep two: We now have to rule down the possible alternatives (carrots/oranges/mushrooms) that can be considered the correct answer and for that, we will have to analyze the options: \n1. For carrots: They are used in cooking recipes. As per dictionary definition, cooking is \"to add heat to food or other material until the desired results are achieved \u2013 usually to produce the best change in taste, appearance, or consistency\". Carrot is used in the cooking process of a lot of dishes. \n2. For oranges: As per dictionary and common knowledge, oranges are used for eating/cooking and juicing - all of which were covered in step (Step) one. \n3. For mushrooms: Mushrooms are used to flavor other foods - and cooking is a primary use for them. \n\nTherefore, combining what we already have and the information from step two, the correct answer is \"to cook'!

Choices: 1) dealer 2) mechanic 3) retail tire 4) tire shop 5) junkyard\nRationales: The question's choices are each a possible context or location where a tire could be taken to have it mounted into a vehicle. It is a scenario that can occur in any of these locations. Consider the given reasons, and identify the context that best fits to answer this question correctly.\n\n1. Dealer - 'Taking' can refer to removing something or giving something, so while this may be a context for mounting tires, it may not be the primary purpose for bringing a tire to a dealer.\n\n2. Mechanic - Mechanics can take tires to have them mounted, but they also fix vehicles, so while this may indeed occur, this isn't a key activity of a mechanic and thus isn't a likely context.\n\n3. Retail - 'Retail tire' can refer to a large store or chain, but in this context, we are taking a tire for mounting. As a result, this doesn't seem like an applicable context.\n\n4. Tire shop - A shop sells or repairs tires, so this location is a definite possibility, but it's not the main reason why one would bring a tire here.\n\n5. Junkyards - A junkyard is a place that sells old cars, as well as taking apart cars and selling the parts. Tires can be found and sold in junkyards, but it'd still be a minor activity as compared to the main activities of sales and car dismantling.\n\nFrom the above analysis, it's possible that the person in the given scenario is bringing the tire to a tire shop, but it can also happen at a junkyard.\n\nAnswer: 3 and 5, which are junkyards and tire shops\n\nInput: There's a car on a tire shop which just got painted, why is the car parked in front of another building?

Choices:  F: Your brother B: Your sister C: Nobody D: Your parents E: Your mother\nRationales: The answer choices are your brother B, your sister C, your parents D, and your mother E. By analyzing these answer choices, we can see what each choice means:\n\n1. F: Your Brother. If siblings are going to switch remote batteries, it's likely that each sibling will have to do so at some point (unless the batteries only last a short amount of time and they need to swap batteries every day). This means, your brother is at least the one of you that will have to swap the battery or batteries once. As your brother will have to swap the batteries eventually, this is not the right answer.\n\n2. B: Your Sister. Similar to the case above about your brother, your sister is likely to swap batteries on the remote eventually. As your sister will have to swap the remote batteries as well, this is also not the right answer. \n\n3. C: Nobody. While your siblings could swap batteries, it doesn't seem to be a common occurrence. If siblings were to swap batteries, it is likely that they would have to change the batter in almost identical amounts of time, to preserve as much battery", "answer": "C: garden"}

Choices: 1: at center court, 2: at tennis court, 3: at outdoor court, 4: at indoor court, 5: at soccer field\nRationales: This question is asking a logical inference with the correct answer 4 as the answer.\n1. The phrase actors standing indicates that they are actors or performing a skit. (Rule of thumb: if it is logical inference the actors are doing a skit and not at center court or something like that)\n2. The phrase being shot indicates a filming session. ( Rule of thumb: If it's a scene for a movie being shot, it's logical to guess a filming crew).\n3. The phrase soccer field indicates football, which is not logical to assume in the context of the question. (Rule of thumb : It makes logical sense to assume it is an outdoor court, similar to an indoor court)\n4. The phrase indoor court indicates tennis court because the word indoor would lead an assumption of a non outdoor environment.\n5. The phrase outdoor court indicates tennis court by the context, since it is outdoor and not at a soccer field or a center court.\n6.

Choices: \tA: good for her B: good for him C: he isn't around anymore D: she wasn't in a good mood E: she was mad at him\nRationales: By analyzing each choice, we can understand how the choices may fit in the context of being able to conclude something about a person who has belongings by the sidewalks. We should look at 'good for her' and'she isn't around anymore' as they do relate in the sense that she isn't physically present, so she may have left already hence not around anymore. The next 'he wasn't in a bad mood' doesn't seem to relate. She may not be in a bad mood but it doesn't mean he isn't around and so on. By eliminating these choices, we can come to the conclusion that the most matching answer which relates directly to this context is'she wasn't in a mood to share'. The final answer 'he wasn't around anymore' and'she wasn't a good mood' remain ambiguous with regards to the context. \n\nAnswer: The correct answer is \u2018she wasn't in good mood to share\u2019 and not he wasn't around anymore.\n\nInput: A dog had to cross a very busy street, what did the dog do? Choices: 1.\tA: ran over a crossing 2.\tB: got hit 3.\tC: jumped over a curb 4.\tD: crawled under a bush 5.\tE: got lucky\nRationales: As you can see, in this sentence, the dog isn't a \"she\" or \"him\"; it's a \"her\". So, to answer the question, it should be one of the other four choices. Each choice provides some sort of a clue about what the dog may have done.\nFor instance, in A, the dog ran over a crossing, which is a safe place for crossing a busy street. Here, the dog is behaving as it should, but something bad happens.\nB tells us the dog got hit; the dog didn't", "answer": "E: getting tired"}

Choices:  \"A: He sat \"B: He sat while walking C: He sat on the chair D: He sat after walking \"E: He sat sitting on \"\nRationales: This question asks to determine 1. what the boy did and whether there is only one verb or many verbs associated with a past time. \nStep 1: Start by analyzing the phrasing of the sentence and then the given answer choices.\n\nStep2: Each answer choice uses a verb from the previous phrase in the context of a time of the past. So, they are the correct answer choices.\n\nNext, we should understand that the boy sat on the chair.\n\nStep 1: Based on the answer choices, we can see that:\n1. It is a single verb\n2. The verb is'sat' but it is associated with the phrase 'on the chair'.\n3. We know the boy sat on the 'chair' which means he sat somewhere in the past.\n\nStep 2  : The boy sat is more than just a single verb as it describes two things: sitting down and sitting on a chair. To explain, if he sat on a chair, he sat down, but he sat down on a chair and not just sitting down.\n\nStep \nStep 3: Option A reads 'He sat'. Based on what steps were done before, we can infer that He sat implies that boy just'sat' and nothing more.\n\nStep  Step 4: Option B reads 'He sat while walking'. We have to interpret \"walking\" as something that may not be completely associated with the phrase sitting because 'walking' is not a verb from 'on the chair' and 'walking is not a verb from the previous 'the boy sat'.\n\nStep 5 : Therefore, the correct answer cannot be B.\n\nStep  - Step 6: Option C reads 'He sat on the chair'. This is similar to option A except it adds a description associated with 'He sat' in the past.\nStep 7: Option D reads 'He sat after walking'.

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: C.\n\nInput: What are you in if in the ocean? Choices: \n\nA: fish B: ship C: ocean floor D: warehouse E: air\nRationales: The solution starts by looking carefully at the whole question and observing the options: A) fish, B) ship, C) ocean floor, D) warehouse, and E) air. We begin by figuring out if the answer choice is related to the question somehow. For example, fish is relevant because they swim in the ocean. Likewise, air is relevant since it is part of an airplane that might fly over the ocean. The other three are not relevant to the question. If either option is relevant, we can then eliminate other options since they are not related to a relevant answer choice. Let's first eliminate options from D and E since there are not relevant: D) we can eliminate the warehouse because warehouses do not contain oceans of water. E) we can eliminate air because oceans do not contain air. We can then move onto C and B. If either of these is an option that is relevant, then we can move onto B and eliminate D and E. However, since both C and B are unrelated to the question, we can eliminate them as well. Since all answers fit into a larger context of the meaning of the question, we can then confidently select the top answer: C) a ship.\n\nAnswer: C.

In addition, B needs to be a gift card because you can only receive money if there is an amount to be received on a gift card. This is not the case for an actual loan. In addition, C needs to be a credit card, because you get a line of credit from a bank when you apply for a credit card.

First of all, the given options can be classified into three categories:\n1. 'Move the game'; we can see that this option is about the time, not about the place.\n2. 'Catching'; this action may be related to catching the ball and continuing with the game. In this case, the choice is not suitable.\n3. 'Pasted on'; this means 'pasted on' to a wall. Given that this is a sports questionnaire, the answer should not be related to a wall or painting.\nHence, we have to discard this choice.\n4. 'Scored'; this means to score, which may occur when a goal is scored. In this case, we see that this is not the answer to the question.\n5. 'Rolls and passes'; this action may be similar to the act of catching, which is mentioned in the previous choice. If it was the case, we could have chosen this option. But it is more likely that by passing the ball, the team attempts to make a pass to one of their teammates to move the game.\n6. Then, we see that rolling on the pitch to advance the game is the action that best fits the context in the question and the given options. Therefore, this would be the answer to the question above.\nAnswer: B': rolling on the pitch\n\nInput: Which person is likely to get a raise?

Choices:  the album  : A: picture B: memory C: a song D: their life E: their story\nRationales: The Question is about what we can keep by placing a picture in an album.\n\n1. The album itself represents where the photo is stored so that it is possible to preserve the picture and is thus a suitable answer.\n2. A memory is stored in the brain in a nonphysical way so it is not suitable.\n3. A song, being a part of culture, is kept in a different kind of structure called culture which can still be saved and thus is not suitable.\n4. This eliminates these three options.\n5.

Choices:  a campaigner B: person C: advocate D: critic E: supporter\nRationales:\n\n1. We must first examine the word 'campaigner' to understand the context the word is used in and whether it correctly describes what the question is asking.\n2. A campaigner is described as a person who engages in political or social activism and promotes a specific cause to attain a goal.\n3. This definition can be applied to the question as the answer is supposed to be someone who wants to change a rule and is thus, a supporter of the intended change.\n4. To identify the option that best matches with both the usage of the word campaigner and the intent of the question, the choices must be analyzed.\n5. Choices A, B, and C do not fit with the context of the question; they rather describe the action or a specific purpose of the action and not the individual. As there is nothing campaigning about someone who advocates for themselves, nor a decision wherein one has any desire to change any rules, advocating in context is not suitable.\n6.

The doctor needs to figure out what a patient is afflicted of.\n2. bacterial infection, thin, heart attack and heart disease are inappropriate choices because they answer something different from what is asked in the question; it is looking for the diagnosis by the doctor.\n3. On the other hand, the choices of a. medical history, d. medication or treatment are close to what the question is asking for and these are valid choices.\n4.

Choices: \nA: store B: shelf C: garage D: bathroom E: bedroom\nRationales: The question is about where one can be shopping while looking at a piece of metall. The important takeaway from this is that this action can be done in more than just one location, and the different options present themselves as reasonable possibilities. \n\nStep one:\n\nStart by analyzing each choice and considering the scenario.\n\nStep two:\n\nLook at the given choices and eliminate the choices that are clearly not relevant.\n\nStep three:\n\nCompare any remaining options and identify the one that is most similar to the scenario.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we are left with the following options: store B, shelf and bathroom E.\n\nStep four:\n\nEliminate the choice that doesn't fit the correct response.\n\nStep five:\n\nNow, determine which is a similar location in terms of the action taken in the question.\n\nStep six:\n\nSince the action in the question is 'looking at a piece of metal', B and E are the best choices.\n\nStep seven:\n\nLook at both choices in the question and determine which choice is better suited to the question.\n\nB (store) is the only logical choice as a bathroom is not a place of shopping.\n\nStep eight:\n\nDetermine from the responses which best matches the question.\n\nAnswer: B: store\n\nInput: What happens if you use too much spray tan?

For the first one: Glass A: Refrigerator is not an option for getting milk as you need glass to get milk, you will not get milk in the fridge.\n\n2. For the second one: B: Shelf is not the option as it is a thing for placing things, and milk is usually placed on the table.\n\n3. For the third one: C: Milk is given as the answer as milk is used for drinking. Therefore, C: Milk is the answer.\n\n4.

Food groups refer to various types of food that share common features and serve similar nutritional functions. We'd say that \"apple, pear, watermelon\" is a good example of fruit but not vegetables.\n\nAnalyze the answers in context to the question.\n\nChoice A: This answer group is not relevant; 'rice, beans, tomato, onion' is a common vegetable group among many people, however, the food doesn't group under food groups as the question implies.\n\nChoice B: This answer group is a misleading grouping of foods as the question suggests.", "answer": "A: get smart"}

Choices:  A) Bread B C Pepperoni D E Garlic F Cheese\nRationales: The options given can be categorized into three distinct groupings:\n\n- 'Bread', 'Pepperoni', 'Garlic', and 'Cheese' are related to pizza dish\n\n- 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'F' aren't related, which could suggest an intent to bring or carry anything from the pizza\n\n- 'B' 'C' 'E' and 'F' are all food ingredients of pizza\n\nBecause 'B' 'C', 'D' and 'F' aren\u2019t related, we can eliminate that group of options. Then, we analyze the food group to understand which type of food could be the answer for the puzzle.\n\nAfter further analysis, only 'B' 'C\u2019 'D' and 'E' are related, while 'Cheese' is unrelated.\n\nTherefore the answer is E: Garlic, and the reason is because a pizza is formed using various food ingredients and garlic could be an ingredient in some pizza recipes.\n\nAnswer: E: Garlic\n\nInput: He said he would never pay to get an item. Choices: A. The dog will eat something B. My mom will love to pay for me C D E The item is in demand F The item could be in the shop G I will not pay for the item\nRationales: From the given options, we notice that there\u2019s a pattern, one of the options is related to a pet. If someone is not willing to pay for an item then that item is not in demand so we can eliminate choice B by the usage of the word \u201cdemand\u201d.\n\nChoice A is a pet of the person and that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t use an \u201citem\u201d not to mention the \u201cwill\u201d (this would mean will eat food as a present) and so Choice A is not the best option.

Choices:  Focus, distraction, memory, attention, observation\nRationales: Questions about attention and awareness require an understanding of the different words and how they are related.\n2. Attention (answer: focus)\n    a. attention means awareness or focus on an object or event\n    b. Focus describes the idea of turning your attention or awareness on something, either something in the past or the present.\nc. \n\n    i. Observation = a focus on someone or something.\n        ii. Memory = a focus on something that happened in the past.\n2. Distraction\n    * It isn't the correct match for focussing because focussing on something doesn't necessarily mean it's the opposite of distract, in fact, one can be distracted when focussing on something.\n        * It also isn't the best choice out of the given options because other definitions like to divert someone's mind from the point or course, which is not required to be the target in order to use the option 'distraction'.\n2. Observation (answer: distraction)\n    * It does not fit the requirement to focus one's attention, instead observation can only mean looking at something or someone.\n2. Memory (answer: attention)\n    * Memory doesn't match focussing because it means storing something from the past, not paying enough attention like the requirement is about here.\n2. The remaining options are all about attention and awarenesses and they can fit the requirement.\n3. Distraction and observation are the best match for a focus.\n4. They all mean that one's attention or awareness is redirected or diverted toward something different.\n5. Focus isn't a match because it means one's attention is directed to the target. \n\n6. Distraction and observation will work best for the question. We will answer both distraction and observation.\nAnswer: A & B: distraction / A & B: observation.\n\nInput: Who is the manager if attendees were being checked in?

Choices:  (1) A: spaghetti (2) B: broccoli (3) C: apple pie (4) D: banana (5) E: potatoes\nRationales: (1) When the question asks about making an entity in the kitchen, we need to understand from context. (2) In the context, cooking spaghetti would be a suitable action based on the option provided. (3) Cooking a pie in a kitchen would not make any logical sense considering the rest of the options, so it is discarded. (4) We'll look at the other side of the coin and consider making bananas, which can be done in the kitchen. (5) Making potatoes is not usually done in the kitchen as potatoes are cooked differently than everything else that can be made in the kitchen. (6) Broccoli would not make much sense as it would require special utensils like a food processor to make. (7) Similarly making macaroni would not be practical as a food processor or hot pot in the kitchen is needed to cook it. (8) So, cooking apple pie is the only suitable option from the provided options. (9) We can eliminate banana and broccoli and we will go ahead with apple pie. (10) Now, comparing alternatives (1) and (2) we can conclude that spaghetti cannot be made in the kitchen and only apple pie can be made. (11) Therefore option (2), which says apple pie, should be chosen. \nAnswer:2: apple pie\n\nInput: What can a person hear in a bathroom?

Choices:  E: the steak was raw  D: it was too salty  B: tasty E: spicy C: very good  A: yummy\nRationales: The word used in the sentence 'they thought of' implies that they think of something, as opposed to 'they were given'. Therefore, we have to determine what they 'thought' about the meal.\n1. We can eliminate option D because it is not a sentence structure that can be used to describe a 'thought'.\n2. Option E: \"The steak was raw' seems to suggest the people thought the steak was raw by way of tasting it, and found it to be so. This, however, is incorrect as it does not convey a thought but rather the finding of an object's state.\n3. Option C: \"very good\" is too vague as it would be incorrect to conclude this.\n4. Option B: 'Tasty' is an appropriate option with the 'thought' phrase, as it would be the correct way to describe a thought.\n5. The question asked for the response that sounds most unambiguous, and the best response would be \"tasty.\"\nAnswer: B: tasty\n\nInput: If your reading magazines sitting and waiting on a vehicle on rails, what are you at?

We can see that choices D, E and B are irrelevant to the question as they're not a place where one waitting for vehicles on rails and read magazines. Choices C and D are the most applicable.\n1. First, start with options A and B. Train station and bookstores may sell magazines but they are not an appropriate place to reading them. Additionally, we can rule out these as they don't have to do with reading magazines and waiting for vehicles on rails.\n2. The only option left to assess is the train station. \n\nThe question asks for one to identify where one is sitting and", "answer": "A: store"}

Choice:  A: pencil, paper B: pile of sand C: pile of dirt D: pile of rocks E: trash\n\nRationales:\n\n1.The given answer, B: a pile of sand, is an acceptable answer to a question about what the correct answer might be.\n\n2.The correct answer would be given for things, or items which are piles of sand.\n\n3.This is because 'a pile of sand' is a thing which we would find in a pile.\n\n4.A pile of sand has shape and size: its form is a pile, and each pile would come in different sizes.\n\n5.This means 'a pile of dirt' could be the right answer.\n\n6.If you look at a picture of a pile of dirt, you will not see it as a single pile. Instead, you will see many piles on top of each other and scattered around one another, which would be much more difficult to draw compared to 'a pile of rocks'.\n\n7.Furthermore, the phrase 'a pile of rock' does not match the question's tone, which gives us hints as to the answer we would be looking for.\n\n8.For example, an illustration that uses the words, 'a pile of stone' will show a large, singular piece of stone, whereas the illustration that uses 'a pile of pebbles' would be showing something that looks like a pile of small stones.\n\n\nAnswer:\n\nB, they would be piles of dirt.\n\nAnswer:\nThe answer is B: a pile, as opposed to piles, of sand.\n\nInput: Where did they want to take their vacation?

{"text": "record is 'erasing'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: Which food is better for cooking, potatoes, or carrot? Choices:  C: potatoes A: carrot B: both C: broccoli D: none of the above\nRationales: Note: Before answering the question, be certain of the meaning of the foods used. \"Carrot\" refers to the vegetable and \"potatoes\" refer to \"potato\" without the \"s.\" While \"broccoli\" is a type of flower, the question implies that it will be cooked in a kitchen or similar environment containing tools often associated with preparing food.\n1. The phrase \u201cCooking is better for\u201d should be read as \"When cooking, it is better [\u2026]\" which in turn asks which food is better for being cooked.\n2. None of the other options fits well with the question or requires more thinking.\n3. Option A indicates that neither potatoes nor carrots are better for cooking.\n4. Option B can be eliminated as it is not an option for the question.\n5. Option D can be eliminated since \"none of the above\" is an unintelligible answer for \"A\" question that asks for comparison.\n6. Finally, both \"carrot\" and \"potatoes\" are cooked and eatable vegetables. They are also used every day in many people's kitchens.\n7. Because of this, they would appear to be the most appropriate answer for the question.\nAnswer: C: potatoes\n\n### Demi Final Questions\n\nInput: Which is better off driving to work, using a vehicle?

Choices: 1: 1999 B: 2000 C: 2002 D: 2005 E: 2010\n\nRationales:\nThe question can be broken down into two parts:\n1. The printing of the book happened in a specific year.\n2. The year in which the book was printed is not a whole number of 1999-2010.\n\nFrom that we get a number of rules and facts about this situation:\n1. There is a list of options: 1990-2010 between 2000 and 2005.\n2. Every option is either the year that the book was printed, or was used to denote a year before or after the book was printed (there are no options for years in the two-numbered range of the 2000\u2019s)\n3. All options have a number in the range of years that were between the year that the book had been printed to one of the two-optioned years before or after.\n\nNow we can eliminate options that are incorrect: 1998, 2003, 2007, 2012. Why? Because there is no year in which the book has been printed in between the two-numbered years that have these options.\n\nIn summary:\n1. All the options between 2007-2010 will either be the year of publication or the year before or after the year that the book has been published.\n2. There is no year inbetween any of these two-numbered options.\n3. The publication year is in the range 1999 to 2004 and is between 2001-2005. There exists a correct answer and none other.\n4.

{"text": "record is 'destroy history'.\nAnswer: A: burn history\n\nInput: You find people with different opinions, what does this show? Choices:  The answer is not given here\nRationales: The question is presenting a scenario where someone finds people with 'different opinions'.\n1. The scenario is presenting the idea that individuals, who have different opinions, work together.\n2. Given this information, the answers must be a demonstration of this.\n3. An answer may either be an action that demonstrates the idea of two people with different opinions working together, or an action that would be uncommon if two people with different opinions do not work together.\n4. Option A states that it will only be rare if a couple with different opinions don't work together. This is too unspecific and unrelated to the 'finding people with different opinions', so this answer can be eliminated. \n4. Options B and C both refer to people who are already known not to have different opinions than each other, i.e., they would never work with someone with different opinions since they are already together. This further eliminates it since it makes no sense to say they demonstrate working with different opinions since they don't work with such.\n5. Option E doesn't give any action related to the scenario and also doesn't offer any reasoning relevant to the 'finding of people with different opinions'.\n6. Therefore, 'demonstrate working with different people' offers the most sensible explanation of the scenario.\nAnswer: B demonstrates working with different opinions\n\nInput: There was a mistake in the car part, the owner may choose?

If the answer is 'not buy from the dealership', it would make sense if the mistake was intentional since they didn't care about it.\n3.

You must be able to complete the sentence with one or more of the same word/phrase type, and correctly identify the word or phrase group, that you have chosen to apply.\n\nStep 1: Start by determining what the question and the task actually are.\n\nIn this question,  'Fabric is cut to order'\nis the initial clause of the question. \nLet's consider it as an indefinite noun phrase (IN).\n\nIN describes 'fabric', hence, IN is a noun phrase.\n\nThe question also includes the word 'however, which suggests a contrasting comparison or a choice in response. \nLet't consider 'however' as an adverb phrase (AP).\n\nAP describes, in some way, both IN and the rest of the question.  Hence, AP can be determined as an adverb phrase.\n\nNow it's easier to identify what information the question wants. \nThe question is trying to provide a response of the type of seller 'fabric is cut to order\n' can be found in.\n\nTherefore the answer that can correct identify this question's response would have: \nto do with IN, i.e. be a noun phrase and: \nbe contrasting with another element, i.e. AP adverb phrase and:\nbe a response that describes the type of seller wherein fabric is cut to order is found, i.e. the function of AP adverb phrase.\nStep 2b Select the most appropriate response from among the given options (up to half of the correct responses) \n\nOption a would be a correct response, as it is related to IN.\n\nOption b would be a wrong response, as it is not related to IN.\nStep 2c Eliminate wrong answers or incorrect noun phrases from the pool of answers by applying word associations or word knowledge.\n\nOption b,'sewing room' would be eliminated", "answer": "A: being married"}

You will be able to brush your hair, dry your hair, wash your hair, and cut your hair with any of these colors.  3. You can also \"tease\" your hair but that is the only action of the answers that requires physical tools or implements.  4. That's because all other answers just name an action without an implement, e.g. brushing hair, etc.\n5. Since \"tease\" is the only action that isn't obvious from the answer, but the one that requires a tool or implement, then it is the only answer that could possibly be correct. 6. Therefore, the correct answer is E: tease.\n\nAnswer: E: tease\n\nInput: How do you tell a person wants your address? Choices: A: say it B: ask for it C: write it down D: write it E: say it to them\nRationales: The sentence tells us the way an address is shared is by telling someone else your address, writing or saying it.  1. You will only \"tell\" an address if you know it and are communicating it to someone else.  2. All choices contain a verb (telling, asking, writing, and so on).  3. You can \"write\" or say your address to people, but it will not be a way for someone to \"find out if you have an address\" because writing and saying it to someone shows that you have an address.  4. You can \"ask\" it, but it would be asking for a person to give you someone's address.\n5.

Option A ('peaches') is incorrect, as peaches aren't an ingredient used in cobbler.\nStep 3. Option B ('oven') also doesn't make sense, as an oven isn't an ingredients but a tool used to cook or bake food. It doesn't apply to'making peach cobbler'. Option C ('eggplant') doesn't apply either.\nStep 4. Lastly, option D ('cream') is an option that could be an option however it is used to make other types of cobbler's and this 'other' is usually used for cakes and cream puffs which are not types of cobbler and doesn't make sense in context.\n\nStep 7.

Choices:  N: camera B: light bulb C: microphone D: screen E: actor\nRationales: Choice N doesn't specify the camera type so it's irrelevant.\nChoice B doesn't specify the bulb type, either.\nChoice C is incorrect because we are talking about a movie production; a microphone may be used for a recording or to announce a film presentation, but it's not required for a movie.\nChoice D is an incorrect answer because we aren't talking about making a movie to show on TV.\nChoice E is not an actor, but a 'role', and we're not talking about the roles in the movie.

Choices:  A.  better circulation B. C.  a faster heart rate D. a high blood pressure E. a higher body temperature\nRationales: In the question, a person may ask themselves how to have good circulation. This indicates that good circulation is a desirable thing.\n\nOptions A-D all describe physiological states. A person can have a faster heart rate, but they can be at either end of the spectrum, not just the faster end.\nA person can have a high blood pressure, either because they have a lot of pressure, or they don't have very much pressure. A person can have bad circulation, but that may be because their circulation is moving blood from their heart to an infected spot.\n\nAs for option E, a person would probably have a higher body temperature if they were exercising.

Choices: 1. A: hot and wet B: clean and dry C: clean and hard D: new E: old\nRationales: Analysis of the question. The question is asking for an item (new), whose properties could be combined to generate the result.\n\nAnalysis of the alternatives (A, B, C, D). Evaluate each of the choices against the result of the question.\n\n1. A: hot means the item will be very spicy, wet indicates the item will produce liquid. Together, these characteristics could be combined to produce a new item that is very spicy + emits liquid!\n\n2. Combining 'clean' and 'dry' doesn't make sense for a new item since the characteristics indicate two opposite conditions.\n\n3. Combining clean and hard, together, indicates something stiff and unyielding, which describes something old.\n\n4. Combining clean with new is a little trickier, since new could mean having minimal history, but the combination doesn't change the characteristics of clean in any way.\n\n5. With all that said, new combined with clean makes the most sense, as the two characteristics would describe an item with very few characteristics associated with it, which means it could be seen as new.\n\nAnswer: I would combine the phrase 'Clean and new' for the resulting item to meet my goal", "answer": "B: applaud"}

{"text": "record is 'erase'\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: The people were in what position? Choices: 1. A: in jail B: on foot C: running D: in prison E: on stilts\nRationales: First, the question is asking us about the position of the people. It is not what type of people who are in jail on foot and so on.\nNext, we are given options in a row form. We need to interpret them and choose the one that fits in the most.\nSince the question ask about the people were in what position, not how many people we talk about, it means we are supposed to figure out what they were doing.\n1. Choice A: they are probably in prison, but if they were in prison, they aren't in prison at the same time they are in the same position, so this choice is not fitting.\n2. Choice B: because on foot, they are running, so probably they were running away, or they wanted to go far for what they did. So, we can choose them the closest choice to why they were in that position.\n3. Choice C: we can think about their situation. If they tried to run away or to take flight to somewhere else, they need to be on their feet to go anywhere. So maybe they were running from other people, not they were running, they tried to move and they were caught and now they are on foot in which they are running, so they are not in a position they desired.\n4. Choice D: because they are in prison, they probably doing something badly, because they are in a situation like this.\n5. Choice E: we know that when people are in a prison, it is because they did something wrong, and also when people do bad things, they are probably on stilts. So, this one also can't fit.\nTherefore, we pick choice B, which is most like if they wanted to get away or to flee somewhere.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: In the video, she was trying to do what, to avoid people asking her questions?

We can eliminate Capes and Gloves as they are not associated with farm work. Jeans and Leather could potentially be relevant options but they do not explicitly indicate whether or not the farmer is actually wearing them. Similarly, it is unclear if Shorts are worn to feed crops. Therefore, these options can be eliminated. Therefore, the question can be resolved once we decide between D: leather and E: shorts. 2. We look to the question and see that the farmer may be wearing either leather or shorts, so we choose D: leather.\nAnswer: D. leather\n\nInput: If he could only get 7 items, does it matter if they would arrive on time for the train? Choices:\nA: yes\nB: no\nC: yes\nD: no\nE: yes\nRationales: Let's examine each option and evaluate if they can be eliminated as choices:\n1. Option A can be eliminated since it does not take into account if arriving in time for the train. If there were 7 items that did not arrive in time, there would not be a problem as long as the first item has already arrived. 2. Option B also cannot be a suitable answer because this choice assumes that arriving late for the train is enough to disqualify this person from using the service completely without taking into account how many items they could get. 3. Option C can also be eliminated as it suggests that it does not matter if the items arrive late and is the opposite of what this question seeks to answer, so it is not a valid choice. 4.

Choices:  B: soda pop C: coke D: cocktail E: lemon\nRationales: Here, we will examine each choice individually. \n\nExplanation of all the answers that are incorrect: \n\n* Option A: \"soda\" cannot be sweet and sour at once, as soda is either one or the other, with no in-between.\n* Option B: coke sounds like a non-caloric, diet, sweet beverage (like a \"fountain coke\") and not sweet and sour at one time.\n* Option C: there is confusion between \"coke\" (option B) and \"cocktail\" (option D) because of similar wording. This is irrelevant, however, as they are not the same drink.\n* Option D: cocktail is an alcoholic drink and not exactly sweet and sour at no time.\n* Option E: lemon on its own does not have any taste, neither sweet nor sour. You could have lemon juice squeezed of a lemon however, and lemon juice can have sweet and sour flavors while lemon itself as a whole does not have any sour flavor.\n\nRemaining options: The only answer that could be relevant and related from this question is B: soda pop.\nSoda pop can be sweet due to the sweetened syrup in it. \"Sweet\" and \"sour\" might be referring to the sweet and sour flavoring, as in \"sweet\" and \"soured\" as in vinegar, which is also part of this kind of mixture.\n\nAnswer: B: soda pop\nInput: What are the types of foods that are made in the kitchen?

E: train\nRationales: There are two main functions of a handbrake: one is stopping the vehicle, the other is parking the vehicle.\n1. A bike is meant to be used on a level surface, so a handbrake would not be useful for parking. Thus, in a bike, a handbrake would only be needed for stopping. The answer is B: car.\n2. A bus can be used on various road surfaces, so in a bus a handbrake would be used for stopping and parking. Thus, the answer here is A: bus. So, the answer is B.\n3. A train moves on parallel straight tracks, with a consistent speed, so it will not need a handbrake for stopping or parking because it will not need to slow down or stop while moving. It will be used for stopping to pick up and drop off people or to have the vehicle stopped. So, the answer here is E: train.

Choices:  V: a bath A: a bus B: the lid C: dog hair D: something stolen\nRationales: The question asks who one would want to be around at a time when one would have the item sitting at the bottom of a shoe. \n1. To assess each option and get a better understanding of the intended meaning, here are the possible meanings of the phrases.\n2. 'V a bath', 'A a bus', 'C dog hair', and 'D something stolen' do not directly lead to the item on the bottom of a shelf.\n3. However, 'V a bath' can mean something good was taken from, 'A a bus' can mean to steal something, 'C dog hair' can mean to clean, and 'D something stollen' can mean to take something away.\n4. These are vague suggestions as to what is on the bottom of the shelf. \n5. So it is better to assume it is something 'good' and a 'bus' as this is what makes the most logical sense in context.\n6. So the intended meaning would be related to 'A a bus' and 'D something stole', thus the answer is D: something stolen.\nAnswer: D : something stolen\n\nInput: You put on a shirt, why would it be important?

Choices:  D: driving A: teaching E: resting F: listening B: playing \nRationales: The question presents a scenario, asking what the parent is doing in context of a child being placed in the backseat of the car.\n1. The best answer is A, 'teaching'. The question specifies that a child has been placed in the back seat, which indicates that the parent is likely responsible for that action and is driving the car.\n2. The parent is most likely driving the car which would necessitate that they are paying attention to the road, not listening to something.\n2. The only option where a parent may be 'listening' could be 'listening to the child' but this is unlikely, as it seems to be contrary to the action of driving a child around with special attention to safety.\n3. It may be possible that a parent is driving while teaching their child, however, given the description of the scenario including a child being placed in a seat we can rule out that option because driving and teaching does not appear to be simultaneously achievable.\n4. In this scenario, the action of teaching can be interpreted as the parent providing instructions as they drive the car with attention given to making the entire trip as smooth and as safe as possible. \n\nAnswer: D: driving\n\nInput: A man had a car wash, which of these did he use?

As soon as one notices anything unusual, one might do any of these things.\n3. By evaluating each option, the most logical actions are:\n  2. buy - you do this when you notice something for sale and want to buy.\n  3. run - you do this when running away.\n4.

The question uses the word \"promptly\" which indicates that a person felt an emotion due to the speed at which police arrived or due to the presence of police.\n2. Examining each choice, we can see that A: \"good\" means a pleasing emotion, which can also mean positive and neutral.\n3. B: \"better\" can refer to how good, implying a more positive state. \n4.

Choices: \n\nRed\n\nMauve\n\n\nSilver\n\nGreen\nYellow\n\nRationales:\nSteps:\n\nStep 1: Analyse it's asking for the color of the book.\n\nStep 2. Eliminate unreasonable answers\n\nStep 3. Eliminate the ones that require to take knowledge outside the question.\n\nStep 1. What can be eliminated:\n\nAnswers marked red means they can be eliminated right off the bat as they do not provide information required by the question.\n\nAnswers blue means they are reasonable if they are related to the question in some way without being too obvious.\n\nStep 0. Read the Question: (Read the question more than once)\n\nThe student is in front of a book written by a famous American novelist.\n\nStudent is the subject, but they cannot be coloured blue or red. So that leaves mauve, silver, green, and yellow.\n\nStudent is looking at the book, the book has a colour but not a specific colour so anything goes.\n\nSilver is an expensive metal so mansions are almost always made of silver (it's a funny detail) (but irrelevant to the question.\n\nMauve is a colour but I cannot find a famous author of Mauve. It may be a very old author but I cannot find a Mauve author.\n\nStudent is in front of the famous American novelist, so we can eliminate green, yellow, and silver because those colours can be associated with American novelist but they are not required to the question.\nIn general, you cannot tell what colour a book is unless you hold it in your hand, so we cannot eliminate blue.\n\nStep 7. The answer is blue.\n\nComment: Hi, you can always edit your responses if they contain errors, are vague, or don't adequately answer the question.

The most feasible option is rewrite.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: Where is the first place they put on towels? Choices:  The A: sink B: linen closet C: bedside D: bathroom E: laundry chute\nRationales: Question requires us to interpret the question.\n1. The question asks \nwhere people place towels.\n2. Consider the available options where people can place their towels and eliminate any option not related to the question or that does not fit in the criteria specified above.\n3. 'The A: sink' has nothing to do with the question.\n4. 'Linen closet', 'bedside' and 'bathroom' seem to be related to the question but they also do not match the criteria fully. For example, 'bedside' is too specific (people do not necessarily keep all of their towels on the bedside, a subset of the towel set).\n5. 'Linen closets' is also specific, and may not be applicable to all houses. \n6. However, it can be seen that 'the bathroom' is the suitable and appropriate answer. This is because bathroom is a place to keep towels and also, most houses have bathrooms. So, it fits the given scenario and the criteria of the question perfectly and can be selected as the answer.\nAnswer: E: bathroom\n\nInput: What will keep a place cold? Choices:  Clothes A: air B: fridge C: heater D: water \nRationales: In this question, we need to comprehend the given data to identify the correct answer. A key aspect is our understanding of the words.\nThis question asks us to identify 'a place' that keeps the place 'cold'.\n\nWe can now eliminate option A, A: 'clothes'. Clothes by themselves are not a place and also cannot keep 'cold'. Thus, option A is eliminated. Similarly, option B, option B: 'fridge', C 'heater' and D 'water' is not a place and cannot keep a place 'cold'. So, all these options are eliminated.", "answer": "C: pantry"}

Choices: 1: Turtles may not be smart enough to realize the risk they face as they are trying to avoid bigger fish.\n2: Fish below the turtle could bite the turtle.\n3: Above the turtle is where sharks live and they may bite the turtles head 4: Turtles do not have legs and they are at risk if they reach an area where they will not be able to swim faster 5: They will drown as their backs are too heavy and they have problems with buoyancy\n\nRationales: A: 1 and 2 do not apply as it is unlikely that a turtle would not know that moving above the water is a threat.\n\nB: the turtles face is likely too big to be eaten by fish below the turtle making option B: unlikely.\n\nC: option C: could be right as sharks do live in rivers.\n\nD: if your turtle is big enough it is able to swim and move fast through the water.\n\nAnswer: D: If it is big enough, it has both problems to move fast enough because of their bodies.\n\nInput: I use a credit card so that I can pay online.

Option A: Vacuum cleaners are used to clean the floors or rugs, they help to remove dust and dirt from the area, a broom cannot do this so, eliminating it. 2. Option B: A broom can be used to clean the floor or the area, which makes it one of the options, however, in a house, we wouldn't use a broom to clean the whole house, it would be used to clean certain areas. 3. Option C: Dust pan is a great choice, as it is used to remove small items, dirt, dust, and crumbs from the floor or floor rug. 4.Option D: We use rakes in gardens or for moving hay, leaves, dirt, vegetables, or branches. 5.Option E: Option E doesn't make enough sense to clean the whole house.\n\nAnswer: It would be safest to select \"D\", since only \"Dust Pan\" has enough relevance to \"clean the whole house\"\n\nInput: What kind of place might a man buy furniture?

For each letter given within a sentence, consider the context of the sentence and identify to which of the possible choices it can relate to. In this way, each of the given letters can be evaluated and categorized.\n2. The phrase \"two or three\" indicates that there should be at least two and up to three letters.\n3. Option A: Letters are often written separately as a group of letters rather than a single word. \n4. Option B: There can be several words in a sentence and they could be placed together in a way that forms a new word or meaning. But, the option provided is \"words and phrases\" which includes individual sentences which could be considered as a unit or a group.\n5. Option C: The word \"sentence\" implies that there should be a starting and ending point with at least 16 characters in between. But there shouldn't be a specific number of words or sentences.\n6. Hence, options A, B, and C are incorrect. \n7. Option D: In this sentence, the word \"titles\" is mentioned twice. Also, the sentence is in simple form and contains at least a title.

The question is using context to ask about a place or a country which has a title \"boring\" or \"unexciting\" associated with its name.\n3. Option E, Canada, can be eliminated because it mentions how life in that country is \"boring\".\n4.

Start by considering the given options of what you can access with your phone when you have the internet, the website, the library, television, and printer.\n2. It\u2019s best to eliminate any that don\u2019t actually sound possible. For example, the internet and the television are two different platforms.

E: trout\nRationales: The question has provided a clue, 'fish the most', as well as a situation where a cat is fishing, but has omitted some information regarding these fish.\n\nStep 1: Analyse the choices.\n\na. Choice 1 is for ocean. There is no indication that the fish is of any relevance to the situation.\n\nb. Choice 2 is for swimming. Similarly, there is no relevance to this in the given situation.\n\nc. Choice 3 implies 'bass', which is a type of fish.\n\nStep. 2: This option is the only sensible one, but is not exactly a correct one.\n\nThere is no need to specify that the fish is a member of the bass family, so the choice could just be 'bass'.\n\nStep 3. The most suitable option is, therefore, c, bass.\n\nAnswer: C: bass\n\nInput: They lost the game with the score 62. What type of game?

Whenever\nRationales:1. What do the given options have in common with 'homework'?\n\n2. First, look at Choice A, i.e. \"At night\". This is likely not an acceptable answer because night-time homework tends to imply a more advanced stage of school and high-school students, especially college students tend to do their homework at night.\n\n3. Second, Choice B, 'At lunch' has nothing to do with homework and even if we say at the end of lunch break, this is only if homework is a part of the school curriculum and a regular practice and some schools do assign homework during the lunch break as a strategy to have students concentrate on homework.\n\n4. Choice C, 'At morning' is only partially apt. Most children do their homework at school and then again at home, typically after supper around evening.\n\n5. Choice D, 'At day end' is also not the correct answer to the question. Homework is assigned at the beginning of school and typically submitted at the end of the school day.\n\n6. Choice E,'Whenever', is also not the correct option because whatever you do you assign yourself homework at various intervals and there are many ways to define 'Whenever'. \n\n7. Therefore, there is only one option that fits all of the constraints, is aptly and specifically associated with homework. So, A, 'At night', is the most suitable option.\nAnswer: A, At night.\n\nInput: Who did I write the exam for: The student or myself?

D: Eat the bag of potatoes and the box of cornmea 5. E: Eat the box of cornmeals on its own\nRationales: First let's eliminate some options because these don't make any sense. \n\nEliminate Option A: This option asks if one should use this bag of potatoes and box of cornmeal. However, this is not the context of the question. It wouldn't make any sense to use them if you don't have potato chops or cornflakes. \n\nEvaluate Option B: The context suggests that these potatoes and cornmeal are meant to be used, but keeping them in a bag for the future would be beneficial as they are not supposed to be eaten immediately. So this is a suitable option. \n\nEnumerate Options C and D, then eliminate option C: So, using just these two options, which are better choices? Well, if you are supposed to eat only a bag of potatoes but have some cornmeal as well, then you should better use the cornmeal along with potatoes. This is clearly a more logical and logical use of these ingredients. This eliminates option C. \n\nNow we are left with B and D, and only one of them is better in our context and that is Option B, which is to keep the bag while using the box of cornmeasures. \nAnswer: B - Keep the bag\n\n**Re-evaluate the answer provided by the application:**\n\n- Answer is correct.\n- Recommended wording is reasonable.", "answer": "E: menu"}

'Patient' people are likely to save money and think more carefully about things so would be more economical with their money. Therefore, 'patient' is the best answer for the given sentence.\nAnswer: C: patient\n\nInput: What might be done by a company to reduce inefficiency among employees? Choices:  a. Lay off some workers\nb. Raise pay\nc. Remove supervisors\nd. Promote workers\ne. Offer training courses\nRationales: After analyzing each of the choices, we find that a company may fire workers that are not efficiently performing their jobs, so 'lay off' is a possible answer.\n\nRemoving the supervisor could potentially improve efficiency by giving more control to employees for taking independent action.\n\nHowever, the 'raise pay' option is only partially accurate; a company does not have to offer workers a raise to increase their efficiency. Instead, they can offer workers training courses.\n\nRemoving supervisors and promoting workers are definitely not the correct solutions as these do not increase efficiency alone.\n\nTherefore, the best answer that matches the context is 'training course'.\nAnswer: D, Promote workers\n\nInput: What do you usually put on your shelf that you did not expect to put on your shelf?

{"text": "record is 'trying to erase history'.\nAnswer: C : trying to erase history\n\nInput: What must they not do during the process of filling out a tax form? Choices:  C: put their social security number B: ignore their spouse A: take too long D: have no knowledge of the situation E: include their dog's name for their address\nRationales: The question asks about the actions one must avoid during the process of filling in a federal tax form. \n\nAnalysis options:\n\n1. As indicated in the question, the answer must include items that are prohibited during tax form filling.\n2. 'C: put their social security' number is not an action to avoid, it should probably be included in the action of filling out the tax form.\n3. 'ignore their spouse' may be relevant in the process of filling out tax forms, it is only indirectly related to tax forms though and not the main action.\n4. 'take too long' is not related to filling out tax forms and may be too broad compared to the question which is focused specifically on federal tax filings.\n5. 'Have no knowledge of the situation' is a broad statement, perhaps someone didn't pay attention or forgot the details of filling out their tax forms. However, it's not an action you aren't supposed to perform, hence doesn't match the intended meaning and is dismissed.\n6. 'Including the dog's name for the address' is an outlandish action and would raise eyebrows in filing forms, making it unlikely to be a valid action to avoid.\n7. Based on the analysis, C: put their social secuirty number is the best choice as it is a direct answer related to the action of filling out a federal tax form.\nAnswer: B, C: put their Social Security number\n\nInput: Who can be identified in the process of planning a party? 4. Choices:  A. a hostess, inviting people, deciding the decoration  B. the invitations, the guests, the refreshments C. the decorations, the guests, the hostess D. the host, the guests, the decorations  E. the friends, the host, the invitations\nRationale:  The question asks about people or items relating to planning a party.\n\nAnalysis options", "answer": "A: good health"}

Choices: 900, 902, 999, 2400 2502\nRationales: Analysis: We are given the number 992, and asked how it is written.\n\n\n1. We can eliminate choice 900 because 992 = 900 + 92. \n\n2. Choice 902 is also incorrect because 992 > 902.\n\n3. For choice 999, it does not match our input number.\n\n4. We can eliminate choice for 2400 because 900 + (92 +2) = 992.\n\n5. We can eliminate choice of 2502 because they are too far apart in number.\n\n6. Therefore the final answer is 992 =900+92.\n\nAnswer: D. 900+9.02\n\nInput: You get pink roses, how do you use them? Choices: A: in a flower shop B: to make a table C: to have a party D: to have decorations E: for a funeral\nRationales: The question gives a clue 'You get' and ask how one uses it.\n2. Consider each of the options and determine which choice is the most closely related to the usage of pink roses.\n3. Based on the given options, we can eliminate:\n\n(a) option A: A flower shop is selling pink roses. It is obvious that this option does not relate to how you use pink roses. \n4. (b) option B: A table is made from many objects, including pink roses. We can eliminate this option as it is unrelated.\n5. (c) option C: Pink roses are used during a party. While this choice could relate to this concept, 'a party' is too general. Therefore, it can be eliminated altogether.\n6. Option (d) is 'to have a", "answer": "D: amusement park"}

Choices:  C: kill the mouse A: jump over the chair B: play with toy mice E: eat the mice C: play with the ball\nRationales: The question is presenting a scenario that is most naturally associated with the verb 'wants to do'.\n1. The word 'ball' could be related to options A, B, and C as these choices involve the ball in some way and there could be a connection.\n2. But the ball in the context is something that the cat is trying to get or play with.\n3. The choices don't represent this concept as the word 'ball' is used in different terms in each one. A ball is an object (B), a piece of furniture/furnishings piece (A), and a group of small animals (C); none of them relates to the scenario of the cat trying to get a ball to play with.\n4. Considering these options, we can understand that all of them do not relate to the meaning presented in the question.\n5. The choices that are the most relevant to the meaning of the question are C, play with the ball.\nAnswer: B. play with the ball\n\nInput: What was your reaction when the teacher said the book was banned? Choices:  B: disappointment C: relief E: anger B: disappointment\nRationales: This question tests how we can accurately identify an emotion that a person likely felt when something happened to them.\n1. By analyzing the given information in this context, we can determine that the person is probably experiencing sadness when the teacher announces the book is banned.\n2. The choice that is most closely associated with the emotion of \"disappointment\" is option C, \"relief\". \n3. Disappointment generally refers to feeling sad about or being unhappy with something. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\nAnswer: D. sadness\n\nInput: What should someone do if they hear there was an accident on the mountain?

Choices: \n\nA: jug B: glass C: cup or mug\n\nRationales: By analyzing the possible choices of the question, we can see that a jug is the best possible answer.\n1. \"Jug\" is the only answer that fits in both contextual and semantic terms, and the only choice whose meaning seems to fit the question's context.\n2. \"Glass\" and \"cup or mug\" make no sense as replacements for a sink and have very different meanings from the question itself.\n3. They also do not fit well in the question's context, which focuses on using a sink to drink water (and storing the water elsewhere).\n4. \"Jug\" means a large, round container for water \u2014 which seems to be the answer the question is asking for.\nInput: When you're learning to play guitar, which instrument do you start to play? Choices: A: guitar; B: violin; C: bass guitar; D: piano; E: drums\n\nBy analyzing the choices, there is only one correct answer, C: bass guitar. This is the best, most literal option given the rest of the statements. For instance, option A: guitar refers to one type of guitar.\nOption  B: violin is a string instrument that's not related to the bass guitar.\nOption D: piano is a keyboard instrument (not necessarily related to the bass guitar).\nOption E: drum has less relation (maybe even none) to the bass guitar.The rest of the options are not suitable for playing the bass guitar.\nAnother way of evaluating the choices would be to figure out what is the most popular instrument to learn at first, and then cross off the other choices.\nFor example, option C: bass guitar is the most common instrument to start playing (based on the information given).\n\nInput: If a person is playing a violin, where does the player sit?

Therefore, they are trying to eliminate some part of history by erasing past records.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: Where did they probably be driving a car? Choices:  C: city D: offroad E: country F: pavement\nRationales: Analyze the first part of the question to identify who is \"driving a car\".\n\nStep 2. Examine each of these options as to which would the person probably be driving at.\n\nStep 1: 'Offroad' is best as most cars won't be needed for this kind of environment.\n\nStep 2 : 'City' indicates a car might be needed, but the surroundings don't fit where the person can be driving a car so this is the wrong choice. The road type is not specified, so it could be city or countryside roads, 'city' is most likely to be correct.\n\nStep 7 Examine 'Country' which might be the case, but 'Countryside' is more applicable.\n\nStep 9' Countryside' is most appropriate as it denotes a scenic or peaceful space, whereas 'country' does not indicate any roads. City roads (Option D), 'offroad' (Option C), or 'pavement' (Option E) does not give any sense that person is traveling outdoors.\nStep 11 'Countrysite' is incorrect because it doesn't show why the person might be driving. It doesn't tell us why they are driving 'a car'\nStep 1. 'City' might be incorrect because it doesn' t show why the person migt be driving a car. It doesn't explain why they are driving a car.\nStep 12 Country roads are a more appropriate road type than streets.\nStep 13 'City' might be correct, although the question doesn't tell us that the car is driving in a city.\nStep 14 'Pavement' is the least suitable option because the surface of the road is unknown and it doesn't show that it is a road.\n\nStep: 16 Pavement can be replaced by 'road' or'street'. 'Pavement' and 'off-road' both can apply because the location isn't", "answer": "C: argument"}
{"text": "record would be B: tape and E: erase.\n7. So, answer D: play music cannot be the correct option here as it is not what you can do with an \"record\" per se.\n8. 'Erasing' and 'burning' are similar acts, and are also applicable to a physical medium such as a tape, so we can eliminate choice B: tape based on the question's phrasing of 'burning a record'.\n9. Similarly, 'playing music' is an act of using a medium to hear music. \n10. So, choice C: rewrite cannot be an option as it is not related to the act of burning.\n11. Therefore, the only possible answer could be E: erase. Since both this choice and B: tape refer to the act of physically obstructing or removing a certain part of history, erasing is the best answer here.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: Which of these is not a place where one can write down the time? Choices: 1. A: office 2. B: phone 3. C: desk 4. D: wall 5. E: newspaper\nRationales: The question asked for which of the given options are not places where you can record the time.\n\n1. Office: Offices usually have clocks, not writing boards, so this answer cannot be a place for recording time.\n\n2. Phone: Phone cannot be used to record time in that sense. While it may have alarms that tell time, it is not commonly used to record anything.\n\n3. Desk: Desk is another common object to have clocks and alarms on and is likely somewhere one would record the time.\n  4. Wall: Wall clocks may also be used to record time.\n  5. Newspaper: This newspaper option may not seem out of place as one could potentially write down the time on the front page, but newspaper is not a place to simply record the time, rather, read the entire newspaper.\n  \nHence, the correct answer is D: Wall. It is likely one would write down the time on a wall clock, but that\u2019s rarely the only purpose of the clock. \n\nAnswer: D: Wall", "answer": "A: front door"}
{"text": "record is 'destroy' which means to destroy or wipe out something completely.\nAnswer: B, destroy\n\nInput: What can you use to measure time when clocks are not working? Choices: 1. A and B 2. A and C 3. A and D 4. B and C 5. B and D 6. C and D\nRationales: Considering how the question is worded we can analyze each choice in a way such that the choice of answer A and answer B, as well as the choice of answer A, B and C together, answer A and B, as well as answer A, B and D together, answer A and C and answer A, B and the rest.\n1. This is a simple comparison. As an alternative to using a digital watch when a clock is not working, we can use an analog watch. Analog watches do not store data like digital watches, but do keep track of the amount of time pass by a process called'mechanical timekeeping'. Considering that clocks are not working and need data is a more advanced method of keeping track of the time they are ineffective because they cannot store the current amount of time or a record the past time.\n2. As another form of time measurement, a person could utilize the sun and the movement of the sun. In case a clock is broken a person could use the sun to check if it is morning or night. The sun's position is the time of day or night by definition. This is analogous to a digital timer that keeps track of the time using the sun as a pointer, with the sun moving from east to west throughout the day (or from north to south during the winter in the northern hemisphere).\n3. In a situation where digital watches are off, clocks are broken, and the sun cannot be used, a person could create a clock of their own by utilizing the movement of the moon. This is analogous for a person who could estimate the time of day by the moon's position at nighttime and the sun's position in the morning time.\n4. As an alternative to the sun, a person could alternatively try to compare the time to other objects, such as birds, that utilize the sun as a method to estimate time. For example, a bird's internal body clock could help a person understand how early it is and how late it is", "answer": "B: irritation"}

Choices: 1, A: store 2, B: supermarket 3, C: farmers market 4, D: street D.L. 5, E: fast food chain 6, F: cafe 7, G: park\nRationales: In this question, they go to eat at a particular location. So, we have to understand which one of the given locations most matches this context.\n\nFor this, we can start by eliminating each given location based on our understanding if the location fits or not.\n\nStep 1: Let's start by eliminating option D. Street D.L. is a location, not a place to eat.\n\nStep 2A: Option E refers to the place fast food chains are located. However, the question is asking about someone who needs to eat.\nThey may want to eat at a fast food chain if they're hungry, but this is not what they're searching for.\n\nStep 7C: We can eliminate option G after eliminating B and E.\nPark is only a place for outdoor meals, but not the desired indoor dining experience.\n\nStep 9F: Option F is a caf\u00e9, and the phrase is not about searching for the desired location to eat.\n\nThen, we can start looking for the remaining options and their correlation to the phrase 'where they go when they want/need to eat'.\nStep 10A: The word 'go to eat' can be correlated to the idea of \"going to a place to eat\".\nSo, the remaining options which is correlated to places where people eat are 1 and 2.

For example, the person doesn't want to clean up the dog hair.\n\nIn order to determine the correct answer, you need to consider what needs to be done instead.\n\nSince the person doesn't care about keeping the dog hair instead it should be removed.\n\nChoices A, B, C and D, are all ways of removing dog hair. \n\nE is not really an option since the person doesn't seem to care about the dog hair.\nIt is not clear how vacuuming hair is different from cleaning up hair.\nTherefore answer D: Let it shed.\nAnswer: D.

B: replaces all failed parts 3. C: recalls the car 4. D: reworks the car 5. E: scraps the car\nRationales 1.  Start by analyzing each choice and considering how they're related to a car manufacturer based on the scenario:\n2. The first option, A:'sends the failed parts to repair shop'.\n3. This is out of the scope of the question as it doesn't answer what the car manufacturer does.\n4. The second option, B:'replaces all failed parts. Like the previous choice, this isn't relevant to the manufacturer of a car.\n5. The third choice, C:'recalls the car', this is a logical choice but it isn't the best option. Recalls usually involve fixing a car rather than replacing it for good.\n6. In this case, the company would want to determine whether the replacement parts can fix the car (recall) or replace the entire car (scrap). So, a better answer than C: recall is D: recall and replace.\n7. 'Repairing' and'reworking' are too ambiguous and wouldn't be an issue for a car manufacturer.\n8. E:'scraps the car' is a good option as car manufacturers can send out old cars they no longer sell.\nAnswer: D. Scrap and Recall\n\nInput: Which choice is the most likely to make someone happier?

Here we have a series of choices, each offering a viable explanation of what the group could have done. First we must understand what type of action it is.\n\n2. The phrase 'do something' typically refers to an event or occurrence that indicates there is or was a physical act that took place.\n\n3. The phrase could also refer to the idea of what 'could have done' if there was no event, no action that took place.\n4. Analyzing the specific words and phrases in the question, such as 'new ways' it could be inferring that the action was the doing of something.\n\n5. Then, we can eliminate choices 'E' or'meet for classes, because'meet for classes' is not an event or action\n\n6. We may then discard choice 'E', because it is an implied action with'meet for something'.\n\n7. Moving further down we can eliminate 'go shopping' as it is neither an actual event of occurrence nor a potential non event.\n\n8. Lastly, we can rule out the choice 'do research' as it is an action but in the context of this question does not seem relevant. \n\n9. The first and only answer that could have been done at this location is 'talk about new ways'. This matches the most contextual phrases to the question, 'new ways'.

By evaluating the choices, this could be a book, author, biography, letter, memoir, or poetry collection.\n\nStep 1: C: books is a reasonable choice given the context of books as the object authors write about. \n\nStep2: Let's eliminate D: authors as the author writing about the author may be problematic. \n\nStep3: Both F: letter and memoir could possibly be a written account created by the author and written down by the author, which makes them a potential correct answer. \n\nStep4: In context, writing about one's own life and telling their story is similar to writing one's autobiography, which can be considered a type of biography. \n\nStep5: We are left with F: letter, memoir, G: memoir, F: letters and H: poetry collection. However, F: letter and memo could be written about an individual, G: memoir and possibly F: letters, which is acceptable if this isn't the author's autobiography. \n\nNow we can eliminate H: poetry collection since it was never mentioned that the author is a poet. \n\nFinal Answer: C1: books and F2: letters\n\nInput: What can you say that is a negative remark or good point? Choices:  D: critical comment B: positive statement A: negative review E: no remark F: praise\nRationales: Answer 1: A.

Choices: 2: A: fishing bate B: dog trap C: bear trap D: squirrel trap\nRationales: Fishing bait would catch a fish but it wouldn't normally take a trap. A dog trap is more suited for small animals that are less likely to take a larger trap. A bear trap is too large and complex for small animals like squirrels and it would kill one if put on it. A squirrel trap is more suited to catch one in a cage with a handle on its top.\n\nAnswer: B or C: Fishing bait is only used as bait for a fishing rod. A dog trap is used to catch dogs.\n\nInput: What did you use when you needed to stop the pigeons from flying?

Choices: \nA: throw it B: touch it\nC: knock it D: swing\nE: throw\nRationales: The question asks what the hitter is doing before throwing in a baseball game.\nThe hitter typically prepares before their throw, there are various ways to prepare for a throw. These can be physical, mental, emotional, or all 3.\n\nWe can rule out E: throw, as this does not add any additional information about the role of touching in baseball. This indicates that answer choice A: throw is likely an incorrect answer choice, as it does not offer any new information regarding a hitter throwing a baseball.\n\nWe consider choice B: touch the ball, if the hitter is hitting a pitched baseball, then they may not touch the ball again after they hit it. If they want to throw it (in a game), they must have already touched it once to hit it.\n\nWe consider B: knock, if the hitter knocks the ball with the pitcher, then they must already have touched it.\n\nChoice C: swing, if the hitter swings a ball they used to prepare, then we know it was not already touched previously. Therefore C: swing is likely the answer because it provides additional information about the hitter preparing to throw the ball.\n\nAnswer: D: swing\n\nInput: If the person had a friend that has some knowledge of theater, who are likely to go see?

Choices:  Archaeology 101 B Archaeological Artifacts C Ancient History D Classical Geology E Ancient History\nRationales: In this multiple choice question, the intended answer is the correct answer or something very similar to it as the intent is to identify a choice that would seem strange to the learner. \n1. In context, we can reason that 'archaeology 102' does not make sense for the question because it is an advanced course.\n2. 'Archaeological artifacts' are not taught in any course we have ever come across, rather these are artifacts that may be discovered during an excavation.\n3. 'Ancient history' is already being taught in the course.\n4. 'Classical geology' is not relevant to the context either. \n5. Therefore, the best choice answer is E 'Ancient History', since we can determine that this is being taught in the course and it is quite likely to be the course of focus.\nAnswer: E: Ancient History\n\nInput: If you have 5 friends and you give them 5 hats each, how do you make sure 1 hats for each person remain? Choices: A: Give 6 B: Give 4 C: Take 3 D: Take 2 E: All of the options are correct\nRationales: There are two major steps in this question. First, we have to find a solution to the problem. \nSecond, when we have the solution, we have to select the option that is the best description of the problem and solution. \nOption A, giving 6 hats, obviously does not satisfy the requirement as we need to keep 1 for each friend. Hence, choice A is incorrect.\nOption B can be eliminated since it gives 4 hats in total which is not sufficient.\nThe third option can be considered because we can't take hats back.\nHowever, we cannot take more than 3 hats because that increases the quantity of hats to 12 and we still need to keep 1 hats per person.\nAnd therefore, choice D is not the correct answer because of elimination.\nSimilarly, we cannot select choice C which gives 3", "answer": "C: table"}

Choices: 1. B: go swimming 2. C: hiking 3. D: travel 4. E: play video games\nRationales: Actions and tasks are often associated with the purpose or motive behind them. If a person goes swimming, they gain experience in swimming which can improve their swimming skill. If they travel, they gain experience in navigating different ways, which is not useful for their sense of direction.\nIf actions of hiking and going shopping were good for making people lose their sense of\ndirection, one could find many people who hiked and walked frequently to overcome their weakness of direction. Also, one could look for a study of the impact of hiking on improving direction, but there aren't any studies that have examined the effects of hiking or shopping on direction sense.\n\nTherefore, option D is best as it states 'travel', which has a purpose or reason that is most similar to 'losing sense of direction'.\nAnswer: D: travel\n\nInput: How frequently can a person have itch when they don't have any insect on their body? Choices:  Choices: 1  A: never B: very often 2 C: sometimes D: sometimes E: never\nRationales: Different people's body temperatures and skin types vary in itchiness. The most common cause of itchiness in humans is fungal growth on human skin. Insects often don't cause itching, in terms of itching frequency.\nThis question asks how frequent a person's itch would be without insects. The question is asking a general statement, without specific knowledge about a person's specific itchiness, so the answer should be a general statement.\nThe answer would depend on a person's level of itchiness that would occur even without any insects present. Since there is no information regarding how often a person might itch or what type of itchness might be the most common in this scenario, the answer is", "answer": "A: water cooler"}

Choices: 1. A: short, 2. B: tall 3. C: average, 4. D: short\nRationales: In the instruction, we can tell that the answer relates to people, so we can group all the choices in this category.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the irrelevant choices:\n\n1. People cannot be short or shortness, they are either tall, average, or neither tall or average as a person and the choices are not describing characteristics of individuals, but categories they fall into.\n2. People cannot be considered short and tall, which means that the other options cannot be used together either.\n3. We already know that people are either tall, average or neither tall nor average, meaning that other alternatives are inevitably irrelevant; for example, short is neither tall nor average, so C answers are eliminated.\n\nNext, we can take advantage of specific information and combine both:\n\nWe can eliminate B because short, average, and tall do not form a set of three options.\nHowever, we can also use this information to eliminate A because we understand that the people to whom they refer must all fall in exactly one of those three categories.\nHence, if B is eliminated, we can also conclude that A is eliminated due to the information provided about B.\n\nConsequently, we are left with two options: 'tall' and 'average', which are the only two types of people.\n\nWe can therefore conclude that the correct answer is B because C refers to B and A refers to B.\nThe next question is: \n\n### Demoniconstration:\nQ #4\n**For your answer to B, the next question is:**\nIn which category would short, average, and average fall on the scale?

Choices:  Choices A: chocolate B: chicken C: hamburger rice and beans D: coffee 2. Rationales Step 1: Identify the action from the given context, in this case 'what did they order?'.\n\nStep 2 : Then, we have to identify an action which is the only logical choice of a rational person in the given situation and circumstances.\n\nStep 1: The given options are 'chocolate', 'chicken', 'rice and beans', 'coffee'. Let's evaluate our choices. 'Chocolate' is a food item so, that might be a possible choice of one who is hungry, but it doesn't necessarily match or follow any causality between context and action.\n\nStep 2A: Then, the person might just order coffee, no other item. This can be ruled out because if that were the case, it wouldn't make sense to include any other option besides 'coffee' in the remaining choices. \n\nStep2B: 'Chicken' could mean different things: as a physical item you can eat, as a kind of food product, or in general as an animal. As 'being hungry' isn't the primary reason and the choice is unspecific, we can eliminate this.\n\nStep2: 'Rice and beans' seems to be a possibility if they were hungry and ordered the first option. However, this makes no sense as you first burn something and then order something you already burned.\n\nStep3: Evaluate 'coffee'.

Choices: !A: ride B: lately C: never D: tomorrow\nRationales: First, let's look at each of the possible answers in turn:!A: ride, B: lately, C: never, and D: tomorrow.\n\nA.!A: ride is a common and logical answer. A soreness to a pony is not likely to affect their ability to ride.\nB.!!B: Lately, however, is not likely a related answer. While a horse can be sore for months, weeks, or days, it seems unlikely this would be associated with pony's ability to ride.\nC. C: never is somewhat possible, but it is not likely. The main implication of soreness is the discomfort, not a limitation.\nD. D: tomorrow is an implausible answer. For one, it is related to the future, which might not reflect the current state of the horse. Secondly, it's more reasonable for a pony to be sore for days, weeks, or months. Not tomorrow, the next day.

Choices:  $: science $: literature $: mathematics $: English. $: all of these\nRationales: To answer this question, let's evaluate each of the option in turn:\n\n$: science is an option related to the literal meaning of the question. This is because there is a child doing something, namely reading, and they're doing it, i.e. reading science, literature, mathematics, English. So, this is the second choice.\n\n$: all of these is also an option related to what is happening in the question. This is a logical answer because the whole of one's reading is what it means by 'now', which is a common phrase meaning in this moment. So this option is plausible.\n\n$: mathematics is not necessarily an appropriate response for now. There may", "answer": "B: anthology"}

D: anniversary 5. E: graduation\nRationales:\n\n1. Start by analyzed. In this case, we have to understand how the alternatives relate to'special day'.\n\n2. We can eliminate 'birthday' and'mother's day' as these are both days relating to the celebration and significance of a specific individual.\n\n3. Next, we can eliminate 'holiday' and 'anniversary'. Holidays and anniversaries are not only days of significance but the entire time periods that they occur within or around the event of significance.\n\n4. Lastly, 'graduation' isn't specifically about'special day'. We can eliminate this option because, unlike a holiday or an anniversary, there's no significance associated with it.\n\nEven though'mom's special day' is grammatically unclear, it describes something quite specific and has the same meaning as'mom's birthday' and is the clearest phrase in the set.\n\nTherefore, a correct answer is A: birthday.\n\nAnswer: A: birthday", "answer": "C: candle"}

It was not at a movie theatre because that was not the location where the person found his lost dog.\nWe have four options left,\n\n5. It was a bakery where the person found his dog after the owner sold it there.\n\n6. It was a restaurant where the person found his found his lost dog. Since the restaurant owner knew that dog and he/she was also very anxious about his/her dog, they called the person whose dog he found to let him know that it was on their restaurant table while he was going.\n\nThe right answer should be 'F: post office' and 'D: restaurant'. The person found his lost dog in a restaurant where he went with his dog and he was not a post office because he didn't know about his dog which was sold in a bakery. The dog's owner was also present on the place which made the person more aware about where his lost dog stayed.\n\nAnswer: D and F\n\nInput: At what would the man be? Choices: \n\n1.

Choices: 1: A: sell 2: B: borrow 3: C: save 4: D: invest 5: E: give\nRationales: This question tests one's logical reasoning skills to determine which statement would best explain the reasoning behind each listed choice.\n\nStep 1: Analyse the choice of'sell' and the meaning/use of 'a lot'. There are several nuances in this scenario which would require one to draw connections and determine conclusions based on given information.\n\nChoices 1 and 2: 'Sell' could be seen in a broad sense as an option one could be likely to take in order to 'profit from', a 'lot' in terms of something of significant value.\n\nStep 2 (A): Does'sell' imply one's intention to gain profit? We could assume that to'sell something' at any price means that one had intentions to profit, which is why the choice of B could be excluded.\n\nSo, the choice of A:'sell' can refer to the intended profit obtained while trading the item.\n\nStep 9 (B): Does 'borrow' refer to 'lent'? We could conclude that it does not as it is not the same word as 'lend'. Therefore, the choice of B: 'borrow' can be eliminated. This implies that the choice of D: 'invest' can only be the option with most relevance given its meaning.\n\nStep 7 (C): Does'save' refer to banking/saving for the future? We could deduce that it does not as the words 'to save','saving', and'saved', would not be used in the context of the question. Thus, the choice of C:'save' can be eliminated as it has no bearing on the provided question. \n\nStep step 11 (D): Does the sentence 'to gain something' refer to profit/value? It does not seem likely that an action of buying would require 'the gain/profit' because buying could be based on other reasons (like necessity). Similarly, the choice of E: 'give' is irrelevant as the question pertained to the action", "answer": "A: birthday party"}

The question is about people who are eating while they are not at home. This is the only place where they can eat because they are not eating in their rooms anymore.\n\n2. The options C and D are not appropriate answers since people can eat at a cafe and a hotel when they are not at home or in their rooms.\n3. B and E are also not appropriate. B is not a food place, and E is not an option.\n\n4. If we consider the options F, G, H, I, and J, we can eliminate them since they contradict their other choices.\n\n5.

Choices:  Hour hand turned counterclockwise A: clock is running B: hands are aligned C: clock is not moving D: clock is stopped E: hands are moving\nRationales: The question presents a clock, and asks to identify whether the clock is running or not.\nWe first need to break down the question into simpler parts, and reconstruct it for a better understanding of the required output. The key to identifying the correct choice is to understand the working of a physical clock.\n\nClock is running: all hands in the clock move round in a regular way. The hand that's farthest from the number 12 will turn clockwise, while the hand that's closest to the number 12 in every 12 times, will turn the counterclockwise.\n\nNow the given choices:\n\nA: The clock is running.\nThis is a correct choice as the hands of a clock move in a regular way, indicating that the clock is running.\n\nB: Hands are aligned.\nIf I align the hour hands of a clock, the clock would stop, meaning the clock stop would be correctly aligned.\n\nC: Clock not moving.\nWhen clock hands move in a regular way it is running. If the hands of a clock are not moving, it indicates the clock is stopped. Therefore, this cannot be the correct option.\n\nD: Clock is stopped.\nIf the clock is stopped, the second hand should stop moving. It is the correct answer.", "answer": "E: medicine cabinet"}

Choices: A: bake B: cool C: flip D: add E: freeze\nRationales: Analysis: In order to answer this question, we should first think about what is needed to make an ice cream cream cake. We can eliminate some options immediately: Baking requires the recipe for making cake, cooking requires heat (unlikely here) and adding can refer to any type of food stuff for ice-cream cake.\n\nNext, we should consider the rest of the options: making cake requires baking, cooling and flipping doesn't really fit the question of what is needed to make ice cream cake.\nSo, we have only two options which involve freezing: making ice cream and freezing.\n\nAnalysis: Making ice cream is what is needed to make the ice cream cake - the options in question ask how you make the kind of ice cream you would use for the ice cream cakes.\n\nRationale: The most appropriate answer is making ice cream, using the process to freeze ice cream.\n\nAnswer: A: making ice cream\n\n### Demosration\nInput: Why are the shoes important? Choices: A shoe can have good traction B because they protect the shoes C can keep them dry D can prevent the rain from getting to the feet E keep the heat of the earth from getting to the feet\n\nRationales: We have to examine the question and the alternatives in order to determine the answer.\n\nThe question asks why shoes are important. Considering all the alternatives, we can exclude all of them as they do not make sense to be part of our answer.\n\nThe fact that shoes provide traction to the feet to prevent falling and to make them stable is not explained well in the options.\n\nThe fact it protects the shoes is the opposite to what we want to ask about, as they are not being asked why they are important.\n\nSimilarly, the fact that shoes keep them protected from wetness is a feature of protective clothing, not of shoes.\n\nFor example, if you had shoes", "answer": "C: breaks to help stop"}

Choices: \n\nA: your earnings were over 3,600. \n\nB: You're trying to claim a business loss.\n\nC: You're trying claim a home office deduction.\n\nD: You want to deduct your state income taxes.\n\nE: You want to declare interest income.\n\nRationales: The question is asking why one would need to fill out a return if they worked overseas and made personal sales. 1. Firstly, it's important to note that income earned from selling items can be taxed even if you worked oversea with a foreign employer. It doesn't matter where you earn your income, in this case, it only matters whether it is taxable or not. 2. We can eliminate A as it only mentions how much money you earn and doesn't really give us an indication of anything else with this. B mentions that you're trying to claim business loss and this doesn't make sense in the context. So we can cross off B as well. C is the opposite of what we're looking for \u2013 you can't claim a home office deductions if you're not claiming any other deductions, so this can be eliminated. 4. D is similar to B, but we know there will also be at least one other deduction, since the question says to declare so we can eliminate D as well. 5. E could be your best bet, but doesn't have any specifics. You could be in the business of selling items, or using something on the return to claim a deduction, but still not declare that income. There are many possibilities and none of them are likely. 6.

Choices:  G: no H: yes C: I: never K: certainly B: L: certainly not\nRationales: First, let's evaluate each option A-K.\n\nWe can eliminate C and K because they are not logical choices, and don't have logical consequences to the actions or phrases that follow them.\n\nWe can also eliminate I, which is an unfamiliar phrase, as well as K, which is a word used to convey an unpleasant truth rather than a question. \n\nB is an obvious contradiction, as a person can't certainly want to hear music in school, and so it is unlikely that most people want to hear music when they go to school. \n\nThus, we rule out B, I, and K.\n\nThat leaves us with remaining choices, H, J, and L.\n\nWe can reject H because in context, it implies that the individual in the question has been previously learning music and, therefore, wishes to learn it again.\n\nWe can similarly reject J because of its unclear context and logic.\n\nThat leaves only H and L as logical options.\n\nOf these, L is a negative formulation and J is a false choice, leaving us with only H, meaning the person would listen to music when they go to.\n\nThat leaves Answer H, listening to music.\n\nAnswer: H: listening to music\n\nInput: What can you do with a pen?

However, only four are viable, as some require items that may not be available, or a person who may not have time to get them. These include A, for obtaining a broom, and C, for closing the doors.\n\nThe other options that can be ruled out are:\n\nB: Run through either: This option does not apply to a stuck situation.\n\nD: Close them both and then restart: This does nothing, it just locks the person in a room for the second time.\n\nE: Get a broom: This is just an additional step in the process of getting out. This step could be included in option A.\n\nThe remaining two options:\n\nA: Open one and reenter: This can be rephrased to \"open either one and reenter\", which is logically equivalent to just getting out through one door\n\nC: The last option is to do nothing.

Choices:  We can find A: a health club B: a tennis court C: an activity room D: a basketball court E: a golf range\nRationales: Activity rooms have a large area for physical activity, however an activity room is typically a smaller area within the gym, thus Activity Room is not a fit in this scenario. Tennis, Golf, and Basketball courts do have large areas but they do not necessarily have to be indoor facilities therefore do not fit in the context of the question.

Firstly, we might be hiring somebody to do an individual job or task. This could include simple repairs, painting, or perhaps replacing a light bulb. \n\n2. Secondly, we might be having somebody help us with a larger construction project. That project could be as small as fixing the foundation of a deck or as large as building an entire house.\n\n3. Lastly, we might need to hire a worker to oversee a project. This could include an architect who helps you design the house and the carpenters who help you build it. \n\nIn terms of our given options, the choices are 'carpenter,' 'brick layer,' 'electrician,' 'plumber,' and'masons.'

Grocery store are places that sell food and drink as well, but drinking from a grocery store is not a general or normal practice.\n\n6. Food cart is not a place to buy drinks; it is a means for serving drinks at an event.\n\n7. So the choice of drinks is related to food, rather than what the drinks are typically served in.\n\n8.

{"text": "record is option E, trying to erase.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: Person could be feeling, what was the most likely choice? Choices:  (4 answers) A: happy B: frustrated C: bored D: excited E: disappointed\nRationales: The author of the question is probably interested in the'most likely' feeling of the person, as this type of question is asked from a perspective of a person asking 'what does this person want to feel'.\nFurthermore, considering the given options, we already know that 'person could be feeling' part of the question refers to 'bad mood'. So, we can eliminate certain options on that basis. We can also consider whether they are suitable emotional states, given the perspective of 'what does this person feel'.\n\nFirst, consider whether one of the emotions is likely to be the desired one, given the context of the question. For example, for 'excited', not many people would associate the fact that person is upset with being 'excited'.\n\nSecond, consider whether any emotions could be the antithesis of the negative emotional state that would be the obvious answer to the given question. In the sense, is there a positive 'emotional opposite' to the negative emotional state. Option A, 'happy' is not an emotion that can be interpreted as an 'emotional opposite'.\n\nSimilarly, B, 'frustrated' is also not a possibility, as the emotion of frustrated indicates a struggle or battle and does not equate to being happy.\n\nD, 'excited' is also not an opposite, as the emotion is not typically associated with being upset.\n\nIn that case, the only relevant option would be the emotion that was the opposite.\n\nOption E, 'disappointed' most closely matches the option mentioned above. A person could feel happy when they are disappointed for being unable to get what they hope to attain. \n\nTherefore, the most likely response to the given question is option E, 'disapppointed'.\n\nAnswer: E: disappointed\n\nInput: How many blocks are between 3 and 5?

Each of the choice can be eliminated in this manner:\n\n1. Choice A: 'taste' is about the enjoyment (in a vague and non-specific context) that one gets from food.\n2. Choice B: 'dental bill' is about an expense. This one matches the loss concept because you might be spending money on repairing any effects of the inedible food. \n3.

What's the cause of their divorce? Choices: A. cheating B. money C. unfaithfulness D. affair E. unpleasant wedding\nRationales: A divorce indicates the couple split but doesn't account for the reason. The couple got married, and they have the resources to have a divorce because they can afford it. Therefore, choice B: money doesn't make sense. Therefore, an appropriate response would be:\n\nAnswer: C: unfaithfulness\n\nInput: The store is _______.

Then what should they say? Choices:  a: it's a present for them b: it's a gift for a store c: the gift is for them d: it's a surprise e: it's a prize\nRationales: The question is about what one should say if the shop owner asks, \"What are you looking for?\u201d\n1. Considering the given answer options, we can evaluate each and determine which is correct.\n2. 'A', 'B', and 'D' are unrelated to the question as none has anything to do with gifts or giving presents.\n3. 'C' is somewhat related as it shows ownership over a present. This answer would be correct if it were about a gift for the shop owner.\n4. 'E' doesn't seem relevant as a gift is usually rewarding someone and a prize is not given to the receiver.\n5. This leaves us with 'B' which is most closely related as it shows ownership of a present. This is the correct answer. The word \u2018present\u2019 is often seen in relation to gifts and it is this answer which best captures such an intention.\nAnswer: B. present for them\n    \n\n```javascript", "answer": "D: foot"}
{"text": "record would be 'erasing history'.\nAnswer: E: erase\n\nInput: What does the word mimic about? Choices:  D: mimic E: do\n\nRationales: The first step in answering a question of this type is to analyze the given words, in this case the words'mimic' and 'do'. \n\nAn important point to make is that each word refers to a singular action but does not contain any implicit reference to a person, object or other entity (e.g. \"doing\", \"the mimic\", etc.) \n\nNext, we need to use our knowledge of each word to infer what the question asks. \n\nThe definition of the word \"mimic\" in Merriam-Webster's dictionary is \"to attempt to imitate\". The definition of \"do\" in Merriam Webster dictionary is \"to give effect to a plan, intention, or command\". In context, we are also given the information that the word \"does\" is antonymous to \"mimic\". \n\nWith this information, we can infer that the question asks us to differentiate between the words \"mimic\" and \"do\" by finding a word or phrase that means to complete/fulfill the plan/intent. \n\nWith this in mind, \"mimic\" being antonymous to the word \"do\" implies that the two words mean essentially opposite things, further hinting at the meaning of the question. \n\nContinuing our answer, we can further infer that \"mimic\" may refer to an action that attempts to imitate, but does not succeed. On the other hand \"do\" may refer to an effort to finish/complete a task/plan/intention. \n\nWith our reasoning above, we can now narrow our answer options to a choice that says \"mimic\" refers to an incomplete action that tries to imitate (and fails). \n\nThe only option that fits the above definition is the option \"mimic\", as the other three options talk about an action that gives effect to some plan or intention.\nAnswer: D was the best answer.\n\nInput: When someone is looking for a car they like, they may put money into escrow.

Choices:  X: your mom's friend B: your grandma's son A: your friend's mom D: your neighbor X can be: A: friend B: parent C: relative D: stranger E: sibling\nRationales: This question is very similar to the X is Y type question where we have to identify who or what is person Y. It shares a common theme with Y being defined as person Y's friend. In this case, however, the question is asking for person Y who is X's friend. 1. To answer this question, we have to identify the category for X which could possibly be any of the options. Since X can be a parent, relative, friend, stranger, sibling, or X can be 'friend' itself. 2. The best answer choice is Option A, because friend and friend's mom cannot be interchangeably used for x and y, but they both can be used for two different personalities.\n3. Option A is the definition of the word friend. 4. Option B is also a good response choice because friend = friend's mom.\n5. Option C also fits as person is defined as a relative of your friend.\n6. Option D is also a good choice because your friend might be a stranger but the question asks what Y is instead of what is person Y.\n7. Option E is not a choice because it does not make much sense.\nAnswer: A - Your Friend\n\nInput: Who was on the airplane? Choices:  D: man 3.2 kg B: man 20.7 kg C: woman 15 kg E: woman 12.4 kg  Rationales: 1) The question asks about a passenger who was on the airplane, who can include at least one of the given passengers. We can eliminate answers A and B, because the weight for the male passenger is outside of the range of the weight provided in the question.\n2) The passenger could be a woman, hence option E should be considered. Options B and C could be correct answers as well\n3) Based on the information provided in the question, the female passenger option E fits the correct answer, we can deduce that option E is the answer to the question because of the following:", "answer": "A: shelf"}

Analyze the sentence that shows the actions. \nThe following sentence shows the actions: \"Why would we go to a Restaurant with family [in] travel\"? \n2. Examine each of available alternatives. \nThe available alternatives are: \"We could take it [that is, the restaurants] for granted\", and \"We could eat at a Restaurant that is affordable\". \n(Remember that if one option doesn't match to the first available clue \"Why\", then this will be the correct answer!\n\n3. Consider the first alternative: \"We could take [a restaurant] for granted\". \nBased on the phrase use and context of the given question, this alternative is not a suitable answer for this case. \nSince this alternative doesn't fit for both actions and the first alternative, the last option would be the correct answer - the phrase would be \"We could eat at an Restaurant that is [more] affordable\".\nThus, the answer is E: a restaurant that is [more] afforable.\n\nAnswer: E: a restaurant that's [more] affordable", "answer": "E: elevator"}

The choice 'whistle' is the action of producing a sound or tone by breathing through the mouth. It does not necessarily have an associated meaning.\n2. 3: police sirens. This option is a sound produced by a police car or vehicle to announce its arrival. It is part of the police uniform and it is also used during an emergency call or when a police action.

Choices: \n A: are expensive B: can make you gain weight C: cause diarrhea D: can cause indigestion E: give you heartburn\nRationales:\n1. The question is asking about a situation in which a person is thinking of cutting back or giving up eating cheeseburgers.\n2. To figure out the reason behind this, we analyze each of the given options to determine which is most likely.\n3.  Option A is about 'the price of cheeseburgers', which is not a good reason to cut down on eating them as cheeseburgers are sometimes quite cheap.\n4. Option B is about people gaining weight with these kinds of food, but this is a secondary effect that happens as a result of eating more cheeseburges, or consuming lots of calories from them. This could be a valid reason but is not the primary goal. So, this option cannot be the reason.\n5. Options C-E are not related in any way to cutting down on cheeseburgers or giving them up, so these can be eliminated. Thus, the best choice is 'give you heartburn', as this seems to be the more specific reason someone might give cheeseburgers up.\nAnswer: E: give you heart burn\n\nInput: What may be seen in all the houses if its going to rain in the morning and a group of people are going on camp?

Choices: \u2fff A: charge you later \u2fff B: make you pay C: charge you double \u2fff D: apologize E: make you return the item\nRationales: First,  understand the question. The clerk does not take your item. Rather, you take the item with you. Then, you decide not to pay for it. This scenario implies that you might have accidentally taken the item with you and now you must decide what to do. You know it is wrong to take the item and then not pay for it. You are wondering if there could be any forgiveness. There are a few possibilities. The clerk may:\n\nA. Charge you later. This could be in the form of a 'friendly' reminder that you forgot to pay.\n\nB.Make you pay. The clerk could make you pay now.\n\nC. Charge you double. This scenario implies that maybe you are a repeat offender. The clerk could charge you double the price, plus interest.\n\nD. Apologize. Maybe the clerk will feel bad. As you are not a repeat offender, and you forgot on this one occasion, maybe no charges would occur. This is probably the most unlikely scenario.\n\nIf only person B. or C. is correct, then it is possible to choose either of them. Each of these cases has a distinct possibility. D. is the least likely.\n\nE. make you return item is not a possibility (the clerk's job does not make you return the item. Rather, it is yours to do.)\n\nWhat is the most likely case? You've taken the item by accident, and now you've decided to not pay for the item. One of the clerk's options could possibly be to charge you for the item. This is highly unlikely, however. One of the clues is in the question. You are looking for what the clerk would do.

So, this option cannot be the answer.\n\nA hospital is not specifically indicated as an appropriate location.\n\nA home has many different uses, although it's not a location where one might receive treatment for pain specifically.

Choices:  V: play music for kids D: play with band E: play with friends F: play for kids\nRationales: We can eliminate options D, F, and E based on context and their relation to the action taking place (play music). Violins are a type of instrument that can be played to produce music, and can be played in bands as well as independently.\n\nTherefore (since we've narrowed down our choices), we can analyze what each option is trying to convey:\n\nOption V: Play music for kids is grammatically incorrect (one doesn't say 'for' followed by a pronoun in the correct form). Additionally, though, it makes the choice less likely as a play violin for kids would be a person who plays violin for children.\n\nOption D: Play with band can either mean that one plays violin in a band or plays with others who play violin. Since the question is asking something a specific child could do, it is more likely that it means playing with other children. So, while this is a valid option, it isn't relevant to the question. \n\nOption E: 'Play with friends' is out of context. Playing violin is usually an activity done independently/while you're alone.

This kind of question often tests your logical reasoning, and common sense. Answers will most likely be in lists, though not completely accurate nor definitive. As such, if a list of choices is provided for you, you should evaluate each individually, and try to find the one most representative of the entire group.\n2. Consider the list of choices given.\n\n3. Option A: population.\n\n4. Option B: parks.\n\n5. Option C: tourist attracions.\n\n6. Option D: restaurants.\n\n7. Option E: beaches.\n\n8. Populations, parks, and restaurants are all likely to be in cities.\n\n9. However, tbe list does not include the options 'culture' or 'arts'.\n\n10.

Choices:  a: hungry b: full c: satisfied d: tired e: sleepy\nRationales: Each options describe a feeling that is not a result of eating salad, so those can be eliminated. 'hungry' and 'full' are both similar to'satisfied' in that they result from eating and do not describe a feeling resulting from eating salad. 'Tired' and'sleepy' also both describe feelings resulting from being tired. Lastly, 'tired' and'sleep' are adjectives being applied to feelings of hungry, full, tired and sleepy, which makes no sense, thus it can be eliminated too, and the correct choice is'satisfied'.\nAnswer: C. satisfied\n\nInput: The word is out, what kind of personality are you?

{"text": "record is'rewrite'.\n7. Rewrite is generally used to mean altering something.\n8. Options B, D and E are not relevant as an act of burning a record to destroy part of history cannot be done with a tape, music disc or erase option.\n9. Option C, play music, does not really fit as an action, i.e., playing music is not really the act of trying to do something to history.\n10. A tape is a type of music storage, while a compact disc is another type.\n11. Erase is not really a good word for this because erasing is usually done with a computer whereas the term 'burned record' is more associated with the physical destruction of a physical object.\n12. So, the answer is B, rewrite.\n\nAnswer: B: rewrite\n\nInput: In what place is the person probably planning to go for dinner?

There could be a home apartment, restaurant, cake shop, store, dance club, or coffee shop. The options are not definitive.\n\n2. \"Apartment\" does not refer to places you go. When you go to restaurants, cake shops, etc. you usually walk in, order your food, and pay without needing to rent an apartment.\n\n3. The cake shop does not sell homes, a specific home can technically be in a cake shop, but this is not part of the option.\n\n4. \"Dance club\" is not a place you would go to and rent and apartment.\n\n5. \"The store\" is an option that may need further explanation.

The question also states 'after the oven turns off'. The oven turning off indicates that the cooking process is complete.\n\nStep 2a: This means cooking is complete, which rules out 'Cleaning' as the first choice.\n\nStep 9: Choice A (cooking), fits well as a logical outcome of the question's instructions where 'you' will be 'doing' in the kitchen after cooking has been completed.\n\nAnswer: A: cooking\n\nInput: When you are making a sandwich, do you use A: 101 slices B: one slice C: a thousand slices D: seven slices\n\nRationales: Choice A (101 slices) refers to the number of slices used for a sandwich. It can be used because slicing bread is typically done in threes, which is also equivalent to 101. \n\nChoice B (one slice) is less appropriate as we're asking how many slices are used. Using one slice would mean there wouldn't be any left to be used. \n\nChoice C (a thousand slices) is too much and doesn't sound logical to use. \n\nChoice D (seven slices) refers to a sandwich that has a filling of at least three slices.\n\nRationales Part 2: In this particular question, it is essential to know the difference between'slices' and'slices up. Slices refers to the quantity used while slices up refers to the slices that were removed.\n\nThe question then goes on to ask to combine the numbers that remain.\n\nAnswer: D: seven slices E: four thousand three hundred ninety four\n\nInput: Who are you listening to?

{"text": "record is'rewrite'.\n7. Option D gives a different interpretation where destroying history is not the intention and the act of burning history could be interpreted as some ritual.\n8. Option D is unacceptable because the question is asking about what they are trying to do and not what they can do.\n9. The options C and B are neither related to destroying a record or to the question at hand.\n10. Therefore, the answer choice to the question is B: record.\nAnswer: B C: Record, D: erase\n\nInput: Wherever you eat, what do kids usually give away to others? Choices:  X: food Y: napkins Z: forks B: pens C: table ware D: toys E: straws\nRationales: The question gives a statement of a scene involving a restaurant or place to eat, and asks about what children are usually giving away or sharing with others.\n\n1. Option X, food, is something you eat, but doesn't fit the answer as it's rarely given away to others. Kids may want to give others food, but it's usually not practical.\n2. Option Y, napkins, is something given away to clean hands and may be given away to others by kids, but is not usually what is given away.\n\n3. As for options Z, forks, and B, pens, we can confirm both are used to eat food or to write, but neither are things that are typically given away or shared.\n\n4. Option C is correct. Table ware means items used on a table. These items are sometimes shared with others.\n\n5. Option D is incorrect, as toys are often kept or played with by themselves, however, table ware could often be shared. \n\n6. Option E is incorrect because straws are not usually something given out by restraints. \n\nAnswer: C: table ware\n\nInput: The boy is always at home, what did the boy do that made the teacher sad?

{"text": "record is 'erasing'.\n7. So, 'erase' is the correct answer. \nAnswer: E: erase\n\n### Example: In a restaurant which type of worker can you order the food? Choices: A: cook B: waiter C: chef D: server E: patron\nRationales: Each one of the possible options has been given a title that reflects a specific job description.\n1. We can rule out \"cook\" with a quick glance since they are obviously not the one serving food in restaurants. The same principle applies to \"server\" as they aren't tasked with cooking food in general.\n2. \"Waiter\" is often the person who serves food, so the answer could be B: waiter.\n3. \"Chef\" seems to be a likely option for the owner of the restaurant, but it is inaccurate to say the customers would not be able to order food from them to the point that it is not part of their job description.\n4. \"Patron\" doesn't mean they are the owner of the restaurant nor does it mean that they are the ones who serve food. In fact, since the patron can be anyone who happens to enter the bar/restaurant/cafeteria to eat, they wouldn't even have to do their food ordering themselves in that case.\n5. The title \"chef\" is therefore most relevant to a situation where they are the owner of a restaurant. Therefore, \"chef\" is the correct answer. Answer: C: chef\n\n### Example\n\nInput: How do you get the milk in the milk carton? Choices: A) remove the milk B) squeeze the squeeze C) get from the fridge D) make it with milk\nRationales: The options on the list do not necessarily match with the given question.\n\n1. The question asks how one can get the milk from the inside of the carton.\n\n2. We can eliminate options A and C because if we choose to remove the \"milk\" from the carton, obviously that wouldn't make it inside the carton anymore. \n\n3. Similarly, if we choose the option of getting it from the fridge, that doesn't fit the question either.\n\n4. Finally, we will be faced with options B: squeeze", "answer": "E: judge"}

Choices:  Boat A: on the way B: near the coast C: in the ocean D: moving E: traveling\nRationales:\n1. The following question uses a metaphor to describe a boat trip. \nIt asks us to identify a specific location at which a boat starts and ends (i.e. where it departs and returns).\n\n2. In this specific context, a boat could not be'starting or ending' on the way, since 'the way' is an overall route rather than a specific location.\n\n3. When considering the 'coast', it's clear that a boat would'start and finish' at the coast. If it travels to and from the coast without stopping elsewhere first, it is only'starting and ending' at the coast.\n\n4. 'In the ocean' likely means they are out at sea. This means that they are out at sea before and after the destination's coast. \n\n5. Since a boat is an object, it can't simply 'end' on land or 'travel'. \n\n6.

Choices: \tA: 2 times B: 3 times C: 4 times D: 5 times E: 6 times\nRationales:\t1.\tIt can be understood from the question that the quantity of times people press the car's brake is to be determined from the given options.\n\n2.\tA: 2 Times\n\nB: 3 Times\n\nC: 4 Times\n\nD: 5 Times\n\nE: 6 Times\n\n3.\tThe quantity of times a person presses the brake on the car is to be understood as the multiple of the number of times the brake is pressed. For example, if a person wants to stop when there exists a gap of 3 meters, 4 presses are required to cover 3 times the distance, hence 12 meters.\n\n4.\tTherefore, it can be concluded that '3 presses are required to stop after 5 meters,'A: 2 times' does not correspond to the required quantity mentioned in the problem.\n\n5.\tFurther, '4 presses are required after 4 meters', a: '3 times' cannot be the answer because '4 meters' refers to the distance and '4 times' refers to the multiples of the required distance.\n\n6.\tAlso, if '3 presses are in all, 5 meters are required', does not correspond to the quantitative question in the problem, C: 4 times' cannot be the appropriate answer because it involves the word 'all'.\n\n7.\tLastly, it requires '5 times are required after 3 meters.

Choices:  a) spoon B) fork C) table d) fork and spoon D) spoons E) plates\nRationales:  1. First, let us determine which options are the most clearly related to the action of 'eating'.\n2. A spoon, fork, and plate is clearly associated with eating more than other choices like table and plates.\n3. So, these are most likely the most relevant options to the question.\n4. In the context that \"they were eating with a\" indicates that they were \"eating\" and \"it wasn't more healthy\" implies that the food was not \"healthy\" when they were \"eating it\".\n5. Hence, \"why wasn't it more\" indicates that there was some aspect about the food's healthfulness that the speaker wanted to highlight. \n6. The best-suited options are therefore: A: spoon and B: fork, they allow them to focus on the healthfulness aspect.\nAnswer: A and B: spoon and fork", "answer": "D: kind"}
{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: D: erase\n\nInput: What does the person in their room likely need if they need to go to the bathroom? Choices:  C: candles B: hot water D: a sponge E: a shower\nRationales: The question is referring to a scenario where a person needs to use the bathroom and can only go to the bathroom at home, in their room. \n\nWe have to identify what the person needs to successfully go to the bathroom. Considering the given options let's determine which ones best reflect something a person might need to use the bathroom.\n7. 'Bathroom' could be used, but the question is ambiguous if that was supposed to be an acronym instead of an actual noun. 'Bathroom', when analyzing each option, would also not indicate something the person does not have and would only make sense if they were going to the bathroom outside of their room or house, somewhere else.\n\n8. With that discarded, let's analyze the other options.\n9. 'Candles' is a possible answer if you are using a bathroom outside and do not have proper lighting. However, candles are unrelated to the bathroom in this question and the person will already have light once they are inside their room/house.\n\n10. 'A shower' is probably the best answer if you are away from the bathroom and your place does not have a shower or you're using the shower to wash up beforehand if you plan to go to the bathtub. But, we can cross it off if the person already knows the answer because the person would know if they had the shower right in their room or not.\n\n11. 'Hot water' is an option if you are away from your shower at home and the place you are going to the bathroom at only doesn't have hot water in the mix. This is definitely a possibility for traveling though, so cross it off.\n\n12. 'Sponge' can be discarded because if you need a sponge to use the bathroom then you wouldn't go to the bathroom if necessary and would use the sponge on a cleaning task instead, right at the bathroom or elsewhere.\n\n13.

Choices:  C: Unsure B: Unknown D: Many M: All E: Any\nRationales: The question is not asking about how many skills can be hired for, but rather the number of people who can be hired.\n\n1. Because there are two skills involved in the hiring process, each of different number of candidates that can be hired. \n2. Hence, there could be a situation where only one of the candidates can be hired (there are many options, M (for multiple), but none of them apply). \n3. Therefore, since there are multiple options, 'All' (M) is the best answer choice (only option) for the scenario presented in the question.\nAnswer: E: Any\n\nInput: Your job is about transporting items, what other aspect about items could be part of your job? Choices:  B: Weighing C: Making D: Measuring E: Cleaning\nRationales: This question presents a scenario related to transporting items in a job/activity.\n\n1. To answer the question, it is necessary to identify that the transportation of an item is only one of the things that describe a job.\n2. There are other aspects that could be considered to describe the job including weighing, measuring, cleaning, etc.\n3. 'Weighing' matches the description of the possible 'other aspect' since weight is measured via an object's weight. \n4. 'Weighing', though similar, doesn't describe the job, but rather the action of determining the object's weight.\n5. Hence, 'Weighing' is not the appropriate answer. \n6. Similarly, 'Making', 'Measuring' and 'Cleaning' do not necessarily describe the description of the job as their descriptions are too broad and are related to things that can be done in the job but are not necessarily what the job is about. \n7. Therefore, 'Measuring' is not the best answer as it is too broad to describe the job. \n8. 'Weighting' and 'Making' do not match the description provided in the question,", "answer": "A: curiosity"}

Choices: 1: The company did not meet revenue objectives this quarter. 2: They did not complete the reports on time. 3: A coworker sent another employee  a dirty email. 4: They missed the deadlines for completing their work. 5: They didn't meet their sales targets for the quarter. \nRationales:  1. In this question, they use the word angry which means we can rule out answer choices number three and five. Only choices number one, two and four are related to getting angry. Thus, answer choices one, two and four can be eliminated and answer choice three can be eliminated since it is not directly related to getting angry.\n2. This leaves us with the remaining choices: what makes the boss angry?\n3. Answer choice one and answer choice four are about not meeting revenue objectives. They may lead to getting revenue but getting revenue is not getting angry.\n4. Option two is about missing deadlines, and missing deadlines may not necessarily get the boss angry.\n5. Only answer choice two is about not completing reports on time thus, this is the correct choice. \nAnswer:  B: They did not complete their reports on time.\n\nInput: It's a hot summer day, you should not use which? Choices:  Tent  Tent with tent poles  Tent without tent poles  Tents  Tents with tent poles\nRationales: Start by eliminating choices that are unlikely to reflect one's feelings on a \"hot summer day\", such as option E. Choice D is also eliminated because it is unnecessary to provide both tent poles and tent, and since this question is asking to identify the worst choice, having both is unlikely to be preferred. Choices A and B are eliminated because one wouldn't be choosing between these two options unless A is superior to B by some degree, and we're only trying to identify the worst option from the two. Only option C, which is the worst of the remaining options, is left.\nAnswer: Option C, Tent without tent polers\n\nInput: The boy is eating the cake why?", "answer": "E: may die"}
{"text": "record is 'hiding history'.\n7. The options'rewrite', 'compact disc', 'tape', and 'play music' are associated too closely to the physical medium.\n\n8.

Choices: 1: Answers to those questions 2: Answers to the first set of questions 3: Wrong answers 4: The person will not be able to tell 5: Nothing\nRationales: To approach, understand & eliminate each of the following choices.\n1. Answers to those questions:  While the person may have an answer, it's still not known at this stage of the question. This choice should be eliminated first since we want to answer what the person will be able to tell after being asked questions about the food.\n2. Answers to the first questions:  This is also incorrect as the person hasn't been answered any information about the food yet.\n3. Wrong answers:  This also doesn't match with the correct answer option because someone won't be able to tell what will happen after the questions about the food are asked.\n4. The person will not be to tell:  This choice should be eliminataed because 'is going to tell' implies that the person is able to tell right now, not after the questions about the Food have been asked.\n5. Nothing:  This is incorrect because a person definitely won't be able tell after the food questions are asked.\nAnswer: A, B: ANSWERS to the questions about the food\n\nInput: What to know you may not be able to be with your friend? Choices:  You are happy with that, You\u2019re fine with that, You find it upsetting, You accept this You regret it\nRationales: There are three elements to be identified in this question:\n1. \"You are happy with that\" is a statement. Hence, it cannot be an answer and should be eliminated. So, the correct choice among the given choices is \"You\u2019re fine with that\". Since the given choices are statements, eliminate \"You accept this", "answer": "D: soup"}

Choices: 1.a: piano 2.b: violins 3.c: oboes 4.d: clarinets 5.e: guitar\nRationales: The question is asking about the type of instrument that was once used in orchestras. We have to identify if any of the given options best fit this description.\n\n1. 'Piano' and 'cello' might not necessarily be applicable anymore because orchestras have changed since the use of these instruments. But, they can still be correct answers.\n2. We eliminate 'cello' because it isn't an instrument.\n3. 'Oboe' is definitely an instrument that could work for orchestras.\n4. Likewise, 'Clarinet' is an instrument that was used by orchestra.\n5. 'Guitar' is inappropriate because it's not a traditional orchestral instrument. \n6. The options that match the given answer are 'piano' and 'clarinets'.\n7. Therefore: the answer is C and D.

Choices: \tA: self B: other C: neighbor D: friend  E: family\nRationales: The question is using an indirect expression to ask about the answer of an otherwise rhetorical question.\n\n1 The phrase \u201cwhom you will give to\u201d is an expression used to imply a person should answer who they would give something to in an absence of the person first asked.\n\n2 A, and C, refer to a different person.

Choices: 1. A: yes 2. B: no 3. C: definitely 4. D: kind of 5. E: maybe\nRationales: A: Yes and B: No cannot be the answers as the question asks us to choose the best answer.\n\n6 The option C: \u201cDefinitely\u201d is too strong to be the best choice, as the word \u201cDefinitely\u201d does not give a chance for disagreement from any other option.\n\n7 Therefore, it can be eliminated without any hesitation.\n\n8 D and E are both the \u201cmaybe\u201d answers.

{"text": "record is attempting to wipe out or remove a specific aspect of history, such as history textbook, a record in a library, document etc.\n7. This explains why 'erase' and'rewrite' are not a good choice because none of them are related to attempting to remove a specific kind of history.\n8. Another choice, 'play music' is also unnecessary when you consider the fact that burning a record is not about playing music.\n9. Answer: E: erase\n\nInput: What item can get its own chair by a large chair? Choices:  B: dining table A: desk C: bookshelf E: sofa\nRationales: The question is using a metaphor that states a large chair can sit by itself, suggesting that it can stand by itself.\nBecause it stands, it can easily accommodate a smaller item. This item could be the chair's child, a smaller item which may or not necessarily refer to a chair.\nConsidering the provided alternatives, we can start by ruling out the options that are not relevant to the question.\n\nSofa is the only option which doesn't have any relation to the question as it cannot fit the analogy.\n\nA: The desk is a small item and cannot accommodate a chair, let alone a larger chair. In fact, many desks are used for storage as they often cannot accommodate other furniture and are often positioned against a wall for ease of use.\n\nC: The bookshelf may be relevant for the analogy because it is an item that holds other items, but it is not a \"chair\", is too specific to the analogy. The bookshelf could stand for the child that it houses or a \"bookshelf unit\" that could house other items.\n\nE: The sofa is an item that is used for sitting because it is too big when placed on top of desks or other furniture.\n\nThe question mentions only one chair of large size and this implies that it is a single item that cannot have anything \"more\" to sit by it, except for possibly another chair if in a certain set up.\n\nA: Dining table would normally have a chair sit by it, not the other way around.

Choices:  C: steel B: iron A: bronze D: bronze E: brass \nRationales: The question asks about the most difficult kind of shackle to pick and options do not specify what kind is meant.\n1. Of the options, brass is typically not used for shackles as it is not as strong, bronze and steel are more common, so it should be eliminated from contention\n2. Bronze is a possible kind of shackle, so we can eliminate D: bronze\n3. A: bronze is another way of saying bronze, so we can eliminate A: bronze\n4. B: iron is strong, but not as strong as steel\n5. C: steel is more durable than iron so the steel shackle would be more difficult to pick.\nAnswer: C steel\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following true or false statement.\n\n### True or False:\nInput: You can get a headache from a necklace.

Choices:  a: an individual b: people c: person d: one E: what\nRationales: The question is ambiguous at first glance because the options do not include the word 'list'.\n\nStep 1: The first step is analyzing why this question is confusing. There are two things to look at in this case. One is the given answer choices and the second is the word 'list' itself.\n\nStep 2. The answer choices. The question does not include 'list', however, the answer choices are not limited to list specific terms. There are more general terms than 'list'. When we have more options for something, it may seem ambiguous at first.\n\nStep 1. However, 'list' is used in both the given answer choices and 'list' is also a possible answer. One question at a time, we should evaluate the given answer alternatives.\n\nStep 7. Evaluating each answer choice, you will realize that both 'list' is used here, along with the more general term 'one'.\n\nStep 8. Since the specific term 'list' can be considered an option, then the alternatives should not be eliminated as they either include 'list' or a more general term.\n\nStep 9: Finally, it is better to check with a dictionary so that 'on a list is what one is finding is what'.\nIn the above example, a list is on or in a list, it is a word or a line in a list, it does not refer to the term the list stands for when it is an item, so it doesn't mean 'an individual' in this context. Rather 'few' refers to something specific like an item.\nStep 19: Now we can eliminate 'a'.\n\nStep 20: The only choice that can be selected in this context is 'one'.\nAnswer: D only\n\nInput: For which activity do you take a book?

Choices:  C: ask a question D: return an item E: offer a refund F: make a complaint\nRationales: The question is asking about what a seller would do in regards to a purchase. \n\nThe provided choices can be grouped into three categories, with the third category being of two alternatives only. \n1. Group 1: 'C: ask a question', 'D: return an item', and 'F: make a complaint'. \nAsk a question and making a complaint are specific actions that the seller can do. \n\nAlso, return items is a general action that involves a return on a purchase. \n2. Group 2: 'E: offer a refund'. Offering a refund is a generic, or indefinite, action, where it doesn't detail a specific purpose it would be used for. \n\n3. E: offer a refound is a generic, or indeterminate, action, where it does not detail a particular purpose it would be used to.\n\nThe most logical answer must only be from the 2 remaining items, 'C: ask a refund' and 'D: return' - as return and refund are essentially interchangeable in this context. \n\nAnswer: You are trying to identify the seller.\n\nThe most common form of a seller, and the one that is specified in the question, is a store that sells tangible goods.\nThe question says the one who's asking the question is a buyer, and this would make \"the buyer\" the seller. \n\nAnswer (B) - The store is more common and less uncommon.\n\nAnswer (A) - They are not in a place of sale.\n\nAnswer (C) - The questioner is not necessarily the seller.\nAnswer (E) - The question does not specify the nature of purchase.\n\nAnswer: A: The store is more common, store is more uncommon, the question is from the seller, the question is to the seller, the store is most likely.", "answer": "D: spend money"}

Next step, we should choose 1 out of the remaining 4 answer choices, which we feel is most appropriate for the given statement below.\n3. In this case, we have 2 options left, namely: Credit card and Debit card.\n4. Next step: We will choose the option which is suitable for the given statement.\n5. If we remove the statement and the first option (Credit card), we'd just get the remaining answer - Debit card.\n6.

Option A: Subway doesn't travel anyways where there is much livestock.\n3. Option C: Taxi could potentially use it, however it isn't the most frequent means of transportation.\n4. Option B: Car: This is an option that would be most useful in this scenario. In general, cars are a common means of travel in more rural areas or on rural roads where there are larger livestock. They could potentially also be used in cities in more desperate situations, but these aren't usually common or prevalent scenarios.\n5. Option D: Private buses don't typically operate in this manner either, especially when there are a lot of large animals around as a private bus could potentially hit an animal. This is rarely a feature of private buses or other forms of transportation other than options that might be described by A: car or B: car.\n6. Option E: trains are most useful when there aren't as many animals or the train is operated through rural areas or past cities where animals are present, similar to A: car or B, car.\n7.

Turquoise  C. Pink D. Brown E. None of these\nRationales: The question asks for color, and the best color is one they did not wear, but there is no information about one they did wear. We need to get more information in order to correctly answer this question, so let's first analyze each option from the options presented by the question.\n\nOption A: Blue. Blue may be a possible color that the child did not wear. However, blue is also one of the colors they wore.\n\nOption B: Turquoise. Turquoise may be a possible color they wore.\n\n\nOption C: Pink. Pink may be a possible color but more information is needed.\n\nOption D: Brown. Brown may be possible color they did not wear.\n\nOption E: None of the above. The child didn't wear any of these.\n\nWe can get more information out by reconstructing the question. As it's a question, the first part should be 'is' and the second part is a statement about that thing. In our case, the question is 'What the child's color is'. Then you can assume that the other part has to be a counter-example, that is, a color they didn't wear. So, \nOption C is a counter-example, so we can eliminate it right away.\n\nNext we have Option A, \"Blue\", which is a possible counterexample, and we can't tell which or if it is a counterexample because the question doesn't differentiate between a counter-example and a true example.\n\nConsidering that there is no actual information about a color the child didn't wear and neither blue or turquoise can be eliminated, the answer is D, 'None of these'.\nAnswer: D: None of these\n\nInput: You ate peach cobbler and your stomach growled while you were eating it.

Also, traveling alone does not necessarily mean having the time to take a nap. \n\nOption B, 2: One may be too focused on getting home on time that they have to communicate and plan out all the activities to fit in the schedule given but for traveling alone you can always decide your own time, so this is not a drawback to go alone. If one has more time with family members they can always plan to explore the destination and not worry about being late.\n\nOption C, 3: If you are traveling alone then other people do not have to take permission from their parents or someone else which makes things easy as you are only considering the plan. \n\nOption D, 4: It is not recommended to travel alone. This may sound absurd to many but traveling alone may not be the best idea for everyone as alone-traveling may cause feeling lonely, get lost and have a negative impact on the finances as well and it is also not safe to go alone in every destination.\n\nOption E, (blank): This option is not in our choices and not in our premise so this is wrong.\n\nAnswer: B. (Because this option does not require having to plan and communicate with family and friends.) \n\nThe answer can also be (C) because no one had to give permission, which is a drawback while traveling with family.\n\nInput: The people went to the mountains. what is better at", "answer": "B: pennsylvania"}

Choices:  D: fall off bike E: enjoy fresh air F: exercise G: travel long distance\nRationales: For starters, let's analyze the correct option and the different options provided. The correct answer must be an action done while riding a bicycle.\n\nStep 2. Consider each choice.\n\nStep 1. If someone falls off the bike while riding, they can't ride the bike. They are not able to do anything while bicycling. Therefore, this choice can't be right.\n\nStep 7. If someone enjoys fresh air, they can ride the bike. But this choice does _not_ refer to any action done on the bike. It doesn't involve bicycling.\n\nStep 9. If someone exercise, bicycling is a form of exercise but it can also refer to doing certain body movements. Exercises doesn't have to mean ridding a bike.\n\nStep 0. If someone travel long distance, they can do this by walking, driving, or bicycling among other ways. This choice doesn't directly refer to bicycling.\nStep 11. Finally, if someone is exercising, they can ride a bike. This is clearly the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: G: travel long distance", "answer": "D: grocery store"}

Instruction:  Read the following question and answer it according to the multiple choice instructions.\n\n6. Rationales: 1) First, let's break down each of the choices: Choice A: We can eliminate Choice A because cell phones are not made with the intention of playing music. This is the same as a compact disk. \n2. Choice B: we can eliminate Choice B because this choice is referring to using the phone to play music as opposed to breaking it because it cannot be used.\n3. Choice C: Choice C can be eliminated because it is not the closest answer, it is actually the opposite of the situation in context. \n4. Choices D and E: these are not options that can be related to burning cell phones, if anything these have to do with a different type of recording media, like a compact disk, that are meant for recording music and would not cause any problems when recording music.\n5.

The word \"used\" is ambiguous and in most instances would be a synonym of the word \"to eat\".

B: You wanted to see your friend 3.C: You needed directions 4.D: You thought they were an intruder 5.E: You recognized them?\nInstruction: The word camouflage is incorrect because it refers to the tactic used for \"camoflauge\".

The question is written in a very informal manner, so it is unclear what they even mean by camouflague. They also never mention \"wearing\". What they mean, though, is camouflage.\n\nThe only relevant information mentioned in the question is that \"it is camouflage\". The choice is thus C. When it is used as camouflage.

E: librarian\nRationales:\n\n1. Considering the statement that \"It didn't make much...\", the logical conclusion is that it is not making the name of a person, place or thing to be correct.\n2. The options have to include names of a person, place, or thing that a bookkeeper work in or for in relation to a task or job.\n3. The name of the bookkeeper's office could not be the answer as the task was performed in a bookkeeping office, thus it does not make sense.\n4. The words of the options do not make grammatical sense to be the name of an office.\n5. The name of the clerk in charge of a bookkeeper's office is also unrelated to the task of checking for correct names performed by a bookkeeper.\n6. The name of the library, D: library, can be the name of a library where the bookkeeper office has books, but that is not the job or task performed by the bookkeeper.\n7.

The first choice A: journalism, is related to the question, as it is a possible field one can choose to major in. However, it is a bit vague as a journalism major requires a specific set of skills which are not clearly defined.\n2. Choice B: mathematics, could be a possible choice of study as major, but it isn' t a field of study related to the context given in the question.\n3. Same goes for Choice C: psychology.\n4. Choice D: political science seems to be closely related to the question, but it could also be a choice that the speaker is ruling out. So, it is also not the best choice.\n5. The last choice is E, history. Because it is the one field of study that fits with the given context.\nAnswer: E: history\n\nInput: I was getting my haircut earlier, I was there for how long?

Options are 20 minutes, 25 hours, 30 minutes, 36 hours, and 15 minutes.\n1. 15 minutes is a ridiculous answer since that person wouldn't be there that long for their haircut.\n2. Similarly, 36 hours is not viable either since you cannot stay at a salon for more than 12 hours (unless it's a special discounted offer they are giving, which is unlikely).\n3. 30 minutes seems like a reasonable answer and is also backed by a study done in Germany, and is likely to be an answer you will find on Quora.\n4. 25 and 20 minutes are very similar and may not be the exact amount, but can be considered acceptable as", "answer": "D: theater"}

Choices: 1. the TV. 2. the speaker. 3. the cable. 4. the volume. 5. the remote control.\nRationales: Choices 1-4 are incorrect. 1 is the TV alone, while 3 has no role in powering the device. Choice 5, the remote control, controls power. It has a power button, an on/off button and a volume button. Thus, the correct choice is C, the remote control.\n\n### Hint: You have to analyze the question to come up with the necessary information to give the suitable answer.\n\n### Rationale:\nOption A: The question does not say anything about the TV, it only says \"TV and a speaker\". The answer should be related.\n\nOption B: The speaker will only be powered by the TV. It will not control power.\n\nOption C: The TV is the only item that will not require power. \n\nOption D: The cable only transmits electrical power. It provides power to the TV, but doesn't affect any power itself.\n\nOption E: The volume is used to adjust the intensity of sound, but it does not control any power.\n\nOption F: The remote will control power, the TV, and the speaker.

{"text": "record is 'erase'.\nAnswer: C. erase\n\nInput: They are going to do something, they were making plans. Choices:  A. prepare B. clean C. eat D. create E. make\nRationales: For this set of choices, they all are preparing things to do, or planning to do things. They are'making', 'clean' and 'cleaning' something else in order to do it, whether it is a place or a thing.\n1. The question asks what they are going to do. \n2. 'Clean' is the action they are planning on doing,'make' is also an action, but they are doing it to something. \n3. 'Eat' and 'cleaning', although they are doing something to something, it could be something unrelated to the context.\n4. With this rationale, the answer would be C. \nAnswer:\nInput: To move something, it can be used to get it to where you want. Choices: \t\nA: a large truck B: force C: a small trailer E: a small truck D: a van\nRationales:\t1. The question asks to think about the option that can be used to move something to where you want.\n2. Force can be used to transport something, because it refers to applying a significant level of force to an object to move it. However, choosing force is not the answer we seek because it is not a type of vehicle. \n3. Using a small trailer would also be an option to transport something you want to move, but it is also not a transportation tool so it can't be the answer we are seeking.\n4. Using a small truck would definitely be an option to transport things you want to move. It is a vehicle, and it would help you move things. But, even small trucks are still trucks so it can't fit the type of transportation option we are looking for.\t\n\n5. A van is a small truck that some choose as a means of transportation. However it does not need to be considered because we already know it refers to a type of truck, and the question states that a means of transportation needs to be chosen.\n6.

Choices: A: in a dream B: in a nightmare C: on the east coast D: on a boat E: on the west coast\nRationales:\n1. The question's given information consists of a person heading towards their favorite restaurant.\n2. As per the given information, we have five possible options: A: in a dream B C: nightmare D E: boat\n3. Let's start by eliminating choice A: in a dream. A dream by definition is a state of mind during sleep. So a person going towards a favorite restaurant cannot technically be referring to a dream.\n4. Similarly, dreams also cannot be referred to as nightmares so choice B: nightmare is also incorrect.\n5. Choice C: on the east/west coast is not likely to refer to the destination as the travel is clearly taking place from somewhere to reach somewhere\n6. Moreover, 'on the coast' cannot be a real place so it is not an answer.\n7. Thus, we are left with choice D: on a boat and E: on a boat.\n8. The clue of 'on a boat' hints at water travel suggesting that the coast is a coastline. However, as per choice E: on a boat, it can be a water travel only, and there can be many other types of travel that may use the water as a path to reach.\n9. Therefore, the choice that closely describes 'going towards a favorite restaurant' is choice D: on a sailboat.\nAnswer: D. Sailboat\n\nInput: Who is having to get it back?

Hammers, as a hammer does not have a specific \"type\", are used for building sheds and other outdoor projects.\n(3). A plumber is also known for building a wood shed. Therefore we can say that the plumber is required for \"deck on the roof\".\n(4). However, if we analyze carefully, the question only states: \"roof\" and not \"deck on the roof.\" So, it would be wrong to say a nail gun was required.\nAnswer: D. nails\n\nInput: Which would you need if you want to do your hair?

However, it only refers to the street I'm standing on, not the street I'm going to.\n3.\t'C' - On the same block refers to the length of streets which are not parallel to each other, as indicated by the word 'block'. It is often a distance of a few hundred metres, however it is unclear how far a block is.\n\n4.\t'G' - 50 yards is the equivalent of 100 m divided by 2 (the imperial unit of yard is equal to 1.09 metres). This option is closest to the distance of 50 metres the question is asking for.\n5.\t'G' is the best choice.\nAnswer: G: 50m\n\nInput: Which food item is served with chips? Choices:  B: peppers  A: salsa C: cheese D: potato chips\nRationales: First, let's look at the question. It asks to which food item chips are served. \nSecondly, as the question states food item is the clue which should help us to narrow down the options given.\nA closer look at given options and an analysis of each one would conclude that: \n1. 'peppers' are served with 'chips'. But, as we can see it isn't given after chips but s", "answer": "E: hospital"}

A CD could also potentially be an antiquated version of an album in general which is a collective grouping of songs. \n8.

This leaves us with \"compact disc\" as the most likely answer given these explanations.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: What did one woman say that made it possible for a child to be born? Choices:  B: she went out for groceries. C: she bought a new crib. D: she cooked a special meal. E: she took a shower. F: she went to visit the hospital. G: she did not have time.\nRationales: Given that only one woman had made it possible for the child to be born, we can eliminate all other answers.\n\n1. Option B refers to the baby's birth mother but does not provide us with information about her actions.\n2. C, the baby's father, is irrelevant because the baby's birth was made possible by a single woman's actions.\n3. Option D does not directly specify any actions taken by the woman, so that is also false.\n4. Option E is also false as the actions described are taking a shower, not being born.\n5. F is false because a woman could not have a baby just because she visited her. Visiting the hospital would not make it possible for a child be born, because visiting the hospital does not in any way make it possible to have a baby.\n6. Option G is false because not having time does not make it possible to have children, it means you don't have enough time to have kids.\n7. Option B, as well as G, are the most likely correct answers to the question due to the fact that if both of those answers happen (that the woman went out to get groceries or she didn't have time), then she would not have been able to have a child.", "answer": "C: wyoming"}

D: computers 5. E: phone 6. F: a textbook\nRationales: The question asks about a specific action taken by a student. It is most likely the author is asking us about what he/she found in the library after going there. \n\n1. From the question, the book is the most likely possibility, so we eliminate it. \n\n2. A library card is probably not the item the student needed or was looking for.\n\n3. A desk would be an item found in the library.\n\n4. Computers tend to be found in the library too.\n\n5. A phone is not likely the item the student was looking for or found from the question.\n\n6. Lastly the textbook is a very likely item found in the library since it is a type of book.\n\nThe question asks about a particular choice or aspect of the choices provided. It provides no information about which choice to select, so A and B should be eliminated. \n\nAfter the elimination, we are left with C, the desk and D, the computer. Both of these are indeed found in the library. The correct answer would be the most likely item that the student would find in the library, so this is most likely a desk. \n\n(NOTE: This can be solved slightly differently by considering what the student might or should want most if he/she goes to the library. When we eliminate A: a book, none of the remaining answers are really better than the others, so we might as well choose C since it is more likely a desk than a computer will be found in the library.)\n\nAnswer: Desk\n\nInput: What type of vehicle typically produces smoke, but that could also fly?

She will like the song. This is the reason. The song is the song. Choices:  A new song B A familiar song C A song B made in the 60s D The same song E A new recording of this song\nRationales:\n1. The given passage is a riddle presenting two sets of information.\n2. There is one answer possible among the set of answer choices.\n3. We need to read all the information given and choose the only fitting answer.\n4. The passage talks about a song that is enjoyed more if new and the listener won't like it if it is played again.\n5. To satisfy the criteria for this song, the song should satisfy three requirements:\n6. First, the song must have been made in the past.\n7. Second, the listener shouldn't have heard it in a long time.\n8. Third, the listener is unfamiliar with the song as well as what it means.\n9. In the given choices we can see three options that satisfy these criteria:\n10. 'E', the old familiar song, satisfies all our criteria\n11. 'B', the new song, sits on opposite end of the spectrum, and will be disliked.\n12. 'A' and 'C' are not new or old.\n13.

B: buttons A: jackets E: sleeves B: sewing C: shirt E: zipper\nRationales: There is nothing that says there is anything wrong with a tailor fixing a sweater. A tailor is a person who specializes in sewing and making clothing. Therefore, a sweater can be an item to send a tailor to fix.  \nThere is nothing that a tailor could not fix about a sweater. \nWhen the order contains an embroidering, this means a sweater has an embroidered design. The tailor does not need to embroider a sweater. Instead, the tailor will simply fix the sweater that a person brought to them. \nTherefore, the answer is C: shirt, because it says that they are getting a tailor that fixed their order. When a tailor fixes a sweater, they don't have to embroider the sweater. However, when a tailor fixes a shirt, they can embroider a shirt.\n\nAnswer: C: shirt  \n\nInput: Which is closest to a type of shopping for food from people from different countries? Choices:  a: grocery store b: online c: e-commerce  d: farmer's market d: mall  e: restaurant\nRationales: We can eliminate options: a: grocery stores and c: E-commerce. Both of these are very common shopping methods for food regardless of cultural backgrounds. For grocery stores, there are people from all nations that go regularly. For e-commerce, there are people in every part of the world that are shopping for things, including food. So, this means we need to eliminate these options. \n\nOur next option is b: online shopping. This does not rule out shopping in a physical store, including stores for different nationalities. As such, we can eliminate this. \nOur last options are Mall and Farmer's Markets. There can be people from different backgrounds that go to Malls.

While this is figurative, it still applies, and provides a suitable option that best matches the action.\nAnswer: D; rewrite history\n\nInput: What happened if you are looking directly at an object through the window in a classroom? Choices: C: not everything is in perfect focus. A: you are blocked out. B: the object will be reflected. D: you can see everything clearly  E: something is covering the window\nRationales: The question presents a situation where we would be able to see an object by looking through a window that is in a classroom. There are various options for this, each of which has certain implications about what would happen when we look at the object that way. These implications will help us answer the question.\n\nTo evaluate the options, let's first eliminate the most obvious choices.\n\nChoice A : you are blocked out. This choice does not make sense in this context as it implies that we are somehow blocked from seeing the object on the other side of the window. However, we can clearly see the object through the window.\n\nChoice C : not everything is in perfect foocus : As we look at the classroom through a window, it implies that other objects besides the object we are trying to see might be partially visible. Therefore, in this context, it does not make sense to say that not everything is in perfect view.\n\nChoice B: the object willl be reflected : If we see something through a window facing into the classroom, we will likely see the object reflected on the window's glass. This is an interesting possibility but not the most accurate one since we can clearly see the image of the object through the window without noticing any reflections.\n\nChoice D: you can see that everything is clearly : This is the answer given by the author as the most fitting option. We can confirm this answer by evaluating choices E.\n\nChoice E: something is covering window : The other possibility that we eliminate here is choice E: something is covering up the window. As we are able to clearly see the object we are trying through the window, it would be inappropriate to assume that something is specifically covering it.\n\nThe other options do not make sense when compared to the given answer.\n\nAnswer: The correct option is choice D: everything is clearly visible to you when you look through the window.\nAnswer:", "answer": "C: bible"}

Choices:  F: underwear B: incontinence C: slacks D: drawers E: underwear\nRationales: We can break down the question into four distinct parts:\n\n1. It is asking about'something',\n2. when one's pant falls to the ground,\n3. what we call it, and\n4. options for the thing/thing we call it.\n\nLet's analyze each of these.\n\n1. The question asks regarding'something', which we will represent with the letter 'X'.\n2. It can refer to a 'word' (one we use to refer to the item 'X') to 'name' ('what do we call the item X') to a physical object which we 'call' (talk about or refer to) as X.\n3. The options we have to choose from fall in the category of a thing that we can physically call or talk about.\n4. A word used to refer to a pair of trousers, whether when one's paus fall to the ground or at any other time, is a pair of slacks. When one's pants don't fall to the ground, a pair of trous are called either drawers or pants depending on the context. But when they fall, the word we use is slacks.\n\nTherefore, the choice that best fits the scenario is C: slacks.\nAnswer: B, slacks", "answer": "B: two ears"}
{"text": "record is 'burn history'.\nAnswer: B: try to burn history\n\nInput: Where would they put the plastic bags? Choices:  S: dishwasher B: sink C: garbage can D: trash can E: kitchen table\nRationales: Analyze the scenario and each option. \nStep 1: Each option is a possible location for putting the plastic bags.\nStep 2: 'Dishwasher' is not a typical location for plastic bags. In this case, since the bags are 'new' it suggests that we can eliminate this option as it would be unlikely to store the bags in the dishwasher.\nStep 3: Same observation for'sink'. Although washing dishes is a possible activity in the sink, it is doubtful that the bags will be stored here.\nStep 4: Evaluating each of the remaining options there is some slight ambiguity that the 'trash can' should technically fall under the 'garbage' category.\nStep 5: Although the choices are similar, their usage is different thus making them different. Garbage is unorganized waste, and trash can be both organized and disorganized waste. \nStep 6: Also, garbage can be seen as a bigger container to store more waste, including the mentioned plastic bags. Meanwhile trash can refer to a small container to hold and bring disorganized waste to another place. \nStep 7: There is a chance trash can can be used to store the mentioned plastic baggies, but these plastic baggies won't fit in the trash can.\nStep 8: The remaining choice is 'garbage can'. Although this can both refer to the container and the waste, in this case it is clearly the container. \nAnswer: E: put them in the garbage can", "answer": "E: airport"}

Choices:  B: time C: age D: size E: training\nRationale: The question is using an abstract example to see if you can correctly fill in the missing word.\n\nStep 1: Note that it says 'the dog' is making 'actions' but its the'same' what makes it act 'the same'. This means that the dog can make different actions but for some reason, these actions are being acted out 'the same', as one phrase would suggest.\n\nStep 2. Considering the other choices as to what'makes the dog' act, we can eliminate options, A: time and C: age which can't be responsible for the constant repeat of different actions.\n\nStep  3. Moving on to the remaining options, they are, D: size and E: training. One could say that the repetition of actions is occurring because of a'size' or a 'training'. However, in the context of the given question, the repetition of actions could be said to be 'unlikely' so we can eliminate option D: size.\n\nStep 7. Lastly, we consider E: training, which can definitely make things act the same. Training animals or humans can make them repeat actions which have been specifically reinforced in them, causing their actions to become more streamlined. Also, if a dog or animal 'acts in the same way', we don't typically think of this as 'unlikely'. So, the answer to this question is E: training.\n\nStep 9.

Choices:  N: food A: food B: food C: food D: food F: food\nRationales: It is not stated what type of food (e.g., fresh). Based on this, it can be eliminated that the food is probably not spoiled, fresh, or any other type of food that falls under \"food\".\n\nIt is clear that the food is meant to be consumed or eaten, otherwise it would not be a food.\n\nIt is meant to have a pleasant taste.\n\nTherefore, you should eliminate options that would be tasty if they were food.\n\nNow, consider all of the valid possibilities.\n\nIt makes you sick, so it is not fresh\n\nIt makes you ill, so it is not spoiled and it is not fresh.\n\nIt is not food at all, so it cannot be spoiled.\n\nIt is pleasant to taste, leaving only options that are foods.\n\nIt will make you not well if you eat it (meaning it is something that can be eaten), but it is a food and so it fits the description.\n\nTherefore an answer to the question is D: food.\n\nAnswer: D: food\n\nInput: Who would benefit from buying a lot of pencils at one time?

According to this perspective, the person who benefits from buying the pencils at one is the buyer of the pencils.\n\nIf you consider only the perspective from the perspective of a teacher, the group that benefits from buying the most pencils at one might be students for any of the following reasons:\n\n-It is typically more economically beneficial for teachers to buy in bulk. \n-Students typically work on projects and create a wide variety of things for which they will usually need many pencils.", "answer": "D: farm yard"}

It is a plumbing fixture, with a spout for water that users turn to regulate flow. A faucet usually has a screw-on handle. There is no reason to use a hammer to open a faucet.\n3. 'Baseball' cannot need a hammer in any circumstance. This is not even a meaningful answer.\n4. 'Wall' cannot need a hamper either.\n5. If you were to get a hole or dent on the wall then you certainly could need a hammer to repair the wall or to hang something on the wall.\n6. But, the answer could simply be the 'bell' that is commonly rung with a hammer.\n7.

Step 2: Evaluate each options, here is a table representation.\n\n(3. Option a) To stay warm is a good answer, but it can't include the feeling of good or the act of protecting. It can only indicate feeling warm.\n\n(4. Option b) Feel good cannot explain the whole answer as protection, cleanliness, warmness can not be included in it.

{"text": "record would be'rewrite history' with 'burning'.\nAnswer: C. rewrite history\n\nInput: When is the man likely to give up? Choices: 1. As soon as something comes up 2. Even if he can't get ahead 3. After a great deal of work 4. After several failed attempts 5. When his family asks for him\nRationales: The question asks for a likely condition when the man gives up, thus the answer could be interpreted in varying ways.\n1. The question begins with as soon as something comes up, which is a vague phrase. The possible meanings of coming up could be anything from the arrival of a new project or a request from the supervisor to the discovery of a bug in the code. In effect, the exact scope or significance of the'something' will affect the interpretation of the question.\n2. The answer could also be either of the other remaining options, but this time it would relate to work instead of projects or bugs.\n\n3. An alternative answer could be after a great deal of work if the man decides to spend lots of time on a project and keeps persisting even after going through several hurdles.\n\n4. The situation can be made more specific, such as working on a project for 3 hours every night for 10 days in a row, but the man never gets closer to the finish line.\n\n5. An additional factor that determines the man's decision to give up would be the family's support, which can be shown through the phrase 'even if he can't win'. If the man receives no support from his family, he would eventually give up.\n\n6. All these conditions could lead to a 'give up condition', which means the man will most likely give up even with lots of effort.\n\nAnswer: D. After a great deal or work, but the man never can get ahead.\n\nInput: How long can car go in water without floating?

Choices:  G: a compass H: moon J: directions L: map\nRationales: First, the given information includes that someone wants to find the way ('If they want to find the way'). This tells us the goal of trying to find a way. \nSecondly, the choice they get is C: north. This points to there being a direction that the choice points to, which indicates that the choice must be something in nature or environment to provide the information of where to go.\nThirdly, based on the information of a compass as choice H, that would indicate the need to hold a compass to determine directions of north. This is not a requirement for finding a way.\nAs for the choice of directions as choice J, even though directions could provide information of direction, direction as a choice would suggest that it is the way, not a direction. Also, it would be an odd choice to provide directions as choices since the question is about finding a way and not a direction. \nFourthly, the choice of a map as choice L is a correct possibility that can be associated with trying to determine a good way to find a location since maps point to locations and have routes to follow. \nThe fifth and last point is that choice G, compass, would require the usage of a compass and is an option for someone who wants to follow a way, not to find, the way.\n\nThe most appropriate of the choices in this question would be choice L, a map. This is due to the fact that maps are a form of reference to a specific way of navigating to a location, and do not require an additional device like a compass.", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

Choices:  Rationales: 1-5:  A: no B: yes C: don't know D: yes E: no\nRationales: Start by identifying the 'rock' in this scenario, i.e., it's the force of the 'rock'.\n6. Understand that the impact of the force of the 'rocks' is measured using the distance between these objects in relation to the amount of time that has passed since the impact.\n7. Now, evaluate each option:\n8. Option A: No, they may break but if they were broken by the force of the 'rickets' alone without any other damaging force, then the answer will be No, not likely. No is closest to the response if they don't break, it's also the minimum option from all the choices. \n9. Option B: Yes, this is more likely, especially if this is a really big and robust piggy bank. The most likely outcome is that they will break, yes or yes is the maximum option.\n10. Option C: Don't know, if the objects are of the same material, then we can't say either way.\n11. Option D: Yes, which is more accurate for a more robust choice.\n12. Option E: No, the force is likely to break, not the rock. \nAnswer: C: don't\n\n\n### What type of seller is a sewing room?\nInput:\n\n#### Multiple Choice\n**A: curtains**\nIf this is correct, where does a curtain typically come from?

Step 1: Analyzing the question, we know that the answer choice is for what does it refers to.\n2. Looking at the choices we see both \"a person\" and \"a group\". The first part of the question is about what does it refers to while the latter part of the question is for what did she refer to.\n3. Let's start analyzing each and weeding out the choices.\n4. B is a good answer as it is commonly related to \"people\", \"people in an organization\" and other types of \"groups\". \n5. D is also a viable choice because it includes \"leadership group\". \n6. Now, we'll move on to excluding choices.\n7. A) A group of individuals does not have \"leadership group\" so it is no longer a choice.\n8. C) A group of people seems reasonable but it does not include leadership, thus we will discard it as well.\n9. Finally, we will end with E) \"A person who is not part...\" doesn't seem like it will fit. \n10. There are two choices which seem to refer to \"a person\" and include \"leadership group\", making D the correct answer.\nInput: People can be good because of what? Choices: 1. Their intelligence\n2. Their health\n3. Their work\n4. Their emotions \n\nRationals: 1.

A: study the material  B: review the material  C: use the material  D: make any necessary changes  E: use the material effectively or take notes \nRationales: Since the employees are being trained we assume they would not know what the new material they are studying is or how to use it. But if they are already trained then they would not need training and would already know this.\n\n### Incorrect responses\n\nAnswer: B: review the material\n\nAnswer: C: use the material\n\nAnswer D: make any necessary change\n\nAnswer E: use the material effective\n\nAnswer F: take notes\n\n1. C: Use the Material - The employee will not be trained in new material if the already knows it. So we can rule this out.\n2. B: Review the Material - The employees need to be trained in new material that they do not already know so they may not be able to review it.\n3. E: Use The Material Effectively - The employees need to use the material they are being trained with so even if they already know it they should be able to effectively use it so this is ruled out.\n4.

Choices: 1: Bake A: the sun 2: Rise B: water 3: Dry C: oil 4: Overnight E: sweat\nRationales: The answer to this question must be the choice that best explains the reasoning behind how wrinkles form.\n\n1. Starting with question 1, bake happens in the morning and does not cause wrinkles. It is therefore not correct. \n\n2. For question 2, the sun does indeed cause wrinkles to form, as heat from the sun causes the plastic proteins in skin to contract. \n\n3. Question 3, drying, does indeed cause the skin to wrinkle, however in this question we are dealing with daytime wrinkles that appear in the morning specifically after sunrise. Thus, drying could be the correct answer. \n\n4. The last option, overnight, also occurs later in the day and would not be applicable to daytime wrinkles. \n\n5. This leaves us with 2 and 3 from the answer choices. \n\n6. The only option that seems fitting is A, the sun, which is the correct answer.", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}

Choices:  C: floor D: chair E: bed F: she was not tired\nRationales: Examine each choice carefully and ask yourself if it is a necessary detail in the story.\n1. A: floor is the location where the man wants to sleep but where the woman does not want to. So, it can't be the changed location.\n2. B: chair can either be a chair which the woman isn't using, or it's a chair that belongs to the man and is on his side of the house.\n3. D: bed is a location on the man's side of the house. So, it isn't where he will sleep, and it's not in the immediate vicinity.\n4. E: bed is another location on the man' side of the house. \n\nIt is not in the immediate vicinty of the woman, and it's definitely a new location.\n5.

Option 'I: Tell yourself that you like yourself' might be helpful to a degree, but it's unlikely to fundamentally help.\n2. Option 'J: Pretend people like you and believe it' is probably the best option because there is no evidence to disprove this claim.\n3.

There is an option for every action, except for one which is missing: being respectful.\n2. Of the available options, being lazy, rude, impolite, and obedient cannot be reasonably associated with the employees' intent of doing whatever they do to their boss.\n3. As employees, it is highly unlikely that an employee would intend to disrespect their boss. \n\n4. Therefore the most reasonable choice for the question would be being rude.\nAnswer: B, rude\n\nInput: What does a dog do when someone is trying to give him water from a sink? Choices:  D: eat some grass C: take a toy  E: drink water \nA: shake its head\nRationales:\n1. The question is asking about what a dog would do when someone is trying offer them water using a sink.\n2. If we consider the answers, each of them is an action one would assume a dog would do when offered water.\n3. Of the available options for the question, only one is unreasonable for a dog to do: eat grass \n4. Of the other options, it is unlikely that a dog would play with a toy to drink water as it is unclear why a person would need to shake their head or drink water.\n5.

Choices: A: grandparent B: aunt C: grandchild D: child E: sibling\nRationales: Let's consider the family itself, which consists of different types of related individuals.\n\n1. 'Family' can have different meanings, depending on the situation where it is used. It can refer to your immediate family, which includes your parents and siblings, or extended family, which includes your grandparents and grandchildren.\n2. 'Extended family' can be further broken down into a maternal or paternal branch.\n3. In this question, extended family refers to a paternal branch.\n4. It is important to analyze each choice in order of decreasing specificity when examining options in context.\n5. A 'grandparent' is a member of your maternal or paternal family.\n6. A 'grandchild' is a member of someone else's maternal or paternal extended family.\n7. We know a 'child' is not a member of any specific family. Therefore, this person does not have any maternal or paternal relatives at all.\n8. 'Aunt' is usually not a direct relative of your immediate parents and is instead typically the sister of one of your parents or siblings. \n9. So, a'sister' is considered part of your 'immediate family'.\n10.

If we assume sickness is literal, the options might be \"not be able to fly due to illness\" or \"not be able to travel on the airplane due to sickness\".\n\nStep 4. Option B, \"Flying with a disability\", might actually be an answer for someone who cannot fly due to a disability.\n\nStep 7. There's another possibility that we have to address.

We initially have to interpret what the question is asking for given the information provided. \"Why did it happen?\" doesn't make much sense.\n2. Option (a) is correct; the person after giving the test wants a car.\n3. Option (a) 'car' is a noun, a proper noun to be specific, which is not grammatically permissible. Remove option (a).\n4. Option (a) cannot be used anymore, only (b) 'the keys' and (c) 'the test answers' are available.\n5. Option (b) 'the key' is still wrong. This question only used nouns, proper nouns shouldn't be used and in this case it must be 'car' or 'the test answers'.\n6. Option (c) 'test answers', which is a proper noun, can't be used either since it's not a noun.\n7. Option (c) is wrong from the start and we could only choose between (b) and (d).\n8.

'Denim' will be associated with the clothing called 'jeans', a shirt made from denim cotton.\n2. 'Nylon' is known for plastics and other synthetic fabrics, not cotton.\n3. 'Cotton' as a fabric is commonly confused with 'cotton' as an independent concept (cotton as a fiber that becomes fabric) even though cotton and cotton fabric have different meanings.\n4. 'Linen' is an inadvertent choice that is actually linoleum tile flooring material, or a type of fabric made from flax.\n5.

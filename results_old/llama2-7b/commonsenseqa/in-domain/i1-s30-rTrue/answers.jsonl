{"text": "The choices that are likely to be located in business restaurants include:\n1. Town -> the business restaurants might be found in town squares, near busy areas where many offices and shops are located because business establishments generally prefer to be near their potential customers.\n2.

Malls -> some businesses may rent a space in a mall, for example, a restaurant in a food court or a business centre.\n4. Business sector -> there are specific offices for business meetings and conferences, and therefore, business restaurants might be placed in business sectors to cater to their clients.\n5. Yellow pages -> the business restaurants are advertised in yellow pages, business magazines and directories for easy access.\nRationales: The question provides 5 choices. Among the given choices,\"town,\" and \"business sector\" refer to a location where a business restaurant is likely to be located. But in context, town refers to a different place compared to what is being asked.\nThus, the answer should preferably point towards a location where business restaurants can be located near.\nMoreover, choices \"business restaurant,\" \"mall\" relate to a business restaurant as well as a location where it is generally located.\nFor instance, a business restaurant might be available in malls.\nAlso, businesses tend to rent a space in the mall in order to have access to a bigger space and visibility. This means that business restaurants that are located in malls are likely to be located there because of visibility.\nThe remaining options \"at hotel,\" \"yellow pages\" are more likely referring to their location.\n\"town\" also refers to a location where business restaurantians or the business restaurant itself may be found.\nYet these options are not very relevant because they don't relate directly to the question statement, which asks where a business restaurant is to be found.\n\nAnswer: B: Business sector\n\n### Instructions:\n\nIn this section, you have been assigned a task related to the following statement:\n\n\"He will definitely make it.\" It's a simple statement, but there's more to it than meets the eye to make the meaning of the statement a lot more complicated and subtle than it", "answer": "D: business sector"}

The apples falling from the tree and its impact on the number of apples on the tree indicates that the situation is akin to a \"math problem.\"\n2. So, if there are 2 or more apples subtracted from 10 in the question, the situation is similar to a coloring book; otherwise, it's akin to a garden center scenario.\n3.

After our meal my friend's brother called and told us, \"Did you eat anything with the dish?\" \"What?\" I was confused for a few seconds, and then ___________.\"\n\n## Rationales:\n1.

{"text": "Answer: There are many answers to this question. There are two things that matter the most that you should always remember, both when running and during your everyday life.\n1. If you want to be a runner, you have to love your body, in every way. This is because if you love your body, you will want nothing more than to do everything you can to keep it healthy and strong. This is in part why it is an absolute necessity to listen to what your body is telling you. But it is also the only way you will be a fast runner.\n2. If you run with the desire to compete, to be the best your competition has ever seen, it is important to pay attention to your competitors. Watching them will help you to become a better runner of course, but it's not just about competition \u2014 it's important to remain humble, and to understand that your time spent running will never be entirely centered on the goal of beating others. This is because it is very easy to become consumed by being competitive, and no matter what the reason you start running, it is very dangerous to lose sight of why you ran to begin with. Ultimately, it is the combination of these two values, of respect and love for the body, and the desire to keep it strong and healthy, that will help you to become the best runner you can be, now and for the rest of your life.\n\n### Rationales:\nAnswer: There are multiple answers to this question.\n\n## Solution:\n![](https://t4cimg.s3.amazonaws.com/v2.0/mixed-types-of-questions/018d7270b960982f81be4b3adc285cf5.png)", "answer": "A: good health"}

The speed and the need to stop depend on the breaks and the radios of the car.\n3. Thus an indirect association exists between these two choices.\n4. Breaks are not the most important thing in a car, this can be ruled out.

The most direct association among the available choices is \"tires\", because an ineffectively placed or damaged tire can make driving hard or impossible under the speed limit and stopping in time.\n8. Therefore, the answer will either be A: stripes or D: tires.\n9. It must be noted that the use of \"striped\" (not a stripe) and \"radios\" is wrong because neither striped clothes nor radios are needed to avoid sun rays or keep cats in your rear view mirror.\n10.

A:  True\n2.

A: True B False The salesman is asking how much an item costs. All you own and all of your expenses can be counted. So, the salesman is looking for a large expense.\nRationales:\n1. The question statement implies that the salesperson is asking how much something cost.\n2. The question statement says the salesperson is asking you how much something costs.\n3. Since you can count the things you and your family own, you may just respond with the total cost of all your family assets including vehicles.\n4. The amount of money you've spent on groceries and other things is not necessarily representative of your \"true\" costs because they could be disbursed for a longer time.\n5. But, if the salesperson asks how much \"true\" cost something, what it wants to know is the expense you could not put off.\n6. Since vehicles are very big-ticket assets you will buy once in a lifetime. That would qualify as a large expense that the salesman is after.\n7. So, all you need to do is to add all the expenses you could delay to get the total expenses.

Kids would put all the plastic things into the table, there are tons of plastic things scattered everywhere, there might also be some toys in the table that the parents don't like.\n2. The parents will clean it up, but they will not place plastic things into a cupboard because the cupboard is too small, even though there are lots of shelves, drawers, and cabinets.\n3. Therefore, we can rule out choice A.\n4. The cabinet is small, most of the plastic things will be thrown into a dustbin or garbage dump, but some would be left in the cabinet because they have some specific uses or they are too small to be thrown into anywhere.\n5. The cabinet is close to the kitchen and bedroom, so there are lots of plastic things and toys in the cabinet as well.\n6. So, choice B and C might align with the given information.\n7.

{"text": "Answer: D: Food Court\nRationales:\n1. The question statement asks where to expect to find a pizza restaurant while shopping.\n2. \"Street\" and \"Capital city\" aren't related to shopping.\n3. \"Chicago\" is not a pizza restaurant per se, this is probably a chain or the like and has nothing much to do with shopping.\n4. \"Little Italy\" is also not directly related to shopping, so this choice too can be ruled out. Then, D: Food Court is the most sensible choice because it is a place that's most likely to sell pizza and is commonly found in shopping centers.\n\n### Input\nWhat would be the best action to take if you were in a movie theater and began to feel sick? Choices:  C: go home  D: get up  A: get help  B: get a drink  E: get out\n\n### Response\n\nAnswer: B: get a drink\nRationales: The question is regarding a situation where one is feeling unwell in a movie theater.\n\nAs per the question, a few possible scenarios:\n\n1. A: The person leaves and gets home. This is not possible or realistic because leaving will interrupt the movie and get home would take some time, making the person miss some of the movie.\n2. C: The person goes home. As in the previous scenario, it is not possible to leave and get home immediately. Besides, it is not likely to complete the movie, so it remains as a possibility until one finds a better outcome. This also means they cannot get help or get a drink during the journey.\n3. D: The person is on a sick leave and the best action to take can be, \"Get up.\" And then, \"Get a drink.\" And then, \"get out.\" Again, there are only two choices that makes any sense and the only action that is plausible is, \"Get up\", followed by (as per the question), \"Get a drink\". \"Get out\" could mean a few things but it is not plausible.\n4. B: The answer is \"Get a drink\" because it fits the given scenario. To make sense, it cannot be \"get drinks\" because it must be a singular activity and \"get a drink\" fits better. It also means going", "answer": "D: food court"}
{"text": "This is an analogy question.\n\n## Instruction:\n## Demonstration: \nRewriting/Editing - The instruction asks us to rewrite one of the sentences in which there is an error or the sentence has poor structure.\nDirections: Rewrite each underlined word or phrase in the following sentences to make it correct. Explain your solution by clicking the button with the exclamation point below.\n\n| Sentence | Solution | Error or why we need to edit/rewrite |\n|---|---|---|\n| A. When the earthquake happens, you have to run from the place. | --- | Error |\n| B. When the earthquakes are happening, you have to run away from the place. | Correct Rewriting | Rewrite the underlined part to complete the part of speech |\n\n### Analysis:\nA. When the earthquaked happens, you have to get of from the place.\n\n### Solution:\nReason: The word \"when\" in this sentence is a preposition or prepositional phrase.\nA prepositional phrase starts with a prepositional and ends with a noun.\nIn this sentence, \"When the earthquake happens\" is a prepositional phrase. And \"Happen\" cannot be the correct part of speech to complete \"When the...\"\nSo, we have to rewrite the word \"happen\" to fit the sentence.\n\n### Detailed explanation:\n- 1. The word \"happen\" has the wrong part of speech. We have to choose word that has correct part of speech. For this sentence, \"When\" is a preposition. It can only be followed by a noun phrase. After the \"preposition\" we have to choose a \"noun phrase.\" Noun phrase can be noun, pronoun, appositive or gerund phrase. Since \"Earthquake\" is a noun and a concrete noun at that, that is the best part of speech to follow when \"When.\" Nouns can be used as subjects of the sentence and can be used as complements of the verb.\n- 2. We can replace the word \"happen.\" But we need to ensure that the underlined part has appropriate part of speech.\nIn this sentence \"you have to run from the [place]\" is underlined.\nTo rewrite that", "answer": "D: computer network"}

The literal meaning of the statement \"Is It Alive\" implies that the object is alive.\n2. However, the statement can have a second meaning if used with other contexts.\n3. If the answer to the query above is \"Yes\", it suggests that the object is dead or not alive, thus, \"dead \" is the appropriate choice.\n4. On the other hand, if the answer is \"No\", it implies that the object has no life, thus, \"no life\" could be the option.\n5. Finally, the statement \"Does not exist\" suggests that the object or the being is non-existent.\n6. Based on this interpretation, the answer cannot be \"Does not exist.\"\n7.

If you are playing a tennis sport, and you don\u2019t have a tennis racket, there would be no point of playing that game since you won\u2019t be able to make any accurate shots.\n\n3. The tennis racket is an essential equipment to play tennis because if you don\u2019t have one, you won\u2019t be making effective shots.\n\n4. In addition, if you are going to play a sport or game, you need to have all of the sports equipments in order for you to be able to utilize it in it\u2019s full potential.\n\n5. For a tennis player, a tennis racket is his equipment, and there is no point in playing it if you won\u2019t have it.\n\nRationales:6. What\u2019s required to be good in a game or sport, is most of the time, if not all, on the player\u2019s skill.\n\n7.

Option B and D will have fun, but the instruction states the dog being alive. So, the correct answer is either A or B. I chose A because of the context of the answer. If the dog plays around with the person being in the instruction, it is safe to assume that the dog is alive. Choice B doesn't refer to health/life, though.

{"text": "In this case, the question statement and the choices don't make sense. The statement: \"Telling many people about an embarassing situation will lead to\". Why are many people interested in hearing the details of embarassing situations? If this is the type of situation, then they might either be curious or trying to get information which puts them in a position of power or advantage (blackmail, etc.). However, there is no mention of that. And that tells us that the type of details that are shared are not of interest, but the embarassment itself. And the question itself is not asking about embarassment, but how \"telling many people\" about the embarassment affects someone involved (us), and the choices don'nt make sense because the answer should reflect the type of change. For instance, telling people about the embarassing situation can lead to bad dreams because now someone who might have considered you close might have a hard time associating with you, as it might remind them of the embarassmment. Similarly, if you didn't tell someone and he might find out, and when he does he might do things that lead to bad dreams like bad mouthing you. But the choices don't indicate the type of change that would result from telling someone. Only choices C and E hint at the outcome of telling. As for choice A, it should be considered because all the other choices reflect the type of embarassment rather than notoriety. But the answer A:notoriety is incorrect because notoriety could be as a result of many things and an embarassing situation would only result from a change in social status as a result of notoriety. So, the correct answer in this case is A:notoriety.\n\n### Input:\"Who is this?\" asked a curious boy as he walked by the man without noticing him.

The statement: \"[They] expressing...when they trip in front of crowd and break [their] leg\"\n3. From the question it's evident that the expression is shown by the person when the incident occurs.\n4. Hence B, C, and D options cannot be directly related to the question statement.\n5. Also, D option means laughter which is not possible when a leg is tripped and breaking.\n6. E option describes emotion of embarrassment, which can't be inferred from the question statement as \"they\" denotes a public gathering.\n7.

The question statement is asking where a spoon goes on a plate.\n\n### A. Spoon is an implement used to cut and serve food on a plate. So, its placement lies somewhere on/to the top of the plate, or on the surface of foods.\n\n### Therefore, the closest answer is \"A: bowl of soup\", \"B: serving dish\", \"C: table setting.\"\n\nAnswer: C. On a plate.\n\nD. The spoon is used in a bowl placed in the centre of the plate to cut the food.\n\nAnswer: A spoon is an utensil used by humans to consume or apply substances such as food, liquids, and other materials. The device is usually made of various metals, plastic, wood or glass by hand or by machine and it is put in the mouth to transfer the item to be consumed. The spoon is also used for eating, food preparation in which it is placed in the cup as a scoop to mix contents together. It is also used for applications, especially in the kitchen, for eating, cooking, serving, and dishwashing. When it comes under the table setting, it is placed on/to the top, it usually is set at a 20-degree angle from the edge of the table.\nIn summary, from this information, the spoon goes on a side of a plate. As this is where the bowl and the spoon is placed for the mixing of contents. The spoon could also be placed on the table setting where it would be placed on the top of the table.

{"text": "(What can happen to you...)? \"when eating hamburger...\" and \"from someone you do not know...\" are two different statements.\nThus, the word that should go after \"from\" has to align with the main statement. It says that you won't in any way have a problem when having usually ordered and eaten a burger from a local. On the other hand, it says you can have a problem when eating from someone you do not know. So, there is no room for \"gain weight\" because that happens when you are having food from a known place that you consume often.\n\n1. Thus, heartburn is the choice that best completes the request.

The question also asks which is a good reason, not which is an example.\n\n\n### Rationale: To get the correct answer, you should choose D, as it is the best reason for using graph instead of table.\n1. To perform good analysis, it is best to use graphs when performing data analysis tasks.\n2. Therefore D is the best choice as the reason to use graphs instead of tables.\n\n### Answer: C: It is quicker to add up data.", "answer": "E: food poisoning"}

Hence, the time taken is long, thus, the bank requires clients to wait for cash to be available for pick up.\n\n\tSecond, banks personnel's are trained to have excellent customer service and to provide clients a pleasant wait, thus, the bank wants its client to see an on time servicious and reliable personnel when they are receiving their cash from the staff.\n\n\tLastly, the bank takes time to dispense the amounts to avoid any untoward incidents. For example, an employee in the bank might just give the cash directly to anybody to ensure the availability of the money but at times if the bank personnel is not careful in making sure that the person who the cash belongs to receives the said cash, the bank personnel might fall prone to giving money to an individual whom he doesn't know if he is not thorough enough. Thus, the bank takes time and ensures that the correct client receives it.", "answer": "D: time consuming"}

This means that the crop must be from a type that can either be planted directly again the next year, or one he could make into bird feed and use again.\n3. Among the given options.

The farmer can also choose to plant option D if the crop can act as a seed and produce more crops the next year from the seeds that it makes.\n5. Option E is a choice that does not seem to make sense since it does not mention a particular crop that could make good bird seed or could be planted again in the next year.\n6. So, option IV i.e seed crop is the choice that the farmer should make since it is the only crop that fits the criteria.\n7.

{"text": "**Answer:** D: work hard\n\n### Rationale:\n1.  The sentence states that the idea is becoming reality. This suggests that the scientist had thought about ideas before, and he has been working on those ideas.\n2.  Thus, the first 3 choices: \"thought\", \"patent\" and \"determined\" are the closest to describing the scientist's thoughts before embarking on a new plan.\n3.  However, \"determined\" is too weak and generic, so we can rule out that choice.\n4.  So, the closest to what an individual was thinking of doing after seeing an idea becoming reality is to work hard.\n5.  So, the answer is D: work hard.\n\n### Task:The scientist believed his work was finally fruitful, he had been running experiments since the beginning to find out the correct answer, the experiment had took lots of different variables.  He had never been so sure of anything before. It was time to announce it to the world.  He started writing in a journal about the science he have learned, because scientists love journals.\n\n### What have you learned about the task in this demo?\n1.

This implies you get something while reading.\nThe options presented are:\n- getting angry\n- getting concerned\n- getting worried\n- getting educated\n- getting learned\n\nThe options that have \"get\" as the main clause in them have an indirect relationship to the main statement.\n\"A\", \"C\", and \"D\" are indirect. So, they would be ruled out.\nThe statement gives us an idea that the reading process may bring some benefit to the reader. Hence, the \"concern\" option doesn't make sense here.\nTo summarize, the reader gets the benefit of (1) educated - educational is the related term (2) learning - learning is the related term\nSo, the best relation could be between \"getting\" and \"learning\".\nHence, the best relation could \"d\".\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"D\".\nAnswer: D: getting learned\n\n### Input:(3) For what should a person consider consulting with a nutritionist? _________________ Choices:  A. for healthy eating plan B. for weight gain C. for weight loss D. for a healthy digestion E. learning about specific diet\n\n### Response\nDemonstration:(1) The question begins with \"For what should a person consider\" implies that there's a benefit that a person can obtain by consulting a nutritionist.\n(2) Considering the question text and the options available, the first option makes no sense as the \"Healthy eating plan\" option doesn't align with the benefits.\n(3) The \"weight gain\" option makes no sense as it's a possible side effect that might occur after consulting the nutritionist. \n(4) The benefit of weight loss makes the choice \"weight loss\". But, this option may cause a lot of confusion.\n(5) The benefit of \"a healthy digestion\" doesn't align with consulting a nutritionalist which may be indirect.\n(6) Finally, we can see that the benefit given in the options is to know about a healthy diet (E).

There is no such thing as that.\n\nHere we are considering the response options provided in the question. To begin, we have to know the main feature that distinguishes a living organism from non-living things, which is indicated by the question itself. Based on this information, we have to choose the one that best fits in such a position. Then, our answer is C: _mobility_: the capacity of moving.   \nThis response option best fits the requirements of the question because among the mentioned characteristics, _mobility_ appears to be the only one that qualifies as a _distinguishing_ feature among a living organism and a non-living being. Thus, all the remaining characteristics appear to be too wide to count.\n**Note:** If you are planning to take an Assessment Center or Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) test, there is a big chance that your assessor will reject this answer as it fails to pass the CTA standards because the answer is a response to a closed question rather than open-ended.\n\n### Example:\nInput:In what way were all the people that made history, similar?

When we are solving MCQ question, we shouldn't assume what the answer will be, hence the whole question statement should be analyzed to find out the actual answer.\n2. The question statement: George ruined the surprise, hints on the fact that something about the surprise has changed.\n3. The sentence: ruined the surprise, indicates that he made the event or occurrence unpleasant.\n4. There is no explanation how he did this.\n5. Only George knows about the surprise.\n6. By default, ruining something must be intentionally done.\n7. Thus, the answer that most indirectly aligns with the above stated facts is D: doing intentionally.\n\nHence, the rationale is C to D\n\n### Output: The question statement had read: Why I want? Choices: 1. be more creative 2. do more research 3. get a job in an advertising company 4. be a better photographer 5. improve skills\n \nRationales:1. The options given are only related with the answer if it is related to doing something.\n2. All the options are related to the activities that can be executed if you want to improve something.\n3.

Additionally, he is asking for his help with the knowledge that he is a good worker. This might imply that he values the accountant and trusts him with work which is why he can ask him to stay overtime. In the choice B (get the accountant's opion on a matter), he might just think he has an opinion he wants to share, which might mean he lacks trust on him and doesn\u2019t want to burden him with work.\n\nThe choices A (get more work done), C (impress him), and D (work with him as a team) cannot be inferred if the boss trusts the accountant or does not trust him just by the bode\u2019s actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer choice that is the best match is option E (get the accountant\u2019s opinion as a team), as it aligns with the bode\u2019s intention. \n\nSo, the answer is answer choice E (get the accountants' opinion as a team).\n\nAnswer: E: get the accountant\u2019s \n\n### Input Choices:A supervisor was asked to attend a project meeting.

Choices like excitment and wonder might be indirectly related to boredom.\n4. Therefore, curiosity is ruled out immediately.\n5.

But, the best fitting choice is C: go to the Doctor, as this option clearly explains his headache issues and the best way to cure it.\n5. Furthermore, to rule out other choices, the scientist probably does not want to learn math, as it requires mental exertion.\n6. Also, there's no chance he would be excited to see a doctor because it's tedious and time-consuming.\n7.

Among the given choices in the answer, \"hand\" doesn't belong by its definition as a single or part of the hand.\n6. Likewise, \"jars and all faces\" isn't a single or a part of a face.\n7. Because, \"All\" is plural that doesn't align with how single body parts are denoted.\n8. Thus, the only choice that fits the meaning of the question's context is E: Human face.\nAnswer: E:\\> Human face\n\n### Input : 43.60\n\n### Response : 6x17\n\n### Input\n```\nFoxtail and cotton lily are all ____ and _____, where _____, ______,and ______ are their members.\n```\n\n### Question Rationale:\n1. The blank spaces in the question has a hyphen to indicate that they can take two terms.\n2. Thus, if you add another term which adds a comma followed by a list of three terms, the term \"all\" can be eliminated as it does not make sense.\n3. Also, \"_____ and _____, where_____, __________and___________ are their member\" adds a comma which indicates a 4th term if not eliminated it would render the sentence a bit unclear.\n4. The terms cotton lily and foxtail take hyphen to indicate they are related.\n5. But foxtail is not a full term. It is just related to lily. So they are both \"lily\" and not cotton lily.\n6. Therefore, the possible ways the sentence can be rewritten is :\n7. lily is all ___________ and lily where ____________________,__________and_______________are its members\n8.

{"text": "Input: A scientist is searching the data with the hope that the results will help him understand what happened.\n\n#### Justification 1:\nThe question statement mentions that the scientist is searching the results with the hope that the result will help him understand what had happened.\n\nFrom the previous question, we already know what does the scientist is expected to do with his results, that is by gaining a better understanding.\n\nSo, we can interpret the question statement that the scientist is trying to understand what had happened which can be easily done by analysing the results.\n\nFrom the available choices, only the choices \"not fat\" and \"look first\" do not align with the scientist expectation to understand what had happened. So, their choices can be easily dismissed.\n\nThe answers of the remaining choices \"have legs,\" \"skip,\" and \"not fat\" are not in line with the scientist intention of understanding what had happened.\nSo, the remaining option that best matches the scientist intention or expectation is the choice \"look\".\n\nThe only option that is relevant to the scientist intention is \"look\".\n\n*So, the answer is A: look*\n\n### Input : In what direction does the cat headed?Choices:  A: the left B: the right C: up/down D: east/west E: east/west\n\n### Response\nInput: A cat headed for the east.\n\n#### Justifications:\n1. From the previous question, we know that a cat was heading somewhere.\n2. The question statement tells us that it is facing the east.\n3. According to the question statement, if the cat was headed for the left, then it would be facing the west.\n\nThus, options A and B are discarded, options D and E which say east/west are acceptable answers.\n\nThe only direct answer that matches the question statement is option D which says that the cat headed for the west.\n\nSo, the answer would be C: up/down\n\n### Instructions:Write the given response(s).\n### Demonstraion:\nInput : Write the name of person who won the race.

Thus, it can be understood that the respondent will choose that option for better readability and less ambiguity.\n5. Thus, the choice that makes it simple for the respondent is E: kids over the counter.\n\n### Input:(I'm feeling) dizzy Choices: A: ill B: nauseous C: cracks me up D: sick E: exhausted\n\n### Response:(I'm feeling)____.\n\n### Demosrtaion:\n1. The context of the question is about somebody feeling dizzy.\n2. From the options given, the response should be relevant to the context.\n3.

Among the choices, \"neatness\" means that greasy teens need to be clean, but greasy teens already need to be clean.\n2. \"selfishness\" means that grease teens are greedy/self centered, but greasy teen already need to be clean so selfishness cannot be the reason for this.\n3. \"mistakes\" is related, but it doesn't seem to be the correct one.\n4. \"cleaniness\" as an option is also not correct.\n5. Therefore, the only appropriate option is \"satisfaction,\" which matches with the requirement of being clean so it is the right option to be chosen.\n\n### Answer:\nGrooming is recommended to greasy teen because they are not satisfied about their personal hygiene and want to improve that.\n\n### Input:'What does a flawless complexion mean to you?'Choices:  A:`beautiful` B: `magnificent` C: `elegant` D: `perfect` E:`alluring`\n\n### Rationale\nThe question asks \"What does a flawlessly complexion mean to you?\"\n\n### Answer\nThe answer is D: Perfect.\n\n### Response\nThe question asks, \"What does a fawless complexion mean to me?\"\n\n### Rationeles\n1. 'beautiful' is an adjective so it doesn't seem applicable to the question.\n2. 'Magnificent' is also an adjective but it cannot be applied here because it is ambiguous.\n3. 'Elegant' is an adjective and its definition does not match with the meaning of complexion.\n4. 'Perfect' is also a word that denotes a quality and meaning of complexion. So, it is the most appropriate answer.\n\n\n\n### Input:`There is a new beauty line specifically designed for older women. `Choices:  A: `wonderful` B: `amazing` C: `exceptional` D: `amazing\nE: `unique`\n\n### Response A:\nThe given question is a statement that says \"There is a new", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}

{"text": "### Description:\nThe question asks about the feeling the dog had in the house even though it seemed small. It is implied that even though it did not go to a big house, it still felt like it belongs indoors. Based on this information, the dog was content in the house despite its limited space. This is the best answer.\n\n### Discussion:\nEven if a person lives in a big house, he cannot be content with the space around him. What matters most to him is how he can get involved with other people and what opportunities he can explore. This is also true with the dog. The dog is feeling content because despite its small space, it had the opportunity to interact with its owner and other human beings in the house. The question statement does provide enough information to infer that despite the dog's feeling of the house being a small space, it still had all the space in a world. To support the best answer, the dog might have had a huge yard to play in but it cannot fully explore the outside world. Besides, the dog is not allowed to go out of the house which limits the dog's opportunity to live in a big house. This information is not found in the statement but can be inferred.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe possible answers, A-E were selected randomly. Each possible answer was compared with the statements provided in the question. It is shown that each answer is either directly or indirectly related to any statement found in the question. \n\n### Detailed analysis of possible answer choices:\n\n1.\"A.

Dog park\" doesn't align to the possible questions. The dog does not usually stay in the dog park. However, it is the owner's duty to keep the dog safe from other animals which made the dog feel that it had all the space within the house. \n3. \"C. Basket\" can be related to this question because the dog is usually placed in a basket. However, the dog does not fully stay in the basket. Sometimes, it goes to the dog house, it interacts with other people and it explores the outside the house. The dog does not stay fully in the basket which means that there are other places the", "answer": "E: big house"}

A biologist is a scientist who researches in the field of biology.\n2. In the question statement, it is not clear if the given statements were written by a biologist.\n3. However, looking at the description of the scientist in the given statement, it can be concluded that the given statement is not written by a biologist because the given statement cannot fully determine if the statements are true and are relevant when referring to biology as the field of study under biology.\n4. Therefore, the statement \"Is the given statement written of a biologist?\" is false.\n\n```\n- The input:Are the given statements true or false?\n\n- Demotion:Not all birds can fly, but those who can fly can't see on the ground.\n\n- True or false\n\n- Demo:\n  If all birds can fly, then those who can fly can see, this is evident and known by anyone with an awareness of birds and birds' nature.", "answer": "B: hospital"}

{"text": "The correct answer is B, as the question sentence says Glass that hasn't (and is not known to have been) treated to be extra strong, is __________.\n\n### Response rationale:\n1. The word that must be filled in the blank should be an option that makes both the conditions \"HAS NOT BEEN\" (meaning: not treated) and \"is what\" (meaning: GLASS) satisfied.\n2. \"Regular\" can be ruled out because regular in the sentence means that the GLASS has not been treated to be EXTRA strong. Thus, if it is regular means, it has been treated to be regular and not EXTRA strong.\n3. The same holds true for \"forceless,\" as it means that the glass has not been treated to make it Forceless, while the question says that it has not been treated to BE EXTRA strong. Therefore, \"forceless\" is out of the options.\n4. Since GLASS is what's left, we can eliminate \"WEAK\" and \"FLAMISH\", as they do not align with the idea of not being treated to make it strong and the question does not mention fragility.\n5.

The question statement states that a study found that a person who listens to music is smarter, not dumber.\n2. Thus, the answer choice \"A: that people who are marry (sic) have children more often than not\" is not in line with the premise of the study that has been found. \"Children\" is the opposite of \"music\" and \"smarter.\"\n3.

So \"open-minded\" is ruled out.\n7. \"dumb (A)\" vs. \"teens smarter,\" so \"A: that people\" (indirectly related) can be ruled out.

The first group contains \"boredom\", \"patience\" and \"time\". These all refer to the execution of schooling. One needs to put up with them to instruct the children properly. The second group contains \"inspiration\". It refers to the motivating the children to give a better performance.\n\nThe instruction states that one would have to be patient enough to execute school. This does not match the instruction of \"properly instruct\". Also inspiring children is not required to \"properly instruct\" children, it is required to motivate children at a given point. As a counter claim, consider this example where the children were not listening in any of the classes. In that case we would have had to be patient enough and that would have resulted in the children not being properly instructed. This might also include making sure that a child is not bored or under-challenged. \n**The answers:**\n\nThus, the correct answer should make sure the children do not bore or under-challenge.

Choices:  A. makes the brain more active B. creates a sense of achievement C. makes us more aware D. feels like being in charge E. makes us feel more capable\n\n### Response:(Referring to the image of the multiple choice question)\n\n1. \"Empowering\" is the correct answer choice, however, the image does not explain a specific instance in which learning with this method is applied. 2. So, to arrive at the correct answer choice it is necessary to examine the context given and how it relates to the choices presented.\n\nAs per the context, there are five choices to pick from. Each choice has its own specific context, and for that, the answer is specific for each choice. Since the image gives us only one choice, it is not possible to decide among the five choices.\n\nThe only way is to take all the five choices into consideration and ask ourselves, \"Am I being empowered after learning?\" to decide on the correct answer choice.

Every option in the context presents a different scenario for learning. For example, B. says that when applied, \"Creating a sense of achievement\" means that the feeling of learning something useful remains, whereas when learning with Empowering means that you are challenged to be better with your understanding. But the feeling of challenge only matters if it challenges you to be effective.\n2.

Rationales: 1 If the party has been cancelled for the whole night, the hosts wouldn't be doing anything at all. But, they have been described in the question statement as taking selfies. So, clearly the description of the host doesn't match in this regard.\n2. 3. If they were really angry, they wouldn't engage in nothing at all.\n\n3. 4 & 5 There is no mention of a host being angry about his friends in the question statement.

So, among the choices provided, \"B\" being tired is the most suitable choice. If the hosts were really sleeping, this option won't be available.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. \"D\" mentions a \"nothing\" that does not match the statement saying that they would've done something else.\n2. Similarly, \"C\" mentions \"getting angry\" which does not match the description given in the question statement.\n3. \"A\" and \"E\" do not match with \"taking selfies\" in the end.\n\n4.

But, it is not considered injurious.\n2. Moreover, these professionals might get injured during games, resulting in the postponement or cancellation of competitions.\n3. However, injuries during competition are severe and may even have detrimental consequences like long recovery periods and sometimes death.\n4. That is why people involved in sports can't sustain injuries to compete anymore.\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is D: injuries.\n\n### Input.\n\nThe new device is so compact, the scientists were able to ______.\nA: create B: invent C: think D: decide E: develop\n\n### Demostration:\n\n1. The question states that a new device is compact, so it is likely that it will be an innovative one.\n2. The word create is similar to the word \"develop.\"\n3. However, the choice A: create is likely because the new device doesn't exist, so creating it is necessary.\n4. So, the correct answer is A: create.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. It is a matter of fact that the given sentence is about \"new and compact\" as per the sentence's context.\n2. Since it is new and compact, the answer should be regarding this feature, which aligns with the given feature of \"creation\".\n3. It is likely that the device does not exist, so it must be created.\n4. Therefore, it is D: invent.", "answer": "D: injuries"}

The question is asking what would I enjoy doing instead than going on the above two activities. The given options B,C,D, and E do not suggest something that is better suited than reading and watching movie with my friend. The first option A would suggest reading a book. This is the most befitting option because it is clearly an activity that is in a contrast to both reading and watching movies with a friend. If we add the last answer the most befitting answer, D,E would still be the same as in the prior options.\nIf the activity is to suggest something that I would enjoy performing instead of reading and watching movies then going into a bookstore or going for a walk is not an option. Reading a book is an option to enjoy performing, but the other choice B would suggest doing the second activity i.e. talking to my friends by phone and option E which is again watching a movie at home is also an option but the activity of talking by phone is not an option that would be an option that I enjoy performing.

The choices presented in the question are irrelevant to the motivation for singing. \"Insanity\" refers to a personality disorder or psychological disturbance characterized by abnormal thinking and behavior, including delusions and hallucinations. Therefore, it is unnecessary to consider this choice since it is not related to singing and the question is about the reason for singing. In addition, the choice \"to annoy people around\" refers to a deliberate act intended to bother or aggravate someone. This may be related to singing if the individual is deliberately singing in a way that bothers or irritates others. However, this question is about the reason or motivations for singing, not about annoying people.\n3. Choice \"to enjoy\" is the motivation of singing when it is done for enjoyment or pleasure. While this is a possible reason for singing, it may not be the only one or the reason given for the specific individual being asked about.\n4. \"For exercise\" doesn't make sense in this context. It's not the goal of singing nor the means of singing; therefore, it's unnecessary to consider it.\n5. \"To hunt better\" doesn't make any sense in this context.\n6. \"For music\" is a possible reason for the individual to sing, but this is not the sole one or the only motivation mentioned during the inquiry.\n7.

{"text": "Rationales:\n1. The statement has the keyword 'Northern Norway' which is used interchangeably with Polar Nights.\n2. Since the 'polar nights' are half marathons, it should happen in a city in Northern Norway.\n3. The Northern lights oval is an observatory. The question states \"which city is it?\" which indicates that it is a city.\n4. The last clause, \"located in the middle of the the northern lights oval\", reinforces that the given city is in Northern Norway.\n5. Therefore, the most direct answer is C: Troms\u00f8.\n6. The other cities mentioned are not direct match, their locations, such as 'Finmark' and 'vadso' are in Norway but not in the middle of polar northern lights oval.\n7. Also, all the cities mentioned in the question, with the exception of 'troms\u00f8', start with the letter 'N', but in the answer, the first letter is 'C'.\n8.

A: social B: gaggle C: herd D: pod E: flock F: school\n\n### Response :\nRationales:1. The word \"group\" implies that the word is either singular or plural.\n2. Therefore, the options which have single letter in \"group of people\" should be eliminated.\n3. Though \"school\" starts with a \"s\", its plural form is \"schools\", unlike any of the options.\n4. Since the word is used for a group of people in school, the word has to be singular. Among the remaining options, \"school\" and \"flock\" are the closest matches based on their usage i.e being used to describe a school group of people.\n5.

So, the choice (A), the man does not have the tenacity, to keep something in position.\n\n##### choice(B) hands.\nAs evident, from the first sentence, the man did not even have an item to set the cup on; thus the choice (B) man does not have the hands to balance the cup.\n\n##### (choice (C) Coaster:\nSimilar to the first sentence, the second one also states clearly that the man lacked an item to set the Cup on. Also, he was not able to use his coaster to balance the cup.

The answer to this scenario must satisfy the requirement of the instruction that asks about the \"great place to lay in the the sun.\"\n2. To be the best answer, it should be the closest and not too difficult to find.\n3. Beans are a word for people to say when in the sun, so it must be far away from that.\n4. The question does not require someone to say where it is great to lay in the sun, but it has been implied, but not explicitly stated.\n5. Therefore, the closest choice to that is West and the one that it is not too hard because people would rather be in it than in the beans.\n6.

{"text": "Rational for each option from high to low score.\n1. Illiterate - A person is illiterate or is unable to read, write, speak, and understand another language is usually unable to earn anything. So, being literate or well-educated is necessary for earning and fulfilling ones needs. So, if a person is illiterate, he is unable to gain knowledge and this cannot be considered to be well-educated. Thus, option A is not the correct answer.\n2. Knowledgeable - Knowledge in some contexts denotes having gained information on a subject. So, if a knowledgeable person has gained information on a subject, such as the science, he can use his knowledge to earn a good living, or meet his expectations. He can even share his knowledge among fellow beings to help them gain understanding. So, being knowledgeable is a key to a good living and fulfilling of needs. Thus, option B is most befitting and correct answer.\n3. To own house - Every person in this world has to fulfill his basic needs for his survival. These basic needs may include food, clothing, and shelter. House is a shelter for living; to own a house is to have a place to live in. If a person is unable to earn a house, he cannot earn anything at all. This is because shelter is a pre-requisite for survival. Apart from shelter, there are other necessities that should or could be fulfilled by house, such as room to live in, room to learn, room to share and so on. If a person cannot earn a house, then he is unable to fulfill even his basic need regarding shelter. So, owning a house denotes having fulfilled needs regarding shelter and fulfilling at least one basic need (though not all basic needs). So, if a person doesn't satisfy this criterion, is he well-educated? Well, no. A person should gain knowledge and ability to learn before even considering earning a house. It is necessary to learn in order to gain abilities. So, in order to fulfill basic (and not just basic) needs, one should have a good amount of knowledge. So, owing a house or having a good house with adequate space to live in, live with fellow beings, and use them for earning, does not denote to be", "answer": "B: knowledgable"}

B: Code is always written to be reused. C: Code should be written to be reused as part of a class. D: Code should be written in an editor while using a debugger. E: Code should be written with a structured programming language.\n\n### Response\n\n#### Coding:\n1. Coding is not a part of object oriented programming.\n2. It's rather one of the parts of object oriented programming along with data abstraction, which is what the question asks for.\n3. Code is mostly written as programs that perform a function.\n4. When a class's code is written as source code, we obtain the object of the class, which will then be used as a representation of the thing that the class is designed for. \n5. The code of the class thus makes the source code more extensible and reusable.\n6. So C: code should be written to be used as part of a class is true for the object-oriented approach.\n\n#### Data Abstraction:\n1. Every part of an object-orientated program should be abstract, as it helps to conceal data to only give out important information about objects and let only one function be implemented for all instances.\n2. So B: code is always written to be used as a function can also be true.\n3.

Let's take a look at each of these 5 options:\n\nOption A:\n\n* **Appreciation of Nature**. Some people are more interested in animals than in people. Some people are more scientific-minded than others. We all have a different way of seeing the world, including how natural and human elements come together. For example, if you're a very spiritual person, then you might see nature as a place that gives you peace and brings you closer to the Creator or God. If you're a math person (like me), then you might find beauty and wonder in numbers. Or, maybe you think of it as just a place where we can get some fresh air and exercise. Whatever your interpretation is, I think we can all agree that nature can bring out our best traits and inspire us to be better people.\n\nOption B:\n\n* **Education**. When you go to school, you learn new things about what matters most to you. You become more educated on the topic. Your views might change once you begin researching something new. You might start looking at old things differently now that you know more about them \u2014 like how much we eat affects our health, or that many diseases are caused by pollution. Knowledge is power!\n\nOption C:\n\n* **Excitement**. Some people become excited about learning and growing and sharing their newly acquired knowledge! Other people get angry or discouraged. Maybe they don't understand it themselves and think they shouldn't believe everyone else who does. The important thing to remember here is that most people will be more interested in what they perceive to be true rather than what other people think. So, if you're truly interested in learning, this shouldn't stop you from doing so.\n\nOption D:\n\n* **Increased Knowledge**. Once you gain knowledge, you'll be able to see the world and its many facets better. With this knowledge, you can now make more informed decisions regarding yourself and those around you. \ud83d\ude3b  \n\nOption E:\n\n* **See Things Differently**.

{"text": "C: mississippi\n#### Explanation:\n1. This question does not require computation, it needs a response based on information from the question.\n2. The word \"with\" was used to hint that there could exist other choices besides \"governor's office.\" In this case, \"other choice\" could mean \"the governor's office in a different location.\"\n3. Jackson could refer to a governmental office like Jackson, MI or, Jackson, TN. It does not have to be associated with a state that's called\nJackson.\n4. For example, Jacksonville is a Jackson city that is located in Florida. In this case \"Jackson\" would refer to Jacksonville.\n5. So, the answer must be one of the other choices in which \"Jackson\" is associated with.\n6. We have a choice between \"jackson-MI,\" \"Jackson-TN,\" \"jackson-mississippi,\" and \"Jackson-wyoming.\"\n7. \"Jackson-MI\" would not be valid because \"MI\" stands for Michigan, which is the incorrect answer.\n8. Similarly, \"Jackson-wyomming\" would not be appropriate as \"wyoming\" is not on the list of valid states.\n9. \"Jackson-mississippi\" is the only matching choice that includes the state's name as part of the city's name.

To understand the expression written, we need to read it the way it's meant to be.\n6. It becomes a message: Hello! Here's my phone - number.\n7. The statement can be interpreted as follows: \"Hello!

{"text": "### Demostration:\nAnswer: E: judgement.\n### Rationale:\n1. In the question statement, the sentence \"the judge did not take this of the job lightly\" implies that the judge does not take lightly the decree he has, of sentencing a person to a particular punishment.\n2. The passage states that, \"it was the judge's passing sentence that condemned a man to death,\" which suggests that judging is one of the reasons for sentencing a person to death.\n3. Thus it gives more focus to the job \"judging.\"\n4. Judging here alludes to the judicial procedure of sentencing a person, and the process of judgement.\n5. Among all the given choices, \"incarceration,\" \"passing sentence,\" \"judging\" and \"condemning a man\" can be linked.\n6. Since, judging is the main reason for sentencing a person, the answer is \"Judgement.\"\n\n### Explanation:\n\n### \n### Input:In an attempt to save the planet, the scientists launched a series of programs to what? Choices A: clean up the environment B: conserve resources C: reduce the carbon footprint D: support global efforts\nRationales:1. The phrase \"In an attempt to save..\" suggests that there is a problem to fix.\n2. It is the primary job of the scientists to try and fix the problem by launching a series of programs.\n3. Therefore, the answer to this question is \"launching a series of programs.\"\n4. Among the other choices, \"clean up the environment\" does not align with the intent to fix the problem.\n5. \"Congrats..\" refers to the act of appreciating others, so it's not directly relevant in this context.\n6. Similarly, neither \"reduce carbon footprint\" nor \"support global efforts\" suit the context of fixing a problem.\n7. So, among the available choices, the answer is \"launching a set of programs.\"\n\n### Input\n```javascript\n( (function() {\n   var s = document.createElement('script'); s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.async = true; s.src = chrome.runtime.getURL('getRhetoricalQu", "answer": "D: death"}

{"text": "This was a multiple choice test. The answer should be correct and logical.\n### Rationales:1.

The question statement portends the princess tries her best to achieve independence, she's trying to attain that goal, she's hoping for a happy ending.\n2. The choice\" be independent\" can be ruled out for the reason that, it not synonymous with the expression \"happily enough after\" and also\"happily ever after\" suggests that a lady is wishing for something good to happen to her afterwards, or her efforts will always lead to something good.\n \n3.

The magic spell might be impossible to cast for the old witch, since there is no statement that that the old witch casted a magic spell. \n4.

The passage does not mention anything about any situation faced by the author and so the answer doesn't mention any specific time.\n2. The answer should provide clarity on whether a person feels better about their situation in the future by three or four years, as the passage doesn't ask or mention if they will feel better after four years and there is no context for the question and hence it should be answered as if the question had been about three years in the future.\n\n### Output: In the past people felt free but the poor man didn't.\n\n### Analysis: \"people\" is not mentioned, but the answer uses plural form to refer to \"people.\" In addition, this isn't the answer we want: the answer should only refer to what the man felt.

{"text": "D: drawer\n\n### Instructions:\nYour response will describe how a machine operates.\n\n### Description:This statement describes a machine.\n### Demontration:\nInput: A machine to clean clothes\nRationales: The word \"machine\" might confuse some of the respondents.\n1. That machine is supposed to clean clothes implies that the machine is an operational part of an appliance.\n2. It might have multiple moving and shifting parts inside from which the clothes need to be cleaned with detergent and warm water.\n3. \"The clothes\" are the input that is supposed to be cleaned by the machine, and the output is therefore a clean piece of clothing.\n4. Since the purpose of the machine, i.e. to clean clothes is fulfilled with the output of clean clothing, it means this machine operates to fulfill the task of \"cleaning clothes\" (Input in this case).\n5. Thus, this machine operates to carry out the task (or the purpose) of cleaning clothes (Input in this case) and the output is a clean piece of clothe.\n6. This implies that, in this scenario, the process is \"operating to fulfill the task.\"\n7.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nSample Solution: \nThe question statement mentions about a person Sam who has found a hole on the plain.\n\n1. So, he might believe the hole to be a \"mountain\" that is a very big hill.\n2. He might refer to that as a cliff because of its steep slope. On the other hand, a gorge is a wide deep and long valley.\n3. A sandplain has no steep slope or any height to it, hence it can't be a hole.\n4. If the hole is in sand, it can't be cliff because it lacks any slope.\n5. But, the cliff and a gorge, as both have a steep slope, might be considered by the reader for correctness.\n6. But the most reasonable choice is a \"giant hole\" or a big hole.\n\nAnswer: C: gorge\n\n#### Input:A survey was done in all the houses and the answer was a bit surprising. A: what?

{"text": "1. The word \"decide\" implied that there is a problem at hand for which you need to do something.\n2. Hence, the choice \"thinking\" doesn't make any sense because there is no way to deduce \"thinking\" would be required to decide a problem.\n3. Similarly, \"painful memories\" doesn't make sense because there is no use of memories (pleasant or unpleasant) when making a decision.\n4. A decision to be made is for something which inspires awe, thus, \"awesome inspiring\" is the correct choice.\n5. This leaves us with the choices: \"learning\" and\" pleasurable\" because these can make a decision pleasant or not, or learning and/or pleasurable memories which can make a decision pleasurable.\n6. But the choice which has been provided in the question is already \"pleasure\".\n7.

If you decide to gain a better understanding or learn more you have successfully gained/learned an understanding, therefore the question asks you to do something to make sure that lab was successful.\n2. So, the \"gain a better understanding\" and \"write a report\" are wrong answers as they are irrelevant.\n3. So the answer should be either \"make a decision\" or \"try new foods\".\n4. To make a decision you must have a proper understanding, you should then make a decision based on that understanding (so it must be that you gain a better understanding to be able to make a decision).\n5. Try new foods implies eating stuff, this can also be another way to gain a better understanding so a similar answer.\n6.

Choices:  O: a grocery store on campus P: a superstore around the corner from my house Q: a department store near my mall R: the spa I visited last week\n\n### Demostration:\n1. The choice O can be ruled out. First, the day at work is hectic which means that it was stressful. A supermarket might have the bubble bath, but it will not be as relaxing as the one in the spa.\n2. The location of the superstore is not stated so that it is not clear if it is nearby or far away. The department store is another option to find out what kind of stuff they sell there. But, the last option R can be easily ruled out because the spa should not sell the product, but rent it for free because otherwise, they will not be able to afford the bubble bath as a price of being relaxed there.\n3. It means that the question is asking us to choose between a grocery or a department store for buying the product. Let's assume that you are at work, that means that the nearest location is P, where you can buy groceries on a daily basis.\n\nBecause the choice Q can go with any kind of department, it is clear that it does not align with the statement of the option R, which clearly states that the bubble bath should not be purchased for the spa itself.

{"text": "The word for the question is disparagement. It means making criticisms that may damage someone's reputation, or bringing what could be considered discredit or insult on someone's reputation.  [Definition from Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disparagement)\n\n\n### Input\nI was once interviewed by one of my heroes, a world-renowned artist who had inspired me deeply for many years and whose works I had long admired.  When the interview came to an end, one thing I said to him before I turned to leave the room was:\n\u201cIt is so inspiring to meet someone who is so far above the crowd. You set such a good example for young artists!\u201d\n\n### Response\nThe answer is E: uncertainty. The above statement means the interviewee is describing the artist's behavior to be uncertain.  There is nothing in the statement that explicitly mentions disparaging.  In fact, the interviewee admits to being inspired by the artist.  The word \"uncertain\" is an adverb to the sentence, because the adjective would be \"uncertain\" and the noun would be \"uncertainty.\"  Here is the dictionary definition of \"uncertain.\"\n\"lacking confidence, not sure of what to do.\"(Source: Dictionary.com)\n\nThe other options, are all related to the word \"disparaging\" as in the example provided.  They are:  A: Ignoring, B: Being Rude, C: Disparagement, D: Contumely.\n\nIgnoring is the omission of something deliberate.  This is different from uncertainty in that uncertainty means uncertainty, and it is not deliberate to be uncertain.  Being rude has also been ruled out by the fact that the interviewer and interviewee were able to have a conversation, and were both praising the same persons behavior.  Disparagement is not the same as uncertainty.  Disparagement means damaging or insulting.  Contumely means causing public ridicule or public disgrace.\n\n\n### Instructions\nAnswer the two questions below.

What I do before going to party is to arrange my priorities. I always check the party invitation carefully and make sure to bring only what I really need to attend the party (to avoid carrying too many things). I also check the attire and ask other party guests to check my outfit. I never ignore the party theme and choose things accordingly. I also check if the party place is within my safety and comfort zone (in terms of distance and mobility). Moreover, if there is transportation to attend the party. I take time to consider if the mode of transport is comfortable and if it suits my need. In short, my priorities are on:\n1. checking things that I need to attend the party,\n2. checking out what I should wear at the party, and\n3. getting to comfortable and safe place (in terms of mobility and transportation).\nAfter this, I can now enjoy the party without any worries.\n[Reference](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/questions-questions-4.htm )\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer what you feel about the movie below.

{"text": "This question asks about the mind's activity during sleep. Among the given choices:\n\n1. \"Snoring\" refers to one's throat vibrations.\n2. \"Talking\" describes what a person can do while asleep.\n3. \"Getting cold\" does not reflect the thoughts or activities that happen inside the mind.\n4. \"Nothing\" is a logical choice.\n5. But, \"might dream\" best serves the question's statement because it implies that dreams are not 100% possible.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. A snore is a sound produced during sleep when a person's throat vibes during inhalation, while talking refers to verbal communication.\n2. Getting cold during sleep is also unusual, but it's not the primary focus\n3. Meanwhile, nothing pertains to non-verbal reactions (e.g. a person shivers).\n4.

{"text": "### InputThe audience at a hockey game could be very loud, but most of the noise would come from the spectators themselves. Movies typically involve a loud audience, however, unlike with sports or a live theatre show.\n\n### Response The audience of a hockey game are very noisy. They can be loud especially when there has been a goal, and a crowd cheer ensues. They would be loud from their cheering, shouting, and also the noise from the hockey players, the equipment, and the puck. These noises create a louder, crowded atmosphere.\n\n### What other sports have a rowdy, noisy crowd?\n\n### A hockey game could also be seen in movies, such as the hockey scene in Miracle where they practice the shootout.\n\n### The audience in a hockey game is noisiest when something loud will happen. There would also be noise from the hockey players and the stadium equipment.

(We need money to pay the rent, not to pay for the house.

If an employment is given, then it will lead to a better understanding of what the sentences are seeking to provide\n\n### Option C:\n\nChoice: C: income\n\nBecause although you might earn money if your salary allows you, it is not guaranteed. However, employment guarantees a steady income. Besides, it is more beneficial if a job is an opportunity that provides a better understanding than anything but no matter how hard you work, if it does not lead to anything, you have lost nothing, but you might have gained an experience which would be better.

Thus option C can be the correct answer as he is giving an update.\n7. Option D: Resting because the manager might be resting to get some energy to cope up with the situation.\n8. However, the manager has already tried to reboot the machine for two times, he is not at rest but his problem is yet to be resolved.\n9. Thus option E- Fixing the computer can be the correct answer.\n10. Since he was given update of the situation he must have got some suggestion to fix this computer.\n11.

{"text": "The answer choice \"E: surface of earth\" is incorrect.\n\nThe answer options \"charming\", \"space shuttle\", \"house\", and \"train station\" can be ruled out because they do not describe breathable places.\nIt is important to note that the answer cannot simply indicate places frequented by many people or places where there is much activity, but rather places or environments where previous breathing has occurred.\n\nFor example, a train station is heavily traversed, but people would not be breathing there. Other places where breathing may occur but could be ruled out for this question include a stadium, a bus, or a car.\n\nThe remaining answer option (\"surface of earth\") is the most appropriate because it is a large, uninhabited area where people do breathe during their lives.\n\nThe question asks about a breathed surface, and it is not intended to describe breathable air in general.\n\nThis answer is incorrect because it focuses on a type of air that can be breathed and not on the previous breath.\n\n### Explanation:\nA breathed surface is a defined area where air has been breathed by others.\n\nThe other answer choices can be ruled out because there is no implication of previous breath in them.\n\nRuling out the aforementioned answer options shows the need to choose the question's most directly related answer choice.\n\nIn terms of correctness and logical reasoning, \"surface of earth\" could be the best answer.\n\n### Input and output questions have a lot in common in that the process starts with a question and answer pair.\n\n### The process for answering input-output questions often involves an inductive step, during which many possible answers are generated for each question and then whittled down with tests, such as the verification step.", "answer": "D: train station"}

{"text": "Rationales:1. The option choice E: neighbor's garage is the most logical choice among the given options because the sentence specifically stated that the person is unhappy or angry with the car.\n2. Therefore, they might get mad enough to take it to a place away from their house and far from their sight.\n3. This idea is akin to driving the car to another location or hiding it.\n4. So, this option would be an extreme way to avoid the problems associated with their car.\n5. Among the remaining choices, a person who's happy to take their car would do anything else other than taking it to a workshop or down a river.\n6. So, option E has an internal contextual contradiction and would contradict the statement if it is accepted.\n7.

In 1994, a telecommunications company launched 'Free Call' to send pictures between 9003 and 9006.\n3. So, it cannot be \"How to make a cup of tea\" or \"the Big Bang Theory.\"\n4. Similarly, the \"God of small things\" is not a video broadcast and \"The Beatles live show\" only started in 1962, after video cameras were invented.\n5. Therefore, the only choice that makes sense is \"the first video broadcast was in the 1990s\" - the British Open snooker!\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Instructions: Answer questions 1 to 5.

{"text": "If I have a large party / social events I would have a reception in a restaurant because that is why you have a large hall in a restaurant where large parties such as wedding receptions can take place and is appropriate for a large party. It would not make sense to have it in a country club. We wouldn't want guests to be cramped (being in a country club would feel cramped) but also be in a large reception. So my answer is D: Large Reception. We don't need guests to go to a lobby when they arrive at the restaurant, the restaurant is a place for a party and for guests to celebrate. It can't fit many guests but we want to have a reception. Guests will need to be a reception in a restaurant not a lobby. We will need a large reception.

Data are a collection of values.\n2. Data means numbers or words, collected, processed and presented for various purposes.\n3.

Choices: 03%  B: 63% C: 55% D: 38% E: 44%\n\n\n### Answer D\n\nWhen we convert, we add percentage to 100 because of the denominator (100%). So, we have 22 / (35*100). That result must be divided to 100, so the result shall be multiplied with 100. Thus we have 22/38*100. Therefore, the result shall be converted to 100. 22 / (44*100) = 22/4400 =", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}

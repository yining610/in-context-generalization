As tests pass a developer’s implementation, the unit tests are being used to write specifications. These specifications, which are written by an outside party (in most cases a client), form the basis of the program that they wrote. Writing the tests before writing the code helps to eliminate the risk of writing code that is incomplete and does not meet the client’s expectations.<n><n>### Why Write New Code Before Writing Tests?<n><n>By writing code before the tests, it makes it easier for a developer who is unfamiliar with the code to create the tests against an existing implementation. Since tests are created before writing the code, there is much more information in the tests to help the developer to be successful in writing the code. The failure of the tests is used to identify where changes need to be made in the new implementation.<n><n>### Running Tests<n><n>At the end of each testing cycle, code tests are run automatically in most integrated development environments. While these automated tests are an indication of the current health of the application code, the main function of the test is to act as a specific specification that gives developers a clear idea of how their implementation was tested and by whom.<n><n>### Benefits of TDD<n><n>There are several benefits that come with writing tests before a developer writes code. The primary purpose of writing tests is to create specifications for how to write the code. In this way, the tests act as a template for code, guiding the developer towards the implementation desired by the client.<n><n>### Drawbacks of TDD<n><n>The primary drawback of TDD is that a

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:Where would someone likely bring an attache case? Choices:  A: overhead compartment B: chair C: hospital D: in shirt E: business meeting<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: A B: D C: E D: B E: C<n><n>### Submission: Submit your response as a comment.<n><n>Submission:<n>The answer to this question is "E" because: The place you want to keep an attache case is generally not in an over head compartment (unless you have one on the plane). You also wouldn't store the case at the airport because it's not common to bring a bag around the hospital, and you wouldn't store it at a business meeting because you are not going to be talking with anyone there. So the only answer left is B, D, or E. B) you wouldn't store the attache case in the overhead compartment. D) you wouldn't do it at a business meeting, because you aren't trying to keep your attache case there, so you wouldn't put it there. E) would be the best answer here, because it's a hospital (the question made 2 clear hints that this was the answer) and you would likely keep a purse or attache case at someone's house or at a hospital for a business meeting or in a hospital.<n>

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:A person writes a check to a clerk, where does the clerk put them? Choices:  A: cash register B: desk drawer C: pay envelope D: throw away E: box<n><n>### Response:		Answer Choice C<n><n>### Justification: Answer Choice C is correct because the person wrote the check with the intention of paying the company the same way they received the check at the clerk's desk drawer. After the clerk's cash register, the clerk receives a check from someone. The next step is for the clerk to bring a new check to give to the second person, because they will also pay the second person.<n><n>### Extra Response: This is a wrong answer. After a clerk receives a check, the clerk needs to get a receipt. After getting a receipt, we need to put the receipt in a register so that we can get money from the cash drawer, so we will be able to do that for the clerk.<n><n>### Clarification: When you receive a check, you need to give the clerk a receipt for payment. The next step is to record the payment in a register so that you can get the money from the cash register and so that the person who gave the payment can be notified.<n>

You would never wish to surround yourself with someone who was sad and depression  because if you're sad someone wants to make you happy. It is contagious and I feel like that goes for everyone and everyone's feeling of the world.<n><n>### Example:<n><n><n>## Question<n><n>How do you do?<n><n>Response<n><n>The person doing the request has asked you to respond to their question regarding what was done incorrectly or what could have been done better in the task.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:When eating everything on the tasting menu, what does one tend to feel? Choices:  A: full stomach B: getting full C: gaining weight D: sick E: satisfaction<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The correct answer was D.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n><n><n>### Hint:<n><n>During meal eating everything on the menu,  One may have to feel full.<n><n>### Test-driven development<n><n>### When I read the input 'full stomach' it immediately makes me think about feeling full, and how that could impact eating more food. This is probably my natural reaction to seeing that string of words, but it seems like it would just be normal to feel that way. A. Full Stomach<n><n>### In the second sentence, we say things like "One tends to _____". So if One is having the feeling of being full to eat more food, what emotion would they feel if they have not ate everything on the menu? <n><n>D. I might feel sick or sad or like I might vomit, since I know I ate enough for the time.<n><n>### If you knew you were feeling sick, wouldn't you want to go outside and get rid of the contents of your stomach? D. Sickness<n><n>### So since we would be sick from eating too much already, what would we be able to do with the food? Try out other recipes from the menu or if it was too much food, we could probably throw out or eat something else.<n><n>Since they would be sick, they might not think of getting food and trying other recipes. B. Getting Full<n><n>### If they were full, I would wonder if I should take something else even though I already ate everything on the list. Even though if you thought about it, it would not matter, because I would never be able to eat more in those circumstances.<n><n>Because when you eat food, you should always finish everything on the menu because you do not know how big the portions are. <n><n>### C.<n><n>### I do not think that someone who has everything on the menu is over-eating at this point. Unless this was like a taco stand or something else simple and unhealthy, they should not be throwing up or feeling sick. In addition to this, even when one is full, they are going to feel satisfied. After a while, if one is still feeling full they would want to stop eating because they can not handle more food.<n><n><n>###

Choices:  A: teach B: cost money C: do work D: be productive E: help people<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>  ### My Answer:  The correct answer is  A. <n>  ### My Rationale:  Cubicles have computers for employees to teach. <n><n>### Solution:<n><n> - I am using the ANSI C programming language that I have learned.<n> - After completing the required problem I looked at the first few lines of code and thought that it should be a simple problem with a simple solution.<n> - I was confused with the question since it had the letter A in it and it looked like one of the choices should have been true, not false.<n> - First I began to research what some programming languages allow in their program statements or not. It seems like the program statement was valid by my knowledge of programming and the ANSI C language.<n> - I thought about the question since it used the term what would the machines do instead of which did the computer teach. I began to think that the word what would just mean what they were supposed to teach even if it was not true.<n> - By reviewing similar multiple choice logic I found out that there was a possibility of picking what the computer could or what something could do instead of which it is or did happen.<n> - So I began to think of all of the possibilities for the problem then I found a solution for both parts of the question.<n>

Choices:  A: gas stations B: city C: london D: train station E: airport<n><n>### Response:		B <n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>**A:** This is a type of business that has a high number of phone to make calls from a phone, <n>it's because a gas station needs to communicate with its owner if something happens and to talk to customers and ask for them to buy the type of fuel that they have at their station and also they need phones to communicate with their supplier if they don't have a kind of fuel to keep them their business running smoothly and when customers call and ask if they sell a particular type of fuel and to tell them that it's unavailable.<n><n>**B:** The business that has a high numbers of telephone booths is a city business for example in london there are a lot of telephone booth in any spot, why? Because when it's a city the more buildings there are more people passing by and a lot of offices and buildings are using a lot of telephones to communicate with customers and people, a city is a big and busy place that doesn't have time to go to phone a place and wait for it to pick it up and call someone, you can see a lot of offices that has its own telephone booths to avoid this problem and that's why cities have a high number of phone booths.<n><n>**C:** There are more telephone in london because when you walk around the city you can see the telephone poles everywhere, and a lot of telephone number in those telephone poles. It's because london is a very big city with a lot of big buildings and businesses and they need to have a telephone to communicate with other big businesses inside the telephone poles and a lot of telephonic lines to communicate with other businesses and people in the telephonic lines because london is the biggest city in the world so you need to have a lot of telephone lines.<n><n>**D:** There are more phone boxes in a train station because there are a lot of people passing by and they can use it to call to someone in case of emergency or an urgen situation. When in a train it's hard to talk to someone on the phone when there's not a good connection in a train and train stations have special phone call lines to communicate to them stations.<n><n><n>### Output:Answer the following multiple-choice question:

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:Where will a bullet projectile be found during a war? Choices:  A: battle field B: museum C: weapon D: canon E: tornado<n><n>### Response:		<n>If A, then A is the right answer. Where will a bullet projectile most likely to be found during a war is the battlefield. The battlefield is where the battle occurs. Bullet projectiles are meant to break apart, fragment, and explode with force. As a reminder, a bullet is an item that is launched towards a target with the intent to hit. When a bullet has made contact with an alien or enemy and has broken, it is usually a dead body. There is a saying that goes, "the more a bullet has been exposed to the elements, the sharper it becomes." That saying pertains to the breakdown of a bullet that has seen so much time on the battlefield. Bullets on museum walls are extremely rare items. They were used to hunt large animals and are now used as collectibles. Bullet projectiles would likely end up in a weapon if they were given the chance to. There is nothing for them to fight against if they didn't have a specific target. Bullets do not know to go to a specific location. They are used as a way to hunt, protect, and keep people safe. Lastly, bullets are launched and do know where they are going to end up. They don't have minds of their own. So, this is my response to this question.<n><n>## Solution:See below <n><n>![Alt Text](https://github.com/AHerring423/Herrings-Project/blob/master/assets/Demonstration%201.png?raw=true)<n>

We should protect our bodies from any injury that may occur because sometimes we don’t know our actual injuries and the more we think about it, our injuries may become more. Curl to protect our bodies<n><n>### Extra credit:<n>A: leg B: garments C: torso D :body E: road<n>

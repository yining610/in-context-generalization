Select one of the four key ingredients to process the instruction.\n2. In this case, it was a noun phrase.\n### Response: \nAfter selecting the noun phrase 'a full stomach', this response examines each of the key words and determines the type of answer it would likely be asking for.\n\n### Processing:\n1. What words in the noun phrase 'full stomach' are we asked to identify? 'Stomach' has several potential meanings for which it can be used, so which one is being referenced here?\n   1. The noun phrase 'full' as an adjective modifying stomach refers to a state of being full or satisfied.\n   2. We can then choose a verb phrase that would follow 'full stomach', which indicates what the subject of the phrase would be, i.e. the feeling of satisfaction.\n   3. The question answer 'what does one tend to feel' points towards the verb phrase which would follow 'full stromach' which is likely to be 'feel'. \n### Question answer:\nThe final sentence of the instruction has two questions, one question which follows 'full stomach and its corresponding verb phrase 'tend to feel'. Based on the processing we performed.\nIt is likely that 'what does one tend (to feel)?' is the question that was meant to be answered with a noun phrase. The next sentence 'when eating everything on the menu' should then be interpreted as a new question which follows, and requires a noun phrase to be answered.\n### Question answer and noun phrase:\nLet's consider each of the given options to see which one best answers \"when eating everything on a tasting menu''. \n1. Choice 'A: full stomach: This doesn't make sense. A full stomach is a state of being full, and the word menu suggests that not all items have been eaten which would mean that the stomach wouldn't be full. \n2. Choice 'B: getting full: this is a process, not a state, and it wouldn't make sense to say that one gets getting", "answer": "B: getting full"}

They can be easily located in those places) \n\nThe best possible selection 'outdoors' makes us more apt to meet the 'demand' for these snakes.\n\n- Choice 'Outdoors' is the best choice because 'Outdoors' best aligns to the statement of too many people being the cause of them searching all around to be able to accommodate their demands.\n- Outdoors is what most of the snakes reside in. However, it does not give a clear indication as to why people want them because there are other reasons other than their exotic properties.\n- So option B: North America refers to too much demand that it even drives most people to move to the country in which snakes are located to keep themselves with the snakes.\n- Choice D: Pet Shops refers the place where most of the exotic snakes are located.\n- However, the statement is not on an exotic snakes, they are only known to move around a lot due to their exotic status.\n\n### Input\nThe students, which had been in his class, told him that they didn't learn well.

However, it's quite vague. It's not clear what type of crop was known or referred to, so we can remove those options completely. The question also doesn'\"'t provide a clear indication of what was produced in the last decade.\nTherefore, there are many options that all answer the question; however, these are all incredibly unlikely given the context of the question.\nThe phrase \"known for its production in the past decade\" suggests that the crop is no longer being produced, but rather that it was a production that the city cemented fame for in that time period. One of the top 4 cities that produce the most amount of crops/products is Paris, so we have a high probability that the city we know is Paris.\n\nTherefore, the 4 remaining choices are eliminated because they don't fit the context of this question. Paris is referred to as \"The city of Light\" due to its past popularity with romanticism. There are four correct answers, each of which refers to Paris from a different context.\n\nHowever, all of these answers can be considered a \"saving grace\" answer, so this question would not be accepted in the real SAT.\n\n### Response Explanation\nI picked the following options because it clearly indicated that the answer was Paris.

Choices: \tA: of how to do the work B: to show how to do it C: to show how to show the work D: to show how to not do the work E: to do the work\n\n### Rationales:\nA 'barn' is a structure made of wood and used for housing livestock. This does not suggest that'skills' or 'experience' were demonstrated or'shown' in reference to the given sentence.\n\nB 'building,' and C 'building', are both also just structures made of bricks and concrete. There is no way to tell from the description of these buildings given in the question if experience or skills were demonstrated in performing this task.\n\nD 'garage', is a structure that is often used to perform and store vehicles. It is possible that experience or skills were demonstrated or shown when performing the requested task. However, the word 'garage' is only a structure; it does not suggest any type of performance that could demonstrate experience or skills in performing this task. It is thus not likely the correct answer; in fact, this one of the most commonly-chosen wrong answers.\n\nE'synagogue,' is a structure that might be found inside a 'barn,' 'building,' or 'garage.' However, since it was not mentioned in the question, we cannot determine if it is the correct word.\n\nTherefore, based on reasoning, the answer is probably not any of the other options. Let's consider the options again.\n\nWe now have to determine which option is the best answer to the question, which is the option that matches the intended meaning of 'demonstration.' Looking closely at each option, we can narrow the possibilities to B, C and D. There is no mention that the 'demonstration' was performed inside the 'barn,' this means that the demonstration was done outside the 'barn.\n\nWe can discount 'building' since there is an explicit mention of a 'garage,' and as the answer choice does not indicate a barn, building is probably not the answer.\n\nIt's not clear exactly where the 'demonstratioin' was done, but it was done 'inside' the 'building', which also means it was outside the building, as a place can not be inside and outside by definition.", "answer": "A: demonstration"}

This is why it is not disturbed by sunlight.\n\nRationale: We can assume that the answer will describe a place where a fungus can grow away from sunlight because we already know that a fungus would grow underground (not necessarily on a person's toes). \nHowever, we can also assume that the answer will _not_ be a place where the fungus grows on something else or is disturbed by sunlight because the question is asking where it can grow and _not_ be disturbed by sun.\n\nInput: What is your response to this issue? Choices:  B: agree with me C: disagree with me D: let me know E: let me know please F: give me information\n\nRationales: Let's analyze each option one by one.\n\n1. The word issue is used here in the context of debate and discussion.\n2. A participant in such a debate or discussion might express a variety of sentiments, including agreements and disagreements.\n3. Hence, the first option is \"agree with me\".\n4. The second option \"disagree with me\" doesn't make sense as the answer to an issue as such disagreement would be a part of the issue, it is not the whole answer.\n5. The third option \"let me know\" also doesn't make sense. We are not the issue, we are the people expressing our viewpoints about it.\n6. Hence, we are left with the fourth option \"let me know please\" as the logical answer here.\n\nInput: Where to place an object to keep it safe? Choices:  C: under the bed  D: outside of house E: in the garage  F: on the ground\n\nRationales:(1). 'Under the bed' and 'on the ground' are both places to keep something safe. So the answer could be either one.\n(2). The location 'Outside the house' won't necessarily keep something safe so it is not the option.(3). The location 'Garage' is actually a place to store things, it won't necessarily keep the object safe from damage. (4).

{"text": "C: happyness\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The question asks about a feeling that is usually experienced through sex, not just in general. \n2. For an answer to be a good fit, it must align with the stated question. \n3. In this question, the stated feeling is \"happyness\" (lowercase intentional) which is not a real word, making options A-E incorrect.\n4. The key words align with the answer option C: happyness. \n5. This word combination is found in the dictionary and is used to describe a feeling that is commonly experienced through sex. \n6. Another important clue here is that the word \"happyness,\" while misspelled, includes the word \"ness,\" which is often used to connect descriptive words to the word that they are describing (ex. happiness). \n7. As the question refers to a \"feeling,\" we only need to look at the options that refer to feelings. \n8. Since all of the other options do not contain the word \"happiness\" (the correct feeling to align with the question), our answer is C: happyness (lowercase, intentional in this question).\n\n### Response\nB: burn hot\n\n### Instuction:\nWhat might you use to remove dampness from a place?\n\n### Exploration:\nLet's break down each option A: burn hot, B: dampness, C: burn Hot, D: Dampness, E: water\nRationales:\n1.

For the word \"burn\", we need to look up the definition.\n4. The word \"dampness\" itself is vague, as it could be either the state of it (e.g. it's getting damp) or the place where it is (e.g. a room that is damp). We can eliminate this option as it is not the place that should removed the \"dampness\".\n5. We have narrowed our options to either A or C, which is already a", "answer": "B: feel good"}

A: Lack of sleep B: Exposures to stress C: The teacher D: Preparedness of a student E: Fear of unsuccess E: Preparedness Rationales:\n1. We can eliminate the other options because they may not be applicable to the given situation.\n2. The most likely cause will be the teacher for three reasons:\n3. A teacher can be a source of stress especially if the teacher does not have enough experience.\n4. Many teachers have a bad habit of saying or doing stupid things.\n5. Teachers tend to be perfectionists and that would cause some stress. \n6. An example of perfectionist would be to a point that they would keep insisting on getting perfect scores and if students do not meet that expectation, the teacher would become annoying and the students cannot calm him down.\n7. In this way, preparedness does not eliminate students from getting nervous if they are forced to work with a teacher especially after that teacher has given some assignments and the deadline are near.\n8. The last option, Preparedness would be applicable if the teacher is always ready in his or her lessons that may help in reducing stress.\n9. A would be an incorrect answer for three distinct reasons.\n\n### Response (A):\nCorrect answer and explanation.\n1. Lack of sleep would affect the student, but not cause it since he already knows what to do. A would cause nervousness to happen since the kid would feel the effects of being hungry or the opposite, being too much on energy. Since sleep is important, Lack of sleep would definitely cause student to be tensed and nervous which may not be favorable among them.\n2. Exposures to stress would make student feel stressed. It might be related to the subject but most likely the teacher is the subject that would cause exposure to stress.\n3.

The sentence starts out telling us that the company was doing great.\n2. This indicates that it was prospering or progressing, so we need to choose a noun that refers the company's success and positive state.\n3. Let us analyze each choice in turn:\n4. Choice A, an \"incentive\", is a noun that refers a benefit offered in order to encourage someone to do an action or achieve something. However, it is not common to say that the company had an incentive, instead it would be more common that the company has an incentive program or package.\n5. Choice B, a \"disadvantage\", is a noun used to describe something that is detrimental or adverse. This does not align with what the sentence is saying about the company's fortune so elimination is necessary.\n6. Choice C, \"opportunity\", is a noun referring to a favorable situation, specifically a chance or a possibility. However, we need a word that refers directly to the company's success.\n7.

{"text": "Input: They moved out of the city **to** have a master bedroom\nIMPORTANT!!\nThe word to indicates movement, it's a preposition, however when one is following a preposition the other parts of the sentence is affected by it.\n\nThe word **to\u201d** modifies another word in the same sentence or clause it is attached to. \n\nThe most common application of \"to\" with verbs is to express movement. An instance of such usage is in its use with \"move\". The \"the\" in the sentence doesn't alter the meaning of the sentence, it's a determiner, it indicates possession, it's a determinant. The sentence means they moved out of the city.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nThe sentence refers to a house, hence we need to relate the house to something. So we try to infer the meaning of the sentence based on the given answer options.\n\nThe word \"A: large house\". We know that a house is a home, so \"large house\" is a large home, it is the same as saying large home = large house. The word \"large\" doesn't indicate movement, hence the preposition \"to\" is not followed the verb moved. So B and C are eliminated.\n\nThe answer is A: large house\n\nThe word large means \"huge\", and so does the house = house - huge, means the house is huge. Huge means something with a large amount/volume of space. Hence B is not the answer.\n\nThe option C = big house is misleading, 'big' means huge, it doesn't necessarily mean moving out of or to a huge place, it means to be huge. So C is not the answer. A means big house.\n\nThe words 'Keeping personal objects' doesn't mean'something huge', it suggests that a person is keeping their personal objects, which could mean'small'.\n\nThus D is not the answer because it isn't huge.\nE is not the answer as it doesn't talk about the size of the home, it is more of a description.", "answer": "B: suburban home"}
{"text": "Experts agree that the wording of the following question is imprecise. This type of question is considered by some to be an example of a \"straw man\" argument, which attempts to represent an adversaries position as a weaker version of what they are actually asserting. \n\nInstead of asking \"Why is it likely people will continue talking?\" the better question might be \"Why might people choose to continue talking when they discover something new?\" or even \"How might a person decide to continue talking when they learn new information from a friend?\" \n\nBased on the original question, we can use our knowledge of the English language and human behavior to deduce or infer the potential answer. This is because the answer has to be a'motivation' that drives people to continue a conversation. \n\nThere is no reason given in the instruction for why one might feel 'agreement', 'discomfort' or'misunderstanding' would prompt others to continue talking. This suggests it's not necessary to know the answer. \n\nWe can determine that 'learning about something new' has to be the correct choice because it's the only one that fits the given criteria.\n\nInput: I am so happy I can see more of my friends and family I\u2019m sure some of you will say, \u201cThat\u2019s what you always say.

{"text": "D: change of color \nRationales: \"What?\". This question is testing your understanding of causality, since we usually associate an action with a verb. This question is asking for a result of an action, which isn't a causal question.\nIt's also asking for a physical action or a sensation, not a state of something. \nWe can eliminate some answers with this information.\n\"Sleeping longer\". This is an option for an action because we can sleep longer, but it's not the action that \"Janet knew she was doing\" because she can't cause herself to sleep longer. You don't sleep longer, you sleep.\n\"Getting cold\". This is also an option for an action, but this is just a natural result of being injured.\n\"Death and decay\". This is a description that tells what will happen to Janet after she is injured and, more specifically, what will happen to her body after she has died. \n\"Change of color\". This is the closest answer here and it also has a physical action for the verb \"doing\". \n\n\n### Instructor's notes:\nIn the exercise 1, student has made mistake by writing \"A: box B: apparat\u00fc\u00df C: appliance D.w\u00e4sh dishes E: implement\" because box is capitalized \"Appar\u00e1tus is the correct spelling.

The full sentence is \"In the given question, we see that we are asked for a place where Petrol is obtained.\" Here, 'Where\"is a verb (asking where something is obtained), so we have a causality question and we need an action answer. In the exercise 4, you've made a few mistakes: \"Where might a television used at...\", but we want to ask where a \"television\" is used\". The sentence of question should clearly indicate that \"television\" is being asked. The sentence: \"Where might a televi...\" suggests a place where the \"television\" is, but not a \"television\" itself. You have also made few mistakes in the exercise 5 too.

The idea of crossing road doesn't make any sense as it is related to someone's action. Second, we can infer that cross road is an act, and acts should be followed by a verb which makes option A illogical.\n\nOption B is a feeling that people have related do something that steal your money, we can infer this by noticing that the word feel angry or upset used as it can be related as it indicates the reaction that someone have when they have stolen money. \n\nOption C is a drinking act related to option A as both are two ways of handling when someone steal your money. Option also doesn't make any common sense for someone drink tea when someone stealing his money.\n\nOption D also is a drinking act that people normally do when someone robs your money where the word \"practice\" is also used as it is a common act that most people do when someone steal their stuff. \nOption E is a completing sentence act that people commonly do, we can tell this by noticing that crossing the road is not related to the question and the road is used as an noun, but completing sentence as an act is very general because it can be used in most of the situations such as when we want to make a point that we already explain as the sentence above.

In the given set of options, we will get the answer easily by rule-out method (eliminating options until the correct answer is left) because there are only two prepositions in this question: 'on the way to', and 'to what'.\n2. Out of these two prepositions, we will definitely eliminate one of them. We will check for 'on the way to' which is used when we are on the way to something (for example 'on the way to the airport'). So in our case, it is not used, leaving behind 'to what' as a preposition and now we need to find an answer with 'to what'.\n3. A & B both don't make any sense because the given sentence is not like checking the weather on the way to paradise, so these are to be eliminated.\n4. C does not make any sense too.\n5. D is also out because 'here' is not in context at all. (Also, 'here' is a very broad term and can be anywhere, so don't consider this option too).\n6. Only option left is 1:'surprise us' because 'on the way to paradise' is used here but not like 60 years ago, and today's phrase is more or less like 'on the way to to paradise'.", "answer": "A: look beautiful"}

Ocean means 'the largest of the great bodies of salt water', not appropriate in the context of the sentence.\nD: dull - Dull is not synonymous with sharp. Sharp is a word of a negative connotation that refers to being acute. Dull does not mean sharp, it means \"not interesting\" or \"lacking brightness\". \n\nE: inaccurately - Our only choice in this question is E - inaccuracies with calculations.

{"text": "He was able to pay bills.\n\n### Rationales: \n1. In the question, it was said that sometimes he felt that being able to pay bili was the only reason that he wasn't able to do anything.\n2. He was actively thinking about paying bills and not about doing anything else. \n3. He didn't understand why he had to pay bills all the time. He just wanted to focus on doing something fun. \n4. So, option A: pay debts and D: making money, don't make sense because none of them shows him actively looking for ways to increase his money supply, or be able to focus on doing something that he loves to at most times.\n5. Similarly, Option B: make money and E: keep house, aren't good candidates to answer the question either.\n6. This is because, option B is about gaining money by spending. And Option E is just saying, that he can keep the house afloat.  \n7. All this means that he can keep bills up to a certain extent, but is not capable of focusing on having fun too much at most times. This means that he can at least be able to focus on making money, since that's the only thing he can't do, and he is unable to do that actively. \n8.

Option B, C, and E have birds with unique characteristics that seem to suggest only one bird could possibly fit.\n4.

We need to identify the attribute that distinguishes a \"document\" from an \"obtuse.\" If the document is obtuse then it is a specific type of document which means that for all other documents this attribute wouldn't apply. We also know that \"document\" is a noun so the property must belong to the noun. Now the adjective that describes that property is \"acute\" and we can see in the options that this term is related to \"bright\" or \"clear\".

We need to deconstruct it with the understanding that there are two key words (book and books). These key words are what we must identify.\n\n1. Let's look at the first sentence:  \"You would probably not get a book at a garage sales but you would for books.\" What key words in the sentence?   \"A bookmark\" is certainly something that we might buy at a garage sale and also for \"books.\" If we're to buy a bookmark for books, that's fine since they all relate to books, but then that doesn't actually work as a \"garage sale\" example, because garage sales don't generally involve the selling of \"bookmarks.\" This leaves us with the option that \"garage sale\" here actually relates to \"A book,\" and that a bookmark is something that we might buy for books at some other venue.  It should be easy to remember that buying a bookmark for books is a relevant instance, but buying a bookmark at a \"garage sale,\" as described in the sentence, isn't relevant.  So that eliminates both of the available options, since bookmark \"for books\" in the first sentence requires that we buy them in some venue other than a garage sale, so we will look at option B to see", "answer": "D: clear"}

In that sense, \"indicated\" could be a suggestion of the score itself, which can be indicated, but not the score's notes, which as we have discussed are a different part of the complete musical melody.\n\n### In the given statement, A is incorrect because a \"fridge\" is simply a refrigerator; this is not what we are looking for", "answer": "E: sheet music"}

{"text": "The term'might' in the question could suggest that the answer to the question is based on the assumption that the employee does poor jobs, but we need to consider the full range of potential possibilities. The word 'if' also implies that this scenario involves some contingency or conditions that would be met for a person to receive poor performance feedback from the job, which would then result in some other outcome. \n\nA: Misfortune: The term'misfortune' is too general and does not align well with the specific information provided in the question. It would be unclear why a misfortune would happen as a result of performing poorly on the job. \n\nWe discard the answer 'B: fearful' because a fear associated with poor performance at work would not always be caused by a promotion appraisal. There could be other reasons for that, such as if the employee believes they may be fired for their poor performance in light of their possible future employability. \n\nD: Mistakes: A mistake is indeed a consequence of performing poorly on a task, so, we exclude this option. \n\nC: Criticism: This would be a direct and immediate outcome of poor performance on the job, but, it does not relate to a boss, instead, it's a direct outcome of a poor quality performance. \n\nFinally, the option'make the employee's job more stressful' would be a by-product or consequence of a manager's feedback, but it's not what the question is asking about. \n\nFinishing our analysis and considering all of the options together, we determine the correct choice to be the final option 'E: Promotion appraisal.' \n\nPromotion appraisal: A promotion appraisal is a regular review given to all employees based on a certain performance standard. \n\nPromotion Appraisal: It's a routine and standard occurrence in the workplace that any employee could receive that could lead to feedback given on their performance at their job. \n\nPromotions can be for both better job positions, as well as to maintain the current level of position. \n\nPromoting someone would be for their ability to achieve a benchmark of performance, be it in quality or quantity, or in other aspects related to their responsibilities. \n\nPromote appraisals are given regularly and are dependent on a worker'", "answer": "C: criticism"}
{"text": "Answers: E: Out of order.  The phrase \u201c they were standing in place\u201d signifies that they were in order.

It may grow more in the future.   It is in a stable position, isn't it? Choices: A: not stable B: stable C: unstable D: unlikely\n\n### Response A: Not stable. The options A and D are not related because the phrase in a stable position suggests that an organization or a company is in a stable position.  The options B and C, therefore would not be relevant.\n\n### Response The phrase \u201cgrowing\u201d in the sentence suggests that the organization is a company and has potential to improve more in the future.  Hence, the option C: not stable would have been the optimal choice.\n\n### Rationales: - A company growing or changing it's position in the business market implies a stable position, and not an unstable one. - The option A: Not stable implies that a company cannot grow more, however the organization can have the potential for progress or growth in the following future. So, the phrase \u201cin a stable position\u201d is in contradiction with \u201clooking\u201d to hire other people and departments in the future.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple choice question\n\n### Rationales: The question's key words are: \"bleachers\" and \"first game\". The noun \"game\" is generic and relates to any sporting activity. The words \"first\" and \"mitt\" indicate the age and role of the child. The word \"child\" is not necessarily generic as it relates specifically to the child's age and position. This would require us to differentiate between all the other generic options in order to choose the correct one.\n\n7. Option A: football stadium - This does not make sense as a bleacher is a seating area in most stadiums and not the stadium.\n\n8. Option B: laboratory - This relates to a science experiment. This also makes no sense as a child would not have a bleacher in a laboratory setting.\n\n9. Option C: Baseball stadium - This makes sense as bleachers are common in baseball stadiums.\n\n10. Option D: Pharmacy - Bleachers do not make sense at a pharmacy, unless a drug store had a theater with bleachers.\n\n11. Option E: Soccer game - This is the one and only answer that makes sense as bleach-\n\n###ers are common at soccer game. A baseball field is very rarely made up of bleachers, and a football field also would not have bleachers as bleachers, do not make aesthetic sense, so they're likely be replaced by permanent seats at a stadium.\n\n### Answer: B: baseball stadium\n\n### Instructions: Below is an instruction that directs us to answer a question.

Based on the first three sentences, we can infer that the wet ground refers to a rainstorm.\n3. If it is raining, we can infer from line 4 that we are most liable to experience \"raindrops/hail\".\n4. Therefore, as \"we\" were near us the raindrops/hails landed on us, we are most likely indoors while the rain is happening.\n5. Line 4 mentions that we were \"getting wet\" - so, we can infer that it's raining. \n6. If it is rainy outside, and we were on our way back into a drier environment, then we are likely to experience \"the ground/grounds\" \"getting wet\" too.\n7. We can assume that we would most likely be indoors during rainfall as a protective measure from inclement weather, so \"The wet is occurring near you\" is most likely outside, and not in front of you.\n8.

The choice 'D: Hair loss' is clearly not correct because hair loss is a non-life threatening problem.

It's important to note that, although the negligent person in this situation 'could care less', they clearly don't wish the other person to 'fail'.\n4. We can also know A: unfeeling isn't the correct answer because, technically, unfeeling usually refers to a physical sensation, and it's unclear that person is 'cold' or 'numb' in this situation.\n5. Similarly, D: indifferent isn't the right answer, because we know that this person doesn't have a neutral or indifferent feeling toward the other person.\n6.

So this means, we must pick out which of the two films mentioned in the question would be a good answer.\n3. We cannot pick either of these movies as an answer. That's because there's always at least one better movie than a given one. \n4.

Choices:  A. was B. took C. took away D. took back E. took up\nRationales: Let's examine what we can see from our options.\n1. \"Took it took away\" is not what we are looking for; the meaning is not the same.\n2. \"Took it up took back\" is not the same answer either; the meaning is not clear.\n3. So, this can be eliminated.\n4. \"Took long took away\" is not accurate either; the destination is different.\n5. \"Took long\" is not the answer; it's how long our journey took. \n6. \"Was amused long\" is not the same. \n7. \"Took long time\" is not accurate either. \n8. Only we were amazed at how took took is the correct sentence structure. \n9. So, the sentence you were looking for is: \"We were amazed at how did take took\". \n10.

{"text": "D\n\n### Rationales:1. It has been given that the lady was doing a one-man show which tells us that we need to think what the word one-man show means2. One man show means that the lady is a single person doing the play and also she will be the only one on the stage3. The lady does what? Now the question is asking about the lady's actions in the play. We know at the start of the  show, the lady will act alone so she will do the play herself.4. The lady's action will be a complete and independent actions on the stage5. Now we know that the lady has taken the centre stage, the next thing that we will find relevant will be whether the lady started to speak before the show started. I think because the show is not yet shown,then the lady wouldn't be speaking, the lady will be speaking only when she is on the stage which makes answer  A: persuade and answer B: sleep invalid because these 2 will not be relevant only if the lady is on the stage.6. Now we can eliminate the answer choices C: take center stage and E: speak clearly because both of them will be valid only if the lady is performing the show on stage and it clearly states at start of the show the lady was doing the one-man show, there for only D can be the answer.7. Now that the question has been reduced to answer choice D, we can find a meaning of D by looking in the word bank. We find that the word D challenge means the same as A : persuade.

None of these options can be taken as the correct answer, because all the seats in the vehicle are full.\n3. The bag would usually be kept in the car trunk but the vehicle having no trunk as it is full there is no other option left except storing the bag in an empty seat.\n\n### Input:\"I can't understand why there are such a great deal of empty seats,\" said the lady. \"It's a busy restaurant! I know a better restaurant, it's much nicer, and there aren't ever any empty seats there!\" I hope I don't lose my job if I say this, I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings!\" the lady added.\n\n### Response:\"I won't tell anyone as you are not even here to hurt anyone's feeling,\" said Sajid.\n\n### Explanation:There are many people in the restaurant, and very few empty seats, \"I can't understand\" says the lady.\n1. In this sentence, \"I know a better restaurant,...and there aren't ever\" says something special about the restaurant they were already at. As per the sentence \"I know a better\" restaurant is better in comparison to the restaurant they were at. If it is not a better restaurant rather it is just an ordinary restaurant.\n2.

The people who are not at the restaurant right now are not going to be bothered with whom their seats are given to. They probably just gave their seats to the people they like most.\n4.

{"text": "The answer is \"make speeches / give speeches\"\nExplanation:\n\n1. The people in the question are speech therapists, which is a profession that generally involves working with people who have speech impairments by teaching them how to form words and sentences properly.\n2. Therefore, we need to consider what speech therapists typically do. \n3. One important thing that we learn by exploring the options is that speech therapists do not make music. \n4. If they build houses, they must be carpenters, not speech therapists. \n5. As far as their belief in a higher power, speech therapists would be equally inclined to believe in a God as anyone else, and it would be difficult to state which option is true or false. \n6. We can conclude that speech therapists are not defined according to their belief or their lack thereof in a certain religion.\n7. It is also important to note that option D: complete sentences and E: build houses aren't defined by the action itself, but rather by the context of a sentence.\n8. Speech therapists don't usually complete sentences for others, and building a house isn't very significant. \n9. Finally we come to option A: Make music and option B: Give speeches.\n10.

A: \"illness\" is the correct answer because it is the best option that matches the context provided in the question and the usage of the word \"it\" in the sentence.\n\n### Task:\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n### Input 1:\nWhat could you get if you don't buy anything in the shop? Choices: 1) nothing 2) 0 products 3) 0 cents 4) 0 dollars\nRationales:1. The word \"buy\" is used in the question. From the context, it indicates the acquisition of any item such as products, groceries or any item for sale. When you buy something, you normally don't get any return value. A return value is anything that the buyer gets from the seller. Hence, the correct answer choice is \"nothing\".\n\n### Input2:\nWhich of the following does not give you any additional memory? Choices: 0) a laptop 1) a smartphone 2) a tablet computer 3) a mobile phone 4) a desktop computer 5) an mp3 player\nRationales:\n1. Lets first analyze the non-options.\n2. Option 0) a laptop doesn't give anyone any additional memory because laptops are the opposite, they have little memory.\n3. Option 1) a smart phone, 2) a table computer does'n give additional memory, rather these are a great source of storage and retrieval of information.\n4. Option 3) a mobile is a communication device, it isn't a device that gives extra memory. It is not the correct answer option.\n5.

{"text": "The sun was out and temperature was rapidly changing due to which A: temperature cooling down rapidly.\n\n### Rationale:\nThis is because of the words like \"rapidly\", \"dropping quickly\" and other similar phrases, temperature is not rising but cooling down. The other options are correct but, not in the condition of rapidly changing temperature. As the temperature starts to drop in winter it stays for months; so this won't be the case for the question.\n\n## TF-IDF Analysis\n\n### Text:The sun was out, the temperature rapidly changing what with the sun being down and all, that's crazy!\n\n### Top Terms: temperature, what, sun, being, rapidly, all, changing, out, with\n\n### Frequencies:\ntemperature\n.6667\nwhat\n.6513\nsun\n.573\nbeing\n.5785\nrapidly\n.5538\nall\n.5565\nchanging\n.5566\nout\n.5404\nwith\n.512\n\n### TF-IDF Matrix:\n\n![Output](https://github.com/anuruddhkumar/TFIDF-Exercise/blob/main/img/Matrix.PNG)\n\n### Result:\nAll the terms occur together at least once. So, temperature appears twice and it is also more prevalent, meaning more frequent, as compared to other terms. So, the most relevant answer is temperature, in this context, it is dropping or going down quickly i.e. rapid. This is backed by TF-IDF values assigned to the term as well.", "answer": "E: heat up"}

{"text": "### Answer:\n\n### Rationales:\n1. We are asked to identify the opposite of the word \"hosting\". \n2. We have to consider both the words used in the question as well as their meanings. \n3. Let' view these two options.\n4. Option A: \"few people\" doesn't really appear to be opposite to \"hosting\". Indeed, \"few people\" is quite the opposite of \"hosting\".\n5. Option B: \"pay debt\" doesn't appear to be opposite to hosting. \n6. Option C: \"individual\" is indeed opposite to host although it's an ambiguous choice. If we consider the meaning of the word from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, an \"individual\" can be a person, but it can also be the opposite from host.\n7. Option D: \"single person\" is opposed to hosting in the sense that when you have a single person, you don't actually host them. \n8. Option E: \"small group\", this also aligns with hosting as it usually requires having a \"group\", as opposed to the single person of option D.\n9. Now, based on the information above, we can answer that the opposite of \"host\" is \"small group\". \n10. However, a small group would imply that other terms, especially, individual terms or personal belongings, aren't mentioned. And, at the same time, these belongings still need to be in the same room as all the guests are, hence, you might want \"few\" people.\n11. But, in the opposite to hosting, people aren't really implied, it's a matter of \"person\" and \"group\". Now we can see that the only proper choice is a \"small group\" not because it's opposed to \"hosting\", but because that's the literal definition from the Merriam Webster Dictionary and that's also what the question wanted. There's a chance of you missing this, so don't forget to go to the definition and check it up.\n\n### Reference:\n* Merriam Webster's dictionary- https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary\n* Thesaurus.com- https://www.thesaurus.com\n\n### Input:\"", "answer": "A: few people"}

The key words to identify are \"superman fly overhead\" and this indicates that superman flew over children.\n2. \"Superman fly overhead\" is a verb phrase and since it has a verb in it, a reaction of the subject to the verb should be used to determine the correct one.\n3. This would mean that we would need to extract the verb and its subject from the question.\n4. The verb here would be \"exclaim\". \n5. We then extract the subject. That is the word \"children\". \n6.

Choices: A: go for a walk B: vent out our feelings C: burn off our energy D: tell our stories E: burn things F: meditate\n\nAnswer: C: burn off our anger\nRationale:\n1. In the sentence, we see the use of the words \"we\" and \"we're\". So we're looking for an answer that is relevant for a general audience.\n2. We're told that our anger is what we mean to \"burn off\" - this is an actual action that might happen to us while we're \"angry\", so we also want a noun that we could actually say \"burn\".\n3. The given options have a variety of meanings. Option B: go for a walk would be an action that one could do as a way of reducing or avoiding anger. However, from the fact that the sentence uses the phrase \"we're angry\", we know that we're talking about people who are already angry, and the thing that we've been talking about being \"angry\" is what we've been using the word \"anger\" to refer to previously. So the answer that is being sought has to somehow relate to this \"anger\". Option C: burn off our feelings is the only option that includes the word \"burn\" (and not \"burn off\") and involves us doing an action to express our feelings.\n4. Option D: tell our stories also includes the word \"burn\", but in this case it means to say our story verbally with words that other people can hear rather than taking actions that could perhaps burn things. Option E: burn things is a choice that is not actually burned, which we can infer from the use of the phrase \"burn off our anger\", rather than \"burn our anger\".\n5. Option F: meditate doesn't really fit since meditation is an action that is usually undertaken to reduce stress rather than anger. We would probably do something else with \"anger\" in mind.\n6.

So this leaves us with A: Wooded area.\n\n### Why:\n1. We use a question mark to find relationship to a full stop.\n2. A: Wooded area would refer to a beaver in the woods area. This is a beaver related to leaves in the word 'wooded'. The beaver would have to find somewhere to leave in the woods.

However, *redemption is not the only possible result of a forgiving attitude*.\n\n*Relief* is frequently a result of forgiveness. While redemption specifically refers to the act of redeeming something or paying someone back, relief is broader in that it includes a general sense of well-being or feeling better.\n\nWhen we forgive someone, we might feel a sense of relief in knowing that they no longer pose a danger to us. We might also feel a sense of redemption in the sense that we can move on from the past and be able to look forward into the future with a clean slate.\n*Therefore, the correct answer will be E: *get feel relief*.

Options B and C are both animals, and therefore cannot serve as the beaver\u2019s structure feature. Option D is not a feature of a structure in general; it is a feature of wood. Options A and E can be eliminated simply because they do not contain the right key feature of \u201cblocking\u201d any kind of feature, and option E, though it would be difficult to block since it is animals inside.

Choice (A) is \"early night,\" so it's likely not the correct answer to a question about the sunrise.\n\n5. Choice (B) is \"late morning,\" so it's possible that it might refer to the time that the sun is just starting to rise. And it's definitely possible that the sun is rising late in comparison to the time in the question, but it still doesn't seem likely that the question is being asked \"what time would it be too watch the sun rise?\n\n6.

The choice C cannot be true either, as it's impossible for a robot to buy a book. This leaves us with choices D and E, but they're impossible as it's impossible to open a book or learn to read at the same time.

Choices A: pay bills B: group together C: enjoy themselves D: face each other E: believe in god\nDemonstration Write a reply that completes the request. What is a common way for people in the globe to chat with each other?  \n\n### Demo: Answer:  \nD: face each Other  \nRationale: 1. The first question and the second question is similar, they both want to know how people can meet with each other. They ask \"What is an/a common way, \"while in this one the asker simply asks \"What is a common way\", which means that \"What\" is changed. This is because the asker wants to ask about a specific thing. \n2. From this question, it is easier to choose the correct answer from the remaining because it's easier to choose from four options instead of five. \n3. Looking at the choices, the choices C: group together and D: face each Other are the same. So we know that A: pay bills and E: believe in god could be eliminated. \n4. From the remaining two choices, it is clearer what the asker wants to hear since it is the word \"chat\" and not what is an other way. \n5. When looking at question 2, the answer from the choices C: group and D: face each other, there could be various ways of interpretation. In my opinion, group together means a gathering while face each other means to be next to each other. Also, the word \"group\" is used twice in question 1 while in question 2 \"group\" does not appear. \n6. So that's the reason I chose D: face each other which mean to be next to each and chat.\n\n### Demo Response:  \n  Input: What is an/a common/way for people in the world/to/chat with each other?

The idea is that the movie theater is someplace indoor and contains a wide variety of businesses, while the theater containing unpaid actors is described as indoor itself and operates as part of the indoor space.\n\nBut what is a good explanation for picking up on why the theater in the answer is an indoor theater and unpaid actors?\n\nIn the real world, most movie theaters require an entrance fee, and there are some movie theaters where tickets are also required to enter and watch.

{"text": "D: coffin\n\nThe given question suggests that the dog is probably located within a casket or coffin. The choices A, B, and C do not seem to have relevancy to the given context although one could argue that a dog is more likely to be found at its \"home\" in option A. However, this assumption is too broad given the question's context that suggests that the dog is lost or missing.  Similarly, the option E is likely to be incorrect since dogs are generally not buried in Denmark, although this too is debatable - perhaps the dog is lost in Denmark! However, the context of the question suggests otherwise since the location is described as the New England, which means one of the options B, C, and D are most likely the acceptable answers.\n\n### Rational:\nAlthough this is a very subtle question, in which all of the choices are relatively plausible, the given context and clues are what determine which option is most likely the correct answer.  In this case, the dog could be lost in an old mahogany coffin, a coffin containing a corpse, a casket containing a corpse, or in a new casket being prepared for a corpse.  These contexts lend themselves to only one of the options appearing the most likely, which is option C: coffin.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe text suggests that the dog is most likely lost in a coffin or casket; the given options do not suggest or have a strong connection to that context.  The clue that the dog is probably in a coffin is given by the descriptive context of \"lived in New England\" since this is a place where the practice of interring animals in coffins/caskets is common practice.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe question is a bit of a \"red herring\" when you look at the choices; they all sound plausible initially however each choice has some kind of inherent problems.  It's only after you take the \"context\" into consideration that you can determine the answer.", "answer": "C: new hampshire"}
{"text": "The correct response is [Option E - Celebrate].\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Option A indicates 'Crowd go mad'. It is a verb. As it happens at the end of the concert, it is not the correct answer to the asked question.\n\n2. Option B indicates 'Working hard'. It is also a verb. Since it is not used by the band, we infer the band enjoyed their success and that they might have celebrated at the start of their concert.\n\n3. Option C indicates 'Clap' - a verb. Since it sounds very ordinary, the band might not have enjoyed clapping.\n\n4. Therefore all the options with verbs in them are not suitable for the given question.\n\n5. Option D indicates 'Reproduce'. As we know that it is the process of playing recorded music. It is not the correct answer for it indicates how the band might have enjoyed themselves at the start of their first concert.\n\n6. Finally Option E indicates 'Clap', which is similar to Option C.

Choices:  A. played B. performed C. clapped D. reproduced E. heard\n\n### Response:'The correct (most likely) answer is Option E - Heard.'.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. We can eliminate the options which are not verbs. A, B, and C are not verbs, C indicates it's a noun. Options D and E are verb, hence they are correct options.\n\n2. Out of the options we already have, D indicates a process of making music. Hence if they clap, it is to indicate the process how they made the music. To listen to (hear) indicates the end process of creating music, which the band enjoyed during the start of their first ever concert.\n\n3.'Option E - Heard' is the correct response.", "answer": "A: hear crowd go mad"}

In fact, almost everything from the newspaper to a blog is an inference of something that really happened.\n- You start with what you know or observe. As you learn more information, you create your inference. You might think that inferring is merely making a guess, but it's really a form of deductive reasoning.\n    - A deductive argument is a logical argument that includes the logical steps of:\n        - premises\n        - a conclusion that follows from the premises\n- Most articles and stories rely on inferences to explain what we don't fully understand about a situation or to support a point of view.\n\n### Where is inference needed to get good at English?\n- To get good at English, you need to be able to use inferences to help you understand the ideas under the text or story.\n- You might also need to practice inferential questions:\n    - What question can follow this sentence?\n        - \"In the end, they were all very happy.\"\n        - What?\n    - Who was very happy in the end?\n        - They were all.\n    - What did they do?\n        - They had a party.\n    - \"Whatever you are going to do, do now.\"\n        - What should I do?\n        - Do it.\n- What kind of questions are these?

{"text": "This time, a question is being asked about a place one \"wanted to go\" and not necessarily about a place they were or where they found themselves but here we can still apply the basic premises of reasoning with options and eliminate the invalid ones using logic.\n\n### Answer: The options here are all describing places.  A 'roadblock' is unlikely to be a place where people live or frequent.  A 'desert' would be unlikely to be a populated area where people live, as many live in areas that don't naturally include deserts, and there's little reason for them to frequent a desert.  The 'driving to and from a particular location everyday' is likely one's place of work or somewhere they live, but it doesn't really describe the people that live on the street as such. Finally, a 'populated area' is a place where people live. We can see that these options are all describing places that people don't necessarily live in.  Let's find out about the final answer, C: populated areas. \n\n### The populated area is likely a neighborhood or residential area.\nThe key words in the sentence \"race track\" that relate to \"going to where the people are\" are \"people\" and \"track\". The word \"track\" is not the key word in the sentence but it's an important clue. The option A: race track is the correct answer.", "answer": "B: populated areas"}

Choices: A: a person B: peace and quiet C: a friend D: nothing E: an argument\nRationales:1. During a period of peace is referred to as, there is no noise, no disturbance. Hence, one should find a place where there is nothing. One cannot be at a place where the noise would not bother or disturb one, but where there is no noise.\n2.The word 'nothing' in the last option means that one will not find something, there will be nothing there.There may be no friend, no person, but nothing will be there. It is clear, therefore, that it must be nothing.\nAnswer: E-an argument\n\nInput: In which place could you find quiet and peace? Choices: A. a mall B. noisy place C. a public place D. a cafeteria E. a library\nRationales: To find quiet and peace, one should go to a place which is free from noise. A mall, cafeteria, library will not be a right place if it is noisy. One would not be able to find quiet and peace there since a mall and a cafeteria are not ideal places for being quiet and peaceful.\nA library is considered to be quiet and peaceful since the main purpose of the library is to be quiet and peace. Hence, the correct answer to this question should be a library. Answer: A library\n\nInput: What was he doing, a friend found him? Choices: A-reading B-working C-sleeping D-eating E-studying\nRationales: If we look at the given context, we can say that the person who is studying has his earphones on. This suggests that studying might or might not be in a noisy environment. However, it is obvious that he is studying as his friend found him. So the context of the question is to identify in which place he was studying", "answer": "A: television"}
{"text": "<b>We just need to break this question into smaller parts. We're given that someone is going to be cooking food (for example, breakfast is not cooking food), and we're then told that someone is going to cook something before they start cooking (before the breakfast). So that means that someone is going to have their breakfast before they start cooking. \n\nSince their breakfast is before they'll cook something, they need to have a breakfast; they don't need to pack something or bag food, they can literally just eat. We don't need to light a fire to have a breakfast either. So that means if they can grab a match to have their breakfast, they can just grab a breakfast. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that A:'make breakfast' is not the correct answer.</b> \n\n<b>Now we have to decide if they will pack something, bag something, or light something. Since they don't need a match to eat their breakfast, they might need a bag or a pack instead to hold their bag of breakfast food. So option C says: 'pack a bag or a pack' to be more general about what they are packing. They could be packing their belongings, in general, not just food.</b> <b>\n\nSo the other options would be A: 'grab a match' and B: 'go hiking.'</b> \n\nHowever, there is this one thing with B: 'go hikhing,' which means we need some further reasoning. In order for their breakfast to taste better, they might need a nice trail, and that can only be obtained by going hiking to get it. But the point is that a meal with a view can never do you wrong, especially when it comes to a breakfast like this. They would want to add some extra color to their breakfast by going hiking, but they would not need to light a fire. In the case that it is too dangerous to light a fire, they could use a microwave or an electric range. However, they might not be able to find an electric range in the wilderness, so we can conclude that they would likely have electricity.\n\nWe also understand that people living on their own can't have matches by themselves. If they did have matches, they wouldn't need to cook outside, because they could just toast", "answer": "D: light fire"}

Boil noodles until just soft might mean the lasagne mixture needs to be softened in a water bath, rather than boiled.  So not A.\n3. Step 2, spread the sauce on a light oil baking tray might mean spreading sauce between the layers, but this would be part of Step 7, B: Arrange layers with bechemel, Bolognaise mix and cheese, not step 2.  So not B.\n4. Step 3, Arrange layers with becehmel, Bologenaise mix and cheese means the noodles and the Bolognese mixture need to be combined.

This means we have to pick a verb and we need to pair a proper verb with the part of speech \"is\", so \"actually\" is the prepositional phrase and \"is\" is the verb of the whole sentence.  In the options, I don't see any verbs that are very similar to \"behave\", so I think the answer MUST be D: guard house.\n\n\n### Input\nWhat did they eat a lot of? Choices:  B: rice  C: wheat D: fish E: peas\n### Response: The correct answer on choice C \"Wheat\" since rice and fish are not items that the children ate in excess of.\n### Rationale\nThe key here is that we could not think of any item from choices A through D would mean to eat in excess.  Thus, the answer must be C \"wheat\" which is an item that the author mentions in the previous context of the story.\n\n### Input What did the children eat a lot of?\n### Response: They ate a lot of rice, wheat and fish\nAnswer: The correct answer is the whole sentence\n\n### Input The best way to clean a screen is with a clean cloth.\n### Response:  The clean cloth can replace the word best, and therefore \"the clean cloth \" is the best way to clean a monitor.\n\n### Note:\nThe answer is in bold\n\n### Input \nTreat the problem seriously and it'll go away, don't panic.\n### Response\nWhat is a logical consequence of this? Choices:  D: Don't panic\n\nWe can't think of a consequence that wouldn'", "answer": "C: fly"}
{"text": "### Rationale for the Response Selection:\n\n### Difficulty Point:\n- The word \"unfortunately\" indicates that the sentence doesn't actually mean the woman was \"fortunate'' to be sick.\n- So there is no option that is 'fortunate' to have the woman sick and staying inbed, \n- which takes us away from the answer A: resting, \n- B: sleep more, C: bed sores, D: missing out, E: comfort\n- Since the sentence says \"was sick\" instead of being sick, we deduce that the sickness was temporary not long lasting.\n- The word \"miss out\" is a transitive verb that indicates that an action is required to miss out on an opportunity.\n- \"Comfort\" isn't in the correct part of speech, and has nothing to do with staying in bed.\n- None of these options are related to a sickness where a person is forced to stay in bed.\n- So the answer that comes to mind is the best choice, which is \"unfortunately D: missing out on the event, since the event has nothing to do with comfort, resting, sleeping, or staying in bed.", "answer": "D: missing out"}

Option A seems like it may be a bit involved with describing the color of the fruit, and would therefore not be a realistic guess that fits the question.\n4. Option B is too general, and could not be applied to anything with a set number of elements, such as the given question's apple tree.\n5. A garden center may also have a collection of fruit trees and would be the ideal place to observe the growth of apples and other kinds of trees. But it is not an equation.\n6. Option D is a math related concept, but doesn't match what the given question wants.\n7. Option E is gravity related and probably makes the most sense, however gravity alone could apply to apples falling off a tree, on their own, without any other intervention.\n8. Therefore in answering the question, we would like to conclude that something has taken place that led to a loss of apples on the apple tree. Gravity doesn't seem to be a primary reason for the loss of fruit.\n9. We are led to conclusion that what we have here is a math problem.\n10. Let's consider math equations as a whole.

Options B and D are gramatically correct, but the word \"suicide\" is grammatically incorrect (suicide is a noun).

Choices:  ABCD Choices:  A. a newspaper B. a novel C. the daily news D. a news app\nRationales: The given question is asking which of the given options we would be most likely to read information from. It is not asking for the answer to the information in the newspaper and is not asking for all information from the given options. Let's consider each option carefully.\n1. For option A: a newspaper, the given context is that there is information that we need to read. The words newspaper and information are both nouns, so we need a noun describing a piece of information that we know and have read. Information cannot describe a newspaper, therefore A is not the correct answer\n2. For option B: a novel, the given words are newspaper and information. Therefore, we can only choose answers given that don't contradict the content and meaning of the words in the statement. When we look at the context we see that the question is not asking us to read a novel, but to read something. Therefore B is not the correct answer to the question.\n3. The same observation applies to option C: daily news. The given context is not to read a newspaper or the daily news (or the information in them). It is not asking about the daily news in itself, so C is not the correct answer either\n4. The only answer left as a possible option to the question is option D, a news app. The question is not specifically asking which form of news we will read. The context of the question is to read information (not necessarily the daily news) and not necessarily in a newspaper or in a novel.

The only thing I can think of is \"mortal\". So, if you want to choose an option that doesn't contradict logic, you must choose either \"A: will die\" or \"D: can die\"...I guess either one is acceptable.\n\nAnswer:\nD: will die\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n### Input 1: The house was large, which of the following describes it the best?

A: dead and B: mortal C. can D be killed E: dying and dying E: dead and dying\n\n### Final Instructions:\nIn either case, choose the \"D: can die\". \"B: mortal\" contradicts with the very first instruction. And neither the \"A: will die\", nor the \"C: can die\" is the choice that matches the first instruction, which is \"the key word is \"dead\" and not \"die\". A mortal life doesn't mean that you'll die, because \"I am mortal\" would mean that you'll eventually die, not \"I will die\". So basically, \"A: will die and B: mortal\" are both choices that contradict logic and have been ruled out by the first instruction. You only have \"C: can\", \"D: can\" and \"E: can\" as your options. \"C: can\" simply doesn't work because of the word \"mortal\", and you can't pick \"E: can\" because you can't kill someone twice.

The sentence could go something like 'Most people are able to transport themselves using ____'.\n\n#### Input:\n#### Instruction:\nIncorporate the key words from the sentence into the answer.\n\n#### Solutions:\n\n#### Demonstration: \nInput: Most people will not know what a \"_____ is. Choices:  A. car B. taxi C. bicycle D. helicopter E. tractor\n\nRationales:\n1. We can get an idea of what an item is and infer the answer.\n2. Let' say an answer option is A \"car\".\n3. A \"car\" is an item that can be driven, either humanly or autonomously (driven without a designated driver); a \"car\" is usually used by an individual to transport themselves from one place to another.\n4. Hence, we know that answers like B and C are incorrect; this is because a \"bicycle\" will be ridden by a single person rather than used for the transportation of other human beings, where multiple people can sit at the same time.  \nThe \"traffic\" involved on a bike does not require a set of wheels for many occupants; rather, the bicycle is meant for the transportation of a single person.\n5. Similarly, a \"helicopter\" has multiple wheels, and can carry multiple occupants, making the answer D the correct option.\n6. Lastly, there is a difference between a \"tractor\" and a simple car, in that a \"tractor\" can not be driven by a single person. Rather, it is used to tow something or transport a group of people or items, such as a tractor pulling in a field with a wagon.\n7. These differences are in reference to the meaning of \"most people\".  \nMost people ride and drive cars (including autonomous cars).  \nMost people rarely ride a helicopter while they probably ride a bicycle.  \nMost people do not know what a tractor is.  \nMost do not tow things with a tractor.\n8. Thus, the correct option is D: helicop", "answer": "B: own cars"}
{"text": "> A white shoe must be worn to a wedding to which the white shoe is specifically intended. The other options do not apply.\n\n### Rationales\n\n1. The key words \"white shoe\" and \"wedding\" indicate a \"where\". \n2. The other options are not what they're describing, which indicates that the answer could be A.  \n3. If a person were going to wear a white shoe to a wedding, they'd typically wear it on their foot. The answer therefore is B: left foot.\n4. But this doesn't answer the actual question, which specifies that a white shoe must be \"worn\" at a wedding, not carried. \n5. The question does not specify a particular wedding, as it could be any type of wedding. \n6. The answer is C: closet. We're not told to wear a white shy to a specific wedding or a particular person, so we can infer that the white shoe is intended for any wedding. If you're carrying a white shoe to any wedding, you probably won't wear it.\n\n### Input - Question\n\n**Input:**What might a woman have in her bangles? Choices: 1. A: pink, green and dark yellow 2. B: blue and red  3. C: orange, red and dark yellow  4. D: blue and yellow 5. E: yellow\n\n### Response\n\n> An explanation as to why a woman has or might have the color yellow, green and pink bangles.\n\n### Response - Rationales\n1. The key word 'bangles' indicates that whatever is implied by this word is what we are looking for.\n2. The other hints in the sentence give us an indication as to the possible answers in part \"where\" and \"what\" (the choice of 'and').\n3. It is clear that one could not have an \"orange, red and dark yellow\" bracelet as the choice, rather they have to be \"yellow\". Hence the answer is A: bangles\n4. Similarly, one could not have the choice 'blue and red', but only 'blue and yellow'. Hence, the answer is D: bangles\n5. Finally, since we don't know if", "answer": "A: wedding"}
{"text": "Let's consider each of the available choices, in order of how likely they are to contain a hairpin. Let's begin with the first choice which is the hair salon (A). We can see that a hair salon is likely to contain a hairpin, and is consistent with the direction in the question. If we look next at the hair of a woman (C), we see that the clue that indicates a person (e.g., a woman) is also relevant in the question. Therefore it is also a reasonable choice. Let's consider the other choices in terms of specificity. The barber shop (B) and the pincushion (D) do not contain the word \"hairpin\" directly, and since we can't read minds, we won't know if a hairpin is present (or not) in these locations. So that leaves the woman's hair (E). We see that this is a very broad location and not very specific. It could mean that the hairpin is anywhere throughout the woman's hair but it also could mean that a hairpin is specifically located in just one strand. It is also possible that a woman's hair doesn't contain a hairpin because women usually have a hairpin in their mouth not in their hair.\n### Conclusion:Since all of the other locations except the woman's hair contain the word \"woman\", our conclusion is that the woman's hair contains the hairpin. Therefore the answer is E: woman's.\n\n### Input \u2753: Which of the following items is rarely found under the sink? Choices: 1. A: light bulb 2. B: a candle 3. C: electricity 4. D: gas 5.

However this does not answer the question.\n\n## Answer:\nIf we are to answer the question we need to look again at the sentence in it's entirety.\n\"The great, but non- specific, overall benefit of exercise is... \" - the key phrase is \"great, but non-specific\" - we are to look for a great benefit with non-specific application.\n\"This exercise is great but non- specific, the overall benefit of our practice is fatigue\" - there it is, we have found a great, but non specific general benefit.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe following is the complete answer:\n\nIt may be that the sentence is ambiguous,  the question asks us to identify the 'great' benefit of exercise, but the first sentence uses the term 'general'.  However, the benefit of exercise is to be 'great', not general'.\nThat is the benefit of exercise is not non- specific, specifically, the benefit of exercise includes good health.\n\nAnother consideration would be that if our benefit is to be general, which would indicate a non 'great', then we are to select option B: heart attacks.\n\nFinally the sentence may have a word missing as well.

A state that will never end or cease to exist.\n\nCombining these two words, we have a fact that is always being believed or adhered to without a single question or complaint. In essence, it is a widely accepted truth.\n\n### Considering:\n\nAfter breaking down the keywords, the answer will be obvious to you. However, should you be confused in any way, consider the options again, but this time, answer based on location.\n\nEver heard of the \"North Pole region\"? If you're not so sure where's the \"North Pore\", simply put, it is known to always have the coldest temperature, always present snow and is always covered with a thick sheet of ice. \n\nThis region as you know is located at the Earth's North Pole and is thus the answer to our question.

Option C talks about buying athletic equipment that is true in certain cities, but not cities in general. D, however is describing a stadium but not a city. They are both close enough where we can assume that they can accommodate the question.\nOption D is the more correct answer because it describes a place where there are hundreds of sporting goods shops.\n\nNote: Always be sure to analyze any word and their connotation to the sentence.\n\n### Note: \n\nA place where you can buy hundreds of sporting goods is most likely to be in or around a city. A city will have an easier time accommodating more sporting goods stores.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe place where people buy sporting goods at hundreds of stores are generally in and around cities. It's easy and convenient to find an area or a place where there are multiple stores in a city compared to other options.\n\nMoreover, a city will not only be a location where many sporting goods stores are but also where there could be hundreds.\n\nHence the answer would be Option D - a city\n\n--- \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "answer": "B: city"}

This doesn\u2019t describe what Bill did to the \u201cenemy\u201d according to the given input.\n\n'Engagement' means that Bill has started to deal with or take part in a battle/fight/warfare. This is the appropriate response given the context of the input.", "answer": "E: engage"}

{"text": "Answer the following question.\nRationales:1. According to my interpretation of the question, the fox hunting occurs when not in a forest because it finds a habitat outside a forest where it resides at the forest's peripheries. 2. The key questions here are: where is a forest located and where is a fox hunting (the location) found at? 3. We can eliminate all but one option. 4. Let's analyze their possible meanings. For example, a fox, an animal, stays in a forest. But if it \"hunts\" (performs a fox hunting task) somewhere outside the forest, does it reside next to a forest? 5. A: open meadow is not the answer because it doesn't suggest where it (a fox) would hunt since it could be located on any terrain and the hunting is located anywhere within the fox's habitat. 6. So A: open meadow isn't an option. 7. B: arctic tunde is interesting because the habitat of a taiga is a polar region called tundra, so taiga foxes hunt mostly nearby tundra; but the hunting in the question isn't located in the tundra it hunt and resides within a terrain which is outside a forest but not in the tundra. 8. Similarly C: beach is not the answer because a fox isn't a shorebird; it doesn't locate its hunting on the beach. 9. The choice D: great outdooses includes all potential locations that occur within the habitat of the arctic fox. 10. Thus by eliminating all the prior options, we are left with the final answer, which is E: England. \n \nAnswer: E: England", "answer": "A: open meadow"}

{"text": "Choice: D: house\n\n### Response Rationale:\nWhen deciding on the correct answer, it's important to determine if any of the given options can adequately replace the entire sentence. Let's examine this carefully. We can see that a good portion of the sentence refers to the action of obtaining \"light\", as opposed to a single form of light which is being referred to. We also note that the sentence uses \"vintage, decorative\" as a means of describing the light source. Considering that the phrase \"in my possession\" is not specifically referring to a light source (which is being referred to as \"vintage,\", it would be safe to assume that the sentence refers to more than just the light source itself, but the \"vintage,.\" \"Decorative\" does indeed describe light sources; so we can cross out option A: \"sun\" as well as option B: \"sky\" as these descriptions do not pertain to \"vintage,\".  We can also rule out option C: \"candle\" due to use of the term \"light source\".  We can also eliminate option D: \"lamp,\" as this word describes a form of light, rather than the vintage object, or \"vintage, itself, as it is a part of the sentence. Finally, option E: 'house' is indeed a form of a light source, and we can infer that it is what the sentence refers to as being vintage.  Thus, the correct answer is E: 'house'\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Input:If I have been offered a chance to study at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, then I might want to choose the University of Southampton.

We must consider where things are visible, or what we can see in our physical reality, and the places where things can be viewed virtually, where our reality is shaped by our perceptions and/or imagination.\n4.

Option A includes \"same things,\" which is ambiguous, since many locations may display differing objects or events. Hence this is not a suitable answer.\n8.

In the options, both A and B have to do with time and place for travel, but the word sophisticate does not have anything to do with one\u2019s routine and does not match our question, so we exclude it.\n\nD has heavenly as it is very interesting. And E is novel, which we can get rid of because in the options of A which is sophisticated, E has a similar meaning to it and E doesn\u2019t include our keyword, so it is easy to exclude it. In option C we have arcane which means the word is too hard to understand, that means when you are studying and it really easy to be confused, so it is easy for us to eliminate it. If we have a close look at the remaining two options B and D, B is imprevist which means a difficult thing will happen and it will be an obstacle, when we are trying to get rid of a routine we need the thing to be easy and we are to choose \u2018sophisticate because it is not an obstacle, but an opposite.

Choices: 1. A: Be confident 2. B: Have many friends 3. C: Be a good student 4. D: Pay extra attention in class\nRationales : Let\u2019s analyze each of these choices and their relationship to the question: \n1. Confidence : Confidence is very essential. But it is not only a child needs it to do well in school. It is essential for everybody including adults. \n2. Friends : Having many friends is a positive thing, but it depends on the child. It would not affect if the child doesn\u2019t have any. It also doesn\u2019t mean that friends would make a student smart. One might study only by himself/herself and still do well. \n3. Being a good student : Being a good student is absolutely essential to get good grades in school. \n4. Paying attention in class : This is also a good thing to do. But it is not essential to do well in school nor alone of these options. \nNow let\u2019s see what the options imply. \n1. Option A : A child can be confident if the parents encourage him/her to work for their goals. It means the parent\u2019s support is essential for the child to do well in school as well as life in general. \n2. Option B: The child\u2019s classmates are often friends as well. But what the speaker is implying is that more friends is better for a student to do well in school, not more intelligent.\n3. Option C : This is the essential one in order for a child to do well in a school life. \n4.

The question is a tricky one where students are asked to identify an odd choice of phrase with the given options.\n2. By the first part of the question, it is clear that \"all students\" means the entire class.\n3. The teacher wants everyone to help clean up the room, including the students who made it a mess in the first place.\n4.

{"text": "(answer) B: passenger\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The context of the sentence suggests that the answers will describe how people spend their time before they are allowed to use electronics on the plane.\n2. Considering this information and analyzing each of the given answers, we can see that only option D: fly the plane directly involves action or activity. But the other answers (A, B, C, and E) aren't activities.\n3. For example, if a person decides to read a book, there's no real activity involved, but rather one spends time reading.\n4. Therefore, option B: passenger seems to represent action or activity more than the other choices, since this is the action of a passenger being transported on a plane, hence it's the correct answer.\n5. Option D: fly the plane has the most convoluted wording and does not align with the context of the question, and the other choices do not align with the context.\n6. Hence the option B: passenger is the logical and correct choice.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Note:\nIf multiple options seem to align with the context of a question, eliminate the ones that make little sense, and you will end up with a clear and likely correct answer choice.", "answer": "A: read"}

So according to the question, we can say that, the speed would be 60 miles per hours.\nLet us see all options separately:\n\n1.The option A : 1 hour is incorrect because the question says 60 miles, therefore it would take one hour but not 1 hour\n\n2.The option B : 1 hour 30 minutes is incorrect because it not only 1 or 30 but also a combination of 1 and 30.\n\n3.The option C : 1 hour is correct because it satisfies the question that the distance covered in 1 hour according to our knowledge if its travel is at 60 miles per hr.\n\nAnswer : C\n\nYou can also answer this question by using the following formula:\n\n24 miles *   (60 + 0) miles per hour / 60 miles per second = 1 hour\n\nInput: How important is the quality of the air for you?

Every city: Every city is the place of residence for most people. Every city is also the place of residence for majority of schools. 4. If we look into details, there shouldn't be any reason that there is a school in Prague. So it's not the correct answer. 5. Community: The place where we can find people living.

The key words here are \"machine\" and the \"instricate\" word in itself implies that the chosen noun has to be \"apparatus\" and the final answer as well as the correct answer is B: apasratus.\n2. Option A) Box: a box can be a container, which can be used to carry washables but it can't be used to refer to a very intricate system.\n3. Option D) Wash Dishes: Washers aren't even classified as apparatuses and the word \"dishes,\" for this choice, sounds too harsh to be used in a question asking for a noun suitable to the context.

{"text": "In this scenario the last of the person's money has been spent without having any further use and value to them anymore. \nThis causes them to be in dire financial straits. \n \n### Rationales: \nThe word 'dissipate' means 'to spread out or waste (something) : spend in an unwise way' (https://www.lexico.com/search/american/dissipate). Based on this definition, we can easily dismiss it.\nThe word 'flown' means '(of an item, especially a currency or financial value) disappear and become useless' (https://www, Lexico.com/d/flown). Though it is applicable the answer is incorrect because, in this scenario, as the person had spent all his money, they can no longer make a transaction with this currency or financial value, and it is thus useless.\nThe word 'disintegrate' means 'to break down into small fragments' (https://www/lexico.com/d, disintegrate). This cannot be the correct answer because it doesn't mean when something becomes useless, which this case is after the person is completely broke.\nThe word 'fall apart' means 'to break apart, as under pressure' (https://wwwlexico.com/definition/fall, apart). It cannot be the right answser either because this suggests that the money is going to break, which will not occur if the money is not useful anymore.\nThe word 'penultimate' means 'the most important or last before a certain end' (https://www lexico.com/definition, penultimate). As you can see from the choice, the options begin to decline in seriousness and usefulness. However, if the money lost its value, the person is probably not going to use it anymore, making it useless in this scenario, which is similar to using it.

In B', the subject-verb agreement is incorrect as the verb \"to drove\" is used for more than one person, but it is not suitable for more than one person as the verb in \"Drove\" is singular. A' is wrong because of the incorrect subject-verb agreement and a wrong preposition. \"to\" is needed to connect the verb with the previous thing/person (driving an object) so that it does not mean \"drives\", C' is grammatically irrelevant as it does not even include the \"great granddad\" of the subject, which is needed to complete the sentence. \n\nSo the correct answer is  A'.", "answer": "C: brother's house"}

We can remove the word successful because whatever it refers to should provide some sort of success.\nThe word \"you\" in the given sentence is in the second person. In a sentence, \"you\" refers to the person who is being spoken to or addressed.\nSince the sentence in question uses the first person pronoun, \"I\" is also a viable answer.\nWe also need to consider the answer choices.\nLet's start with A: scars. This refers to skin injuries (usually permanent) that one might receive due to self-inflicted physical harm. This would be a result of committing suicide, however if we look closely, the answer doesn't suggest that something positive may result from the choice of suicide.\nB: being born is unlikely to be the answer; it just doesn't seem to be what we're focusing on.\nC: sorrow is related to a feeling of sadness, dejection, grief due to an unfortunate event. If we commit suicide, the sadness might occur afterwards, which isn't what the question is asking.\nD: misery is referred to as mental suffering or wretchedness. If we consider the word \"successful\" in the sentence, committing suicide could result in some sort of success.

This is important to point out because there is a misconception that an I.Q. score is some measure of your intelligence. This is inaccurate because it treats I.Q. as a fixed feature and assumes that it is genetic, but it is not. Even if an individual's I.Q. score stays the same, it does not mean that they have not changed or developed as a person. This is because tests do not measure all the ways that people display their intelligence. \n                                                                         An I.Q. test often focuses on reasoning and problem-solving skills which leaves out areas such as creativity, social skills, empathy, and emotional intelligence. This suggests that there is more to a person than just one score which can be misleading and inaccurate. Additionally, many people perform well on I.Q. tests based on practice or simply luck, which diminishes the validity of I.Q. test scores as a measure of intelligence. \n\n                                                                           \n\n\n---\n\nThe solution for the above task is below.\n\n### The response to Question \ud83d\udd16:\nA: ordering dogs food online \n1.

The statement \"how could you figure out\u2026?\", refers to the problem below.\n2. There are three factors to consider in the problem and each of them should be used.\n3. So the correct answer is: E: Subtract days (3 days) form miles (120 mile)?\n\n### Problem: Suppose a man walks 4 miles per hour for three days. What percentage of his goal is completed?\n\n### Solution: We should understand the problem by considering the following factors: A) A person walking is moving for 24 hours a day, which is the goal of the person\nB) A man walking needs to walk for three days (3 day) to complete the goal (24 hours)\nC) The total number of miles (miles) he needs to walk in three days (4 miles per hour)\nD) We take out the 60 min. in a hour, then there is a total of 1440 minutes (30 hours)\n\nTherefore: The number of miles are 4 * (30) * 10000 / 1440 = 114.28571428571\n\nSubtracting miles from days, we get 2 times 3 = 6 days. Hence, 114.6 % of the goal is completed.\n\n### This is an instruction that describes how to get milk from a cow.\n\n### I. You must go across the creek once to get to your grandmother's farm.\nII.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple-choice questions.\n\n### Rationales:1. We can see from question that we need to determine where Bill bought his piano.\n2. Since Bill bought his piano, it means that he spent money doing so. We can assume then that he bought at a music store, a university or in a college, or at a home.\n3. We can easily eliminate house since universities are not located there, and also since college students typically do not have access to a piano, therefore ruling out college.\n4. Band is quite a broad term since it includes many different locations we wouldn't generally think of where we would buy a piano.\n\n5. To answer this question, we need to pick the best option given the facts that we know.\n6. So, we can eliminate Band, College, university and house.\n7. So, we are left with Music room and music store, since we can buy from these places, and they are both located inside a house.\n8. We now can answer the question as if Bill bought the piano at a music store, but now we know that the piano wasn't sold to Bill.\n9.

{"text": "1. Identifying whether the sentence includes specific keywords provides the cue to narrow down the options.\n2. In this case, it is the word coherent.

That could be in the form of drinking tea, completing a sentence, feeling angry, and crossing the street.\n4. As a result, the best answer is D: Feel angry.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe word [coherence](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=coherent&oq=coherent) is defined by the Cambridge English Dictionary as \u201cthe ability to express yourself easily and fluently or to write clearly:\u201d.\n\n### Demarche: Answer the question below.\nA: Do you ever feel tired.\n\n### A: I feel tired when I don't get enough sleep\n\n### B: Do you like to drink.\n\n### B.1: [Y/n] yes, I drink.\n\n## Rationales:\n1. The sentence gives us the first word in response a, which will help narrow down the list of options to the answers we give. In this particular exercise, we identify the correct response because we know the first word is FEEL, which will give us better odds at giving the right option.\n2.

Choices:  a: public transportation b: apartment c: business district d: parking lot e: residential area\n\n### Rationale\n\n2. Now let's analyse each of the choices.\n3. We will start with 'c' (business district). A business district usually consists of offices and buildings where businesses operate, so 'c' sounds correct at first.\n4. Next, we have 'a' (public transportation). This describes a public transportation hub where people wait to go to different locations. The options 'd' and 'e' are already accounted for.\n5. We look next to 'b' (apartment). An apartment is an alternative residence, and some apartment buildings even include a car park, so we cannot rule out 'b' yet.\n6. For the next option, our gut tells us 'd' is not likely. Parking lots are rarely within residential areas, so we can eliminate 'd' at this time.\n7. Finally, we look to our initial assessment of 'c'. It doesn't work out because some buildings do not have a lot of parking, so we cannot eliminate 'a' yet either.\n8. We now move forward and see that the only options left are 'b' (aparthotel parking) and 'a' (public transit).\n9. The clues that remain include 'find' and'many'.\n10. Finding (or obtaining) parking is a function of many (or lots) of factors in a city, including the day and time of a specific day, the location of the parking and whether it is free or not.\n11. As a result, it is hard to determine how likely 'a' is.\n12. Nevertheless, we have to eliminate one option per time, and the two left options are 'a' (public parking) and 'b' (aparthaotel parking).\n13. The only location where we can get both the two options at the same time is public transportation, therefore 'a' is the correct option.\n14.

{"text": "The answer is A: \"intelligence\" here because to \"fail\" to learn something means that one lacks intelligence for it. Another term that expresses this idea is \"deficient in learning\".\n\n### Explain the answer: To understand the answer, we need to understand why it is that something is considered \"failure\" in the context of a learning situation. Failure means that an endeavor was unable to achieve its intended goals, and failure can be attributed to many different causes, but, at the fundamental level, an action (or inaction) can be considered to have failed if the action was incapable of achieving its intended goals.\n\nIn this case, the person \"failed\" to learn. Learning is the acquisition of knowledge, and this is typically done by the development of new neural connections within the brain. \n\nLet's look at two hypothetical cases:\n\n1. Jane, who is capable of understanding some mathematical concepts, attempts to determine the difference between 2001 and 2002. \n2. After a few attempts, Jane realizes she isn't able to do this calculation, so she stops trying.\n\nNow, what might this indicate? The answer is the failure of Jane to learn. \n\nHow can we reasonably determine if Jane failed to learn or simply realized she wasn't capable of doing the calculation? This is where understanding the brain comes into play. \n\nDuring training to learn something, the brain produces long-term changes in neural pathways. In this regard, the brain adapts and changes and is capable of forming new neural connections in response to new information. \n\nWhen training stops for some time, these neural pathways are weakened, and sometimes even broken. This can occur even if the training did produce some positive changes - just because we are now incapable of performing the associated learned task, it doesn't necessarily mean the learning occurred at some level. \n\nIn a broader sense, this shows us that there is actually no certainty that learning has occurred, even though the goal of training is to, well, train. There's still a need for other measures of assessment to show that learning has occurred.\n\n### Input The inability to retain. Choices:  A. understanding B. an idea C. to store D. to learn E. an intelligence. \nThe answer is", "answer": "D: distress"}

It's the option that's going to help me the most. It's the one that I'm more likely to buy.

{"text": "Bald eagles, like most birds, live in vastly varied terrain, from coastlines and lakes to forested hills and open fields.\n\n### Rationales:1.The question asks \u201cWhere is a bald eagles safe? Where is the safest place for a bald eagle?\n\n### 2.We don\u2019t really know how safe the bald eagle is but we can make an inference from the context. \n3.The answer will be a place that bald eagles are safe. \n4.The eagles are considered at the \u201csafe habitat\u201d because the bald eagles are protected, especially from danger from the people and other animals. \n5.The word \u201csafe\u201d is highlighted in the question; hence, this is the most important clue in the question. \n6.We can deduce the answer from the context of the question.\n\n7.The context of the question implies an eagle refuge. For example, a bald eagle refuge is a sanctuary established for the protection of the bald eagles. \n8.All bald eagles will rest and grow their feathers in a sanctuary. A bald eagle refuge is also an area where bald eagles will mate.\n9.Therefore, the safe habitat of bald eagles is a bald eagle refuge.\n10.The bald eagle refuge is the safest place on Earth for the bald eagles where they can freely do their activities without being disturbed by external elements.\n11.Most of the bald eaglets that are born in the United States are found in bald eagle refuges.\n12.The bald eagle refuged is a nest where eaglets are born and mates are formed.\nAnswer:C: in washington\n\n### InputWhere will you find the tallest mountain in the United States?

{"text": "(write your response here)\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: What is a person chatting to their friends likely hoping to accomplish Choices:  A. gathering of information B. communication C. feel relaxed D. kill boredom E. social bonding\nRationales: The question is asking about their hope in performing a task.\n1.  We can see it is the task where the person is chatting.\n2. We don't know what will happen in a near future, so we can't know whether they will accomplish their goal or not in reality.\n3. We are now analyzing the each answer whether or not it is possible.\n4. \"Gather information\" is a very good reason to meet each other. You are probably chatting, thinking about the recent topic of discussion. Maybe you share something with each other. It is natural and relevant and reasonable. We can't eliminate it.\n5. \"Communication\" is also a good candidate except for a bit vague when we think about \"social bonding\".\n6. \"Feel relaxed\" it seems likely the one. When I think about talking with my friends, I can get a good relax and feel comfortable. I enjoy this social relationship.\n7. \"kill boredom\" is probably not true. Boredom is just a feeling, but social bonding can affect many other fields. Social network might be more interesting than before.\n8. \"Social bonding\", this is the result of social network. In the 20th century, people used to go to bars, meeting places and then they bond. With social network, people chat each other and they bond, and the bonding is stronger. At least this effect is more obvious on the web version than on the mobile version.\n9. At last, we pick A. gathering of Information as the best answer.\n10. But at last, the correct answer should be A. gathering of social network, especially if it is asked in the internet or mobile version of the site. There are actually some social networks in this website that can be used as a social bondings.\nInput: Why is it important for a student to be organized? Choices: 1.

{"text": "Because the answer involves people, the place where the answer is probably located would have to be public. A military base won't have people there, an opera would be closed, a water fountain is pretty quiet, and while bus stops can potentially have people there, so can churches, so the answer must be at a church.\n\n### Explained:\nThe key here is where people are going to be at the same time and when. So since the answer requires people, the place needs to be a public location at a certain time because the question doesn't say when the jumping jacks take place.\n\n### Rationales\n\n#### Instruction\n1. Exploration of the text reveals the following key words in the sentence.\n2. The given text refers to people doing jumping jax.\n3. So, the required question would be to answer where would you see some people do jumping jacks?\n\n#### Answer\n1. A place that has people there publicly most likely would be church, as people typically gather there at a time and date. A church isn't a secretive location.\n2. However, the church may not have people doing jumping jars, as churches typically focus on prayer and preaching.\n3. Hence, churches are not the correct answer. \n4. Now, let't explore the rest of the options.\n5. Option B: military base isn't likely going to have people doing Jumping jars at the same time. It's simply impossible.\n6. Option C: water fountains would be an unfitting answer as it's no where public and there's no one there.\n7. Option D: bus stop has people there, but it's not a large public place where jumping jacks are likely to take place at a certain time.\n8.

Choices:- A: the price falls B: the price increases C: the fish die D: the price rises E: the population decreases F: the bait grows\n\n### Rationales:- In this problem, we can see that there are two options for the price of fish and two options for 'the price of bait', making eight total options to rule out.\n### Analysis:- In order to find the answer, we need to consider what happens when the population increases. We would expect for there to be more fish, more demand, and a general increase in cost. If the price of bait increases, the question refers to the price of either bait or fish, so we can rule out A and F. The options B and D are similar in that they both increase, but we need to differentiate between price and quantity, so we can rule B and D out. The options C and E are both incorrect; we're looking for an answer for 'the price of fish' and C is a descriptor for 'the fish die'. Finally, the last option is correct and is the most likely answer, but we should never choose an answer without considering all the options to make sure that our choice is the most correct and complete.\n### Response:-\nThe correct answer is B: the price increases.\nResponse:- Correct, B.\n\n### Different questions:-\nQ.-How does the world affect our country?\n\nAns:- the world is different to our country, it is the only place where we are the visitors.\n\nQ.-How does our country affect people?\n\nAns :-Our country is the land of opportunities or the birthplace of", "answer": "B: mall"}

But, what can be considered pleasurable for one person may not be for somebody else, this is not necessarily a good answer.\n4. So, answer #2: \"for competition\" is out.\n5. How many times do we participate in music competitions to \"have fun\"? Perhaps every time when music is involved, but this isn't our answer.\n6. Answer #3: \"for fame\" could be a good choice because some musicians may become famous. But being famous doesn't necessarily mean that the musician is satisfied with his/her work.\n7.

{"text": "The correct answer will be 'B: Sisters'. The given context suggests that there are two married women fighting over a man. This could only be possible if they are sisters and not wives with different husbands. \n\n### Rationale:\nThe given context, \"If you're speaking\" implies a conversation between two people. As the given context doesn't provide the gender of the lawyer, we can assume that it is a man as otherwise, there would've been more indications. Now we can start evaluating possible options. Answer options A, and D are definitely out as they do not make sense in the given context. Answer option B is again not possible as there is an unequal number of sisters and their husbands in the sentence. Let us now look at answer option C. Marriage is a relation between two people, so if there's one wife and one husband, that would be a marriage. So by process of elimination, the only answer choice that is possible is answer option E: Lawyer. Now, if we relate \"Lawyer\" to \"about getting a divorce\", we can see that a lawyer is not going to be the relation you're ending here.\n\n### Input\n\n**Question:** If you've just signed a contract and need to end a marriage, who would you be ending that? Choices:  a) sisters b) two people c) a husband d) wife e) the contract\n\n### Rationales\n\nAnswer choice a) Sisters b) two people are out because they cannot be ends of a relationship. \"What is a relationship?\" you may ask, it's the relationship you have with each other.

So the best answer is B, which is 'overdosing'.\n\n### Input : You cannot drive a car without learning to drive. Choices:  A : knowledge B : skill C : practice D : information E : direction\n\n### Response :\n\nFirstly note that you need to look at all the choices carefully, each has a different meaning. Also the question asks us for what you need to drive a car, so we must answer by ruling out what we don't need.\n\nThe best choice for driving a car is C: practice.\nYou cannot drive a car without first learning to drive, but also you cannot drive a car without at least a small amount of knowledge. In this case the word drive is a verb. In a verb phrase it tells us what we must do to obtain a result. The result is to drive a car, and the verb must use a complement such as learn to drive. The use of the word \"learning\" is an exception to this rule because it doesn't just add new information to the verb, but because it adds a new level of detail to the verb. It makes the verb \"learned\" an adjective to \"learning\", which is a verb.\nBut the reason you cannot drive without learning to drive, is because you must first practice, so the answer is C: practice.", "answer": "A: suicide"}

We know that the machine is complex and therefore the word 'box' isn't likely to work.\n\nB: piece of apparatus.\nFrom the word 'apparatus' we can infer that there should be some apparatus, in other words, there should be something to work on.\n\nC: Appliances\nThis could be a kitchen type answer, but there is no reference to something being complex inside and more likely the opposite.\n\nD: Wash dishes\nAn action here as with A: Box this isn't", "answer": "D: lap"}

{"text": "Demonstration:\nRationales: Let's just consider the first term here, the \"new play\". If something is the go to performance of a year, it's most likely something new. With our option A: admiration, it's most obviously not a performance we're talking about.\nThen, let's consider option B: admiration. It makes more sense to consider an audience, rather than the performance itself. An audience would most likely be filled with admiration for something new and exciting. \nSimilarly, it's unclear how a \"new play\" would result in audience applauding (option C: make reservatons) it. Perhaps if the play is very new and successful, a reservation could be made because of demand for tickets. However, it's highly unlikely that there would be a need to make reservations for a \"new play\", as the audience is not yet aware of the play, and in a way, making reservations would negate the entire \"new and exciting\" aspect of the play.\nSimilarly, a new play would most likely yield appreciation by the audience, though option D: experience. This option refers to performing a work of art or creating a work of art to gain experience. The crowds would stand and admire a performance, but that's different from the performance being the go to experience of the year. \nMoving on, Let's consider option E: sleep. This isn't likely, as the play is new and exciting, and the crowds are standing. It's clear that standing is an action, and sleep cannot be the intended answer. \nConsidering our options so far, the best choice is option B: applaud. This makes the most logical sense out of everything we've seen so far, so far. \nLet our option B: applause. Again, what does an audience do at a performance? Applaud. This is a standout, because when a performance is new and exciting and the crowds are excited and standing, it's likely that the applause will be loud and lengthy. \nSo B: applause is the correct answer. \n \nAnswer: B: applaud\n\nThis is not the correct answer!\nThis is a correct answer.", "answer": "B: applaud"}

The option C:laughter suggests that laughter could have something to do with happiness. This makes sense as smiles are seen as laughter. Hence the option C: laughter is the correct answer to the given question about happiness.\n4. Option D is the same as Option C: laughter. The option D:smiles tells us that smiles are associated with happiness. Hence the option D:smiles is not an appropriate answer as it has already answered itself.\n5.

{"text": "If you are hoping to communicate with someone, then your goal is to convey a message or information. This can result in positive or negative outcomes, so it's not quite accurate to say that you are hoping to achieve \"communicating with others\".\n\nOn the other hand, if you are hoping to achieve any of the other options, then the purpose of your visit is generally to achieve your desired outcome.

For example, options C: occasionally can't be applied to the Computer as it is an electronic device that has no feeling or mind to communicate with others. Hence, it can't work occasionally.

{"text": ">The answer is B.\n### Instruction\n\n>The clue to the answer is \"full of people\" and the context of the passage. \"bus seats\" and \"people doing\" have certain relations. \"Sitting down\" sounds weird. \"Doing\" can be \"saving money\" or \"refusing\" which is more likely considering the context: the man was looking for a way to go home. \"Go outdoors\" doesn't refer to a bus, and people in a bus are not necessarily \"doing nothing.\"\n\n### Rationales\n\nReasons why the answer is B:\n\n1. \"bus seats\" suggests the people are occupying a whole bus, and \"full of people\" is redundant.\n\n2. People saving money is not what makes someone a stranger, hence it is not the answer.\n\n3. \"Doing\" and \"refusing\" are both actions, which are more fitting for a bus than \"sitting down.\"\n\n4. As \"doing\" is an action, it logically follows that \"go outdoors\" is no longer a valid choice.\n\n5. The phrase \"save money\" is not as fitting as \"refusing\" and \"doing\" to the context of the sentence, hence again, this option is ruled out for the same reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: people refusing the man's offer.", "answer": "A: sitting down"}

We can then rule out any answer that refers to a negative or unpleasant state of mind, such as \"knowing\" (a word that has a different meaning than \"knowledge\".)3. Similarly, \"nostalgia\" is a kind of feeling that's generally pleasant and even good, so we need to remove it from the question.4. We can also eliminate the possibility of \"pleasure\" because there is a direct mention of the word \"knowing\" in the sentence.\n5. An answer that doesn't contain the word \"knowing \" and doesn't refer to a feeling or mood is \"depression\".6. The term \"depression\" also fits in thematically because it's in the sentence.\n7.

When the question asks us to identify a place where the dollar would be 'placed', it essentially means that we must identify a place in which the dollar would be put (i.e. inserted, stored, or deposited).\n3. Let'S consider each of the options.\n4. Option A: The cash drawer is a place where we would usually put a dollar, but putting a dollar in it would not necessarily involve breaking. \n5. Option B: A piggy bank would be a perfect place to place dollar bills that are hard to get out without 'breaking' or taking any kind of physical damage. \n6. Option C: The purse is a common way of carrying around cash, so it could certainly be a spot where one would place a dollar, and it would likely be hard to retrieve that dollar without 'breaking' it. \n7. Option D: The box would be a place to put money. That, in fact, is exactly why people keep boxes around the house. They use them to store and carry around cash and everything else. Option E: A pocket is another location where we frequently store our money. You wouldn't put a $1 bill in your jean pockets without risking damage, as there might not be enough room in it for the bill to fully open, and of course, you might crush it in there when closing it.

{"text": "Many of those addicted individuals exercise to deal with their issues, this is because it's a healthy way to release stress, stay active, and burn off extra energy. \n\n### Demostration:\nThe term \"addicts\" refers to people addicted to drugs, so to answer this question the key terms to focus on are \"exercise\", \"healthy\", \"addicts\", and \"deal with their addictions\".\n\n1. \"Exercise\" is a physical activity used by individuals to maintain or improve health. However, from the context of the question, we know that exercising is not the reason the addicts do it - we need to choose an option that indicates \"dealing with their addictions\", so B can be excluded.\n2. \"Condition heart\" is a vague term - it may mean to work on heart health or to use the heart as a medium to conduct information, so it doesn't make sense here. \n3. \"Expend energy\" could mean to use effort to complete work, but it may also refer to energy that fuels things such as electric systems. In this case, the usage is unrelated to the context of the question. If we could guess at which meaning was intended, we could consider it, but since we can't do this with certainty, we must eliminate it.\n4. \"Laugh\" is a verb, it means to make audible sounds that indicate amusement. Since the goal of \"exercise\" to deal with addiction is not being amused, \"laugh\" cannot be the answer.\n5. Let's try \"stretch\". If we take stretch in a literal sense, it can be referring to the body's movements to expand one's physical self, or figuratively, the expansion of one's character. Both of these are vague ideas and can't be said to \"deal with addiction\" to one of the contexts of concern in the sentence.  \"Stretch\" can also mean to be extended or \"stretched thin\", such as when you stretch a piece of cotton fabric taut so that it expands in surface area and length. However, a drug addict may not stretch their mind in this way. Since the intended meaning wasn't intended, we can't choose \"stretch\" as an answer. \n6", "answer": "B: expend energy"}

Is the subject coming back to the location every five minutes or is it just a one-time thing.\n\n\"esperar desde\" translates to \"wait from\", which doesn't really make sense.\n\n\"espero desde\" would also be incorrect because \"espero\" means, \"expecting\", \"to hope\" and \"waithope\". It may make sense if it were from, but it would be grammatically incorrect.\n\nWe've looked at 5 different options and none of them are correct.\n\nSo the answer is A: \"esperar desde un momento\".

{"text": "If one sees a Fox and is standing in a Landlocked, Southern State, where is this person. \n\n### Rationale:There are a number of questions that can be addressed by breaking down the sentence. \n\n1. The sentence contains 3 key words: \n\n\"fox\", \"landlocked\", \"southern\" \n\n2. There are 2 keywords that can help us deduce information. \n\n\"At\", \"In\"\n\n3. The keyphrase is \"Landlocked, Southern State\". \n\nThe meaning of this is that the location is landlocked in the south.\n\n### Solution:\n\nGiven: \"landlocked, southern state\".\n\n1. At a zoo - (option A) -\n\n   A Zoo would contain Foxes\n\n   A ZOO is NOT landlocked\n\n2.

Thus, D: drawer is the correct choice.\n\n### Input Where would you look for a book to borrow? Choicse:  A: closet B: bookcase C: basement D: drawer E book\nRationales:\n\n### Choice: Closet is the correct answer. Closet is a place where people put their clothes and keep their possessions. Therefore, the closet is a reasonable location to borrow a book.\n\n### Choose: Basement is the correct answer. Basement is a place where people save their old possessions. So they are very likely to keep the books here.\n\n### Explanation:The closet and the basement are both reasonable places to look for a book to read.

This is indicated by the word \"committed\" which is an auxiliary verb.\n\n6. He experienced depression. This is indicated by \u201che was suffering from\u201d which is itself an auxiliary verb. \u201cHe was suffering\u201d is the present participle of the verb to suffer, so depression is itself an auxiliary adverb.\n7.

While stools certainly don't have sticks, this response does not fit within the time limit, and therefore it is not reasonable.\n* A 'blacksmith's shop' is a place for blacksmiths to create and craft products from metal, and while they may create such items as legs for a stool, this response, again, does not fit within the allotted time and cannot be assumed to be the correct answer.\n* A 'building' is simply an enclosed place, and in a general sense, a building could house a stool leg-building place. However, a 'building', does not necessarily relate directly to what the options are asking for, which is a leg-building place, and again, cannot be assumed to be correct. \n* A 'bar' would be a place to drink and perhaps even a place where someone might try to craft stool legs, although this also does not seem to be the correct response. \n* Finally, an 'internet cafe' is a place where people could build the legs to stools through their own efforts, if they had the necessary skills and tools at their disposal. \n\nTherefore, after weighing these considerations, the correct option would be choice C: blacksmith shop.\n\n```\n \n### Input:What would come after 188?

{"text": "C: happen anytime\n\nRationales: We're told that the lady is getting worked up over an article that explained the uptick in car accidents in their area. We can infer that this woman isn't someone who thinks that car accidents happen to other people when accidents are unexpected or undesired outcomes of driving. Therefore it makes sense that she's getting worked up, as she's worried about herself and her loved ones. Now let's inspect each option.\nOption A: Happening to anyone tells me that she may be worried about it happening to both the driver and the person in the other car, which means that she isn't worried about it happening at all and therefore doesn't make any sense.\nOption B: It's not about hurting individuals, it's about the number of people that are hurt. \nOption C: Happen Anytime - Makes sense, doesn't matter when you're going to fall into an accident.\nOption D: This doesn't make sense because it is not often, it seems to be quite prevalent where it is getting her worked up.

This can be summarized by the technique of 'elimination.' Elimination is the process of removing the wrong answers and finding the right one. It involves the rules of inference, which are also called logical rules. There are many techniques and tactics involved in elimination of wrong answers, but I will be focusing on the technique of 'eliminating words' since it is the most effective in this example. \n\n### How to eliminate:\nThis can be done in two ways: \n\n* Method 1) Elimination by negation\n\n* Method 2) Reduce it to its elements (like parts of speech)", "answer": "E: happen anywhere"}
{"text": "Let's begin by eliminating answer option E: \"Brother\". First, it's quite unlikely that anyone would say \"brother\" instead of \"corner\" or vice versa (at least not in the UK or US English). \nThe term \"brother\" also doesn't really match up with a place where you'd find professionals who might be involved in prostitution. So let's move on to the remaining choices.\n\nWe can eliminate answer option C: \"Street Corner\". The reason for this is that there's no evidence in the sentence that prostitutes are being found on street corners. It could be argued that C does match the given description in the case that the word \"professional\" isn't included, but even then there might not be an implication of actual prostitution involved.\n\nNext we need to eliminate option A: \"New York\". If they're likely to find a whore on the streets or on street corners, why would we be looking for one in New York? We could be looking for one there of course, but to be in the \"likely\" category the possibility that we'd find one there would need to have some form of logical explanation, and I'm not seeing it.\n\nNext, we eliminate B: \"Whorehouse\", which was an immediate possibility. However, the word \"whorehouse\" generally implies an intention or motivation that is completely opposite to \"finding a professional prostitute\". Therefore, B cannot be the correct answer because it doesn't match the given description.\n\nFinally, we are left with option D: \"Corners on Two Streets\". This answer choice is the correct answer to this question. In the given description, the phrase \"corner of two streets\" makes it quite clear that the implication refers to the intersection of two streets. There are many prostitutes found in such corners or at such intersections. If we were to eliminate D through the process of elimination, because of the presence of the word \"new\", for instance, we would fail at this question.\n\nAnswer: D: Corners on Two Streets\n\n### Input : I was at my friend Tom's place at 8:30, where was I the next day?

{"text": "The key phrase is \"being paid\", so the answer must be related to financial benefits or \"make money\". Wood can cause blisters or frustration, but why would you work with wood for financial rewards? It would be cheaper and more profitable to work with something more versatile like metal or plastic (Option E)! Hence, the answer is E as the rationale states.\n\n### Input\nHow might a baby be affected by a tornado? Choices: \nA: be very sick\nB: get scared\nC: get a scratchy throat\nD: be extremely sad\nE: have a fever\n\nResponse: The question implies that the baby will feel some type of consequence in contrast to what's stated in option A (\"very sick\" doesn't align with being scared or sad, unless they are in pain or feverish)and the rationale is just an opinion on how a baby might feel, which doesn't follow logically, since I've only explained how an infant might be affected, it must be a consequence on how a baby might be physically harmed or affected, which only applies to the question's first choice (\"baby be affected\"). Thus the answer is only A or B: The baby might be scared or sad.\n\n### In this question, both B, D or E are the possible answers.\n\nThe question: What does Mina feel about her brother? Choices:  B: disappointed\n\nMy response: A. Both D and E are the possible answers because I only wrote \"disappointed by her brother\" and not \"feeling disappointed about her brother\". That means that she has a negative feeling for him. Now I only added what kind of feeling.  \"disappointed with her brother\" is a different meaning then \"disappointed about his brother\" because she feels a negative feeling for her brother.\n\nThe question What might happen if you were to eat a tangerine?

{"text": "D: contumely\n\n### Rationale:\n\nInput:Where do you keep your laptop? Choices:  Q: cabinet B: house Q: gas station C: desk Q: apartment D: room E: bedroom F: bed\nRationales:1. The sentence mentions 'keep' which implies a location. In terms of specifics, laptops can be kept in many places. They could be kept in bedrooms, kitchen cabinets, or living room bookcases. However, the context of the sentence indicates that we're looking to find an unusual or unique location, not something that's common. We could eliminate bedroom, living room, kitchen cupboard, and cabinet.2. The word 'room' is generally used to describe a space in a building such as a bedroom, living room or kitchen. We can eliminate room.3. An apartment is usually a place where more than one person resides. This doesn't fit with the context in the question, so we can eliminate it.4. The word 'desk' is the most specific among the other options, but we've already determined that it's too likely that we're looking for a place that isn't common, so this option can be eliminated too.5. A gas station is generally a place of business where one goes to fill up their gas tank so this can't be the answer either.6. We can then eliminate A and B, so the most likely answer here is C: desk.\n7. Let's analyze C: desk. The way you can think of desk is as a place you'd use for paperwork or to type on. A laptop is the same thing, it's a type of device used to type on a computer so a Laptop would go on a Desk. So Laptop = Desk and this means our answer is C: desk\nAnswer:C: desk\n\n### Input:\"What's the difference between a hedgehog and a porcupine?\"\n\n### Response:\"Hedges have holes.\"\n\n### Rationales:\n\n### Input\"What can I do to help you?\"\n\n### Instructions:Complete the sentence.\n\n### Input\": The best time to call is between 1 and 3.

If that is correct, then option \"C\" means: we must have been competing and bouncing the ball AND having fun. If the assumption is incorrect, then the answer can be either one of the two options that haven't been eliminated.\n\nWe can also simplify the task by eliminating from our options the one we don't want:\n\n- \"a\" stands for: having fun\n\nWe now have two options that remain by using the given context to eliminate the answer that didn't fit.\nFrom there, we can apply the assumption again to eliminate one more option:\n\n- \"e\" stands for: score points\n\nThis leaves us with two options that don't fit the context, and since the assumption gave us the \"correct\" answer, and the remaining option is incorrect, we conclude that the correct answer can only be C: \"have fun\".\n\n### Rationale:\nWe begin by exploring what each of the options really represent, so we may identify options within them that do not fit.\n\nWe can exclude option \"A\" out", "answer": "E: score points"}

The sentence suggests James did not want to do something good, implying he didn't want something bad.\n\n#### Reasoning:\n* \"pushing\" implies James wants something, and doesn't necessarily want it to happen. Pushing forward would likely have negative consequences. If he wants to do the right thing and keep his relationship with Jen he could:\n- stop or\n- quit.\nThese are not good things, but James doesn\u2019t want to do them.  In fact, he doesn't want to do nothing to a good thing.\n\n#### Answer:\n* The word \"found\" doesn't make sense in the sentence. James doesn\u2019t want not to do anything about Jen\u2019s feelings and his actions, so \u201cfound\u201d would be something in between doing nothing and doing something good. The word \"destroy\" doesn\u2019t make sense either. He doesn\u2019t want to destroy anything, and if he just quit then he would\u2019ve destroy any chance with Jen.

The others given here (apart from the pedals), if pressed, affect the movement of the car - they control the movement of the car, but pressing them does not. Hence, they cannot be the answer.

We have tried to use the word broadly, but using the word tightly is to be used for narrowing down something. Hence B, C, D and E are incorrect. Option E is incorrect because \"Tough situation\" is a situation where many people feel difficulty in dealing with it. So we cannot deal with it in a tactful manner.

A ferret is likely to receive attention in his owner\u2019s home, because in his home the ferret is likely to spend most of the time sleeping or being caged. The verb \u201cto receive\u201d means to get as a gift or to get because one is entitled to it. \n -The term \u201ctrouser leg\u201d, means that the ferret will most probably be found in the parent\u2019s clothes as it spends most of its time sleeping and being caged in the parent\u2019s clothing. A trouser leg is the part of trousers worn by a person.\n-The term \u201csick bay\u201d is used when sick animals are kept or placed there.\n-A petting zoo is a mini zoo where people and animals both live together. \n-Therefore, option B: the own home, is correct.\n-It\u2019s a commonplace in our language to refer to the home or house of someone whom we\u2019re talking about as \u2018their home\u2019 or \u2018their house\u2019, without needing to specify whose, in exactly the same way as I can say things like \u2018the cats\u2019 water bowl\u2019, indicating ownership without needing to use your name.\n-Hence the only term left is choice B: \u201cthe own home\u201d.\n -In the same sense, you would say \u2018the mother\u2019s hair\u201d instead of \u2018your mother\u2019s hair\u2019.\n -\u201cMy father\u2019s cat\u201d rather than \u2018your father\u2019s cat\u2019.\n -\u2018My mother\u2019s water bowl\u2019 as opposed to \u2018your mother\u2019s water bowls\u2019.\n-Therefore", "answer": "D: petting zoo"}

B: There are a few different ways to say \"how are you\" in Mandarin. We know Mandarin is one the choice but it is not the correct answer for a variety of different reasons. First, it is not very likely that a Chinese speaker would use Mandarin to say \"how are\" in Cantonese. Second, Mandarin also isn't the only Chinese dialect. B can be used for either Mandarin or many other different Chinese dialects. Last, if you say \"how are you\", you're already addressing someone with the word \"you\".

Option C: falling down does not make sense as a thing it can climb on, hence, option C can be left out as a correct answer.\n4.

According to the rules of grammar, a pronoun does not name a location or place, we, however, may infer the location through other clues such as context and descriptors.\n3. The pronoun he generally refers to a person, so we must consider that this person in the sentence, must be a person that is in a city location.\n4. One of the clues to our inference is the fact that Jan went to the auditorum.\n5. An auditorium is a specific place where speeches and other events are commonly conducted.\n6. Therefore the most likely place where the person can be would be a city.\n7. Moreover, options D and E do not reflect a person or a pronoun, therefore we cannot draw inference with them.\n8.

{"text": "Rationales:\nLet's consider our options.\n1. The term \"fly\" is not only an insect, but it's also an action, used to describe how something moves through the air. \n2. The word \"buzz\" is an action verb, which typically refers to an aircraft, which also involves air travel. \n3. Moving or \"moving\" is an action that is more closely related to insecticide than insects. \n4. The option \"honey\" refers to a substance in which insects, namely bees, reside and feed on. \n5. The term \"honey\" does not provide any relevant information to the context of this given question, and furthermore, it does not make sense, given the context of the sentence, which includes the word \"mosquitoes.\" \n6. Choice \"help flowers pollinate\" makes zero sense here, as both \"bee\" and \"honey\" are used in reference to a substance and pollination does not require either of these things. \n7. The term \"help\" does not describe an action, though it is still not related to the sentence, including the previous terms. \n8. So, we are left with \"make fly\" as the best option. \n\n### Demostration:\nInput: John hates mosquitoes. It wasn't the buzzing that he dislikes, it was that the little bugs made what?

If only some police forces help people, then that would mean other police forces are not helping people.\n\n2) All but one of the options are verbs of action, meaning they do something. The action of the helpers is to help. The remaining options cannot apply to helpers.\n\n3) All police help people. This means that policemen that direct traffic can also help people. They're doing other actions, but they're also policemen that help people.\n\nAll that's remaining is the one that is the least likely. Only some can mean some, some of, or fewer, so this gives us the remaining options: fewer police, fewer people, board vessels, arm themselves, or find more drugs.\n\nThe action of helping people is a duty of all police forces. We're left with two options. Either fewer boards vessels, or fewer arm themselves, to be able to help people.\nOption C must be correct.\n\nOption B also can't help people; it can direct traffic... which police also do. Option B can't be the correct answer.\n\nNow, let's test option D. \n\n1) Does the sentence say 'not just'? In other words, are all policemen helping people? No - that would make option E correct. All of them help, but only some boards vessels or arm themselves. \n\n2) Does the sentence say that everyone else out there is helping people? If so, option D would be the correct answer. But no, it only says that only some do.\n\nOption D is the correct option.\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\nAnswer: D: Arm themselves\n\n### Input-Choice Explanation:The above sentence is describing a situation where a child has to decide between several options.\n\nThe key words here are \u2018only one\u2019 which means that there", "answer": "A: direct traffic"}

This suggests that the focus is not necessarily on whether the purchaser is a person at all, but on what radio object they are interested in buying.\n2. The 'radio station' does not meet the purchase need of the question. Radio stations typically air programs about radio, which makes this an option only for receiving a radio program and not necessarily for buying a radio.\n3. Like an option B: \"every car and house\", buying a radio from the 'car' or 'house' does not satisfy the purchasing criteria of the question (in the form of buying a radio). They are only places where a radio can be found.\n4. It is a business that sells both cars and houses, so it will also be likely to sell radios. Buying a radio from a car or a home does not satisfy the criteria, as these are places, not radio selling locations.\n5. To buy a radio, visiting these places does not satisfy the criteria either. These places would only be considered in a hypothetical context.\n6. The'shop' is the answer that meets the request, as a shop is a location where products and goods are typically sold.

{"text": "What do you do in order to remove yourself from a puddle?\n\n### Response Rationales:\n1. The instruction tells us to find how a person can stop being in a puddle.\n2.

We have two verbs for movement (E: walking out of, D: movement) which are not exactly related to puddle removal, so we eliminate the options that do not match.\n5. The other verbs used in the sentence are A: move away, B: laying in, C: sweating.\n6. We can eliminate B: laying in because it is an outsider in the sentence.\n7.

Library:\n    \n    \n            A library is a collection of resources and services, and the structure in which it is housed.\n        \n        In this context we can definitely rule out libraries as we cannot really sit down or even lean on these items, they are just too heavy and bulky to use like a chair. \n        \n    \n    E. Bathroom: \n    \n  \n            A bathtub is just a sink so we can definitely rule this one out.\n    \n     B. Office:\n    \n        The term office is usually understood to refer to an administrative centre, or to the place where an official organization or company carries out its business. The term was originally derived from a room or other area where administrative work is done, and where the writer, secretary, or other such staff stays. The work place has also come to mean a position within administration, as in \"I got an office in the City\".\n        \n    A 'work related space' is what we're looking for.\n    \n     D. Table:\n    \n        A Table is a support surface used for food preparation or dining.

Choices: A: rain B: lost C: lost time D: fog E: got lost F: got wet G: got tired H: traffic I: bad weather J: bad traffic \nRationales:\n1. We know that we had a good day overall until we started the journey.\n2. The question is 'what was the outcome' and not 'what was the reason'.\n3. Therefore, we look for an outcome rather than a reason.\n4. The options A, I and H are related to the journey. Rain or weather problems are common issues encountered while on a journey so these options will not work.\n5. The options D, E and F mean something bad after the day and therefore will not work.  \n6. The options C and B are related to the Journey but the outcome is not good.\n7. Option G is about the outcome of getting wet and will be used again for another question so we eliminate it.\n8. Option J is the only one that is about getting lost.

{"text": "The correct answer is: D) Dreaming\n\n### Rationale:\nAnswer: The correct answer can be obtained through inference. 'Sleep' has both physical and mental aspects for humans. These options describe different aspects of sleep.\n\n'Loss of consciousness' is related to physical states. This process can be experienced during any kind of sleep and hence could be the answer for other states too. Hence it is ruled out.\n\n'Relaxation' is related to the physical state of sleep. It is often related to going asleep but the state could not be used to describe other kinds of sleep. Therefore it is ruled out. \n\n'Snoring' is related to the state of sleep where it is not only related to relaxation but also often accompanied by a state where sleep is lost. But the answer required is more related to relaxation rather than consciousness. So it is ruled out. Similarly 'dreaming' is the correct option since it is not related to relaxation or other states of physical process or mental process.\n\n'Talking' can occur during any kind of sleep. It is not restricted to the state of sleep only.\n\nAnswer: The correct option is D) Dreaming.\n\n  Note: The task may have more than 4 options.

The answer must be given by the words in the question. The only options that use the \"world \"in the sentence are D: far away, and E: near to you\nOption C: Around the Corner cannot be the answer as \"the world\" cannot be used in any phrase that involves location.

{"text": "Input: I was shopping at a Car Dealership, what did a Salesman do? Choices A: appear suddenly B:[C]ottom out [D]own, town [E] roll over\nRationales:The key words in the sentence is Car Dealership and Salesman. \nLet's split them into categories:\n\"Car\" - The noun category\n\"Dealership\" - The \"place\" category\n\"Salesman\" - The \"person\" category\nIn the given sentence, Salesman appears, so therefore it could be either A, B or E.\n\nNow let's try to identify the correct category for the rest of the words:\n\n\"bottom out\" is an adjective, \"downtown\" and \"roll over\" are adverbs and \"go\" is a verb that comes under the category \"place\".These words can be used either as a noun or as a verb. Hence, we need to eliminate any of the words except for \"go(place)\" and \"appear(person)\".\n\nSo the only option that suits the categories is E: Roll over,so the correct answer is B: Roll over.\nAnswer: E\n\nWe could have done better in this question by using a technique called \"Rules of exclusion\".

The word \u201cairport\u201d fails to describe this bag since we know for sure that a bag of this sort would not be used for transporting an individual's personal effects to and from an airport.\n2. The other words given for our analysis are no better because there are no hints in these options to indicate to us a likely location where \u201cthis bag\u201d would be used. \n3. The option \u201cgarbage can\u201d is interesting. Garbage is typically stored in a container which is similar in size to this netted bag. Moreover, we all know where one puts their garbage. Since we are seeking to ascertain the area where this particular bag may be used, we can say that the answer is B: garbage can.\n\n### Ticket:\nInput: A person was to carry a large nettet bag into an airport. This bag would likely be placed where? Choices: 1: baggage return 2: trash 3: recycle bin 4: lost 5: cart A: baggage return, C: recycle bin, A", "answer": "E: laundry room"}

Instructions: Demonstration:Write a response that appropriately answers the instruction.\n\n### The above instructions:Answer the following multiplechoice question.\n\n## Input: There was quite a commotion in the city, people were extremely upset. What was it? Choices: A: fire B: riot C: war D: parade\nRationales:1. We can infer that the question refers to the action of the people\n2. An important clue is the word 'extremely.' The adjective 'extreme' refers to a situation that is most intense.\n3. People usually behave in one of two ways - they either protest or they celebrate.\n4. From these two scenarios, we can narrow down to a protest.\n5. From the given choices, only A: fire and C: war, have the word 'protest/s' in the middle of the sentence.\n6. The word 'fire' generally refers to a protest (for instance, the riots that took place in the USA in 2020) and the word 'war' generally means a protest (for instance the Syrian's conflict currently)\n7. Hence, the likely choice to express an extremely upset protest is A:Fire.\n8. Therefore the answer is A:Fire. \nAnswer: A: fire\n\n## Input: How will a fish go from being cooked until he is dead? Choices:  1. A: Being cooked 2. B: Died 3. C: Being put on a stove 4.

{"text": "Demonstration:\n \nInput: What might a person find in the forest? Choices: A: fences B: forest C: farm D: roads E: water\nRationales:\n\n1. The question is what might be found in a forest, not what is found in a particular forest.\n2. The answer must be an object/thing.\n3. Let us analyze each of the options:\n4. Farm is located in the countryside but a forest is located in the counrtyside/jungl/etc.\n5. Fences and farm are not likely related to any type of forest.\n6. Roads are typically not found in natural forests but can be found in rural areas, where forests often are located.\n7. Water can be found in forests, but what is found does not need to be water.\n8. We can conclude that the object in a forest can be roads or water.\n9. A forest is generally associated with trees but water and roads are likely not made from trees, so A and E are not likely answers.\n10. Since roads and water can be found in a forest we can conclude that B and D are likely answers.\n11. The answer is D: forest.\n\nDemonstration Response: \n\nInput: How was the road covered in dust? Choices: \nA: wet B: dry C: wet D: dry\nE: wet\nRationales:  \n\n1. The key words are 'road' and 'cover'.\n2. The sentence means that the question 'road covered in dust' is answered by 'how'.\n3. 'How' is an adverb and it tells us how something happened or how something is done.\n4. From 'cover' we can understand that the adverb 'covered' describes the road.\n5. We see that the question asks us how the road is covered in dust. That is, we are getting an answer from how (description).\n6. As the sentence is clear about the way of the question to be filled, lets study the option to choose which answers the given question.\n7. The options given are 'dry B: wet C: wet D: wet E: wet'.\n8. Clearly option B, D, E is not true as 'road covered in dust will not be wet as it will", "answer": "C: blowing hard"}
{"text": "B: underwater(under the ice of a lake or any body of water.)\n### Rationales: 100 years ago, a handful of people ventured into water to ice fish. At the beginning, the equipment was heavy and cumbersome, but now technology and innovation made it much simpler to achieve this activity. \n2. The great lakes of Michigan includes Lake Superior, which the answer is under the cover of ice of that lake.\n\n### Input\nThe question we'll answer: What exactly is a \"little black dress\"?\nWe may interpret the phrase \"a little black dress\" to mean a black dress that is neither too long nor too short, neither too revealing nor too opaque (i.e. modest in style).\n\nThe first option is \"something formal\". This may seem like a valid answer at first read, but a closer look reveals that a little black dress is very far from something that is formal. A little black dress is a cocktail dress, an evening dress, and a gown in the fashion industry. Not only do they vary in length and modesty, but they're also hardly formal.\n\nThe second option is \"a formal dress\". A simple way to distinguish between a formal dress and a little black dress is to recall which one is less revealing. A little black dress would not typically be called formal, so the answer is not B.\n\nThe third option is \"a gown\". This appears to be the only accurate answer, but let's be sure. A little black dress may not be a gown, but it is definitely the most modest of any of the answers. As a style of cocktail dress, little black dress does have a gown-like quality to it, but for our purposes of distinguishing a little black dress from a gown, the key is modesty.\nWe know that a cocktail dress is less modest than a gown, so the answer is C: a cocktail dress.\n\nA few words about how to decide on a better option:\nA quick way to figure out an answer is to recall which answer is the least likely to be the right answer. When there is a single right answer, use common sense to determine which answer is most likely to be the correct answer.", "answer": "D: lake superior"}

{"text": "D\n### Demonstation:\n\nInput: Where is one likely to purchase a record? Choices:  Choice:  A: safway, E: wallpaper, B: record albums C : record store, D : car, E: wallpaper\nRationales: The record is used in cars. I have an old album I use to play. \nThe question is saying where one could buy a record. \nI have not seen many record stores because they have been around since 8-track tapes were popular. \nWe are given choices of safeway, record store, record albums, car, and wallpaper. I have seen wall paper, but never vinyl on the wall. Records have a small groove in circular form and is made for music. \nSo if one were to go to a car repair shop to find some music, one is more likely to find it used in cars.\nInput: There were a lot to consider. Which one did you buy? Choices:  The option A: safeway would be a place were you would buy things but not the answer. \nThe choice B: record albums refers to vinyl records but since it is only 10 words, it would unlikely be used to buy just a one and not all the collections. \nThe options C: record store and the option D: car are both valid options but the option D: car is more valid and preferred then the option C: record store. \nThe option E: wallpaper is not an answer since it is not something someone would buy. \nTherefore, the best choice is D: car.\n\n### Comments:\nThe answer choice D: car is correct and preferred as it is the most valid and the only remaining choice we need to consider. We can tell the answer is D: car because the last couple words in the sentence \u201c\u2026record albums on his car.\u201d\nThis suggests someone is trying to find the best way to keep their record collection. They have no more records left they can buy themselves. So they have only two options. They could give the records away or sell them. The second sentence lets us know that they are selling the records. They go to the dealer to sell them and ask them where one could go to get a record player to play them on.\nIf someone wanted to purchase a record from a record player at the dealer, where would the best", "answer": "C: record store"}
{"text": "B is the most appropriate choice for the question\n\n### Demand:In the context of the given question, we're seeking a reason for something, in this case, why an airplane cabin exists.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nFirst, we look at the question to see what might be an answer. In the question, we see an action phrase \"what is\" being used in conjunction with the word \"purpose\", suggesting a function or a goal. \n\nNext, we examine the key points the word \"cabin\" and the words that are in proximity to it. In doing so we get the word \"to slow down\", indicating that the purpose of the cabin must indeed indeed be to provide some sort of braking or decelerating mechanism to \"slow down.\" Other potential options like \"living\" are discarded.\n\nBurning through some other option choices, no other potential option seems valid. \n\nSo, answer A:crash is eliminated as \"crash\" does not indicate \"purpose\" and is not synonym of \"purpose\", hence A is not suitable. \n\nAgain, in the context of the airplane, what slows it down is the \"cabin\" itself and it's used for landing and the like. So the answer is B: slow down.\n\n\n### Other Inputs:\n\n### Input 1:It was at the top of the mound that you had placed the bone. Choices:  A. The mound B. You C. The skeleton D. The pyramid E.

Option B. \"new technology\" would suggest a \"process\" and a \"new\" technology would be a \"new process.\" An agricultural process is not a \"new process,\" so option B is incorrect.\n6. Similarly, \"new processing\" is an inappropriate answer because \"new\" should describe a new technology, not the process of technology.\n7. The word \"metal\" in this list of answers would suggest metal processing, but metal processing is simply a process used in a variety of industries, and is not a technology itself, so option C is too broad and irrelevant.\n8. Finally, the last option E. A new way of making movies does describe movies in the sense of a technology used to create movies, so the answer is E.\nAnswer: E.

{"text": "What do you do with a lot of loose papers? Choices:  a: packaged B: compact C: bind D: tie E: tighten\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question is asking us to choose the most suitable term for an action.\n1. Loose papers can be held together by binding or compacting them\n2. Packaging is not suitable (as paper)\n3. Tightening a group of documents together would make the papers lose their relative \"loose\" characteristic, so D: tighten is not the correct answer and has been chosen.\n4. Faithful is a state of being that cannot be used to describe an action, and B: packaged cannot be used as an answer because there is no object it can be performed on, and therefore E is not the correct choice.\n5. Similarly, C: bind might be used to describe something that can be performed on documents but not on loose papers, so it isn't an appropriate answer.\n6. Finally, option A: tighten could be used as an answer, but as mentioned before, it would transform a loose group of papers into a bound group, which would mean a loss of \"loose\" characteristic and which is why A: tighten is not chosen as an answer\n7. Therefore the remaining options are B: compact, and C: bind", "answer": "C: bound"}

It's suggesting we speak about a plural noun describing animal species and in some way these animals can feel or perceive our actions or touch.\n\n#### Consider Option A\n\n'Lie down' is something animals, and sometimes humans do, but the sentence suggests one is not suppose to touch them, so A is not the correct answer choice. Let's consider the next option...\n\n#### Consider Option B\n\n'Run away' is definitely an action that animals and humans do, but this would be out of fear, whereas in this question the animals feel like we're touching them, so they wouldn't run away.\n\n#### Consider option C\n\nBiting is an action animals do, but this scenario is suggesting they didn't bite us. The animals could 'bite us' suggesting we attempted to touch them, but they didn't 'get us', so C is not possible since we didn't actually touch the animals, that part's false.\n\n#### Consider the 3rd option.\n\nThere are a handful of different meanings this phrase could be associated with and the one that seems most likely based on context is 'keep alive.' An example of a time when this occurs is when you're visiting sick relatives or pets in the hospital or when you're providing care to them. It's a difficult situation that they are undergoing, hence our desire to help them 'keep alive' (or help them stay alive). \n\n#### Consider option E\n\n'Feel pain' is an act or an action. It's an intentional action animals undergo to signal a need for help or their own form of reaction to a specific action. It's not in this context. They are undergoing some specific action, and hence they feel pain in order to signal their need for help.\n\n#### Considering all the options and the context of this question 'keep alive' is most likely the correct answer. \n\nAnswer:A: lie down\n\n### Input:-I'd like you to do my job for me.

Choices:  A,B,C,D,E\n\n### Instructor Response:\nWe'll find out that if it's been going constantly during the day, the answer will be \"exercise.\"\nWe need to analyze each of the individual words and phrases in the sentence.\n\nFor this exercise, let's look at the phrase \"had been going constantly during the period of time\". Notice how it's in parentheses. \nThat tells us that this phrase is not part of the question and is just there for clarification.\n\nLet's analyze the words inside of parentheses. The term \"had been\" is actually a word. It means that this has been happening previously. \nThe phrase \"during the day\" is actually a phrase, so it's not considered to be a question.\n\nIn terms of the question itself, can you find a word or phrase that might describe what the body of the man might have been doing? Let's check the choices:\n\nFor each of the chosen terms, we'll need to decide if it's used in the correct way and if it indicates an activity, like option A.\n\n1. We can eliminate option A because it's not used in a way that indicates an activity like the \"working\" word. \n  > _Example:_ _He could've walked_.\n\n2. We can eliminate option C, because the word \"working\" is used in a way that means an \"exercise,\" but this is not part of the answer.\n\n3.

{"text": ">A: owner\n\nOutput:\n\n### Explanation:\n`Rationales`\n1. In the given context, the head of the branch was yelling at an employee. We know this because the word 'head' and 'yelling' indicates the employer is angry with or is reprimanding one of its employees.\n2. The word'subordinate' indicates that the one being reprimanded is an employee of that sublevel.\n3. In this case, we don't know much about the relationship between employee and employer. So we have to go through each option one by one.\n4. Choice B: owner: The term 'owner' is a title. It doesn't necessarily relate employees as a boss or a person who controls one's work.\n5. Choice D: point: The term 'point' can just simply mean employees meeting place.\n6. Choices C: subordinate and E: base: These options are both employee titles, which doesn't necessarily align with our context which is the one being reprimended.\n7. Now, we are finally left with option A: owner. Clearly in the given context, the one being reprimend is a employee. Since option A: owner is an employee title, this is the right answer.\n8. The owner of that branch is the one likely to be reprimend the employee.\nAnswer: Option B: owner.\n\n### Input\n> Which of the following is part of a country's flag?\n\n> A: Eagle B: Lion C: Sword D: Sun E: Tree\n\nOutput\n>\n\n### Exp\n`Rationales`: - 1.

Now let's consider each given options one by one:\n  - Option A: Eagle: An eagle is never part of the flag of a country, so option A is not the right answer.\n  - Option B: Lion: Similar to option A, a lion is not part of the flag", "answer": "C: subordinate"}

E: sorrowful\nRationales: Consider 1. When you're not glad...it's a logical fallacy to say \u201cif you're not glad you must be...\u201d. In other words, because you're sad and not glad, you must also be something. But the question doesn\u2019t ask what you will be sad, it asks what illness you have. This gives us that answer is option E: 3.\nConsider 4. The words \"Unhappy\" is a noun. If it is a noun then there is not adjective in the sentence. The sentence should have the words \"unhappy\" followed by an attributive adjective. Hence, the answer is B: downcast\nRationales: Since \u201cUnhappy\u201d is a singular noun it could be used alone or followed by an adj. If it is to be followed by an adj, it will be followed by an adjective that means the same. An option for this could be \u201cdowncast\u201d. Hence, C: angry.\nRationales: Another word in our vocabulary that means the same is depressed. Hence, the answer will be A: depressed.\nRationales 4. \u201cGlad\u201d is an adjective. Hence we need an adverb. And the choice for this is \u201csorrowful\u201d. Hence, E: sorrowful.\nRationales:-1. A: depress means to bring to a lower psychological state. Here the word \u201csad\u201d already means a lower psychological state (psychology denotes to what happens within our mind and we are already sad) The same words don\u2019t mean the same thing.

That leaves us with the choice between the ground and mountains.

{"text": "A: opera\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Where are people likely to find a food? Choices: A: opera B: food court C: apartment D:: building E: supermarket\nRationales: Here are the three major reasons why the the answer is 'opera'.\n1. The word 'people' in the question suggests a big place full of people. The'supermarket' isn't likely to provide good answer. The size of supermarket limits the number of people going, though supermarket may have varieties from food court. So it isn't a suitable place to find 'food'.\n2. 'building' may have varieties, but not many people are likely to look for food in a building, while supermarkets and markets have much better chances to be searched for 'food'.\n3. The 'food court' may include 'bakery', 'butcher', etc, but not many people who go 'food courts' are likely to expect to find 'food' there.\n\nSo there's only one choice that can be left. The 'opera' has varieties to provide food. It can be either a restaurant, supermarket, food court, bakery or any types of food that can be prepared in a limited amount of time.\n\n### Input A: Where would people like to swim for fun? Choices: A. lake B. pool C. seashore D. river E. canal\nRationales: Below are the major reasons that answer 'B' as the correct answer.\n1. The question states people swim 'for fun' or 'for pleasure', which indicates a recreational activity.\n2. The word 'pool' can indicate an establishment in which people can swim, such as a swimming pool or indoor pool facility within a building.\n3.'seashore' also refers to an establishment, which is often visited by people to swim.\n4. However, a 'lake', 'river', and 'canal' are not typically an establishment. These would be more natural sources of water, or places that one might typically go to swim.\n5.

{"text": "### Input A: home B: home C: hot room D: hardware store E: office\n\nThis is a typical case of synonyms. We have to find out which one is most similar to the text. There are six synonyms which are: hot, cool, hardware store, room, home, and office. We need to find the synonym that is most similar.\n\nHere are some synonyms for 'hot' : 'warm, humid, sultry etc'.\n\nHere are some 'cool' : 'cooling, chilly, refreshing etc'.\n\nNow for answer B, we can see that it can be 'cool' and 'home'. It means that the answer should be 'C' or 'D'. Now we need to choose one of them. \n\nOption D means home, a house. So we need to find a synonym which can be used to describe 'hot' and also fits the text. Option E is an office so it's a wrong answer. Choice A can be home but it can also be a house. We can't decide which choice is right since the meaning of 'hot' is 'warm' and 'home' can be more than just a house or house.

{"text": "D: way to much\n\n### Explanation: \n\nThe key word is \"usually\". That means we are in a situation where we want to purchase something but are deterred because we are being told about some reason for this that applies frequently. This does not allow us to take the given options in the question at face value.\n\nHere we need to consider what we know about the sentence and what the game is that we are talking about. \n\nWe can deduce that the game is being sold at a considerable discount rate. We also know that this sale is unusual and happens very often. And finally, we also know that the game sells at a high price so that the given options would be likely to apply to this game.\n \nTherefore, we know that the game is expensive. \n\nWe know that it is expensive. We see that there is \"usually\" that limits what we are being advised against. The sentence ends with \"was on sale\". We can logically conclude that since the game was on sale, the price tag that came to us later when we tried to buy the game, was cheaper, in other words, more affordable than usual.\n\nWhen we take this into consideration, we find the following options not matching the given context: \n1. Option A: buying does not seem to fit in to the given scenario as it is a noun that applies to a state of action, and this option does not apply here, as the game is not affordable in a usual state, hence the given reasoning suggests that it was not affordable today either.\n2. Option B: purchase does not fit in to the scenario as well, as it again is a noun that describes the action of buying the game, but the action has already been completed at some time in the past, so it no longer applies.\n3. Option C: overpriced has a different connotation as compared to expensive, but does not seem to work for this scenario. Although for some types of sales, overpriced may be the norm, here the game is being sold in a \"big discount\" scenario which is something else.\n4. Option D: way to much is the most appropriate match, as the context can be interpreted in the sense that since the game is being sold for an unusually low price, we might think that it is too much to buy it, and perhaps wait", "answer": "E: expensive"}

So we need to go through all of the options to distinguish between the two roles.\n4. Let's explore each choice.\n5. The term cooking implies that the chef is preparing food.\n6. The term 'dinner' also indicates that the chef is prepar a meal.\n7. 'Study' doesn't have a relation to food and if a meal were being prepared, it might be cooked during daylight hours when the chef is available.\n8. 'Prepare food' implies that a food item could be preparing, either for cooking or consumption.\n9. 'Thin sauce' suggests that the chef is using a sauce and might also use a spoon or some other utensil to blend.\n10. 'Taste' refers to something involving an element of taste, such as a meal or food item.\n11. The term 'cook' refers to the chef cooking the item.\n12. So 'prepare food' and 'cook dinner' are incorrect.\n13. Let's go back and look at 'taste sauce'. It seems like our answer should be A: Cook.\n\n### Answer: The chef cooks the meal.

Option A is a category, not an activity specifically, in which James might choose to be more personal.\n5. Likewise, option B, \"Handwritten,\" also discusses handwriting (activity) specifically, making it unlikely as the correct answer.\n6.

However, if you were required to perform any task in exchange for learning, you would likely be motivated to do something even if it weren't fun. \n13. Therefore, the choice C would not necessarily increase the fun aspect of learning. It could possibly increase the level of willingness, which isn't necessarily linked to the same answer.\n14. Next, we consider Option D: very important.\n15. The choice is a statement that a person should be doing something (in this case, learning) that is important to them.\n16. While this could increase the importance of an activity, it does not necessarily increase the fun factor. This choice does not correspond with the question.\n17. For these two reasons, we can eliminate D as an answer.\n18. The final choice is A: interesting.\n19. This choice indicates that the activity is of interest. While many people would argue that it wouldn't hurt to learn more about stuff that interests you", "answer": "B: fun"}

{"text": "The king was to get an ambassador, as we can see, the word \"get\" appears twice in the sentence.  The first \"get\" is ambiguous to identify which direction of motion the subject is following. Thus, the word \"met\" should be replaced.\n\n### Analysis:\nThe first \"get\" is a verb meaning \"to obtain\" from a source. The second \"get\" is a preposition in a transitive verb phrasing (i.e. \"get\") an action. In the given sentence, the question asks, \"where would the meet?\" The \"meet\" is a verb phrase (i.e., \"to meet\") an action. Since the action of \"getting\" is mentioned in the form of \"the king was to get the ambassador\", we need to place \"meet\" in the same form of being an action. Therefore, the sentence should be rewritten by replacing \"get\" with \"met\".\n\n### Final Sentence:The king was to met the ambassador, where would this meet happen?\n\n### Analysis 2:The king was to receive the ambassador, where should they meet?\n\n### Instructor's Solution:The king was to meeting the ambassador, where might me meet with an ambassador be?

{"text": "Answer: E: larger house\n#### Rationale: 1. An important piece of relevant information from the instruction is that the person has more kids.\n2. The key words in this sentence are \"kids\" and \"have\". \"Have kids\" refers to having biological children, so \"biological children\" is needed to answer the next question.\n3. An \"understand yourself\" is something that is internal, so \"internal understanding\" is the correct answer that connects to option B.\n4. Another phrase about internal understanding that is related to a sense of self is \"learn to understand myself better\" or \"learn more about myself\", so these answers are not viable options.\n5. If we know that the person \"has more kids\" in the previous question, it is natural to assume that the person has a life partner as well unless the information specifies otherwise.\n6.

This question is asking for something that could be a description as well like verbs or adjectives.\n3. This means that we need to find out the positive verbs and synonyms for it.\n4.

If we look at each option A, we find the word'small' is not used and so is not an accurate representation of the answer.\n4.Similarly, B is out as the word 'large' is not in the options and so represents a room that is not larger than the other.\n5.

{"text": "The correct answer is D: heartburn.\n\nRationales:This question revolves around two important topics - a hamburger and an allergic reaction. An allergic reaction is the most important topic to consider here. First, let us look at a few definitions.\nAllergies are \u201cimmune system reactions to substances, called allergens, encountered by an individual.\u201d Some allergens cause reactions after one exposure while others cause reactions after repeated exposures. Exposure can occur with foods, medications, insect bites, molds, animals, dust, and pollen. Reaction examples include skin and body reactions, and severe reactions that impact breathing or life. The most likely severe reaction to be associated with allergy is anaphylaxis.\n\nAnaphylaxis is \u201ca life-threatening immune system reaction that occurs soon after exposure to allergens such as foods, medication, insect stings, latex, or exercise.\u201d Most people with anaphylaxis experience several allergic reactions and have reactions in multiple parts of their bodies at the same time, which can appear within minutes to hours of exposure to the allergy-triggering substance. Symptoms include hives, shortness of breath, light-headedness, drop in blood pressure, palpitations, and chest tightness or pain.\n\nReactions can involve more than one part of the body and lead to life-threateningsystemic reactions, which can include: abdominal discomfort, swelling in the face of lips, hives, tongue swelling, trouble breathing, fainting, and vomiting.\n\nSo allergies occur immediately. In this context, it is a reaction to an exposure that takes place immediately, within a short period of time.\nIt is also a reaction that is not common for someone that ate a hamburger. Usually, hamburgers trigger none of this. So the answer is not options A, B, C & E.\n\nThe only answer that aligns with all these criteria given for an allergy reaction is option D: Heartburn.\nSo the answer is D: Heartburn.", "answer": "E: food poisoning"}

{"text": "### Demostration Answer\n\n### In our answer for the first input, the word given \"brighten\" gives us the hint that the choice we answer should be \"bright\". We can eliminate the other options by process of elimination. The dictionary has the most definitions and also contains other words that might apply to all of the given choices, so the answer must be the dictionary. We can eliminate C, since \"palace\" is a noun, and D, since \"pots\" is not descriptive - it's a collection of objects. E is also not descriptive, and B is a place, so we choose A: dictionary.\n\n### Let's take a look at a second input. The word \"mammal\" gives us the hint we should look for an animal. Using this process, we can eliminate C, D, and B. We can eliminate E, because \"Middle East\" is a geographic location. This leaves us with A and E as choices. The question asks us to say where to place the mammal, so our answer must be the first option.\n\n### Now, let's take a look a the last input. We want to identify a person in a position of leadership. We eliminate the options containing the word \"desk\". We also eliminate the options containing the words \"meeting\" and \"class\". This leaves us with A, D, E, and B as choices. We chose the options to indicate a leadership position or a group of followers, and the question says \"where?\" with no specific direction, so we know our answer can't be A (desk), E (apartment) or D (prior). Our answer must be given in the form of a place. We eliminate C, as it is not a place, so E is the only remaining choice.\n\n### Conclusion: In each of the given instructions, the given input word indicated a key or relevant piece of information. That given input word also gave us a subtle insight into the expected answer. The question was asked in a directionless form (a place or a person), making it difficult to select the answer by process of elimination or other reasoning process. In each case, we analyzed the options to determine the expected answer. In two of the given instructions, we eliminated five options by process of elimintaion.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Instruction:Choose the answer which best completes the task.\n\n### Response Rationales, Part 1:\n\n### Demand 1. He wanted to get some exercise.\n\n### Rationale 1. The correct answer is D: he put on his headphone to relax and stretch out. There are a number of reasons why a person may put on their headphones when they are traveling on a bus. One reason why a person may put their headphones may be to listen to music when they are feeling stressed or anxious. Another reason a person may put their on their headphones is that they might feel more comfortable listening to music or watching a movie when they are in public transit like a bus.\n\n### Choice D is the correct answer choice for the reason that the most likely scenario, is that the people who were on the bus were quite noisy because they were probably teenagers or students traveling on the bus by themselves or with their friends. They felt happy and were excited and therefore wanted to loudly talk to each other. On the other hand, another scenario that could have happened is that people were having arguments in the bus and therefore because the person who was sitting next to the young man didn\u2019t want to listen to all the noise and therefore he put on headphone and shut everything so he could finally focus on some activity.\n\n## Response Rationales, part 2:\n\n### Input \n> The bus pulled up in front of the school and a couple of kids jumped off. One of the kids ran to the lockers and got a book. Then he picked up his backpack and what?

The answer can be reasoned by stating that he got off from the school bus as he wanted some fresh air. He probably wanted some fresh air to read his book in the class. The people might not be so familiar with him. It'", "answer": "C: listen to music"}
{"text": "C: indestructable\n\n### Rationale:\n> Indestructible means resisting the action of destroyer. \n\n### Demo:\nWe can infer that undestroyable suggests destroyable, same concept with unbreakable and durable.\nSo we need a noun which is on the opposite end of those nouns.\n\nIndestructible means resistant to deconstructing.\n\nSo, indestructible is the most suitable answer since the other words have the opposite meaning and are not the exact opposite of destroyable.\n\n- - -\n\n### Instructions\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: We all know the cocoa that we drink is actually a fruit.

Choices: 1: Arapuama 2: Cacao 56% 3: Bahuahua 4: Camua 5: Cunha 6: Sani 7: Zomboy\nRationales: There is a small error in the question. There are 6 types of cocoa beens and we only need to choose one out of 7 options. So the given 2-3 options are wrong and we can throw them too. Thus the key here is to choose the most expensive since all of the available options are the names of choclates. Let's check each one out.\nArapuama : Arapuama is a type of cocoa beans used for chocolates. According to the options available, we see that it costs only 2.4-2.5$. So this option is relatively less in price.\nCacao 56 %: This is an option which costs more than Arapuama. According to the price range given in the options, it is almost the most expensive. So option 3 is the most expensive cocoa bean chocolate.\n\nBahuahua : This type of chocolate costs less than Cacao 52. According to the 3 cost ranges given in the options, we can infer that is almost the middle most expensive option among the given options since it costs 6.8- 7$. So it is lesser than the most expensive one.\n\nCamua : Camua", "answer": "B: unbreakable"}

{"text": "A: toy store\nRationale: The sentence says \"He called the giraffe a cow, it was fond memory of\", so one has to choose an option that will fit in for \"it was a\" part.\nFor A: Toy store, the sentence states \"Now defunct\". The store was still operational during the time the writer was a child before it became non-operational. So, this option is not likely for the answer.\nFor B: story book, one is referring to the storybook of the giraffe, and the fond memory part has to be related to the giraffe. The storybook is related to it but not in the \"fond\" way. Therefore, B is not likely.\nFor C: great outdoores, the sentence says \"a small child.\" This also means that the fond memory was when the child was small. When the child was small, the place the child spent time in was at least the backyard. Therefore, C is not likely.\n\nFor D: countrysie, the sentence says \"Now defunct\". So, the writer says the store was operational while the countryside was non-operational. D is not related to the fond memory part of the sentence. Therefore, D is also not likely.\nFor E: wildliffe refuge, the sentence says \"was it\", which is the indefinite pronoun. The pronoun is used when relating to things other than the writer. This means that the fond memory is not directly related to the wildlife refuge. E is not likely the answe.\n\n### Input The room full of cash and valuable jewellery, where is it located?

{"text": "D \n\n### Rationales:1. We know the ticket is going to be of significance because there is no mention of the country specifically.\n2. So the obvious answer is D: the different country.\n3.

Let's go through the options in the table, firstly. \n5. Option A: train station- you can't use a ticket at a train station, so not the correct answer. \n6.

Option C: lottery- you can't get to a different country by playing a lottery, so not the right choice. \n8. Option D: a movie ticket- it is possible to use a movie ticket at a theatre. This is a passive verb- you are asked to think 'to a different country' which is more of an active verb, whereby you are making a purposeful decision, where as if you're just sitting there it's a passive action and is not the right definition for this question.

Similarly, the term \"habitat\" indicates that it should not be a specific location that the animal will find in.\n3. As the environment provided for an animal is not a location, we can then eliminate all locations that are directly geographic.\n4.

{"text": "C\n\n### Rationale:The first time of the question, we are only given that a moistener is to be purchased. The second time, we are being given a context within which to purchase a moistener.\n\n1. Option A: The bathroom could be used as a context in which buy moistener, but option A does not refer at all to where to buy moistener and is therefore irrelevant.\n2. Option B: If the word \"moistener\" refers to a substance such as lotion, then we would refer to carrying moistener around with us in our \"purse\" (B). However, it could refer to a bathroom in which we could moist our body and hair with a shower. So we can't be sure exactly what sort of moistener is needed.\n3. Option C: Option C is a drug store within which one might buy moistener, so it is a good answer, but the answer to the question asks for the buyer to pick up the moistener from the drug store and take it home. That sounds like an awkward process of purchasing and transporting, so C is not fully the answer and we will examine the next two answers.\n4. Option D: Hand lotion (D) seems perfect for the situation, in which one would obtain lotion from a hand lotion store.\n5. Option E: Water (E) is used to moist the skin.

{"text": "A\n\n#### Deminstration:\nThe given premise states that John is a human being and that he has suffered an accident in which he is unable to walk or walk normally.\n\nGiven this scenario, it's impossible that John could use the elevator to travel to the third floor of the apartment building since an elevator has stairs where human beings can ascend and descend. We know this because:\n- In scenario, John is in a wheelchai, implying John cannot walk.\n- An elevator may be powered by electricity and has stairs for humans to walk up and down from the floor they're in the elevator to.\n- If John couldn't walk, he wouldn't be able to walk up and down stairs located in an elevator. \nIt's not clear how John normally moves and goes to the \"third floor\" of his apartment building, and we can't assume anything about his mobility. However, since John is in a wheel chair as a result of \nan accident, we can guess that John would probably be unable to maneuver his wheelchair up a bunch of stairs in the elevator.\n\nEven if John could walk, it's still unclear how he usually goes to the \"third\" floor of his apartment. As a human being, John probably prefers to go to the \"third floor,\" which is where he lives, via\na route that he is most comfortable with. However, since he is in a wheelchari, we can assume that John couldn't just \"walk up\" a set of stairs. Therefore, John probably would use the elevator\nif it was available to him.\n\n#### Answer:\n\nJohn is human and has suffered an accident, so he can't walk normally.

These locations can range from the personal (back pocket) to the public (drug store) to the shared (meeting), for example.\n\n1. Let's consider the option A: back pocket and consider what it actually refers to. Noting that it doesn't mention the person for whom the \"small notepads\" are intended, nor their role as a reader/writer of the note, our best assumption is that the \"small notepadic\" is intended for the person carrying the items referred to by option A: back pocket.

Choices: \nA: meeting \nB: email\nC: phone call\nD: social media\nE: conversation\n\nExplanations for correct response: This answer can be inferred without the aid of clues. \nWhenever a significant event has taken place, be it a natural disaster or a world event, or a local town event, the news channels such as local radio channels, television channels, newspapers, magazines etc. would be the 1st source of receiving information about the same.\nTherefore, we can infer that news of significant events is primarily received from the news channels i.e. Choices C and D.\nAs far as meeting or taking in information through the form of a phone call is concerned, the news would be delivered to the people at large through newspaper and television only, not through the means of a phone call.\n\n## Input\n\nHow do we generally communicate with co-workers when we\u2019re away from the office?

A person could keep gold in their home (option B) but the strategic gold reserve is not stored in a persons home.\n\n5.) In the same way, option D states that gold is stored in a chest, which is often a place of personal treasures. But it doesn't imply the strategic gold reserve.\n\n6.)

The words \u201cpleasant\u201d and \u201cthoughts\u201d suggest someone might be thinking about something pleasant, which can be interpreted as someone enjoying something but not doing anything that can move their body such as dancing or running.

{"text": "A. The shark was migrating from one continent to another\n\n### Rationale\n\n1. Let's consider each of the options A - E mentioned above.\n2. Let't begin with option A: \nThe option A refers to the place of occurrence of the sharks migration, not the location of the biologists who found the shark.\n3. Option B: The option B: The Gulf of Mexico doesn't seem to fit as it doesn't connect directly between two continents, as the shark migration needs to do.\n4. Option C: A gulf is a sea body, which is not what is required here as the two options being compared are fresh water and open ocean.\n5. Option D: The option D: television program is definitely not where the biologists found the shark as it refers to television programs, not to the location of the shark.\n6. Option E: A coral reef is not an option that connects two continents either, and it doesn't seem to be where biologist found the shark. \n7. Therefore, it would seem most likely that the biologists would find the shark in the open sea, that is option B: open ocean.\n8. The sharks migration between two different continents most likely took place in open ocean as it allows easy and seamless transition between the continents.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**  \n[https://www.prepsuccess.com/2021/06/14/scrambled-sentences-for-practice-5-examples/](https://www.preipsuccess.com/scrambled-examples-practice-sentence-for-success/)", "answer": "C: open ocean"}

The task instruction is to reply to an inquiring friend who wants to visit the United States. What does the person want to see, and will they like it? The person wants to see an amusement park. Amusement parks are an excellent place to visit with children. Some amusement parks include: theme parks, outdoor parks and water parks. The only way to learn more about what each park has to offer is by visiting each park. I would recommend at least 1 week per park exploring all that they have to offer. It is going to cost a pretty penny. I would advise them to look into discounts and coupons or see if the amusement park offers a family or group passes. I hope this information would help them in making an informed decision.\n\n## Sample Response B\n\nAfter reading this question's instructions, I can say with certainty that this question can be answered by a single word using common reasoning and the word itself.\nThis is the most commonly used strategy to answer any of the NTE questions.\nI can also say that I know the answer to this question with relative ease, which would help to boost my confidence as a knowledgeable expert in this area.\n\n\n## Sample Response C\n\nAfter reading and analyzing the question's instruction, in addition, I consulted the rationale and the word itself along with its synonyms, I knew I could answer the question.", "answer": "D: fruit cocktail"}

Since this isn't 100% clear, let's use the information given in the question to help inform our answer. \n  2. The question states that James has a report to do, which will take time and energy for him to do, but doesn't explicitly mention where this activity will take place. \n  3. So let's analyze each option and determine whether each one is more or less plausible in relation to the above. \n  4. An option can be either more or less specific than the question. \n2.

Choices:  A. be a teacher B. work as a contract C. work individually D. work closely with others E. stay up at night F. be innovative G. not follow the rules\n\n### Rationales 1. Staying up at night wouldn't cause \"the solution\" either to be \"complex\" or to be \"to work closely with others\".\n2. It's possible for an issue to be complex and yet for the required action to not involve any others, as in the case of a personal hobby or project.\n3. The problem \"to solve was complex\" and \"the solution\" was \"to work closely with ______\" are closely related. \n4. A 'teacher' or 'contractor' is not always a 'person' who 'works closely with others', the question itself only refers to 'other people who work closely with others'. Additionally, these options don't directly pertain to solving a problem.\n5. Choices 'F' and 'G' are not likely to resolve a problem within a reasonable amount of time, nor are they a reasonable substitute for 'work closely with others'.\n6. A 'boat', 'truck', or 'train' would be unlikely to \"work closely with others\" as they don't typically perform any kind of work. \n7.

For example, a person may feel pleasure and desire to buy something.\n5. The same way John was feeling pleasure when buying products, so was he buying products for pleasure.\n6.

B_I went out for dinner last night with him.  C_I went to dinner with him yesterday.  D_He invited me out for dinner last night.  E_Dinner was my favorite subject in college.\nRationales: The question asks for an answer that aligns most closely to the subject of the sentence 'A'.\nLet's look at each choice in turn:\n\n1. B: I went out for dinner last evening with him.\n2. He does not tell us where he had dinner. He went out to dinner, which is not what the question asks for.

As stated previously, the subject is dinner, not dinner and me.\n5. E: Dinner was my favorite subject at college.\n6. This is a complete non-sequitur. It's about one's favorite subject, but nowhere does it relate to the question of dinner. Dinner and me are not related as people do not refer to their favorite college subjects by dinner and me.\n7.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n### Direction given\nInput: Some things can be obtained without expending effort. Choices:  A 'no' B 'Yes' C 'Maybe' D'maybe not'\nRationales: The question, by asking about things that can be obtained without expended effort, is asking basically about things that are free. \n2. Based on this, A and C don't really make sense as answers, as not doing things, is generally not something that is free. \n3. The options B, and D address this - saying yes and maybe, they're not giving a definitive answer about whether free things exist. \n4. Hence, C: Maybe is the correct answer. \n5.

Hence the answer is not 1.\n2. Option 2 it might occur sometime in the afternoon. \n3. There can be occasions where the roads get cleaned early in the morning, but it would be more suitable to say it \nisn't ever free.\n4. Hence the answer is 3.\n5.

Forget each of the possible answer options and pretend that it doesn't exist. Just focus on what is being asked and determine whether it's a general skill you need to perform running after a ball, or any other specific attribute.\n2. If you can conclude that a general skill rather than a specific attribute is required, eliminate options A, B, and D.\n3. If you can conclude specifically that an attribute is required, eliminate option E.\n4. If you can conclude both that an attribute and a general skill are required, eliminate options C and D.\n5. In this task, the options don't quite align with their respective descriptions, so you'll have to determine if a given option is relevant to the question.\n\n## Answer:\nInput: Answer the following multiple choice questions. Choices: A: I am very tall and have long legs B: I am a giraffe C: I like to drink milk D: I am a kangaroo E: I have no legs F: I am a camel\nRationales:\n1. The option A: I am very  tall and have long legs is not a correct answer because it has no relation to the given question. A giraffe is the only animal in the given set that is tall and has long legs, and a giraffe is not a person.\n2. The same situation applies to the option B: I am a tree. A tree could be tall, but a kangaroo definitely is not tall.\n3. The option C: I like to  drink  milk is an attribute or a personal preference.  However if the given question asks for a general attribute then it is not a correct answer.\n4. Therefore, only the left hand side options that are applicable with the given question, are correct.\n5. Out of those options only option D: I am a  kangaroo could be a person as it is the only option that fits in for the given question.\n6. Furthermore, the first letter of the option E: I have  no legs is incorrect as per rules of grammar. This option is incorrect.\n\nAnswer E: I am a k", "answer": "B: have legs"}
{"text": "The correct answer is choice D: auto repair shop.\n\n### Explanation: The key words are \"treats\" and \"over a counter.\" Treats is a noun that means a piece of confectionary which is eaten as a snack.\nIn this sentence, over a counter can be understood as the food that you buy. So the key words are \"treat\", \"over a counter\".\n\nAnalyzing Choice A: candy store: it is a place to buy sweets or candies.\nHowever, It is not a place to buy a treat over a counter.\n\nAnalyzing choice B: butcher shop: This phrase can not be applied to \"buy treats over a counter\".\n\nAlso choice C: kitchen: It is a place for cooking, not buying something especially for treats.\nAnalyzing choice D: auto repair store: This place is not only for repairs of vehicles, but it also sells food (e.g., pop, snacks, drink). So it is the correct answer for this question.\nAnalyzing Choce E: post office: The key words of this option are \"buy a treat over a counter\".\nHowever It will not fit in this sentence.\n\nAnswer: D: auto shop\n\n### Input : What item for sale is available for purchase at this store?

{"text": "B: hotel\n\n### Instructions:\nDemonstration: This response follows the instructions\n\n### Rationale:\nThis question asks for a location of a laundry room, but it requires that we identify a specific area that is used by only staff members.\n\nIn the question, the \"laundry room\" itself may be a room located within a house (Option A) hotel (Option B), and a college (Option D). However, the staff only laundry room is more likely to be a location in a hotel, as these are locations that serve the needs of several different people. Also, the words \"staff only laundry room\" can also suggest \"staff only\", as a person or a group may have sole access to an area.\n\nTheres's no reason to think that the laundry room is restricted at all at the option B or D. They're both just hotel areas, but we've said that the \"staff only\" indicates an area that is restricted to a specific person or persons.\n\nFinally, we also know that a \"green house\" is a specific area of a garden or farm devoted to cultivation. It may be that the laundry is related to gardening and farming, but this option doesn't mention anything about \"staff only\", so this is not the likely answer.\n\nAnd the final option, C, is a specific type of green house. So it doesn't make sense that we'll find a \"staff only\" laundry in a green house (i.e. the green house isn't restricted to staff; it is itself a staff only place).\n\n### Rationales:\nDetailed answer for the above", "answer": "B: hotel"}

Let us analyze each of the given choices individually.\n4. The car could not have committed any crime. 'To believe guilty' is a wrong usage.\n5. We don't need to 'direct' traffic when there is no traffic. When the policeman gives directions to the traffic, he uses the flares. They are the same flares.\n6. One does not 'book robber' when he does not book any room. There is nothing to be robbed in that case. Furthermore, it is not a 'book' that can be robbed or 'booked' for that matter. 'Rob' does not have any such meaning.\n7. 'He had a word with the car driver' means that he had a conversation with the driver which does not include waving at him.\n8. The traffic is already on its way. We don't wave at them. We direct them. We don't direct passengers who are not on the roads.\n9. We can only 'wave on'.\n10. 'Wave on' means that the traffic gets clear of the obstruction after it has been given directions by the policeman.\n11.

What to do to avoid mistakes when the legs are tired:\n    a) \"A\" is impossible because when tired they won't be able to reproduce.\n    b) \"B\" is not correct because if they sit down and then they won't make any mistakes and they won't produce more people.\n    c) \"C\" is wrong because having sex when tired will not reproduce, so that's impossible.\n    d) \"D\" doesn't work either because \"D\" means \"reproduce\" in a sense of \"produce\" instead of \"reproduce\" and they cannot produce when their legs are tired.\n3. The best thing to do when the legs are tired, is to excrete, because if they'll be able to do that will they can walk again and avoid mistakes.\n4. In conclusion, the first sentence means that legs when tired are useless and can't reproduce; it does not mean that humans can't make mistakes while their legs are tired.

{"text": "The key phrase here is \"where is disease often spread but should not be.\" So the location in question should be somewhere common where disease is often spread.\n\n### Rationales: \n1. Since \"should not be\" is used with disease, then disease \"should not\" be anywhere at all.\n2. Since the options given are already where \"Disease\" is often spread, we should eliminate all the non-option choices.\n\n#### A: Ghost town\n\nA Ghost town is a town that has been evacuated of inhabitants but has not been destroyed. The place is not often spread disease but it is where the disease starts from. The disease starts from a human being and then spreads to other human beings like the ghost town in the movie \"Ghost town\", which is a perfect example of how people usually stay away from a ghost town.\n\n#### B: Third world country\n\n3rd world country is a developing country. Disease often spreads in developing countries due to the poor living conditions of the people. For instance in \"Prem ratan dhan payo\" Salman khan gives his first aid when Rashmi Verma cuts her finger with a knife. They wash the wound with tap water which is unhygienic.

In this case, the key terms are: 'viola','string and brass instruments and'symphony orchestra'. The \"and\" is a conjunction, which is a connecting word that groups things together.

Choices: 1: bought 2: got 3: went 4: ate 5: ate and got\nRationales: The key words are: finished working and had time. First of all we can exclude 1) and 4) options because they are actions that she did not do after her work was finished. Finally in 5) we can exclude words eat and got because the sentence suggests that she finished her job, so now it is the time to shopping (leisure time). So the only options are: 2) and 3) because they are the verbs that describes the same meaning\nAnswer: 3) went shopping\n\nInput: How much should you do?

Because of the context of the question, the answer must be given based on why a barefooted walk is not recommended after the rain has fallen or when it is raining.

Option B: wet ground, similarly, indicates a location or a place, not the circumstance around walk.\n3. The option C: wet clothes suggest that it's not the clothes themselves, but the fact one already has wet socks and shoes on may be a reason when one should not walk barefooted.\n4. The answer D: start to fall refers to an action. An action is not enough to constitute a reasonable conclusion/answer.\n5. The answer E: water garden implies both the wet ground and the rain.

Hence the choice is ruled out.\nSimilarly, the choice D: study book is also ruled out, as it does not refer to the 'doing' of something.\nOption B: talking is ruled out since, in the question, the 'doing' referred to is 'what'. Hence, the next three options are A: write book, B: talk, and C: play piano.

What is \"the teacher\"? Choices:  1.  A: person  2.  B: teacher  3.  C: people  4.  D: class  5.  E: subject  \n\n### Rationales\n\nBecause the question is asking for \"the teacher\", we first must rule out Choices 1, 2, and 4. \"A person\", \"the person\", and \"a class\" are all general subjects that don't clearly match with \"the teacher\". Therefore, Choices 1,2, and 4 are eliminated. \"The class\" is incorrect because we are looking to fill in the blank with the _object_ of the sentence, not the subject. \"The subject\" or person \"teaching\" the class is called \"the teacher\". Choice 5 is incorrect because the whole sentence would also be true if \"subject teaching\" were replaced with \"the person\". We are looking for something that points to a _specific_ location (not the _subject_ of the sentence) where the students are sitting behind the teacher.

Choices: 1: Gretchen Rubin B: Jane Gardner C: Gretchen Rubiner D: Jane Gardener\nRationales: In the given question, the key words/phrases are the noun phrases \"book\" and \"The Happiness Project\". The options refer to different writers who have written books. So we have a word problem in search of a noun phrase. 1-4 of the options use \"Gretchen Rubin\" and \"Greta Rubiner\" (these two spellings are different in \"Gretchen Ruben\" and \"Gretchen Rubiner\" -- and spellings for writers' names do not vary, because otherwise we would all struggle to find the correct one for a given writer). The options use variants on \"Gretchen Rubber\" and \"Gretcha Rubiner\". Clearly, none of the options are Gretchen Rubin. So the options cannot include these versions of the writer's name. By the process of elimination, we can conclude that 4 of the options, \"A: Gretchen Rubber\", \"B: Gretcha Rubiner\", \"C: Gretchen Ruben\" \"D: Grtchen Rubener\" don't match the author.", "answer": "D: gym"}
{"text": "A: jungle\n\n### Rationales:\n5. The question is asking about the \"australian outback\" being the most odd choice.\n6. Let's take a look at each of the options.  \n7. Option A (jungle) refers to an area covered with trees and greenery, as koalas (and pandas) are indeed found in such areas. The question specifically points towards an \"australian outbback\" being strange so its the wrong answer.  \n8. Option B (bamboo grove) is a place where pandas do often reside, so this is also not the correct answer, as its not a likely place for koala too.  \n9. Option C (china) is where pandas originate from but not koala. This is ruled out too.  \n10. Option D (australian outback) is indeed strange since koalas do not inhabit the australian outback, as the question specifically points out.

So (B): A few hours is the correct answer. The reason is that Anna left the party at nine-seventeen, so the party was two hours long, but she returned a mere two hours later.

{"text": "Input:\nWhat are adult people usually \nexpected to do? \nChoices:\nA: shake hands\nB: own property\nC: pay bills\nD: smoke\nE: talk to each other  \nRationales:\nThe question asks us about the things that adult people are \"usually\" expected to do.\n\nLet's consider each of the given answers in terms of this expectation.\n\n1. The act of smoking (or \"smoking\", depending on how we want to interpret the singular) is associated with the idea of being adult because it's something adults do. But it's also something that people generally do at some point in their lives, before becoming adults or after they're adults. This activity is not exclusive to the category of adults.\n\n2. Paying bills (option C) is similar to smoking, in that it's a habitual behavior that adults are often expected to do. However, the act of paying bills only happens at specific times (e.g. paying bills after payday, etc.) and we certainly can't expect adult people to continue an activity like this forever.\n\n3. Shaking hands is something that is typically expected from adult people, especially in a professional context.\n4. It's also a behavior typical of adulthood. However, a person can extend their hand to shake at any point in their life. So, this doesn't align with the \"usually\" aspect of the question, in terms of being expected.\n\n5. The act of owning property (option B) definitely aligns with adulthood and we could consider ownership as something that a person must have in order to be considered an adult. But the \"usually\" expectation of this question, in particular, does not apply to such an action.\n\n6. The final answer available here is something that adult people \"are\" expected to do (i.e. do it), and we could interpret this as the only answer that fits this requirement, therefore: the answer is D: talk to each other.\n\nAnswer: D: talk to each \nother\n\n### Input\n1.

Now let's focus on the \"E\" which is clearly related to theatre, a cinema or a theatre is also known as an enclosure in which live performances can be shown on stage.\n5.

I don't think playing football always results in death. You are not always hurt by playing football. The word \"injury\" would have a better fit if the sentence was, you get injured when playing football. But the sentence says, \"you feel while playing football\". So C is the most appropriate answer.\n\n### Input\nFrom reading about the subject, I feel that option C should be chosen. When playing football, one will experience lots of sweat as it requires a lot of movement. It also requires skill and a lot of strength to pass the ball and score a goal and so on.\n\n### Response\nCorrect answer choice, B: pain. It is known that football involves a lot of injuries.\n\n### Justification\n\nBy carefully reading the passage, you can infer that playing football involves a great deal of skill as well as energy and athleticism. It also requires a lot of strength to be able to make goals and passes. Moreover, playing football requires a lot of movement and this can make one sweat a lot. All of these characteristics of football lead the author to pick the option B: pain. This can be interpreted as the passage having mentioned that playing football has a positive connotation as it involves a lot of pain and energy.\n\n### What is the answer to the following question?\n\n### Input Choices:  A) a person B) many people C) one person D) several people E ) any kind of person\n\n### Justify your answer\n\nFor the question to be considered reasonable, we have to identify what kind of person the sentence refers to. It is likely that the question is about the people who are taking part or involved in an event, as it refers to \"participants\". \nIf the question was about, for example, the people who are related to \"German Football\" the choices would have been different. \nIn this case, the answer would be D) several people as it is referring to the people who are taking active part in such an event.\n\n### Extra explanation\n\nThe options A, C, and E do not match the sentence. \nThe choice E) any kind of person is incorrect as it does not", "answer": "A: exhilaration"}

Let's analyze choices that aren't the right place.\n2. The man wasn't trying to sell the wristwatch in a jewelry store.\n3. The wristwatch isn't jewelry, and it wouldn't be stored in a jewelery shop. The man isn't trying to sell his watch in a jewelr shop, just the wristwatch.\n4. The man wasn'y trying to sell the time piece in the case, it isn't the appropriate choice.\n5. The man isn'yt trying to sell the time peice in a watch store, its not the correct place.\n6. The man was tryningto sell a watch not jewelry, so it isn't a pawn, and the man is on the streets and not a drug dealer.\n7. The man is on the streets in a hock, so the correct answer is C: hocK", "answer": "C: hock"}
{"text": "**A:** A radio is not of a particular shape, but of a different type of technology. So, D and E are not useful. It's not like a 'box' could be a 'transistor' also. There are numerous kinds of box-shapes. Therefore, we are eliminating B and C. The transistor is just the device, not the radio as a whole. But a submarine is not a radio and a submarine has nothing to do with reach base. There are lots of kinds of submarines and they have many kinds of technology. So, we are eliminating E. \n\n**Rationale:** The type of a device or equipment isn't indicated in the question. 'Lamp' is an object, not a device, which is what the question is asking about.\n\nThe choice that relates the most to the question is transistor, which is in the given options, so we select radio.\n\n**Answer:** D: transistor", "answer": "C: transistor"}

{"text": "### **Course**: NLP\n##### **Guidelines**:\n### 1\nAsking an open question of the type 'where' or 'what might...' - In the given question, the statement where would you find fungus on milk will be a question of this type. The statement is open-ended because the location of fungus isn't specified.\n\n### 2\nUsing 'On' - The preposition 'on' is used to talk about something being attached to, resting on, or covered by something else. Hence the statement where you find fungus growing is appropriate.\n\n### Rationale:\n### \n- The given question is open-ended as the placement of fungus isn' t specified \n- The answer will be of place, so we have to consider all locations (e.g. home, office, etc.)\n- Hence, we can infer that there are many possible places for fungus to grow or be placed.\n\n### Guideline 1 and 2 are not necessarily exclusive and thus a 2-3 line response with additional explanation is highly preferred.\n\n### For example: \n- In the office\n- In school\n- Home\n- etc", "answer": "D: old cheese"}
{"text": "The response must contain a complete sentence responding to the instruction including the correct answer.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The given question asks us where we would find a metal rod in a transportation that most of us prefer.\n2. It is clear from this description that 'bone' is not a reasonable answer. This leaves us with the following to consider:\n3. 'Airplane': This option is quite broad, as 'airplane' can be both a method of transportation and a means to travel. It's not specific to \"what we prefer\"\n4. 'Construction Site': Is a place where we could find a metal rod, but it would not be as preferred as in most of our transporation as it lacks speed.\n5. 'Shops': Is a place where many items are sold, including rods.\n6. 'Engine': Could be either the part of a plane or a car that contains a rod. But this isn't where we would find a rod.\n7. 'Broken': Doesn't fit with the question, as we seek a preferred method of transportation and not just a preferred part.\n8. Apart from this, we can find metal rods in cars, trucks, bicycles, trailers etc. Some of these options are listed in 'Shops'.\n9. Thus, our answer is D: Shops.\nAnswer: D.Shops\n\n### Testing and Scoring\n1.\n```\nAsk each student in the class to write a response to a question that appropriately completes your query. \n\n1.

{"text": "D.\n\n### Rationale:\nWe know eggs, toast, bread, and something to drink are breakfast items. \nThe question says he orders something.\nIf he orders something, we can deduct that the first two choices are not reasonable.\nThe question continues to say he orders something to drink, which eliminates A, C, and E and leaves B as the most reasonable answer.\n\n### Input:\"What time is it?\" the student asked the clock. Choices:  A. It can only tell time. B. It was about to turn three. C. The time showed two-thirty. D. Half past three. E: The time was eleven-twenty.  Rationale:  In the given question, all six letters in the first sentence are represented by one of the six choices. The six-letter sequence is HAPPY. The options in a given question are arranged in a specific way, to lead their target answer(s) closer to the question, one by one. The question was in the form of a word scramble, where one has to decipher the letters in the question by picking the option according to the correct order of the letters.\n\nIf the student asks the question, then the teacher gives a response.\nThe teacher does not know the time.\nIf the teacher doesn't know the time, then we can say that D is the correct answer. \nAll of the choices are incorrect, leaving D as the only choice.\n\n### Reference:\n* Instruction: https://wiki.codechef.com/wiki/codechef-beginners\n* Demonstration: https://media.codechef.org/uploads/2018/6/21/Instructions.png\n* Demonstratin answer: https://media.scrutinize.org/uploads/./134286/01.png\n\n### Instructions: \nInstruction: What is 5+3?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: 5 + 3\n\nOutput: 8\n\n### Answer:\nB. 8\n\n**Rationale:** We can subtract B from A, which leaves us with C and D.

The user is writing a sentence, and we need to decide what punctuation should be used to create that sentence without a capital letter after \"Woman in yellow dress\".\n\nOur solution replaces all words with a capital letter, and replaces punctuation.

{"text": "B: container\n### Instruction :\n\nIn fact, in the late Middle Ages, the people of Europe were largely illiterate. They were also, of course, uninterested in science because that was a product of the humanist ideas of the Renaissance and Reformation. In the Middle Ages, they had to be interested in science in order to do any of the following: \n\n- 1.  Create\n- 2.  Find cures\n- 3.  Discover new lands\n- 4.  Improve medicine, agriculture, and farming\n- 5.  Enforce sanitation and public health\n\nAll these things were important, but in a world where most people still wrote at a fifth-or sixth-grade level or better, written science was of little value. Scientific study and experiment, then, were a luxury available to the few who were literate. The great majority of people had to rely on myth and tradition for understanding how the world worked. \n\n### Demostration\nGerman scientist Michael Faraday was best known for his studies of electrochemistry and magnetic fields. However, he is also notable for how he lived his life. That is, he lived with his brother, his mother, and three maidservants. He and his older brother were born out of wedlock to a poor English mother and French father. Their father became a famous scientist when he married Faraday\u2019s mother; however, the family lived in poverty. The brothers had jobs early on, and Michael eventually found employment in a laboratory setting. As an adult, Michael supported his mother, his brother, and three maid servants.  \n\n### Demosration\n\n\n### Instructions\nIn the 1600s, Johannes Kepler made a number of studies on astronomy. He proposed that all of the planets traveled in elliptical circles rather than concentric circles. Prior to his explanation of planetary motion, the accepted explanation of planetary motion was that the planets traveleled in circular orbits. Kepler also wrote a book that explained the nature of light. Today, his works in astronomy would be considered mundane and not noteworthy. However, in 1618, his work was a significant discovery because the Catholic church was persecuting and killing", "answer": "B: container"}

The tapir is a large (155-220 pounds) omnivorous (it feeds on things other animals eat like plants and animals, but also sometimes likes to eat human garbage) mammal known for rolling downhill. Tapirs do something called chewing the cud. That is, they rechew part of their food. Most of the things they eat are things they have to chew, like acacia trees and grasses. Tapirs usually roll down the hill onto their back. This is called back rolling. Then they roll back up the hill onto their four feet. Tapirs have 2 to 4 calves every 2-3 years. Tapirs will only stay in their parent\u2019s enclosure if they are not feeling sick. They can stay with their mother for up to two years.

{"text": "Ice fishing can certainly be done surprisingly far from the Michigan shorelines in the winters, but only on one of the country\u2019s greatest lakes\u2014Lake Superior. Lake Superior is the largest of the Great Lakes and covers 31, 700 square kilometers. Of all of the Great Lakes, Lake Superior has the biggest surface area, and its shoreline measures 6,000 miles in length. The lake has 28,264 islands, only 30 of which are greater than 100 square miles. This makes the lake the world\u2019s second-largest freshwater lake after Lake Baikal in Siberia.

E: the colors that appear under a microscope\nAnwer:D\n\n### Response\n\nWhile it is possible to distinguish white blood cells from red blood cells when viewing them through a microscope, the best way to make the differentiation is by using laboratory tests as the body and lifestyle conditions determine the quantity and nature of the two types of blood cells in every person. White cells are present in large numbers among the circulatory plasma in the body, as they have a number of vital roles in fighting infection. Red cells, on the other hand, are a significant part, but not the only, part of the body\u2019s circulatory plasma. They are responsible for ferrying oxygen from the lungs to different parts of the body. White blood cells and red blood cells are each made of plasma, which is a mix of water and protein. Red blood cells are smaller, round, and don\u2019t have any intercellular organelles. That is to say, there are no nuclear membranes that bind together their chromosomes. On the other hand, when you examine white blood cells they are flat ovals with multiple nuclei and many small vacuoles that have nucleolus", "answer": "D: lake superior"}

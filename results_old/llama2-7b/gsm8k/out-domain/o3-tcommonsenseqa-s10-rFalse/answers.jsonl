Since the company made 4 miles of road the first day, they made only 1/2 of that next day.\n\nThe company needs 7/3 of each truckload to make one mile of road. Since they finish one mile of road that day, they need 7/3 of 3. This finishes our first day. \n\nOn the second day, they make the other half of the 4 miles of road. They need 1/5 of the entire truckloads for each mile that day, so they finish this way:\n1/5 of 1/2 of the truckload = 1/5 of 2 = 0.66676667\n\nNow we're onto the third day.

{"text": "I have decided to solve the problem with a combination of arithmetic and basic algebra.\n\n### Input from Demonstration:If a shirt costs $15, how much would it cost for six shirts?\n\n### Answer: $90.00\n\n### Explanation:\nA shirt costs $115 if a pair of jeans is double the price of a shirt. The answer was calculated by dividing the cost of the six pairs by how many pairs were in the total. Six pairs would allow the total of the products to be $115.00 in order for $15 to remain for every shirt. If the total of six pairs is $115, $115/6 = $19.33/each.\n\nThe solution to this solution would be $6 times $19.3 = $115. With this being the answer, it was found through the process of dividing the cost of $115 by the amount of product (six shirts) and is the best answer of six shirts and four jeans is what was purchased. It could be done in multiple ways and I believe that my math skills are advanced enough that I feel comfortable with the methods that I selected.", "answer": " 400"}

{"text": "Jim has 301 model cars total. He has 4 times as  as many Buicks as  Fords, and  has 3 more than twice  the number of Fords that he has Chevys.  Jim has 2 times more Chevys than Buicks.\n\nTo solve this kind of question, it's important  to pay close  attention to the clues:\n\nThe clue that states he has 3 times more Buicks than Fords is saying this: \u201cHe has 3 as many  Buicks  as  Fords\u201d.  What does this mean?  It means to divide  the value of  the first  and  the second. This is represented as 3 (Fords) / 3 (Buicks).  When performing division, keep this in mind:  if a   number  has  a higher  position  in  the  division and  when  the   division  is  3 or  more.  Example: How many  times  does three divide into three. The answer is 1.  How many time will  10  divide into  5.  The answer is 2.  As the example above shows,  when a value is 3 or  more,  the  division is done. In my example: How many  does five divide into three, the final answer is 1.\n\nAnother important thing to keep in mind is  when there's a math term, it will always come  first in the clue. Example: For three times: three first, then three times, meaning 3 (Fords).\n\nHaving a good command of the question and the use of English  will increase our chances of getting a high evaluation.\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n<font color=\"white\"><u>To solve this kind  of question, it' s important  to pay close</u>  \nattention:<br>\n  <u>The clue that states he  has  three times more Buicks than Ford:  \" He has 3 times as more Fords as Buys\", means \"he  has 3 buys as much as a ford\"</u><br>\n  A math term always come first in the clue<u>Example:  for three times</u> means three first then three times ( 3 (Fords): 3 (Bu", "answer": " 220"}

{"text": "#### Solution:\nThere is a 5200 sq ft, and 7300 sq ft house. \n5,200 square feet is a new total area of the houses together while the second house was 7300 square feet and if we add these 2 we get 16,050 square feet, that's an increase of 1500 square feet.\n\nHence the smaller one is increasing by a total of 150 sq ft.\n\n### Input2:I buy an item for $54.69 and a bag for $7.34. I bought them together at Costco, where they have a membership fee of $59.61. In addition, it costs another $4.95 to make the purchase.  What am I paying per item at Costco and how much is my total for both items inclusive of tax and shipping?\n\n### Solution:\nCostco, is a department store chain that mainly sells bulk commodities, hence the reason they sell item in bulk, we have to breakdown the different costs from buying those items if it costs $54.65,\n$$54.65 / 2 = 27.33$$\nand if we now add the total price of both items which is $4.95, from the two we add up to the total cost which is $54.6,\n$$(27.33 + 4.95)/2 = 282.475$$\nTherefore the the item at costco is $28.25\n\nOn the other hand if we calculate our purchase\n$$(54.69 + 7.34)/2 = 589$$\nand we add the tax and shipping fee\n$$589 + 595.61 = 1184.61$$\ntherefore the total cost to purchase\n$$( (1184.72 / 2) + 0.49) = 1149.36$$, that is a total of $11.49 $ per item\n\nTherefore, our total is $22.98", "answer": " 3500"}

The top half contains values that are lower than $500. For example, if you put your money on a $1 spot, you would lose if the roll came up with a lower number (that does not include the 0 on the $500 spot) than your number. This also applies to the numbers 1-4. The bottom half contains figures from $500 to $10,000. You would win if the roll comes up with a lower number than your number ($500 or less) but you would lose if the number on the top of the $500 section is $500 or less.

The response script must not require answers to be valid and it must continue on to the next response.\n- The response script must be able to handle one or more incomplete inputs.\n- Test to determine if the input can be answered by a command, a complete response, or skipped over.\n- If the input can be answered as a command, process it as a command.\n- If the answer provided can be processed as a complete response, then output the appropriate response, and continue.\n- If there is an incomplete response, determine whether it is valid given current input, and process the response as a complete response or a command.\n- Always print, but if an unprompted response appears (for tests only), then do not write any statements\n### Ex. Response 1:\n\n### Demand: Hello, Ryann", "answer": " 21"}

There are 12 inches by one side and 12 inches by the other side of the dough, so the area of the dough = 12 inches by two sides (24 in) which is equal to 24 square inches. 36 in^2 is more square inches than 24 in^2, so she would use all the dough to make 25 biscuits.\n\n### Input\n\nInput: I am an account number.

{"text": "4 hours\n\n\n### Explanation:Grace reads 150 pages during the first 4 hours, leaving 100 pages to read during the remaining 16 hours\n### If the total number of pages is 200, then the number of pages read in the first 4 hours is 4/5 of the total number of pages\n### To calculate the number of pages read during the remaining 4 hours, all we need is to divide the remaining number of pages, by the remaining number of hours, since the number of pages read each hour is the same. So, for the remaining 16, the number of pages read, is 4/16  or 12/32 pages, because each hour corresponds to the 5th hour.\n### So, the number of pages she reads the remaining 4 hours is (4/5)(100) = 12/35 = 12/18 = 6/9 pages\n### Thus, she finishes the book in 4 hours, by reading (4/5)(200) (pages) = 80 pages during the first four hours and then reading (12/18)(250) = 150 pages, the other 150 pages the remaining 4 hours.\n\n\n### Feedback:\n**Good:** Your response provides the instructions to calculate hours to read book while the answer is correct.

Her first child is a girl. What is the probability that the next child after Rainbow\u2019s first child will also be a girl? Explain.\n\n### Response\uff1aLet us say the girl in Rainbows first child is called Alisa. Now Rainbow could have 8 sons, 7 daughters or a mixture of both. Let us pick the mixture of children with probability of 1/16. So Rainbow has 1/16 probability of having 8 boys and a 1/16 of having 7 daughters and 1/16 chance of a mixture. We call this result 3/16. Let us continue to call the probability of having 8 sons and 7 daughters: 1/32. We continue to have 1/2 of having a mixture: 1/8. So the total outcome = 1/32 + 1/32 and 1/2. We now have to divide the sum of the probabilities by the number of possible outcomes which are the kids in Rainbows offspring. So we divide 365+129+1/2 which gives us the result of 503/365 = 3.33.\n\nThis means you have a 3/16 probability of getting a boy as a result, 1/32 probability of getting a girl as a result and a 1/8 of getting a mixture (boy and girl). So the probability of getting a girl, is the probability of getting the mixture of boys and girl is: (1/8+1/32) which equals: 1/24 = 0.0417\n\n### Input You can use the formula below to estimate the number of years you expect to live.

{"text": "8 hours\n\n### Input\nLearning objective: Understand how to find the surface area of a 3-dimensional object(in this case a rectangular box)\n\nWe can find the surface area of an object via breaking the area into smaller components and adding these components together. Let's look at the diagram below and then we'll use these steps to solve the problem.\nWe know the length and width of the box and the height of the box is unknown. For the top of the box, we have a 6x5 rectangle which the 6 and the 5 represent length, so we have 45 on top of the box and the 2x6 rectangle that makes up the sides also has 45 and another 5 at each of the sides for a total of 50 on the sides.  This gets us a surface area of 45 + 45 + 50 +50 which equals 170. As we move to the bottom, we have the bottom corners that are 25 squares each, these square off and add to the sides of the bottom 45 at each end, this gives us 45 + 25 which is 70 to the total surface area of the box.\n\n### Output\n170 + 70 = 240 sq. inches\n### Challenge:What's the surface area of a box that is 8x8x7?\n\n### Instructions:You need to do the following calculations  in a table.

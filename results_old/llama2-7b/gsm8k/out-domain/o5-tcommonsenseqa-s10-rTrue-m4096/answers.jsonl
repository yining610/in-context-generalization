{"text": "$24;$12.50\n\n### Instructor Response:Great!\n\n### Input:[{\"author\":\"\",\"body\":\"What is a common cause of the 2nd largest population of firemen in the US? Choices: 1. house fire 2. trash fire 3. forest fire 4. chemical explosion 5. car fire\nRationales:1. The question asked about an action or thing that causes the second most massive amount of firemen being needed to respond to a fire.\n2. Choice A, house fire, is what most people associate with firemen and their actions in stopping houses from being damaged by fire. However, house fire is not always the biggest reason firemen are needed.\n3. Choice B, trash fire, is another occurrence causing firemen to step in and mitigate damages. Most trash fires will quickly extinguish themselves though. Not all trash fires could lead to a need for firemen.\n4. Similar to the trash fire in choice B, a choice C forest fire, could also require firemen to respond and contain the fires before damages escalate or become irreversible. \n5. However, choice C forest fire is specific to the context of fires that started within a forest and as more and more forests have been cleared, the number of forest fires have grown. This makes choice C forest fire less likely to be the cause of the second most massive amount fires that have required firemen's actions. \n6. In contrast with options A, B, and C, choice D, chemical explosion could cause massive fire damage, especially if it's in a populated area. This makes chemical explosion a possible answer as a cause for the second most massive amounts of firemen needed to respond.\n7. Finally, though less commonly known, choice E car fire is also a reason why firemen step in to put out large fires and damages. \n8. Given all that, it is likely that a combination of all choices would be the reason why the 2nd most massive numbers of firemen is needed. However, choosing between 1) house fire, 2) trash fire, 3) forest fire, and 4) chemical explosion is going to be somewhat biased. \n9. Thus, the only neutral, non-biased answer is A:", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "Stella and Twinkle filled half of the truck in three hours. Thus, they finished the truck in six extra hours with 6 more people.  Hence, it took 9 hours to fill the truck.\n\n### Response rationale: The first thing to note is the rate per person. The text states that the two people fill up the truck at a rate of 25 per person per hour.\n4. Given this rate per hour, Stella and Twinkles working for four hours means they could fill a total of 4 x 25 = 100 blocks.\n7. This means Stella and Twinke could fill the entire truck in 100/6000 = 0.016667 = 1.67 hours.\n8. When six more people join them to work, it would take an additional 6 x 25, or 10 more hours to finish. But the truck is already 1/6000th full. This means the new group will fill what\u2019s left to finish the truck in one hour.\n9. Given that they worked four hours, Stella and Twinnel are 4 x 6000 =24000 stone blocks below filling the truck.\n10. To make up for the missing 24000 blocks, the new group needs to fill the remaining 6000/24000 = 1/4 of the blocks in 1 hour.\n11. To finish in the original timing, the new group needs 1/24 = 1/48 hours more, bringing it to 5 more hours.\n12. In total, it will take 9 hours to fill up the truck.\n### Summary: We use the information provided by the text to determine the rate per hour. After finding the rate per hour we can find out how many hours it takes to fill up the trun. Then we use division and ratios to find how many blocks were left to fill in order to do the problem. After calculating the remaining blocks we must find the amount to divide the remaining by and finally add the resulting product to the original time to solve the problem.", "answer": " 6"}

From this scenario, we can derive that the growth of Haley's height depends on Haley's current age and it grows by a fixed number every year.\n\nAssuming the given scenario holds, Haley's future height will be 3a years. For example, after getting to age 5 and Haley's growth rate remains at 3 inch per year her height after 5 years of age is 15 inch.\n\nSo, if Haley is currently(a years) old and after ten years she will be( _a_ years+10), her future height is 40.\n\nFor example, if Haley was currently 2 years old, it means after ten years her height would be 30.\n\nIn this way, the correct answer of Haley' first growth after 10 year will be 30 or 40.

What is the net profit?\n\n### Demons tration:\nInput: Each customer receives a free cone and gets 6th cone for free.\nRationales: Here for every 6th customer we get 6th cone for FREE and in total we sell $100 worth cones. Hence 14 cones for sale and 6 for free. The total number of cones we sell is 14 + 6 = 20 (14 cones for $100) and we made $150 profit after deducting Cost ($149.80). And net profit made is ($150-$149.8) and that is $1.2.\n\n### Response;\nInput: Dan owns an e ice cre am shop and every sixth customer geta a free cone. If he sold $72.25 worth of cones, what was the net profit?\nRationales:Dan sell cones when every sixth customer gets a FREE cone. So, 6 cones are given FREE per batch of 15. So, 15 - 6 = 9 cones are sold on an average and the cost of 15 cones is $72.26.

{"text": "Given the instructions:\nThere are 40 children in a class. If one tenth is absent, three fourth out of all students who are present are studying in the classroom and the rest are in canteen. How many students are in the classroom?\nRationale:To begin, we will need to figure out how to find the number of students in the classroom:\nTo account for the tenth of students that are absent, we can apply the equation:\nS = P + Q - R\nS: Number of students in total\nP: Number of students present\nQ: Number of students absent\nR: Number of students present and absent\nSince S = 40\nP + Q - R = 40\n0.1 = 40\nSo 40 - 0.1 = 39.9\nThere are 39.9 students present.\nThen we will use the P - R substitution method to figure out how many students are in each room:\nS = P - Q = (39.9) - (0.1) = 39.8\nP - Q = (9.9) - 0 - 1 = 8.9\nP - R = (29.6) - (0.4) = 29.2\nWhen we can't solve the P - R equation, we can also plug it in to the substitution method.\nWe can plug in 29.6 in the second equation above:\nS - Q - P\nThe classroom contains all students when there are a total of 39.8 students present + 0.4 students absent, therefore the classroom contains 39.8+0.4 = 40.2 students.\nThe answer is D: 40.2\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer question 1.\n\nOne thing to note with these examples is that the instructions may not always give a context for the questions.

The distance is 55 miles.\n2. To get that distance to make it an hour and 56 minutes, the distance is multiplied by the average speed.\n3. Since the bus driver can drive 1 mile per 2 minutes.\n4. So, the bus driver will drive 10 miles to get to the second destination.\n\n### Steo 2: The bus driver can drive faster by going at 2 minutes per 1 mile.\n\n1. Since they drove 10 miles farther by the bus driver can drive faster per mile than the average of 2 minutes per 2 miles.\n2. So they can increase the speed to 2 minutes per 4 miles.\n\n### Summary: If we can just do the conversion:\n\n1. 55 miles at 2 minutes per miles = 2 minutes per 55 miles\n2. 10 miles farther at 2 minutes per mile = 2 minutes per ten miles\n3.

{"text": "Thor Is 1456 Years Old\n\n1. We can observe that \"7 times older than Peter\" does not mean 7x more years, as this is the number of years that have passed, not the absolute age. That would be 7, but it is not the same thing.\n2. So, in this case, \"Peter Parker\" has been on Earth for years with Iron Man. 7x more than Peter Parker or 7x older than Peter Parker means that Iron Man 7x older than Thor is (the same Peter Parker). 7 years older than Peter Parker means 7 different Thor would be 32+7x or 7+39 years.\n3. \"7x more years\" or \"7x older\" means that Iron Man was 7x older / x times more older than Thor. Thor is 7x more / older. \"32x older / older\" is not the only way to understand it.\n4. Thor is 13x older / older than Captain America. 13x older than Captain America means Thor was 13x Captain America. Captain America was 13x older Than Thor.\n5.

{"text": "Jan would have a total of around 4500 feet of cable left.\n### Explanation:We can start off by understanding that there are 25 feet in each section of cable.  That means that Jan bought 40 entire sections of cable, which comes out to be 1000 * 25 = 25000 feet of total cable.  For this calculation, we'll be working with whole sections because if you divide sections up the cable by the 1/4 then you would run into fractions and it gets more tedious.  So Jan first cut 1000 sections of cable and she now has 2500 sections left.  Then Jan gives away 1250 pieces and is left with 1250 - 1250 = 0 sections and so she has 0 - 12.5 = 22.5 left.  If she gives away 1/4 and she has 1/4 left then you need to subtract those 1/4 out.  Since she has 22.5 sections left and she is left with 1/4 (1/4 x 22.5/22.5) left, which is 1/4 * 6 = 3 sections left.\n\n### Input:(6 * 3) * (8 - 4) = 8\n\n### Demostration:\nTo work this question out, use the associative property and multiply the numbers together to get your answer.

How many cats are there altogether?\n\n### Analysis:\nThe best solution for this situation comes from simple mathematical logic. First, we have to separate them into two equations. Since there are 10 more than each cat in every cage, we have to work with the amount of each cat first. It could be assumed that an average cat weighs around 3 pounds, or 1.36 kilograms. Using 1.36 as the average and considering that there are 10 cats in each cage, 10x1.36=13.6 pounds, or 6.18 kilograms. In this situation, as it was asked, 10 more than 50% of this amount is 25. Using this knowledge, we know that after adding 50% of the average cat, the sum (50%+13.6) is equal to 19.2, then 25 is equal to 25. 25-19.2 is equal to 5.8. This means after calculating 5.8 kilograms as half of 13.6(10 more than each), it is possible to find more than half of 5.8 kilos is 5.8+5.8(10 more than 1.75) is equal to 2.66. Then we multiply 2.66 to 5.8(more than half) to arrive at 16.36 (the final number). The amount of cats in 10 more than the half of the cat in each cage then, is 64.36 kilos.\n\n### Analysis", "answer": " 99"}

Mike's salary would be 100x greater than Fred's salary, which implies that Mike's salary was at least $10,000 at the time. Since Mike is now earning \"10 times\" more than before, it means his salary is now 10x, or $10,0,000 greater than before, making his salary now at least $100,000. \n\n3. Since Mike's increase of 40% of $40,000, it means he will have an increase of 20%, or $8,000. By subtracting this from Mike's salary of 100,0%, means that Mike's salray will be an increase of 80%. \n\n4. Mike's increase was either at $16,000, which is too high. So the correct answer would be Mike now has a salary of $108,000, or $108,400 which is within 80-90% of the correct answer.\n### Suggestions for further learning:\n* **You must learn the vocabulary and the syntax of a language**", "answer": " 15400"}

So, they decided to divide them evenly with their other 8 friends. How many dougnuts will each person receive per person?\n\n### Rationales:\nIn this question the question was asked about how many doughnuts each person will receive. Therefore, we will be dividing by eight. If we take the two numbers the answer will be 12, 16, 12 and 16 again.

{"text": "331-223=108\n\n### Explanation: \nThe key to this problem is to find how many dust particles were before sweeping, knowing that 108 was left after sweeping the porch. \n\n1. First, you need to understand the problem and figure out what to do. You know there are 331 dust particles remaining on the porch after Samuel swept it. In other words, he successfully cleared about 9/10 of the dust.\n2. In order to find how many dust must be on the porch originally, remember that every time you subtract, you must subtract a larger number from a smaller number. In this case there are 108 more dust particles now than there were before; there must be more of before too.\n3. Next, you have to understand what you don\u00b4t know. In this case, you don't know how many dust particles were on before Samuel swept. \n4. You can break the problem into more pieces. First subtract how many dust particles Samuel walked across and you are left with how many dust particles before he left. \n5. From here, your next goal is to find how many were left after Samuel swept.\n6. To find how many dust particles Samuel collected across the porch you need to use the answer from the first step.\n7. So, you can calculate how many dust particles before sweeping by simply subtracting the number Samuel left after sweeping. In this case you get 331-108=223.\n8.

The teacher invites their students to join in planning the gift and ten students and one teacher decide to purchase a gift together.\n2.

Later, four of the ten students decide they do not want to purchase the gift anymore, leaving the six remaining. They decide that each of the remaining six students will now be responsible for purchasing the gift alone. But this will require them each to pay $8 more per share since the initial cost was $50 each share now $58 each.\n4. So, to determine the cost of the gift for the six remaining, I divide $50 by 6, which is $8. There are 6 of them together, so each of them will be responsible for $8 towards purchasing the gift.\n5.

To do this we could take the 42 feet and divide it by the width of the boat. That gives us 42/3 = 14.\n* Secondly, we need to find how many boats are needed to sail through that river with the restriction. By doing so we need to find the number of boats needed to have a minimum of 2 foot distance between the boat and the river bank. To do so we take the width of the river of 42 feet, take the distance needed between the boat and river bank of 2 feet, and take the width of the boat of 3 feet, so we get 42 \u2212 2 = 40.42 \u2212 2\u22c5 3 = 38.22 feet = 1 foot.\n* Finally, we need to translate the result into our unit of measures used and say that one boat per foot of the river can use our river.\nAnswer: As many as 17 boats can race the river.\n\n### How many letters are there in the following words?\n\n### The word:\n15\n\n### The answer:\n15\n### Input:\n```golang\n62\n\nThe word:\n\n14\n```\n\n### The Answer:\n```goland\n14\n```", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "A: 442. To begin with, we can observe that the number of legs the single spider will have should be twice the number of legs the entire group of spiders will have. To find the total number of legs in the group of spiders, we can subtract the number of legs the group will have from that number to get the number of legs. By applying these facts, the answer is A.\n\n### Input\nHow are most of the spiders in a group more legs than a single spider?\n\n### Answer\nThey have twice as many legs as the single spider and are multiplied by the count of individuals in the group.\n\n### Rationale: The correct answer is A. By applying the facts that the number of legs a single spider will have and the total legs a single spider contains twice the legs in the group, one can easily see the numbers are in proportion and should equate to an addition of the number in the group to the number with twice the leg count.\n\n### Solution\n\nI see that the answer is 442. So the group of spiders will contain 2 x (Total Number of Spiders in group) Legs.\n\nI see that each spider individually has 8 legs.\n\nSo the total legs of the group of spiders when added together will be 2 x (Total number of spiders in group)\n\nSo let\u2019s say there is a small group containing 90 spiders. Then the correct answer would be 2 * (90)\n\nI see that this is 180 legs in all.\n\nWhich makes perfect sense because one spider has 8 legs and 90 spiders will together make 180 legs.\n\nSo to sum it all up. The formula to use in solving problems related to the number of legs on most spiders in a group is:\n\nNumber of Legs of spiders = 2 x (Total # of Spiders in the group)\n\n### Rationales for Solution\nI saw that by counting the legs a single spider has then you can multiply the number of spiders in a group by that amount. In our example we have a group of 90 spiders which can be multiplied by the 8 which that each Spaid has as his number of legs.\n\n### Other Thoughts", "answer": " 112"}

Jillian collected the highest number of shells, which means that Jillian should receive the most amount of shells. In this case, Jillian received 11 shells. \n\nThen, Savannah will have 29-11=18 shells. We get the total number of shells Savannah received by subtracting the number of shells that Jillian received (11) and then multiplying the result by 2. Savannah should receive twice the number of shells as Jillian.\n\nNow Clayton received 0 shells. He must receive one shell.\n\nAnswer: - The key to solving this problem is to understand the logic behind dividing the shells and distributing them evenly. When we divide two friends, we want to give each friend an equal number of shells. Jillian collected more shells than Savannah and Clayton, and since Savannah and Clay ton received shells evenly, Jillian should receive more shells than the other two.\nTo solve the problem, let's write a code on a computer to help us add the shells and divide them evenly, we can use an excel file.

I think we should listen five times more.\"\n\n### Response:\"Your teacher probably made the comment for a few reasons. Firstly, people who aren't usually quiet or reserved may speak twice the amount of times as those who are quiet or reserved. So, instead of the relatively quiet students having to bear the stress of speaking all day because the other students talk so much, the extra time is needed for quiet people to speak up too. Secondly, to prevent students from interrupting one another when they speak out, your teacher made it fair for both to speak. And last but not least, it's a courtesy to listen more fully as a kind of reciprocity when someone else is speaking. So, your teacher likely made this suggestion to encourage you to interact more with the other students in class, and to practice better listening skills as well.\n\n### Rationale:1. First, we evaluate each choice based on whether it would support or disprove the sentence. While they all begin with the word \u201cwhy\u201d, each choice is phrased differently, so we can discount any that are unlikely to be the right answer.\n2. Choice B implies that the sentence itself is false as it says \u201cWhy your teacher says.\u201d A sentence structure like this would contradict the statement and be inaccurate as what is written should instead say \u201cmy teacher says\u201d.\n3. Choice D is another inaccurate choice as it references a statement entirely different from what is written. This choice is out of scope given the sentence, and we can disregard it.\n4. Choices E and G do not contain anything substantial relevant to the sentence, so eliminating them as well.\n5. Choices C and F make statements regarding what is written itself, and as they both contain valid assertions they are both likely options.\n6. However, C gives a detailed explanation with several rationale of why you think your teacher should say that you should listen twice more, which is clearly the wrong answer choice.\n7.

Then we will have n00005 + nx50, where n0000 is the cost of printing the manuscript without binding and nx50 is the cost of the binding that you do, where the binding costs 50 per book. Let\u2019s say that n is the copy that you want to do. We need to find n0000 and nx50, solving n0000 = 1 and nx50 = n\n\nn is then 400\nLet\u2019s calculate the number of binding so that we can find the sum of 115.\n\nnx50 = 400\n\n50n = 2000\n\nn = 40, which is an integer\n\nSo, printing is 400 + 400 = 800\n\nAnd binding is 40*50 = 200\n\nThe total cost is\n\n105.5 + 200 = 295.5\n\n### Input & Context - Choice D is the best answer to the given question because the price of the book will increase if the supply of oil will increase.

{"text": "Input:Julia is performing the musical and her family wants to go to the show. A total of 4 tickets are needed for their attendance. The question then asks the amount of money the total tickets will cost.\n\n### Rationale:\nThis is a direct response to the question that asks about the cost of 4 tickets. If we divide the ticket price for adults and children by each in addition to a multiple of the total tickets we will arrive at the right solution. Here is how we do it:\n\nTicket price per adult is $ 12 and per child $ 10\n* 8 tickets = total tickets needed\nAdult ticket: $ 12\nChild ticket: $ 10\n  - $ 12 * 2 = $ 24 (total amount for 2 adult tickets)\n  - $ 24 + $ 10 * 6 = $ 100 (total amount for 1 kid's ticket)\n  - $100 + $12 = $112 (total amount for 7 adult and kid's tickets)\n  = $104 (total amount for all 8 tickets)\nThe total amount for 4 tickets is $104.\nAnswer: $104\n\n### Feedback:\nThe student's response was logical and the choice of words was clearly correct. \n\nThey added the total for adults and children together, so 8 tickets are needed. \n\nThey then used the right equation for division, so $12/2 results in $24, $10/10 results in $24.

{"text": "Answer. 16(+A+B) is the difference in the store's earnings on those two books last week. However, there is a catch here since A and B are negative.\n### Demonstein: First, we need to analyze the statement itself. The best-selling book \"TOP\" was sold at $8 per copy. On the other hand, the least-selling book \"ABC\" was sold above $23 per copy. Thus, we can conclude that \"TOP\" copies are sold more than \"ABC\" copies since it is known that higher numbers of the same type of the product usually mean sales are more.\n\n### Next, we need to determine the number of \"TOP\" and \"ABC\" copies. Out of the total 13, 9 copies are \"TOP,\" and only 4 copies are \"ABC.\"\n\nNext, we determine how many copies are sold of each type. There are 13 sold copies of \"TOP\" books, and only 4 sold copies of \"ABC\" books last week. \nNow, we need to find the \"difference in the bookstore' s earnings\" in order to arrive at the amount the store earned.\n\nNext, we need to look at the earnings of every book to arrive at the average earning of each book according to their numbers. This is because the earnings of the store will be directly proportional to the price of each book. \nThe price of 9 copies of \"TOP books were sold, totaling $72, with $8 per 1. The price of each \"ABC\" book was $19, which means they sold 4 \"ABC\" books, totaling $76.

A clock can be placed on the shelf, so we can mark that choice as right.\nOption B: Bedroom: It's a larger room which may mean that there are more places that it can be stored in. For example \n\n* We hang the clock on the wall  \n* We place it on the bedside table  \n* Put in our drawer\nAnd many more possible locations that it can be placed  \nNow that we know, there are many places to store a clock then we know for sure that the Bedroom is correct.\nOption C: Desk: The desk can hold only some of the clocks.

Thus we can mark that choice incorrect  \nOption D: Wall: Clocks can be placed on the walls only if they are wall clocks that require a hole to be placed on the walls. And that's where they are placed. So if someone doesn't have a wall clock that requires a hole they can't be placed on the walls which can be a disadvantage for the wall.

If we had 7 days a week this weekdays would start at Tuesday 1, 2, 3, Monday 2, 3 4 and weekends Sunday 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.\n\nOne can see that this gives us the right numbers to proceed which becomes:\n\nNumber of weekdays in normal week 5\n\nNumber of weekend days in school weekend. 5\n\nSo, the total number of milk days per number of milk days per Emma for the 5 school days is = 8 days and the 5 weekend days = 10 days.\n\nSum total is 18 days. Which means she buys 18 milk container in a week.\nBut, in the question, it asked about weekly basis. So, she buys 4\u00d73 = 12 containers of milk in a 3 weeks school period.\n\nFinal Answer is 12.", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "He harvests 7 tomatoes from each plant and has 18 plants. He dries half the tomatas and turns a third of them into marnarisauce. He is left with 33% of the original tomatos he started wit. 33% of 18 is 6.4 tomatos if he has all of them\n\n### Instructions:The answer below is an incorrect response to the task. Rewrite the instructional text in such a way that the error is corrected.\n\n### Explanation: The first sentence (Andy harvests) gives us the number of tomatoes that he harvests which is 7 times 18 or 126. However, the second sentence (He harvests 18 plants) contradicts this fact. Either \"18 plants\" refers to plants from which he harvests, or there are 126 tomatoes left. Since no further details about harvesting are mentioned, we know that \"18 plants\" stands for the number of tomatoes. Based on this we also know that the first sentence refers to the number that he harvested and not the number of plants.\n\n### Remark: Please note that we are correcting error.

Who should be contacted? Choices:  O: a person on the road B: a vehicle that veers into oncoming traffic E: a pedestrian that is walking in the road \nRationales: The best approach is to take an opposite process by elimination. First, identify all the options and then the options that are wrong.\n1. An accident could potentially occur anywhere, so all people on the road should be contacted. As the accident would be in the field, a pedestrian should be contacted as they are not the only vehicle around.\n2. A vehicle that veers into the oncoming traffic also needs to be contacted. While this could be a solution for the accident, it's one of the options we need to eliminate.\n3. It's also possible for the car to hit a person walking in the road. This could be a source for the accident as well and needs to be contacted as well. Only after all of the above have been contacted is it possible that the person who veers off the road could be contacted. However, it's not necessary, making this an incorrect choice.\n\n4.

{"text": "The response should not just state that the answer to the question is 12 inches, but the response should make sense and explain the line of thinking that led to that conclusion.

Solve the issue using a single step. If your solution has more than one step, break them down and explain them in detail.\n\n### Rationale:\nInstead of giving a set of instructions without any elaboration, it would be advisable to explain the reasons for solving the problem in the required format. The best way to get started answering the problem is to first understand what type of information we need and what kind of information would be useful to solve the problem.\n\n### Input\n\nIn this case, Angie has a salary of 80 dollars a month and pays a share of the tax in the household. Therefore, she is making 80-42+taxes. (Notice that taxes here is written as a plus sign) She has 18 dollars left.

{"text": "1.First, we want to understand what the question is asking. \n2.It has asked us to find Johnny's discount after the purchase of 1000 balls. The question has also told us we should consider a discount where the prices per item are being sold are $. \n3.Hence, we have got an input where 'X' number of items are sold at $ 1 and 'y' are being sold at $10. \n4.To use a discount in math, we can use it for a ratio. We can make it a simpler expression by subtract 1 from both x and y and substitute this into discount as 1-(r-1) and this comes to x/y*(1-(r-1))*x. Since discounts are applied on an individual basis, we can use ratio again. To make it simple, let's assume x= 90,000 and y=10,000 then.x=.9 and.y=.1\n5.Once we have established discount as.1,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle x-1=.9(1-.9)*.9 \\rightarrow 222(1-.8)1\\]\n\n\\[\\displaystyle 1000x=89994 \\rightarrow 1000*8999=899,994\\]\n6.By using the discount formula and substituting.1 for 'r, we get 900000-1000*1000*(1-0.1)-1000*0.1=899994\n7.After rounding the value to 2 figures, this leads to 900010-833-100-1=899008.10\n8.If we find the rounded value using remainder, say as 899009\n\n### Source of this answer: https://www.the-numbers.com/forum/3/82822#128220", "answer": " 700"}

When looking for a doctor, you could search using various methods. \n2. You could look for doctors based on their location, reputation, experience, and various other factors. \n3. Based on the context of the sentence, the word \"you\" refers to someone who is sick or in need of medical attention so they must find a doctor.\n4. For the word head or face, it could refer to a headache or face infection that may have caused the search for doctors.\n5.

{"text": "Joey needs to study for 2 hours each of the five nights, so he requires 10 hours each week. In addition, he can study for 3 hours a day over the weekend, which is an extra 5 hours per week. This totals 15 hours of study time per week. \n\n### Demontstion: \nRationales: Given the information, you're tasked with calculating how much time Joey will spend studying each week.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. First, let us calculate the number of hours Joey will spend studying per week. There are eight (8) hours in a day and 50 weeks in 6 weeks. This gives us the total number of hours Joey can study per week as [(5 x 8) + (7 x 8)] = 198 hours.\n\n### Input Solution: Joey studies for his S.A.T. for 2 hours per night, 5 nights a weeks. On the weekends, Joey studies 3 hours each day.  If his exam is 6 weeks, how many hours will he spend studying?\n\nRationales: From the instructions:\n1. Joey will spend 2 hours per night every night for 5 nights a each week.\n2. During the weekends, he will spend 3 hours per day for 4 days per week.\n3. The test, which is 6 weeks away is 42 days away.\n4. The total possible number of hours Joey could spend studying is: 2 x 5 + 3 x 4 = 39 hours a week.\n5. This is because it is not possible to complete his study in one week and he has to study for 39 hours a every week, totaling 216 hours of total study time (39 x 5).\n6. Therefore, Joey will spend 39 x 6 = 234 hours total study time.\n\n### Response Solution: Joey studies S.A.T subject for 2 hours per day. 5 times a week. During the weekends Joey studies subject for 3 hours each day for 4 days out of each week. If it is 6 weeks away how many hours will he study?\n\n### Rationales:\n1. We have", "answer": " 96"}

{"text": "To answer this question, we need to calculate the difference in price between a smartphone and a personal computer.\n\nThe smartphone costs $300 and the personal computer costs $500 more. This difference equals $-200.\n\nThen, we need to add 20% of the price of a smartphone to the price of a personal computer to find out what it costs the computer.\n\nFirst, we subtract 20% from the price of the smartphone. This gives us a $60 discount. Then, we add 20% to the price of the personal computer, giving a total discount of 20% plus $60 or $120. The new price is $580.\n\nTo find out the total cost of all three items, we simply add $300 to $580 and, since this sum is $880, we have the answer $880.\n\nWe could have computed this similarly by calculating 80% of the price for the smartphone and then calculating the sum of the smartphone price and 80%-40%=4O%-4O%-20%. This way, we would have the smartphone cost $240 and the computed price for the total of 80% for the smartphone plus 20% for the personal computer would have been $880, which equals the answer we got by applying the simple method.\n\nAnswer: $300 + (580-300)$ = $880$\n\n\\strong{Answer to the questions:} \n\n* 1.

Then we will have left 27 coins. So, the last person would need to share 30 coins, which means they would receive 3 coins. Then, 34 coins are left over, and the first person would get 13 coins. Next would be 31 coins, and then the second guy would get 9 coins. The third guy would get 2 coins, and the fourth would get 6 coins, just to complete the last guy who will get 22 coins. That means that 6 coins are left over. So, we have 8 players in total. The last guy would get 5 coins, and the first guy would get 3 coins. So, every player had 1 coin and got one, which means we had 8 coins. That 8 coins divide by 3 players equal to 2 coins for each person.

To determine the total fruit yield from all fruit yielded, multiply the total number of each type of tree by the total weight of its fruit.\n\nTo determine the total weight of each fruit tree, first add the total mass of each individual fruit produced by the orchard;\n\n3070+2925+65=6870 or 6870 kg\n\nThe total fruit yield for the orchard is 16500 kg.\n\nNext, add all fruit produced by the orchards\n\n16500 +45= 16545 kg\n\nTherefore, the orchard harvested 16544 kg of fruit.", "answer": " 7425"}

Total cost would be 90+(90+195)=$385\n\n    Rationale:In the previous question, Mark said he would visit the theater once a day for 6 weeks. Therefore, in one visit, he would be attending a 3-hour show or 2.5-hour show or 1 show of less than 2.5 hours. As he goes four times and in those times, he spends $5 on every time per hour spent in the theater so he ends up spending $2.5, 5 and 8 dollars respectively.

The final amount of money Mark would spend is calculated by multiplying all 3 numbers by 18 as he will be doing this over a span of 6 weeks.

Choices: \nA: forgetting to screw \nB: forgetting to unscrew \nC: forgetting to unsure \nD: forgetting to screwer \nE: Forgetting to screwer 6: forgetting to scure \nRationales:The question is asking for three common mistakes when using a tool that has nothing to do about a screwdriver per se. Let's see why each choice is incorrect. \n1. Choice (A): Forgetting to screw is completely illogical, since the screw driver is there to help us screw objects, it wouldn't then make sense that we might forget to use it to screw if there's no other help to screw what needs to be screwed. Hence this is not an appropriate answer.\n2. Choice (B) Forgetting to unscrew is the reverse of a screwing action so it doesn't really fit in as an incorrect answer choice.\n3. Choice (C): Forgetting to unsure can be done on a keyboard, and it doesn't sound like a good answer for something associated with carpentry or house installations with screws.\n4. Choices (D), (E): Forgetting to screew or Forgetting to screw aren't possible, since screewing and screwing is two different actions that have nothing in common.

We can do that by adding parentheses around the left side. Since we know that 'N' is a constant, we can distribute it throughout the parentheses and we'll get\n\n( N +  4 ) ( N + 3 ) = 7N2 \n\nThe parentheses aren't necessary at this point, so they can be removed. \n\n### Step-2: Now, use the distributive property to isolate the left side.\n\n(N + 4)( N + 3 )  = 7N2 - N( N + 4 ) - N( N +3)\n\nSimilarly, let's do the same for the right side to get\n\n7N2  = 4N(N + 4) + 3N(N + 3)\n\nNote: Don't divide by '7', that's not what we want for this problem. \n\n## Step 3: Finally, you'll combine the two sides to get \n\n(N +3)( N + 4 ) = N(7(N +3) + 4(N + 4 ) ) \n\nYou can't factor out the parentheses 'N' without the disturbances from having the left side by itself. However, this equation can be simplified into:\n\n(N +4)2 = N((N +6)(N + 3 ) ) \n\nNot exactly what you were hoping to prove, but pretty close.

{"text": "The answer is $344.\nThe way to arrive at the answer is to write out the equation as the sum of 2/3x+1/3x (for x is the number of students surveyed). To find out the total, just multiply the right side of that equation by 60, the number of students. So for x=60, we have 2/3x=2/3x+2/3x-4x = 2/3x-2/3x = 0. 1/3x=1/3x-1/3x-40= 60x=460. And so, x=460/60=7.333333... Now back to the answer again, x+x=14x so x=28.4. But since its just a survey and not really a random sample we'll round it up to 29.

Option A, teenagers, refers to people around the age of 13 (as \"teen\" is a term that refers to ages 13-19) or even younger that still often use bicycles.\n2.

Moreover, the wording of the question does not indicate any reason for only elderly people to prefer the bicycle as the means of transport.\n4. Option B, children, accurately indicates the category of persons that are most likely to use bicycles as the primary means of transportation, as children usually do not have the option to drive a car.

However, an option A: Use telepathy requires you and the friend to both have a superpower of telepathy. \n3. Option B: Ask someone needs a friend who has found the friend to ask his/her friend in which you and the friend are both unable to do.\n4. Options C: Watch for the friends' hands and D: Hug the person would require some form of interaction to locate the friend as both parties must agree on this. \n5. Option E - Touch someone's hair is limited to the presence of any of the person's hair which isn't always guaranteed.\n6. Based on the above options, the correct answer would probably be B: Ask someone.\nAnswer: B) Ask someone.\n\n### Input : Describe why a treehouse is preferred over a cottage.\n\n### Response : Although there are a good and a bad side to treeshouses, there are a number of positive benefits to treeshouses. Let's start with the negative list: it could be hard to access the treehouse and you might even need equipment to get up there. What's more, it generally takes some time and effort to be able to maintain a treehouse properly. You also need to ensure that pests aren't making their home in your treehouse. Finally, treeshouses don't generally have as many facilities as standard cottages and other housing constructions. Now the positive list: first of all, trees are very easy to maintain on their own, so if you don't care much about your house, trees are a great option. Trees also provide you with oxygen which will be beneficial for your well-being. \n\nHowever, you may also lose your sense of privacy if the tree has too many leaves. Also, it can cause a lot of accidents. \n\nAnswer: A treehouse is a", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "Daniel should spend $2,120 and have a total of 346 games in his collection. It is a simple combination because the cost of each dollar must be constant.\n\n### Rationale:To begin, we identify the collection of games into a set and determine the total cost to buy the entire collection.\nA set is the collection of objects that are grouped together as one.\nTo calculate the total cost, we add the cost of each item.\nThe total cost is $1,776 because 40% of the games in the collection equal 25%, meaning Daniel bought 25% at $7 and 75% at $12.\nNext, we determine the total collection. There are 296 games in the set because a collection has an odd number of games in it.\nThen, we calculate the final cost by adding $7 to each game.\nThe games in the final collection all cost $8.\nThe final cost equals 296 times $8 or $2,128.\n\n### Input\n\n#### Instruction:Gabe sold his collection of 41 games. He bought 34% of the games for $3.20 each, 70% of the games for  $5.60 each, and the remaining 70% cost $8.25 to purchase. Find if Gabe broke even after selling the games.\n\n#### Answer: Gabe did not break even after selling the collection.\n\n1. To determine if Gabe broke even, we identify the cost of the games as individual and as a complete set and determine the price of each individual game in the set.The total number of games in the set:41\n\nThe number that is not used on calculations for other purposes\n\n2. We look at the fraction each item costed, and we determine which option is a result of that fraction.\n3. Daniel spent the most on each game.\n4. Daniel spent less on a percentage of the set's items than on any other option. If Daniel had made more purchases in the 34%, he would have spent more than in the previous number.\n5. A percentage is used for the last option. A decimal places were used. \n6. The total number of games was divided by two.\n7. It resulted from multiplying the fraction by", "answer": " 2290"}
{"text": "Input: Grandpa Lou enjoys watching films on the Hallmark channel where each flick lasts ninety minutes. If, on Tues, he saw many full-size movies on the Hall of Fame station for a complete of 4 hrs and 30 mins, and then on Wed, he saw on the same channel twice the amount of motion images he did on Tues, what is the greatest quantity of full-size films Grandpa might have watched in the course of these two days?\nOutput: Maximum amount of movies: 16\nRationales: Firstly, the question starts with the following phrase, \"If, on Tues,...\" which indicates that \"on Tuesday\" has some significance in the question, and it should be taken into account before attempting to answer the question.\n2. Secondly, we can observe that \"he watched several full-length films on the Hallmark Channel for a total of 5 hours and 30 m minutes\" which means that the total times he saw full-length movies and the total time he spent watching movies on that channel is 5hr and 30m.\n3. Next, we can deduce that, on Wednesday, he spent 2 x times Tuesday, that is 10 times as much.\n4. Hence, he spent 2x the total time on Wednesday which is 8hr and 30 m.\n5. Finally, given that \"each films lasts 90 mins\" this means that the maximum number of films he saw on Tues and on Wed is 90 mins each, 16 movies.\nSince, \"Hallmark Channel is where every film lasts 90 min\", it is guaranteed that the maximum number of movies he has watched is 16.", "answer": " 9"}

This is because on Wednesday he spent $10, which is twice as much as the reference point, and on Saturday, he spent $25.\n### Rationales:\n1. To identify the total cost, we can analyze each day and its respective cost to know the amount he spends on each day.\n2. The first choice is the Monday and its cost is $5, the cost of a ticket on a Monday.\n3. The next choice is Wednesday and its cost ($10) is 2 times more than the Monday's choice, thus representing double the amount of cost.\n4. The next choice is Saturday's cost ($25), which is 5 times more than the Monday choice's cost, and 2 times more than Wednesday's choice.\n5.

To begin with, we can calculate the individual total amount of money spent on shopping by Lisa and Carly.\n2. Firstly, according to the question, Lisa spent $40 on t shirts. Based on the information, we can identify that Lisa spent $40/2=$20 on jeans, according to the second rule we know that Lisa spent $4*$2=$8 on coats.\n3. Similarly, Carly spent $40 on $30 on t-shirt.\n4. According to the third rule, Carly spend $40/4=10 on jeans.\n\n5. To find the total amount of money spent by the two, we sum the amount spent by each of Lisa and Carly. This gives us $20+$8+$10=$48. Therefore, Lisa spent $48 and Carly spend $48.\n\n6.

{"text": "Tom used 10 plates each weigh 30 pounds on exercise machine. The machine uses technology increasing the weights 20%. To determine the weights felt on lowering portion, we need to identify how much each added weight was. The machine adds 30 pounds to 10 = 40; 30% of 40 is 12; 12 pounds were added to each weight, making each plate weigh 42 pounds for the lower portion. The weights felt 42 pounds \n\nAnswer:42 pounds\n\n### Input. What is the distance (in feet) between the start point and the first intersection?\n\n### Demystification: We're given a grid and a point.  We could place the distance between the start point and first intersection on another coordinate plane to solve.  We'd need two more coordinates for the start point and the point of intersection.  We could do this using triangular coordinates or the Cartesian coordinate plane.  I chose to use the more intuitive Cartesian coordinate plane method since that's how I learned to do these in high school.\n\n### Solution: Since we know the dimensions of the grid, (8*8), we could determine that each section is 1 unit wide or 1 unit length.  We already know the start point is at (1,1) since that's where the problem directs us too. The point of intersection is (-1,-1) which we have to determine too.  We could do that with a little bit of logic. (x,y) represents the (x coordinate,y coordinate) of the point the letter at the end of that coordinate represents. So, the point for (-1,-1) is (-1, -1).  To get the coordinates of (-1,-1) from the coordinate grid of our solution, we must subtract the start point which is (1,1) from the intersection point, we will see this subtraction done a lot in solving coordinate grids.  The first subtraction will be (1,1) - (1,1) to get (0,0).  The (0,0) coordinate is above the first section so we're looking over the top of the box.  Now we subtract 0,0 from each coordinate and we get (-9, -9). We will look at how (-9, -9)", "answer": " 360"}

We can begin by noting that Section G has 10 rows. In every row there are 11 cars, making it a total of 110 cars across the section.\n\n\n### Input and Demm: We can then count the number of minutes it would take to walk past every car in the Section G.

Traveled from Birmingham to London in what time? Choices: 1: 57 hours 2:30 minutes 5:30 hours\nRationales: There are two factors needed to calculate the time in the above equation.\n1. First, we have the speed of the car per hour, which is 5.\n2. We also need the total distance to cover from the starting to the end point.\n3. Hence, the total time it will take for the car to travel from one point to another = (total distance / speed of the car)\n4. Calculating the total distance of the route is very simple, given the route from Birmingham to London. According to Google Maps, it takes between 4 and 5 hours\u2019 drive from Birmingham to London at 40 miles per hour. The total distance from Birmingham to London = 300 miles.\n5. For the first option (A:57 hours), we just substitute the 300 miles into the formula and get 57 hours. This time is wrong because the car is moving in London and should be zero.\n6. Similarly, for option (2: 30 minutes), the formula changes to ( 300 miles / 5 miles per hour ) which gives 60 minutes for travel, which is also incorrect.\n7. Option (3:5:30 hours) is the correct answer. It states that it takes around 5 hours to cover the distance, which is correct because it takes roughly 4 to 5 hours of traveling to reach London.\n8. This is because of the speed of the car which is 5 miles per hour + the travel time spent on the route", "answer": " 220"}

The response is \"How would you describe being in jail...\", which means \"surprised\", being the only negative emotion. Thus, the two choices were B and D (terrible and terrified) to eliminate.

{"text": "80 dollars\n\nDetailed Explanation:  \n```\nFirst, we break down the problem statement into manageable pieces:\n\nFred had 2**36** dollars to spend on **[6]** books. After buying **[6]** them, he had **[14]** dollars.\n\n**NOTES:**\n\n* 01. **\"How much did each book cost?\"** = How many dollars did each book cost? Or Average of price paid for each book.\n* 02. **\"On average\" refers to each individual book, not the whole amount bought.**\n\nSince Fred bought 6 books, let them be represented by a subscripted number, (i) or a superscripted number, (i).\n\nWe can now rewrite the question into this equation:\nAverage of price paid for 6 books, x = Total spent on 6 books / 6  \nSo, we'll have our initial question broken into its individual components:\n\nTotal spent on 6 books = 236 (subscript i)\nAverage price paid for each book = 14 (original question)\n\nUsing the equation, we rewrite our original question into this:\nTotal spent on 14 / 6\n\nSo, we get 15.6667 dollars as our answer for average price paid for each book, or 80 dollars as our final answer\n\nNote: Using integer division in Excel, the answer would be 80.00\n```", "answer": " 37"}

After he ran out of gas and went back home for farming tools and to go back to the farm, he drove to the farm which is 6miles away since his truck had 0 gallons and gas 1 gallon, 1 miles drove back home to get farming tools, so 2 miles each mile gas was 1 gallon. So 5 miles drove supermarket 2 miles came back home for 2 miles went to farm and 2 miles came back for 6 miles x 2 gallons drove to supermarket each mile was 2 gallons x 5 miles was 10 gallons so now he had 10 - 2 gallons 8 gallons so 8 miles drove 2 miles to the farm and 6 miles drove to farming tools so now each gallons is 10 mile each so he drove 60 miles x 10 miles each so now each gallon is 6 miles so we have 60 miles x 2 gallon was used each miles so 30 miles so 30 x 2 = 60 miles to the supermarket 10 miles each to farm 16 miles each used 1 gallons the other half of gas was 1 gallons and he had to go to supermarket 16 miles each to farm and back to supermarket each = 16. So he drove 30 miles, each he use 2 gallons and then the farming equipment was used.

Choices: \nA: no B: yes C: in the case that there are no books\nD: only the books that can't fit\nRationales:\n1. The choices suggest options for where you could store other books if you want to put a book on a shelf. \n2. There are two options which can function as the best answers, so we can look at each one in detail to make that decision. \n3. The first answer suggests that you don't need to store the other  the other books first before adding a new one to the book shelf. \n4. This might be the best answer if it's a situation where you only have enough space for a single book on the rack at a time. \n5.

Although water is where a flipper can live, a flipper, by definition, is an aquatic mammal, i.e., it lives in water. So, option A: water is the correct choice.\nThe second option D: river is incorrect too. Rivers aren't living places for flip-flops, and they have a solid surface, not an empty bed of water where flippers can lie on their backs with their feet down.\n\nThird option E: ground with water is wrong because the ground itself is not a living place for a flipper.\n\nHence the most appropriate choice B: ground.\n\n### Answer:\nAns: B: ground\n\n### Rationales:\n1.

{"text": "Daniela spends $180.\n\n#### Explain:\n\nThe percent discount for shoes is 40%, meaning that each pair would be $50 x (100%-40%) = 100% - 40% = 60% off, bringing their price to (50 x 60%)/100% = $30. Now, the dress would be 20% off, so we apply that to the retail price of $100, making it $100 x (10% + 20%) x 100 = $100 x 30% = $32 off, making the total for the dress $100 - 32 = $68. Now, Daniela would pay $50 for each pair of shoes and $30 for each dress, for a total of $150. The discount is applied to the original total, not the price each item is on sale for. This means that if the next round of sales was 20% off shoes and 10% off dresses, she would still pay $150.\n\n\n#### Answer Explanation:\n\nThe percent given off from a purchase is calculated by subtracting the original price from the reduced price, then multiplying that by 100 to get the percent (or the percentage of the price we are using).\n\n#### Answer Rationale:\nIn the beginning of the instruction, it states that a store is having a 40% discount on shoes and 0 to 10% off on dresses. To figure out the total amount she spent for two pairs of shoes originally $50 and one $100 dress on sale at 20% discount, we need to multiply the initial price of 2 pairs of shoelaces by the discount % (40%), which is 50 X 40% = $20. Similarly, multiply the discount amount of 20% of $100 dresses by the price, 100 X 20% = $2. As the total discount is 50 X $20 + 100 X $2 = $120.\n\n### Demo Response\n\nIn this response, 180", "answer": " 140"}

{"text": "#### Solution:\nTo determine how many hours, we first count the number of jumps.  3 times a second = 3 times per second.  \n1 sec x 54,090 = 172,040 jumps. Multiply by the number of seconds in each hour (3600 seconds).  That yields 630,240.  Divide by 3600(hours/24). That yields 1793. So he would need to jump for 1793 hours, 11 minutes.\n\n### Solution:\n```\ninput:Mark wants to set record for most consecutive rope jumped. The record is 50k, he can jump 3 times per second, how many hours will it take.\n```\nFirst you need 1793 in hours. There are 60*60*24 432000 seconds in a day and he can jump in 3 seconds so total number of jumps 1720000 that equals 1720400. Then divide it 3600 480000 is remaining so multiplying 3600*1393 =362712 then divide by 4800 you got 7742 remaining hours.\n\nAnswer:\n\n```text\nSolution:\nTo determine how long it'll take Mark to get to 30,000, you need to multiply 3 seconds x 30,090 jumps.

Given that Bryan works eight hours and spends 32/4= 8 hours on marketing posts and 8/2= 4 hours on advertisement posts, we can reasonably conclude that Bryan will spent 32 hours on these marketing posts and 4 hours on these advertisement posts.\n2. Therefore, Bryan's daily time spent on marketing posts will be equal to 32/8= 4 hours.\nRationales:\n\n### Input\n\nBryan works as the social media account manager.He does marketing posts,advertisement posts,and customer outreach posts on behalf of his client.His client has him spend four hour on the customer outreach posts,half of that time on advertisements posts, each day.Bryan is on the job for eight hours.How much time (in hours) in which Bryan spends on the marketing posts.\nInput:Bryan works for eight hours and spends four hours on the customer outreaching posts and four hours on advertising posts each day.\nRationales Input:\n\n### Demostration:\n\n1.

{"text": "The first step is to set up an equation that relates the total number of students from elementary and middle school.  To do so, we need to know the number of students in each school.\n* Let's say there are n students in Elementary  School.\n* Let' s say there are m students in Middle  School.\n* Then, four times the number of elementary school students = six times the number of middle school students.\n      Let's call the sum of Elementary  and Middle  School combined t = x + y in which x is number of elementary students and y is number of middle school students\n  The question asks, if the number of middle school  (m) students is 50, for what is t? \n          Now, three less than 4 times the number of middle  school  (m)  students  is equal to 6  times the number of elementary  school  (n) students.\n            From the equation, we know that t = (4 x m - 3) + n.\nFor our solution, we want m be 50.\n     Simplifying the above equation, we have, t = 50 + n.\n\nThe next step is to simplify the equation by getting the value of n on the right side so that the equation becomes  x + n = t.\n\n      We rewrite the equation for t to t = x+n and substitute the value of n to get x = 4xm - 60 \n              Finally, to solve the above equation, we subtract 4xm from both sides and divide both sides by 6.\n              This gives us x = (m - 4 x)/6.\n\n\n#### Solution\n* Elementary school contains 4 x ((m - 4 x) / 6) students.\n* Middle school contains m - (4 x ((m -4x) / 6)) students.\n* T = (m - 50)/6 \n\n#### Source: \n\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following Grade Math question.\n\n\n### Demostration:\nThe question below is very similar to the Grade Math word problem in the \"Demonstration\" section.

This energy is usually supplied through food, and a healthy diet and regular exercise are essential for muscle development.\n\n1. The four main functions of muscles are movement, balance, posture, and heat production. Muscle contractions are used to produce force, while contracting muscles also generate heat. Muscles are also used to maintain balance and posture as well as help regulate body temperature.\n\nMuscles in the legs generate the push in walking, whereas the arms and shoulders are responsible for lifting and carrying. The abs and stomach are used to twist and bend the body, allowing for agility. The neck and chest muscles help to stabilize the head and chest, whereas neck and head muscles are used for neck and head motion. Movements including walking, lifting, turning, and running are all powered by the muscles. They are also essential for proper body posture and balance. These four tasks are performed by the muscles in the body.\n\nMuscles play a key role in keeping heat away from the skin by regulating body temperature. The body's central core heats up when metabolism occurs, and sweating cools the body down by evaporating perspiration onto the skin surface. When the skin temperature begins to drop as a result of heat loss, sweating helps to regulate body temperature. The heart, which is located close to the center of the body and has a high metabolism, generates heat as well. When the sun or external heat source stimulates sweat glands, they produce more sweat, assisting in cooling the body. Muscles serve as regulators of body temperature.\n\n### Answer:\n\nMuscles:  1.

The first cost is $3 because it is the cost of the red horseshoe magnet.\n3. The cost of the sticker is $0.25 because it is half the price of the red horseshoes magnet $3\n4. The cost of two stuffed animal is $21. \n5. The cost of the four items was $6.55.\n6. Therefore the cost of two stuff is 21\n7. The cost of the three times more expensive red horseshoe magnet is 3*3=9\n8. We have found that the price of two stuffed animals is 21 and three times more expensive magnets are nine 9=12, and the remaining money was 6.55 \n9.

Choices: A: spending time reading B: using your phone C: being lazy D: sitting in your home E: sleeping\nRationales:\n1. To decide whether to spend some time with others or do some work, we need to examine each option and their respective qualities.\n2. The first choice. A: spending time on reading is a possibility, but the person needs to be careful not to misuse their phone or spend extra time on it.\n3. The Second choice, B. Using your phone is convenient, and you can do it anywhere, including at home or in the office.\n4. The Third choice, C. Being lazy can be a way to stay at home. Laziness may result in wasting time on a device or simply sitting inside the home.\n5. The Fourth Choice, D.

{"text": "Jack can still return 1 Best Buy card and 10 Walmart gift cards since the total cost of those is 584 dollars.\n\n### Supporting Evidence\nThis is a tricky question to answer, but the answer is pretty straightforward once you factor in what we know about the scammer, the gift cards, and the phone call. When they call initially, the scammer indicates that the amount of gift cards needed to be returned equals the total of all the gift cards the scammer needs. The response the scammer gives then is that if the person doesn't send in all the cards, then the IRS will arrest the person. We're told that Jack only sends in 3 gift cards at first and that this is enough to convince the scammer to provide codes for 3 more. We can assume that the scammer provided all the codes for all the gift cards they required, since they would be a lot of different codes to remember. However, since the scammer only wants codes for gift cards that cost 500 dollars or more, that means that Jack can only send cards back that are less than 500 dollars. This means that Jack can only return 1 Best Buys card and 10 walmart cards, both valued at a bit less than $500 each.\n\n\n### Feedback about this task:\nMy friend helped me with this task, and he also taught me some tricks that enabled me to complete this task even faster.

When Jack is bitten by a mosquito, there is a 40% chance that the mosquito is carrying malaria. When the mosquito bites Jack, there is a 50% chance that the person is either infected or not infected, after which there is a 56% chance that the person does not get infected but is instead infected.\n\n$$P(\\frac{malaria \\text { infected mosquito}}{40\\%}) = 0.40 \\% \u00d7 0.56 \\% = 0.0224\\%$$\n\n$$P(\\text { got infected } / \\text { got biten }) = 0.56\\% \\times 0.50\\% = 0.28\\%$$\n\nHence, the initial percent chance of getting one of the two infections is $\\frac{0.0226\\% + 0.28 \\%}{2} = 2.29\\%$\n\n### Further Reading", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "Input:A parking garages near Nora's are 4 stories tall. At each level, there are 100 spaces. Also, there are 58 spaces available on the first level. And the second and third levels have 2 more available parking spots than the first level, and the fourth level has 5 more spaces than the third level.\n\nRationale:\n1. We know that on level 1. There are 54 spaces available.\n\n2. We can use the method of addition or subtraction to solve this problem, as we must identify the number of full parking spots available in the entire garage.\n\n3. We know that on the first level, there are 54 spaces; on the second level, there are 39 spaces available; on the third level, there are 27 spaces available; and on the fourth level, there are 8 spaces available.\n\n4. According to these information, we will begin our calculation by counting the number of available parking spots on each floor. Therefore, on the first floor, there are 55 available parking spots, on the second floor, there are 40 available spots, on the third floor, there are 22 available parking spots. And on the fourth level, we take 15 parking spots because that one is the only available on the floor.\n\n5. Now that we know the number of available parks on each floor, we can start summing the result. It would help if I had to add 55+40+22+15 = 132, which is the total spaces available.\n\n6. Once we determine the sum of the spaces available on each floor, we need to subtract the spots available on the floor with the next highest level, and thus, we would have more spots available. In this situation, the next level has the least amount of available spots, and thus, it will be subtracted.\n\n7. It is necessary to subtract 58 from the total number of available spots, which is 132. Therefore, the total amount of available spots would be 132-58 = 74, the sum of all the total available spots.\n\nHence, the answer is 74.\n\n### Output:\n7", "answer": " 186"}
{"text": "After Belinda throws the ball, the border collie will take 3.25 seconds to catch up with the ball.\n\n### Rationale: First analyze all the numbers in the statement.\n1. Belinda throws the ball at 20 feet/sec. This information can be extracted from the first part of the problem: If the ball flies. Now we can solve for the time it took for the ball to fly.\n2. One can use trigonometry to  solve for this:\nTime = tan^-1 (20 ft / 60 ft)\n= tan^-1 (0.33 ft / sq ft)\n= 0.5417 seconds\n3. However, this is the time taken for the ball to fly, and not the time taken for it to fall. So, to solve for the time taken for the falling ball to reach the ground, one should subtract the time needed for it to fly, which was 0.54 seconds.\n4. Subtracting 0.54 sec by 8 sec. gives 0.33 sec. This is the time for the ball to fall.\n5. Now we can plug the value for the falling time of 0.33 second in our original equation.\nTime = tan^- 1 (20 ft./sec) - tan^-1(20 ft./sec * 0.33sec)\n=( 0.54sec)- 0.50 sec * 0.63 = 3.25 sec.\n\nTherefore, the border collie would take approximately 3.25-seconds to catch up to the thrown ball.\n\n## What is incorrect about this solution?\n1. The unit of time is inconsistent between the second line which is 8 seconds and the third line which is.53 second.\n2. The units of time should all be consistent. When doing math, units should be switched to match the unit type of the next line. For example, convert seconds -> m x h (or sec -> m x m x s (because the speed used (20) is in meters.\n3.

A television set uses 0.00049 kWh in one hour, which is 49 mAh in one minute. 6 to 11 years old children use an average of 600 watts while watching TV so 0.6 watts equals to 600 w mAh if the time is one (1) minute. So then, that will be 600 w X 20 m Ah = 12000 ma X 49 m Ah = 584175 mAh each week. 58418000, or 5.8418 million mAh in each weeks.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe question states that a kid (6-11 years old) spends 45 minutes each a day watching TV in which we can calculate that in a week they spend a total of 45 min X 16 days = 760 minutes per week or 760 min X 60 min = 45600 min per week. The unit for energy that we can use is mA (milliamperes) = 10^-3 or \u00b9\u2044\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080 A, based on their average power of 600 W or 0.6 W and one hour = 3600 s, meaning that 0.0036 A is the hour.

{"text": "Santino has (65, 35) fruits in total.\n\n### Rationale: To answer this math question, we need to find the number of papayas and mangoes that Santino has, and then multiply them to get the total number of fruits.\n\nFirst, we count the number of trees, which gives us 2 trees for papaya and 3 trees for mangoes.\n\nSecond, we note that each papaya tree produces ten fruits. To count how many fruits each papaya tree has, we divide 10 by the number of papaya trees, 2. This gives us 5 papayas for each papaya tree.\n\nThen we note that each mango tree produces twenty fruits. To count this number of fruits, we divide 20 by the number of mango trees, 3. This gives us 6.66 fruits for each mango tree.\n\nMultiplying the number of trees (3 for the mangoes and 2 for the papayas) with the number of fruits produced by each tree gives us 20 papayas and 66 mangos in total.\n\nSummarizing the calculations gives us that the total number of frukts Santino has is (10 x 2) + (20 x 3) = (20,30) (65, 40) = (65, 20) fruits. Therefore, Santino has (6) 65 fruits and (3) 40 mangos in total.", "answer": " 80"}

According to a [blog post](https://blog.toadlily.com/post/2017/08/22/Are-toads-toxic-to-a-venus-flytrap) by [a former owner of Toad Lily Toadlets](https://blog.google/around-the-world/ecolandmarks/) (the company that sells Venus flytraps), these plants may be harmed by toads, but it's because they may be eating the toads. A Venus flytrap only catches insects in its mouth. 2. Ferns don't like to be in low light, and they don't like having their leaves covered in moss or mold, so they likely wouldn't be kept with any kind of moss. 3. Pineapples are only tropical, so they would probably die in a space with toads. 4. Mint doesn't grow large enough to really be considered a \"plant\". 5.

Paul runs for 2 x 12 or 24 minutes, leaving the rest of time for movies. Since the time for movies is 4.5 hours, then there are 2.5 hours left, which divided by 1 hr gives 2.5, and so this is how much time remains for movies. Then, in his 2.5 left for movies, his 4 movies watched, in movies, we multiply it by 12 for minutes each, 12 x 4 miles then gives 24 miles.

If Gerard's bags have, on the average, 30 apples, how many apples do Pam\u2019s truck have, on the average?\n\n### Demostration:\nFirst, we'll look at each question separately and eliminate options that don't help us and consider the following details:\n1. The total number of apples for Pam\n2. The number of apples for Gerald\n3. And the relationship of the apples, for example, How much are apples of Gerald equal? How much more are an apple of Pam? Etc\n\n### Response 2:\nIt looks like Pam has:\n- 120 apples (3*10 + 3*30)\n\nGerald has:\n- 45 apples (15 - 120*3)\n\nNow, we can look for the average number of apples. In this case, for the first question, we know:\n1. The number of bags\n2. The number for each bag (G or P)\n3. The total number of bags\n\nFrom the numbers that we have, we can see:\n- if Gerald has 45 apples in bags that contain an average of 30 apples each, then each bag has 15/30 or 0.5 apples\n- so the number of bags is 45/30 = 1.5\n\nSimilarly - and the formula and logic is the same - to calculate the number of bags for the second question (2nd question is an equation of the first one):\n\n1. The number bags: 15 bags\n2. Number of apples per bag: 50 apples/15 bags = 3.3333 apples per bag\n\n3. The total of: 3.33 apples per bags.\n\nThe solution:\n\n1.

A: a number of time 3. A: a number that can't add zero to itself 4. A: can't add it to negative number 5. A: will always leave one digit \nRationales:\n1. Although the answer is correct and does not conflict with the question, 615 is not a time in hours. So, the correct answer is actually 2: 615 is a number of time.\n2. One reason I can argue that the answer is 2 is because we cannot make 615 as a multiple of two, thus not a multiple of zero. And although we can say that 615 can add any number because of the unique property of being 615, this doesn't affect the properties of it being time since it is not a number that is divisible by zero. However, 615 cannot divide into zero because it is less than one. (615/0 is less than one). We can see this through this property because a number is divisible by zero if and only if it is a number of zero times. But a number can only be of zero times if it can be one ( 0 = 0 x 1 = 1).\n3. Similarly, 615 can't be a number that will add zero to it because if 615 is 615 + 0, 615/0 will be less than one.\n4. Similarly, 621 cannot be what it turns into because if we have 615 = 610 + 5, then the difference between each number would be less than one. (56.15 - 61 = 4.9), which isn", "answer": " 28"}
{"text": "48 biscuits\n\n### Demostration:\nTo find out how many biscuits can be made, we should convert 12 to the units we need in order to calculate the answer.

However, if there is a hole in the pool with a lower rate leaking water, the time required to fill the pool would be increased.  Since the hole has a lower rate of draining water, it should be filled for the same time as the rate provided by the garden hose which is 40 minutes.  \n3. Hence, total time for filling the pool with a hole will require 40 minutes and we'll consider this for all our calculations.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. The garden hose provides water at the rate 1.6 gallions*1.6 Gallons Gallons/minute = 2.56 Gallons per minute, then since the pool only holds 6 gallons it should be filled for 6 minutes.\n2. This time required will only be for the time when the pool is full or to be filled completely. \n3.

Let's first focus on cucumbers since the question explicitly mentions how many fewer cucumbers there are in total. We can rewrite the cucumber count with a subtraction:\n\n100(X-130). The key thing we have is the number of cucumbers, which has the same denominator as the numerator. Thus we can divide both sides by 100, with subtraction.\n\nX-130/100=100/(X-130)*100\n\nX=(100+130)/10\n\nX=109\n\nNow we know that every two peppers equals a cucumber.

Option B: This is the light purple color, we can refer to the Merriam-Webster dictionary for analysis.

{"text": "Apple sold 100000$ worth of products that day.\n\n### Review:\n1. Identify the choices:\n2. Analyze the question: A company offers an incentive for its employees based on their productivity. Employees whose workload is 80% or higher of the required daily hours for their position are awarded an extra $500 for every month they meet the minimum. What is the percentage of an employee's annual salary increase if he or she is awarded the incentive for 3 consecutive months and his or her workload stays at 75% for the entire year?\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the question by providing the calculated ratio. \n\n### Dem. Res:\n1. What do we need to know to make the calculation? First, we need to know the salary of the employee and the number of months the performance bonus is given. \n2. From the question, we can surmise that the salary can be obtained because an annual salary amount is already provided. Hence, the employee's total yearly salary is $50000.\n3. To find out the number of months for which the performance bonus is awarded, we need to note the monthly increase in the performance bonus. An employee's bonus for 3 consecutive months is calculated by multiplying the monthly bonus by the number of consecutive months awarded. Therefore, the annual bonus for the performance incentive is a $5000.\n4. Since the employee's salary doesn't change, we can find the bonus percentage by dividing it by the employee's sala:\n\n```\nBonus = Annual bonus/ Total salary\n```\n\n5. Substituting the values from the question:\n\n```\nTotal salary = $5000 + $5000 = $10000\nBonus = $500/ $1000\nB = 0.05\n\n500 / 1000 = 0.5\n```\n\n6. The bonus percentage for this employee is then 0.5.\n7. Hence, the answer to the problem is $500/1000 =0.5 \nAnswer: (500/1,00", "answer": " 670"}

{"text": "132.\n\nThe question is asking us to solve for '3', which is given that we earn $132 per 3 days. The first thing we do is to solve the equation (4\u00d75)+3=132 by creating a second equation and isolating x, which is the length of the portrait. The x = equation would read, $$5+x=132$$ which will then allow us to solve for x $5+x = 132 \u2192 x = 132-5 = 127$ We isolate this portion of the equation by subtracting 5 from both sides of the inequality, then square both sides, as well as isolate the remaining equation. $$x^2=127+5 \\to (x+5)(2x-1) = 132$$\nSquare both sides of the equation and set it equal to zero, as shown below. $$(x+5)(x-2) = 0 \\to x(x-2) =0$$ After isolating this section from the original equation above, we can then solve for x to see what the lengths of the portrait are. $$ x= 2 \\to x= 1, or x= 3 \u2192 $$ Therefore, x = 2 and so the portraits are 2 by 2 and 3 by 3.

Then, to fix his car he spent $400 which means he had to spend $450 from the piggy bank totaling $550. Hence, there are $15 dollars left in the piggy bank.\n\n### Rationale: If the question reads: \"How many dollars...\"\n\nWhen there is no context in the question itself on what the \"How many dollars...\" is referring to, it will have three primary choices: \n\n1. First interpretation: It is the answer to a specific amount or value of \"dollars\" (e.g. 52, 672, etc.).\n2. Second interpretation: This is in reference to the actual amount of dollars in a piggy bank, savings account, or any other container that holds money.\n3. Third interpretation: This is about something having a dollar value (e.g. a pair of shoes that cost $25).\n\nIf it seems evident that the first or second interpretation refers to how many dollars in an amount, it should be used as the intended interpretation. \n\n### Rationales: \"Put\" and \"Spend\"\n\nThese keywords refer to saving, buying, borrowing, lending, and transferring money, among other actions.\n\n### Inputs (1-3 are combined): John saves $25 month for two years and then he spent $40 on his sister's cake and $220 on a used car.

{"text": "The boy buys 6 cards per box, which gives him a total of 12 cards for a total cost of $20.25.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n### Reason 1\nBecause the first box contains cards that costs $1.25 and the second box contains cards that costs 1.75, if they buy 6 cards from each, they will buy one card from each box. $3.5(1.25) = $4.5(1.75), and the total cost will then be $20.2(5), because of rounding.\n\n### Reasons 2 and 3\nThis is the reason for the last answer because the answer is $20.2. $14 = 12, which equals to $20.2\n\n### Reassurance\nYou added the prices and divided by 2 to get the total. This is one way to do it.\n\nYou subtracted the first price from what is in the second price, then divide the second price by the first price.

{"text": "First, let's summarize the information provided in the question. The total number of acres is 3  + 9  + 12 = 24 acres. We are given the percentage of water used for each type of crop. Each acre of corn will require 20 gallons, each acre of cotton will require 80 gallons, and each acre of beans will require two times the amount of water as required by an acre of corn.\nGiven the inputs, the goal is to answer the final question: What percentage of the total water will go to Farmer Beb's farm?\nThe total water for each crop will be the total number of acres of each crop multiplied by the water used by the crop. Because Farmer Bob grows 2 more acres of beans than Farmer Bernie, her crop will require less water. The amount of water used by Farmer Bob for growing beans is (2\\ 4) * 2 = 1\\ 2.\\\n\n### Solution:\nCorn acres = 3 * 20 = 60 gallons\\ Farmer Bob grows 4 more acres of corn than Farmer Brenda, so the amount of water required for corn is more for Farmer Bob. Corn acres = 6 * 20 =120 gallons\nCotton acres = 9 * 80\nBeans acres = 12 *2 = 24", "answer": " 36"}

(Input: grade- a grade, Input: GPA- cumulative grade point average, Grade- F)\n\n### Demostration:\nHere's how we would handle this scenario below.\n\n1. The student takes calculus class with GPA set to: 4.0\n2. The student would get an F grade as in Input: Grade- F. \n3. If the student gets a F in calculus the grade would be a F which means that student's GPA would be something below 4.0.\n\n### Sample Solution:\nThe student would have to fail their calculus class which would result in a F on their grade. As a result, the student's GPA should have been below 4.0 if their calculus grades were recorded in the GPA.\n\n### Explaination:\nSo, to calculate the student's GPR would be calculated as the sum of all final grades plus 1 for each credit hour.\n\nThe  total of the above points equals to 3.58 which is then 3.5 as a decimal which is close to 3.5 if we add a.1 for each credit hour, the resulting total would be 4.063, a 3.\n\n### Rationales:\nIn this case, 4.0 is the total sum of points that you get from all your classes, and 3.58 is the total sum of all of the grades minus the value of your lowest grade times 1", "answer": " 7"}

How much gas is in the gas tank?\n\n### Demand: Rationales:\n\nFirst of all, the grammar \"When I get this car\" can be interpreted as \"By the time I get this\" or \"When I bring this home\".\n\n1. There will be an implied question mark.\n2. This way, the first thing to do is to understand what \"this\" refers to. In this case, since the sentence mentions \"a car\", the next phrase \"When I get this\" refers to \"when I get this car\".\n3. Then the next question we should answer is what does \"this car\" refer to.\n4. We know that \"this car\", at the start of the sentence, refers to \"whatever car the writer has\" (this writer has a car).\n5. Thus, it can't mean \"what did you get for your birthday\" because the writer doesn't know how much gas they have in their tank as they still need to go to the gas station. As mentioned, by the question mark, the second part suggests a question and not a statement.\n6. Moreover, the fact that there is gas in the gas tank may refer to \"their car tank\" or \"their gas tank\" even though it is followed by \"I'll fill it at\".\n7. However, since it is the reader's car tank, it refers to \"their car\". Since \"their\" refers to \"the writer's", "answer": " 14"}

John is paying $900 per month, so he is receiving 2/3 of the money, or $2/3 of the payment. The profit is $204.33 per month, which is $2043.32 per year.\n\n### Input::The amount being put aside each month is $[.125x100]/12$, what does the monthly balance of the account become in three years?\n\n### Answer:\n\n$1250.53\n\n### Expo\n\nThe first step is to convert the amount put aside each day to a dollar amount, using a monthly compounding, so using $25. For the first year, the total amount put aside would be $[25x365]/12$ = $916.67. For the second year, multiply by the factor of $1.03. For the third year, multiply by the formula of $1.011.5$.\n\nThe answer in total is $[1250.053] = 1250. This equals a total of $[1250-916.667] = 333.35 dollars.\n\n## License\n\n### Copyright\nCopyright (C) 2011-2015 Kyle Kemper, MIT License, http://www.kylekemper.com.\n\n### MIT License\n\nKyle Kemper uses the MIT license for his software.

The dogowner gave 9 bones to the dog, so the dog ate a total of 180lb which are 27 bones. Then we need to eliminate the total weight that the dog eats in a day, so 160-420= (160).

{"text": "2.607 kilograms\n\n### Rationale:We can solve this using basic math logic.So here are the details that we need to make use of to answer the question correctly:\n\nThe question provides information about Rose, who had 10 kilos of rice. First and foremost, we must ensure that this weight is expressed in kilograms.\n\nThen, a total of 9/10 of that amount is cooked in the morning. This implies that we have 9 kilograms to work with before cooking or otherwise, if 2/10 of the remaining is cooked in the evening. \n\nHence 1/4 of 9 kilograms remaining = 2.6075 kilograms\n\nWe must then express the answer using grams, not kilograms, in order to solve the problem accurately:\n\nThe weight of 1 gram is one thousandth of a kilogram. 10 kilogrames can be written as 10000 grams. The 1/4 left is 2133.3 grams\n\nAfter the fractional portion remaining, there is still 78.7 kilograms or 78,700 grams to work with. Since 2.6 kilograms is 2,600 grams, we can subtract that from the remaining amount to find the answer to be 76,100 grams or 76,1 kilograms of rice left.\n\nAnswer:2.6061 gram\n\n### InputRose had 12 eggs.

After dividing them evenly with her seven friends, she gave eight pens and 2 pencils to each friend.\n2. She kept the remainder as her own.\n3. We can see now that we have three groups of data: Before giving the pens to her friends, Catherine had 64 (60 pens + 6 pencils), after giving them out, she had 2 (4 pens + 2 pencils), and she had 1 pencil after she kept the remaining pens. \n\n### We will be forming two equations:\n1. First, to find the number of pens Catherine had,\n2. 2nd to find the number of pencils Catherine had.\n3. Let's write the first 2 equations:\na: Catherine had 58 pens before giving it to her friends.\nb: Catherine had 2 pens after giving it to her friends because she kept the remaining 6 pencils\n\n### The first step is to multiply \"58 pens\" and \"6 pencils\" to find out how many pens Catherine had after giving it to her seven friends.\n4. Now we need to figure out the resting value to each of our equations. The equation to find the remaining pens should be modified to have the number of pens Catherine gave all her friends combined. \n5. Because Catherine has 6 pens she can give out to her friends.\n\n### Thus, Catherine gave out 34 (8 pens + 2 pens + 6 pens) pens out of 58 that she had.\n\n### We can find the number of pens she gave them by multiplying 8 (the number of pens she gave out) with 2 (the rest of the pens) because her resting pens were 2. So she gave out 34 pens out of 40 pens she was holding.\n\n### Now is the time to modify both our equations to fit the new information we have.\n6.

{"text": "75 meters.\n\nYou might also notice that there are many other ways to answer this question correctly.\n1.  James drove 30m/h in half an hour and then drove twice the speed in twice the time. But since his speed doubled, he drove 30m in 15min, which is 75m in total.\n2. James drives at an average speed of 30m/hr. When he drives his car for 1 half hour at half the speed (30/2), he drives 30/2 times half an hour. He finishes by driving double of 30/2 for double the speed (30 x 2), this takes 2 times as long as the first 30/2 (which is 60 mins). So the total is: 30/2 x 60 mins which is 30/2/2*60 mins or 60 mins times 30/2 which is 30m/2 x 6mph x 2 hours, which gives you 75 m.\n\n### Input:(A) How many feet of yarn will you need for each blanket?

So, the correct way to represent the above contextual information is as follows:\n    3 x [(25 - x) \u2013 3] \n3. From the previous step, we can see there is an arithmetic relationship because each choice is connected with an amount of votes and the vote relationship to itself can be expressed by multiplied together.\n4. So, multiplying 7 by 7 we will express the total votes as 49, however, we must also subtract the number of votes that has the witch cake as the top item.

The student council is selling the erasers for a price of $ 0.75, resulting in a total revenue of $250. \n\nTo solve the problem, we utilized the formula of s($) = n + 24x. The value of x, which equals the total number of erasers sold, can be obtained by using a range of values to solve for y, which equals the total revenue. We can then use this value of y to solve for the value of x, at which point the total number of eraser sold can be found.\n\nAn example of how to solve the problem would be as follows:\n\n$$y + 1250 = 212.5$$\n\nSolving this equation yields $212. \n\nUsing the substitution $212 = y$, we can then find that $212 = 250$. \n\nAs such, $x = 5$, or five erasers. \n\nThis yields that $212 + 0.75 = 250$, which means that the student council sold five erasers and made an overall revenue of $212.75.", "answer": " 864"}

{"text": "The question asks about a scenario where John pays for half the cost for eight years and double the cost for 8 more years. Assuming John pays the full amount each year, we first find the total cost for all the years.\nThen, we need to subtract the half the cost for the first 8 year and double for 8 year to find the remaining cost. Since the question asks about the total cost, the answer is equal to the total cost minus the cost John have paid until the 16th year.\nSince the question is asking about the cost of that scenario, we want the most suitable answer possible.\nBy following this reasoning, the correct answer would simply be (2).\n\n### Rationales:\nStep 1: The first thing to address is identifying exactly what we are solving, to determine the best way to solve it.\n1. The question's wording implies three separate parts to be calculated:\na. the first eight years;\nb. the middle eight years after that; and\nc. total tuition costs.\n2. All three parts will have different variables (i.e., x, y, z) based on given parameters (i.e., 16 years, 10,00x, and 250,0z).\n3. We can apply the rules of substitution since we know the total cost of the child's education and the costs of raising the child for the first ten years.\n4. Based on those two known values, we can easily find the cost of raising the child (10,00y) and the cost of the first fifteen years (2(10,00z)).\nThe question then asks: how much does it cost? This is essentially just an asking the same question with a different variable (i.e., z).\nStep 2: To solve the problem, we first rewrite the initial cost using some rules of substitution.\nLet:\na. The total cost for first eight years = 10,0$x\nb. The total cost for the other eight years = 160x\nC. (160x/8 years) + (2(10$x/8 years)) = 250,x\n250x = (120x)/8 + (20x)\n5$x = 120x/8\n5", "answer": " 265000"}

But to work out for the $x$, we multiply both the $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $13$ by the number of rabbits $\\frac{13}{3} \\times x = \\frac{13}{9} x$. But subtracting the $8$ from the $13$ of rabbits in the tank gives us a $-5$. Now we can factor the $x$ out from the parentheses, and thus rewrite this to a form of $(\\frac{x}{9}) $- $5$. Next we take the absolute value of this equation and then simplify it, we get $(\\frac{x}{3})$ $- 5$. To make the fraction into an Integer, we multiply both sides of the equation by $3$. This changes the expression into $3$ $(\\frac{x}{6})$, which is simplified to $\\frac{3x}{2}$. Taking the $\\frac{3x} {2}$ to the other side of the $x$ and simplifying will give us $1\\frac{3x}{3}$.

If 11 = 1/4 of 52, then 11 = 28/4, which is 7.25. But 12 x 7 is 84, not 52. He would indeed finish 1/4 of the remaining ceilings by painting 12 of them last week.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe first step to answering this problem is to identify the context. The given statements and the information given in it states that Michelangelo needs to paint 28 ceilels to complete the task asked. He has 3 weeks to complete the task.\n\nHowever, it is given that he paints the 12 ceilings in the 1st week. Next week, he starts painting the remaining number of ceilings.

To calculate the expected number of songs let us begin with set one, which had five songs. Set one played each of the five songs, so we know they played the same number of songs each time, because of this it would be easier for them to pick songs to play again based on the ones they played in Set 1. As the expected number of songs played per set is 5, but since Set 1 played all five songs the expected amount should be 5 after you subtract the number of songs already used and the ones played already. This would be (15-5)=10\n\nNext we will look into set two, this set also played seven songs and it repeated some of the same songs that it had in the previous set, this is because it is playing those same ones to make the audience feel they had heard all of there music or just to mix up the order of the songs. But since they played them once in set one, and then again in set two, we assume that they need to repeat at least 4 of the seven songs, ( 7-4)=3 remaining, but since there was five songs in set 1 it is fair to say we would also repeat one more song from set one (5-3-1)=1, so the total number of expected songs played in Set two would be (7-4)+1=3\n\nSo by adding up all the numbers we see how the expected number of songs to play in Set three and four would look at\n\n| Sets 3 and 4| (8-6-3) = 6 | 7-4)+1 = 3 |\n| (15-5) - (10-3-1) =12\n\nwe also know that this is because the encore played two songs, one was a play of the last two songs they played, and the other one will be a completely different song out of the song they left, so they will play a total of 12 songs.

Therefore, we are unable to directly equate values between the variables. Instead, when solving a problem of this kind, we should solve the variables one by one. \n\nTo find Saturday's box count, we can subtract 50 from 60 to get 10.

{"text": "```\nThe answer of this question is 4 ants.\nSolution:\nFrom the question we can see there are four children and each child sees fewer ants than the other children.\nSo to get the answer there are four simple formulas which we can use.\nfirstly, we can calculate the number of children who does not find ants.\n$$\n4-1=3\n$$\nSecondly, we can calculate children who sees lesser ants than others.\n$$\n4=3\n$$\nThirdly, we can calculate people who sees equal number of ants.\n$$ \n4=2\n$$\nFinally we can calculate children who see more ants than others. \n$$\n4=1\n$$\n\nTherefore, the answer of the question is 4 anst.\n```\n\n### Input\n```\nHow much is 2 times 4? \n```\n\n## Response\n```\n\nThe answer of the question is eight.\n\tSolution:\n\t\tI can see three forms of number. They are 2, 4 and 8. \n\t\tOne-digit number: \n\t\tI have to use addition. I also know that 4 is two higher than 2 so 2+4=6. If I add the two-digit number with one-digit, it is equal to the sum of that particular number. For our number, 2 is the less than 6, so I need to use subtraction. By using subtraction, I obtained my answer.\n\t\tTwo-digit number:\n\t\tI also know the number 8 which is after 4 and before 10, and the number 2 which is after 1 and before 3. If I add those numbers together, my sum is equal to the total number of the word 'twenty'.\n\t\tThree-digit number:\n \t\tI know that the last digit, which is number 8, is bigger than the last three digits of my number. If I subtract 8 from the number, I will get my number.\n\tFinal Answer = 2 X 4 = 8 = 8\n```\n\n## Input\n```\nHow many minutes passed in one hour?\n```\n## Possible Responses\n```\nThe answer is minutes.\nSolution: For 1 hour", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": "Choices: A: 43.9 years B: 6.9 years C: 54.9 years D: 8.9 years E: 41.4 years\n\n### Rationales:\n1. This question can be solved after solving a sub-question: If a fish is well cared for, how long can it live? The answer will be the same regardless of whether the dog-hamster pair can be used to find the answer as the length of a fish life doesn't depend on their dog lifespan as it's irrelevant to that choice.\n2. We need to understand the meanings of well-cared fish, dogs, and hamsters in the question. \n3. Well-cared fish, for this example, means the fish is properly nourished and healthy, leading to a longer life.\n4. The question is not asking for an estimate of the average life expectancy of a fish without any care, but of just well-cared fish. \n5. The answer then, using the logic explained above, will be 8.9 years.\n6. That means the fish can be expected to live 4.5 years more than what happens without proper care.\n7. Using that information alongside the question, we know the fish will live 4.5 times 4.5 years, which is about 22 years. \n8. 4.5 times the fish mean life expectancy, if well-cared for is 8.9 years, so the answer is 22 years.\n\n### Inputs:\n- A: I'm going for breakfast.\n- B: Good choice.\n\n- A: Would you like to come with me?\n- B: Yes.\n- A: Good.\n- B: There is this little caf\u00e9 around the corner where we can get bread.\n\n- A and B are going to a restaurant at lunch time.\n- A: I know, it's nice.\n- B: Exactly.\n- A: How about we eat there.\n- B: Yes, sounds great.\n\n### Outputs:\n- B: There's a little caf\u00e9 around the next corner where we can get some bread.\n\n### Rationale:\n1.

{"text": "Harris will spend up to $.10 per day on organic carrots. There are 5 carrot in a pound, so for the first 5 days, he will have to buy 1 pound of carrot and for the remaining 4 days in a year, he will have to finish each day without carrots. Each pound cost $2, so, on the first 5 days in a year, Harris will spend $10 on carrots. That was for 5 pound of carrots each and for each remaining day in a year, he spends $0 on carrots, making a total cost of $10 per day. On a year, he will spend a total of $360 just on organic carrotes.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Harris feeds his dog approximately 1 organic carrot over a whole day. \n2. There are 5 organic carrots in 1 pound bag so for the first 1 day in that 1 week, he will have to use a 5 pound bag of carrots and therefore he will have to fork up $10 for those 5 pounds.\n3. For the remaining 4 days over a year, Harris needs to finish day, not eating any organic carrot because Harris will have used the 15 pounds carrots during the said 5 days (1 day of organic carrots = 5 pounds of carrots). That's 15 pounds of carrotes in 5 days and 4 weeks and 1 day in a year.\n4. For these remaining 4 days, on every day, he doesn't spend a cent on carrots. So all together, Harris spends 17 days x $10 per day which is $170 every day on carrots.\n5. In a whole year, Harris spends 365 days x $10 which is a total of $3,650 just on carrots. \n6. However for our calculation, we take into account that his dog eats 1 organic carrots a day, so, we subtract 31 days in an year which is $10 per day (365 \u2013 31) x $10 = $360 every year on organic carroats", "answer": " 146"}
{"text": "He pays $268.\n\n### Explaination:  To understand how much does he pay, let us understand how we came up with a solution.\n\n### We can conclude the options from the question to be, $1.5, $1.50, $1.5 and $1.50\n\n### Now, let's make a small assumption that $1.5 is not the option, hence we now have the options in our formulation, $1.5 x 2 and $0.5 x 1.50\nThe first option is $3 and the second option is $3 since there is no factor for quantity.\n\n### So the cost per pill is $3 and the insurance coverage of 40% of cost.\n\n### The formula that works best here is 3 x number of pills + (3 x 0.4).\n\n### The cost of the pills is $1.50 in total because we have to pay $1.5 x quantity of pill \nwhich is, $268. \n\nWe hope that a detailed explanation makes it easy for you to understand the thought process and also makes it easy for you \nin the exam when you face questions of such nature.\n\n### In a more practical way,\n\n### Find out how much would it cost him for pills and the amount that insurance is covering. \n\n### For insurance coverage, let it be 0.5\n\n### So, when finding out the total, there is always a probability that 50-50 of the cost will be covered by the insurance or not.\n\n### This can be simplified by using a probability graph\nThis is how we can find the actual value of 1+.5 and then 2+.5 and so on, 0+.5, which gives $1.\n\n### Now let us try to understand how $1.5 comes in the calculation:\n\n### Let's keep the 50%, insurance, in between, and find how much $1.5 could be covered by insurance.\n\n### Because $1.5 is the total, 50% of $1.5 is actually $0.75\n\n### Now in this example, $0.7", "answer": " 54"}

{"text": "Since 75% of the tadpole were let out of the bucket, 85% of the ones left in were tadpoles. Since there were 180 taddles total, this means the answer is 37.5\n\n### Rationale:\n\n#### Reason1:\nWe can't know since we don't know the exact number or the ones lost, which in this scenario is 75%.\nTherefore, we can only guess but not know.\n\n\n#### Answer1:\n1. This represents 180-75 = 105  tadpoles\n2. 0.85 * 105 = 87 (approx.)\n3. Hence answer = 87\n\n#### Reason2:\n\nThe rule states 75% of which is left.\nHence if you take 180-85, it is impossible to determine what is left or what is not in the scenario. Hence the answer is impossible to determine.\n\n\n#### Reason3:\n\nFrom the questions, we come to understand the 75% means that 75% of what is left.\nTherefore according to the logic, in the scenario we have 180- 75% of 180 in which 112.5 and remaining 67.5 is the answer you need to determine.\n\n#### Reason4:\nThe rule states 85% is what the answer is which means you have 85% of what was left in the scenario.\nThis means you have 87 as your answer and not the 88.", "answer": " 45"}

Choices:  Food A: all B: fresh C: cold D: raw E: processed\nRationales:\n1. The question is attempting to identify all types of food that can be classified as food.\n2. Option A, all, is a nonsensical answer which cannot be the case as there are many things that are not food.\n3. Option B, fresh, is not a type of food per se but instead a category, a way of classification of food items based on the condition at the time they are consumed. \n4. Option C, cold, also does not make sense since all food is not necessarily cold. There is definitely room for hot and warm food, even when the weather is cold outside.\n5. Option D, raw, might not be applicable to all food items, such as baked or fried items, and this is one of the ways to prepare it\n6. Option E, processed, is one type of food classification based on how it was processed. While all food can be classified as processed in the sense of it being made by a human, they are not all processed in the same way. Thus, this cannot be the only type of food.\n\n### In summary, from above discussions and analysis we can see that:\nFirst, there are three (3) ways to complete a task with an instruction in a task.  \n(1) Using knowledge of information to respond.

We store that information in a dictionary as well, but keyed with the painting number. Then we are going to calculate 'net_income'. This is similar to 'item_price' but we are going to sum over the item.\n\nOnce we have the information in a dictionary format, we can simply calculate the net_income using the'sum' function.

{"text": "Input: What method does a toy car have to stop from moving? Choices: \nA: wheels go slower \nB: breaks \nC: wheels go faster \nD: electricity\nRationales:\n1. Option A implies that a toy car that travels over a smooth surface stops by slowing down its wheels. This however cannot occur, as the wheels are not powerful enough to stop the car.\n2. Option C implies that a toy has car travels faster, and the wheels go faster, thereby causing the car to stop. This method is not possible, as the car would go too fast to stop using its wheels. There is a physical limit to how fast a toy car can go with a moving mechanism.\n3. Option B implies that the toy car breaks and stops its movement. This is a plausible option and the most probable explanation is that the car breaks and stops.\n4. Option D can be an option if there is some type of electronic or electrical power applied to the toy car. However, there is no information about how much power is used. Also, it is unclear if the type of battery or other power source provided is feasible for a toy car.\n5. Hence, we could choose from two probable answers, either B: brakes or D: electronic power.\n6. Therefore if the toy car has brakes then:\n\nRationales: Option D: electronic power implies that there is some type of electrical or electronic source is capable of applying power to the toy car's mechanisms to cause movement. \n7. The electrical power provided in a small toy car may not be sufficient to cause movement, but it could have some limited power source or be a simple toy car model. In this situation, it's hard to say if the electrical power can cause movement.\n8. Option B: brakes implies the toy car has some type of breaking mechanism that can stop the movement of the car. \n9. In this situation, we could conclude that the electricity powered the toy car' s mechanics that caused it to move, but the brakes were then used to stop the car. Thus, the correct answer would most likely be B: breaks.\n10. So, the answer would be\nB: brakes\n\n### Input:- What does a", "answer": " 1600"}

All 10 ice cream are bought during the purchasing of 10 drinks. 10 cakes are bought during the purchases of 5 ice cream and finally, the remaining quantity of 90 icecreams were bought during purchasing of 1 cake.So Betty used a total of (2*10+10*5+1*90) icecream after buying 10 drinks worth $2, 5 cakes worth $10 each and 1 icecream for $5 each. This sums up to a total of $170 which is the 1 ice cream cost. So the whole quantity after the completion of these purchases is (2*10+$2*10+5*10)+1*90+(1*90+1*90+5*1*90)= $210+20*90+450= $1060, so Betty spent $1060 in total or ($412+412+236).\n\nInput: You have a bag full of 18 oranges that are all the same.

Choices: A: Tiger B: Leopard C: Giraffe D: Ant E: Cow\n\n1 A: Tigers are generally monogamous mammals, meaning they only mate with one other female at any time in their lifespan. Each tiger litter typically consists of one to five cubs that are all identical to their mother. So, tigers cannot be both. 2 A: Leopards are also monogamous mamals, meaning they only have one mate at a time. They are one of the few types of cats that often display inbreeding while mating. Therefore, leopards cannot be both. 3 C: Giraffes have long been known for both displaying inbreeding and siring offspring with brothers or sisters. Therefore, giraffes are an option for both. 4 A: It's unlikely that an ant will always produce offspring with the same male in their colony, since ants are not monogamous and will typically have several mates in their lifespan as well as", "answer": " 10"}

If we apply the same concept, and she also gave away 1/3 of her brown shirting, she would be left with 17 brown shirts.\n\n26 - 13 = 13\n\n17 - 1/3 = 17\n\n13 + 17 = 30 shirts\n\nSo, if she had 26 in the first place, she has 26 - 15 = 11 blue shirts left and 26 - 2/5 or 3 shirts remaining.

When I say I got lost, I don\u2019t mean just a little lost. I mean I stayed gone for fifty-four days! Fifty-four days is a long time.\n \nDanger. It\u2019s not a word we use very much in our society. But in the wilderness, it\u2019s not just a word. It\u2019s the thing that rules all things. \n\nIn the book, the main character, Brian, is faced with danger from many directions: animals, nature, people, himself. He must figure out all of this danger and what to do with it. You could say Brian is in the wilderness to learn these things, but before that he has to be brave enough.\n \nEven if you don\u2019t get lost, there will always be times when danger threatens you. It\u2019s good to get a feel for danger. It\u2019s good for you to see how to handle dangers from different directions. Danger can even be a good thing.  We have two boys in the next cottage over.

D\nRationales: The correct term to use in place of \"the first number in a sequence\" is ______.\n1. Option A is incorrect. A sequence can have more than one start number, since a sequence can have no end. So, a sequence can be: \"3, 7, 9, \u2026\", or \"1, 3, 4, 6\", or \"1,2,3, \u2026\" - the sequence \"\u2026\" is infinite.\n2. Option C contains the word \"number\". A number can be just that - one number. Whereas a number sequence can have more than simply a single number.\n3. Option B contains the word \"first\". A sequence can't have a first - and certainly not first and last.\n4. Option D contains the word \"initial\". An initial is part of a name, surname, or title. When it comes to sequence - if we have a name, surname, and title, it isn't the one that has the initials we mean, it's the sequence - a list.\n5. Putting 1, 2, 3, \u2026 is a sequence of numbers - and none of those numbers has an initial - but rather is an actual, number. An initial is always an added character.\n6.

One cup full has a total of two full cups, 30 students x 40% is two full cups. One cup empty can have up to five full cups, 20% of 50 is five full cups. Since there are a total of 55 empty cups, which is 55 x 20 = 1100 empty cups full of 30 cups, there is a total of 1100 + 30 = 1130 cupcakes needed to make for 30 students.\n\n### Response Rationale:\n### Response:There are a total of 350 cupcakes (300 + 50) the classes and P.E. classes combined.

Cherries can also be used in dishes, such as a cherry pie, but this was not the intended answer in the question.\n3. Kale isn\u2019t really a vegetable so much as a type of leafy green.\n4. Mashers don\u2019t make for dishes as much as they make vegetables themselves.\n5. Onions definitely make for a great dish, being one of the most common ingredients in many recipes.\n6. Rutabaga would not make for a great dishes as they are much too undercooked when prepared this way.\n7. Turnips are another popular option for vegetable-based dishes, not least because of their strong flavor profile.\n8. If you had a Bell pepper, it could be used in lots of dishes, from a salad to salsa and other sauces. This is the correct answer.\n9.

{"text": "15, for the following reasons\n\n1. There were three cats, so we multiply the number times by 3 to get a total.\n2. The first cat meowed three times per minute, so it meowed 18 times in 5 minutes, which we multiply by 3 for the number of cats.\n3. The frequency at which the second cat meowed was double that of the first cat, so we multiply that time by 3 as well to end up with 54.\n4. The last cat meowed at one third, or a 1/3, the time at which the second cat was meowing. Multiplying 1/3 by 18 we get 6.\n5. There were 15 total meows from the three cats; one from each cat (3,18, and 6).\n\n### Rationale\n\nAfter reading the question, our primary goal became to determine how many meows the cats would make (5 minutes * 3 cats = 15 meows) while also being aware of the frequency with which the cats meowed.\n\nWe used the following steps to derive the answer.\n\n1. Determined that there were three cats.\n2. Multiplied the number of cats (3) by their frequency (3, 2, and 1).\n3. Determined that the frequency with which each cat meowed was as follows:\n    - First cat meowed three times a minute.\n    - Second cat meowed twice as often as the first cat and 2 * 3 = 6.\n    - Third cat meowed at a frequency of one-third that of the second cat and 1/3 * 6 = 2.\n4.

What does it mean to volunteer at the shelter? Volunteering at the shelter means that we need to answer 24 hours because 2 hours a month is 24, that's about 2 hours a week, and that is what we are required to answer.\n2.

{"text": "At first, we can get a rough estimate of the number of trains by looking at the questions presented below:\n1. 5 years are divided by Max's birthday, so there are approximately **5.85** birthdays in each of the 5 years.\n2. 5.85 birthdays in each of 5 years means each year the boy gets **5.85 * 5** = approximately **30** trains.\n3. Because of the way the question is worded, the exact number of times the boy receives a gift doesn't matter, as long as he receives two gifts every Christmas and always receives every gift he asks for, the only thing we are concerned with is the yearly total gift distribution.\n4. We can use this information, the **30** trains given per year and Max's request for the specific types of gifts and the number of years requested, to evaluate Max's potential options and come up with an answer.\n5. First, the only way Max could get **5.85*5** trains in each of his birthdays is if every year, Max asks for **30 trains**, but is **given** **32 trains**. It would only matter if Max got more than two gifts if he received two gifts over **5.85 birthday**s in each year.\n7. In case of two gifts given per birthday, he could potentially get 30 * 2 = **60**, and that wouldn't apply to one of the birthdays, as he'll only be given two gifts in it.\n8. To summarize, all we need is the total number of **gifts** given to Max, and **20 trains** should be sufficient to cover all situations, even if the initial question may seem to suggest otherwise.\n9.

Choices: \nA: stopped at the pub\nB: asked the bartender a favor\nC: found the end of the rain\nD: realized that the rainbow was in her heart\nE: started yelling for leprechauns\nRationales: A: Stop at the pub: a friend is a general term and could be friends with multiple people. In the question, the word \"friend\" is directly linked to the word \"pub.\" The statement, \"stopped at the pub\", does not tell us much and could be associated with multiple people and different scenarios.\nB: Asked the bartender a favour: This is an action that is associated with one person, so it could fit the context and description of what happened when \"a friend\" stopped at the pub.\nC: Found the end of the rain: This answer does fit the context of the question and provides a general description of the next part of the story. However, this is too vague and doesn't give a concrete description of the situation.\nD: Realized that the rainbow was at her heart: This has more details to it, providing that the rainbow was not really found but was felt like the protagonist.

{"text": "60\n\nRationale: The first part of the question gave the number of hours Kenny played basketball, so we already know that is how many hours of basketball he subtracted in the total time.\n\nWe know that he ran for exactly half as long as he played on the basketball court, so we know that the basketball time is 10 hours.\n\nAlso, we know that twice as long as he spent running is 40 hours, so the basketball court time of 10 hours is the total play time, because we subtracted the running time from the basketball play time.\n\nNow, we know that twice the running time is the same as the basketball play time, so once again, 10 hours is our play time.\n\nAfter that, we know that Kenny ran for the same amount of time as he practiced the trumpet, so 10 hours was the running.\n\nAfter that is subtracted from the basketball play time of 10, then we know that the running was 10 hours. Once it is subtracted from 10, the trumpet is 10 hours, because it's equal to the basketball play time and we know that it is for twice as long as Kenny played basketball, and we know that the basketball play time was exactly 10 hours. So, the trumpet time is 10.\n\nThen, the basketball play time of the basketball court, plus the time that Kenny spent playing the basketball, minus the time that he practiced the basketball and the time he did run were exactly as same, so they are also 10 each.\n\nOnce it is subtracted from the running, the running is 10 also, because it is subtracted from both 2 times 5. Which shows that it equals 10.\nThis equals to the basketball play time, which equals 10, which equals 1 to our final answer. \nOur final answer is 10, or more generally 60.\n\n### 490", "answer": " 40"}

Therefore, we can multiply 30 minutes by 3 to get 90 minutes for one batch to finish in this first part. In the second part, we identify that the oven can only contain 2 pizzas per batch.

{"text": "### Demostration:\nTo figure out how many snacks are in the baggies, we must first understand how they would be distributed. Since Mile needs 64 pretzles, 4 times as many goldfish and 32 sucker, she can put those into 2 bags for each student in the class. For pretzels, her calculations show that they need to be divided into 40 pretzels per baggie. On the other hand, for goldfish, she needs to be divided 20 per baggie bag. Furthermore, for suckers, she needs 6 per baggie. For pretzels and goldfish, the total would be 40 pretzeli and 20 Goldfish for each baggie. Finally, for the sucker, the answer would be 6 suckers for each baggie. This would make 120 pretzels and 40 Goldfish for 40 suckers. Therefore, the answer would be b: 40 pretzeli and 40 Gold fish and 60 Suckers that would be shared by 16 students in the class.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe first step to solving this problem is to identify the number of pretzels, Goldfish, and suckers needed. Mile must divide each item by the total number of students, which in this case is 16. Therefore, one pretzel, one Goldfish, and one sucker represent one student share.\nThe second step is to determine how many pretzels, Gold fish, and suckers each bagge has. Since each class member gets four snacks, Mile must multiply by four to find number of pretzels in each baggie. She must also multiply by four to find the number of Goldfish, but must divide by four to get the number of pretzelf-in each baggie. Finally she must multiply by four again to find the number of suckers in each baggie.\nBased on the two steps, Mile must have 40 pretzles and 40 goldfish in each baggie. Since there are 16 member of the class, it would mean that she must have 120pretzels and 4goldfish in the baggie. \n\n### Input 1: What would you use a", "answer": " 22"}

We can calculate the regular croissant cost at $3.50 X 12, so it is $42.\n2. Similar to the regular croissant expenses, calculates the Almond Croissant cost to be $5.50 X 36, so that is a $198 cost.\n3.  Next, we know that Harrison purchases 1 croissant on Saturays and 1 croissant on Sundays, the total number of croissants is (12/7)(2)= 2.857 croissants.\n4. Thus, we know that the total amount of money Harrison spends on croissants is the sum of the total number of croissant Harrison buys X the Cost of each croissant.\n5.

The question implies the mathematical procedure for calculating the time taken by an elephant to walk 10 km.\n2. The first two choices, 31 and 24 are correct, but only once combined and rearranged (see explanation below ) can be identified as the correct answer\n3. Both choices D and E assume the elephant walks a full 24 hours to complete the walk, which is not possible because the question states that the 10 km walk will take only 6.5 days and not 1 year, as D and E assume.\n4. There will not be one single answer with a finite total, as there are multiple options that can be selected and used to count the 24 hours required and then combined with the 10 km to count for the total time taken.

{"text": "### Input answer to rationale:\n- Miles per hour is a unit of speed equal to 1 mile (statute mile). Thus, Arlene hiked a total of 124 miles at 6 hours. This works out to an average pace of 20 miles per hour.\n\n**Rationales:**\n\n```\n1. We can start by considering the choices. In this example, each choice would relate to a unit of time or distance. These would be the \"Miles per hour\" choice in the first question, the \"Day\" and \"Hours\" choices in the second question, and the choice \"Temperature\" in the third question.\n2. To interpret this correctly, we should evaluate the context of the question to determine which choice would be most applicable. In the first example, since the wording was \"Arlene hiking 24 miles in one day\", we know that the \"Miles per hours\" choice is the most applicable one. For example, in the first example, Arlene went on a day hike with a 60-lb backpack.\n3. In the second example, we can determine that the most applicable \"day\" and \"hours\" choices are one day and the hours that she hiked, given that the context of the question is about Arlene's trip to see the Rockies.\n4. In the third example, we analyze the units of \"temperature\" since the context deals with the hike. The choices are \"fahrenheit\" and \"kelvin\". Fahrenheit is a unit of measurement for temperature that goes by the formula T (degree fahrenheit) equals 5/9(T - 45). T is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

In order to get the total number of hours an employee spends on working and catching up throughout a week, we simply need to find the total number of hours he spends on work and add that to the number of hours he spents catching up, which would result in 4x3/2 on work days and 3x3/2 on weekends, or 4(30/2) = 15 hours on work days and 9(30/2)= 18 hours on weekends, with the total in one week being 15+18=33.

To understand it all better, let's explain the problem in words. We have a set amount of whole cherries (3), and an hour to pit all of them. So, we first need to divide one pound of cherry into 37.5 pitted cherries. Next, we need to calculate 37.5pitted cherries into how many hours it will take Veronica to finish her job.\n4.

{"text": "To get the number of meters required for fencing the flowerbed, we need to determine the lengths of the sides, the width, and the length. We can do this using the following equation:\n\n$$L = m + l = m + (m - 2) = 3m$$\n\nwhere L is the length, m is the width, and l is the length. We can then substantiate the values given in the problem.\n\n$$m = 4 \\\\ l = 1 \\\\ L = m + l = 4 + 1 = 5$$\n\nWe can then determine how many meters of fence we have. This is because we know that a fence is only on the sides, not the long sides, which represent the width to us. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$F = 4 + 5 = 9m$$\n\nWe know that there are two lengths: the long side and the short side. We can now apply this formula to both.\n\n$$L1 = L + l + 1 = 3m + 5m + 2 = 10m \\\\\nL2 = L - l - 1 = 3 - (m - 1) - 2 = 3$$\n\nWe can apply the same formula with the different lengths, substituting the values.\n\n$$F1 = L1 + l + 1 + 1 = 10 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 20m \\\\\nF2 = L2 + l + 1 - 1 = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9m \\\\\nF3 = L2 - l - 1 - 1 \\\\ 5 - (m - 3)  - 1 = 4 \\\\\nF4 = L1 - l - 1 + 1 \\\\ 3 - (m-2) - 2 + 2\\\\\n= 3 + 4 + 2 - 2 = 1$$\n\nThus, by applying the above formula, we see that there are four different lengths of the flowerbed's fence, with the following values:\nF1 = 20m\nF2 = 9m\nF3 = 4m\nF3 = F4 = 3m\n\n### Input:\"You are going to write a book, and you chose the title", "answer": " 22"}

{"text": "The first step towards solving this grade math problem is to identify the total number of candles available, which is 30. Next, it is important to understand the proportion of candles needed for each cupcake. To achieve this, we divide the available candles by the total number of cups needed (24 cupcakes x 1 cupcake per candle) to find that Stephanie needs an additional 12 candles to complete decorating the cupcakes. \nNext, to achieve a total of half 1 candles per cupcake, we add the additional 12 candle from the previous step with the original 30 candle and then divide both totals by two. This would provide a total of 51 additional candles needed.\nTo achieve the total of 2 candles per cupcaKe, we subtract the previous total of 51 from the original total of 30 (51 \u2013 30 = 21) and then would divide both totals by 2 once again. This would provide a final total of 9 additional candles needed. However, since Stephanie has already used 30 candles, she would need 39 additional candles to meet the desired arrangement.\nIn summary, Stephanie needs 12 additional candles for decorating half the cupcakes with one candle each, and needs to use 27 additional candles to decorate the other half of the cakes with 2 candle each, making a total of 39 candles needed.\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Demonsration:\nInput: What did a 6th-grade reader read?

The hamburger costs $2.1, the carrots cost $0.5, and the cookie costs $0.2. To make the total for all the lunches, we have to multiple the students and lunches. The first answer is $6,200, which is for all of the sides. The second answer is $46,000, which is all of the students times 2. Since $22,400 is a bigger number, we multiply it with $2.1 for the hamburger for all of the lunches. The last answer is $29,900.\n\nTo answer the question, we multiply the above answers together, giving us $197,500. This number is close to $200,000 but, to be exact and make one lunch menu for all the students, we multiply it by $2.10.

Choices: 7 days C 8 days E 9 days A 4 weeks D 5 weeks\nRationales:\n1. The question is concerned with the time required to save money for the purchase of a single item under two different saving scenarios; Weekly versus daily.\n2. Weekly purchases are made with earnings every week. Therefore, the number of days saved for that purchase is the number of weeks divided by 7. This leads us to answer choice B: 7 days.\n3. On the other hand, the daily purchase is made with payments from the daily earnings. This is the answer choice E: 9 days.  To clarify this answer, let's take it more step by step for each weekly and daily purchases. \n4. Firstly, for each weekly purchase, each payment made must cover all the goods bought for the week as one lump sum. \n5. Secondly, even if the woman had sufficient money for the weekly purchase, she would have to wait a week to replenish her money again.\n6. On the other hand for the daily purchase, there are less restrictions on how the woman makes daily purchases, as she is allowed to make multiple purchases, each one not necessarily covering all the goods bought for  each day.\n7.

They also enable me to avoid checking out my debt on paper. In a traditional credit card environment, banks or credit unions provide a piece of plastic which customers use to pay for purchases. In the 1900's paper statements were mailed to all credit account customers each month listing their most recent balances and other relevant information. At this time, consumers still typically carry large amounts of cash to purchase everyday items. With the advent of the internet, customers who are interested in checking their latest credit statement are able to do so online instead of receiving a paper mailing. The traditional plastic cards can also be replaced by virtual credit cards. As previously mentioned, virtual credit cards also provide consumers with information regarding their finances, but can only be used online or by phone. This type of credit card does not allow you to check your c", "answer": " 4"}

This sum will be subtracted from the total height of each rocket, and when combined they would be 550 ft.\nThe combined height will be 500 ft + 2000 + 4000  - 2000  -2000 - 500 = 550 ft", "answer": " 1500"}

He needs three packs of sandwiches to make the sandwiches.\n2. He can make the sandwiches with one pack of sandwiches.\n3. He needs two packs of sandwich to make the sandwich.\n\n#### Reasoning out the answer:\n\n-Firstly, from the context, we can see that the bread is measured in packs. Packs of bread have a limited number of slices. This means that each time we multiply the number of bread by the number of slices, we will get a pack. This can be done in one, two or three (or possibly more?) operations. By dividing each time by two, we can see that a pack is equal to two bread plus two \"packs\"/additions of bread. Since Jimmy started with no bread, he will need an initial addition of one pack. From here, we can see that by starting with no bread, he can use two packs plus two packs of bread to make the sandwich, or three packs of bread.\n-After dividing by 2 we get 2+2 (2 plus two packs) to indicate the first two sandwiches. This operation should go into the same pile as the sandwich, so that the sandwiches and bread remain separate but have the same total number of slices. (i.e. total number of slices and sandwiches go into the same piles)\n-The answer is that we use two (1) packs of sandwich.\n\n* Reasoned out based on the information from the example, it is easy to deduce that Jimmy needs 1 pack of sandwiches to complete the task. However, we haven\u2019t given a correct rational behind what he needs 1 pack of.", "answer": " 4"}

Tally that 3.5 eggs times 4 levels (small children, older children, and adults) times 37 seniors equals 124. Add the extra 25 omelets, giving us 150 eggs and finally add the initial 90 eggs and round the answer to 300. By calculating backwards and subtracting, we get a final answer of 300 that is close but not exactly correct. To figure out the remainder, we can estimate the extra egg required per omelet. We multiply 25 by 2 eggs. The answer should be 50. To get the true answer, we subtract the initial 90 and the extra 25 or 195 eggs and divide by the 2 eggs that makes each omelet. The answer is 94, which makes the final answer of the eggs needed close and to the exact number.\n\n### Input\n>The Rotary Club is trying to figure out how many eggs it needs to make 50 batches of 12 cupcakes without using any eggs leftover.

If 3 feet is cut from its sides, whose area is now 20 square feet? Choices:  I. The square II. The square's new cutout III. The original square IV. The square's cutout\nRationales:\nChoice I, the square: In general, the area is proportional to 1/size^2. The length of the side of the square is 10 feet and the breadth is 10 feet. Its perimeter is 40 ft, and its area is 100 square ft.\nChoice II, the new cutout: It was cut from the square making it the area of the original square is 20 square feet, which is a quarter of 100 square feet because 1/2 of 100 feet = 50 ft which makes the length of the side of this cutout is 5 feet and the breadth of the cutout is also 5 feet since there's no change in its length. Therefore, its perimeter is 10 ft and the area of the cutout equals 50 square feet.\nChoice III, original square: We are talking about 3 foot cut from sides, so we have a total of 6 square feet cut from sides. Adding 3 to 6, we get 9. By that, the new length of a side of the original square is equal to 9 feet and the new breadth is 9 feet.

{"text": "In total, the alligators walked for 10 hours from where they left to the river. They traveled 2 hours to the sea and 12 hours back to the same river on the opposite end of the trip.\n\n### Response Explanation:\nThis question requires a bit of work on your part. The first step is to identify the context of the problem. When we look at the question, it is clear that there are four different options to choose from for where the alligators started and where they ended.\n\nNow, we can use rationale to help us narrow down which one of those choices is the best fit for the question. The first thing is to rule out the four options that are not mentioned in the question text itself. Let's start with the first option (A) river. Although there's a river present in the picture, it is not referenced anywhere in the question.\n\nThe second option (B) Nile Delta is referenced twice, so we know that it is an appropriate choice. The Delta is a natural formation at the mouth of the River Nile, and it's located in Egypt. The next option, (C) Nile, is also mentioned in the question, so we know that this is an appropriate option. The Nile River is a 6,650-kilometer long river located in North Africa. It is the longest river in the African continent, and it's where the alligators live.\n\nThe last option, (E) sea, was a difficult one, but it is included in the question itself, so it's an appropriate choice. The sea is clearly a body of water that borders the land and can be traveled overland to reach the opposite side.\n\nWith our four choices narrowed to the appropriate ones, all we need to do now is to combine those choices to get the time it took for the alligators to make the journey. We know that Paul traveled 4 hours from his home at the Nile River to the Nile Deltas. We also know that Paul left with six alligators, and they traveled 2 more hours to the sea than Paul took to get to the delta.\n\nUsing information from this question, we can form a mathematical equation that will help us solve for x, or the total time. Therefore, X = A + B = 4 + 2 =", "answer": " 46"}

{"text": "68\n\n### Justification:\nSo if the original marbles that carl has are 12 marbles in the jar, the ones he drops are 6 marbles, but since they accidentally fall and get lost then there would now be 6 marbles left so the jar would be 18. Because of the first 25 marbles, the jar would become 43 marbles. Last, he takes out 10, so with the original 12 there would now be 22 in the jar. Since the final number would be 68, it would be the answer.\n\n### Input\n\n```\nMatt used a 25 lb. weight to help keep the weight of the kayak down.

{"text": "```\nThe question is, \"What does 12 standard care patients and 3 special care patients at dinner time take Missy?\"  First, I calculated how long it would take nurse Missy to feed three specialty patients their meal.  I then multiple this result by 12 which would be the number of standard care patients.  Then, I added 5 to this number to get the total number of minutes it took Missy to serve her patient their meal.  Her total time to serve dinner to the 15 standard care patients alone is (3 x 15 minutes) + 5 minutes = 21 minutes.  The total time for Missy to serve all of her patients is 21 minutes.\n```\n\n### Input#2:\n\n```\nI believe the question asks how many seconds it takes a car to drive along a road for the specified number of miles, without using any gasoline.  My logic for what I did was as follows.  Let \"m\" be the number of miles driven.  Then the question is asking for m seconds for the car to be driving.  I subtracted the answer from the original question, and I then converted the answer into seconds.  The answer to the question is seconds with the result of 18, which is m seconds. I used log to express the answer in seconds as log(18)/log(5) which is 2.16616616.... \n```\n### Response: \n```\nI interpreted the question as an exponential model with a second factor which is the number of miles to multiply by 5 seconds because the original question states that the car will be traveling 5 miles a second. My interpretation for the question then, is as follows.\nLet x be the number of minutes the car will be driving.\nThen, the number of miles driven in the time, x, will be 150.  Thus, x can be expressed as 150/5 as the number of seconds the car can drive, or y in the original question.\nNow, we would divide two numbers with a second that has the lowest exponent.  We divide x/5 to get 3. \nThen,\nI subtracted the answer from 18 (the original question). This then gave me 15.  I then converted the answer to seconds.  The answer", "answer": " 64"}

{"text": "0 \n### Explanation: The math question is confusing and should be rephrased. The first step in problem solving is to simplify equations into a form that makes them easier to work. The easiest way to do this is by dividing the equation by 100% to get 10/100 and 4/100. The next step is to figure out the number to which the percentages refer. In this case, they refer to the 20 boxes of 5 pens. The number of pens refers to the number of pens from which to draw or subtract. There was only 1/2 left after splitting. From here, it is easier to solve the equation. In other words, divide 1 into 20 to get 1/20 pens. The two parts of the question were: 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 which results in 11/20 is the amount of pens left for Lenny.\n\n\n\n### Input :Lenny has six boxes of candles. She gives 30 75% to her teacher and  45 50% to people at her church.How many candles is left for her?\n\n### Demostration:\nResponse: 9 candles  \n\n### Input Answer : 0\n### Explanatory Answer: The instructions need to be clear. If the instructions are given as follows: 6 boxes. 30 divided by 75% = 41 divided by 50%= 39candles left. The question is asking how many candles are left after they were distributed.\n\n### Input answer: Lenny sold his six boxes of candles to which he gave 30 7/8% to his teacher and 45 3/4% to people at his church. How many candles remains?\n\n### response: 9\n### explanation: The percentage for the teacher and 45 and 3/4\n### input answer: Lenny sold 6 boxes of candles all to his 39 classmates.

{"text": "7\n\n### Explanation: 150 is added sugar / 1500 is the total amount (all sugars) so that means it's 15% added sugar then 5% is added sugar per day so his 2500 is 0.5% of a weeks intake or 1 day, so it would need to be 2 days worth of intake. 2 times 1500 calories is 3000, so divide that into his intake which is 150 cal from added sugar, which is 441 so 441 / 3 means it was ~5.5 days of intake. 3 would be a week so there is an extra 0.5/5.5 intake in excess, so 0.8, which rounds to an extra 7 bars of candy.\n\n### Input : There are five boxes that hold a pencil, a pen, a ruler, a highlighter, and a bic pen.

What is my best guess?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: You should say A. If the note you took is actually compliments, you might have to move some notes, but you don't want to take any note with a blue note on top that might be compliments. So you can be conservative knowing that there are at most 10 free blue notes. Otherwise if the note you take is complaints you will have to know, so you'd probably want to err on the side of taking the note (so a conservative solution with a low cost that says it's right 100% of the time). If you're wrong, you'll either get a complaints note, in which case you will need to move the current note that could have been compliments, or you will get a compliments note, in which case the move is free. \n\n### Response(17): A\n\nInput: What if there's a blue under one of the red notes instead from the 1st row up?\n\n### Demo-1:\nInput:  There is a blue under one of them. If we had no clue whatsoever, we'd be able to take any of those two notes with perfect certainty and not incur a cost. The solution should be to be conservative on the first one, because then you can be less conservative later, or else being less conservative here you'll have to move some compliments, which might lead to missing out on some later (forcing you to potentially guess all over again!). \n\n### Demo 2:\nInput: There's a blue under the note in the 3rd row.  I will take that blue note and put it into the compliments folder. My first step is to take it out of the red folder and put it into the blue bucket.

{"text": "44 (20+20)\n### Instruction 2:\nAnswer the following grade math questions, but do not provide the answer for the grade math question.\nInstead, identify and discuss the question or concept that would help you to answer the question.\nTo help you evaluate your response, review the hints and examples below.\n\n### Hint:\n1. Always identify the operation and the variable(s) that would make the question appropriate for the Grade 3+ skill.\n2. When solving math problems, always look for context.  This is a critical step in answering grade math and math practice questions. Including the context allows you to make connections to the question and to better answer the question.\n3.  When identifying how the question might be answered, always look for the question\u2019s context.\n\n### Example:\n### The answer is 10 because 2 multiplied by 5 is 10.\n### Answer: 50\n### Hint\n1.  The question asks how large an operation two numbers must be to be greater than 100. This type of question tests the grade 3+ operator precedence rule, which states that brackets and parentheses must be done first.\n2.  The context helps to determine how the question should be answered.  Because the question states that it must be two numbers and the answer must be ten larger than 100, it must use four digits.  So the question requires multiplication using two whole numbers, and a fourth digit that would result in a ten in the fourth place.\n3.  Because we know the correct answer when we know the correct operation, we should assume that the correct operation is multiplication.  So the answer is 4 multiplied by 10 or 40.\n\n### Math practice question\nWhat is 45% of 941?\n\n### Your response\nThe question asks for the percentage of 941.  Percentages are used to calculate a percentage of something. The percent means that one whole digit is already in the correct place.  For example, 12 percent means that 12 hundredths are in the correct place. What is the percent of 941 of the percent of 900?  This would depend on which digit would be the correct digit for 900.

{"text": "If we consider the ratio of the two prices we can see that at the grocery it is about 2 bucks per can more, or $24 per can more for $126 more.  So the sparkling water is at least twice as much at the grocery as at the warehouse.\n\n### Output:\n\n### Rationale:\nAs you can see the correct answer is $24 since the warehouse is selling canned sparkling\nwater for $12 and the grocery store is selling them for $6, the answer is (12-6)*2.

{"text": "This question was taken from a practice exam I took to prepare for a math test to get into the University. In this question and many other types of this question the answer has a step by step way of thinking. To accomplish the goal in this question there will be different ways to achieve it. One way is with proportions because there is a certain number, 10(minutes) the 20(hotdogs) was eaten in and the 75(hotdogs) is being eaten overall. Another way is with percent and ratios and finally by using equations to find a constant that is being used to solve this problem.\n\n### Input The next 2 questions are taken from a practice exam of a mathematics test for University.\n\n### Response\nLets look at the first question,\n\n###\nA car is travelling at 50km/h and it passes at a traffic light and gets a green light. How much time will it take to travel 150m?\n###\n\nThis question is really easy but the key to getting it right is to put a little bit of thought into the question. Lets look at what it wants to know. This question is trying to measure speed against distance. By using 50km/hour for the speed, 150 meters for the distance and using 1 hour as 60 mins you will be able to get the answer by just plugging the 50 into 50hr=150m. If instead you want to get a better understanding of how the numbers apply, you can just use 50 as the total distance and then in the rest of the problem use 150/50=3, and then multiply the 3 by 60 to equal 180 seconds. If you take a glance at the solutions provided you will see the same answer.

So we have another 5 students.\n\n## Task #2:\nBelow is a code snippet. \nThis code, however, is not complete. It lacks a call to the method `generateCode`. Code that contains missing pieces is marked as \"undefined,\" a convention that is used to avoid using the verb \"miss\" in the presence of code. Instead, any code that has not been added to the program is referred to as undefined.\n\n**For example, the program below shows a call to method `generateCode`.**\n```\n        public static void Main(String[] args) {\n            generateCode();\n        }\n```\nIn other words, to refer to a missing piece of code, we use the \"undefined\" modifier. This tells other programmers that the missing piece is not defined at the present moment.\nIf more than one piece of code is missing, then make it clear by adding multiple `undefined` modifiers, as for example.\n```\nstatic void generateCode()\n{\n     // the first 2 parameters are the user. And the second is a password.\n     // These two parameters are only used to generate a password for the user.\n     generateCode(User user, String password)\n     {\n         // create code for an unidentified user.\n         // The code cannot be displayed to the user.\n     }\n     // the second method is the method that contains the complete code.\n     private static void displayCode(String code)\n     {\n          // code to be displayed is located here.\n     }\n}\n```\nAs long as all the undefined places are properly labeled, they can be filled in later as the program grows.\n\n### Note:\nYou don't need to fill in all of the undefined.\nIf you are stuck, post a question to the \"Ask a Question\" thread.\n\n### Example:\n```", "answer": " 37"}

To solve, we can start with the 2 children who have the largest number of children. For each one of those 2 who have 2 children each, that would give us 2 great grandchildren per each of them. We have a grand total of 2 * 2 which is equal to 8.\nThe sum would be 8 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 24.\n\nThe reasoning here is, to solve this question it is easier to start with the two children who had the highest number of children of the whole group. It is easier to pick out these children because they are the only ones who differ from the rest. To solve for the other 7 grandchildren, just add 2 for each of them because they don't make any difference in the answer of how many grandchildren they have. To end with the answer of how many overall grandchildren Max has, just add the answer of how many children Max has with the children of the child with the most children of the group.\n\n### Input\nWhat is the sum of the prime numbers between 5 and 11?\n\n### Demostration\nResponse: 97\n\n### Justification-A simple method to find the answer is to start at 5 and count the next number that is a prime number. When you get to 11, you have exhausted all the remaining numbers that were primes under 8 to the right. Then, you count the prime numbers to the left of 5 and subtract that from 8 (because of the way I counted I was using the formula of 5-n). Thus you have 5-97=92 as your answer.\n\n### Method 1-There are a few ways to find the answer and this is just one.\nStarting at 5 I counted the next prime number to the right at 7. 7-5 is 2; however, 5 is not included in the previous number of 2. So I subtracted 2-5 and was given 1-5. 1-5 = -4 and 4 is not divisible by 5. So I subtracted -4 back and got", "answer": " 58"}

{"text": "Dear Sheryl, \nYou asked for a flight engineer's help with how many gallons of aviation fuel you should load into your new aircraft for the 400 mile flight that it will make, when there are a whopping 36 passengers and 9 flight attendents.\n\nLet's first start by writing out an equation that will allow you to solve this equation when we know the answers to two things:\n - how many gallons per mile each person uses\n - how many people are on the aircraft\n - how many bags of fuel each person bought (this is an important detail, you neglected to ask her about those!).\n \n We will write the equation as a ratio:\n \n \\(G = \\frac{MP+B}{P}   \\\\(G=\\frac{Fuel}{Passengers}   \\\\(G=Fuel \\over P)\\) \n\n - M will represent the passengers' contribution\n - P will represent the people on the aircraft\n - B will represent the baggage contribution\n \n This ratio is not very useful, because we have no idea how many people are going on the trip or how many bags of each person will be on board. What if they just flew with one bag of fuel each? That would throw the equation in serious turmoil!\n \n Luckily, the equation is quite expressive. We can solve for \\(G\\) once we know everything else, since the only value that can change is the number of passengers. It turns out that this equation is linear, which means that you can solve for \\(G \\), once you know \\(P\\) and \\(B\\).\n \n But just how many gallons of gas will it take you to fly 400 miles? How are we going to do this?\n \n Let me introduce you to a very nifty way to add up rows of variables in a fraction. Here we go (note: 36 is the number of people on the aircraft, and 9 is the number of flight attendants):\n \n![](img/0.png)\n\n This would give us a total of:\n \n \\(36P \\cup 9B \\cup 36M\\)\n\n Now in our equation above, just replace the total with the value we found.\n \n \\(39B\\cup36M=61(G", "answer": " 106000"}

If the statement is asking what the year was, I will test how it fits into other years I came up with.\n- I will start with Wayne's year, and see that it will fit into 1983 as well.

{"text": "- ## Task 1: 5/11 bolts and 10/15=82.5% of the bolts used, ## The project took 6 days - each day the number of bolts available was cut in half. In the morning only 5/11 of the bolts were left from the previous day. ## The morning and evening count was always 5/11 - that number was constant. But by mid-day, in order to finish the project on time, the bolt inventory was cut in half. That process is mathematically represented by dividing by two. When the bolt inventory is decreased by half, that means he had 4/11 left in the morning and 2/11 left by mid-day. ## In order to have the 2/11 bolts available at the end of the project his 5/11 daily supply had to match up with 4/7 left over. ## 2/11 = 4/7, or ## 7/11+1/19  or ## 11/19 = 0.58. ## 1.9 (10%) equals ## 11% of ## 11. ## To keep working, there is a 11% chance that you have 11% left but it is likely you will have more, so there is a 10% chance you have enough left to reach 100%.", "answer": " 113"}

A \"boom\" is used to record sound. Sound is used to make voices audible. Consequently, a \"boom\" allows you to cover a news event.\n\nFor the fourth instruction, it gave me two options, \"Bloom\" and \"flowering.\" A blossom is a blouse. Bloom is the same as a blossom. Therefore, both of these mean blossoming. A blossom is typically the only way to make a plant bloom. Since this is a \"bloom,\" the only possibility was one that blooms.\n\nFor the last instruction, I knew that one gallon of paint will cover 600 feet because that is the case with a gallon of paint and 600 square foot wall. The walls in every room except the living room will cover 400 square foot, just as the word \"600\" has more square feet than 600.", "answer": " 3"}

I was a professional actor on the Portland stage for multiple years at two great theater companies. I grew up in a small rural area where my family owned and operated a local newspaper. I've always found myself creating as a means of self-expression and self-exploration. My journey has taken me through many different experiences and adventures that have inspired my artistic and creative interests. Each of the many artistic forms I enjoy is an exploration of the human condition. I believe storytelling is the main way we human beings relate to each other and find inspiration in the world around us.  I believe art is the ultimate expression of ourselves, our humanity, and the beauty in the world around us that we so often take for granted.

I am willing to learn, grow, adapt and explore anything that challenges my understanding of the self and the world around me.

{"text": "Eighty\n\n#### Notes:\nIn this problem, the question states \"If a group of spiders\u2026\". To understand this question, read the instructions and ask  \"What type of spiders is this?\"  Once you know that it refers to an entire group of spiders, then ask \"What do the spiders have?\" and \"What does the group of spiders have?\" Finally, ask \"How many times more spiders is there in this group than there are legs for a single (one) spider?\" Then you know that if there is a total of 24 legs for all (the group of spiders) there would be 15 (half the total) legs for the whole group.\n\n#### Explanation:\nThe total number of spiders in the group is 10 more than half of the number of spider legs for a single spider. There need to be 24 legs for the group of spiders as a whole, and 15 spider legs for the single spider. So we know that there are\n\n15 legs for the group of ten spiders or 10 legs for the whole group, and 15 legs for the single spiders.  So if there are 15 legs for a single spiders, this means that there have to be 24 spider legs available for the group of 10 spiders.  So the group of 15 spiders has an extra 10 legs on it, so there are a total of 34 legs in the group of spiders in the question plus the 24 original legs of a single spider.  There are a total of 58 legs for both groups combined.  This question asks about all spiders so it is asking for a total, not just one, of the group of 17 spiders.", "answer": " 112"}

Because 58 tables and 20 chairs were disposed of, there are a total of 680 furnitures remaining in the company. This sum is calculated as follows:5 times 20 times 8 equals 400, and 5 over 400 equals 0.125 which equals 8 tables with three legs. 30 times 5 equals 150 which equals 15 tables with five legs. 25 times 20 equals 500 which equals 20 tables with 3 legs and 40 over 500 which leaves 9 tables with five legs. Therefore, the total number of legs remaining is 9 table legs(9 times 5 equals 45) + 20 table legs(20 times 3 equals 60) +15 table legs(15 times 5 equals 75). 9 + 60 + 75 equals 144 legs.\n\n### Output: 144 legs is the answer.\n\n### Explanation: There are a total 680 furniture remaining, and 144 legs makes up the total legs of 680/3 = 226.667.

She also has a salary  of $80  per month.  She pays a share of the  household  taxes  each month.  At the end of this  month,  she had $18   left over.  How much  did she pay in tax this  month? \n| Input | Tax Amount: $15. Tax Amount: $3.  Money remaining each month: $3.  Total amount of expenses that Angelia has to cover each month: $80.  Amount after expenses: $80.00 - $42.00 = $38.00.  The tax is a total of  $3 - 38 - 18 = $7.00.  Therefore each month Angelia pays $7.00 in tax to the household. \n| Input | Money remaining each month = $18. Total amount of expenses she has to cover each month = $80 - $80 = $180. The tax amount is $3. Angie's salary is $400.\n\n### Example Answer:\n| | | | | |", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "There were five groups of people, 50 per group drank one type of drink and 50 per group recycled.  Each group recycled half of what they drank, giving us 25 drinkers with 12.5 juices recycled.  Of the remainder, 25 drank sparkling water and they recycled 30 drinks.  Lastly, 100 recycled 50 bottles of juice because each drank five.  The last 12 juice drinkers did not recycle.

The problem tells me 50 cans per group but because 4/5 of each drink was consumed, 5/5 of the cans were recycled giving us 40.9 cans consumed.

So there are 40 cars with a spare tire. 40 cars x 4 tires = 64 wheels. 64 wheels + 40 wheels = 104 wheels. 104 tires + 16 tires (motorcycles) = 120 tires. 120 tire is 2 tires shy from your original answer of 132 tires, so there are 137 wheels in total.\n                    30% of the cars are motorcycles.

The two numbers 26 and 1/2 add up to 27.\n26 + 1/2 = 27  \n60 % of 1/2 = (0.6 x 1/2) = 0.3.  \n60 % - 0.3 = 59.7.  \n59.7 - 60.095% of 20 = 1.31 - 12\n\n\n### Input(Questions 8 and 10)\n\n**Input(Question 11)**\n\n8\n\n### Input : **Ice cream comes from a mixture of milk, cream and sugar**\n\n11\n\n### Instructions :  This sentence is from the \"Food\" topic of a textbook.", "answer": " 100"}

The logic of the question is often obscure in these questions, so you have to read every word very carefully and make sure to fully understand what the question asks before trying to answer it. When faced with questions such as this one, try not to make assumptions like \"what do they mean by doubled?\" because these assumptions will lead you in the wrong direction and cause you to waste time answering the wrong question. If you are taking this test for a job, don't be surprised to see questions like these that require you to think things out at length.", "answer": " 60"}

In months two to four, the farmer needs 10 bales of grass each month. The farmer needs to harvest 600 bales of hay. After that, the farmer would still be short by another 15 bales.

However, there are many other 2-year-olds who claim to have first-year badges so your peers can't all sit back with you. What is the best way to assign seats to your new peers so that as many 2-year-old peers are happy as possible while having a least possible number of 2-year-older?\n\n### Demo:\n(See the table below)\n\n### Instructor Notes\nThis question asks to assign seats to 2-year-older and 2-year-children on a school bus. The table below shows an example answer to this question. An answer is a valid assignment of seats if no two 2-year-childrens can be seated to a seat they both claim. See the second column `Number of children who are not happy` to see how many of the children not happy at a given time (ie, there is a problem to solve). There are many such assignments, and the number of children not happy at a time are the same, so the minimum number of 2-children can be happy at all times. However, if we do not fix the seats once they are assigned, some children may not be at a time happy at a given time more than other children.\n\n## Instructions\nFix your seat (or seats", "answer": " 504"}

{"text": "In order to answer the question, the first step is determing what numbers we need. We can quickly see that we need three variables. One of the variables has to be unknown and we have to assign a value to that variable. To determine how to assign a value to the unknown variable, we first need to use the equation provided in the question that tells us how to compute Cindy's age. In addition, we will need the relationship of age difference between Cindy and her oldest sister.\n\nSubstituting the information given in the question into the equation, we obtain: Cindy = 5 + 2(Jan - 2)(Marcia + (Greg - 2)). We can simplify this to get Jan + (2(Marcia + (Grag - 2)) = 5 with a value of 9 for (Greg - 1). Hence, Marcia + (Grav - 1) = 8.\n\nWe can plug this into the original equation and solve:\n\nCindy = 5(Jan - (2(Marcia - 9))) = 5(8+2(Marcia -9))  = Cindy = 60\n\nGreg's age can then computed to be:\n\nGreg = 2(Marcia - Jan) + 2 <--- (original question)\n\nGreg =  2(2(8 -9) + 2) = Greg = 18.", "answer": " 16"}

Since there are 4 corn cobs to a row, we subtracted together 4 from 16 to get that 12 rows of corn cobs are filled. We took the number of full rows for each of the fields, and divided it by 12 for each field.

In one company, for example, the volume traded reached 583,520 on December 20, 2006. If the company's stock always trades in numbers of 1000 shares, how many shares were there in the 583,000 stock being traded on December 20?\n\nNotice that the number of shares is being calculated in the format of 5000 because the trading volume was in the thousand format. In the format of 583, 000, the calculation is to find what's being traded in the format of 100,000 shares and convert it to 5000 shares for the volume of trade. The calculation for trading volume is ((583,020) / 100 = 5830.2, which is 5,830,200 / 100 (to find 5,83,200 in thousand format) => 58,320 units.

{"text": "43 minutes\n\n###  Rationale:\nThe question asks \"What can he do to shorten his commute?\" The correct answer is Option 2. \"The second option does not include any stop lights and will take 14 minutes.\" 14 + 3(x) < 10, so the man should choose Option 2.\n\n### Explanation\nThe scenario is a driver whose main concern was time. If there were no stop lights, he would take 14 minutes. If he stopped at the lights, one at a time, it would take 10 minutes (assuming each light was green). We can rewrite it as 10 + 1 + 1, which would take 12 minutes (but 1 minute wasted on his was at the light). We can rewrite this equation once more for 14, which would give us:\n\n(10 + 1) + 1 + 2\n\nThis gives us a 2 minute buffer before the driver reaches the next stop light.  If there are three lights, the driver will need 2 minutes between each light. (10 min + 1 min) + 3 x 2 = 14 minutes.\n\n### Comments\nI agree with this answer.\n\n### 1", "answer": " 5"}

You may use any language you like. Your solutions must use a data type (e. g. integer, string) to store values within your program. You cannot use data structures (e. g. Array or list) in your solutions.\n\n### Example:\n\n    input: What time is it?\n    answer: 8:30\n\n### Instructor Input:\n\n    input:[5, 6, 7]\n    answer: 30\n\n## Programming Challenge\n\n### Challenge1:\nWrite a program to convert an integer number to roman numerals. Your program should use the formula: M-X=Y where the roman numeral for the number X (or M) is subtracted from the value of the roman numeral for unit (Y), with any remaining value becoming the new unit. It should run without any need for any user input or input validation, since it is obvious that zero should never be used as a unit.\nIf you write the code in Python, you must use the built in function to check for division by zero error.\n\n### Challenge2:\nWrite a program that will print out the first 21 prime numbers, and display the count of the unique occurrences of each. It should be printed out in the format:\n\n    num_occurrences\n    15\n    11\n    7\n    3\n    2\n    1\n\nYou can use any type of data storing methods that you like (including arrays and lists, see above).\n\n### Challenge3:", "answer": " 204"}

The answer is $6,750.\n\n### Input2:Ellen is a salesperson who works at a store that sells electronic devices. If one of the products is a smartphone. An employee at the store makes $7 per hour and works 25% more than the salesperson. That employee earns $11 per hour. The total sales for the smartphones are 808. What is the hourly rate of the saleperson?\n\n### Demostration:\nThe question states Ellen is a salesperson. She works at a store called \"Device store\". The stores employees, besides the salesperson earn $7 per hour. Therefore, I would assume the salesperson earns $7 per hour. The question also states \"An employee at the store makes 25% more [than] the salesperson\". The store would have sold 808 smartphones. So I will say the employees that work there besides the salesperson have earned their sales percentage of $7 per hour. So if the employees working has 25% of $7, I will subtract 7, which is $7. Then, I will add 25% or.25 to 11 which is $11.625 now I will divide 11.62 by what the salesperson earns. The answer to 8.4% the salesperson is in fact making.\n\n### Response2:\nThe question states the salesperson is making $7/50 an hour. The hourly rate is what the salesperson is making per hour. If they work the 80 hours that is $560. The question states one product is a smartphone. Therefore, I will say that the smartphone sales is multiplied by 808 because there were 808 smartphone products sold. The smartphone sales are $7/50 x 808 = $48,090. The question states \"An employee at this store makes $11/50 more than the salesperson\". Since we know that the employee makes $11, we will take $11 minus $", "answer": " 1050"}

I thought the mechanic was going to say that the buses are out of service. I have to call to find out what is happening. Sometimes the buses have to be cleaned because people do not want to smell anything. However, I usually do not have to stand on the bus because I found this great website about the schedules and the routes of the buses. The website is busschedule.org. They have the transportation schedules online. I can also call a transportation bus because they call me, if they are running too late. They do not have the drivers call me unless the bus is going to be late. I wish I could use the buses more often because I would not have to go buy my own gas for my car.\n\n### Corrected passage:\nMy car is still in the mechanics shop although the mechanics said it would be back this week. This should not be a problem because I am able to gain access to different transportation networks such as the bus, the bike, and carpooling. However, this morning I found out that the buses have been out of service because of snow. This is unusual because snow does not usually cause much disruption to the public transportation systems. Usually, I do not have to stand at the bus stop anymore. I can just go to the bus schedule online service to find out when the next bus is departing and if it has arrived at the bus stop yet.

Write a response that correctly answer the question.\n\n## What does it mean to create an object?\nAn object is an occurrence of a class. You have to have a data type first to be able to start creating objects. This allows the object to become independent of the type, such as a specific class.\n\n## A variable is something that represents another thing to use in a program.\n\n## What is a class?\nA class is the same as a namespace. It is a data type that represents the data that is going to be associated with that particular class.\n\n## What are encapsulated types created in one object?\nEncapsulated types are classes that are packaged in one object, they only have one class at a time. This makes the object smaller, allowing it to run better and faster.\n\n## What data type represents objects and the methods that they are associated with?\nAn object is data that is packaged in one place, with access to all associated methods of that item. This allows the object itself to be more user friendly because there is no data type used for creating methods.

{"text": "50 marbles\n\n### Explanation:\nThere is an equation to determine the answer to this question. We have two equations:\n\nx + y = 28; y - x = 12\n\nWhen you solve those two equations, you get x = 12, and y = 28. We can easily replace the variables with numbers because the math doesn't change.\n\nx = 12 --> x = 12 --> 12 * 2 = 24 (we just replaced the variable x with its value of 12)\n\ny = 28 --> y = 28 --> 28 * 2 = 56\n\nNow we add all these values like so: (12) + (56) = 68, and we're done!\n\n### Note:\nThe variables used to create the two initial equations are irrelevant to the solution.\n\n### Input2:A train travels a distance of miles in 3 minutes.

I can create functions and loop through that function just as you would do math problems using a calculator. I can create classes and perform operations using an object oriented approach if so desired. I have a basic and fundamental understanding of what is going on in each and every line of code that was written. The only coding languages I had never seen before were CSS and Python, but I am familiar with HTML, CSS, and Python now. I have taken many hours of programming classes before, but this was my first coding class where I had to work solely on the computer coding away and creating projects for myself and others to try an learn.

{"text": "```\n12\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n```\nInput: Joel\u2019s garden is to be made up of 64 square feet of both fruit and vegetables. He states that he wants to use 16 square feet to grow strawberries. We can solve the problem using the system of linear equations. Joel states that the formula for creating a table is:\n\n```\nNumber of fruit * Number of Vegetables\n```\n\n```\nTherefore, we will first create a table to determine the total number of each type of produce.\n```\n\n```table\nFruit: 16\n```\n\n```Veggies 48```\n\n```\nNow, we will make a table of the total number of square feet for each kind of produce. \n```\n\n```Fruit: 8```\n```\n```\nVegetables: 56```\n\n```\nWe will now write our system of equations using these formulas to find the total number of square footage for the fruit section and vegetable section.\n```\n\n\n```Fruit = 8```\n```Vegetable = 56```\n```\n```Y = 56``` \n```\n```X = 8``` \n```\nAs you can see from above, there is an obvious solution which makes the vegetable produce use the remaining 56 inch. In order to apply this to the question, we will now solve the system to find the amount of square feet for the vegetable section, which we determine to be 48.\n```\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the strawberry patch will take up 12 square feet of the garden, and the tables will prove it.\n```\n\n## #haskell\n\n```haskell\n\ndata Point = Point x y deriving (Show, Read, Eq)\n\nadd :: Point -> Point -> Point\nadd (Point x1 y1) (Point x2 y2) = Point (x1 + x2) (y1 + y2)\n\nmult :: Point -> Point ->Point\nmult (Point x1 y) (Point x2 t) = Point (x2 * x1) (y + t)\n\ntranspose :: (f a,f b,f c) => a -> (b,c", "answer": " 8"}

On the back of the door was a name:  John Higgins, 1762.  After carefully examining the door with a magnifying glass, she noticed that its thickness seemed to be about four times its height and width;  it\u2019s rectangular in shape.  When she measured to see if the trap door truly was 123 cm x 64 cm, she found that its dimensions did not match; it was actually 182 cm x 91 cm, that is, it was 0.6200 times as long as it is wide.  She noted that in addition, a portion of the middle of the bottom of the door was missing.  Using the missing portion, she calculated that the door was 24.2 cm x 12.2 cm.  All of a sudden, she saw a large tiger spring into the tree line and she fled for her life, barely making it back to her camp, whereupon she sent a panic signal to the authorities.  A special unit of the forest service quickly arrived and, using their own measuring devices, verified her findings.  They then called in for military assistance.  The special forces unit arrived and began to examine all evidence left by the fleeing woman:  footprints, clothing, food and water, weaponry.  The military team became suspicious when it noted that the woman had worn two pair of sandals, which appeared to be identical and were 1 cm too small.  They also deduced that she had two identical pairs of trousers and three identical shirts.  Since the trousers had three pockets, one pocket had three identical shirts and one had three identical pairs of sandals, the military team also deduced that the woman had two identical purses, and inside of each purse were three identical cell phones which were 90% full.  The military team then observed all the remaining evidence and was able to identify the woman as having one of three common birthmarks in her area of the country.  They also believed that she had a tattoo of a star on her left shoulder.  Each of", "answer": " 58"}

Next is (58) with digits that all appear twice.

We can now calculate how many 48s and 85s must occur in the sum and this means the 48s will occur twice, as will 85. Therefore, in the sum of 108, 67 will be used once, 48 will be used twice, and 85 will be used twice. By symmetry, we only need to consider only the third 85 in the result.\nThis leaves a total of five times the leftmost digit is used from the original sum. Therefore, the sum of the digits in the sum has to be divisible by five.\n\nThis is equivalent to the sum of the", "answer": " 6"}

You want to make sure you're lifting as much weight as possible. A doctor is in charge of setting the weight according to your safety limits. Your doctor sets weight according to the formula Weight Limit = 31 + 7 (Age in Centuries) (if the weight limit is larger than the maximum weight, the limit is the maximum weight).

Choices: A: Mumbai, India B: Rome, Italy C: Rio de Janiero, Brazil D: San Francisco, California E: Sydney, Australia\n\n### Response to closest city: The answer to your question will depend greatly on the exact value of \"time the earth's spin slowest,\" since it varies throughout the day. \n\nTherefore, the time it takes for the earth to rotate 360\u00ba will vary throughout the day, with the result that the different cities will experience that event at different times. \n\nSydney, Australia, may be expected to have the smallest \"time the earth spins slowest\" at one time, because it is the farthest from the earth's axis. \n\nHowever, that does not necessarily mean that Sydney gets the smallest time slowest, since it may not be the case that Sydney would have the smallest time the earth spins slowed. \n\nSuch a comparison can be performed by first finding the value of time that the earth has rotated about half-way, which is denoted time \"t1.\" \n\nThen, the value of \"time the equator rotates around fastest\" is added to time \"t1.\" If that value (the second of two values) happens to be a value denoted \"t2,\" then the following equation may be used to compare \"time the earth' s rotation slowest\" to time \"t2:\" \n\n((t1+t2)/2) - time \"t2\"\n\nThe result of the equation yields the magnitude of the time the earth's rotation slowest is smaller than time \"t2.\" \n\nTherefore we may expect that \"time the earth rotates slowest\" in the farthest city, i.e. Sydney, Australia, is less than Sydney \"time the earth rotations slowest.\" \n\nAs an example, let us examine three cities in the farthest part of the world i.e. Australia, with an extreme case that may be assumed for \"time", "answer": " 80"}

How may passengers are currently on this bus?\n\n\n### Input 2\nPassenger Count: 5\n\n### DRAFT\n\n### Demos\nIf the bus starts its run and at the initial stopping area, they start the run with 10 passengers. Then at the second stopping area, there are 7 people that get on the bus but also 11 because it's 5 more than who got off. At the third stopping area, we get 5 people off and 12 come on which means that when we get to the number at the third stopping area, it's not 3.\n\n### What we'll build\nWe can have passengers count based on where they are on the bus route. We would use the variables to keep track of who was on, who left, and who was joining the group.\n\n### Output\nWe could use the passenger count to check if the bus is full so that we don't have to get on in the future.

{"text": "The pool holds 60 Gallons.  And the garden hose can fill an empty pool in 12 minutes, because the empty pool holds 60x1.6 gallons.  But that is if there is no leaking water, so what should it be with the leaking water if we assume that the leak is 0.1 gallon per minute?  Let y=60-l be 60 gallons-leak of water.  Then the leak of water in y minutes is 60-ly.  How to find the total water that is put in the pool is \n1.6 gallons/minute. 60-y=60.16.6=72-y which is water that is not leaked.  Therefore the total water in pool is 72-y which takes a summit to fill the whole pool of 72 and that's 16 more minutes.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n60 gallons / (1 gallon / 1.6 minutes) = 60 fill in a minute.  But 60 - 60 fill in 6.6 minutes (notice that its 0.1 x 6.6 not 0.1 per minute), leaving 12/6.6 in one minute, or 1.76\n\n60 Gallons - 60 = 0 so you have to take the left over 72 gallons / 1 minute of 60 in the end, this is 1.76 minutes and is incorrect.\n\nThe mistake in the question is that they assume the pipe was filling in an empty pool.", "answer": " 40"}

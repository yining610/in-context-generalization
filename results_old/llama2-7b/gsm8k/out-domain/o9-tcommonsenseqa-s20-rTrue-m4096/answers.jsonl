{"text": "Betty's parents gave her $15 and Grandparents gave her $30, which means Betty has $30 and she needs $60 more.\n\n### Input and Rationales: In the given question, we are asked to answer the question. In this question, we have information about Betty and we need to calculate the answer by adding the amount she has, that is $30 and her amount needed, that is $60. Then we subtract the amount she has from the amount she needs, that is $65. So we have the answer, that is $15, but we cannot calculate what she has and then her needed amount because we don't have enough information.

{"text": "The Monster ate in the 1st Century is equal to 1.3 x 847, or 1*847+1*847 +1*847.\n\n#### Rationale:\n\nThe question clearly states that each new ship has twice the people the last ship had. This means we know the monster eats 423 people on the most recent ship, so that is the amount the monster eats in the 100 years before the most recent ship.  So, we know 423 was eaten by the monster in the 101st year, then again in the 201st year, and the 301st year as well.\n\nThen, to find the amount of people eaten in the 1st century, we have to start at the first ship that the monster has eaten from and add the number of people eaten every 100 years, which is 847, to get the number of people eating in the 1st hundred year. (We know these are 847 people because we know each ship doubles in size, thus there are 847 total people on the first ship)\n\nThe amount of people eaten by the monstor in the first century is equal to (1+847) x (200+100) +1=42300 \n\nAnswer: 42300\n\n### Input & Outcome:\n\nSometimes it's hard to write a proper instruction.

{"text": "First, let's determine what the word \"uncommon\" means in this context. The phrase \"an uncommon card\" implies that the card is not a typical, or common, card. Rules out A.  \nNext, consider what the word \"common\" means relative to the word \"uncommon\". \"Common\" is the opposite of \"uncommon\" and means ordinary or typical. Rules out B.  \n\nFinally, the context of this sentence implies that the word \"uncommon cards\" means the same thing as \"rare cards\". \"Rare\" describes anything that is not usual or typical, but often only in a minor or superficial way.  For instance, we don't usually call someone \"rare\" because they have blue eyes, nor would we call an item \"rare\" if it was not well-known. By calling the cards \"rare\", we're implying that there are fewer of them than common cards and that they're quite valuable or different.  \n\nIn conclusion, the number of uncommon cards is the same as the number of rare cards.\n\n### Output:\n\nJohn bought 10 packs with his magic cards.  Each of those packs had 20 cards, with 1/4 of them being uncommon.   \n10 + 10/4 + 20\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 44 + 6 + 20, which is 66.   \n\nLet's break down each step that we followed to arrive at this answer.\n\nRule out A, which could be either the definition of \"uncommon\" or a synonym.  \nRule out B, since John's cards are not typical or common, we can't consider them ordinary and consider them as such.\n\nConsider that the word \"rare\" is used to describe something as a deviation from common instances, as explained in this question. Rare is used to describe the cards. \n\nTherefore, given the information within the question, the answer to the original question is 66.\n\n### Input The machine is very intricate.

{"text": "10\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: In the given statement, we have the following variables: 35, 105, 2, and 3\n\nRationales:The given statement talks about Marvin and Tina, and their fundraising for the class trip. \nThe class trip was funded by selling candy bars, and each candy bar costs 2 dollars.\n\n1. Marvin sold 3 more candy bars, hence he sold 35 cents worth of candy bars.\n2. So, Marvin sold: 35 x 2 = $70 \n\n3. Tina sold 3 times the candy bars sold by Marvin, also Tina earned three times the amount sold by Marvin, means she raised 3 times the amount of Marvin\n\n4. Therefore, Tina's total amount earned for the trip is $35 x 3 = 105 \n\n5. The difference between the amount Marvin earned and amount Tina earned is $105 - ($70). = $35\n\n6. Hence, Tina earned $ 105, and Marvin earned $ 70 for the class trip.\n\n7. So option D correctly answers the questions.\n\nInput: Marvin and Tina were both selling candy bars.

First observe that each student can be in a group or not be in a group.\n2. The total number of groups is 100 and the total number of students is 100. \n3. The probability that each student is in a group is 100/100, or 1. \n4. We subtract the probability of each student being in a group from 1 to get the number of students who are not in a group. \n5. Then that number will be at least 1 because any student who is not in a group is definitely not in a group. The number 1 cannot be subtracted from itself because that would mean it is subtracting from itself.\n6. Therefore the question asks what the number of students who aren't in a group is. Therefore, the number is at least 1 and at most 99.\n7. But since the question is asking about at most 25 then the number is at most 25. \n8. We can simplify this because the number is greater than 1 and we can replace the 100 with 100/99, and then simplify the number further. \n9. In all, the answer is 25. If it was more complicated, then this would have been a hard question.\n\n## Example 58\n\n1. There are 1000 objects in a box. What is the probability of choosing one object from the box and choosing a different one in the next draw?\n2. Considering the question states in the first instance that there are 10^3 objects in a box, the second draw, where the choice is for a different object, does not mean there is another identical 1000 object to choose", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "42.\n\n### Explanation:\nIn the given scenario, we can assume that the seashells Ali had at the start (180) were all in storage, so there are no other seashells in his \"collection\". Therefore, the initial step is to determine how many seashells the gifts to his friends and brothers add to the total. \n\nAli gave away 40 to his friends and 30 to his brothers, so the 70 total will add to the total.\nBut then he also sold half of the remaining total, therefore: \n\n50 + 70 = 120 remaining seashells.\n\nHowever, we also know that he started with 18 seashells in total. Therefore, starting with 180 we take away 132 to get the total of 48 remaining from the start. Then we deduct 70 (given away gifts) for a total of 78 remaining. \n\nTherefore, he ends up with 42 seashells.\n### Input:What color is sand?

{"text": "The answer is $310\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following grade math question and show all the steps used to reach the answer.\n\n### Question:\n\nInput: How many hours were in between the beginning and the middle of the shift? Choices: 12 hours A: 8 hours B: 4 hours C: 2 hours D: 5 hours E: 7 hours\n\nRationales: Let's firstly look at the question itself, which asks about the amount of time between the beginning and middle of a shift. We understand that the shift is something that has a specific start and end time, with the middle being somewhere in between.\n\nWith 12 hours given as the time between the beginning and the end of the shift, we can narrow our choices by ruling out options B, C, and D as they each total a number that is less than 12 hours. \n\nWe can then analyze each of the remaining options individually, noting that options A and E each total 8 hours. While A's total exceeds the given number of hours, it's unlikely that the amount between the beginning and middle would be more than 9 hours and then another 3. \n\nGiven how A's total of 8 hours exceeds what's expected, we can comfortably rule out this choice. Considering choice E, however, the fact that it totals only 7 hours provides some suspicion as the beginning and end of a shift are likely 12 hours apart. \n\nAfter some thought, A might be the better choice, but it's still not the only logical answer. To confirm our answer, we'll need to use more critical thinking to determine whether E is truly wrong. \n\nReviewing our analysis so far, we note that C, the answer to the question, could potentially be E or A. Given this context, it's easiest to conclude that E is incorrect, and, although less certain, that A is the correct answer.\n\nChoice A is 8 hours, and we want the total number of hours which is greater than 8. We have to look at choices that are more than 8.\n\nEight has only one multiplier, 3 (8 x 3 = 24). Therefore, choices with more than 8 are: 9 (9 x 3 =", "answer": " 230"}

However, we like math - especially in 2+2=?\n\n1. A.I. is a field of study that involves the creation of systems that can learn and adapt to complex, uncertain, and evolving environments. A.I. systems use probabilistic reasoning, which is a branch of computer science that deals with the practical application of artificial intelligence in real-world scenarios. Probabilistic reasoning aims to solve problems by analyzing data and determining the probability of different outcomes, in order to calculate the best course of action with the highest likelihood of success. This process involves considering a wide range of possible scenarios and developing a model that accurately estimates the probability of each scenario.\n2. Probabilistic Reasoning is a technique used to make predictions and take informed decisions. These algorithms consider various inputs and predict outcomes based on the probability of each possible input combinations.\n3. The process involves three main stages: feature engineering, which involves extracting relevant features from the data; feature selection, which involves choosing the most relevant features for the task; and probabilistic modelling, which involves building models that predict the outcomes based on the selected features.\n4.

{"text": "He has $1.12.\n\n### Detailed Solution: \n\nLet us assume that the money Ravi has is $$X$$. Since he has 2 more quaters than nickels, his money is $$(2 + x) - x$$ which is $2 + x$ since there is no possibility that 2 quaters are equal to x.\n\nNext, he has 4 more dimes then quarters. Let $$y$$ be the number of dimes and $$y \\leq 4$$ so $$ x \\leq y \\times 10$. Hence his money is $$\\approx (2 + x \\times 10 - (2 + y)) \\times 10 = \\approx (2 + x -2y)$. Hence the total amount is approchimately $2 + X - (2 * y)$. Now assume that there are $n$ nickels and that he has $6$. This implies that $n \\approx 6$. Hence the total amount is $$ 2 + X - (4 * 10 - 2 * y)$$ so $$ (n + 2 - 1) + X - (4 - 2 * y) =$$. \n\nTherefore the total money is $5+ X - (2*y)$. The minimum number of coins he has are 5 and the maximum number he can have is 6. So the number of nickels is $1$ or $2$.\n\nBut now, the minimum number of quarters he can have are $6$ and the maximm number he can have is $7$. But his money is $5+X \\leq 10 = 1 + 9$. So now his money is $5$ so $$ n +2 - 1 = 5$$.\n\nTherefore the number of quarters he has is $5$. To find the number of dimes he has, his total money $$5 + (x - (n + 2) \\times 10) \\leq 10$$ so that x is between maximum + maximum and maximum - minimum, but he has exactly 4 dimes so his total money is $$ (5 + (4 * 16 - 7)) + (x - (6 + 1) \\times 16) = (5 + 64 - 6 * 16)$$.\n\nNow $5 + 6", "answer": " 350"}

{"text": "The 32 tables have 54 chairs in total.\n\n### Explanation:Consider the tables that have 2 chairs. At each table there are 2*2= 4 chairs in total, which makes 4*5=20 chairs overall. Do the same for the tables that have 3 chairs, we get 3*3 = 9 chairs overall. Therefore, the total number of chairs = (4+9) = 13. Now for the chairs that have 4 chairs in each table, we need to calculate the overall number of chairs in the case where 5 tables have 4 chairs, and 5 tables have 3 chairs. There are 5 tables with 3 chairs, 5*3=15 chairs. There are also 5 tables with 4 chairs so that makes 40 chairs. Therefore, for the 40 chairs, we have 5*5=25 chairs.

{"text": "1. 80 \u00f7 2 = 40cm and 80 \u00f7 (3 x 2) = 32cm\n\n### Rationales\n\n1. The question requires us to understand the relationship between Anne and her sister and Bella relative to each other. \n2. The question asks for this relationship so it's logical an answer would be 8cm or (40/80) \u2013 Bella's height. \n3. Since Bella's height is already known to be 80cm we can calculate for Anne's height to find that she is 80 cm.\n4. This leaves Anne and Bella's heights to be 80 cm and 32 cm, respectively.\n5. This is a unique case considering that both Anne and Bella have the same height in this relation, but the height difference is different between each pair. \n6. Furthermore, since Bella has a height difference of 3:2 with Anne and Anne a height difference of 2:1 with her sister, it can be inferred that Anne is taller than her sister by 8 cm. \n7. Given that Anne is 8 times as tall as her mother, we can easily deduct that her father is 1/8th her age. \n8. To calculate Anne's height, we can subtract her father's age from 100 times his age and this should be close to her height. \n9. This shows that Anne is taller and older than her sister.\n10. Based on the calculations, Bella is 83 cm shorter than Anne's sister and has a height difference of -63 cm. \n11. Taking away the known height of Anne, it can be easily deduced that Bella's height becomes 17 cm.\n12. This is a unique situation because Anne's height has a fixed 8 cm difference from her sister's height while Bella's height doesn't have a fixed difference. \n13. Her sister had a height of 80 cm, so Bella has to be 100 minus her sister's height (80) and that will give us Bella's height to be 17 cm shorter than Anne'a sister.\nAnswer: Bella's size is", "answer": " 200"}

{"text": "Option A: $104,000 is the  correct answer. \n\n### Rationales: For this question, we need first to understand the units involved in the question -'square feet'. We can then convert numbers from one to the other using the same conversion values in reverse i.e. ( sq ft / per sq ft = per sq ft  per sq ft / per sq. ft = sq ft ). For the price per square foot of a home, we need to multiply the square foot value by $98. But as the question asks how much is the entire property, we must now divide the house and barn's square footages together by the price per square foot for the home. Therefore: $98 x 1,002 + 1,007 = $98,016.60 $98 x 2,402 + 16,000 = $98,516.00 $100 x 3,402 + $44,500 = $104,546.00\n\n### Input.

'was really nice and was very' is a correct sentence, but instead of 'was really nice and', the word 'however' has to be written to fix the sentence: 'However, was really nice and was' becomes 'was really nice and'.

{"text": "It will cost Martha $10.00 +\n\n### Rationale:\n#### Evaluation:\nStart by evaluating the information on the quantity (amount) of frozen berries and heavy cream needed to make the flavors of ice cream that Martha wants:\n1. 4 cups of strawberries => 1 cup for each of the 4 quarts of strawberry ice-cream\n2. 2 cups of raspberries => 1/2 cup for each of the two quarts of raspberry ice-cream.\n3. 4 cups heavy cream => 1/4 cup for each of the quarts of strawberries and raspberries.\n\nWe can then determine the price-per-cup for the strawberries and heavy cream:\n1. strawberries $3.00/2 cups (2-fold) $1.50\n2. raspberry $5.00/2cups (2-fold$2.50\n3. cream $4.00/4 cups (4-fold) $1\n\nSumming up the cost of each ingredient, we find the cost of materials.\n\n#### Summarization:\nLet's summarize all of the ingredients in an equation so we can subtract any common factor out.\n\n```\n1 Qt.

{"text": "If we examine  what happened to each of these types of fruit, we see that all the apple varieties and the berry, the plums, each lost half of the fruit that was placed in the bag.  However, none of the other fruits were affected and all those fruit still remained in the bag after the half-fall.  As for the number of apples she purchased, we know that she purchased six total.  Therefore, as each apple was removed from the bag to reduce the number of pieces so that the total would be divisible by seven, there would be an equal number of apple pieces remaining.  Now, we need to know how many apple pieces she bought.  There are three different varieties of apple here, each with a different number of total pieces.  From her initial basket of pears, the original number of pieces would have been 6.  She would have purchased two total pears, so each pear would have lost half, leaving 3 pieces.  The same can be said for the 2 pineappers: there were 4 pineapples in the initial bag, so they would have lost half each, leaving 2 pieces of each type of pineapple in the bag.  It's easy to see then that there would have been 5 total pieces of both types of Apples, and that there would remain 4 pieces of each type of Pineapples.  There would also be 2 pieces of plums in the bag at this point, which means that she had 6 total plums in her bag and would have bought 4 of them initially.  Since she had 6, and bought 4, 2 would remain in the bag, and that is the answer that is sought.\n\n### Input\n\nFishing is a popular hobby, done near many different bodies of water.

Given that V = 8 lb/qt (a cup is 8 fluid ounces (fl.oz.), so l = 8 cups/qt), the volume of milk is approximately 2.0886 \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup> qt/d (for 3 gallons = 0.33 qt / day).

Choices: A: I won't be here for long B: I prefer to stay inside C: I'll do what I have to do D: I hope I won't have a problem E: I don't like the rain\nRationales: The question asks which sentence best expresses your attitude about not walking to the grocery stores in the rain. A: I won' walk for long time doesn't explain your attitude at all. Since you are using your car, it indicates that you are not satisfied with the way of transportation, so your attitude is closer to \"I choose to stay inside\", however that sentence doesn't directly explain your attitude either. B: I prefer to indoors is the most similar sentence, but doesn't express your attitude the way it should be, like \" I hate being outside when it rains\". D: I hope I don't have a problem doesn't express an attitude either. You don't mind walking outside when it's raining, so this sentence is not a proper answer for your attitude", "answer": " 3500"}

{"text": "The average distance Terese runs each day is approximately 4.0 miles.\n\n### Rationale:\nFirst, let's look at the formula for average. It is:\n\n`Average = (Total count of number of items in the set) / (count of items in the set)`\n\nPutting it into equation format would be:\n\n`((4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4) / 4) rounded down`\n\nWe can round down to the nearest whole number since we are not looking for a decimal value. Our calculations with place values are as follows:\n\n1. 4.2  = 4\n2. 3.8  = 3\n3. 3.6  = 3\n4. 4.4  = 4\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n`(((4 + 3 + 3 + 4) / 4 rounded down) / 4)) rounded down`\n\n`(((5 + 2 + 2 + 5) / 4 rounded) / 4)) = 4  rounded down`\n\n4.

In case anyone doesn't know what it means, you can refer to the internet, or it can be inferred that it is a process to formally accuse a public official of an offense.\n* The word \"process\" appears in the question, and the subject is public officials. So this word represents a legal action that happens in a trial environment, with jury members, a judge, an attorney representing both the prosecution and the defendant, witnesses, and public spectators. The process to formally accuse the US president was conducted by the US House of Representatives. It was initiated by the Democrats and is also an impeachment process.\n* 2019 impeachment hearings started in September with the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and the Judiciary Committee. \n* After the articles (or charges) of impeachment were made against Donald Trump on 9 December, the final vote to decide whether Donald Trump was to be impeached was taken on the 18th. The US House of Representatives then proceeded to send two articles to the senate. This is what the final sentence of the question indicates - and when this happened was 15 January, 2020.\n\n\n### Demystification\n\nThe question asks for the day and month that a particular process was finalized on. The process in question is the 2019 US President Impeachment Hearings, and this occurred on 18th December (day & month format).\n\n\n### Write out the explanation for your response\n\n  The question", "answer": " 45"}

{"text": "B: $23.67\n\n### Rationale:There are six choices, one for each person who contributed to the total donation amount. This is because Cindy, Eric, Garrick, and Ivy each put in a different amount of coins, making the total number of pennies in the pond different each time they added money. This can be shown using the formula:  Total  =  Sum of Cindy + Sum of Eric + Sum of Garrick + Sum of Ivy.\n\n### Expansion:A) Cindy tossed 5 dimes into a wishing well, and Eric flipped 3 quarters.  If Eric was able to retrieve a quarter, how much would he have to pay in total to take the quarter out of the pond?  B) Garrick threw in 8 nickels and then Ivy dropped in 60 pennied. How many pennies does each person throw in?  C) Cindy throws in 5 dimes, then Garrick throws in eight nickels.  Which person threw in more coins?   D) Which person threw in more pennies?\n\n### Reword:Given the information presented from the input above, it appears that a game is being played where multiple players take turns putting different coin combinations and adding up the total number of pence. Each turn, a player can decide to put in a coin of a certain value (dimes, quarters, nickels, or pennies), and/or to take some of the coins out of the well. In this case, a quarter can be retrieved by Eric from the well with the condition that he has to pay the total number of dimes first.  Then, Garrick puts in 8 pennies more than Cindy for their third turn. After that, Eric flips 2 quarters into the well, Garrick throws in an extra 1 penny, and Cindy throws in an extra 3 dimes. Finally, Ivy adds an extra 1 pent to the well. The total amount of pence now in the well is $23.65.  From the input above and the diagram, we can conclude that A.  Eric had to pay more dimes before taking out a quarter, B.  Garrick had to pay more pence", "answer": " 200"}

Rationales: 1: The person isn't using one piece of string _instead_ of two, they are only using one piece of string. 2: The person is using one piece of string to tie four things together, not two pieces of string. 3: Not using two pieces of string wouldn't be the point; rather, the question implies that using one piece of string is somehow favorable and it's asking why. 4: All the given choices are good reasons to use one piece of string where before we were told that the person wants to use two pieces to tie four things. 5: This choice implies that using one piece is somehow better than using two pieces. 6: Neither using one piece or two pieces will take longer to finish the job, as they are equal, and thus this choice doesn't make logical sense in the context.\n\n### Output: A: because it saves more material.\n\n### Answer Explanation:\n\nWe can immediately see that this is the only answer that makes sense in the given context.

Choices: A: 26 B: 2\nC: 12 D: 1 E: 260\nRationales:  1. The first step is to identify the phrase or unit of the question. In this case, the question states that the car travels 2 MPH hour, which means that the speed of the car remains constant and is independent of time. \n2. We can now calculate the distance traveled by the car in one hour. It is given that the speed of the vehicle is 2 MPH and that 1 hour has 60 minutes. \n3. Therefore, we can write the equation as: 2(60) = 26  and plug in the given values. \n4. By calculating we get: 26 = 26, showing that the given car will travel the exact same distance in one hour, no matter how long it takes to drive it. \n5. Next, we assume that the car continues its trip for 12 hours, so by plugging in the given values, we get: 2(12) = 26. \n6. Since 2(60)= 26, we can substitute 60 for 2 and get 120 = 26, which means that the car will travel 260 miles in 12 hours. 7. This is our answer.\nAnswer: D", "answer": " 96"}

{"text": "52\n\n#### Rationale:\n\nThe logic of the choice is to use logic to deduce the values of the variables. First, there are 5800 parking spots in total then the formula would be: n=5800. So we know there are 100 parking sposts in each level. But because there are more parking spots on Level~2 than on Level~1 and there are more parking spaces on the fourth level, we can't assume the number of open parking spaces is the same on each level and each level can have a different number of open spots at the end. So we would choose n=3000 after n~100. But because there are a total of one thousand parking spots. We can do a few more deductions to get the answer in the end. Because we know there total two more parking spots open in level~2 than in level~1 since it has 258 spots. And since we have 1500 parking spas open on the first level, n~3000. But we know that there are more parking space n than level~3 since it only has 285 open parking spots. So since level~1 and level~3 have more parking spaces, we can assume that they also have more open parking spaces and since the first level and third level have a different number of spots, we can assume that both have a different number of parking spaces open and this would be n~1000. But, since level~4 has the least open parking spots, it can be deduced that level 4 has 300 more parking spots than n~100 in total. So now that would be: n~1300. So that gives us 1300 parking spaots for level~1, 1000 parking sporots for level~2, and 185 for level~3, making the total open sposts 3000+185+1000=5235.", "answer": " 186"}

Finally, we applied the math.\n\n### Firstly, we will translate the expression into simple English.\n\nBrendan can cut grass for 8 yards per day, but using the lawnmower, it cuts 50% of the grass in the same time.\n\nSo Brendan can cut half a yard per day by hand with a lawnmower.\n\n### Let look at our analysis stage.\n\nTo help us solve this problem, we need to identify the problem type.\n\nSince we're dealing with the amount of time it takes to cut 8 yards, let's just say we can write this as time.  \n\nSo, the given information can be written as \n\nTime = 8 yards = 8 x 1 = 8 hours of grass cutting\nBy hand = 8 hours \nBy machine = 50% of time\n\nThen, we need to identify how to solve.\n\nWe know that the quantity that the question asks about is Brendan cutting one whole lawn over the course of a week. We also know that Brendan cuts this amount of grass by hand, and by using the lawn mower, he only takes half as long.  \n\nThe maths that we'll apply here is basic algebra, specifically \"Subtracting\", \"Multiply\" and \"Divide\".\n\nIf brendan cuts 8 yards by hand and cuts 8 x 50% = 4 yards using the lawn mover, the answer is:  \n2 x (4 + 4)\n\nAnd this is because there are two people and 4 yards total over time. If one person takes twice as long as the other", "answer": " 84"}

Lots of math. Or if he bought a bike that costed $500 and returned the $3000 tv\n\n#### Rationales:\nThe TV cost $700. So $700- 3000 = -2300 left for James.  The bike cost $500, so the 2 bikes he bought were $1000 left for him. He then decides to sell his unused bike for 80% and sell it for $200: 2700 - 3000  = -300. So now James has -4600 left.   The total of all this is: -4600 - -700 + 200 + 600 =- 850. So his total purchase price is 2150, and his return price is -1800, so his total loss is 3550.

{"text": "12\n\n### Instructions: 1. Let\u2019s begin the logic by dividing the numbers in the problem into smaller manageable numbers. Start by dividing John\u2019s weekly writing schedule of three stories by 4, which equates to 75 stories in a week. Now that we have that number, let\u2019s figure out how many novels John writes per year and divide that number by 54, that is 22 novels per year. Using the same format, we can now divide John\u2019s short stories into 3,000, which equates to around 66,670 pages. Now, we have a few different numbers, so it\u2019s time to bring them all into one place. 2. Let\u2019s divide 66670 by 50, and we are left with 1333.6 novels. Lastly, let\u2019s find out how many sheets John requires in a year on average, which is 7,500. We know that each page has two side\u2019s, and John needs to write 1333 novels, which amounts to 8 of those novels (7500 divided by 1333). So John needs about 8 reams of paper. By this logic, the answer is 8 reams, however, this was based on the assumption that each short story was 50 pages, but in this case, it only consists of 2. \n\n### Instructtion: 2\nIf your teacher leaves an assignment with you, but she wants it by Sunday, what time do you have to turn it in?\n\n### Instution: 80% of 8 hours\n\n### Intructiton: 3\nSay Sara\u2019s teacher gives her an exam on Friday afternoon in which she wants each student to answer two questions.

The question refers to a 'person' who is 'typically awake at night'.\n3. If it were referring to a single person, then the question would be asking how many hours they are typically awake at night.\n4 If it were referring to two people, then we would be asked how many hours both of them are awake at night. \n5. These options, therefore, indicate that the question refers to a collective 'person' which indicates to an abstract concept, like a nation or culture.\n6. Based on this, the most appropriate answer would be C: 5 because it indicates how many hours on average, a person is awake at night.

We are given a scenario where a baker sells packs of cupcakes each with different quantities.\n2. We are asked to find out how many other packages of cupcakes the baker must sell to Jean to provide 100 cupcakes to orphanage.\n2. The number of cupcake packs the baker must sell depends on the number of 10 cupcake packs Jean will have.\n3. If the baker has a total of four packs, so Jean will have 4 of 10 cup cake packs.\n4. We also know that each one pack is equal to 10 cup cakes and since there 100 children we need to serve, we can conclude that each child receives one package.\n5. Hence, to serve 100 children, Jean needs x 4 packs of cupcats.\n6.

{"text": "To understand the question, we need to first figure out what the cost of $0.85 per day in electricity means in the context of the question. \n\nBased on this, we notice that Kurt used to spend $0.85 in electricity in a day on his old refrigerator.  Assuming this is the same amount, he was spending before, he would spend the same amount, $0.85, in a 30 day month on the new refrigerator.\n\nA quick calculation using the inverse of $0.80 in a day results in $37.5 in a month, and $112.5 a year. That's an annual saving of $26.5 for a single refrigerator each month just by replacing it and upgrading to a more efficient refrigerator.

{"text": "Let's first examine the original question so that we can better understand the situation. It says that there are six more white birds in the cage than there are grey birds. It then implies that there is a total of ten birds in the cage \u2013 five white and five grey.\nNext, it says that after ten minutes, half the birds were freed and flew away. This means that after ten minutes the original five white birds and five grey birds in the cages flew away. So at that point in time, there would only be one white bird and one grey bird in the cage that is still a captive.\n\n### Now, let's look at the three options that have been listed for us: \n\n### Option A) After 10 minutes, the total number of birds left alive is 9.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's first look at the options that were left for us. Our first option is A, which states that after 10 minutes, there are 9 birds left alive. This could be interpreted in two ways. If the 6 white birds were kept in, then we can assume there is only one remaining white bird and one grey, since only 10 birds were initially left alive. Since there were originally 5 white and 5 grey birds, this leaves us with 6 white birds to make up the 7 that are kept, and 9 grey birds to make up the original 10 birds.\n\nAnother way to explain this would be to account for the 6 original white birds. If we assume that there were 6 white birds in the cages, then in addition to the original 10, 6 more are to be brought into the cage to make it equal to the 6 white birds that are currently held captive. This would be 5 more white birds after the 10 remaining in the cage have flown away, and then 1 more to equal up for the 6 birds that are not there anymore. \n\n### Our second option is B, which states that after ten minutes there are 5 white and 4 grey captured birds remaining.\n\nThis makes sense as it states that in the original situation there were 5 white and 10 grey remaining. After the 10 flew away, there were then 5 white and 9 grey remaining, which is accurate. \n\n## Response", "answer": " 66"}

First of all, it is good to note that the answer provided in the question is 0 because a value that is equal to zero is the most accurate answer to this question.\n\n3. Now, we can look at the numbers given:\n\n14 stone statues + 42 wooden statutes equaling to 56 overall\n\nAverage cost(income) of each statue is $26\n\nAverage cost of each statue is $40.30\n\nTheodore pays 5% in taxes\n\nThis means every month, Theodore only keeps 95% of his earnings which is his average earnings. This is because there are 4% of taxes that are imposed each month.\n\nSo to simplify things in our answer to the above question, we can deduct 4% of the total cost of his total earnings.\n\nInput: Rory can craft 12 stone statues and 38 wooden statues every month and his stone statue costs $23 and his wood statue costs $7.

{"text": "It will take 36 minutes to fill Lydia's pool.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe total volume of the pool is 60 gallons.  \n\nIn one minute, the pool loses one gallon of water through leakage, so after one minute, the pool's volume is 59 gallons.  Therefore, the total volume of water is (60 Gallons) - (59 Gallons) = 1 gallon.\n\nThe pool fills at the rate of 2 gallons per minute using the garden hose.  We can see that the pool will take 2 minutes to fill if it had no leakage, since the pool will fill to 2-minute increments.\n\nThe pool loses 0.1 gallon per minute of leakage.  To calculate how long 0.1 gallong will take to fill, we use the formula time = (1-1.65/ leakage gallons/ minute) x 2 minutes.\n\nTherefore the time for leakage is 2 x (1-1.5/ 0.1) = 0.5 minutes.\n\nThere are 60 (gallons) - 59 (gallons after one minute) = 1 (gallons) in the pool in a time of 0.1 (minutes).  Subtracting 0.1 minutes for leakage, there are still 0.9 gallons in the pool after 0.1 minute. Therefore, the pool will take 0.9 minutes to fill. \n\nHowever, if we do not multiply the number (of gallons after leakage begins) by the number (in minutes leakage takes), it will give us a large number. This large number can be rewritten to (1 gal x 3 minutes) = 3 gallons.\n\nThere is (60 gallons) - (3 gal) = 57 gallons left to fill after 3 minutes; and (57 gallons) - (0.1 gal) = 56.9 gallons left to fill in 3 minutes.\n\nThe pool volume is 60 gallonds.\n\nThe pool is filled at the rate of 60 gallons - (56.9 gallonds) = 3 gallon per minute.", "answer": " 40"}

This is important because, in the context of a question like this, it becomes necessary to determine whether the first statement refers to an animal or a non-animal entity. \n2. However, since the question refers to 'whales', we can assume that the question is referring to all kinds of animals and not just whales. \n3. Statement 2 refers to the behaviour of animals which is generally assumed to be affected by their ability to sense certain conditions like loudness.\n4. It says \"increase the loudness so that animals may be alerted\", this means that the loudness should be increased so that animals are sensitized.\n5.

The second cat meowed at twice the frequency of the first cat which means it meowed every minute. \n3. The third cat meowed at a rate that was one-third of the frequency of the second which meant it meowed at 30-second intervals.\n\n#### Meow total for each cat in a minute\n1. The first kitty meowed three times in each minute.\n2. So we have 3 meows in a minute for the first cat.\n3. The other two meowed twice and thrice as more as the first cat.\n4. It means that the second cat meowed 2 * 3 = 6 times each minute.\n5. And the third cat meows 3 * 2 = 6 times every minute.\n6.

We have to evaluate the word \"scores\" and this involves analyzing the context of the sentence with this information.\n\nHaving just said that, James scored 4 touchdown passes, the question then asks how many points does the player score per game.\n\nFirstly, there are two types of scores - there is the total of points that James scores each game and then there is the total points scored per game.\n\nWhen we say that he scores 4 touchdown pass per game, we are referring to the total points during the season. We are not saying that every game of the season James scores 4 touchdownd pass.\n\nWe can conclude that James scores, on average each game: 4 touchdown passes + 2 point conversions. This adds up to a total of 6 points per game.\n\nWe break down the points scored during the season: 15 game games times 6 points per game equals 90 points scored each season.\n\nThe question is how many points does James beat the old record - James scored for an extra 300 points, meaning he beat the old record by 300 points.", "answer": " 72"}

{"text": "A: 25 per minute\n\n### Rationale: The first step in answering this question would be to determine the amount of hot dogs that Lisa would need to eat per minute in order to at least tie Joeny Chestnut's world record.  \n\nFirstly, we know that Lisa has eaten 40 hotdogs as of the halfway point, so she has eaten a total of 70 hotdogs over the 10-minute period. This implies that she's eating 7 hotdogs every minute. \n\nNow we need to determine how many hotdogs per minute Chestnut ate to set the record. According to the question, \u201cJoey Chestnut set the record of eating 60 hot dogs in 10 minutes with 9 minutes and 25 seconds left on the clock.\u201d\n\nThis means that Chestnut set the world record after eating 60/10 or 6 hotdogs every minute, leaving him with 9 minutes and only 25 seconds to spare.\n\nWith this information in mind, we can now answer Lisa's question by determining how many hot dogs she needs to eat in order to at least match Chestnut's previous record of 60 hot dogs. If we know that she currently eats 70, how many more does she need to eat now? The answer is just 10. This means that she would need to eat 10 hotdogs more than what she's currently eating which is 7 each minute. Hence 7+10 = 17 per minute\n\nTo summarize, given that Lisa has currently eaten 40 and is eating 7 per minute, she would need to eat a total of 17 hotdogs per minute (7+10) in order to tie Chestnut's existing world record.\n\n### Input : In a particular city 2 of every 5 people speak German and 1 of every 15 people speak French.

{"text": "$2\n\n### Demostration:Input: Andy and Bob went to the cafeteria to purchase snacks. Bob bought two sandwiches and a fruit drink for $4, whereas Andy also bought a can of sode and two hamburges for $7. Who pays more?\nRationales: This question presents us with some information about what each person bought and how much they paid. From this, we can analyze the data to determine who paid more. \n1. Firstly, we observe that Bob spent $4 on his purchase and Andy spent $7 on his purchase, so it is evident that Bob spent less overall. \n2. Considering the individual items bought by each person, we notice that they both spent $1 on their drinks, $2 on their hamburgers, and $3 on their sandwiches. \n3. The canned drinks they bought cost $1 apiece, while the sandwiches and hamburgers cost $2 and $3, respectively, which means that Andy spent more on his meal. \n4. However, it is important to note that the soda can still counts towards both transactions, so even if Bob paid $1 more for a canned drink he still purchased, the net cost of his meal is $1 less. \n5. Ultimately, it can be concluded that Andy paid more for his meal. 4. When we apply the same logic to the given question, we can conclude that Bobby paid less for the two sandwiches and the fruit drink. \n5. The cost for Andy's meal is $6, as he paid $2 for each hamburger. \n6. The drinks he bought each cost $1, so that is equivalent to $2. \n7. The two sandwiches he purchased cost $6, which adds up to $8. \n8. With the soda, the meal for Andy costs $10. \n9. Meanwhile, the meal purchased by Bob only costs $6. \n10. Hence, Bobby obviously pays less.\n\nAnswer: B: Bobby paid less.\n\n### Input If the value of one dollar is $1.20 3 years ago, how much would $1 be worth today?\n\n### Instructions:A.

This answer was rated as the answer with no mistakes.\n\nAnswer: \nThe two choices I have picked are $3000 and $-500\nIn order to get the correct answer we need to do the calculation as follows: $(Hansels original pay check was 30000). If there was a 10% increase than that it would be 33000 since 10% of $30000 is $3000.\nSimilarly if Gretel had a 10% increament in this case it would be $33000. Now to calculate for Gretel lets assume the increment for her as 10%. her original paycheck would be $3000 which would now become $3300 which comes to $3000 more than her old increment, which is why the answer is $300.\nHansel's new paycheck of $36000 is more that Gretels new paycheck of $40500 so we should choose the second option as the correct one.\nSince the question is about calculating the salary of Hansel and Gretal and therefor in order to do so we would need to figure out the salary of the employees based on the increment so we need to have a way to calculate that.

{"text": "Rick purchased cheese blocks that he broke into servings. He ate 5 servings before running out of cheese. This is 5/16 of the total calories in a block. The blocks have a total of 110 cals. We have to subtract to solve this. I will explain why below.\n\n### Rationales:I understand the question, but I don't think a lot of people will read this far to learn this strategy. \nEven though this wasn't asked in the real exam, I'm going to explain the reasoning just in case.\n\nThe choice is B, which states that Rick buys a block that has 16 servings, and then he eats 5 servings. Based on that, he would have eaten 5/16ths of a block of cheese, which means that he's eaten 1/3rd of one.  \n\nSince each block contains 110 cal. and each serving is 16 times the size of one block (16/110), we can say that Rick would have eaten 16/3 of the block, meaning that there would still be 16/3 or 54/3 of the block remaining.  \n\nSince we have only accounted for the servings Rick ate (out of total servings in the block), that would leave 16/6 of the block - 5/6, or 0.83 of a serving, remaining.  Remember: Rick ate 5 servinsg, leaving 0.83 remaining.  There must be 0.17 in the block from the original question, since we already ate all of our servings!\n\n### Note:The choice is correct if you do the calculation wrong of how much Rick has left.\nIt also works if you miscalculate by leaving 0.14 servings of cheese left (assuming he leaves one to eat later).", "answer": " 1210"}

How many empty seats will there be at the first stop? Choices:   One A: Eight B: Four C: Seven D: Two E: None\nRationales:\n1. There are 11 rows after 58 seats in the first scenario. So each row will have 5 seats. After 5 seats, the remaining seats will be 1 seat(for 5th row). If the seats are arranged in each row in sequence 1,2,3,4,5 then the empty seat will be row number 1.\n2.

After this the sister now has 8-1/8 = 7. The sister has now lost 1/7 of her 7 diaries. So now she has 7-1/7 = 6. This sequence is a geometric sequence where the two remaining sequential values would be 1/2 which gets divided by 2 (1/2/2).

{"text": ">$11.80\n\n### Justification:\n\nDue to the question worded, we're looking for the amount of money Jay and Gloria spend at the craft store.  This number must be calculated first and is equal to $51.00, the amount the store is charging per bag of flags (5 flags per bag for $1.05 per flag).\n\nThe statement \"If they wanted all of their guest to have a flag and also one flag each\" is written to assume 2 flags per customer.  However, 1 flag is not enough for each customer to have one.  The 5 flags in the bag are enough to give everyone in Jay's list of 22 people a flag and then 1 extra for each person. \n\nTo figure out how many flags Gloria gave out, we multiply her list of 36 people by 2.  Gloria gave out 66 flags (36 x 2), which is equal to 16 flags less than what Jay gave.\n\nThen to figure out how many flags Jay gave out, we take 2 from the 60 flags in the bag and subtract it from 58 and add an extra flag for everyone in Gloria's list to get 10 flags less than what Gloria gave out.  \n\nWe can find 10 by subtracting the two from $58.95 and adding an extra flag for everyone to make it to $58.90.\n\nBy subtracting 10 less from what Gloria gave, we can figure out how many flags were left.  And by finding the amount left and knowing the amount the store is selling, we know that Jay and Gloria paid $11.80 at the store.\n\nAnswers that are acceptable have a different approach and still get to the correct answer (or nearly similar):\n>$11\n\nAnswer: A: 11\n\nAnswer 10: B\n\nAnswer 11: 12\n\nBased on the example answers, Jay was the first one to fill the bag up to $50, then he stopped and that's how he spent a total of $11.\n\n### Input : If you're on the road, where will you see this?\n\n### Answer: C", "answer": " 12"}

This makes it 4 bags of gravel per truck and 8 bags of gravel each mile.\n* On the first day, the company paves 4 miles of road which is 4 bags per truck, so 16 miles is 4 bags of trucks or 12. \n* On the second day, the company paved 1 mile less than double that, which means the company took 3 truckloads to pave 4 miles, so now the company took 4 bags of pitch per truck for 3 truckloads. So now we have 16 bags of pitch, which we can subtract from the 48 bags of pitch to get 32 bags of pitch\n* How many barrels it takes is how much each truck loads, 5 more than 2 bags of pitch = barrel. So on the third day it takes 16 barrels of pitch.\n\n### Sample answer:\n\n### Input A: They use a mixture of what to make the asphalter to pave the road\n### Rationale:\n* From what the question states, we know the company is paving a 16-mile-long road. \n* We also know that this road uses a special mixture to make the asphault. This would be \"pitch\" since the road is named a \"roadwork company.\" \n* This tells us that the road is going to use a mixture of pitch mixed in with gravel to pave the road using trucks for the paving. \n* This mix has two bags of grain, which is the same as 4 bags of asphalter.

If he has not won any bid for some time, he will have to play his bid aggressively. \nOn the other hand, if he is in a winning zone, he is likely to play it cool.\n\nSo, he will first be willing to spend a maximum bid within the range of his previous bids, in an effort to clinch the bid by the highest amount that he can afford.\n\nSecondly, he will only be willing to play at least double his last bid when he gains the confidence that he will win the bid from the beginning of the bidding session with one last aggressive play.\n\nHe will first be willing to play the bid at the current amount of his last bid, or slightly more if he thinks that the contract, when gained, will be profitable.\n\nSo, when he cannot be sure of his winning position, he will play conservatively, in order to be on the safe side.\n\nHence, the first option, i.e. option A, is the best choice.

{"text": "Cherry has finished reading 80 pages and Rene and Lulu have finished reading a combined total of 123 pages.\n\n### Rationales:  When 3 people spend a sum of time doing the same thing, their collective progress will be determined by:\n1. The individual speed of each person.\n2. The amount of time they spend working/doing the thing.\n\nBecause each person spends an equal amount of time working, the collective progress of each person must be 33 pages (one page each). However:\n1. We see that  Rene read 30 pages per hour but was slower than Cherry and Lulu, who each read 27 pages per hour.\n2. We see that  Cherry had finished 80 pages and Lulu + Rene had finished a combined total of 53 pages. \n\nThis means that in the time that they have been working for, Rene and Lulu together have read 63 pages, which means that Rene is 33 pages behind Cherry in their individual attempts to read. \n\nHowever, Rene is reading 30 pages per 60 minutes, while Cherry is reading 27 pages per 60 min, so this means that in the time they have been working, Rene has read a total of 120 pages. \n\nWe assume that Cherry has read all 25 pages of her 60 minute time period. \n\nThis leaves the combined total of 33 pages that should be finished for them to have been reading 240 min, which means that Renne and Lulu have finished an additional 93 pages in addition to Cherry's 80. So for their total they have finished 173 pages. \nHowever, as Rene had been working to read 30 pages an hour we must subtract 30 from our final number so that it can be confirmed. \n\n93*30 = 2790/027 = 106\n\n173-106 = 67 pages, which is confirmed by the text that Rene and Lulu finished 123 pages together.\n\n### Response - Option 1:\n\n### The question asks how many pages have they each finished reading for 24", "answer": " 328"}

Since, there is no mention of the exact time of the day, we can understand that it's most likely even during the daytime.\n2. Considering the choices, all the options but E can be possible throughout the day.\n3. Choices B and C are a sunny day, and that's not very close to the rain.\n4.

B: green sky may imply a hazy day but it can also show that the rain is over, and this might be true too.\n8. C: white sky could be both a sunny or a raining day but is more probably sunny and that's not what the sentence asked.\n\nTherefore, the choice that aligns with the given sentence and suits the context is B: green sky.

{"text": "$_________\n\n### Demand Response:\nThe cost of everything is $750. The first two costs are fixed, but the last one is not. In the last cost, John got discounted for paying in advance. Had he choose to pay later, the rate would have been higher. The price for the instrument is $500, and the lessons are $40 per lessons, which amounts to $800. In total, John spent $1,600. The discounted price is $800, implying that John's final cost was reduced by $800, resulting in an overall savings of $800.\n\n### Rationale:\nConsidering the options for \"what did everything cost\", the correct answer should be a figure.  To answer the question correctly, we need to understand how each of the options may be applied.\n\n#### Option A: $650\n\nIf we choose \"Option A\" as the final cost, it would mean that the overall cost of everything did not change after John received the discount.  To understand how this would work, we need to look at each of the items individually to see if this is actually the case.\n\nWhen we say \"he bought a piano\", \"a piano\" is a fixed cost, which means that it remains the same regardless of when John purchases it. Therefore, for this part of the cost, we get Option A.\n\nSimilarly, hiring a teacher for 2 hours is also fixed, so there is no change here. Hence, option A remains suitable for the initial cost as well. \n\nHowever, when we see John getting a 25 percent discount, it means his total cost will decrease if he pays earlier than expected.  This shows that the discount is given at the end rather than having it applied to every lesson throughout the payment duration.  Therefore, the final cost of everything must be Option D.\n\n#### Option B: $475\n\nIf we pick option B as the final cost, this means that John's discount has been applied to the lessons he purchased, but not to the purchase price of the instrument.  However, this is impossible because at the moment John buys the instrument, he has already paid the full price, so the 25% disc is already applied to his purchase.", "answer": " 1100"}

The first two choices, B: Living room and B: Kitchen, can be eliminated because they are part of a house but there is no information in the question that specifies a specific house is being referred to.\n4. Therefore the choices left are D: garage and D: room.\n5. In this context, a garage indicates that this house is a single-family residence.\n6. Hence, the most appropriate answer would be D: 'room'.

The question asks what is common to all three types of art, i.e. painting, carving, etc.\n2. The given options have been chosen in such a way that only one of them fits with the correct answer, while the others do not at all make sense in the context of art.\n3. Considering the answer choice as a whole, \"paint brushes\" can be eliminated as there is no specific mention of paint brushes being common to all types of art.\n4. Option \"B: colors\" can be eliminated since it is not specific to art and does not include carving.\n5. Option \"A: tools\" can be eliminated because art is considered to be a form of self-expression and not something that requires tools.\n6. Therefore the one choice that fits is option \"B: brushes\"\nAnswer: B: brushes", "answer": " 22"}

{"text": "**The best answer is: A. 330 pages.**\n\n1. Rationales: \n2. The question asks how many pages Yasna needs to read each day to finish both of her books in two weeks.  \n3. From the information given, we know that the first book is 181 pages long, and the second is 109 pages.  \n4. To complete both books in two weeks, Yasna needs to divide the total number of pages she needs to read by 14 (the number of days in the two-week period).  \n5. Based on that calculation, the final number will always be a positive whole number. \n6. If Yasna can read a fixed number of pages each day, for example, 100-pages, she can read all 181 pages of the first book in three days, leaving just 109 pages of the second book to be read before the end of the two weeks.\n7. If she can read a fixed number pages each day, and she finishes that fixed number at the end of the first week, she will only have one week left to finish the two books. \n8. If Yasna had to read 231 pages, she would finish the first book in two days, leaving only 109 pages left for the second book, which she could finish on the last day of the two weeks.  \n9. And so, we see that if she completes a fixed number of pages every single day, she can always finish the second book before the end of the first two weeks. \n10. Now, the same can be said for dividing the number of pages she has to read by 12, 11, and so on (the amount of pages left until she finishes them all). No matter what the number Yasna divides by, if she reads the same amount of pages each day, she can always read them all in two weeks.\n11. So, the correct answer is \"A. 330.\" If she reads 181 pages on day one, 109 on day two, and so on, all the way to 109 on the last day, she will have finished both books. \n\n### Input and answer:  \n\nI recently made ___ with", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "4.0 miles per hour\n\n### Rationale:Let's break the calculations down. The hiking time = 6 hours (5:30 = 6 PM, so 6x1.5 would be 9 PM). \n360 degrees/24 = 15 degrees per minute. The elevation change is 5.5 ft per second (30 feet/minute).\n360 seconds/480 feet = 0.75 seconds.\nSo this can be added to the elevation changes. With 15\u00b0 per minute there would be 1 degree every 6 seconds. \n60\u00b0 divided by 6 = 10\u00b0 in one part. 10\u00b0 x 6 = 60' hiking up and down the trail. \nSince 24 miles = 24 * 0.527 = 12.374 miles\nSo if she hiked 12.4 miles with 452 (feet + 6 ft/minute) elevation change, that would be a total climb of about 48 degrees per hour.\nSo average pace = 50 mi/h * 60min/h = 3000 mi/h. 3000 miles per hour /480 feet per minute = about 6 miles per minute. 6 mi/min * 60 min/h = 6 miles per hour.\nAnswer: 6 miles per hour\n\n\n### Input:\"E\" is not a vowel! \"E\" is a vowel, and it's silent.\"\n\n### Response:\"E\" is not an vowel?\n\n### Demostration:\nThe statement implies that the first person is making an issue out of something irrelevant.

Therefore, Jacob has 24 less pairs of shoes that Edward has.\n\nFinally, Brian has 22 more more pairs of shoes hat Edward has, which is also 24 more pairs that Jacob has. Therefore, we know that Jacob's total number of pairs of shoeshath is 24+22=46.\n\nAfter adding the two together, Edward and Brian have 46+22=68 pairs of shoes.

The rollercoaster has 7 cars and each car can seat two people.\nRationales: After setting up the input and output for this expression, the next step is to understand the context and evaluate the choices. As the name suggests, rollercoasters can be considered to be a source of entertainment at an amusement park, where people may be excited to ride them and stand in line for their turn.\nWe see that the number of people in line - 84 must be evenly divisible by the number of cars on the ride, which could be anywhere between 4 and 14, i.e. from 4 to 7. Similarly, the number of people divided by the number of cars - is always a number of 2 (even).\nBased on these calculations and the context, as it seems reasonable to assume that the rollercoaster's cars can only carry up to 2 times of people, then we can infer that count would likely be equal to one of the numbers that fall within that range.\nWe will pick the next lowest even number above 84, which is 84.\nSince, 84/7 = 12 times rounding down because each car can hold 8 people, we will use the next smallest number within that time range - 11 as it will round up as 11 times to 8.\nTherefore, we conclude that the guess would be 4. But after taking the input value, 84, the output cannot be correct because according to the given context, the output must be equal to 2 times the input. Therefore, we will guess 6 as our second closest answer to test.\nIf this is not the answer, we may have to assume a higher number and test more options to see what would be closer", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "The answer to the given question is 768 gallons.\n\n\n### Key Points\n1. First, identify the information given. The most important information is the numbers in the problem, (the question gives us all the numbers needed to solve), and the numbers we will be subtracting.\n2. Divide the problem into two parts to work on them individually. Create an equation based on the numbers in the paragraph. \n3. Next, determine which steps you will be subtracting to work toward the answer. Each subtraction step is determined by using one of the four rules of arithmetic operations. The 4 rules are:\n - Addition is commutative, so the order of the addends does not matter. ( 3 + 6 = 3 + 6, because addition is commutative )\n - Subtraction is not commutative, so the answer to 25 \u2013 14 is different from 14 \u2013 25, which is why the order in which we solve subtraction problems matters. Subtraction is not a distributive property, so we need to solve the problem separately.\n - Multiplication is not commutative, which is why the answer for 3 \u00d7 7 is not the same as 7 \u00d7 3.\n - Division is not commutative, the answer for 3 \u00f7 9 is 34/9, which is not equal to 9 \u00f734. \n4. If there are any other information, such as a key word in the problem like \"plane\", it would mean that we should not use that information. As with most problem solving word games, you must not use any information that is not stated. The words that you must not use do not appear in the question.\n\n## Participate\n\nTo participate in a contest, you will be required to register (free of charge) on the [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) website if you don't have an account already or login with your existing account.\n\n**Once you are logged in**, click **here** (for CodeChef October Long Challenge 2021) to participate in the challenge.

{"text": "A model rocket is similar to a real one.  In both the model and the real one, a fuel tank is provided from which the fuel is ejected to make the rocket rise.\n\n### Solution: The difference between the two fuels provided is the quantity of the fuel contained in the fuel tank.  Let's imagine that there is a given amount of fuel that can be added into the model's fuel tank, so to have the rocket fly for 500 ft, John had to add the said amount of fuel.  Now, to reach the height of 1000 ft in the second rocket, John had to either add twice the original quantity of fuel or he can place a fuel tank with twice the capacity of the model's fuel.\n\n### Given John builds a model with twice the capacity of fuel than the model and this is done in the same manner as for the model, the fuel tank can be provided with 2 times the amount of fuel that the model's fuel can hold, i.e, 2\u00d7500, which is equal to 1000.  Hence, the combined height of the model rocket with the capacity of double the original fuel and the second one with twice the original fuel's capacity is that 1000/2 = 500.

How far does he walk in 10 seconds?\n\n### Rationale: The above problem is a type of algebra problem that requires one to know how to find \"distance traveled in one hour\" or \"rate divided by time\". In this case the rates are: One kilometer per second or one hundred and seventy-two miles per hour, and one kilometer per ten seconds or one mile per hour.\n\n### Method:  We first determine the rates by using the given information. The man walks \"17.2 kilomters an hour\" (17.2 mi/h) or \"4.8km per ten seconds\"(4.8 miles per hour). \n\nThen we use those rates \n\nto determine \n\nthe man walks 17.2 mi per hour and 1/10th of that per 10 seconds or 172 mi per hour.\n\nThe amount of kilometers he walks in half an hour is 1/2 x 1 hour x 172 = 86 km. \n\nIn 5 minutes he would walk 4.8 km per kilometer rate x 4.8 min/10 secs x100=4.8kms/min rate.

The question asks if the item is $5 more expensive than the item that's \n50% off when the item is not on sale, and the item is equal to 25%. \n\n2. \"None\" is not a correct answer choice as it is not a logical option for a scenario. \n\n3.

The question asks:\n\n**_If she lost 20points, then how many rouns did she play?_**\n\n### Solution\n\nSo the question is how many rouns Jane played. To answer this, we have seen that there are 2 points for each round she won, and 10 points for each round she lost (total 110). We take 120 (winning score), and subtract 110 (losing score). This gives us 10, which is the number of rounds Jane played.", "answer": " 8"}

Assuming this is true, the same rule applies:\n\n- The printer is not working and he needs to get it to function, and\n- To do this, he must buy a black-and colorless cartridge that will fit the printer.\n\nAs such, the same rule applies here too, for the \"black-and colorless\" cartridge he needs to buy a \"black-and coloreless\" cartridge, as per the context of the printer.\n\nHowever, at this point we also must understand that it is the printer to which he is going to add the cartridges, and that all of the options to purchase said cartridges, come in sets of 5.\n\nIn light of this information, there are two possible scenarios with regards to Jerry's budget:\n\n- If Jerry buys one of the pre-made 5-cartridge packages and he only needs the three color cartridges, he can simply buy one $32 color cartridge and two $27 color cartridges.\n- If Jerry needs to buy two black-and-white and three color cartridgess he needs to buy nine cartridges in all: a black-and-wite cartridge, a black-and-whit cartridge, and six color cartridges. (Though if Jerry only ever needs to buy a black and white cartridge, then his budget is effectively the same regardless of what he decides to do: He will simply only need to buy enough supplies to complete the set of five that comes with the printer.

{"text": "Kyle threw the ball twice as far as Parker so he beat Parker at football tryouts.\n\n### Rationales:\n* Considering each option: For the correct response to be \u2018C\u2019, Kyle had to have thrown the ball more than twice the distance that Parker threw it.\n* Looking at the choices, Grant threw the ball 4 times as far as Parker meaning that Parker threw the ball 4 yards. If 4 is 25% of 16, then 16 must be divisible by 4 and we know Parker threw the ball 8 yards.\n* So the next step is to use 25% of another amount to figure out how much farther than Parker Kyle threw the ball; this is 2 times 25%.\n* To figure out 25% of a number, you take 25% and divide it into 100 because there are 100 cents in a dollar. So 25% of $1 is $0.25 and 25% of Kyle\u2019s throw was 25% of what Kyle\u2019s throw is and we know that\u2019s $0.33 so 25% of Parker\u2019s throw (or Parker\u2019s distance in yards) is $0.50. \n* Grant threw the ball 8 times farther than Parker so Grant\u2019s throw was 8$ and Kyle\u2019s was 0.50.\n* Since Kyle\u2019s throw (50 cents) is less than Parker\u2019s throw ($0.50), this means Kyle didn\u2019t throw the ball twice as far. \n* So since Kyle didn\u2019t beat Parker at football try outs, the correct response cannot be 'C'.\n* The only other response that could be the correct response is 'B' because Grant threw the ball twice as much as Parker.\n* Therefore the correct response to this question is \u2018B\u2019.", "answer": " 24"}

So 9-24= 66 feet, which is the distance the unicorns will walk side-by-side during their journey.\n\n### Since 66 feet is the answer, we can write this formula (x-A, where x is the distance that each unicorn moves, and A is the distance in which they're walking), 66=(x-A), (x/ 4)^2, + (4). If we solve this equation, we find that the answer is x/ 4= 19 (their path is 19 feet apart).\n\n### So, we know that the answer is 9 flowers because 19 flowers = 19 times 4 = 76 flowers.\n\n### 9+ 19 + 76 = 95, which is the number of flowers blooming.\n\nAnswer: 95\n\n### This question type can also be used in the classroom to show students how to use their logic skills to solve simple problems like this:\n\n## Instruction:Answer the question below.\n\n## #1.

The year in question was 1966 when food prices were different than the next year in 1967.\n2. The year in which prices were different from the next year was 2018 which has a discount of 4%. \n3. This means that 100 items in 1965 were 39 years ago from 2018.\n4. If you use a debit to purchase food at the same restaurant in 1968 when prices are different from the next year is 2018, you get 100 for 4% of the total price. \n5.

Let's begin with the first choice, option A, which refers to the situation when one number is less than three and greater than 5, while the other is more than 5. Neither of these options is an appropriate choice as neither of these represents a situation where both numbers add up to 1 1.\n2. Option B specifies that the answer is a scenario where the two numbers are both greater than 4; this is not correct either, as it is not possible that two numbers can both be greater than 4 and add up to just 11.\n3. Option C refers to the case where the first number is smaller than 4 and the second number is larger than 8, but this situation does not meet the criteria of finding two numbers that add up 11, where either number can be less than 4 or more than 8.\n4. Option D involves two integers that sum to 10 and are both greater than or equal to 3, but both of these values do not refer to two individual numbers that add up to exactly 11 between 0 and 10.\n5.

E: The bouncy ball will continue moving forwards.\nRationales: The question asks what happens to a bouncy ball that leaves the garden and doesn't specify where the ball ends up. \n\nThe balls are likely to return to the garden, or at least they may have the potential to return to the garden. Balls may bounce back and forth or return in an entirely different direction.\n\nA: this is a very vague question, and in most cases the ball will not be flying across the sky but may simply bounce.\n\nB: although the ball may eventually drop out of the garden, it wouldn't drop straight onto the ground but would likely bounce first as with any object.\n\nC: we don't need to assume that the ball will turn into a rock and land on the ground, though it may simply bounce. It is possible that it may even change direction.\n\nD: as given in the question, the ball is said to be rolling out of the garden and therefore it will eventually come back.\n\nE: this seems to be the most likely scenario as a ball may simply roll on the ground and be stationary until it is eventually disturbed.\n\nAnswer: E: The bouncing ball will continue moving forewards as given in the question the ball is said to roll out of the garden and it may not be bouncing or changing in any other way.\n\n#### Input:If you were to get lost in the snow, where might you look for shelter?

{"text": "Based on the context of the problem, it is clear that Krystian works in a library and borrows books on daily basis. We understand from the question that he borrows an average of ___ books every day. The library is open from Monday-Friday which means that Krystian borrows books on the whole 5 days of the week. Now, we need to identify what is being referred to as the \u201cDaily Average\u201d. In the question, it is mentioned that every Friday, his number of books borrowed are 40% higher which means Krystian borrower ___ books on the weekend (i.e. Friday + Saturday).

To find out what time the alarm goes off, we need to figure out which of the times given represent the alarm clock.\n2. The alarm is most commonly associated with being 'on' and 'going off'.\n3. All of these times are considered early, so the question does not imply we want to know what time it will be in the morning, but rather what hour on the AM clock it will be when it is on.\n4. By analyzing the times, we realize that the alarm clock may go off as early as 3:00, 4:00, 5:00, 7:00, or 7:30.\n5. The latter two are quite early, so it's possible that 3:00 or 4:00 is the time of the alarm.\n6. Therefore to find out what time the answer is, we can eliminate all the other incorrect choices.\n7.

Next, we have to deduct 10 mystery books to arrive at the answer. Deducting 10 mystery books gives us 15 mystery books. So we have the following equation 10 + 14 - 15 = 20.\n4.

We know Paddington has 4 more goats than Washington so: (40 + 4) = 44\n\n2. Paddington has 163 goats, so we add Paddington's goats to his 44 and we have (163 + 44) = 207\n\n3. That is because, \"Paddington has 140 more goats\" which means 207 is Paddingtons goats.\n4. Now we have to add the goats Washington has to Paddingtons goats: 163 + 140 = 127 goats.\n5. If we add 127 to Washington's goats, we get his total: 140 + 127 = 267\n\n6. To solve completely, we have to add 127 goat again to Paddingtons and 140 to Washington's again and we get a total goats of 400 goats.\n7.

{"text": "The correct answer is H.\n\n### Rationale: \nThe question asks for the amount of time the turtle needs to cross the finish line in order to tie with the hare. We know from the problem statement that the hare crosses the finish line first. \n\nThe two parts of the problem statement are the hare running at 10 feet per second and the turtle running at 1 foot per second.\n\nWe know that both speeds are linear, and that they have a different ratio - the hare moves 10 times as fast as the turtle.\n\nBecause of this, we can solve the problem using a proportion:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{x}{0.1} = 10 \\iff x = 1000\n\\end{equation}\n\nSolving for time, we get $t = 100\\ s$, which is equal to ten tenths (or 10) of a second. \n\n### Additional Notes: \n\nIt can be solved in a multitude of ways, including:\nIn the first part of the problem, they give us the hare starting at the 0-milers mark and the 0-miler being at the finish line (because both the hare and the turtle have not yet begun the race). We need to get the distance between when the turtle crosses the 0-miles marker to when the hare crosses. This is 0.2 miles. \n\nTheir speeds can be written as $\\frac{x - y}{x} = \\delta$. Given the 20-foot length of a mile, we can easily convert 0.2 miles into 20 feet. We have $\\frac{x - 0}{x} = \\frac{0.2}{x}$, so that $0.2x = 1$, so $x = 0.5$. \n\nBecause of the length of a mile we could get $x =.95$. \n\nWe can also find the total time of the race by multiplying the two speeds, so 10 x 7483.33 =.748333s.", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "Let answer choices include gallons, add another choice for quarts.\n\n### Submit: Choose the answer with the fewest gallons chosen.\n\n### Rationale:  This question consists of two parts in which an applicant is given a set of conditions and then asked to complete a calculation to find the final solution. \n\n### Demstration:\nInput Part 1:  The question asks how many gallons of water needed for multiple wash cycles. \nRationales:  1. As we know, there are two heavy washes and three regular washes. We also know that there is an extra laundry cycle per load of laundries after bleach is added. So, in total, we have the addition of four extra washes after bleach is added (as there are no light washes for those loads).\n2. The question then asks for the quantity of water required for the four extra washes. \n3. Considering the first wash, it contains 20 gallons per load (20 gallons/load of laundry x 20 loads/washes). So, the second four washes contain 20 gallons x 4 washes = 80 gallons.\n4. The total sum of all the washes equals (10 gallons/load x 25/loads) + 20 gallons/wash x 25 washes = 500 gallons + 5000 gallons = 5500 gallons.\n5. Adding in the water for the extra light wash brings the total to water used per laundry cycle to 5500 + 2 gallons = 5000 5500 5520 gallons.\n6. If the applicant had not included the light wash, the answer at the solution would be 5500, indicating that water of that amount is used per load. However, the added light wash has increased the use of water, and the amount of total water used is now 5520. \n\nInput Part 2: The question then asks for how many gallons of bleach are needed to add to those wash cycles.

{"text": "Total time = 44.5 minutes\\\n1. Let's start by analyzing the options B: 0 + C: 0.5 = 0.5, and E: 0 + 0 = 0.\n2. What we are actually looking for here is the difference of a number and zero, so subtracting the options does not show us the required result.\n3. If we subtract the given values from the sum of 0 + 0.5 + 6, we get 6 - 7, which is the same as 1.\n4. Adding 1 to both sides of the equal sign, we get 5 + 1 = 6.5. \n5. So, the combination of the time spent singing, practicing, and throwing temper tantrums is 6.5 minutes. \n6. Hence, The total combined amount of time that she spends practising, throwing tantrums and singing in the final performance will be 6.5 minutes more than 6 minutes.\n7. So the total time that she spends on all these activities will be 7 minutes, which can also be written as 1 minute + (3 minutes + 5 minutes) = 7 minutes.\n8. By using the expression that we get from the sum of 1 + 8, we can get 1 + 9 = 10. \n9. The total combined amount of practice, emotional temper tantrums, and performance time in minutes is 10 minutes.\n10.

Then we must get the angle in the form : 313,781*01^\n    - Using the angle formula : ( 36000/t ) * ( ( Breeze block - Man ) / ( Sun - Man ))\n    - ( 360^1) * ( ( Breeeze block - Man ) ^2 ) / ( Sun - Breeze Block ^2 )\n    - ( 01 ) * ( Breeeze Block - Man ) ^2 / ( ( Sunn - Man) * 01 )\n    - 01.575394664951663 * ( Breee eze Block - Man )", "answer": " 347"}

Response: \n\n**Step 1: Identify the relationship expressed as well as the relevant information from the question and the answer.**\n\nFirst we need to decide what the question actually asks. So we have 3 choices available to us:\n\nE: \"you can put whatever in this bagger you like.\"\nE: \"I just ask that you put them in the bag without looking.\"\nE: \"it would be fun to see how we can make breakfast for the day if we could mix the things together.\n\nFrom the three things, we can see that the context is the same for the first two, where the woman asks the boy what they can put in the bag without taking a look and the last one is different where the boy asks the woman to ask to her brother to put whatever they like in the bag. Then we identify that all three statements are asking about the ingredients that will be in the bag. \n\nNext we need to see what the information that is relevant for the answers. We know that if the answer doesn't satisfy the question, then the answer is wrong. If the answer satisfies the question, then the answers must belong to one another. \n\nSo, since the first question asked him to put what they can in the bag without taking look and the first statement is a fact, then that means the answer to the first question must be wrong and doesn't satisfy what the question asks.

For the remainder of the 22 days, the average daily rains was twice the amount observed in the first 11.\n\nStep 3: To find out the total rainfall during the month of November, we need to understand the type of data (rate vs total), and how the information is presented.\n\nStep 4: Now, step by step analysis for totals and averages is in order.\nThe rate is 11/8 = 1.375.\n\nMultiplying it by 4 gives 5.5, which is the total rains on the first 15th day.\n\nThen the rate is 15/22 x 5.5, giving a total 7.125.\n\nTherefore, the total for the first 15 day rainfall is, 5.5+ 7.12, which is 12.62 inches.\n\nStep 5: We can repeat this for the other 14 days.\n\nStep 6: Now, to find out the total rains for November, we add up the totals from both the 11 and the remaining 22 days:\n\nFirst 11: 12.6, remaining 22: 12.\n\nTherefore: 24.6\n\nStep 7: We can round to any accuracy that you wish.\n\nStep 8: Now to answer the question, we provide an organized structure which contains both the answer and the steps taken to reach the answer.\nThe question has a total number of 8 steps.\n\nExample:  I arrived on time.\n\nThe solution is: The first thing I do is:\n\nStep 1: I arrive on time.\n\nStep 1a: I arrive\n\nStep 1b: on time\n\nStep 8a: I arriv\n\nStep 8b", "answer": " 180"}

{"text": "If 10 + (3 x R) = 14, then R can only be 1.  But that would also mean the three stop lights were green and the man's ride would only take 14 minutes.\nRational:\n- The man is trying to decide between two paths, and they both start at the same intersection.\n- He decides to take the route with 3 stoplights - this is represented by R = 3, meaning that his journey will last 10 + (R x 3) minutes - that is, 10 + 9 = 19\n- As it's represented by 19, we know it's not a red light - he will reach his destination in 19 minutes.\n- The second route option doesn't have any stop lights and does take 14 minutes to complete - this is represented by B = 0 or R = 0\nRational:\nThe first part of the question asked us to find the value of the variable R. In the second part, the man is returning from this same route, and there is no change in time or travel, just a different starting point at some intersection.\nThe man started from that intersection, so R = 0 would simply mean the man is at the intersection and 14 minutes is how long the journey takes from there to his home. Since the only thing that changed was the intersection, and not the travel time or the stops, R = 0 is the only possibility.\n\n### Input : A bookstore owner is looking to fill shelf space with new releases in three categories: best sellers, mysteries, and science fiction.

Answer (C).\n\n#### Instruction: Increase the percentage of the guests who are friends by 13%.\n\n### Solution: 13% = 0.13 (we will convert this to a percentage in the next step), so when we multiply the original percentage (0.13 by 100) it is: 0.13 x 100 = 13% In this case: 13% + the original amount = 14.33% \n\n1.

Here this bookstore is selling both books because they are selling these books at a high price (TOP) and low price (ABC). So the revenue they are gaining is the combined sum of two book sales. \n\n### Rule of thumb:\nHere we just have to take this revenue and subtract the \"high-cost\" and add the \"low-cost\" to see how many more books of \"high-cost\" were sold. \n\n## Solution:\n![Screenshot 2022-09-06 at 17 32 52](img/screenshot-1.png)\n\n### Explanation:\n* The best-selling book is \"TOP\", and it costs $8.\n* The least-selling is \"ABC\", and it costs $23.  \nThere are more books of \"ABC\" that are sold as compared to the number of books of \"TOP\" that are sold.\n\nThen, to subtract the cost of a book, you simply need to take this number and multiply it by this number.  \nIf you take the total cost, and then subtract the total revenue, you will get the difference.\n\nThen, we multiply $23 by $3 to get the answer of $69. That means, we have to multiply the cost by 3 because there are 3 times more people who are being sold the book ABC than are being sold the book TOP.  \n\nSo the total revenue is $96, the $10 cost of \"TOP\" is $10. And then the \"ABC\" books which were sold are 3 times more.\n\nSo now, we have to subtract $10 and $69.

How many tires can he make for the car?\n\n### Demostration:Input data for a 12 in. car tire\n\n### Rationales:1.The answer to this question requires first finding the number of tires Roger can make, then multiplying that number of tires by the size of a 12 in tire.  So, starting with a 12 in car tire:  \n2.The first thing we must do is break down the tire measurement into its two parts, the diameter and the circumference.  The diameter is 12 inches, so its measurement is 1.25 feet, or 12.5 inches (rounding up).  The circumference is then 22.5 inches.  We want to make two dozen of these tires, so 22.5 divided by 2 is 11.25 inches.  This is equivalent to 11 circumferences.  The next step is to repeat this calculation for 12 inches as well (since we need to make 2 dozen of each).  Thus, we need to make 12 circumferences or, rearranging the equations, multiply 12 x 11 (since 12=24 and 11=1.25).  The result is over 135 inches of tire.  Next, we need to determine how many inches of tire our workstation can handle at once.  Since we have a 12 in bike tire that has 12.5 in circumference (or 12 and 1/2 inches precisely), let's find its diameter.  We can do this by taking its circumference and dividing by 2.  Multiplying 12 by 11, we have 12*112.5 inches.  12*11 equals 12.5, and 11*12.5 equals 137.5.  Subtracting 137.25 from 137. 5 we get 0.25 inches, which", "answer": " 12"}

Each team consists of 10 players. There are 4 teams, and each team has 10 players for a total of 40 players.\n2. Each player gets more than 1 pair. There is 1 captain and 9 players for each of the 4 teams. That means that every individual will receive more than 1 pair of shoes. In total, the pairs of shoes given to each player equals the number of players multiplied by 2 in this case. That is not taking into consideration the extras of 1 for the captains.\n3. The captains are given one extra pair of shoes. That is to say that each captain gets one extra pair of shoelaces on top of the one of each person that the captain represents.

{"text": "The given passage is given with the intent to present an analogy to the reader and lead them to the desired answer.  It goes about doing this by providing a detailed description of a situation in which it is known that the snowdrift is 34 inches deep.   The passage describes how the snowdrift melts and becomes deeper, and then it snowed again and it becomes deeper again.  This causes the reader to guess how deep the snowdrifts are at the end of the four days.  When reading the final sentence that stated that if the snowdrift was the given number of inches deep at the end, it also mentioned how deep it was at the beginning.  In this final sentence, it tells the reader that if the first day of snow added an additional 4 inches of snow in order to yield a total height of 34 inches, the initial snowdrifts were only a little bit smaller than the final snowdrift.  In this paragraph, the given information has no useful effect on the solution.  The initial snowdrift was smaller than the final snowdrifts at just about every point, and nothing within the given information states that this was not the case.  The answer should not reflect just a change in the amount of snow that fell, which is what the given information is focusing on.  This is because the passage is not just asking for the snow to melt, but for the passage to be a reasonable analogy of the situation that it describes.\n\n\n### Conclusion:If a person can swim laps in a pool in 2 minutes, what is the average speed of that person, in miles per minute, as he or she swims the full length of the pool?\n\n### Example Solution:\n\nGiven, a person can swim half the lap in 30 seconds. 1/4 of the full lap is equivalent to 3 minutes.

{"text": "A: 26 seconds\n\n### Rationale: \nThe question presents a scenario where a cheetah and a gazelle are both running in the same direction. The cheetah is running at a top speed of sixty miles per hour, and the gazelle is running at a top running speed of forty (40) miles per hour.\n\nThe given information is stated in a way that provides all the necessary information and can be applied to reach the required answer: the question states that one mile per hour is the equivalent of roughly 1 1/2 feet per second, and it also provides the distance (210 feet) between the two animals at the start of the race.\n\nUsing these parameters, we can calculate the required time for the cheetah to catch up with the gazelle. We know that the cheetah travels at sixty miles per hour and that one mile per hour equals roughly 1 13/16 feet per second. We can use the above information to calculate the required catch-up time as follows: 1.5 feet/1 13/ 16 feet per second = 2.28671 seconds per mile covered.\n\nMultiplying this by 210, the given total number of feet, we get 437.78 seconds.

{"text": "If Alex makes luxury dresses, they are certainly expensive items. \nThus, we can assume that he has enough money to spare without being worried about how much silk he would buy for his dresses. \n\nSilk, on the other hand, is a fabric known to be a little extravagant, and since Alex is a luxurious silk producer, it is reasonable to say that he buys all of his silk from a single supplier.\n\nWe further assume that this supplier doesn't have an unlimited supply of silk. \nThis supplier, being the one and only provider of silk to luxurious producers like Alex, is likely to take into account the fact that these producers will be making 5 meters of silky dresses. \nTherefore, the silk supplier is only likely to have enough silk stock to accommodate the amount of dresses that Alex can possibly make with his silk. \n\nGiven these assumptions, we are able to answer the question. \nWhen we analyze the choices given in the context of an affluent silk dress producer, we see that 400 is indeed the exact number that we are looking for. \n\n#### Rationale\nWe can analyze each other choice and eliminate the unsuitable options. \n1. Since Alex makes these dresses for other affluent people, the dresses he makes for himself will likely also be expensive and luxurious, so we can rule out Option A: 1. \n2. If the answer were Option B: 5, it would contradict Alex's choice to share them because he'd only be able to make 4. \n3. If the answer were option C: 40, it would contradict Alex sharing his silk with his friends because he would only need 30 for himself and his friends (including the ones he shared the silk with) would need 10 each, and thus Alex would not be able to make any silk dresses himself. And if it were D: 50, it would contradict the silk suppliers choice to sell the silk, resulting in the silk supplier only having 100 total silk in stock, which only 400 dresses could accommodate. \n4.

The goal is to get an equal amount of points on the left side of the screen as on the right.  I like to think that you should get more points on the left side because the \"4\" to the left is larger, therefore it's less likely to get caught. One point, two points, and so on.  A: I believe we should get fewer points on the left (not more, as our answer states), because this means that we are subtracting and so 1 sub in the left column would be 1 subtract the left column. Two subtraction in a row leaves you with the left number plus the right number, which is 4 and 3. Therefore that would mean 4+3=7\n#### B: I believe we should be getting a greater amount of points on the right (which is the opposite of the answer, as it states we should be getting more). This would mean 4 more subtraction, which leaves you with 4+3+3+3 = 13\n#### C: I also think more points should be on left, because of the 3, it's less prone to being caught because as you add more, the more likely it will be caught 1+2+3\n#### D: I think we should be getting less points on the left (opposite of the answer) because the 3 on the right is the greater number, so in a series of 4 subtractions, we have already established the correct answer. To the left, however, we must have more to go after the 4 which means the 3 on the left will have smaller subtractions, leaving us with (4) 3 (4) 3 = 9\n#### E: This may be unconventional, but I think we should be adding because they just said we should be getting fewer points from left to right.

To ask about the oven instead would suggest that one has some specific knowledge about the heating apparatus that is being used for cooking food in the kitchen, which is probably not the case when one is asking about the temperature in a kitchen.\n\nHowever, asking about the temperature in the kitchen could potentially be ambiguous since the kitchen is not just a place of cooking, but also an apartment. \n\nSo, when asking the chef for the information regarding the temperature in a kitchen, the word choice may seem ambiguous to the chef.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s unlikely that the chef would have precise information regarding the temperature of the kitchen since the temperature could vary based on the location of the kitchen within the house and factors such as the placement of windows, the strength of the heat source, etc.\n\n### Input:- When he was a professor, I knew him as a tall man.

{"text": "John jogged 3 miles when he ran alone and 4 miles when he was being pulled by his dog. This means that he jogged a total of 7 miles.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1.  First, we must note that John jogged at the same speed, regardless of what or who was dragging/pulling him. So, in this situation, there is no reason to adjust his speed or speed up.\n2.  John's dog weighs 100 pounds. This means that John's dog exerts 100*2 (pounds) of force, or 200 pounds, in order to pull John.\n3.  Secondly, each of John's runs lasted for 30 minutes. This means that during each of his runs, the dog exerts 200 pounds of force for the duration of the 30 minute run.\n4.  Thirdly, we must take into account that after 30 minutes of running, John goes back to running alone without his dog. \n5.  Therefore, the force that the dog exerts will no longer be present.\n6.  This means the dog no longer exerts the same amount of force (200 pounds) during his run alone, which impacts the distance John covers in his total time spent running (1hr/30mins).\n\n### Instrucution: If \"10,000 + 8 = 10,008\" and \"15 - 8 = 7\", then what is the answer to the following equation after removing \"7\"?\n\n15 + 8 = 23\n\n### Rationales:\nThe answer would be -1. The problem is asking us to remove \"7\" from the equation. Since 15 + 8 also equals 23, we are actually adding \"7\" to both sides of the equation because neither value of \"7\" can be removed.\n\nWe are subtracting one, but we are still multiplying by -1 -2 * \"7\".\n\nSo, the answer would ultimately be -1.\n\n### Solution of (x-5)(2x-7).\n\nThe solution is x = 2.

{"text": "### Rationale:\nIf Mary and Frank feed Luna 2 cups every day between them, that means there are 19 cups of kibbles for Luna in a week and 35 cups of kibbels in a month. Starting with a new 12-cup kibbles bag, Mary will run out of kibbles in a month, as she feeds Luna 19 cups in a single month (19/35).\n\nBut even if Frank provides 4 cups in the morning (20 - 19 = 1) it means that the monthly total of his feeding + Mary's feeding + leftovers now amount to 20 + 19 = 39 cups. But these add to 35 cups at the end of the month.\n\n### There are too few kibbles in the new bag to get Mary through a month at 19 cups a month.\n\nSo if on the same day that Frank provides 4 cupes of kibbles in the morning, he provides 5 cups of kbibbles in the evening, Mary has an extra total of 36 cups in a week.\n\nIf Frank again provides 4 cups of kibbes in the morning, he will provide 10 more cups of kibles in the evening. Thus, Mary now has an extra total of (10 + 9) cups in a day, or 19 cups.\n\nBut if we carry this out, the next day Mary will have 19 cups, as Frank would provide 1 cup in the afternoon, bringing her total kibbles for the month to 40.\n\n### But if we keep extending, even if Frank gives 2, 3, or 5 cups a week, \nMary will always fall short of 40 weekly cups. But Mary's job requires that she provide 40 cups.\n### Thus, Luna has to eat her kibbles somewhere else.\n\n### So the answer is E: anywhere\n### Rationale\nIf Luna only eats the kibbles supplied by her Masters in their household, she will always fall short of the required amount of kibbles (provided that they are the only", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "1. First, let's understand what type of question this is. It is a computation question. \n2. We are seeking the time remaining at point C. The first condition is, the oven is heated, or C \u2192 H. The first instruction in the scenario is \" Heating the oven\", therefore, the time remaining is H if the heating is taken into account. \n3. The second condition is, Bill put his french frieds in the oven, or B \u2192 C. \n\n4. The third condition is what I call a'sensorial condition', or S \u2192 C. \n The sensorial condition is a type of conditional statement where the only way to be sure the event occurs is to have sensory input that confirms its occurrence. In this case, there is no other way to be sure the fries were in the oven than to have a sense of heat, smell, or even sight. But we exclude this condition from the formal logic because it might not be reliable, so we don't apply it to the formal logic to show steps that will work 100% of the time. The sensorial condition I am using here is the heated oven. Because the heated oven is present only after B \u2192 C, it must be removed from the conditional statement and inserted into the S \u2192 C condition. In the case of fries in an oven, if the oven is too cool, the fries won't be cooked properly. So this would be an example of an S \u2192 C scenario where the event of being able to see if the fries are cooked properly would only exist if the oven was at a certain temperature. \n\n5. Therefore, we will use S \u2192 C = H to conclude the time remaining at C \u2192 H. \n6. Now, let'S consider each of the four options. Option 1 says 1 minute, 28 seconds. \n7.

In the response, \"takes a lot of expensive vacation\" refers also to the boss.  However, we know that \"my boss\" was in the subject position. The sentence \"he takes a lot of expensive\" does not make any sense as it refers to the subject, but the subject is not the subject of the sentence, if that makes any sense.\n4.

There is $366.50 in total cost: the cost of the shoes and the initial cost of $250 that was added later.\n3. If he charges the full amount, he would make $160.50 in total.\n4.

{"text": "The machine can produce 41,333 cans of soda in 8 hours.\n\nThe question gives us the information that one machine makes 30 cans every 30 minutes. If we have the machine for 8 hours, we can figure how many times 30 minutes it will run. Hence, 8 times 30 minutes equals 240 minutes and 240 minutes divided by 30 equals 8. Multiply that by 30 and we have 240 times 30 equals 7200 cans. We now have 8 hours multiplied by 7200 equals 57,600 divided by 30 cans equals 1,953.33 cans. Multiply that number by 30 can again equals 57,399.99 cans and then the remainder of 33.33, rounding down to 33.3 cans.

This term has been used with different meanings in different sciences including chemistry, geology, physics, etc.\nOur planet, Earth, has an inner layer known as the 'core' in physics. The core in the Earth is said to be where the hottest temperatures are found.\nConsidering this, we must analyze what the sentence: \"If our planet\u2019s core is the hugest place in the universe...\" means.\nBecause this sentence uses the word 'planet' instead of Earth, it can only be related to our Earth, and the hottest place it refers to is the core in our planet, Earth.\nThe next question naturally emerges: Why does life not exist on Earth's core, if according to the given sentence, it is the hottest part in our universe?\nClearly, there seems", "answer": " 480"}
{"text": "(1.5*160)/100 = 51.6/100 = 16\n\n### Rationale:\nThe given problem states that we have to determine the total number of animals in a compound with frogs, dogs, and cats. \n\nThe two quantities that are known are:\n\n\u2022 The number of dogs is 20% lower than the number of cats.\n\u2022 There are twice as many frogs than the number of dogs in a compound.\n\nFrom that information, we conclude that the total number of cats in a compound with the given information must be 60% times the number of frogs, which is calculated as:  \n\n```\n 160 = 150 / 0.60                                                              (1)\n 160 * 0.60 = 100                                                               (2)\n160 = 60                                                                     (3)\n```\n\nAfter dividing both sides of the equation (1) by 0.4 (0.6/ 60 and 0.6 * -100 / 160), the solution is 51.6. \n\nThen, taking into account (3) that we know the number of frogs is 160, which is given in the question, we can now find the total number of animals.\nBy using the following equation: \n\n(1 + 2)/(1 + 2 + 3) = 2/6 = 1/3, then we get 1/3 of the frogs are cats, which is 16/49, which is 1/3 cats, therefore, there are 51.6 less cats than there are frogs, therefore, we can conclude that there are 60 + 51.6 < animals, which is 111.6.

{"text": "The charcoal grill ran for three-and-a-half hours.\n\n### Rationale: The question is asking how long the grill ran. The answer can be derived by using these equations:\n\n$15 / 20 = (60) / 3$\n\n$15 \\div 20 = 60 \\div 3$\n\nSince 60 is divided by 3, the answer can be simplified to 2. Hence, we can see that the grill ran for two times 20 minutes. This can be further simplified to 40 minutes.\n\nNow 40 minutes is converted to hours, which comes out to be 40 / 60 = 0.667 = 0.6hrs.\n\nNext to this, the question says that the grill ran long enough to burn 3 bags of coals, which means that:\n\n$ 1 = 3 \\text{ bags of coals}$\n\nWhen we put this in equation form:\n\n$ 3 = 60 / 15$\n\nFrom here, we take out 3 bags' worth of the number of coals that can be burnt in a grill:\n\n $\\frac{480}{60}$ = ${60 \\text{ coals}}$\n\nTaking the final quotient:\n\n$7 = 60$\n\nHence, the answer is that the charcoal grill runs for 7 bags of coals in a time span of 0.66 = 0.6 hrs.\n\n### Input::If a truck travels 75 kilometres and takes ten minutes to travel each kilometre, how far would a truck travel in that time?\n\n### Rationales: The answer to this question can be derived using logic.

The question requires us to answer how much money a person should get if they work 52 weeks in a year, if they work 8.5hours a day every week.\n2. To determine how much money the person should get it is essential to break down the number of days to work a week in a year, then multiply it by the number of hours the person works in a day.\n3. It is also essential to determine the multiplier and the period in days within which the person is expected to work for.\n4. For a person to work 8.5 hours for a day, the person should work 5 times a day for a week.\n5. Since there are 52 weeks in the year, based on the number of days, the person is expected to be working atleast 52 weeks a year.\n6.

Hence the answer to the question would represent the total sales made by Mr. Brandon in cash. \n  \n  \n  \n#### Calculation: \nSince credit sales (2/5) have been already deducted, it is evident that the customers who visited Mr. Brandon' s shop only made cash sales.\nNow, as credit sales took up 2/5 of total sales of $80, which means they can be subtracted from 5/5 and this resulting number, $60, will represent cash sales. \n  \nWe can calculate this in two ways: \n\n1) We can multiply the cash sales by 3 because the total sales consisted of 3 parts and not 2 and then by 5 (number of people) to determine the share of each person in this purchase as follows: $\\\\$80\\times\\text{5}\\times\\text{3}=400 - \\text{ }\\$20\\=$380$\n\n2) We can simply multiply $\\frac {40}{50}$ by $80$. This would make it more simple to solve the equation $\\frac {400}{50}$. Since this number has been calculated above already, we don't have to calculate", "answer": " 48"}

In this question, the word \"combined\" is used twice; once to refer to something that is shared by all parties together, and the other to indicate some number added.\n2. To sum this correctly, we must determine Olga's total number of stripes then determine Rick's total number of missing stripes, then find the difference between the two.\n3. From the statement, we know that Hortense has double Olga's number of stripes, so Hortense's total number of pair stripes is already 2x the total of Olga's number stripes.\n4. Therefore, we can use Hortense's number of stripe pairs and then subtract Olga's total to find Rick's total.\n5. So, all in all, the number of stripe pairs for each student is:\n6.  Olga:3(since she has 3 stripes on each).\n7.  Rick:1 - (1 because he has the same number of stripes as Olga, except he has 1 less).\n8.  Hortense: 2 - (2 because she has 2 more pairs than Olga, but the same number of stripe).\n9.  Therefore we sum Olga, and subtract Rick and Hortense to get:\n10.  Olga + (Rick - 1) =\n11.  Olga + Hortense - (2) =\n12.  Olga + 1.5 =\n13.  Olga + Rick + Hortense - 3 =\n14.  Olga+2 - 3 (because there are 3 stripes each, that is 2 pairs) =\n15.  Olga+1 =", "answer": " 22"}

We first must eliminate the choices that do not apply to Africa. Zoo A, Wild C, home D, and circus E are all things elephants could be found outside of Africa. \n2. An elephant in the home D is a strange, almost impossible scenario as they get pretty big. That leads to C and D being eliminated. For circus E, while it is possible for elephants to be found in such settings, it isn't a specific place, so option E is removed as well. For option A, a zoo is definitely not a wild place for an elephant. However, zoo A could be found outside of the location, so it could also eliminate option A. Because of that, we're left with either option B, which could be for Africa or outside. And option E, could be for Africa or could not. \n3. We're left with options B and E. To choose the best choice, we look at what both Africa and the desert have. If the elephant is in Africa, it is almost guaranteed to have water (such as lakes and rivers), greenery, and vegetation. \n4. If the elephants is in the desert, it would have only sand, rock, and dry vegetation. We also need to consider the wildlife found in the desert and the wildlife found in Africa. If an elephant is in the desert, they are more than likely to not run into any animals (such as lions or zebras), only coyotes and jackals, because those are the types of animals that would live in desert. \n5.

He sold 135 gallon per $1.2, which makes 191.13 dollars for Monday (135 gallons \u00d7 15 = 127 gallons \u00d7.12 = 191.44 dollars). He made 143.43 dollars after the five-inch rain on Monday (135 \u2013 127 = 8 gallons \u00d7.15 = 143.56 dollars). He made $234.59 after two inches of rain on Monday.  He made $213.62 after two inches of Monday.  He made 345.05 dollars after five inches of rain  (135 \u00d7.15 = $18.88) on Monday.  How much money was he making  for selling all the water on Tuesday?  He made $34.50 for selling all the Monday rainwater  for that day. He made $44.55 for selling all the Tuesday rain for that day. James made $79 from collecting the rainwater he did on Monday, and $89 from collecting rain on Tuesday.  The total is $168. That's James's profit when he collects rainwater and sells it. This is also 4.13%. How much percent profit did James make on 3 inches of Monday rain  from 10 AM Monday until 12 PM Tuesday?  How much profit did James make on Monday after one inch of rain?  Answer: The percent profit per day calculation is made from 10:00 AM the previous Monday until 12:00 PM the next day.

Since they make 1/3 of it's sales to those who went to the fabric section, 1/3 of 36 is 14.\n2. Since they make 2/5 of it's sales from the stationary section, 2/5 of 36 is around 7.\n3. And from the rest of 36 that are left.\n4. 36-14-7 is 24. That means they made $24 from the other section.\n5. If we add the previous ones we get 14+7+24=45. The question said that 21 = 45.\n### Explaination: For better understanding here is a breakdown of the problem \n\n21 is = 45, which needs to be added in reverse order for this:\n\n45 = 31 + 14\n\n14 = 21 - 21\n\n31 = 31 + x\n\nWhere x is the amount of sales in the stationary section(21). After adding 31 x to 21, you will have the final answer of 52, which then needs to be subtracted with the amount of sales they made on the fabric and jewelery sections, but there are two ways to do this.\n\n1.

{"text": "The total number of feet of yarn she used to make her second ball, is 54.\n\n### Rationales: To find the answer to this question, we first need to determine how many feet of yarn Joy used to make her third ball. This can be found by dividing 27 by 3 to obtain 9.\n\nNext, we need to know how many more feet of yarn did Joy use for her second ball? This can be found by subtracting the number of feet of yarnd used for the third ball (27) from the number of feet of yard used for Joy's second ball (54), which gives us 27 \u2013 54 = -27. This tells us that Joy used 27 more feet of yarn for her second ball than she did for her third ball.\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of feet she used for her third ball (9) by the difference found previously (-27), to calculate 9 x -27 = 233, which indicates that Joy used 233 feet of yarn for Joy's second.\n\n### Solution: A logical conclusion is that when dividing balls of yarn equally, the larger ball will always contain more yards of yarn than the smaller ball, but this ratio is inversely proportional to the ratio of the size of the balls.\n\n### Input : What does a frog sit upon? \n\n### Instructions: Give a one-word answer containing \"a seat for (a frog)\".\n\n### Rationale: Option (e) is a \"toad stool\" or a \"toad's throne\" in the English vernacular; that, in essence, could mean a frog's seat.\n\n### Answer:\n\nAnswer: e)\n\n### Ration:\n\n### Input:: What does a mammal sit upon?\n\n### Ratios :\n\n### Instutions: Answer with an appropriate animal, with legs.\n\n### Reactions\n\n### Answer :\n\nAnswer:\n\n### Rations :\n\n### Inputs\n\nInput: If the price of a car goes up will its value go up?\n\nInput: The amount of energy it takes to travel from one city to another depends on the time", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "17 packages\n\n### Rationales: \n\n1. Firstly we consider the context of the question and decide where to place the emphasis on the information. \n\n2. The sentence states that the owner of a restaurant wanted to prepare traditional food, i.e. Turkish-style dishes, for an occasion that will be taken place in the future. This makes it clear that the situation is quite urgent and that the restaurant owner's only concern is to find the necessary ingredients for the dishes she intends to cook. \n\n3. We further assume that Turkish cuisine may be considered as part of the Eastern cuisine in general. This means that Turkish cuisine and food in general has two basic properties: first, the ingredients are based on certain staple products (onion, tomato, salt, and pepper) which can be found in every traditional kitchen and then there are certain spices (fennel, coriander, etc.) that can also be bought at any supermarket and are characteristic for Turkish food. Finally, the third property is that the spices are used in quite small amounts and therefore their prices can vary significantly.\n\n4. Starting from this, we look at the information that is relevant for our answer and answer the following questions: where and how many packages came from each butcher? How many butchers delivered ground beef? What is the weight of the packages delivered by all three butchers? \n\n5. Then, we have to organise the data in a way that our answer is supported by all the information. It must therefore be clear that:\n\n6. a) the beef delivered by all three butcher is the same;\n\n7. b) it weighs 100 pounds. \n\n8.

Choices: 1) 2 ft 2) 4 ft 3) 6 ft 4) 8 ft\n\nRationales: We first compare the words that define the length of the kite: all the options are \"kite\". When we see the difference between long and short, we may think of short words being more preferable and more likely to apply to us. Kite is a short string but it does not specify the length, but can be any length. Hence, the answer would be 'kite'.\n\nInput: Different languages may have separate words for different shades of what? Choices 1) blue 2) red 3) green 4) white\n\nRationales; We can analyze each of the options separately,\n\nOption 1: blue is a single colour and, \n\nOption 2: If red is a common word in the language used and there is a single word for all the varieties of red, then, it would be more relevant to the question and the answer would be red.\n\nOption 3: In multiple languages, such as French and Spanish, green has more complex words depending on the type of green involved. Green in the context of green grass is different from the green skin complexion - both of which are commonly used words. This is referred to as having multiple words or synonyms for a specific term.\n\nOption 4: white is always the universal first color one associates a child with when thinking about a snowy winter scene. This is also a complex term which represents many things. It's much more than just snow, as it includes everything which is not colorful like dark skin complexion and black. It includes neutral colours like beige. Having a single word for a colour, is never a universal first association in a certain language.\n\nAnswer: Red", "answer": " 35"}
{"text": "The answer is option B: $15.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIt can be seen from the question that the standard price of a one year subscription is $80 and it got further reduced by a discount of 45%.\n\nTo find the reduction in price we have given our final price $(x) = y% of total $(80).\n\nSo, \n\n$(x)$ = $(y x)$/100\n\nThis gives us\n\n$(x) = (y x)$ $80$\n\nAnd, $y = (x/50) x 100$,\n\nThis now leads to the formula for solving this kind of question.\n\nAnd, according to our given question,\n\n$(x) $ = $((1 - 0,45) x$)/100\n\nOr, $x = 0,1425*$\n\nThis can be further simplified to $\\$14.25$.\n\nHence the correct option is \\$14.25 and the same is the final answer to the quastion.\n\n\n### The solution that was provided by the Grammers is incorrect.\n\nHere is the Grammers' response of how much the discounted subscription:\n\nWe have solved by first putting the $80 in place of $x$(x is equal to $80$).\n\nSo,\n\ny = ( ($0.55x)/$100) = ( ($0.15)/5) = ($0.3$)\n\nAnd,\n\nx = ( yx)/100 = ( $0.3$ $x)/100 $ = ( $0.03x)/100 )\n\nThis leads to the formula to solve this type of question:\n\ny = ( x/5) = ($30x)/($35 x $15)) = $5/75),\n\nAnd,\nx = ($5$($0.03 x)) = ( $0.15 x)(5/75)) = ( $0,15/165 )) = $0,009463 $\n\nThis gives us our answer as x = $0,15 /165) = ($0,0", "answer": " 44"}

How much did Sarah pay to buy her house?\"\n\n### Response:\"B: $142\"\n\n### Demo:\n**Step-2** To make the profit, Sarah spends 75% of profit on improvements. Sarah paid $4000 to buy the house so she spent $3000. To make a profit you have to subtract the expenses you incurred to buy the house. Sarah had a profit of $12860. Sarah's profit = 14260-4000.  \n\nAs $75% is 14265. $3000 < 14266. So, when Sarah's profit = $14260 and She spent $3001 then Her profit left with her = $14259. Hence 15000x0.25 =1250.

So, it was a distant noise on the far side of the river. The term \"on his side of the river\" means the opposite bank of the river. So, it is a distant noise that's coming on the opposite side of the river.\nTo show that he is on his own side of the river, \"man wearing his favorite boars\" needs the word \"his\". With \"His own\" meaning from his side, as he himself will be wearing his own boots. \"Other\", as it is a distant sound on the opposite side of river is wrong option.

{"text": "Their fourth child has a birthday on the thirtieth birthday of their third child.\n\n### Rationales: 1) Start by identifying an important fact. The first child was born fifteen years ago.  This fact allows us to narrow down when the other children were born. \n2) The birth order of the children is important. Jolene and Phil gave birth to their first two children exactly one year apart.  They gave birth again on the fourth year anniversary of the birth of the second child.  Two years after the last birth, they gave birth to the fourth child.  The third child is the only one born in the middle. \n3) Start by picking a child from the list. This gives us the starting birth date.  We know that the previous children are born one year apart.  The next child will then be born two years after the preceding child's birthday. \n4) We begin to build a pattern.  The first child is born in 1987, the year Jolene and Phil were married.  The second, third and fourth children were born in 1990. The third child is therefore thirteen years old in 2003.  The next child must be born two years later in 2005. \n5) Now plug the age of the third child into 2008, the year the next child would be born.  This leaves us with a date, which we plug back into 2011.  The child in question will thus be born in February of 2011, which means it is 15 years old in 24. \n6) Confirm a specific day is the child's birthday, by applying the rules about the order in which children are said to be born. Our first clue is their fourth child's birthday coincides with the fourth birthday of the third child, which gives us a clue: February 28th. Next, we know the fourth child is born two years after the third. This will take us to February 28th of 2015. \n7) This, however, may not be the child's birth date. If we know the pattern for how many years between each child, we might be able to know what month the fourth child is in. \n8) Aside from", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "The problem in a nutshell is that Austin buys seven friends $8.75 robots in total, which costs him $7.22 after tax. Then the change he gets is $11.54, but the question asks him how much he had started with, meaning what was his change before he bought the robots. This means he's left with $11,54-8.75=2.79, but now his change is $11.80, so this can't be right. After some consideration, using the knowledge that we get.25 cents in change for a dollar when tax is charged, we subtract 7.22 from.25 cents, and we get 6.97 cents, meaning that Austin started with $6.97 and ended up with $11.86.\n\n#### Input: The solution is to subtract the amount owed in sales tax plus the price of the item from the total owed.

Our first question is how many stories is it, first we take height of a story = 14ft 2. We know that we have buy the same length of rope as the height of the building we have already calculated one story is equal to 15ft as it is given to us and that is 14feet x 10, what we have done here is taken the first story height of 14 to convert feet to feet and 10 to convert it from feet to 15 we multiply by 14 x 15.\n3. Now let's understand which one is the longest we have the length of rope given to us by the problem writer or the height of the building and you know what i mean by that you get a question like buy a rope of length 100 and buy a rope one meter longer than that or if you want to buy a rope that is 100 times that, that is what i was talking about which is the problem writer.\n4.

Each option must be multiplied by 5 before being combined to get the answer. \n\nThe answer cannot be a combination of multiple options. \n\nIf we use our knowledge of addition, we can determine that the answer must have come from a multiplying or dividing statement. We can also eliminate the possibility of an addition statement from any of the choices by comparing them to our known formula. \n\nAddition is always combined with the word \"with\" or \"and\" when being written in a mathematical context.

He sublets to three people, and each of them pays him $400. \nRationales: Let's calculate the profit in a year with the information given. \nWe know that the amount of rent received by John is $900, and he received it from three people. This value is the same as the monthly rent they pay. So, multiplying it by 12 will give us a yearly amount of $10,800.\nNow, let's figure out how much money John will get if each person pays him $40. That means that John is making a profit of $480, which is equal to $180 each person. So, he will get a total of $600 ($180*3) from each of them if he sublets the apartment for a full year.\nIn the end, John will get $600 from each of them for 12 months.  The total for the whole year is $7200.\nTherefore, John's profit would be: $10,890 \u2014 $7200 = $3690\nAnswer: $3690.", "answer": " 3600"}

Now, we can determine how long the room was cleaned by subtracting L and H since they are the only time spent cleaning.  \nLet'a denote the total number of rooms cleaned as R and let's denote their total in minutes as T.

How many eggs did the frogs lay over the span of 4 days?\"\nThis sentence does not accurately represent the request being asked.\nBy choosing to use the given sentence, we have to be careful in the choice of words.\nThis is because the given sentence can be understood as a different question. \nIt may be read as, \"How many eggs did the froggs (sic) lay over the span of four days,\" where the additional \"G\" represents the plural of the word \"frog\". \nThis is incorrect as given frogs only have one frog each.

This makes the first jar 15 marbles.\n\nWe also know that Jar C has twice as much marbles as jar A. \n\nThis would lead to jar C having 244 marbles.\n\nNow, since we know that the total number of marbeles is 90, we also know that jar B is the third jar.\n\nWe find out that jar B is not the least possible jar, so we know that the number of marbles \n\nIn jar B is slightly more than that in jar C, since jar A has 28, it would have 252 marbles.\n\nSo the number of marbles in jar B is the difference between the number of marbles of jar C and the number of marbles A, which gives us an answer of 21.\n\n### Input:\"It's a very big castle\" \"Are there any more interesting things to see?\" \"Yes there is a room where there is a huge statue of a naked king in gold\" \"What is the room like?\" \"It's very beautiful\" \"What does it look like?\" \"It' s a huge empty gold room\" \"Any more interesting things in the castle?\" \"No, nothing else.\"\n\n### Response:\"It's a huge empty gold room.\"\n\n### Explain answer:\nSince this is a riddle, there is no set of specific rules for what the answer would have to be.\n\nSometimes riddles are easier to solve if you look at questions which have similar wordings.\n\nIn this case, this riddle can be compared to: https://www.mentalhelp.net/blogs/a-riddle-a-castle-and-gold/\n\nAs per that riddle:\n\n>The room, of course, was gold, both the walls and the floor.\n\n>The man in the room was also clothed in gold, but he", "answer": " 148"}

{"text": "Sales tax is charged as a percentage of the total amount of goods purchased.\n\nWe'll do a \"forward elimination\" starting with sales tax. We note that sales tax is charged after the product is fully assembled. Sales tax is never charged beforehand. In other words, products purchased in a store are never taxed at full price. This eliminates options A, B, C, and D.\n\nNext, we turn to the three products themselves. To purchase three of each product, the sales tax on the three T-shirts and three sweaters is calculated before sales tax. If any one of the items were not taxable, sales tax wouldn't be included in the calculation. Hence, the sales tax is calculated in the following sequence; tax on T-shirts + tax on sweaters + tax on jackets.\n\nNext, the price is added before the 10% reduction. This leaves us with the following scenario:\n\n\\+ TAX\n= X\n\nFrom the price of the jacket, we subtract the discount price of $98 to calculate what the product would have cost.\n\nIf the answer to the previous equation is between zero and 5, then we have met the requirement, so \"the answer is $901.18\". If the answer is six then the answer is $916.94, because we can deduct the tax on a product that costs 28 which is $10.52.\n\n### Input\n\nThe shopping center\u2019s sales tax rate is 5%.\n\nA pair of jeans at this shopping center costs $39.\n\nTogether, four shirts and four pairs of jeans cost $90.\n\nHow much would seven pairs of jeans cost at this shopping center?\n\nAnswer: \n\nAs a rule of thumb, when faced with this type of question, consider the cost of one \"additional\" item to be _2 * tax rate_ (e.g. 10). The question wants one of the items to be x more than the others, so 4 * x = 2 * tax rate, or x = 2/4 * tax rate.

So, Tammy was 16 more than a third of this difference.\n\n6. This can be further simplified by multiplying both sides by a common denominator. \n\n7.

{"text": "1. First, let's determine how many packages the centers each process per hour.\n2. Both centers are processing approximately the same number of packages per day, but they are processing them at different rates.\n3. Since the second center is processing three times the number of packages as the first, it makes sense that it is also going about it in an equally efficient manner.\n4. Then, after some calculation, we arrive at the following conclusion:\n5. A center can pack 8000 packages per hour, or 13 packages per minute, or 0.25 packages every 3 seconds.\n6. That means the first Amazon distribution center processes 4000 packages each hour, and the second processes 12,000 packages each day.\n7. After some more calculation, a center can produce enough packages to make $5 in profits in a day.\n8. By now, we have enough information to calculate profit per week:\n9. To find profit per week, we must first determine how many days there are per week; this is roughly 5.\n10.

When we add 300 seeds to this amount we have over 400 seeds.\n\n### Response 2:B: 300\n\n### Response Rationale:\nHere, they are given three statements: *Yeon has three time as many seeds as Gwi.* *Gwi has 40 times more seeds than Bom.* And, *Bom has 300 seede.*\nEach statement describes a certain relationship. By combining all three, we see that if *Gwi has 300 more seeds than three times as many as Bom* we can see that Bom has 120 more seeds than Yeon. So if the three have together **400 seeds**,**then Bom has 30 seeds.**\n\n### Input Question 1: A man, a woman, and 12 people go out to eat. The man pays double price for himself and woman pays double the price for herself. 5 of the remaining 12 people pay twice the price for 5 people, 1 pays 4 times the price for 1, and the last pays x times the price for him or herself. This doesn't have to add to 50. This also implies that the man and woman each pay a different amount. What is x?\n\n### Input Answer: B: 3.\n\n### Rationales: 1: All people get multiplied except for the number 5. 2: All men and women get multiplied except for man and woman. 3: All people that don't get multiplied are in the group of 5. This means they need to add up to 50. 4: x * x = 50 - because all people except for man and woman and others all add up to 5 and x adds up to 13.\n\n## Part 1: Alpha & Beta\n\nYou were given a story about a character called Alpha.

{"text": "33 1/3 hours\n\n### Dem\n\nRationales:  1. To answer the question, we need to determine how much time Grace would need to finish reading a 4x250-page = 1000-page book. \n2. As she can finish a 200 page book in 20h, we can calculate it's size using basic math:\n```\n200 / 20 h = 10 pages / hour\n```\n\n3. After doing so, we can apply 200 pages to the 250 page book and multiply both sides to get the size of the larger 4x25=100 book:\n```\n250 x 10 = 2500 pages\n```\n\n4. Now, we can calculate the time the girl would take to finish this book. We start off by multiplying the size of the book(25x250) to 100(the size of the single 200-pages book the girl read previously):\n```\n50 x 12= +600\n```\n\n5. We now multiply the 600 pages with the girls reading speed: 1000 pages/20 hours= 50 pages an hour=6 books which means that the girl will take 66 2/3 hours to finish the book.\n\n6. To find which answer is closest to 66 233 minutes, we can just multiply the previous number(66 2/13) with 2.5 hours which brings us to 33 12/3 hours.

{"text": "The word one is ambiguous in the calculation of legs number.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe question states that tarantula egg sacs contain a thousand tarantulas. If I know there are eight legs in average for a single tarantula and there are twelve tarantulas in one egg sac, then the calculation is easy. However, if a sentence like \"one tarantula egg sac\" is intended to convey the same number of tarantulas, one thousand, then the numbers get a little bit tricky. For the sake of simplicity, it's common to assume that one tarantula egg sack contains 200 tarantulas and do the math. However, that means if one is intended to convey the number of tarantulas of a thousand, then there is a discrepancy in the calculation of leg number (i.e., one leg versus 200 legs).\n\n### Input One-sentence question:  If a tarantula has one thousand legs, and one hundred eggs in an egg sac, how many eggs in two egg sacs?\nInput: One-sentence question Two-sentence question: If a tarantula \n### Response:  \n\n### Examplation:\nWhen two sentences are conjoined by the word \"if,\" then the word \"then\" usually follows, creating a clear transition between the two sentences.

Choices: \nA: improves revenue B: increases inventory C: reduces spending D: encourages customer satisfaction E: streamlines operations\nRationales:\n1. The question is asking what is the manager is doing well in terms of increasing the sales of her team.\n2. This question is asking which of the given options is the manager performing well, which means there is no negative connotation to 'doing well'.\n3. In terms of sales, there are two main types of revenue streams - increase in sales volume or increase in the average transaction value.\n4. If the revenue is increasing, then it is most likely due to an increase in the average transaction (amount purchased).\n5. The other factors such as inventory, spending, and customer satisfaction do not need to be considered because they don't necessarily point to an increase in sales.\n6. Therefore the best answer would be option A: improves revenue.\n7. This is because of the increase in average transaction which is the most likely cause for an increase in revenue.\n8. The other options, while they could have played a role in increasing revenue, do not necessarily mean that they are doing well.\n9.

We can also cross off the others that have lesser numbers given, such as governor Sloan who gave more than sandoval but not as much as Hawkins.\n5. Then, the answer must be between governor Sandoval and governor Hawkins's times because they're the only ones to give commencement addresses and they did so repeatedly.\n6.

There are no duplicates in his friends.  Who has more friends than Jonathan who he does not want to hang out with?\n\n### Rationales: Let's look at everyone in the question and how well they do at giving answers that do not contain duplicates. Each person given has their own unique number of hours they can hang out with someone and have a lot of friends. This question states that there are no overlapping friendships, so the number of friends each person in the question has cannot overlap.\n\n### The answer will be someone who does not have as many friends as Jonathan does and he does not want to see them for a specific number of hours (4 in this question). So we find the people who meet these requirements using logic.\n\nThe person that has the same number of friends as the friend he does not want to spend more than four hours with is the person with the most friends that we do not want to have more than four hours with.\n\n### If Jonathan has many friends, there are no duplicates, it would be safe to say that he is a social person. To have that many friends he probably was friends with people for years. So he might not want to hang out for four hours with anyone he had known for a while so they can have the time to themselves. Instead he might want to hire a babysitter so he can spend time with friends who he did not grow up with or that he just met. That is where the most common response would be four hours. If he just met a friend, he probably would not want to hang out four hours at a time or be around them", "answer": " 81"}

{"text": "Carla has one more than the number of students who do not sit in the last row.\n\n### Rationale: Let's start with the information given to us.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the information given in the 'Attendance' section. We are told that:\n\n1. 2 students are in restroom\n2. one less than three times the number of students are absent\n3. there are four rows with 6 desks per each\n4. each row is 2/3 full\n5. one of the rows is completely full\n\nTo begin analysing these statements, it is first important to determine how we can interpret these.\n\n1. There being two students in the restroom suggests it is either on the left or the right of the classroom, as this would require a total of six students.\n2. Using the numbers given in the question to fill out the data as shown in the diagram below:\n\nNow, as each row is 2 out of 3 full, it follows that the number of students must be 15, because there are 4 rows in total. In other words, one row is full and the other 3 rows are each 2/3 full. This means that each has 5 students, resulting in a total of 15. Therefore, the correct answer for the question is 15 students overall.\n\nNow, let's analyze the 'Teaching' section. We are informed that there are 4 rows each with 6 desks which mean that there are 24 desks in total, and 4 desks in each row. Using this we can deduce that:\n\n1st row - 5 students\n2nd - 5 students\n3rd - 6 students\n\nBut that leaves one student missing. To find that missing student, we look at who sits in the fourth and last row which is empty. Let's assume each row has only 5 students, then the last row isn't missing 2 students, but 4, leaving 1 student still to find.\n\nThe missing student must be within one of the remaining 3 rows in which the other rows are 2/3 full as indicated earlier.\n\nOne of the rows is full, and the other 3 are each 2/4 full which means they have 5 students in total.

{"text": "Andy is 10 years older.\n\n### Explanation of response:\nInput: In 5 years, Andy is twice as old as Rahm is now. Rahm is 6 now. Andy is thus four times as old as Rahm. Rahm is 15 in 5 years, and Andy will be 89 years old at this time.\n\n### Next, we do the following:\nRationales:1.  Andy is twice as old and Rahm is now. \n2. We're told that, in 5 years, Andy's age will be four times twice his age now. \n3. Subtracting twice Rahm's age from twenty years, Rahm's age in 5 years is Rahm's age.\n4.

Let's assume that Randy started with 100 dollars in his piggybank.\n\nThe answer choice is c because c = a + b = 88, which is the number of dollars Randall had before he started spending money on his trips to the store plus the amount of money he lost while making payments to the store.", "answer": " 200"}

The problem states that each vampire turns five people into vampires every night. This implies a linear relation between the number of vampires and the number of individuals that they convert. \n3. There are two vampires who turn five people into vampire each night, so the total number of vampires will be A: 40 + B: 70 = 110  \n4. After 10 nights there will be a population of 500  \n5.

After 2 more nights they will convert 5 more people and there will be a population 10 + 2 = 12. So after 4 nights the population will be 20 + 2 + 5 = 27 = 3.  \n7. After two more nights, 27 vampires will be turned into vampires. \n8. The number of vampires after two more nights will be B: 27 + 27 = 54 = 4.\n9.

We have to consider what other options could possibly lead to this circumstance if we are not told of it.  If there is more than one way we could come to the conclusion stated in the question, we must consider each of the choices that explain the circumstance most appropriately.\n\nFor instance: Alice asks \"how much is the cut?\" because she thinks there is some sort of discount in the whole exchange but wants to know what the specific amount of that discount may be. \n\nMike only knows the price of the chicken. 1. He has the option to show her the price and give her a discount of $2. 2. He could decide that he could offer the chicken at $5 as the price but he doesn't offer to discount anything. \n\nIf Mike is going to be helpful and give her a discout, he should discount the price of the chiken.

{"text": "1 hour 30 minutes 45 seconds\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Let's solve this question a step at a time. \n1. There are 8 loads of Laundry. This means 8 washing cycles followed by 8 dry cycles. \n2. Each load of Laundry takes (45 x 8) = 360 Minutes to complete the washing and 1 (x 8) = 8 Hours to complete the drying cycle. \n3. Thus a total of 44hrs 45m would be needed to complete any set of Laundry.\n4. So if we need to complete 8 loads then we will need to finish 8*44hrs 35m = 333hrs 45min\n5. This is equivalent to 333hr 45min or 1 day 5hr 45min which is 1hr 30min 45sec \n6.

The choices provided allow for a simplistic way to solve this by taking each cake as the denominator and the children as numerator. \n2. The denominator in each choice can be used to split up 16 to the total amount of choices. \n3. So we can use 4 children to be given 1 cake, 2 children to be given 2 cakes and so on.  \n4. So we multiply the childes by 2 to get 8 which then becomes 8/4 to get the final number which answers for the choice 4 birthday c", "answer": " 14"}

For this, we have to know how much square feet belong to the fruit section (16 square feet). Next, we subtract the square feet used for strawberry (6); this is the number of square feet for other fruit. \nNext, we have to divide the fruit section into 4 equal parts to figure out how many square feet is allotted for strawberry.\n\n### Rationales:\nIn words, Joel\u2019s garden has 4 quarters.

If Kevin can eat 64 hot wings in 8 hours, then how many more hot wings must Alan eat in a minute to beat Kevin\u2019 first? \n2) Using the question prompt, we can see that the following equation is given to us: C + 8 = S, where C is the time taken by Alan (in minutes) and S is the quantity of hot wings consumed by Kevin (in number of wings). \n3) We need to solve for the variable C, which can be done by setting it equal to the right hand side of the equation: C = S / 8. \n4) Now, we can substitute 8 for C in the equation, yielding 5 (as the variable C is defined), and S. Substituting these values into the right hand side of our original equation gives us S(64/1) = S. \n5) Rearranging gives us: S\u00b2 \u2013 S(64/S) = 0. \n6) Multiplying the top and bottom by the same value gives us: S\u00b2 + 68S - 64S\u00b2 = 0. 7) Since 68 is a prime number, we can rewrite our equation as either: -(24S \u2013 16) = 0, or: (-24S + 16) = -4S + 4. 8) We can isolate the variable by subtracting 4 from both sides, yielding: (-24S) = -17, or (-24S) - (-17) 9) Then, subtracting each side by 2 gives: (-24S \u2013 (-17) + 2) = -15. This leaves us with: ((24 \u2013 17)S) = -15 10) Adding (-31) to both sides yields: (24S) + (-31) = -15 + (-31) 11) Subtracting the bottom from both sides gives us: 24S = 48 \n12) Divide both sides by 24, and", "answer": " 4"}

And further assuming that Ludwig is paid for the whole day he worked (meaning that he does not get paid on half day) and thus gets paid exactly $10 for a full working day, what is Ludwig's weekly salary?\n\n### Key Difficulties:\n1.  Given that Ludwig works 7 days a Week, We need to understand that Ludwig is getting compensated as a full day worker regardless of whether he is working half of the day in the weekend.\n   1.  The key difficult part here is interpreting if Ludwig makes any money on half of the day.\n   2.  To break this difficulty down, we can ask ourselves the question \"Does Ludwig earn any money on half of a work day?\".\n2.  Further assuming that Ludwig is paid exactly $10 per day, what is his total weekly salary? This is the key information that we need in order to compute his weekly salary.\n    1.  This is the information that is necessary to come up with the answer.\n3.  However, we do not know exactly how long Ludwig works on average.

Choices: 1. Use a solar generator. 2. Charge your phone. 3. Use a compass. 4. Use a landline. 5. Use a radio. 6. Use a ham radio. 7. Keep your phone on airplane mode.\n\n### Input\nThe radio and the cellphone only work when there is an external source of radio waves. It depends on the area that the radio's wavelength can reach. The range can only be less than 100 miles depending on how powerful your antenna is. That is also not enough for the area where there is no cell service.\n### Option 1.\nThe solar generator uses a solar panel to absorb the sunlight that the solar panel converts into electricity via a process called photosynthesis. While there may be some solar energy that can reach a place where there is no cell signal, it is not enough to power up the solar generator, let alone the cell phone, especially in places that have low light, let alone have no access to sunlight.\nOption 2.\nIf this option was correct, then it could be used to charge the cellphone. Also, the cell phone could be placed on \u201cairplane mode\u201d. \n\nOption 3. \nThis makes some sense because compasses don't need electricity. However, if you are using GPS you are not allowed to use a compass because they use an internal atomic battery. Furthermore, navigating without electricity is not possible once night falls if not", "answer": " 3,888"}

{"text": "Input is a letter that is 3 pages in length that is written to two different friends twice a week, but neither of the two friends are mentioned by name.\n\n### Rationale:As the problem requires us to determine James' yearly letter quota, we can use this information to figure out how many letters James wrote a year.\n\n### Letter to A: \n\nWe have to use each one of the given letters (2 letters) a week for four weeks (3 months). This results in 4 letters sent out to A from James each month.\n\nEach letter consists of 3 pages, and there are 4 letters from James to A that are sent each month, which equals 12 pages to A per month.\n\nMultiply this by 12 to account for the year, and the answer is 144 pages.\n\n### Now the same calculation is to be performed for Letter B:\n\nRepeat the above steps by multiplying the previous figure by the appropriate number of weeks, and dividing by 52.\n\n### The problem asks us to calculate how many pages will end up being written to B each year.\n\nThe problem gives the total number of pages, 144 pages for A and 144 pages divided by 52 for B.

A weekly quota of 72 pages to A.\n\nThe same calculation can be performed for letter B, by repeating the given steps, resulting in a weekly quota of letter B being 144 pages per week.\n\nThe total yearly quota for James should be 288 pages per week.\n### Answer\n\nThe two letters that James writes to two different friends each week, both friends get 144 pages a year, and it is given that James writes 2 letters to one friend each week which is 288 pages a week.\n\nAnswer: 288 pages\n\n### What is x if x is the length of A and B?\n\n### Answer\nA: 15 and B: 14\n\n### Explanation\nThe statement is talking about the length of two strings.

In the statement we can identify the relationship between Mina and Carlos ie. Mina memorized 18 times more than Carlos. Similarly Sam memorized 6 times more than Mina.

We cannot reasonably assume that Chelsea does not count the bags or that she does not take great care to ensure that each bag weighs the same. Thus, it is likely that each bag contains the same quantity of sugar. \n1. The question then asked us to determine the number of kilos of sugar in one of the bags after it is torn, presumably by accident. This question indicates that the amount of sugar that escapes is likely to be considerable, such as in the case of one bag becoming torn apart. \n2.

B: the half of his C: remaining ones D. E: the rest\nWe can substitute the given words into the formula to know how many he lost. 60% is 6/10.

Uneducated learners seek to apply knowledge to other domains before understanding it. These two goals lead teachers to focus on the following two strategies when teaching both uneducated and instructed students:\n1. Explicit instruction: An explicit instruction approach is one in which the teacher focuses on the structure and features of the task and the relationship of the steps. Explicit instructions will teach students exactly how to complete a task rather than teach a broad skill or learning goals. Teachers will give students detailed or explicit instructions in this approach.\n2. Relevance instruction: This type of instruction asks students to apply new or learned knowledge to a new context or a similar context. This approach seeks to make learning goals meaningful to students. Teachers instruct, guide, and support students to learn content through a real-life context. This type of instruction will teach a broad-based skill or learning goals.\nRelevance instruction focuses on having the learner focus on meaningful outcomes (i.e. understanding the importance of their content knowledge).", "answer": " 7"}

This gives the time-requirement of half an hour for clothes.\nSecondly, we need to work the time it takes to the sheets.\nFrom the information given, we know that the sheets take 15 less time to wash that the towels. \nBecause it takes Naomi only 30 minutes to do clothes, she would need to wash the sheets 15 minutes less than she was the clothes. \nTherefore, the remaining time would be fifteen minutes.\nNow, we know the total amount of minutes needed to wash the 3 piles.\n### Response:5 minutes\nBecause the total hours needed for Naomi to washing everything is 15 minutes.\n\n### Demo:\nInput:The lab results had been compiled?

The number of cookies Uncle Jude bakes is 253. We are also informed that he baked some more cookies. That information leads us to believe that this is the exact number of cookies he put in the frige leaving the exact total for the 69 cookies he gave out. As such Mike got 23 of the cookies left over.\nThis leaves us with 43 cookies left and we want to know how many of these cookies Uncle Jude put in the fridge. To do this we need to determine how many he gave to Tim, the number of cookies he gave to Mike after giving the same number to Tim but how about Anna?\n\nWe determine that Tim received 6 cookies and therefore that means that Anna must have received 6/9 of the 43 cookies left over. Thus Anna received 21/9th of the cookies, but how many did Jude give Mike to make it 6/9 in total? \n\nWe can determine that Mike must have received 26/15ths of the remaining cookies.\nTo determine how many were used by Mike we first find out what fraction of the cookies was given to Tim, since Tim got a greater share of the cookies, he must have received a larger fraction of the cookies. Since Mike received twice as many cookies as was given to Tim, he must have received the fraction of the cookies 2/15ths.\n\nTherefore the total number of cookies Mike received is: 20 + 10 + 1/9ths = 26/10.\n\nWe know", "answer": " 188"}

This means that each book costs $10 (20 X 1/2). \nTherefore, with each customer buying two books, the total cost to a customer is $20 (10 X 2).\n\n\nSince the goal is to earn a $120, the customer must sell a total of 12 books; he earns a $120 with the sale of 12 books.\n\n\n### Response 2:\nThe answer to the question is \"12 books.\" The explanation is in the following three paragraphs.\n\nThe first paragraph explains that the total cost of a book is $10, and the total cost to the customer is $20. The total cost to the customer, however, is derived from the total cost of each book multiplied by the number of books the \ncustomer purchased. When the consumer pays a total cost of $20, it is for the purchase of 2 books. \n\nThe second paragraph states that Tina needs to sell a total of 6 books in order to earn a profit of $120.

At the same time, a lot of teachers still struggle with their writing. Some don\u2019t bother using standard spelling, for they cannot control the students\u2019 understanding (Abu, 2012). If I were the teacher, I will make sure my students understood how to construct paragraphs by giving a clear guideline or instructions on how to write good paragraphs. For example, I will explain the purpose and structure of paragraphs to them and give them some practice. After I have explained it to them, I will give them a writing task and ask them to practice it. After they understand how to write paragraphs, I will be able to ensure that there are no problems with the teacher\u2019s writing. I will work on my grammar skills, too (Campbell, 1995).\u201d\n```\n\n### Demostration video\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/1sx930xt5482d2c/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-08%20at%205.40.13%20PM.png?dl=0\n\n### Answer\n\n```\n(Abu, 22/6/2012)\n\u201cTo ensure that students understading the task, I will give them more support on how to construct paragraphs and at the same time teachers still struggle with their own skills in writing.

{"text": "1. The instructions for the assignment include a scenario involving a baking contest that ate people voted for cakes.\n2. The instructions provide the number of votes that were cast for the three cakes present in the competition, and ask that we calculate the number of votes cast for each cake. \n3. In order to answer the question, we need to find the number of votes cast total, then subtract the total number of votes for both cakes that received fewer votes than the cake with the most votes. 4. There were three different cakes in the competition, and they have been sorted in order from most to few number of votes, and the question asks us to calculate the total number of votes. \n5. To that end, we can create a table to write down what we know, and from which we can find the total votes easily. \n6. We start with making a table that includes all of the necessary information, like the given choices. \n7. We use a tally for each cake, one for the unicorn, one for the dragon and one for the witch. Then, write down the information from the scenario in the rows below the table. \n8. 9. In order to calculate the numbers of votes cast for each, we multiply the tally by the number that corresponds to that cake in the row below the tally. \n9. We multiply the tally for the witch by the first number 7 to give us the amount of votes cast for the witch, then we multiply the tally for dragon by the number 8 to give us the amount voted for the dragon cash.  These numbers are listed in the third column, from right to left. 10.

The question presents the scenario of how many boxes Tanika\u2019s scout troop sold on Saturday and Sunday.2. After gathering the data, it states that Tanika sold 60 boxes on Saturday and sold 50% on Sunday.3. We need to find the total number of boxes sold in two days.4. We can set up the problem using the given information.5. On Saturday, Tanika sold 6 boxes. On Sunday, Tanika sold 50% of the volume of crackers she sold on Saturday, that is, 6 boxes.6. Therefore, we can find the solution.\n\n### Solution:On Saturday (Saturday's total crackers' number sold = 6; crackers number per day = 6 ; day of day = Saturday; crackers day of day = x; crackers day of month = - ; )7. After solving for the crackers by subtracting from Saturday\u2019s crackers number by 6, we get x = 6, and x = 6.8.

{"text": "Answer the given question.\n\n## Rationale: \n\n### Input(2):What\u2019s the largest prime number under 7? Enter the answer as a single integer: What is the Largest prime number less than seven.  \nInput:What\u2019s the largest Prime number under 7? Answer: \n\n## Rationale(2):\n\n1. the above problem is trying to identify the largest prime number below 7. \n\n### Example: \n\n1. The example was to identify the largest prime below 7. So we start by listing all numbers below 7, noting that 1 is not prime.\n\n2. 2,3,5,7\n\n3. Now we can see that it is either 2 or 5 which is prime. But to identify which number is prime, we can check to see if it is divisible by any of the numbers that are prime above 7, which in this case it is not prime. \n\n4. Therefore, the largest prime under 7 is 5.\n\n5. So the larger version of this problem is to check for all the remaining prime numbers above 7. So we need to check all the numbers that are below 6 because we already checked the numbers 7-6. The prime numbers 6-14 are 2,3,4,5,7,21,8,9,11,13,19.\n\n6. This leaves us with only 3 prime numbers remaining, 19,21, and 29.\n\n7. Since 29 cannot be less than 7, only 19 and 21 are left which we can do a similar process for them.\n\n8. Therefore we have 3 prime numbers below 7, so the answer must be 3.\n\n8. However, an alternative answer on the same question would be 0. Which represents all the numbers under 7 that are odd or are prime. \n\n9. By checking all the numbers that are odd, we are able to see that the number 3 cannot be divisible by 1 or 3 (which are prime).\n\n10.

{"text": "Demonstration: The question requires us to find out the value of the variable t after 2 nights. In this solution, we assume 2 nights to be 12 days or 96 hours based on 24 hours a day. We use the variables n (n = 5) for the number of people who became vampires on each night and v (v = X) for the number of vampires at the end of the night after X nights. \n\nThe question can be seen as a set starting with 2 vampires initially. For each day, 5 people become vampires, and this process continues. This way, every 24 hours, the total number of people who are vampires increases by 5 (because it takes 24 hours for there to be another day).\n\nHence, n = 5 on day 1 or 1 night, and v = 2 on day 1 or night 1.\n\nLet's assume n = 5 and v = 2. We need to find what v = 7 means on day 2 or night 2. For this, we need to consider all possibilities for n = 7 and see how many ways we get 2 vampires and how many ways we get more than 2 vampires. In this case, there is only one way that n = 7 leads to 2 vampires (because there is one way to get just 2 vampires from n = 7 and 7 - 2 ways of getting more vampires with 7 people). Since we have a total number of ways in which we can get 2 vampire with any number of 5 people (n = 5 + 1) leading to 2 vampire (v = 1, 2, etc. starting from n = 4 + 1), there will be a total of n(n - 1) - 1 ways to get 2 vampiric people at the same time, including 1 way to get 2 vamprs plus one additional way.

We also need to remember that if we start with a number less than 1, we need to multiply and keep a remainder. And if we start with a larger number, we need to do the opposite: we divide and keep a remainder. The remainder means that there was some left over, and some of number was divided. So if the divisor is a negative number, there you might need to multiply and keep the remainder, or if it\u2019s a positive number, then you can do the opposite: divide a remainder.\n\n### Suppose we have 50 chocolate bars, and we split them.

Which compound changes more quickly in volume? Choices: \n\n#### A: The volume of compound A is changing because the area of the smaller rectangle decreases.\n\nThe volume of compound A decreases because the area of the rectangle where the compound is being measured is decreasing. \n\n#### B: The volume of compounds B is changing because the area increases. \n\n\n#### C: Both compounds' volumes are changing, but one is changing faster than the other. \n\nIn compound A both the area and volume of the compound decrease. \n\nIn the compound B, the area of the compound increases therefore, creating a greater volume. \n\nBoth, compound A and B are changing volumes. \n\nIn this case where the scientists measure the volume of compounds A and B, the rate of change of volume for compound A is greater than the rate of change of the volume for compound B.\n\nIn this case of measurement, the compound whose volume increases more rapidly is compound B.

Therefore Roque takes 5 + 2 = 7 hours to and from work place using all modes of transportation a week.\n\n### Explanation:\nInput: Firstly, the question specifies that Roque takes 2 hours walking to work and an hour biking to work once a week. We can rule out A: Walking once a day and B: Walking twice a day as walking twice a day would take 1 hour so there is a discrepancy of 1 hour between the scenario and the choices, so these are not correct. \n\nInput: The question then states that Roque walks and bikes to and from his work 3 and 2 respectively, for a total of 5 hours in all. \n\nInput It also takes Roque 2+ 2+ 1 = 5 (driving twice a week) which makes a total of 7 hours a week to and from his work, with all modes of transport.\n\nAnswer: A: Walking once day B: Walking twice day C: walkig once week \n\nExplanation: Driving Bicycling Walking is one option because Bicycling means bike is used more than once, in the answer it says that Roque bicycles twice a week which equals to 2 hours, so total would be 3 +", "answer": " 16"}

Given a scenario where 40 people are attending the meeting, we set it up in this way:\n\t1.

Thus we know that John has at least 60 roommates. \nIn order to find the number of roommates, we multiply 60 by 2 and Bob has 10 of them which means that we have 60+10=70.

If there are 3girls, how many boys are there.\n### Response:\nBy comparing the wording of the question, we know that there is at least 3/2 more boys than girls. To find the number of girls we divide 20 by 3. Substituting 20 for n and 3 for d: 20/3= and then we multiply 3*n and 6*n to get 12+18=30.

Then we can multiply it with quantity for both milk(3) and cereal(5). 2. Cereal was sold at discount of $1; so the discount is  -$1. Therefore, we will buy milk at $2 and save $1. Next, we multiply it with 5 for cereal. 3.

{"text": "The problem is set out as a mathematical question where two students will read a book for a school project.\n\nThe first choice presented is that \"Emery can read five times faster than Serena, and the same book will take her 20 days because the book can only take him 10 days to complete. So we have, a 1 : 5 ratio of time. \n\nNext, we have to find the answer to the question of how many days it will take the two students to read the book.\n\nTo get the answer, we need to simplify and understand the problem in more depth.\n\nThe 1:5 ratio is telling us that for every 1 day Serena spends on the book, Emery will spend only 5 days and so on. With this in mind, \n\nWhat we are trying to understand at this point is the number of days between the two students to complete this project.\n\nWhen we multiply 20 by 5, what we get is 100. We can infer from this conclusion that Emery will take 50 days to finish 100 and so Serena will be left with 10 days to finish what is left. If the two students were to divide the same book between themselves, Serena will be left to take 10 days of the 20, but as we know, she will already be on the same day (day 10) and so she has no time left, because she has already used up all of the time given to her to read it. \n\nThe answer of how long it took the two of them can be said to be the total number of days taken divided by 2, which is 1 day per person.\n\n### Input (Example)\n\nThe problem outlines the scenario where two classmates have to read a book for their class project, and Serena can read five times faster as Emery and will need about 20 days to complete the book and on the same note, it tells us that Emery will need about 10 days to read the book. \n\n### Response\n\nThe question of whether or not students will be able to complete their assigned homework in time can be answered by using the following method. \nThe classwork usually is designed to benefit the students in some way, but it also often leaves students with more work after school hours.", "answer": " 60"}
{"text": "### Demo:\nInput: A man gives the cashier with 1 quarter and 2 dimes $1.30, how many nickels will he get back?\nOutput: It will depend on which denomination he gave as it will determine how many nickels \nwe will return. \nRationale: In this problem, the man is giving the cashier $1.30 and a single dime has 10 cents value and the cashier has a one quarter and two dimes (0.25 and 0.10) which make it so that it equals 1.30.\nIn this problem, It will depend on which 2 denomination given to the cashier because it will determine how many \nnickels we will return. \nThe man gives the cashiers 1 quarter and the man gives 2 dimes so the total sum of casher is 31 cents. Then the man will get back 29 cents since he gives 31 cents in total; since 31 cents - 1 cent = 28 cents and 28 cents + 1 cent = 30 cents, 30 cents divided by 2 is 15 cents since the man will be refunded 29 cents.\n\n### Demo 2:\nInput: The cashier has a quarter, five dimes, 10 nickels, and two pennies. You give the cashier 50 cents. \nHow many nickels do you get in change?\nOutput: How many nickels do we get in change; there is 10 nickels in the money box so we give the cashier back 30 cents, 30 cents /10 cents is 3 so we give back 30 ctens = 3 nickels.\n\n### Rationale: You calculate the problem by counting the number of pennies and the number of nickels. In this problem.\nthere are 10 nickels and 9 pennies in the money box. If you give the cashier with a quarter, and five dimes and you get back 50 cents then there will be 10 pennies and 2 nickels.

At some point, on the day of the trip, the number of boys and girls was the same due to the absence of some girls. The task here is to calculate the number of girls who were absent.\n\nTo answer this question we need to determine how many girls there were in total, and then determine how many there were at the time of the field trip. We can use the rule of thumb: add the boys and subtract the girls to determine the final figure. We can then calculate the answer.\n\nBased on the question, there are 18 students total, and 8 students are boys. Therefore they number of girls is 10. On field trip day, there are eight boys remaining (the other 10 are girls). We can use this information to calculate the answer with the simple rule of thumb: (8+10)-8=2.

{"text": "Each book costs 22.667 dollars.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. First, we must find the number of books purchased. We do this by subtracting the number of funds left over after purchasing the six books from the given number of dollars \n2. Next, we must find the average cost of each book. We do this using the formula \u201cnumber of books / number of dollars * 100\u201d. This gives us 14 dollars / 6 + 0 * 100 = 22.67 dollars.\n3. Thus, each book costs 22 dollars.\n4. Another way to solve this is to figure out the number of books, divide the number of dollars left by that number, and multiply the result by 100 to come to the answer. \n   - The first step would be to figure out the number or books purchased after Fred spent all his money.\n   - If we have to spend $236 on 6 books, and we are left with $14, our number of books is 14, and we can do some simple division to solve for that. \n   - We can divide 236 by 14 to get a number of books of 17.350. \n   - Because we don\u2019t need a perfect number of books, we\u2019ll round it up to 18. \n   - Now we need to multiply our number of dollars by our number of books to find the number of dollars spent on books. \n   - $236 * 18 = $4312. \n   - To find what percentage we spent on the books, we use the formula 100 * 42 / 236 = 119.150 % \n   - When you multiply this by 100, we get back to the desired answer\u2014we spent 119-1/2 percent of our money on books!\n\n\n### Exercises:\n1.

{"text": "He bought 9 boxes of oranges\n\n### Rationales\n\nInput and Output: The question starts with the phrase \"Seth bought some boxes....\" We start numbering the boxes. We can then deduce from the numbering that Seth gave away half of his remaining boxes. We can also infer that the amount of left boxes is half of the amount of original boxes, and that the remainder of the original boxes was given away.\nAnswer: Seth would have bought 9 boxes of orange. The math in the question comes from the way we are numbering the boxes and the fact that half of the original amount was given away. Let the number of original boxes be x, then the number of boxes he gave away was x/2 or x/2 + 1. But x +x = 2x, so x + x/2 = 2x/2, and as x/2 = x - x/2 = x/2 +1 = 2x/4 we conclude that he has 2x/4 -2x/2  = x/4  left.

How did the number of pigeons seen the day before affect his sleep? Explain.\n\n### Response\n\nThe number of pigeons did not affect his sleep.\n\n### Rationale\n\nWe can read a lot of the context clues in the question. It says that pigeons were flying towards him, so we can assume pigeons were near him. That means that pigeons were likely not flying towards him because they were attacking him. Next it says that \"but that night, he slept better.\" We can infer that there wasn't any danger from the pigeons that night. Finally, it says \"the next morning, he walked to town. \" We can also infer that he was walking home. It likely would not have required a very long walk if it was not dangerous or if he wanted to be there the next day. Therefore, the pigeons did not directly affect his sleep.", "answer": " 9"}

Choices: A: 1200 B: 1800 C: 1100 D: 1900 E: 1000\nRationales:\n1. The problem presents us with a scenario where John drinks 3 energy beverages with varying levels each. \n2. The question asks how much pure caffeined John consumed, not how much caffeine in general. \n3. We need to be able to quantify how much caffeined John consumes. \n4. We need to consider the amount of caffeine in each portion as a percentage and then calculate how much pure caffeinated John consumed. \n5. From the information we have, we can use the following:\n\nTotal caffeine in all 3 energy drinks:2500 grams\nSecond Drink - 1000 grams per ounce\nThird drink - 100 grams per oz\n6. We should multiply the energy drink portion by its percentage to get the total percentage of pure caffeined consumed by John.\na. The first energy drink has 12 oz with a 500 grams of pure caffeination. \nb. Second drink has 2 ounce but has 1000mg of pure caffeinated in one ounce. \nc.

I have to show them how to get to the solution and not just read it off to them.  \n\n### Input\nTanya\u2019s mom bought two $5 lottery tickets and one $10 lottery ticket. The odds of winning the $10 jackpot are 500,000 to 1. How likely is it that Tanya\u2019s mom wins the jackpot?\n\n### Demostration\n- The mom buys two five dollar lotery tickets and one ten dollar lottery ticket. The jackpot is 500, 000. The odds are 500000, one. Then divide the two of them to one ten and you get five.  Rationales:\n\n-The number of different ways of choosing two items from a list of three is.\n\n* The number of items in the list (here, it is 3) * the number of orders (3*2) =12\n\n-So you have a choice of 12 ways of choosing two items. I want to know Tanya\u2019s mom\u2019s odds of buying those two items;\n\nTanya\u2019s Mom is one of twelve. If I take a number and divide it by a whole number and I am left with no remainder, that means there is a good chance there is a positive answer.\nExample: 240/ 20 =20 (No Remainder)", "answer": " 52"}

The goal is essentially to work out how much money in cents was placed in the pond as a whole, considering that the 5 people are all throwing different types of coins.\nSo, we take the values of the coins that each of the people threw into the pond, and add this value for each individual person to find out the total amount of money, which we represent  by money placed in cents). As for example, if someone threw in a nickel, then  we multiply the value of the nickels by the number of nickels thrown in and find out the total amount to be placed in cents, which we record as, where  is the total amount of money in nickels. As for example, if the value of a nickel is 5 cents, and if 60 nickels were thrown into the pond, then the final value is,  which is the sum of all the individual nickel coins as per the example.\nThis problem is not particularly difficult. We can use an array or a set to represent the value of each coin as it gets thrown, and then we take this value to compute the overall total money placed into the pond in cents.\nAn outline of how we solve this problem would be : 1. Take a value and multiply it by the quantity of that coin in the pond to get the total value in cents for the particular coin, as, for example, in the case of a nickel where the total money is, 2. We now store the total amount of money placed in cents in a sum variable and then repeat the procedure to compute the values of each remaining type of coin, as 3. We will compute the total money placed in cents until we exhaust all types of coins, as in the case of a dime, a quarter, 3 quarters, 8 nickels, Ivy's 60 pennys thrown into the pond.\n\n### Response Rationale:\nThe response accurately implements the steps of the algorithm to obtain the desired answer.\n\n### Reference", "answer": " 200"}

{"text": "The question asked for the total number of spokes, and not the individual amount of spokes for each wheel. It should have asked how many spokes did the bicycle have, not \"wheel\"\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question asked for the number of spokes on the bicycle, but the answer given listed the number of spokes for each individual wheel. The amount of spokes on the front and back wheels could differ and be accounted for by specifying a different number of spokes on each wheel. \n\n2. The question itself indicates that the individual amount of spkes for each wheel is not relevant in the context of the problem, but it is only the number of spokes across both wheels that is required. \n\n3. The number of spokes on both wheels does not alter based on whether it is the front or back wheel, so it is not specified that each set of given spokes should total 20 or a different even number. This means that we don't know if the back wheel has more spokes to total 40 or 42. Even if we take that into account, it is unneccesary to calculate this individually for the front and back wheel. \n\n4. This is not a maths problem but instead a simple logic problem to determine how many possible answers there would be if you were to only use the given information to calculate the total value, and 40 spokes is indeed the only possible answer. \n\n### Input : 6-year-old Timmy is driving a car and wants to go to the playground.

{"text": "Input:We only know there were 40 birds in the cage, so each bird can represent one quarter of the total.\n\nDemonsration:\n\nRationales:\n1. This is an open-ended task that requires a sequence of number operations and a little bit of arithmetic.\n2. It requires us to reason logically, so that we can identify what to do from the information that is provided.\n3. We can first simplify the question by reasoning that since there are six more birds next to the cage than grey birds, there are six times the number of white birds in the cage as the total number of birds.\n4. Because six times the total number of birds is equal to the total number of white birds, we can rewrite the problem to simplify it further by stating that: 6 \u00d7 56 = 56 \u2007 (40 \u2013 10).\n5. We know, therefore, that there are approximately 33% as many white birds in the caged as there are black birds. So, 6 \u00d7 50 = 50 \u2007 (56 \u2013 16).\n6. We can conclude from this that the total number of birds in the cage must now be equal to 2/3 of the original total (i.e. 56 \u2013 10). We can then represent this as 56 \u2013 4 = 24.\n\nRationales 7: Now that we have this information, we can go on and determine the total number of birds that are left in the cage after 10 minutes.\n\n8: We can write: 40 \u2013 16 = 24 and 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n9: We now have 34 birds that remain in the cage after the ten minutes have passed. If one third of them are let out and away, we have 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 birds remaining. \n\n10: There are two more birds in the cage after ten minutes than when they started.\n\n11: So, there are 72 + 2 = 74 birds in the cage in total at the end of the ten minutes.\n\n### Input:\"You are a member of the New York Police Department.

We are given to know that Joe's team was competing with other teams for the first-place trophy, and they played each other team one game each.\n3. It's stated the first-place team has played its first game which yielded a loss and a tie result and then Joe's team played their first game which yielded the same result. \n4. We are told that Joe's team has played another two games against the first-place team. \n5. This indicates that we already know that the first-place team lost one of their games and tied the other one during their first game.\n6.

Multiplying 96 by 3 gives us 288, and from that 96 and 288 added together give us 384. So far we have 384, and we double it to get 768.\n\n- Now using the extra data(boxes of cookies & jars of jam), we multiply 14 times two to equal 28, and 2 boxes times 2 to equal 4, and we add the two pieces of cheese by adding two of the six to us it.\n\n- So, we add 384 + 28 + 4 + 16", "answer": " 16"}

If one thinks about it; this is a basic requirement of our country, isn\u2019t it? In order to succeed, we must unite all of the people in our country and get them to stand together as one. To begin with, there are some people, like the young voters, that have no representation in Congress. Voting should be changed to include our young people. The Constitution does not allow this directly, but if the President and/or Congress were to propose such a change, it could be passed quickly and directly. After this, the President could send such an effort directly to Congress and to the states. This will open the doors for people who feel they are being ignored. If there were a voting age of 16, the number of voters would soar. This is because the youth of our nation, who have no representation, can now be represented directly. Secondly, there is a system now that has developed that some say has gone too far. Those who are wealthy enough will receive a great amount in donations through television, ads, and other sources. This is something that should be stopped. The wealthy people use their wealth in these ways to influence the election in favor of themselves and/or their party. The poor, less informed people vote in what they think their candidate is saying rather than what they think they want. Now, many people are not as well-informed and can only listen to what their television tells them.

So the time it takes to download 60 megabyte is 60*5/5 or 120 seconds. \n  The speed will increase to 10 megabyte/second once we hit the 60 megabyter.

The dimensions of the living room rectangle are 4 feet by 6 feet. We can easily find the amount of inches per foot by dividing the 6 inches into the 6 feet, which gives us 3 inches per foot. \n3. The dimensions of the bedroom rectangle are 2 feet by 4 feet. Once again, we can find the inches per foot by diving the 4 into the 4 feet, which give us 4 inches per foot. 4. When we know that a linear unit is 12 inches, it's easier to measure the amount of material left in square feet. \n5. The living room rectangle is 4 feet by 4 feet per square. \n6. The bedroom rectangle is 2 feet by 2 feet per square. 7. As we divide the length of the bolt by these dimensions, we learn that the bolt length is twice as long as the living room rectangle. 8.

{"text": "(2/3)*3+10 + (1/(3))*4 = 9 2/3\n\n### Rationale:\n1. We know that Jesse and Mia are each running 30 miles.\n2. We're told that they have one week to complete this, and so if we divide the 30 miles between the two, we get 15 miles each.\n3. We can't run 15 miles a day every day, and so we need to figure out their average mileage per day over the whole week.\n4. This tells us that Jesse ran 15/6 of a mile a day on the first 3 days, and on day 4 she ran 15 miles.\n5. Mia ran 10 miles a day over the 4 days before the final 3.\n6. In response to these, we need to determine the average of their combined average.\n7. To find the combined average for Mia and Jesse, we calculate the sum of their averages over the first 4  days (Jesse's, and Mia's for the first 4 days) and divide that by the total.\n   8. We calculate the sum of this as (15/6)4 + (10/6)4, add the two together, and then divide by 4.\n    - this means multiplying 15 and 10 by 6 (to get the total of milies/day, because we're doing 6 day averages, and then adding them, because we're combining 2 averages.)\n9. We then get 9 2/9\n10. Now looking at the second part of the problem, we know that Mia and Jesse need to run a total of 30 miles. They've run that already, so we need to subtract the 30 miles from what they've already run.\n11. Our new equation becomes (9 2/9) - 30 (since we want to get their average for the next 3 days, we take away the 30 from what they've run already.)\n12. This would then be (9 2/3).", "answer": " 6"}

The problem gives a specific number of quarters, which we will need to transform into a different type of coin for it to be appropriate.\n2. The person who has the quarters wants to exchange them for something else.\n\n### InputThe problem is not stated to include a specific question, but a description of a scenario.\n\n### Response\nIn response to the problem, we will need to take the amount of quarters given and convert it into the amount of the other type of coin that the individual wants.\n\n1. The amount of quarters, which is 20, would be converted to the equivalent amount of nickels, as this is the type of coin that the person needs.\n2. We know that the value of two quarters is the equivalent of one nickel.\n3. We can therefore divide the total number of quarters by two to find the equivalent in nickels.\nNickels = 20 Quarters/2\nNickels =10\n\n3. Next, we need to determine the value of the nickels in order to find out the amount the person should receive.\n4.

The answer options presented A: 65.6, B: 62, C: 68.3 and D: 62.3 are greater than the correct answer. There is an option present 68.7 however this option is incorrect as the dune buggy cannot ride faster than 68.7 when it can ride slower than 68.3.

{"text": "Input: The poultry farm has a total of 300 chicken, 80 guinea, and 200 turkey which is three hundred chicken, eighty guinea, and two hundred turkey.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. We begin with an introduction of what a small farm has.\n2. The farm suffers from incubation, incurable disease, we can therefore identify the problems.\n3. Then the statement is that everyday lost twenty birds: twenty chickens, eight turkeys and five guinea fowls, the birds lost are identified.\n4. From the statement above, we can infer that the lost amount of birds is recorded, we then have the following table of birds left in the farm.\n5. The lost of birds in the farm is; total lost of chicken bird = (300 x 20).\n6. The lost of birds, turkeys = (80 x 8).\n7. The lost of birds = (200 x 5).\n8. From the table above, we can identify the left amount of birds based on that formula. \n9. So 300 - (300 x20) = 340,\n10. 80 - (80 x8) = 72\n11. 200 - (200 x5) = 190\n12. After a week, we can identify the following birds left in the poultery.\n13.

{"text": "There are 56 more children than adults.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question states that church has 12 members made up of adults and children.\n2. It then further states that 40% are made up of adults, this means that there is 80% that are children. \n3. To calculate the number of children, we first multiply 120 by the percentage of children, which gives us 48, because there are 40% children. \n4. Thus, 48, is the number of children. The number of adults, in this case, cannot be found by subtraction and can be calculated.\n5. To calculate the number adults, we do the following.\n6. We multiply 120 times 100% which gives us 1200, but this is not the end, because we are still working with a percent, and not a decimal. \n7. After this, we divide the number of children by the number of adults, by subtracting it. \n8. This is because 48 is already the number of children so we are dividing by itself, to get the number of adults. \n9.

We move the x exponent to the right hand side, giving us\n$$x^2+y^8=2y^3$$    \n4. Multiplying both sides by y^4, gives\n$$y^4(x^2+y)^8=(y^2)(y^3)$$\n5. Moving x, from the denomin", "answer": " 24"}

Marks gotten by 50 students 19, 23, and 37. Marks obtained by another 17 students 35, 48, 15, 15\nRationales:1. In order to answer this question we have to decide whose marks are being discussed. The first thing we have to do is check if any of the students have a name that ends in an s. 2. Since the options do not include s I assume that the marks are obtained by random other students. 3. We see that there are 50 students with the highest obtained marks being 37 and the lowest mark being 19. The next 15 students have the highest marks being 15 and the lowest mark being15. The first and last students are said to be at the extreme left and extreme right respectively of the distribution. 4. This leaves us with 17 students who fall in between the extremes. 5. We are asked to find the missing value by taking the median value of one of the groups. 6. For the set of extreme left, the median is equal to the third lowest value which is 23. Since the option of the answer includes the value of 19 it cannot be correct. 7. For the set of extra right, the median is equal the third lowest value which it 15.Since the option of the answer is 35, it cannot be correct. The right most 15 students do not have any value as a median. 8. We are left with calculating the median value of 17 students 5(15+23)+19. 9. It's a known fact that the median of an unordered collection of 4 or more data is always even. Therefore, the median of 17 is 22.

However, it doesn't immediately state how many in total have read.\n3. To answer this question, we need to first understand their total reads and to do that, we'll have to get how many have each person read in total.\n4. We can break down the numbers into 2 parts.  Kelcie has only read 1/4 of Megan's 32.  Let X represent the total books Kelcie has read and X/4 represents the books that Megan has.\n5.  So we can substitute this into the answer.\n      (1/4) * 32 = x\n      therefore x = 32 x 4/1\n      x= 128\n6. Greg has read 9 times more than twice Megan's reads (32).

The question contains the word 5, which corresponds to Earl heading down 2 floors from his starting position on the first floor, to the 5th floor. \n\n2. If we assume that Earl is now on the 5th floor, then, the scenario will look like the following:\n\n![](./images/923d346.jpg)\n\n3. If we notice, Earl is now on the fifth floor of a building. On the fifth floor, Earl will go up 2 floors to the seventh floor.\n\n4. There are a total of 7 floors between the fifth and seventh levels. Thus, we know that Earl has 7 levels left to go.\n\n5. We know that Earl started on the first floor of this building. We also know that Earl was on the fifth floor, which is 4 levels below the top of this building. This means that Earl has 4 floors left to go.\n6. Therefore, Earl has 7 level remaining. He will be on the seventh floor when he completed his deliveries, and will go up 4 levels above the top of the building, where he will be on the 11th floor. \n7. Earl has 11 floors left to go which is 3 floors below the top floor. \n8. Thus, the total number of floors in the building is 9 floors, which is the same as the total floor count if we subtract 3 from  11.

The question states that Maggie picked 40, Kelsey picked 68, and Layla picked some. There are no specifics given about Layla's apples except the fact that she picked some.\n3. The question states that the three averaged 35, meaning that by themselves, Maggie and Kelsey each picked 30, and when added up with Layla, 30 + 10 + 68 = 98. The question also states that Layla picked an average of 12. \n4. Since Layla has an average of 10 + 12 = 22 apples, option 4 is correct as two-thirds (of our 98 or 98/2) = 63 apples and 10 + 22 = 32, which is less than 35, meaning option 4 is correct.\n5.

This means that 87% of scores above 86 were above that score.\n\nContinuing down the list of scores, we can see that there are no scores above 87.

To express this mathematically, Georgie needs to multiply the servings that she already has (5 avocados) with the number of servings available (4 avocados).\n5.

{"text": "#### Methods and Explanation:\nFirst, I need to set up this problem in math form. We will use the equation $x = \\frac{5 \\times 60}{60 \\times 10}$ and the units in this equation are miles per hour. This can be rearranged like this: $\\frac{5}{6} x = 1$ because x is the rate Marcos went during the 10 minutes, or the distance he would travel in 10 minutes. We know Marcos needed to go a mile 6 times in 10 minutes, as the equation says to get across the 5 mile lake in 10 minutes we must go 6 miles per 10 minutes. So we know x = 1 because x= $\\frac{5}{ (6)}$ and x is not equal to 1 and so 1 = x. The answer is Marcos needed to go 1 mile per 10 minutes and his speed was 1 mile per hour. He needed to go 11 mphs, $\\frac{11}{1}$, 11mphs would be $6.15$ mphs if the units are set in feet. The miles per hour is $\\frac{5 \\times60}{60\\times10} = 1$.", "answer": " 30"}

The problem presents 2 scenarios.\n2. They provide us with a question which is based on the 2nd scenario.\n3. Both the scenarios need to be understood to give us an answer.\n4. The man went on a swimming-run and covered the distance of 7 miles, swimming for 2 hours at 2 miles per hour and running for half of the time, at the speed of 4 times the speed of his speed while swimming.\n5. This means that the speed at his peak, while running, was 8 miles per hour.\n6. This means that each minute, he ran for 0.0625 miles at 8 miles per hour, or for 0.04 times the speed of swimming, at a speed of 4 times of swimming speed.\n7. With this in mind, it is easy to answer that, in one hour, he ran for 6.25 times the distance covered while swimming.\n8. Thus, with swimming and running speed both in effect, he covered a total distance of 6.25 miles, i.e. half the time was spent running at a speed of 8 miles per hour for 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n9.

{"text": "Input:A zoo has a certain amount of parrots, snakes, monkeys, elephants and zebras. The zoo has 8 parrot, meaning there are 16 lesser parrow than 8, which means that parrot account for more than half the animals in the zoo, and this is true that 16 is the half of 8, which is 16/4=4, meaning there are four parrows to the zoo. From here we have 4 more parrots, therefore subtract 4 from the number of parrows in the zoo, which will leave us with 4. As for snakes, the zoo has twice the number of parrotd, and the zoo has three times the number of snaking as it does the number of parroads, therefore there are 4+8+ 16=349 snakes, 349-2=347. As for monkeys, the zoo has half the number of snakes and elephants, which has 14 of them, meaning that parrots are almost exactly 14 less than the 14 elephants, and 14-16=2 and therefore this leaves the parrots 2 more than elephants, whereas the snakes are more than the elephants, therefore snakes = elephants. The difference in number between the remaining Zebras and elephants. Difference between Zebrabs and Elephants=23-20=3. Therefore, the zoo has a total 351 monkeys.

{"text": "Answer: 3 bags\n\nRationale:The given question is asking about the amount of profit a farmer ought to make on a sale, and the calculation to make such a profit is expressed in terms of a 10% return. Thus, 10% of 10, which is 1, is subtracted from 30 to yield 29. And 29 is divided by 10 to yield 2.90, which is rounded down to 2. Thus, the profit is 0.20. Since this 0.20 is a fractional amount, it should be converted into a dollar value to provide a clear understanding. To do this, we move the decimal to the right four places, making 5.2%, or 52/1000. 0.20 would equal 0.04, which would be rounded to 0.05. Therefore, the profit is $ 0.05 \u00d7 50 = $ 2.50.

{"text": "1.  Answer: The answer is 6 gallons.\n2. Rationales: 1) Input: One gallon of paint can can cover 60 feet of a wall. 2) The walls in the living-room take 600 square fetes. 3) Three bedrooms take up 40 square feet each. If we assume they each are 6 feet in height. 4) Paint can cover more than one wall so you have to do a multiplication instead of division. 5) Input: Each bedroom wall needs 400 squarefeet to cover and each gallon of paint covers 600 squarefeet. Then the gallons= number of times the first number gets divided into the second number, which means 400/600= 400/=5 so 400/5 = 80 and 5x80= 40, which means 4 x 25 = 100. 6) So, 100/60 = 5/6  and you do 6x5= 30 and you subtract the 30 from the 80.

The formula consists of 6 terms. The first two terms was: (a+b) divided by (b-a). The next three terms were: c^2, d^2, and e^2. The final term was: f times (-1/3)^g divided by (-1/4)^h. He was also given a list of numbers he is supposed to substitute in order to solve the problem, that list is as follows: a = 3, b = 1, c = -5, d = 2, e = 1, f = -2, g = 4, and h = 3. He then solved all the math. He was able to find all the numbers substituting them according to the order of the list. He has already found each of the 6 terms. According to the list, he found the first two terms: (3+1) divided by (1-3) = 2/2. For the 3rd term, he used an approximation, he approximated 5^2 = 25, then approximate the 4th term he approximated 2^2 = 4, he approximated the 5th term he approximated -1/2^2 = -1/4, the final term was: (1/3)^(4/3) divided by (-1/2)^(3/2). Using approximations, he then approximated as follows: 3^6 * 4/9 = 1.97, 4^6 * 9/4 = 2.94, (-1/2)^3 was approximated to 0.6, and -1/3 was approximated to -0.3333.

This variable will always be less than the 'problem_count'(which is the total number to solve). This is because there could be more than 2 successful hit to every ball sent. The number that failed will be found through the variable 'failure' which is basically the 'problem_count - success'.\n\nFrom the above information (or from the information passed), the 'average'", "answer": " 110"}

The average is calculated by dividing the total of the values in the sequence by its total number. In this case, the average is a value that represents the middle of the values, and represents the average of the entire sequence.

Choices: 1) x2 y2 z2, 2) yzxz2, 3) yz2, 4) yz\n\nDemonstration: 1. We have the situation where the number of girls is the sum of the number boys.\n2. We'll break the number of girls into two parts which are the number of boys and the number of girls.\n3. So, if the first number is x (which represents the number of boys), Then the second number is y, which represents the number of girls. \n4. We can use the Distributitivity Principle to break the number of girls down into the the sum of the numbered of boys.\n5. To do this, we can write y = (The number of boys) because we want to break down the number of girls into the number of boys.\n6. Thus, the number of girls is equal to the sum of the number  of boys.\n7. This results in: x = y + the number boys. \n8. Therefore, we can simplify this to: x = y + z. \n9. In general, if the first number refers to the number of a specific group the second number refers to, the second number will be called x and the third number will represent the number of boys. \n10. Now, you can use any number x as long as the second number is always the number of boys. x = (the number of boys) z = (number of girls)\n11. By applying the Distributivity principle, we can write xz = x (number of boys) z(number girls) \n12. Substituting the numbers, we get xz = x(28) z(60) \n13.

The first equation is: 10(A+B+C)=10 where A, B, and C represent the number of eggs Tank gathered in the first and the second round and 10 are the total number of eggs Tank obtained.\n3. The second equation consists of: (A-B-C) / 6 = 60 where A, B. and C represent the number  of eggs Tank gathered and 60 are the total number  of eggs got.\n4. The third equation is: A + (B-C)- (B+C) = 6x where A, B, C are the total number of the eggs Tank gathered and x is the number of eggs other people collected.\n5.

The data in the chart gives us the amount of each type of computer sold, but does not tell us the total amount. \n6.

This means that each *small* tub costs $2.\n\n### Input:#include <iostream>\n\nint main()\n {\n  int a = 3;\n  int b = a + 1;\n  int c = 7 - b; // b = 4\n  return 0;\n }\n\n### Demostration: What would you get by replacing the line b = a + 5 with a = b + 1?\n\nInput: What would you get if you replace the line b = a+5 with a=b+1?\n\nOutput: You would get 5\n\nRationales:\n\nAnswer: You would get nothing as \"a=b+1\" doesn't make any sense. We will replace with a=b+5 if we do that then the value of b would change after addition of an variable 'a'\n\nComment: The line is clearly `int a = 3; int b = a + five;` so 5 is the value of b when you replace it.  Otherwise, the program cannot compile.  I suspect what you meant to write is \"You would get\" 5\"\n\nComment: I agree, you cannot replace it with a=b+five because five is not an integer. You can only replace it with a=5+5", "answer": " 5"}

It means that the sum of our whole age is my brother's age plus nine years.\nSo, it means that he's 9 years old. Therefore, I'm 21 years old.\n\n### Rationale:\n1.The problem starts with some information stating that the sum of our ages (that is I and my brother) will be 45 years in ten years.\n2. We're tasked to answer questions based on the available information and we have just a single question asked about my age.\n3. The problem assumes that I and my brother would both be 45 years on ten years later, that is, 2021.\n4. This information is sufficient for finding out my age in 2021 by subtracting the difference between 2021 and 2020 from 45.\n5. That is that my brother will be 35 years old if 2021 is subtracted from 45 and my case will be that I will be 10 years plus the difference which is 11 years. \n6. 11 years is subtracted from 2021 to find out my age and that is I will be 21 years.\n\n### Input : A plane was leaving for Sydney.

{"text": "In this scenario, we are going to identify the number of lettuce of which Village Fords need in order to make $1,000 in monthly sales.  The total number of tomatoes is not indicated in the problem, but we assume that it is sufficient enough to meet demand.  The monthly sales are equivalent to the number of customers multiplied by the price of each product.  The problem does not give the number of customers, but we can determine the product that we buy each month and the price of each product to be able to calculate the monthly sales. \n\nSince Village Foods sells vegetables with a set price on 1 head of lettuce and 4 tomatoes, we can determine the number of vegetables that need to purchase each month to make $1,200 in revenue. \n\nFrom the problem, we can determine that when villagers purchase 2 heads of lettuces for $1 each and, 4 for half-dollar for a total of $1000. \n\nTo calculate the number of lettuce that we need to buy each month to generate $1,209,500 in monthly revenue, we can use this formula: \n\n$1,200 <sup>1+100 -129- 0.5</sup> \n\n$1200 $121 $119.5 $119 $118.5 $8125.5 $1627.18 $5593.26 $559326 4\n\nBy solving for the value 8 heads of lettuce, we can conclude that each month, we need to purchase eight heads of lettuce to make $1,195 in monthly revenue.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n\n\nIn the math problem, we needed to determine how much revenue Village Foods would be able to make by selling lettuce and tomatoes.

{"text": "I understand from the problem that the poodle Luna is supposed to eat 1 cup of kabble daily. Mary provides Luna with 2 cups of the daily requirement instead. However, Frank also feeds her but instead of following Mary's habit, he feeds her twice the amount she should eat. And this, therefore, means that he feeds her once the actual quantity and once again more. To come up with the number of cups of remaining, I need to find the total after Frank's feeding.\n\nThe number of cups of kibbles after Mary's feeing is 11 cups since she feeds Luna with 2 at 2 time points of the day: once in the morning and once more in the evening.\n\nAgain, because of the fact that Mary provides 2 cups at 2 points in the day, the feeding at Frank's end happens to be 2 cups. Therefore, the remaining cups of the day are actually 11 - 2, and that is how many cups of the kibble are left. The cups left are thus 9. \n\nNow, let's say Frank had given Luna 1 cup in the afternoon and the same amount thrice, the actual amount is 4, leaving 1.\n\nAfter Mary's feeding, we have 2 + 1, or 3 cups of the kabble remaining and Frank's feeding leaves 1. In total, we have 4 cups since Mary gives 2 and Frank gives 2.\n\nSince we feed Luna 1 cup at Mary's end, and 2 cups at Frank's end, in total 3 cups of feeding are taking place with Mary, which means 3 + 2 = 5 cups is left.", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "Answer the following questions.\n1. What is the perimeter of a rectangle?\n2. A rectangle's perimeter equals four times the length multiplied by four times the base.\n3. So, the length can be found by dividing the perimeter by the base.\n4. Then, multiply the length by the width.\n5. The area is the multiplicative product.\nRationale: The above steps are all reasonable mathematical processes one may use to solve this scenario. The area of the rectangle can be found easily by solving for length. But there are multiple ways to solve the problem. So the reasoning and thought process behind the solution is what should be highlighted.\n### Input:\nThere's a cylinder that is one inch in diameter with a length of 12 cm. If its volume is 2,100 cc, what is the value of pi?\n\n### Rationales:\n* Solution: 3.14\n* The following steps are all reasonable and correct math. The volume of a cylinder can be found by the formula V=pi*(r^2*h), where V is the volume, pi is the value of pi, h is the height, and r is the radius of the cylinder. The radius of a cylinder can also be found by the formula r=d/(2*h), where d is the diameter of the cylinder. Using these formulas, the height and radius can be found. Then, multiplying by pi provides the volume with the value of 2100. The volume can also be simplified, and divided by the density of water (1g/cc, which can be converted to cm^3/cc). Using 1 liter = 1,000 cm^3, this gives 0.21 liters, which can be converted back to cm^3 to find the volume of the cylinder to be 0.21 x 2100 = 4220, which can be further simplified to 4200 cc.\n* This problem asks to find out pi from a cylinder's volume. So, let's find our volume first!\n* The volume of the cylinder can be calculated using the formula V=pi*r^2*h, replacing any known value while finding the constant pi. Note that the volume is expressed in cubic centimetres. In", "answer": " 44"}

I want to do it with some special effects.  But the thing is, I only have my smartphone and a webcam.  The software I have also demands that I create an outline for the video before I begin.  So, which of these two outlines can you create?\n\n1. The video is ten minutes.  There are 30 minutes in 4 hours (ten hours minus ten minutes) divided by two (15 minutes).  I can use this formula to figure out how many minutes there are in 24 hours.  I can make each one fifteen minutes and create a loop.\n\n2. The video is sixteen minutes in length.  There are thirty two minutes in four days (24 hours for each day minus 16 minutes for each day).  I can use \"16\" divided by \"32\" using a calculator.  This will give me an answer of \"0.5\" which means that it can be played over and over.\n### Rationale: \nThere are two different answers possible.  One would involve dividing \"10\" by \"4\" and then subtracting 10 from that answer.  In other words, the answer would be \"2.5\".  Another answer would be \"0.5\".

{"text": "Answer:\n\n### Demostration:\n1. To determine how many dogs the dog walker was contending with, we have to count the number of legs tangled up.  If we consider the 36 legs as being in groups of three, we can see that they are 12 groups in-total.\n2. It also states that there are 36 legs.  Taking this into consideration, we have 36 legs to divide between the given 12 groups, meaning that the average number of legs per group is 3.\n3. However, we can also understand that the dog walker would be responsible for all 36 legs, but some of the dogs would need to be detangled from leashes that aren't tied to them.  This makes us think that the dog walker has 30 extra legs to deal with.\n4. Using the average per group, we can divide 36 over 12 to obtain 3 as the outcome.  However, we have to then multiply by the additional number of legs to get the overall number of additional legs to be 30.\n5. We find the overall number of additional leashes to deal with by using the formula: 3x12=36\n6. Therefore:\n`36 - 30 = 6`\n7. This would imply that the dog walker was walking 6 additional dogs.\n8. Substituting the number 6 for the variable x in the solution (36-6=20) we get 20.\n9. The dog waler has 36 legs, 20 of which belong to the dog walker.\n10. She has to deal with 12 other dogs that need untangling, meaning that she is responsible for 20 legs in all.\nAnswer: 20.\n\n### Input for the task:\n\n### Response for the task:\n`x = 6`\n`x=4+2+x+x+x+1=20`", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "Input:The side of the square paper, say A, is 20 cm, and thus the height of the square paper is A+A. (The side is the height as well.)\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The problem states that the perimeter of a square is 20 cm less than half the height of a computer monitor, and it asks how much the height of the monitor is if the side of the paper is 20.\n2. This implies we need to find out what the side of a square is, if the height of the monitor (not the monitor itself) is 20 cm.\n3. We know that the height of the monitor should be at least 20, since this is the height of the square.\n4. Thus we can conclude that the side of the square must be at least 2 cm, (20-20). \n5. Because:\n      A = sqrt(2)\n      \u21d2A+A = (20+20)/2 = 20, thus\n      \u21d2A = 20, or\n      \u21d2 2/sqrt(2)cm = 20.\n\n### Output:The side of the sqare is 4cm\n\n### Output Verification:\n\n### Conclusion:", "answer": " 100"}

To solve the sum using algebraic means, you need to first isolate the variable which, in this case, is the letter x.\n\n2. Then, you need to equate the expression with 77 (i.e., x + x + x = 77).\n\n3. Here, we have 10x = 77, 10x = (7 \\* 7), and x = 7 \\* 2. 7 \\* 7 = 7 \\* (7 + 1), and 10x = x + 1x = x + (7 \\* 1).\n\n4. Finally, 10x + x = 10x, which makes 2x be the expression that makes it is equivalent to 77.\n\nHence, it would be expressed numerically as 99. \nA + B = 99, C + 96 = 195, D + E = 273, F + G = 369, H + I and J + K = 465.\nAnswer: B", "answer": " 1050"}

{"text": "Ittymangvark will get 33 1/3 fish per day.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. We can see that the fish are split equally between the 3 people but 44% of the remaining eyes are given away to their animal.  \n\n### Analysis\n\nThe input provides us with a situation where a family lives in the  most northern region of Alaska and everyone catches or shares the fish between each other equally. At the same time, they all eat and the dog gets fish in the ratio of 2/4 and Oomyapeck gets 1 and he is supposed to eat 22 eyes in one day. We can see that from the equation that 194 fish should be consumed overall so 97 fish is consumed among 3 people. Therefore, each person is given 33 113 fish to consume in one day for 3333 3333 fish is consumed on a daily basis. The answer is 33 1 13 for Oomyapeck, Ittymangnard, and Kingnook. And the reason is that 40% of the 194 fish he'd given him is 77 fish  And 194-77 equals 117.33 and 97 over three people equals 32.333\n\n### Test:\n1. A: C\n2. A: E\n3. A: B\n4. A: B\n5. A: B\n6.

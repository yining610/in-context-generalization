Did it mean that 3 from every 5 downloaded files were deleted? The latter one sounded more logical to me, but I was not sure. I looked for the definition of the \"3/5\". The definition of \"one-fifth\" is : one-fifth = 1/5 or one in five of something = 1/5. 400/200 = 2, meaning that for every 2 files downloaded in the second round, 1 of them were not needed.

Each day, the jellyfish population doubles, so: - 5000 = 5*2^0 + 5*2^1 + 5*2^(day+1), where 2^(day+1) is how many jellies are there on the second day + how many are there on the third day + how many are on the forth day + all, which is equal to 2 * 50 = 2.5 + 5 + 5 + number of jellies(day-2), which is equal to 10, so 10 plus number of jellyfish(day-3) which is equal to 50.

Some works, for example, give little indication as to what is right and what is wrong, leaving these moral questions to be determined by the reader.  Other works, however, are quite clear in their moral prescriptives.  Either way, each piece of literature must be interpreted through the understanding of its worldview.\nInput: \n\n### Instructions: \nA worldview is a perspective that a work offers about the way that reality works.  Often, these worldviews are the work\u2019s moral prescriptions; whether or not a work holds any overtly expressed morals, it is always shaped by what the work\u2019s creator values or dislikes.  In this way, the content and style of a work will often reflect its worldview.  Some works, however, can be difficult to pinpoint their worldview; in this case, each major character or motif may represent the work\u2019s prescriptive voice (or the work may actually have several voices).  However, the content and style may still reveal something of the worldview.\n\n### A worldview can be revealed by various elements of a work, including:\n\n  * Characters\n\n  * The relationships between characters\n\n  * The plot\n\n  * Motifs\n\n  * Metaphors\n\n  * Word choices\n\n  * Imagery", "answer": " 72"}

Let's start with the first as a warm up. You will notice that the first question is asked of a student and the second question is asked of a person who runs a bar.\n\nThe first question is a math question. The instructor is asking what someone else missed in an investigation of a corpse. To answer you need to consider all possible options, but you need to eliminate one of them in order to know exactly what they missed.\n\nTo determine what the person missed, you could look at everything they did and see if something is missing from one of the steps. In the example question, examining the body will tell you immediately what was missed. The examination of the body is perfunctory, meaning that something is done but done in a half-hearted manner. If it was done in a complete manner, it wouldn't have been missed. You might also take the word thorough, what does it mean to be thorough in your thinking?\n\nThis brings us to our second question. Here you look at a description of someone using their creativity and the options, you can't use an option if you can't eliminate it. You don't want to describe something in terms of other things you see, you want to describe it in terms of its own unique characteristics. To be thorough, you first have to consider what that person was thorough to, or in other words, thoroughly look for all possibilities of describing what they do. The question then tells you if you are correct.\n\nOur third question looks at the same concept, but applies it to a person describing something where quality is lacking. The person is careful in their descriptions by using all the options, but if you eliminate options this way, you end up having to look for ways to describe their description", "answer": " 66"}

{"text": "Winwin was able to take home 135.00 in this case.\n### Justification:\nThe tax for a lottery is 20% of the total earnings. The lottery earning was 50.00. The tax is a percentage of the sum. In this case, the sum is not the sum of the tax and the processing fee, it is just the lottery earnings. So, the answer would be: 50 x 0.2 = 10.00 and is tax. The tax is 10.0420. 50 - 10 = 40.00 (the total earnings minus the tax). The processing fee is an additional fee for the services provided. The processing fee is $5 (the only input). So, 40.04 - 5 = 35.04 (the total earnings - the processing fee). The total earnings - the tax = $35.04. The total that Winwin was able to keep = $35. $50 x 02 = 135.\n### Explanation\nTax is a percentage of anything, so the tax is always a sum of the base amount times the tax %. In this case, the tax percent is 20% So, 0.2 x whatever is the answer.\n\nThe processing fee could be any amount if we do not know the percentage, but in this case, the processing fee was $5 (the only number entered).

The **Algorithm,** in turn, takes in the samples, performs an action on all of them, and then returns new samples in the form of data to be processed. So, **Algorithms** are processes that transform data. **Programming** is the way in which we tell the **Algorithm** to take our samples and perform actions on them. \n\n### Example in action: \nConsider the following example of a simple **Algorithm** to shuffle a deck of cards.  When called by the **Programmer,** the **Algorithm** performs the following actions:\n\n#### Algorithm\n1. Start with the deck ordered from Ace of Spades on the bottom to Jack on the top.\n2. Take each card from the end of the deck. (32 cards)\n3. Swap the order of the 2 cards. (16 cards)\n4. Put the cards back into their original order. (32 cards).\n5. Do steps 2-4 for the second half of the deck.\n\nThis example describes an **Algorithm** but not a **Program** or **Proceduration.** Each algorithm is a recipe that tells us how we might perform some action repeatedly. So, in the case of shuffling a deck of cards, we have written down a procedured action to be performed on all of the cards within a deck of cards.\n\n### Discussion:\nThink about other ways to shuffle a deck.

So three quarters of the total number of votes would be for the unicorn. The number of unicorn votes is half of total votes.  And 25 is 1 quarter of 100 thus another quarter comes from another source.  One quarter from the witch and the other quarter from the dragon.

The formula for finding the amount of water remaining in the container after T minutes is A + B + F + W, where B = gain of water, F = loss of water, = Amount of water left in container, \" +\" indicates the time the cap was open, \" *\" indicates the time the tap was open.\n\n```\nL = (a + b + f + w)\n```\n\nThus\n\n```\nL * T = A + B + F\n```\n\nTherefore\n\n```\nL1 - A1 * T1 = B1 + F1\n```\n\nThis formula means that the total amount of water gained from the tap in minutes is 2330003.9999993 seconds \u2248 0.583672117 hours.\n\nThe following shows how to obtain the value for each variable.\n\n```\nT =?\n```\n\nAfter each calculation, the last part is the number of seconds, so the last part is not converted to minutes.\n\n```\nA =?\n```\nIt should be mentioned that Robi Ney can empty the water through the cap and so on.\n\n```\nB =?\n```\nTherefore\n```\n12 L * T = 12 A + 12 B + F\n```After each calculation, the solution is divided by 12 and an integer value\n\n```\n12 B = 736825.040003845 seconds\n```\n\nThere is loss.

How effective was your response? What did you do as your teacher?\n\n-  This is a difficult question because it does not give a question, which requires that I find the problem myself, and then figure out what to do.  My answer is an over simplification of a simple problem.  By not showing my work, you cannot see if I've made any errors.  This can be a dangerous assumption to make when solving these sorts of problems, as many simple problems have a large number of ways they can be solved by more than one method.  This is a difficult concept to learn, but necessary in problem solving.\n\n-  My response, as asked, is fine as a method for solving many real life scenarios.  It has the potential to be more difficult than it is by removing the context in which the data was given.  My method also gives a specific solution to each scenario.  In practice, though, you may find that a scenario will only contain one or two pieces of data.  With data this sparse, any solution method will be overkill.

Then, that number has to be placed in a multiplication formula for the boys as the numerator. The total number of boys in the family is 5(7/5). Multiply that by $3,900 and we get $32,275. Divide the value by the total number of children in total, and place the answer at (70), (32,278/180). The answer is $32,288.44 divided by $39,000 = $4,753.92 for each boy.\n\n### Output:\n\n```\nWe do the multiplication first and place the value of the division: 5 boys divided by 7 girls and placed in a ratio of 5:7.

Doubling it gives a 8 times bigger distance.\n\nDistance is 900\n\nDouble the distance gives distance : 900*2 -> 1800\n\nDrive time should be 12 hours, now multiplying that by 8 gives us the original drive time of 96 hours.", "answer": " 4"}

I will also go ahead and assume there are 300lbs available for the last passengers as 300/50 = 6, not including their luggage.\n\n### Solution:\n1. The first passenger has 150lbs of luggage, he can still take his 5 bags of maximum weight. 250-150 = 100, so the 1 remaining person on the trip will have 100lbs.\n2. The second passenger only has 450lbs of total luggage left even with 5 max bags.  If the person had 5 bags of max luggage then he would only have 250lbs.  100lbs needed for another person + 250l- 5 bags = 205l.  205l = 250l+100l.  450l - 5(50/lb) = 300l. 250/50 =3/5ths, 2^2-1= 2.  300/2= 150l and 150l is 5 more than the first passenger.  \n3. The third passenger cannot take another bag as their current luggage weighs over 4m, while 450-4*5 =365 is the max.  6000-450 - 365 = 2085l. I chose the number of remaining people to be 300l (6.05x50) because it is a nice round number.  300bx5 is 1500l and there is no way to evenly split the remaining 2085 among the remaining 5 passengers. \n4.  The fourth passenger has all of their luggage left as 400-5*50 = 380 is the max for their luggage. 9000-400=8600l. 8600/8 =1000l.  I don't know if anyone", "answer": " 90"}

Also, 4 out of 5 of those 16 people play football. 4 of 7 = 2 out of 7, which becomes 0.28571428571. 28.571429% of the people like football. For each person that likes football, 50% of them play football. So you have 0.5 ( 24/60) and 4 ( 16/16). 50% of 0.5n is 0.5(0.28591428591)= 0.14295717294 = total people in a group that like football.\n\n50% of 14.295714% is 7.1480678004% of your group that plays football. 0.71480680407 = 7.15 people that play football. 7.15 out of 255.71 people that like football is equal to 0.2792702159 = 28 people.

However, I would assume that you would go on to say that if I do get the seven, then why, if on a six-sided dice I have a 50% chance of getting a 7 then I know that the odds would work out at one point, if I roll this number of dice. \n\n**Item", "answer": " 32"}

Now that they cost her only $400, she'd been spending $1,200 of that $2,00 before. She's a lot better off now with $600 less monthly expenses. So she's making $1,700 in total.\n\n### Input\nMs. Snyder used up half of the candy bar. She was hungry and ate three more. Then she was satisfied\n\n### Response\nHer first stab at solving the equation is not to eat the bar at all. By dividing both sides of the equation by 2 and subtracting 2 from both sides, you get 3 = x. This is a solution. A half eaten bar will leave her with 3 pieces, leaving her with 3/2 of a bar. That's what happened in the first example.\n\n### Now let's say she eats one piece of candy and divides. This time, 16 = 2x. This is not a solution, because if eating one piece made her hungry, she wouldn't eat another.\n### Finally, 9 = 2x, which is a solution. We can put this on the left (multiplying out and dividing by 2): 2 = 2x. If we can solve for x, we can solve for y, which is half of the number of pieces she wants.\n### 2 divided by 2 leaves a remainder 1. It can't divide into two evenly, and all that we did was to multiply by 2, so it must have left a remainder 1. Therefore, 2x = 4. If we divide both sides by 2, our equation becomes 1 = 2x.\n### Now, solve for x. It's the same procedure as before, except we're looking for x: it's now equal to 1/2 of 2, or 1/2 x 2, which is the same as 1/2.\n### 1/2,", "answer": " 1000"}

If the horse eats five bites for every seven seconds, how many seconds does it take for the horse is eat one bite of grass?\n\n### Demostration:\nHow many seconds does it take?\nWell, the horse eats five for every seven.\nSo when it eats five it takes seven seconds to eat.\nSo when it takes 80 biting, it takes seven seconds.\n\nLet's go like this: \nIt's five bites over 7 seconds.\n\nIt eats 40.\nIt takes 4 seconds.\n\nThe first 4 bites took *4 seconds*. \nThen it took two seconds in between.\n\nNow it's 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds.

Eight seconds.\n\nThen, we say 8.\n\n8 seconds, plus eight again. Eight seconds over again plus eight seconds\nequals 16 seconds.

This application supports the whole software-development lifecycle within the company and is used to communicate, store, and maintain files.\n\n### What has to happen for us to complete this challenge?\n**What? The whole team needs to complete it.**\n- We will have a group meeting to discuss the challenge.

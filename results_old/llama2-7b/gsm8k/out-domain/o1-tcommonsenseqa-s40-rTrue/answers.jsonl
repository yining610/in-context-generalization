{"text": "825\n\n### Explain:\nFrom the instructions: \"He planted plants of three colors...\". 10 of them are yellow. So, we have 10 yellow flowers.\nThere are more purple flowers than yellow flowers. So purple flowers count 18 times more than yellow flowers.\nHence, there are 180 purple flowers.\nThe number of yellow plus the number of purple must equal the number of total flowers.  (There are other colors, but they do not matter.)\nThus, yellow plus purple = total flowers.\n10 + 180 = total flowers.\ntotal flowers/total flowers=10+10/10=20.\nNumber of yellow flowers = 10 divided by 20 = 1/2\nNumber of purple flowers = 180 divided by 2 = 90\n\nThus, Mark has 1/2 + 90 = 91 flowers total.

Now all we need is to figure out how to solve for the total number of trail-mix pouches. We do this by determining the maximum number of pouches (per person) and then multiplaing that number by the total number of individuals. To maximize the number of pouches per individual, let's find the largest number of individuals in our given group. We can do this by listing them out in order from greatest to least (highest to lowest) and dividing by two (because there are an even amount of individuals and \"divide by two\" gets us an integer answer when division would otherwise result in a fraction): \n * #1: 16 total individuals + 6 helpers = 22\n * #2: 15 total individuals + 7 helpers = 27\n * #3: 14 total individuals + 7 8 helpers = 24\n * #4: 13 total individuals + 6 6 helpers =??\nNow we can get our answer by subtracting from 24 and dividing by two:\n * 27 - 24 = 3 (answer)\n * 24 - 20 = 4 (answer)\n * **20 - 18** (answer)\nTo recap: we determined that each individual in a group of 18 would be able to eat 3 bite-sized individual pouches, which was our original target number of pouches for each person.\n\nAnswer: 3", "answer": " 3"}

This means that she shelved 4 poetry books and 4 romance books. This leaves 10 from poetry.\n\n3. So if from the bottom section of the bookshelf, Nancy shelved 5 western novels and 6 Biographies, she shelved 5+6 = 11 western novels and 5 romance books which she placed on the top. This means that 8 history, 9 poetry, 5 western and 6 mystery books are left.\n\n4. Nancy shelved remaining books from the bookshelf, including 5 western novels, and 6 biography and 3 romance books.

But he's only allowed to give away a total of $70 (in increments of at least $10) and each employee needs to get the exact same amount. So, what amount, rounded to the nearest dollar, can he give each employee?\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe first 30 seconds of the question are not sufficient to come up with an answer. We need context in order to know how much each employee earned.

(You must explain the basic principle of the movement of the sun, moon, and planets.)\n\n### Response :The sun, moon, and other planets are always seen in the east or west because the Earth is stationary and the rest of the planets revolve around it.\n\n### Response 2:\n\nThe sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west after being in the sky for 12 hours. However, a person is standing on Earth so they experience 24 hours in a day. This is because the Earth makes a 360 degree revolution, completing a full circle in 24 hours, while the Sun moves only 180 degrees. The Moon, Earth, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Venus revolve around the center of the Solar System (the Sun), in which Earth is only one of the eight planets and it takes exactly 365 days and approximately 5 hours, to complete a revolution around the Sun. The Earth, however, rotates on its axis daily, which causes day and night to shift in the sky.  Therefore, the Sun and Moon appear to rise and set in the east and west because the Earth is not moving  but it is making its own revolution.\n\n### Demo A:\n\nThe stars in the sky have only been observed since a couple thousand years ago. This is because of the rotation of the Earth. While the Earth revolves around the Sun, Earth is also revolving around itself, causing a change in the location and appearance of the Sun, Moon, and stars at night.\n\n### Reponse:\n\nAstronomers are not the only ones to be dazed by the speed of our galactic dance.

{"text": "F: more than ten\n\n### Rationale:\n1. \"twice the amount\" is a mathematical way to say \"double\".  This sentence says, \"Caleb's dad's catch was twice as great as Caleb's.\" \n2. The question, then, asks \"How many more\", and so we are looking for how many times bigger the numbers from the end of the sentence are than the ones from the beginning of the sentence.\n3. Because we are told the dad's catch is \"twice as great\" as our own, we can assume that his catch is also twice as big as Caleb'e.  However we can then compare our dad's catch with Caleb's catch and find that the catch our dad catches is more than twice as big as Cales himself.  Hence, the answer to the question is F: more than twice.\n\n\n### Input:\"I just spent $20 on food to sustain me during my bike ride in the park.\"\n\n\n### Response F: food\n\n### Rationales:\n1. \"The word 'to sustain' means to help someone (or something) to live.  'Sustain' sounds like'survive.' It is also used in economics to mean'support' or'maintain.'  'Sustain me' sounds like a plea.\n2. I spent $20 on '...to sustain...' means to spend money in order to help you to live longer or to stay alive. But 'food' is the kind of item that'sustain' me can refer to.\n3. It is obvious that 'food' means the kind of food to'sustain life.'\n\n\n### Instructions:Read the prompt and construct an appropriate response.\n\n### Input:- In the summer of 2019, after finishing the 2019 European Championship, Dempsey's team defeated South Korea.

{"text": "In order to solve this problem, first gather and organize all of the given information. From this, we can calculate that: 1. Thor is 4 times older than Ironman, since Thor has been around for 1456 and Ironman is 4 times younger because Ironman is 33 years old. 2. Thor is 3 times older than Ironman and Captain America, since we can say that Thor has been around for three times 1456. We can see that Thor is 4X3X3X3 (1+1+1+1) times older than Ironman but only by 23 years. But we see that Thor is 13 times old than Captain America, which suggests that there might be something missing and we should find that and add it up to 13. Then we notice that Thor is 4 times old than Captain America and Iron Man combined. That means that Thor is 4+4=8 times older than Captain America and 8 times = 8\u00d723=184 years old.\n\nRationales:\n1. Thor is 15 times older than Captain America 1456-13 times older than old Peter Park which is 23 because 13 time older = 3 times (1) 2. We notice that Ironman is 8 times older than Captain and that Thor is 4x3 so that means Thor is 8-4=4 times older, implying that thor is 4 times older.\n3. In this step we make a diagram showing the information we have and use it to subtract the ages. From this, we see that Thor is in fact 8 times older than Cap and 4 times older than ironic but are still need to find out how Captain and Ironman are combined.\n4. In this step, we find out that Thor is 8 times older and 4 times older which is a total of 12 times older.\n5. We find out that Thor is then 4x3=12 times older than Captain America but not by 12 because we add 13 to 12 to 2 times which is 25, so that means Thor is then 12\u00d723=279 years old.", "answer": " 48"}

To put 60 in mathematical terms, we have the 60 is multiplied by 2.\nIn that way, 60 eggs in one round plus 60 eggs in another round plus 60 (1+2) = 140 eggs.\nHence, 60 + (140 * 2) = 180 eggs.

{"text": "The question states that Carl types at 50 words per minutes. Now, lets think about the words per minute. For example, 1 hour x 60 mins = 600 seconds. So, 1 hour x seconds = total words. We can use this type of math to answer the questions given, but we need to know the unit of measurement, which in mathematics, is used for seconds. To find out the total number of words typed in a day is 600 seconds x 50 words = 30,000 words. Now, we just need to convert this number into words per day. (600 seconds x second x 50 words) / (60 seconds x second) = 30, 000 words. Thus, with this equation, we can calculate word per day. 4 hours x 24 hours = 96 hours per week. Then 96 hours week x 1440 minutes per day. Then 1440 minuite per day. So, 1440min/ 1 min = 1440 hrs / min/ min => 1440. 1440 days in 7 days.

To determine what that amount is, we need to know what we have at the start, which means using the first step that we have available to us.  This means that we need to subtract the first condition (\"five pencils and [two] erasers\" from the second (\"Apple and pencil and eraser.)

{"text": "Sally picked 16 pounds, Jenny picked 10 pounds, and Moses picked 3 pounds. \n\n### Demosration:\nInput: Sally, Jenny, and Moses each get $50 back at the end of the day. How are their paychecks calculated?\n\nOutput: (A) Sally: $43; Jenny: $32.50; Moses: $25\n\n\nChoices: A: Sally: $42.50; Jenny: $27.50; Moshe: $20\nB: Jenny: $46.25; Moses: $44\nC:Sally: $32, Moses: $20\nD: Jenny: $50; Moses : $25\n\nRationales: In a similar fashion to the last one (which involved a \"how much\" question), we must determine the weight of the strawberry harvest. To do this, we need the pay of each person picking strawberries and then subtract the entrance fee, which is $128 in total. By multiplying this number by 3, we see that there was a total of 40 pounds of strawberries harvested.\nHowever, in answering the question of \"total pay\", we must remember that Sally, Jenny &amp; Moses will also receive their $50 from entry fee.\n\nBy multiplying the 40 lb strawberry harvest by the average cost per pound ($20) of strawberry, we see that the total amount paid is $800.\n\nAfter subtracting the entrance fee, we will receive a total of $700. So if we take $800 and subtract $128, the 40 pounds of harvested strawberries, we will have $672.\n\nNext, we need to divide that amount by the number of strawberries, 40. Which leads to $16.75. Then, to get the three individual payouts, we need to round off $16.76 to: $17.\n\nThe payouts of the three would work out for each of the three to be $43 for Sally, $25 for Mos", "answer": " 7"}

Given: We assume that Lao is selling 127 or at least 127 chicken and he made $65 profit from the sale\n3. If Lao made $65 profit and he is selling 1 or at least 1 chicken for 1.50 then the profit gained from one chicken is say 0.50\n4. Since there are 127 chicks we can say that the profit Lao made from one chicken is then 50 x 127 is 127.50 which is close to 127 so this is then the profit from one chicken and if Lao made $64 then this means he made a loss of $66 and this cannot be true\n5.

Therefore, if there are 81 cents in the pen, how much is missing in the wilderness.\n\nDemonstration:First, multiply 81 by 10 to find how many times 81 and 10 are. 81 x 10 is 810, since 81 times 10 is 10 times 81, meaning 10 times 10 is also 810. However, since 810 only contains 81, we say it's rounded to the nearest tuberous percent and therefore the closest tuberous to 810 is 11, which we round down to 810 and then divide 15 by 81 to get 20.\n\nThus at the end of the sentence \"therefore, if there are 51 in the pen, how do you get from the wilderness?\" That means that if 20010 are 81 times as many, 20 times as many would be equal to 81000010, since 20 x 81 is 1620.

We can assume that the project is not done because Beco asked for the project to be \"too much of work.\" Alternatively, the workload given was excessive, or Beco's \"company\" has given \"too much of task\" in other months.\n4. However, if the project is not done by September 4th, the employee should not be eligible for an incentive as \"he did not finish the assignment give by... on time\" suggests he should have finished it on the given date. Hence, the employee should not have been paid on September 4. Hence, the answer should be B: Beco Did Not Give The Employee A Project To Work, Which Was Difficult. In this case, he was too busy working on the project instead of", "answer": " 25"}

{"text": "### A. 30 B. 16 C. 24 D. 32\n\n### Answer:  D-32, since everyone in the class makes 8 cards, if they get to 1000, they'll still need an additional 24.\n\n### Justification: We can figure this out by starting with the given fact that in the class of 30, if everyone makes 8 cards, then the total number of cards that were made combined by everyone equal 8x30 = 240. Now looking at the second part of the question, it states that to get the pizza party, they'll need 1000 cards. Therefore, we need to take the difference between those two values. That way, we look for the number missing in the equation in order to get to a total of 1000. Since 1000-240=760, it's simply a question of whether the number of available cards is greater than 760. If not, then we need 32 more cards to make it to 100.\n\n### Question 1: What is 3.5% of 330?\n\n### Answer to Question 1: 503, 3.5% is 330x0.035=17\n\n### Questions 2-4: Which of the two numbers (a or b) is greater? a. 495 b. 510\n\n### Question to the first subquestion: What is the difference between those two?\n\n### a) 15 b) 6 c) None of the above\n\n### 1) The difference between (495-510)=-5 is -5 d) (494-509)=5 and that's the difference between those two numbers. Now, that's 5. The same thing holds true for 15, we can say that 15 is equal to that difference. Since the first statement is true, the second must also be true.\n\n### 2) We can look at the question and see that we're asked to figure out which of the two numbers is greater.

{"text": "Rationales:Firstly, we see that the task is worded in the way of giving a riddle or a math problem. That indicates that this question also asks us to use our logical deduction skills because of how they phrased the riddle as a math problem.\nSecondly, as they stated, the girl Isabel has some money in her saving account. That tells us, she has some money not in her hand or pocket because saving accounts do not provide immediate access to cash. So to me, this leads us to the second question the question-asker wants to clarify: \"Does she have the same amount in her hand or pocket?\".\nNext, we're told by the questioner that Isabel spends half of the amount and buys a toy. Next, we're told that she spent half of the remaining amount and bought her brother a comic book. Next, if she has $51 remaining, we want to calculate how much she originally had in her bank account. Therefore, given this information, we can find the answer of how much Isabel was initially given.\nAfter we have a fair background of the riddle, we should notice that they have stated that when Isabel has half of whatever she has in her saving account, she buys a toy which implies that the amount in the bank account that she initially has to buy the toy is an even number and it has to be in the range of $10, $20, $30 because they said \"half of whatever she has in the bank.\" If the amount has to be an even number she can buy either a $20 toy or a $10 toy and half of it is $10. Then, if she has more than $20 left, she could buy another toy and half of those 2 toys would be $10. However, if the amount is $20, she can only buy the $20 toy because that is what she has left, so now the amount becomes an odd number. If this is the case, she can buy the toy, then use the rest to either save or spend on another toy or something that has the same value.\n\nNext, we can put all of those together, and here's what comes up: $20, $10, $5, $2. So the logical deduction for this task is that Isabel was given the amount of $", "answer": " 204"}

Since T = 40% + 60% = 100, you want to find what 40% is in 100, which is.40 and 60% of 100 is.60. So T = 100% +.40 +.60 = 140. You want to know how much is 40% of 140, which is.56.

{"text": "Tommy's total number of wheels would equal 72. In any given 4-wheeled vehicle in his neighborhood, there is a high probability of a car and a truck.  By knowing the number of vehicles in each type of vehicle, we can calculate how many total wheels there are by assuming that each type of vehicle is equivalent to 100% of the total vehicles.  We can find out what percentage of each type of vehicle in his neighborhood by analyzing how many of each type there are.   We can use this formula: total wheels equals (1st type of vehicle)/(total)*100%, wherein \"1st type of vehicle\" represents the number of vehicles of one type and \"total\" represents the total number of vehicles to determine the percentage.   By substituting the facts given in the question, the total wheels equals: 12/15=72/100.\n\n### Input(Same as above):Tommy goes for a walk around his neighborhood and deciding to calculate how many wheeled vehicles there are. All the truck in his neighborhood have 6 wheels, and all the cars have 4 wheels in his neighborhood. If he sees 60 trucks and 40 cars, how many wheeled vehicle did Tommy encounter?\n\n### Solution:\n\nTommy's number of wheels equals 72.

{"text": "Input: John only took a perfunctory look at the bookcase. He went through and put everything back, but he looked at only the covers of the books, so he never learned if there were any books in the bookcase that were missing. \n\n### Solution: \nThe correct answer will be any word that means thorough. \n\nExamples: \n1.  A: Thorough (adjective) : careful in working out every detail. \n2.  B: Thoughtful (adjective) : giving careful and sympathetic attention. Careful in thinking. \n3.  C: Complete (adjective) : fully finished or finished completely. A total; absolute. 4.  D: Thoughtful (noun) : attention paid. \n5.  E: Thoughtful (adj, noun) : mental, intellectual activity : thought : cogitation. \n\n##  Answer: F: complete. To solve for any complete, we need to understand that what John is doing is he's examining the bodies, and he's completing what is required. However, to determine if he's missed something or not, we need to say \"if\" he had been more what. To determine what that is, we need to understand the situation of the people of that town. So we have to answer if John was more what with regards to body, he wouldn't have missed the cause. Then we can use a word that means body. Body can mean the physical body you carry or it can mean something more abstract and it can be in reference to the body of the work which we could also say body of thought. We have to understand that this is in reference to something abstract and a synonym for complete is absolute so the answer must be absolute the adjective form of complete. A synonym for complete is also finalize and thorough. There are 2 adverbs, careful and complete, to describe things. But they don't describe a thorough examination. If John was more what, he wouldn't be careful or complete. A thorough means that he would make a thorough examination. So we need to go from \"complete\" that's what we're looking for. We can't go further than what we are now without the word \"more\" to be used. \n\n## HW: \nIn your opinion, which answer option", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "If we assume the temperature (or average temperature) is 28 degrees celsius, The evaporation rate of water is 0.47mm/h, The rate of evaporation of salt water will be faster, which will increase the amount of salt in the bucket after a day.\n1. If 2 liters of salt water evaporates, we need more than 2 liters of water to replace, so the amount of water in the bucket can't be less than 2 liters.\n2. Based on the given information, we know that the bucket contains 2 liters of salty water, and it will not contain more sea water, so the salt water will not replace.\n3.

How many more chocolate boxes should he buy if he wants to make it to 15 hours?\n\n### Demo:\nAnswer: In 12 hours, Aaron can consume 1 whole box of chocolates. Since he can eat 1 whole box of cocoa in 12 hours, it implies he can eat 1/12th of a box in each hour.\n\nSince he can eat at most 1/12 of a box, 1 box every 12 hours. For each additional box, he eats a chocolate box an hour earlier. \nTherefore, to eat a box of chocolate every 15 hours he needs 3 more (4) boxes, since he is consuming them in 12-hours intervals.\n\nHence, 4 more boxes of chocolates should be bought by Aaron to eat it within 15 hours.\n\n\n### Input - A 18-meter ladder reaches from the sidewalk to an apartment 7.2m above the ground.

Let's say I stood at the edge of my roof (or the end of my driveway) and looked in your bedroom window. Your bedroom window is how far above your 90 pounds body.\n5.

{"text": "10 days.\n\n### Rationales:\n1.The sentence \"Emery and Serena have to read the book\" indicates that at least one of the two will be reading a book for the purpose of this task or project.\n2. The sentence \"If (one of) them can read five times as (fast as) (the other), The book takes her 25 days to read\" indicates that the speedy reader reads five times faster than the slow (reader). It also indicates that they'll take (at most) 20 days to complete the project and read the book. However, since the slower one takes that much time to read (the book), the task of completing this project together and reading the book will take both readers a lot of extra time, as the faster one will need to patiently wait and go slower than their speed to accommodate for the slower reader. This can be logically seen when we factor in that \"The book takes her 2o days to read,\" as the slower reader takes longer to read the book than the faster reader does, even (the slower reader is reading) five times slower than the slower reader. This also suggests that the combined time of both readers reading the book is less than 20 days, as that time is shared by two readers.\n\n3. Since \"The fast reader reads 5x faster than the slow reader\" and \"It takes them at most 20 days to finish the book,\" if we take the average speed of the fast reader as 1/5 of the slow reader's speed, we can calculate that the fast reader's speed is (at most) 4 times as fast as the slow reader's. Thus, the faster reader's speed is greater than 4 times the slower reader's speed but less than 5 times the slower reader' reading speed. Thus, if the two readers read the book at their respective speeds, the two readers together will take (at most) (the faster reader's speed - the slower reader's reading speed) * (the faster reader' speed) / (the slower reader's speed) = 4 * (the faster reader speed / 5) - 1 = 4* 1/5 - 1 = 8 - 1/(5)= 3 (rounding to the nearest number) = 3 days.

Therefore, Lucille would need 7 cans (4+3) of paint (14m2 * 7 = 98m2, but each can contains 2 square meters, which equals 49m2. Therefore, Lucille needs 7 cans (14m2-49m2=98m2/2 = 49m2/2 \u2248 24.5m2, so 7 cans)\n2. Hence, the answer would be D: seven\n\n### Rationale:\nTo summarize the answer for the above question, we are looking for:\n1. A length and width.\n2. The walls are parallel.\n3. The given figure shows us Lucille is painting her room with walls\nEach wall needs to be covered by (the length multiplied by the width) of the number of cans of paint Lucille has.\nFor example, the first wall requires 4m2 of paint, the second wall requires 2x5m2 = 10m2 of paint, and the third wall requires 2x2m2 = 4m2 of paints.\nTherefore, total required = 4m2+  10m2+ 4m2 = 18m2 \n\nNoticed how we divide the total by the total number of cans (4 cans)\nDivide 18 m2 by 4 m2 = 4.5 m2 \u2248 4.5 \n\nFrom here, notice how there are no remainder (no 0.5, just 4.5 m 2)\nThis suggests the requirement for all 4 walls\nThis means that Lucille either has 5 cans (as in the first choice) or 7 cans (as in our answer).\n\nNoticed that all of the choices are between 3 and 7?\nThe only choice that satisfies the wall sizes (3 & 5m) and requirement is 7 cans (because 4 & 5 m = 9 \u2248 10", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": "Chandler has sold 3 + 4 + 3 rolls of wrapping paper which equals 10 rolls not the 12 rolls. Chandler only needs to sell 2 more rolls.

Chandler needs to sale 12 rolls but has only sold three. (He's sold 3).\n3.

Since he didn't walk with his father, he walked to school with some reluctance which proves that he walked 3 2/4 miles instead of 3 2/", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "The total number of buyers on the three days is 350.\n\nJustification: The given question is expressed in the structure *there were no more/fewer than* + *there were*, used to ask about the number of things of a particular kind in two comparison situations. Here, the first one is a greater than comparison and the second one is a less than comparison.  \n\nThe first comparison asks about the number of buyers present in the \ngrocer's store on the third day in comparison to the second day. This \ncan be said as \"there were {number of buyers} on the third day than the \nsecond day.\" Let's call this *greater than-less than* (g-l). Using the \nsame logic of g-l, we write the second comparison in the \nstructure {total number of buyers that visited the store over three days} = [buyers on last day - buyers on yesterday] + [buyers on third day]. \n\nLet's call this *g-l*. In summary, we get:\n\n3rd day number of buyers >  2nd day number of buyers < 3rd day number of\n   buyers. \n\nIn the question, the 30 more buyers on the  3rd day is the result of the  \ng-l and  350 is the result of the g-l. To get the answer for the g-l, find\n   the number of buyers in the 3rd day lesser than the number of buyers on\n   the 2nd day. Hence, answer is 150. Then, using this number as the \n   midpoint, find the midpoint from 1st day and calculate difference between\n   it and third day number of buyers.

The second drink contains 3 times as much caffiene and is only 2 ounes larger but the same amount of sugar.\n2. He then takes a cafiene pill the has as much cafiene as the two drinks combined (2x50g +2x250g).  So 80g of caffiene and 250g of sugar\n\n### Rationale:\n  The question starts off with the fact that John drinks 2 energydrinks. The two  energydrinks are different sizes and with different percents of caffiene and water.\n\n### \nWe can find the cafiene intake by finding the individual amounts of cafiene taken from each energy drink. \nThe first energy drink has 250g on cafiene (2oz x 125g) and a total of 250g and the second energy drink is 3 times as much water as the first and has 250 g caffiene and 50 g of sugar.\nNext we can find the sugar intake  since its the second energy drink that has 100 g of sugar.  However John also takes a cafiene pill with 80g of  cafiene.\nSince the cafiene pill has a total of 120g of cafiene as well, we can subtract 40 g of cafiene from the second energy drink as well as from the cafiene pill.\n\n### Summary:\nJohn drinks 2 Energy drinks, each weighing 12oz.

Firstly, when we subtract 3 from the number 4 * total number of students of elementary school, we will get lesser number. Then, when we add lesser number to total number of students of middle school, we will get the total number of students of both levels. \n\n### Instructions:In this lesson plan, students will use proportional reasoning to understand and analyze problems involving addition.  They will interpret proportional relationships as multiplicative comparisons of quantities. \n\n## Instructions:Create a program that asks the user to enter two numbers and display the sum of those numbers.  Then your program must ask for a second pair of inputs, and it must determine the sum of the second pair.  Your program's output must display the first sum after the first pair has been summed, followed by a blank line.  Then it must display the sum of the second input, followed by a blank space\n\n### Response 17:\nYour program must include two methods.  The first method should prompt the user for two integers.  Once the user has entered the two values, then your program should ask if the user wants to continue.  If the user does not want to continue, then display another message to prompt the user to continue.  Otherwise, call the other method.  The second method should sum the integers and display to the user the sum followed by a space.  Your program should then display another message to ask if the user wants a summary of this addition.\n\n### Input For This Problem:Enter the values in this field: 4 \n### Response 9:  Your second program should include two methods.  Then your program should display the sum to the user.  Finally, after the user has entered the last pair, then your program should display a blank space and the sum of the previous pair of integers.\n\n## Instruced:Write a program that will add two numbers.  When the user enters a first pair of values, store the first number as x.  Then, store the second number as y.  Your program should display x + y to the user.

He has no hesitation about what he is doing, and he may even feel a sense of pride in doing it.  If John were to have compunction about accepting the invitation, then he would not do it without guilt or remorse.  Since John does have compunction (a \"feeling of remorsep\" or \"guilty\") about accepting the invitation (if he has any), John does not accept the invitation.  \n1. What is the question asking?

I can only assume that John will not feel good about it.  Why?

{"text": "Input:Roberto and Vanessa can skip a total of 7,480 skips.\n\n### Rationale:\nAn hour is equal to 60 minutes. Valerie's skips are 1 minute long. Valerie can do 120 min (60 minutes) / (1 minute) = 120 skips, or 80 jumps per minute. This means Valerie can do 80 skips in 1 minute. Roberto's skips are equal to 5,000 minutes (500 x 10 = 5,00o). If you subtract Valerie's jumps per minute from Val's skips per minute, you get 1 minute minus 80 jumps which is 1 minute - 80 skips = 1 minute - (120 skips) and 1 minutes - 80 skipsi times 5,00 minutes = 1,000 minutes - 1 minutes = 0 minutes. 500 minutes is equal to 15 times 30 minutes. If you multiply Valeria's total jumps and Roberto's total skips by 30, you will get a total of 78,000  skips.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour. 10,000  minutes is equal to 3 hours and 20 minutes.

Let us have the remaining sick days as a variable C and then add it to B (the number of remaining vacation days), the result of which we will denote as D.  However, since 20 days of vacation is worth 160 hours, we can see that the result of which is 160-5 (the hours used from sick days) equals D-B, or 155 total remaining days.

{"text": "The perimeter of the triangle is 16 cm. There are many ways to calculate the third side length; one way is to find its midpoint and extend it to the point where it intersects with the two other sides.

This can be done by using Pythagoras' theorem. Next, we can find the midpoint of the two sides and extend it to where it intersects with both other sides.\n\n### Rationale\nThe perimeter of a three-angle triangle is a function of the length of either side, the length of the other side, and the area of the whole triangle, which is equal to pi times the perimeter. The perimeter is the total length of all sides taken together, while the area of a triangle is the area of its base times and half-length multiplied by 180 degrees.

The price of the two stuff animals combined is therefore four times as much as the price of the sticker.  That leaves the price of the stiffler unspecified, but let's assume it equals the price of the magnet.  This would mean that a stuffed animal costs $3*3 + $0.25 = $3.5; that is, a single stuffed animals costs $3.5 dollars.  If an individual stuffed animal costs $20.00, then the remaining $16.5 would be due to the magnet, meaning that the magnet costs $3.0 (3.5 x 0.6).  The price of a single stuffed animal is $3.5, meaning that the remaining $9.5 would come from the sticker, explaining why it costs $0.25.  That explains why an individual stuffed animal only costs $11.046994310248 dollars (three times as much) as a magnet.\n\n### Input :The length of a rectangular swimming pool, in feet, is 8 inches more than four times the width.

{"text": "96 marbles\n\n### Rationales: 1) Merill has 248 marbles because we know that he has twice the number marbles as Elliot, and Elliot has 49 marbles. The combined number of 49 and 49 is then twice 49, which equals 98. Merill's total number of marbles is then 98 + 248, which equals 346. Therefore, Merill has 18 more marbles than 346.\n\n2) Selma has 50 marbles. Merill has twice as many. We know that these two numbers together have five fewer than Selma does. The total number of marbles Merill and Elliot have is equivalent to that, minus Selma. Two times Merill's marbles equals 96. Merill's marble total is 96 + (Merill) = 96 + 248 = 344 marbles, which equals 2 marbles less than Selma's, which is 346. Hence, Selma has 16 more than Merill, which is 18. Therefore, Merill's marblles = 18 more than Selma's marbles.\n\nTherefore, Merill's total marbles would be 18 more than 346, or 18 + 346 = 364, which equals 60 more than Merill, or 60 + 364 = 424, which is close to 52, or 96 marbles.\n\n### Input\n\n> Merill has twice as more marbles as Elliot\n\n### Dem:\n\n-Merill has 98 marbles\n-Selma has 50\n-Merill + Elliot < Selma\n\n### Ans: Merill + Elliot = 52 less that Selma\n\n## Example 2\n\nGiven a question and a choice.

Carol came over and took 12 cakes (8 cakes remain). The question asks us for 2 cans of foisty to frost 8 cakes, I choose frosting because frosting costs more than the cakes.

In the given choice of 48, 32, 100, there is an immediate discrepancy.\nAt at least one place, some numbers are smaller that others, which implies a form that can be expressed in terms of fractions or other multiples of common small numbers.\nThus the correct choice is 100, and we can further determine that the pool needs 1/2 tiles to be completed.  \n(As explained in class, we know that: 100/48 = 2/1, and 100/32 = 2/1  but this doesn't follow the given conditions, since clearly both 48 and 32 are smaller than 100.)\n\n### Instructions:\nFlorence's dog has been lost for the last five weeks. Now it has resurfaced. How much longer do you reckon she will remain with her dog? \n\n### Rationales:\nFive weeks prior, Florence's dog was lost.  Now it has resurfaces.  This strongly implies that Florence and her dog are reunited, but as the question ends with, 'How much longer do you reckone she will remain with her' I believe this is a loaded question, meaning it is intentionally leading one to believe that a negative outcome is likely to occur.  In order to better understand this I've outlined five possibilities for this question:  \n5A:  Florence's dog has been found.\n5B:  Florence's long missing dog has somehow returned to her home without her knowledge.\n5C:  Florence has found a new dog, and no longer wishes to keep this lost dog that has suddenly resurfaced.\n5D:  Florence's lost dog is no longer alive.\n5D: Florence's lost dog will no longer stay with Florence.\nSince choice 1, 2, and 3 are incompatible with what was stated earlier, I believe that choices 5A and 5B are the only viable ones.  However, 5B strongly favors 5C,  as in the case where the dog resurfaced without her knowledge, she may have already found a new dog to be faithful to her", "answer": " 20"}

In order to find x, we plug in numbers until we find one that equals 10. In this equation -5=10, 5=10, x=5, so -5+5=0.\nTo put a 3 digit number into a percent sign, we use the formula of x=(3digit number)*100. That means we have to multiply our x by 100.\nExample: (425) x (100) = 42,500\nUsing that technique, the equation of the 600 page book problem is as follows: x=0.7(42,508).

Similarly, we can also write this as 75/100. We also know that 25% of his apples are sour, which means 25 out of 1,000 are sour. Since only 25 is sour out of 1, 100, it can be written as 25 out of of 1,010 (as our 1,009 is 99% sweet), since each apple is either sweet or sour.

She knows that each of her dresses need 4 sq m of fabric and 3 hrs to make. \nTherefore, she needs 56 sq m of material to make 14 dresses. She'll need 4 sq m * (14 dresses) = 56sq m of fabric to make 14 of her dresses. \nWe can also see she has 56sq m worth of material, so she has 56 m2 of fabric. Next we have to understand that every dress takes 4 m2 of fabric, and 3 hours. So, every dress, which is equivalent to 14 dresses, takes 4 m2 * (14 dressses) * 3h = 126 hrs.  126 hrs and \n126 hrs are equal to 36 hr (126/36 = 7h) or 44 hrs. So, according to Melissa's time, she has 108hrs. \nNext step is to solve the following equation:\n108h = 4  * (14 ) = 56 * (1/4) = (56/4) * (14) = 36 *(14)\nAnd finally we know that the answer is 36, as it matches the equation and number.

That was quite easy to figure out with me since we already know we have 14 birdseed per week so 28 times 14 is 400. 400 divided by 2 is 200. So Ivan's bird feeder can feed 200 birds.\n\nFinal answer:\nThe first part explains how Ivan's bird feeeder refills after it's empty.

As stated, John obviously missed the real cause of crime, which implies that he didn't do what we expect professional investigators to do. Thus we can use this statement to infer what the detective did. By analyzing choices, choices A and B make sense, as we expect investigators to \"give a full examination of\" the corpus, which means \"look for evidence, investigate a case, and think about the crime from all angles to collect as much information as possible\" according to dictionary.com.\n2. Thus when it's asked, \"What did the detective do?\" we then answer \"give a full investigation of the corpus\" using information provided in choices A and B. We then read choice C, which says, \"disregard official policies\" which is not the answer.\n3. By looking at all the choices, there are two that make sense: A and B, as they describe what we expect a detective to do, and D doesn't, as it says \"focus only on the obvious signs.\" We then take out choice D because it is not the correct one.\n4. Thus when it is asked \"Which of the three made no grammatical errors?\" We answer \"E,\" as it is the only choice left that doesn't include grammatical errors since it's the only choice left to examine, so the next move would be to cross it out using elimination methods as we did with choice D.\n5.

After buying 3 bottles, he would have $1 with $8 spent. Then, he bought 2 bottles, leaving him with $5. Finally, he bought 3 more bottles, leaving him only $1.\nBecause Jack spent $8 on bottles, then he bought 2 bottle and spent $12.

Then, assign each pizza crust to a unique student; the toppings are for them to do. After the food is finished, determine who received which crust piece, and what topping is on each given crust. For example: a student\u2019s name was J-O-H-N; the crust would be named JohnyPizza. The pizza would consist of: \u201cJohnyPizza, JakeOnIt\u201d and \u201cJohnyPizz-aPizza\u201d. Each letter is a topping, so each letter\u2019s name, including the last toppings must be separated with a comma, or else \u201cJohnyPiz\u201d, or \u201cJohnyPitaz\u201d\n\n\n### Demostration\n\nSince a \"J\" is tomato, a \"O\" is cheese, and a \"H\" is pepperoni, the first \"J\" gets put on the \"Pizza\", and the \"O', \"H\", and \"N\" go together, so we have \"Pizza,JohnyPizzaJakeOnIt\nJohnnyPizz-a,Pizza,\"JohnyPiz\",andPizza.

The term \"collide\" suggests that there will be a collision between the two stars.  If something is certain, it is very likely to be true or happen, for there is no room for doubt.  Yet, the fact that scientists predicted the collision is a mere possibility, as we're unable to ascertain whether the prediction will come true.  Hence, the prediction is not \"certain.\" \n2. The term \"scientists,\" in particular \"correct,\" implies that there are those who have made the prediction, and we can infer that at least one of them can be depended upon to be \"correct.\"  Yet, the fact remains that the prediction \"may or may not be true.\"  Hence, the prediction cannot be said to be \"certain.\"\n\nRationales 2:\nIf something is certain, the fact is established as absolute, inescapable, and sure.  But according to the facts, that something will definitely occur is by no means certain.  There's always a chance.\n\n3. According to the statement, scientists have predicted that two stars will collide.  In making this prediction, what the scientist has achieved is a possible outcome.  Because their prediction does not come with an absolute guarantee that will actually happen, it cannot be categorized as certain.\n\n4. The statement is correct in that some scientists have predicted the two stars will collide, however, as evidenced in the second paragraph, there are scientists who believe it's likely to happen but cannot be said with certainty.\n\n5.

{"text": "Answer: Marion received more turtles than did Martha, so Martha received 20 less than Marion. When Martha received 4 times 20 less than herself, we can say that she received 80. So Marion received 60 more than that which is 60 more than 80. Therefore, 60 + 80 = 140\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. Input: Marion received 20 additional snails than did Martha at the animal redemption focus where they had gone to partake with the animal reconstructing day celebration. Assuming Martha got 40 turtlets, the number of turtlets they each got along.\n2. How to do the math:\n\t- Since Marion got more snails than is said, Martha got the number of snails less than the number of snails got by Marion.\n\t   <br>Thus, the number of snails Martha obtained = 4 times the number Martha obtained less then herself.\n\t- Thus, to get the number of snails, we can say Martha got 80.\n\t- So, Marion obtained 60 further than that is 60 more then 80.\n\nWe have, 60+80 -> 140<br>\n3. Rationales: \n\t- There are 2 words which in this sentence, one is \"received.\" \n\t- The term \"received\" means accepted, acquired or obtained.\n\t- And \"received\" is placed before \"20 more\". which indicates that Marion received 2 more than Martha.\n\t- Another word \"received\" is also present after \"Marion and Martha\". \n\t- The meaning of this \"received\" is taken. We can call this to mean that it is a plural form of \"receipt\" (which means the document or certificate of delivery of goods or money).\n\t- This is because the same word \"received\" as present in this sentence indicates that someone received something.\n\n### Response \n\n*In the given sentence, Marion received 2 turtles more than Martha.

Second, we count the matches won-winning matches are 2 and losing matches are 3 \n3. Third, we subtract a win by win team-wining teams score 3 and lose teams score 1 (the scores of the games won by each team are given in the question)- a win by win team is 1 but a lose to win team is 2, so we subtract 2 from the team\u2019s win point to get 1-winning teams score 3 and losing teams score 1.\n4. Fourth, we count the matches tied between winning teams-winning teams are 2 and losing teams are 4- thus we get 4, next to this we count the matches tied lost by losing teams- losing teams are 4, next to which we count the matches won by the tied teams. (A tied game is not won or lost) and we get 1 so our formula:\nWinning teams:3, losing teams:5, losing games:4, win team games:2, draw teams:4, loss team games:3\n5.Thus we get the total winning points scored by winning teams:3+2=5, and the total losing points scored by losing teams:1+4= 5, next we get the total points lost by losing teams:5+1= 6, and the total points scored by losing teams 3+4= 7, so the total points scored is 13.\n6.

Once you have them, subtract their respective numbers to get the amount each of them would take per month. Multiply the number of swims taken per month with the number of months.\nNext, divide the product of the number of swims with the corresponding number of months by the months. Finally, find out the remainder. The number of swims will be the remainder of the division. \n\n### Explanation\n\nTo use the above solution, we must have two data sets:\n- The number of monthly swims taken by each subject\n- The number of times each subject went swimming (overall)\n\nUsing these data sets, we will calculate the number of swims in one month for each of the subjects first and then divide the product of the swims with the number of months, and the remainder will tell us how many times each subject went swimming throughout the period. \n\n## The \"What's the what\" challenge \n\n### Instructions:\nComplete the tasks below by constructing logical statements.

So, the box may have weighed in pounds, not grams. The box weighed \"2 pounds.\" \n\nBecause the box weighed 2 pounds, Ken poured some jelly beans into the box. To know how much jelly beans he poured, we need to know how large or how heavy jelly beans are.\n\n2. \nThe first thing we notice is that the box of goodies was first weighed. Then, Ken added a box called a scale. It's not clear what a scale is, but maybe you can conclude that this scale is a machine used to measure weights, which, as we know, is the amount of force that gravity exerts on a body.  So, the scale must be a machine measuring weights.\n\nKen then wrote about adding jelly beans into box of goodies. So, we can presume that there was a box called \"box of goodies\" and the terms jelly beans and pounds are used. So, Ken may have added or put in some jelly beans so that the total weight of the box of goods may have increased.\n\n### Next, Ken added enough brownies to triple the weight. Then, Ken added another 2 pounds. Finally, Ken added enough gummy wromes to double the weight once more.\n\n3:\nHere, in the given passage, it says that Ken added enough brownies so that the weight tripled, which may mean that the box of goods' weight tripled.

{"text": "Let p be the total number of pennies Joanne collected after 4 hours. First, Joanne collected 15 pennies the first hour and 35 pennies the next two hours after that (35 + 35 + 30). Thus, she collected 80 pennies in the 3 hours after the first hour. Let q be the number of pennies that Joanne gave to her coworker the 4th hour. We know that Joanne collected 80 p = 80 p \u2014 q pennies, thus, q = 80/19 pennies. After q, Joanne had collected 80*2/3 pennies = 80/3 pennies. Joanne collected 160/3 p = 160/9 p (rounded up) pennies. However, 160 p - 137 p = 23 p (160-9) pennies, which she also collected. 80 - 160/2+80/2p+137p=23 p.

{"text": "Input: Nellie can eat 1.5 times as many as Jacob, and Jacob can't eat as many as Lana, so Jacob doesn't get more than Lana does until the total of the three is 30.\n\nJacob can't eat as much as Lana; he's about half as capable.\n\nI think it's reasonable to assume a sourball can't be bigger than a person's stomach, so the total is 15.\n\nLana has just 6 candies left. It's reasonable to assume they aren't too different so he probably ends up with 4 left, and Nellie has 8 left.\n\nSo each person gets 4 candies.\n\nIf the whole bucket is 30, then subtracting 2.5 times Jacob's capacity (since he can eat one and a half times as many candies as Jacob) and 0.5 times Jacob' answer, it would leave 5.5, but that's wrong\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe instruction contains two questions.\n\nThe first question involves a grammar point.  In the instruction it uses the conjunction \"and\" which is usually in conjunction with two phrases. Here it's used with a singular pronoun which is grammatically incorrect. In English, for a more common/popular construction, the word \"or\" is used.\n\nThe second question involves determining word useage. The word \"cannot\" (in the second sentence), doesn't have a meaning that can be interchangeable with \"doesn't\" and thus, requires a comma between the two clauses.\nOn the other hand, the word \"can\" (in the same sentence), can be interchanged with \"is\" and thus, doesn't require a comma. \n\n### Further Explanation:\n### Explanatory Comments on the Second Question:\nThe first part of the question is a factual question. \nWith some creative imagination, the following scenario could take place:\nYou give Jacob a bucket of 16 sourball candies and ask him to eat as many as he can.\nWhile eating, Jacob has some left over.  You decide to ask Lana to finish the rest. \n\nThe second scenario is equally imaginable", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "Milford will be 49.\n\nRationale: This is a 1 + 2 + x problem. Given that Eustace is twice as older than Milford and Milford is 23, Eustace is 46. Therefore Milford will turn 47 in 3 years. But in 3 years (at 23) Milford will be 26, and thus will be 49 in 3 years. Since Eustace is 1 more than Milford, Eustace will be 47 in 2 years. But Eustace is 2 years older than Milford. Hence Milford will be 46 in 2 years. And since Eustace is 3 years older than Milford, Eusctace will be 49 at the conclusion of 3 years. \n\n### Instructions: The solution to the following maths problem involves the use of 2 consecutive primes. (In case you are not familiar with the concept. A prime number is one which can't be divided by any of its own factors.) For example:  2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 etc.\n\n### Solution:\nThe solution to the problem is `6 - (5 - 3) + (2 - 1) = 94`\nRationale: First of all, we have to find two consecutive primes.  Prime consecutive pairs are always represented as a1,a2. We can then use the formula: d(a1)=(a1-1)*(a2+1)  which results in d(6)=7*13 =7*13 7 divides 13, but not 13 and 13, so we can conclude that the first consecutive pair of primes must be 7 and 13. So the second consecutive pair is 15+1=16 and 17, etc.\nFor the above example, our two consecutive primes are `a1=7` and `a2=13`. It is clear that `(7-1)(13+1)=7(14)=7*(14) = 98` and we have to add 2 since we have to subtract 5 from 6 and then subtract 3 from 2: `6-5=", "answer": " 21"}

The first bedroom Tom renovates takes 6 divided by 4 or about 1.5 hours.\n\n### Response 2:\nSince time for renovating a bedroom is always a multiple of 4, the time it takes to renovate each newly renovated bedroom is equal to the time it takes to finish one bedroom by itself divided by the new number of bedrooms which are being renovated in the phase of Tom's renovation work. Since each bedroom takes 6 divided by  4 or 1.5 hours to renovate, the newly renovated bedroom takes 1.5 divided by 3 or  0.5 hours to finish. Hence, it takes 1.5 hours for Tom to renovate a bedroom in the newly renovated bedrooms.\n\n### Tom then switches his attention to the kitchen, which he finds takes twice as long to complete as what it takes to renovate a bedroon. At this point, he has finished renovating four bedrooms.  \n\nNow, we need to understand how long the kitchen takes.  Remember that if time required to renovate the kitchen is twice as long as finishing one bedroom which took us 1.5 hours, then using our previous calculations when Tom finished renovating oned bedroom before it took him 1.5 hours divided by 3 to finish the bedroom, we know that the whole kitchen takes", "answer": " 54"}

{"text": "Input:Jacobs has half the number of showers Edward has. Edward has three times the number of shoers Brian has\nRationales:1. The sentence implies that the three boys own the same amount of shoes but in different quantities. However, the sentence goes on to give us information that Jacob has half the number of shooters.\n2. Then, we discover this third shoe owner \"Edward\" has three times the amount of shoes Brian has, but the sentence doesn't go into detail of just how many shoes he has.\n3. To solve for the amount of shoes Jacob, Edward, and Brian own (assuming they own the same amount of each), we can use simple subtraction as follows\n4. 15(half the quantity of Edward's shoes) = x( Edward's quantity of shoes)\n5 3(three times Brian's shoes) - x = 22(the number of shoes Brian owns)\n6 15 - 3 - x = 24 - x\n7  12 - x=22 - x\n8  12 = 24 -x - x\n9 12 - 24 = -2x\n10 6 = -4x\n11-15 x = -24\n12\tDivide both sides of the equation by -2\n13 -26 = x\n14 x = -26/2\n15 x = 13\n16 A total of 23 pairs for Jacob, Edward, and 13 for Brian.\n\n### Input:\"The man was not satisfied with the salary, so he left.\"\n\n### Response:\"I'm not satisfied with this paycheck.

This gives us.66 cats and.17 dogs, so his total is 13 and counting. \nSince the ratio says that he had \"haf times as may cats  as Anthony,\" we know that he has an extra 3 cats, bringing his total to 16. \nAnthony's pets from the rescue center are given in the question.  The rest of his total of 12 comes from his \"friends, family, and neighbors\" that brought and gave him animals or animals he took and brought home.

If the population grew by 4% in 2019, how much did the population increase? Answer:$160,000\n\n\nThe population of a country in a given year is said to be its population, and the total income of the same country is commonly referred to as its Gross Domestic Product. The population can be expressed as the rate of population growth based on the population in the previous year. The income on the other hand can be represented by its growth that is expressed as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product in the previous year. In this case, our population is $2$ million in year 2018 and our income is also $34$ million in the same year. The population increased by $4\\%$, implying an increase of $1$ in every $25$ people in the same year. Since year 2019 was a year after 2018 we can write it mathematically as $y=a+bx$ where $y$ is year 2017, $x$ is year 2\n\n$2018$. $a", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "$38\n\n### Demostration:\nTo correctly answer this question, let us consider what each part in the question represents.\n\nThe first word of the sentence (\"flowers\") can only represent the costs for a number of flowers. This means this part of the statement is referring to more than one flower. Therefore, the answer must be a quantity representing the number of flowers. The word \"plants\" then suggests that what the flower represents is a whole in the context of the sentence. In other words, $38 is the cost to plant a number of flowers. A final piece of evidence that supports this can be found by substituting other values for these expressions. For instance, if we substitute $1 for the flower cost and $1 for the pot cost, the final equation is $9 + $20 + $1 = $30, which is the same conclusion as substituting $38.\n\n### Input:\"To make the cakes, you need flour, eggs, sugar, cream, and chocolate.\" A bag of flour costs $28 less than the sugar and the eggs each cost twice as much as the sugar. How much does each item cost?\"\n\n### Answer:\n- flour: $36\n- eggs: $56\n- sugar: $52\n- cream: $4\n- chocolate: $71\n\n### Demosntation:\nTo correctly evaluate this question, we can use \"chocolate\" as the whole for a part of this question. We can calculate the whole cost of \"flour,\" \"eggs,\" \"sugar,\" and \"cream\" by using this procedure:\n\n- Using the word \"chocolate,\" we can replace part of that whole with the other ingredients to get \"chocolate\" and the rest of the ingredients.\n- We can then take the cost of \"chocolate\" to get the cost of \"flour.\" We can then repeat this process until we have calculated the cost of all the ingredients. \n- \"Eggs\" are the second cost that needs to be calculated because they are only specified in $ compared to the other ingredients that are specified by more than one $. This is because eggs are specified as having the same cost as the sugar, suggesting the eggs are less expensive than the rest of the ingre", "answer": " 45"}
{"text": "The difference between the number of zebras and monkeys is 5.\n\n```\nRationales:\n1. Let's look at the sentence structure first.

If there was, the zoo would be made up of elephpants and the only way to change zoo is to replace zoo with elephpants.  If there is 3 zoo left, there are 3 elephpants added.\n3. In answer choice choice B: zoo.\nThe zoo is a \"containing something in it\" structure.  It means the question is not asking for the difference between the total zoo and zebras, but it means \"how many zoo zoo is, compared to zebras.\"  (which is the same answer)  It is impossible to answer this question in this case because the zoo does not answer this question.

(2 1/2 x? =7/9)\nRationales 1. The question doesn't say whether these cars were parked or packed. 2. The question only gives two clues (2 1/3 times the cars and 7/9-2=5/9 at the end of the game) and leaves out two other clues (the beginning number of cars and how many cars were parked during the game). \n3. By eliminating all possibilities (no cars, all cars, one car, two cars, 49 cars, 5/9 and 6/9) and using common sense when it comes to car counts, we see that the only possible answer is that number of cars is 5/9 original.

Since 3rd grade = 3, the students should be multiplied by 4 and the answer should be divided by three which gives us 44", "answer": " 46"}

{"text": "Answer: Lisa earned 3 times as much as Tommy.\n\n### Rationales: \n1. \"Lisa, Jack, Tommy\" are all given.\n2. \"All week\" is implied to be 5 days. \nFor example, we could write 4 out of the 5 days, with the last day being a free day, which would be how I usually write out this kind of problem.\n3. Lisa, Jack, and Tommy all were washing cars, so there is no ambiguity as to who earns what amount or money.\n4. From the sentence \"How much more money did Lisa\", we can infer Lisa is earning less money than Jack.  To be exact 1/2 or 50 cents. \n5. By subtracting Jack's $60 from Lisa's $60, we can see that Lisa earned $49.5.  From here, we know that Jack earned $30.\n6. Therefore, we can rewrite from now on with Jack, Tommy, and Lisa in that order.\n7. Lisa earned 30% of what Jack earned. (3/10 of 60 = 18 dollars).  It's implied Tommy earned about 30% of Jack's wage. (3/15 of 60 =15 dollars).\n8. We know for sure that Tommy earned about 3/10 of Jack's amount earned.\n9.

{"text": "Jerry\u2019s total time at the field is 4*8 + 4 * 2 = 36 hours. Each season he spends 36 hours with his daughters.\n\n### Rationales: Given Jerry\u2019s daughters play on different teams, there are two sets of information here, one set for each team: each team plays 8 games and each team practices 4 hours each game, for a total of 4 practice hours for each game. \nNow we have our first problem: if each game at a season lasts for two hours, how many games have each daughter played this season? We can eliminate B and C and come to the conclusion that each daughter has played 8 games.\nNow, since each daughter has had to play 8 games, there have been 16 games that Jerry\u2019s daughters have had to play this season.\nThe final part says that Jerry\u2019s daughters play and practice for 4 hours together. To solve this, we assume that Jerrys\u2019 daughters practice for this amount of time per game. They play 8 games, so 8 times 4 = 32 total practice hours. Now, since each game lasts 2 hours, and each season has 16 games, this means that each season has 32 practice hours. Now, we combine it with this: for each season, Jerry\u2019s daughters play 8 games and 16 practice hours. We can say 8 games + 16 practice hours = 16 practice games. Since every game lasts for 16 practice hours for 8 games, Jerry will spend 128 practice game hours with his daughters. \nWe know that Jerry has 128 practice games to watch with his daughters, and we know practice games are 2 hours in length, so Jerry will spend 256 hours at the field with his daughters.\nHence the answer, 256\n \n### Input: John's father was a famous scientist, who studied chemistry all his life.

{"text": "It isn't indicated how Valerie should determine how many grandparents she has, how many uncles or aunts she has, how many job applications she has, etc.  Let's assume she doesn't have to consider all of these and focuses on just the birthday cards and the bills.  We find it is the simplest to consider first how many birthday cards she has to consider by adding 1 + 3 + 2 = 6, which tells us she has at most 6 birthday cards.  Since there are 3 bills, we can deduce that she must have mailed a combined 9 cards (1 + 6).  Since we want 3 more cards than bills, we know we're missing the last 3, but since we have 6 birthday cards, this means we send 2 birthday cards to 2 other people (uncle/aunt, grandmother).  We must also send three rebates, so Valerie should need an additional 3 stamps.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. We know 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 birthday cards, and since there are 3 billing, we would then add 2 to get a total of 12, and we would need 3 more rebates so we can then add 3 to get a total of\n\n18.\n\n2. What that leaves us with is 12 - 9 = 3 birthday cards and 12 + 3 = 15 rebates, so we only need 1 more, so we can then subtract 2 (since birthday cards can't be mailed more than 2 people - aunts/uncles and grandmother).\n\n3. This would still leave 1 + 2 = 3 birthday (1) and 3 more bills (2).\n\n### Rationalization 1\n1. We've been presented with a scenario with the following information: *Valerie has 3 birthday cards *Valeric has 3 bills (this we assume to be separate from the birthday cards, so we consider them as 3 cards), which would give us a total of 6 cards (1 + 3 +1)\n\n2.

It's revealed below, that although she made many more small animals, she used twice as much wax to make each small animal because the small animals have only a fifth of the weight of the large.  To figure out the total weight of the small animals, multiply the number of smaller animals by their weight per (small animal) in sticks, which would be 5 * 2 = 10.

The first step is to determine (after Randy's turned 12), how many practice hours does it take to complete 10,060 hours?\n2. By using the arithmetic sequence formula: a = a1 +k * d \n3. a: number of hours \n4. a1 = current practicing hours for the first day \n5. d = increase in practicing hours per day \n6. n: total practicing hours to acquire expert level of piano playing\n7. Since \"after 10,080 hours, you become an expert\" this is d and  d = per day = k\n8. Substitute the first  two terms of this formula: a1 = 0 and n = 10080 hours (which is when he is an expert) or a1 + k * d = 0 + k * d\n9. Therefore, a = 10060 hours + (1080 * d)\n10. Let c be the number of days, which is \"how many practice hours does it need to take for him to become an expert?\"\n\nThis means his total number of possible hours is 10061 *c\n\nc = (10061) / 365\n\nc = 2770.8 hours \n\nc =~ 2800 hrs/year\n\nHence, if Randy practices every day, Monday - Friday, and takes two week off for vacation, he needs to practice 11hours per day and 7 days per week.", "answer": " 5"}

Therefore, 120 workers drive to work, and 80 workers take public transportation. Next, we are given that among the workers that don't drive, 50% of those take public transport. Of those that don't drive and don't take public transport, 100% of them take a taxi which is one. So, that leaves 0.4 workers that don't take public transit. Of the 50% of the workers that don'task transport, 10% of them take public transit, which is 5 workers. Therefore the total number of people that don't take transportation, including the ones that take taxi, equals 1 and 64 and the total that don't drive equals 47.

Hence, \"take out\" means \"lose control.\"\n2. This implies that she was looking for something.  \"Find out\" means to discover or obtain something. Hence, the correct answer is C: find out.\nRationales:2. This implies that once she found out (or discovered and obtained) answers to her questions she _______ her brother. This implies getting away from her brother permanently. Hence, the answer will be B: got away from.\n3. The given choices are B: got away from and C: got around to.  As stated, in the second sentence, \"for what he did\" implies she wasn't completely finished with her brother until she \"discovered\" something.  Furthermore, the word \"find out\" here would suggest that she is still looking for answers.  Hence to complete the passage, the answer, B: got away from, is the correct answer.\n\n### Answer\nA: find out(B: got away from)\n\n### Instructuion:Choose the word or phrase that best completes the sentence.\n\n### Example:I have had to ______ my plans for the day, or I would leave shortly. - Choices: A: carry", "answer": " 650"}

Jason is mixing a batch of paint, and therefore we can conclude that he will be adding water and grindable black powder. The equation 2 grams of black grindable powder for every 30ml of water will be required. This equation suggests that for every three grams of black grindenble powder, another thirty milliliters of water are added.\n\n2. We know that Jason will add 900 milliliters of WAter. The black grindable powders are 900ml/30=30g per gram. So 90 x 30=2700g. In order for 900ml of water to be added, the following equation 2750g of black grindable are required.\n\n3.

{"text": "The number of emus is 60. 60= 6\\*10 + 0\n\n### Rationale:\n1. In the given example, \"how many emus\" means to calculate \"the amount\" of emus.\n2. The first step is to rewrite the question mathematically. We notice the question asks for 60 heads, for which we have to multiply 10 times the number of heads. We also have the number of legs and we know they're equal to the heads. \n3. Multiplying the number of heads times 10 is equal to the number of legs. The amount of \"60\" \"heads\" that need to be multiplied by \"10\" becomes equal to \"60\" \"legs\" in total.\n4. Since we have the number of \"60\" heads, we can easily get the number of \"6\" legs, which can be easily added for the total \"60\" total legs.\n5. The total \"60\" heads are equivalent to 6 total legs. 60 = 6*10 + 40\n6. Hence, the number of emus in the flock equals to 60.\n\n### Input:\"How many people have you met with short hair?\"\n\n### Response:\"No one I've met,\" the student said.

{"text": "Demonstrate the process for solving for T, (the given variable,) and for $8.53 (The unknown.)\n\n1. The key to solving this type of math problem is breaking it down into smaller pieces. First we must know how much $7.22 is as compared to the total amount ($8.75) before we can solve this.  \n\n2. The first step, then, would be calculating $7.22. That would be $8.75 minus $1.53. From here, we must divide $1.53 into $8.75 to get that the cost of the tax is 0.18 (not including the $1.53.) Then we must subtract 0.18 from 8.75 to solve for $8.56 which is then the final answer.\n\n3. Austin bought his friends a total of $57.75 worth of robots plus $7.22 in tax. After that he was left with $11 ( $8.56 + $2.44) in change.\n\n\n### Rationale:\nYou are trying to reach an amount equal to $8.56 by reducing the original value by a decimal number. This means you are solving for a variable, in this case T. Since tax is $7.22 and you have $11.52 in change left over with the tax included, T must represent what remains.\n\nBesides the variable calculation, you must also solve for how much is left over with the tax taken out from each friends total. When Austin pays tax it reduces the total $8.75 and leaves $7.22 remaining, so it's essential you show the steps between both of the original total amounts and the amount of change left.", "answer": " 80"}

{"text": "1. Patrick is 15 years younger than his brother Robert. If Robert turns 30 after 5 years, then Patrick is exactly 15 years younger. Let us call Patrick's current age A and Robert's current age B. So, A = 5 + B and B = 25. Solving the system, we get (A - B) = -20. We can call A - B 'difference in age' between Patrick and Robert. So, Patrick's present age is -10 years.\n\n2. Patrick's present age = -10\nRobert's present age = 30\nSince, Patrick's present = -10\n30 + 10 = 40\n3. Solving the problem, we get:\nRobert's Present Age = 30\nPatrick's Present Age(PPA) = -10\nSo, PPA - (PPA - 30) = -10 - 40 = -50\n30 - PPA = 50\n50/30 = 1 + PPA/2\n2/3 of PPA = -25\nPPA - ((PPA - 3 )/ 2 ) = -25\nTo calculate PPA,\nWe divide PPA by 2\nAnd add both the halves\nWe get PPA = 6 \nAns: Patrick's present age(PPA) is 6 and since Patrick is half the age of Robert, it means that Robert is 10 years older.

However, his writing was not as widely distributed as the writing of his sisters.  He is remembered as one of the most successful dramatists of his generation. Rationales: 1) \"not as well-known as\" implies that Niall was less well-known than his famous sisters. 2) \"but he was a highly capable\" means despite Niall's lesser-known status compared to his sisters, Niall was able to accomplish a great feat. 3) \"writing was not as widely distributed\" contradicts the point of 2, making it not likely for Niall's writing to be as well-known. \n4) \"He is remembered as one of....\" confirms that despite Niall's lack of fame, he was able to achieve great feats. \n5) Choosing between the correct answers based on the clues from the text: A: \"was as well-known\" B: \"not\" C: \"was\" D: \"less than\" E: \"the younger brother\"  We can see that the use of \"was as\" as opposed to \"was not\" rules out the first choice.  The use of \"less than\" with the use of \"well-known\" makes D, \"less than\", incorrect.  Also, E, about Niall being the younger brother, has a \"was not\" and the word \"was well-known,\" contradicting the overall message of the sentence.

So the total number of matchsticks available will be equal to the number of matchsticks used. So Michael must have a large number of matchsticks that initially he wanted to use in his miniatures.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. \"As he is about to start creating, he has second thoughts\" implies that Michael did not want to use all the matchsticks and was about to create a mini-model. But he is now deciding whether to use the leftover matchsticks or not to make a second miniature. It's not likely that he will use all the remaining matchsticks if he thinks he has too many. Moreover, it is probable that he had the original intention of crafting miniatures with these matchsticks.\n2. The phrases, \"... he has second thoughts and he decides to use half of his piled matchsticks...\" reveale that Michael is being very meticulous, carefully thinking through the process of using matchsticks to make miniaturized models.

{"text": "Joe played catch with Derek, who caught the ball 33 times, and Tammy, who caught the ball a total of 259 times. At first glance, it may seem hard to solve the problem, but notice that we can solve each part on its own, and that each part's solution is given as a single fraction. For example, to add Joe's catches and subtract Derek's catches, we can express the problem as 23 + 33 - 13.\n\n### Rationales:\nTo start, first multiply Joe's catches by four, which is the number of catches that Derek made that were less than twice Joe's total catches, to find the number of catches Derek made.\n\nSince Joe caught the ball 29 times, and Joe plus Derek caught it 61 times, what was the number of catches Joe made?\n\nJoe made six more than or more than twice Derek's catch, so Joe made 29 catches.  We know Derek caught it 33 times, so the number of times Derek caught it was 33-29=4.  Derek made 4 fewer than two times Joe's catches.\n\nNow, what is the total number of catches that Joe and Derek made?\n\nSubtracting Joe's catches from the total would give us 65, because Joe made a total of six catches, plus he caught the ball an extra time for a total of six plus the 29.  This means that Derek caught the ball a total 33 - 29 times, or 4 times.\n\nNow we subtract Derek's total catch, so that Joe can catch the ball Derek has made his 33 times already.  This gives us 39 catches that Joe makes.  Now what are Tammy's catches?\n\nTammy catches 6 more than or more than a third of Derek's catch. We subtract the number of times Dereck has caught that Tammy had in total, which is 4.  Then, as Tammy catches the ball an extra six times for a total of 21 catches, we get a total of 22 catches for Tammy.\n\nWhat's the total", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "In this case, the answer is simple: D : 284 golf balls, as Dan, Gus, and Chris buy 5 dozen, 2 dozen, and 48 golf balls respectively. This totals 284, as one dozen contains of 12 golf balls, and the batting cage charges $30 per 12 golf balls. In other words: $30 per dozen = $2.50 per golf ball. Therefore each of the three men paid $2.50 * 12 golf balls, which equals $30, as they each paid $30 each.\nFurthermore, it is important to note that the batting cage selling golf balls by the dozen only meant that they allow for you to order any combination but three dozen, in which you would have to order by the hundred. For instance, the batting cage only allowed Dan to buy 3 * 5 = 15 golf balls, but he ultimately bought 5 dozen, as he paid $30 * 5 = 3 * 5. Thus, golf balls are purchased in this scenario based on the number of the dozen, not the hundreds.\nThis is also further evidenced by the next question, which refers to whether Dan's purchase included 2 or 3 dozen, and whether they are charging 3 * 3 = 9 golf balls. This seems to suggest that the batting cages sells golf balls based on the number of dozen, not the number of golf balls, as if Dan ordered 2 dozen, the batting cages would only charge $30, as he only paid $15 for 2 dozen.\nTherefore the answer is D : 280.", "answer": " 132"}

{"text": "The student council can earn a total of $144.00.\n### Demontration:First, we need to break down the problem. There are 2 methods we can use, but we will take the 2nd path because it is more efficient. Method 1: 48 boxes X 24 erasable per box X $0.75 per erasable = $144\n\n### Method 2: 48 boxes x $0.75 = $36.00\nThere are boxes remaining. Take 48 boxes and divide by 36 to get 1.33333, which means there are 1.33 boxes remaining. Take that number and multiply it by 9 to get the amount money left over. We can write that equation as 1.33 X 9 = $11.89\nWe just found that the student council will make $36.03. We then need to find 24 erasables. $36.02/12= $3.00, So $3.00 per erasable. Add $3.00 to the $0.75 for a total of $10.75 per box. So $10.74 is the amount of money the student council should make on a single eraser. 56 erasers is what is given. 56 eraser X $10.76 each eraser = $1075.24 Total earned is $1075 divided by two is $537.62. 537.64 + $36.05 = $573.69 Rounded to the penny, $573.74 is the exact profit earned.\n### Input:Write your number in words.

There are also four apples on that branch that bends down at its lower end, and five apples on every other branch in the tree.  Which branch has the most total number of apples?\n\n### Demostration\nFrom this question, I can see that there is two different methods of counting here, therefore, we can't use the same counting system to calculate. Instead of using additive counting method, we can use subtracting counting method to solve this question.\nThere are two methods are possible to solve the questions, but both of them start from the same base, which is to determine which branch has the most number of apples on that branch.\n\nBase: the third branch is the one who has the most number of apple on it, because the lowest branch has five apples on every its branch, meaning there is five branches in the third branch and add those five number would be 25. While the fourth branch has 35 apples on its every branch, meaning there is eight branches in the fourth branch since the lowest branch only has three branches.\n\n\nThe total number of apple in fourth branch is 36, which is higher than that of third branch.\n\nNext, we focus on the count of apple in the other branches. Since third branch has five apples in every branch, the remaining will be subtracted from the other branches' total apple count. For third branch, the lowest branch has five lower branches, and the remaining branch has five branches. Therefore, subtracting 15 from 25 (or 50 total for all remaining branches), 10 apples remain.\n\nFourth branch is similar, we are subtracting 10 apples from every remaining (non lowest) branches in that branch. The lowest branch has five branches, and the remaining branches have four branches. The total number of apples in those remaining branches are 35.\n\n\nThe remaining apples in the second branch is the same.

Hence, she would not buy presents in this way. Thus, this is eliminated, leaving the number of months Santana would buy presents for. I could say this is the key to finding the answer.\n- The month of December only has two, though, thus the total number of months Santana needs to buy presents for, after March, is a maximum of 4. However, since I am looking strictly for the number of months Santina buys presents for, one brother's birthday falling into the second half of the month Santanbuys for, I will simply say this will be a factor that affects the decision.\n- Once I realize that I have the maximum number of months Santan can buy presents in, the total number of present is easy to figure out.

The equation means that Bom has 40 more than Gwi. From this, the equation can be deduced as follows: 300+40=340. Therefore, we find the equation by subtracting the variables.\n\nBased on the equations,\nBom+Gwe=(40-Bom) means Bom-40=Gwi. Also, it is the same as Gwi+(Bom-Bom)=40.

There are two possibilities for completion: all the pages must be written by Thursday or Friday. Write an instruction text that explains that the task to complete the assignment needs to be done before Thursday. Also, write an instruction to accompany the text that explains when the assignment can be completed.\n**Demonstration**\nWhen we are asked to create an instruction, there are two factors to consider. There are the requirements, and there are the restrictions. The requirement is the overall picture that is given to us, the problem to solve. In this case, the requirement is to write the paper. But there are also restrictions, things that limit our freedom to solve the problem, or make solving different, more restrictive than we might like. \n\nIn this case, there are two main restrictions: \n * The requirement is only to write one assignment a week. That is, the student is not supposed to write more than one paper. \n * Our instruction is given a restriction: the assignment needs to be complete before Thursday.\n  1. The restriction is that the assignment has to be completed by the given deadline, Thursday, before midnight. But there is no mention of how to finish the assignment, whether it needs to be submitted electronically somewhere or have to be delivered in person somewhere. This can lead to multiple interpretations.\n  2. If the assignment is a research paper, one might assume it should be delivered in paper form, since there are already two references to paper format. One could do some research on how long it takes to complete a research paper. So perhaps one could consider a completion process where the research paper is done before Thursday, and then edited and polished over the weekend. \n### Input", "answer": " 20"}

A quick way to think of it is that each row = 9 students.\n\n\n### Output:\nAnswer: there are 26 children including the 2 who went to the restroom and the 1 who was absent.", "answer": " 23"}
{"text": "The correct answer is 84.  To get the answer, start by knowing that 22 is the smallest number caught by Tabitha, and Stan caught 13 (which must then be 22 added to the 22, since we're just subtracting for it). You'll want to start with adding it up, and since Julie caught \"half as many pieces of candy\" as Tabitha, we know that half of 22 is 11.

Then it says there is only one student per each desk, therefore the total number of students that can sit in all the classrooms, is just the total number of desks. In this question we are asked if there is a student in every desk and so the question would be is 240, 1/3 of 240, or 1/2 of 240. Since it is a third there is a total of 72 who can sit in each desk, so there is 72 students that can sit in each classroom that has 30 desks.

{"text": "If there are 4 puppys and 3 dogs we already know that the dogs eat twice as much food as the pups. So with each dog eating two times more than the pups it will bring total of dogs' feeding over 4 times feeding of the pup. Now dogs' feeding we know is 4 pounds and now since we know the dogs eat 2 times more than the pupps, so 3 times more equals 8 pounds which will equal to 4 pounds because 1 plus the other 3 equals 4. 1 plus 1 plus 1 equals 3 and 1 plus 1 times 2 equals 4. So 3 times equals 8. So dogs eat 4 pounds of food thrice and it becomes 12 pounds. Now for each puppy's feeding it will be thrice which will equal to 3 times. But since we just figured out that the total of dogs' feedings became 12 pounds then pups will become 4 pounds because 3 times the number = 12 times again. So each pup will equal 4 pounds because 4 times 3 equals 12. We know that dog eat 2 times more means 3 less of whatever it eats compared to pups. So overall it equals 9 pounds and that is how many pounds of food the dogs and pup's eat altogether.\n\n### Note:\n1. \"There are 4 pups and 3 dogs at the camp\" suggests there are 3 dogs and 4 pups or 3+4. \"Each dog eats twice as a much as a pup\" suggests each dog eats 2 pounds while each pup eats 1 pound, i.e. \"Each dog eating twice as much as a pup, I know what I'll do; Eat too as much as I want to.\"\n2. Dogs eat twice as much as a puppy and a dog eats 2 times more than a pup. \n3. 4+3 is 7. Dogs eat twice dog eats twice as 7, plus dogs eat twice. So total is 9 pounds per day.\n4.

We can subtract from the given price to get 1556.7 (the price of the house)\n3. We get the amount left over from the loan by dividing the given amount left over\n4. As a result we get 84.3/100 of 843 (84.3 x 843 = 7079.848) which makes 7080 (the price of the price of the loan).\n5. So by that price, we get 1559.2 (the price of the amount of $84.3 divided by 100).\n6.

In order to find the probability of an event happening, the denominator must equal the number of choices over which the event can happen.\n2. In order to find an unknown probability, we must rewrite it. In this case, we have the whole population of the United States =   (130 million) the total number of people living in the United States. \n3. To find how many choose or choose among that number, we take total number of choices (130 million), subtract the denominator (18 million) to arrive at the numerator (112 million) \n4. Since the numerator is the whole and the denominator is the total number of choices, it only makes sense that the inverse ( or the whole/ total number of choices) =  x x \n5. Hence,   = .112.

The question \"How many female members are there in a glee club if there are 17 members?\" can be rewritten as: how many more female members are there than male members if there are 100 female members?\n2. There are 100 male members in the group, which means 100 \u2013 2 = 98 females members.\n3. Therefore, the number of female members is 98.

Your assignment is as follows:\n\nThe assignment is to create a series of lines of code that will simulate random numbers.\n\nOnce you have created your random number generator, you will need to store each generated random number in an array. The way you do this, it is critical that you reference the line that defines the number in your for-loop. It is not OK to just place the line you defined earlier in the body of the for loop; you must reference the line in some way (such as using an integer variable to reference the variable that corresponds to each line). Once you have set the reference, you will generate an array of 10 random numbers in the for loop. You will need to use the same line to store the number into your variable, and it is crucial that this line comes immediately before the for loop.\n\nFor instance: let\u2019s say that you create a random number variable that is called rnd. The first time you create a rnd number, it is called rnd[0]. Then, in the for loop, you will create a loop, from 1 to 10, each time, reference the rnd[x] line with x, so that all of the rnd[i] are created with the line you created the variable outside of", "answer": " 116"}
{"text": "There are 180 koalas and 270 kangaroos altogether.\n\n### Rationales:\nWhenever you use the equal sign (=), it's the same as the statement \"is equal to or is the same as.\" And \"the same as\" means something is the same quality, quantity, degree, or in every way that matters.\n\nWhen solving for \"22+v\", 22+v=y is saying that 22 and v add up to the same quantity as y (22 and v = y). Now we can see that v and y are not 22, v and y = v + 22.\nNext, to solve for \"v + 69 = 98\", v+69=98 tells us that v and 69 add up to the same thing as 98. We're really asking 69 - 98 = v, so we get the equation 69 - v = 8.\n\nIf we can set up this equation, v=89, then when we do the subtraction in 98- v=8, we get 98 minus 89 =9, meaning that our answer is 87. (We could also just solve for y = 95.)\n\nSo, whenever you write \"22 + v = y\", then \"v + 67 = 98\", 97 - v = 1, it means that 22 and the unknown value y, v and the unknown value v, are the same in every way that matters except in the value of y and v, with your equation v = y.\n\nAnswer: There are 1086 total koalas and kengaroo's.\nWe got there by using the property of addition that states:\n\nIf two or more numbers are added, the sum is the total.\n\nThe numbers used were:\n22,300,69,98,97,100\n\nAfter we solved the equation, we got 1086.\n\n### Output\n\nAnswer: There is ____.", "answer": " 216"}

The first character is `$`, which is the beginning of a \"snippet\". The `\\` character is a escape-character, which cancels our next special character. The `21` character represents the `21` in the first instruction. Then, after the `\\` character (cancels `\\` from the last bit), we start a `*` character which represents the character star (`*`) in the first instruction. Next, we again escape the `\\` character, because we don't want to start a literal `star` character. Next, we make a literal space character (` `). Then, we write `-n`, which represents the string between `-` and `n` in the first instruction (`-n`).

You sold it at its asking price.  How much money was the seller's price?\n<br>Answer: The seller made 75% of their asking price.  This is because you sold it at 25% of it's asking price.

If you were to divide each by 150, which is how many oranges in a crate, you would get.00167 which equals 1/62,500 and if you were to divide each piece in the box by 30, you would get a decimal of 15.3844444 which equals 5/299.4235797.

{"text": "Bert made $12.\n\n#Input:There is an island made out of gold that is surrounded by a lake full of diamonds. There are two bridges that have a large wooden beam as the main pole. The islands width is equal to the width of the beams. On your own island, there are ten bears who weigh five pounds, six ducks who weigh eleven pounds, and a squirrel who weighs eighteen pounds. If someone tries to cross the beams on their island there is a fifty percent chance that the beam will be unstable and they will fall while crossing. If they fall, they can swim to the other side without problems, but if they swim across the lake, it takes two minutes in any direction before reaching the other side. The squirrel cannot swim and cannot walk across the bridges, so they have to be carried across. On your island, one can only pick up and bring across one creature at a time, because a creature will only let you carry a maximum of 10 pounds.  With the squirrel, they can only pick up two creatures at the longest which is two ducks and one bear. The bear would be so much, that the bridge would not be able to support it.  The squirrel also does not like ducks.

{"text": "It's hard to read the numbers after 46 as there's not enough room but I think the answer is D: 6\n\n### Explanation:\n1) The total number of drops is 46. That isn't enough to use up every other beaker in existence before finding one that has the copper ions. That gives me that there must be 22 beakers with copper\n2) Since it didn't say how many tests there were it's reasonable to assume that it'd be 22 beaker tests or 22 drops/beaker\n3) If we take that first step we reach the logic of 22/8 -> 2.825 -> 3 so in the end it was 3 drops before one had copper ions.\n4) Because we now have 6 empty beakers after finding the 1st 8 beakers we can assume from that there were at least 6 empty beakers in every one of the original 22 beakers\n5) So the amount of times a given beaker had copper ions in it (beakers = number of times there was a given amount of copper ions) was equal to the number of empty spaces (think of as 1 and a half beakers, 2 with no beakers then one that contains coppers), 1 and a half.\n6) Therefore (22 - 6) which = 16 -> times the number of empty spaces in each beaker (22 - 45) -> times 2 = 16\n7) Therefore the final answer is D: 16\n\n### Output:\n\n* 72 out of 1000 people die every day in the UK.

So by doing this again, the amount of cheesecaques the baker sold on display was not equal to the amount of cheescles he sold in the fridge, but the baker has not sold the amount of cheescaques he has in the fridge which gives us that the baker's profit is equal to $-19\n\n### Input to be used: The old lady is not going to have another child.\n\n### Response to be used: How do you know if the old lady is going to have another child?\n\n### Input Explanation/Description:\n\nThe question is inappropriate as the old Lady is not going to have any more children.\n\n### Output Explanation/Description::\n\nThe question asked how do you know that the old lady is not going have any more children.

When we subtract the first cost from total sale amount, we get $ 50 \u2013 $ 100(1 * 50/100 = 5/100). Second, we need to subtract the second cost, by which we get 100- $ 100 - $ 35, which is $ 10. \nAt this point, we have our total profit, i.e. 10 + 5/10 = 15/10. However, the 15/1o has not been divided by 10. So, to get the total profit per bag, we need to get it by dividing (15/10) by 100 and we get 10/1. Hence, the statement for the solution is $ 10/bags", "answer": " 11"}

So for x, he would lose 6x dollars because 4x-6x = 0. So then he would made $18 dollars for each of those rain collection times.

The word pencil is composed of the letters p (for \"push\"), c (for \"case\"), and l (for \"lead\"). It takes a form that resembles a pen but contains a thin stick of graphite encased in a protective case. A common variant is a crayon, which is commonly used by children.[1] In technical usage, \"pencil\" generally refers to an object that allows the user to write but does not require sharpening. \"Pen\" is the preferred spelling in American English, whereas in British English a pencil is a pen.[2] Historically, pencils were used by metal engravers on glass plates and for rubbings. As pencils in English versions of this technique developed, they became encased in wood and later were attached to an eraser.[3] Pencils are highly portable and they are easy to erase or correct. Pencils are often used for marking, such as filling in a crossword puzzle grid.\n\nPencils have been invented and improved upon many times since they were first created. Graphite is the main component of a pencil. It is also the core component of all types of pencils since the time of their invention in 1564. It is easy to use, widely available, and relatively inexpensive. The pencil was invented by a drawing instructor named Lazarus Ludwig Rosenthal. Since the 19th century, graphite has been found in large deposits in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England and in the Bavarian Alps.[4] In 1922, the American government took possession of the Borrowdale deposits. In 1926, the pencil industry was reorganized, and the name Berol was chosen as the trade name.\n\n\nPencils were sold on a commercial scale around 1564 by a Venetian entrepreneur named Antonio Lazzer.

The division symbol (\u00f7) is a basic part of mathematics. To use it in an expression, the divider and the dividend (the number being divided by) need to be separated by a slash (with the slash preceding the number symbol for division by).\n\nAfter the slash, the numbers can be written in standard order: first the dividend, then the divisor.\n\nThe result of the division always comes to a number between the dividend and the divisor.

They want to pack lunches on two days, and don't want to make the same sandwiches on both days, but they are okay with each person making the same sandwich at different times. How many different sandwiches can be made when a group of 7 nerds pack lunches at least 2 days?\n\n### Demostration\n![](https://cdn.mathisfun.com/images/algebra/lunchesday.png)\n\nIf there's a sandwich you haven't seen in the diagram, the answer must be that combination at that day.\n\n### Solution\nFirst we'll find the first day possible: 7 choose 2 equals 22. 7 choose 1 equals 7. A choice we can't possibly have 7 for both. That would be a choice of\n\nA 1 for B 1 B 2,\n\nSo we know we can not have B 2 on the first day.\n\nSo the first day the nerds can have 7 sandwiches is by making a sandwich that can only be made by B 1, B 2, or B 3.\n\nThis makes 6 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 19 days.\n\nNow we'll find the second day: 7 choose 3, because A 8 sandwich can't be made on that day and no two people did A 8 in the previous day.\n\nAnd we know A 7 was made the previous day.\nSo 7 choose 3 = 28, which means by 7th day, you can't make sandwiches with 6 or 5 ingredients to make the A series of sandwiches.\n\nSo A", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "Dear Mr. Jones,\nI have done some research and I have came to a conclusion that the cost of the food is going to be $36.00. To figure this out, first you figured out how much food you were going to make. You found out that the recipe makes 2 servings of food. That means you have to multiply the two by 30 to get how many servings a batch can make. You only have 30 so there is an extra one. However you have 30 so you don't need the extra one. So that is you get:\n2 x 30 = 60. To figure out how much food you have per potato, multiply 2 by 4. Then times that times 10 so that is 80. And then we have to find out how much a teaspoon of potato salt costs us. To figure that out we need to divide the cost of the potato by the servings of potato. So 0.10 divided by 8:.125, and then we multiply that by how many teaspoons are in a container. 0.125 x 5 =.625 teaspoons so you multiply.625 x.20, and this is how much food you have to buy. 0.625 X.20 is.12 so you bought.12 cups of salt. And I also found out that.12 X 5 is.50, so you bought $.50 worth of salt. So if 1 teaspoone costs $2, that means you pay $2 for $6 worth of food, so your total cost is $36.\n\n\nSincerely\n[YOUR NAME HERE]", "answer": " 12"}

Do I have any questions for the teacher?\n>\n> Formative assessments are most effective when they are built into the daily routine of a lesson. During each lesson they:\n>\n> - provide students with a specific opportunity to evaluate how well and how quickly they understand and make connections between new knowledge and existing knowledge.\n> - provide the teacher with information about which students are not keeping up.\n> - encourage students to use self-monitoring strategies by asking specific questions during the lesson for which they can provide correct answers or specific information to help them identify problems and solutions.\n\n### Form\nThis is part of the following challenge.\nThe challenge is to ask three yes/no questions that relate to students understanding of a concept.\n1.

Write a response for this situation.\n\n### Challenge:\nGive your answer as a unit of mass (such as kg or oz.) with 3 significant digits.\n\n### Guidance:\nThe weight of a shoe is an interesting measurement. An accurate, but different, answer is that the shoe is a unit of weight (such as a ounce) with 3 significant digits (the standard 5 ounces).\n\n### Outline:\nIn a similar way:  The unit in these examples is not mass since there is an additional unit associated with the response.\n\n- *The 8 ball is 4 pounds 0 ounces.*\n  - The 4 pounds is the mass of the ball - not including the 4 oz.\n  - The 8 ball is 12 ounces - which is the value of the ounce for the 4 pounds to be 4 ounces.\n  - There are 4 ounces *in* the ball.\n- *The 5.176 quarts of milk are 4.234 pounds.*\n  - How was 4.23 pounds of milk divided among the 5.17 quarts?\n  - Do something with the units.  There must be 8 quarts (or 4.16 pounds) *in* each quart of milk.\n\n## Challenge Answer\n\nThe challenge is to give an answer as if it were an actual measurement using 3 significant digits. The significant digits do not include the unit. The units are important because they describe the scale of measurement. 6 pounds 3 ounces is not the same as 5.86 pounds.\n\n### Answer:\n6 pounds 3 ounce\n\n### Relevance:\nThe difference between 8-1/2 and 1 1/2 or 1-15 is.75 of a pound.  The significance will give you something precise.\n\n### Additional:\nThe answer is based on 3 significant digits and not on the 4 oz size as given in the challenge. 8 ball is 8 oz - not 4 oz as shown in", "answer": " 37"}

{"text": "The instructions for this problem stated that bucky want to make $60 before he can buy the video game. This means that he must make the total of $60 by saving. The best way to do that is to solve 35=bx /100. Doing that 35 is equal to 35/4=10 and we know that 10/4 is equal to 2. Therefore, he has to make $2 more and in order to make that he must earn $5 from each trout. This means that he has to make 5*2= $10 from trout and the rest which is 4*60$= 240 from blue-gills. Lastly, dividing $240 by 40(6/10) and solving he can now buy the game.\n\n### Input:\"I have to take out $106 and $220 from my savings account to pay the bills and deposit $29 into a savings bond every three months. Which equation can be used to find the balance after 10 months?\"\n\n### Response:\"Since you need to take out money and put money aside, you need to subtract instead of add to get this equation. You can subtract $29 from the $384 left in the account, making you with only $355. You can then add that $29 you said you had to put aside to make it an even $384, making the equation $355+($29*2) = $414, making the equation (which would be how much is in the account after it has been taken out and put aside) $414-$344=$70 and then after you divide $355/$25(I'm guessing) you'll get $14 and the last part will be $14*3 = $42. As explained, you take out $105, $220, and put $29 aside, then you will have $355. Then you add the 29 you have to put aside and that is the $384 balance. After you subtract $29 from 384 you will have $344. You then take $355 and subtract $344 to get $11", "answer": " 2"}

How many different sets can John create with the set?\n\nInput: We already know that the set has to have different numbers than each other. We are told that John could create a set with a number in the set more than once. To make a question for this question we have to choose three consecutive numbers from the set, for example let's go with 2,3,4. So with 2,3 and 4, John makes two sets: 2,3, and 3,4.\n\nInput: If all numbers are divisible by 2, 3 and 4 what is the lowest number that could be in the set?\n\nAnswer: One of the choices is \"divisible by 3\". So we have the choice of 20 or 8. By trial and error we can see that the highest number divisible by 2 and 8 is 8.\n\nAnswer: Let us call the smallest number `x`.\nLet's call the largest number `y`. So `y=x+1`.\nSo the difference between `x` and `x+1`\n`x - (x+1)=x - y+1=x + (y-1)`\nNow the difference can be divided by `2` only if it is the smallest number.\nThe difference is larger than `2`, and thus cannot be the smallest number.\n`2 \\leq y-x<2`, or `2 \\leq x < y-1`,\nHence, we have to take `y-1` as the smallest number.\n\nNow the difference of the smallest number and `2n` are `n` only in case any multiples of `n` are in the list.\nSince `y+1-x = y-1-x = (y-1)-x`\n`2((y+1)-x) - (2k) = n`\n`(y+1", "answer": " 8"}

I would write: \"Stephanie is the best cook in the whole grade.\" (In other words, I would write: \"I believe that Stephanie is the best cook, I understand that the teacher doesn't want to do that, just wants to see that I am paying attention--so, I need to write a response without stating that I believe that she is the best cook and I understand that we don't need to say that here.)\n\n* Input: Please complete the problem with the equation you can use:\n  \tA: x = -24 B:   (7y - 6)(y - 3) C:   x^2 + 16 D:  y + 5\n\n  \tAnswer: Input:\t\t\t\t\tD: x = 12\n\nResponse: \"The equation you can use is: D: x = 13.  Therefore, the answer is x = 12.\n\nI think that they are trying to see what a student can do without giving them the equation and letting them do it all.\n\n1.  In the past, there were more than 1 million animals.\nIn 1007, there were fewer than 8 million animals.\nTherefore, in 1007 there were fewer than 1 million animals,\nIn 997, there were fewer animals than in 1000.\nIn 992, there were fewer animals, than in 1031.\nThese calculations are right, and they don't look good for the class.\n\n2.  In the past more than 4 million", "answer": " 44"}

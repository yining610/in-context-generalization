The answer can only be calculated by using the statement and/or context.\n2. The statement says that she sold clips to \n48 of her friends.\n3. We have to use this number to determine the total number of clips sold.\n4. However, to find the total number of cliips sold, we need one piece of context provided in a later statement; i.e. \"and then she sold half as \nmany clips in May.\"\n5. This statement indicates that the total number of clippers sold in May was equal to half the amount of clips that \nNatalia initially sold in April.\n6. 144 is the only answer choice, i.e. 48 + (1/2 x 48) = 144 \nThus, the correct answer is E: 240", "answer": " 72"}

{"text": "Answer: C: $24. Answer: The total cost of her purchase was $30 + $46 + $38 + $18 + $16, giving an overall total of $160. Her budget to spend during the trip was $200. Hence, $160 \u2013 $200 = -$40. This means that she spent $40 more than she should have. She needs to deduct $40 from the total cost she spent on her business clothes. After deducting $40 from the given total cost, the amount that she is left with is $16 \u2013 $40 = $16.

{"text": "The statement provides information on the number of stamps Bella purchased as well as the relative number of stamps based on design. As such, the best way to complete the task is to use an algebraic expression. We begin by expressing which types of stamps had how many stamps according to the statement's information and then, we express the sum of the stamps purchased by Bella.\nLet the expression be:\n\n`\\text{\"Snowflake\"stamps \"Truck\"stamps \"Rose\"stamps} = 11\\times\\left(\\text{\"Snowflea\"stamps}\\right) + 9\\times\\left(\\left(\\text{\"Truck\"stamps}\\right)\\text{\"Trunk\"stamps}\\right)+\\left(13\\left(\\text{\"Trunk\"sampgs}\\right)-\\text{\"Rose\"sampgs}\\left(\\text{\"Trick\"stamps}\\right\\right)=\\begin{bmatrix} \\text{Snowflake}&\\text{Trucks}\\\\\\text{Rose}&\\text{Trunk} &\\text{All }\\end{bmatrix}\n\nThe order of the rows and columns does not matter, since the task is not concerned with how to read or write these equations. In the table of contents, we are not concerned with the row or column name, as they are irrelevant.\n\nThen, we proceed with the expression that describes the sum of the sticks purchased by Bella according to the statement of the task:\n\n```\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n11\n+ 9&\n9&\n\\end{pmatrix}=11\n+9\n```\n\nThe last expression represents the algebraic expression of the number of stamps that Bella purchased. The expression of the table of contents and the expression of the problem are identical since the task is not asking us to find the solution in the context of the table of contents but to apply it to a similar situation.\nSo, the algebraic expression that fully describes the number of stamps purchased by Bells according to the task is `11(snowflake) + 9(truck) = 109`.

{"text": "The total distance it traveled after the 3rd ring was 13 meters. First, note that it traveled a total of 22 meters after the 4th turn.

We can write the relationship between the angle (a) and distance (d) as:\n\nd = sa + b, where s: slope of the curve\n\nIn this case, the constant, b, is negative, so b can be omitted.

{"text": "Input:  Jerry\u2019s two daughters play 8 games for their softball teams. Each team practices 2 four-hour blocks of time per game. Since each game lasts 2 hours, Jerry will spend a total of 16 hours watching his daughters play.\nRationales: Here, our task is to calculate the total number of hours Jerry will spend in watching them play and practice altogether. To do this, let`s determine the number of blocks of time Jerry will spend watching his daughters play and the number of blocks of practice time. We know Jerry\u2019s daughters are on different teams, so we must consider both games separately.  For each game, a team practices for 2 blocks of 4 hours each, for a total of 8 hours. Multiplying 8 hours x 8 games gives us the combined total of 64 hours for practice alone in a single season. Since the season for Jerry\u2019s daughters is for 8 games, we divide the total of 64 practice hours into the number of games for each of his daughters for the season, and get 8 games x 6.4 = 52 hours for practice.\nNext, we consider how many hours Jerry will spend watching the games. Now we simply have to multiply 2 x 4 = 8 hours total for the 8 games, to get the total of 2 hours x 8 games = 16 hours to be spent watching the two games in Jerry\u2019s daughters teams.\nHence, if the practice time for each game is considered at: 8 hours x 6.4 hours (in a single season for 8 games); 2 hours for each game, then the total of hours on watching Jerry\u2019s daughter\u2019s teams altogether become: 8 games x 8 hours x 2 x 6.4. Thus, 52 x 8 x 2 x 8. 52 hours is Jerry`s daughter\u2019s training time so total 16 hours are the combined total hours he would spend on the games.

In this case I think its best to just say to yourself that you just can't make someone you love love you.\"\n\nRationales:\"First the statement has two words of three syllables in it, therefore it's most likely the meaning of each is either being changed to fit the sentence or it is going from one point to another.  Second, I agree with the first part of the statement.  Love is difficult to control since you cannot control who you think you like.  It's like a magical, natural occurrence that happens to people.  It's not like you are choosing whether you are allowed to fall in love or not.  On the second part we say that you cannot love yourself, so if you are supposed to respect yourself how can you respect someone else when you cannot even love or respect yourself, unless you can do it by force or something.

Based on these information, the following recursive formula can be used to find the total number of rooms where Hans might be checked in.\n\n`N(x) = (x + 1) * N(x - 1)`\n\nN(x), the number of rooms up to xth floor, recurses and grows by x + 1 for each recursion (x + 1 new rooms per recursion), and uses the total number of rooms of previous recursion level as its input. Since the first floor does not have the last floor room, every subsequent floor has 10 rooms, making N(1) = 10.\n\nFirst Iteration: The value of x = 0 and so N(0) = 10, as stated in the initial context.\n\nSecond Iteration: `N(1) = (1+1) * N(0) = (2)*10 = 20`\n\nThird Iteration: `N((1) = (1 + 1) *(2) = (2 + 1) = 3`\n\nSo the total number of rooms can be calculated using the formula above, giving a total of 99 rooms where Hans might be placed in at each floor level.

{"text": "Total number of positive cases: 2500\n\n### Rationales:\nFirst of all, we should be able to answer this question by following the mathematical steps below.\n1. **Step 1:** The total number of positive cases on the first day is 2000 + 500 = 2500. (We need to sum the number of positive cases that occurred on both the first day and the second day).\n2. **Step 2:** The total number 2500 of cases occurred on the first day (2000 +500). So the number of new positive cases on the second day (500) will be **divided** by 2500 which results to 2 (rounded).\n3. **Step 3:** On the third day, there are a total number of 2500 cases, (500) on the first case, (200) on the second case and (1500) on last case. So the total number of new positive cases will be 2 + 2 + 1500 = 1502\n\nThe total number of new positive tests will be (2500) - (1502) so is 98. We get 98 cases of new positive cases from the first day, the second day and the third day\n* So the total number of positive tests on that day is (2500).\n\nSo, the answer is 2500 as total positive cases as of date.\n \n \n \n\n### Reference:  \n[https://www.fcc.gov/general/federal-communications-commission-fcc](https://www.federalreserveeducation.org/education-services-federal-reserve-board-governors-federal-open-market/)", "answer": " 3750"}

Now we have 2 times the total length of the distance. \n\nThe route is 38 miles, and we know that the total mileage for the entire route is 76 miles, since 2(a+1/2) = 2*6 = 12. Now we know that 76 is the total length of 24/2=12 players. We can now find the length of the route by dividing by 12. We have 38 divided by 12 and the result is.38 which is 0.38\n\nI think the answer would equal 0.38 or 38/12\n\n### Input (9)(18)(18)(8)(7)  *  18 = 1104 \n\n### Demosration:\nInput:(6)(8)(4)(5)(6) = 901\n\nAnswer:", "answer": " 650"}

That is an interesting thing to know, wouldn't you think?  The frog's egg can only be laid once.

Since it has been laid on a second day of it'self'it is now on day number three of it's life.  If a frog's egg has not been laid on the most recent day, it would be reasonable to conclude that it must have been laid on at least one day.

{"text": "## Output:20\n\n### Explanation:\nInput:Tina is getting the money in order to sell the books.\n1. \"Getting\" means the money for sales is there in the first place.\n2. However, the sales are not real until they happen, hence the \"realizes\". To the rest of the sentence, \"realizes\" means that she has actually made sales, which is what the question is about.\n3. \"her sales\" refers specifically to the books she has sold instead of any other sales.\n4. \" $120\" could also say \"$121\" because \"20\" and \"1\" match but only \"120\" and \"20\" match.\n5. In this context, \"profit\" refers to the amount of money she gets, not the total money she invests.\n6. \"If she realizes a $0 profit on her sales\", would be true because in that case, she only pays for the two costs of the books sold. (This should not even be possible because of the prior part of the question, where Tina is guaranteed the costs and the number of people who bought.\n7. Hence, since the word after it is \"+profit, the question is asking if she makes profit, making the answer \"true\".\n\n### The profit is a $120 dollar profit, so she makes $120.\n\n### If she realizes a dollar profit on her sales, then the total value should not exceed $120. In addition, since she realizes a profit, she would have to make an investment.\n\n### Tina invests $20 (20 dollars for the books she is making) so the total amount (cost value) of her business should be $140.\n\n## Output:140\n\n### Together, that would have given Tina a total profit of $120: $120 minus the cost value of her business of $140. (Note that Tina may have sold only 1, and hence, still sold all of her books!)\n\n### Question:\n1.

A gallon meanwhile is a unit of volume with the abbreviation 'gal'. For the second statement, 2.8 is miles per gillion liter (MG) (this may not seem significant but it refers to volume and not weight, and is used to measure the volume of a liquid).

The first step is to apply the statement of 4/5 regarding income in a year, to each year's income.\n2. A simple rule is used: multiply each year's income by 4/5 to get the amount of money he makes in one year.\n3. So, for his income in his 10th year, the amount will be $300 * 4/5 = $240 = $26.73\n4. Since the given statement also states that \"he saves 40%\", the income has to be divided by 12, to get the amount of the money saved in a month.\n5. By the end, we can get the average monthly income by using the same rule (4/5) in a year.\n6. The amount is equal to $464.67, rounded to $464, where the decimal is the third digit.\n7.

Many of these creations are known to be useful and helpful instruments to humans. For instance, a robotic vacuum cleaner can clean our homes, and robots can also do complicated tasks in space that are too dangerous for humans.\n\nHowever, in the future, robots will be an important part of our community, but will they take over humanity? This will most likely not happen. A robot cannot perform and execute things as easily, and as efficiently, as humans can. Besides, robots are programmed mechanically, which means they will only carry out what a certain setback of orders can perform. If the program is not set correctly and the robot encounters an object it cannot pass, it can easily malfunction.\n\nI do not believe that humans will be replaced by the robots we create. Surely, science and technology have advanced and continue growing very fast, but as long as humans can, we will be the ones who will be the pioneers. However, I do believe we will use robots because it is easier and faster to execute a task than humanly doing it. I am quite sure though that many things that humans can perform will still be in the hands of humans. For example, we can still eat, use the bathroom, and even laugh.

We are asked to complete a simple sentence by providing a word to fill in a blank.\n2. We know that the nouns \"large\" and \"round\" are adjective describing the noun \"pumpkin\"\n3. In order to complete the sentence, we need to use a word that matches the noun \"large\" and \"Round\"\n4. The word \"plump\" does not fit. A plump pumpkin is one that is bulging.\n5. The noun \"plump\" does fit the description of a honeydew, so we do not have to add the word \"pumpkin\" if we want to say that a honeydew is plump.\n6.

{"text": "After his raise, Roberto's current salary amounts to $320,000.\n\n### Rationale\n\n1. The statement reveals the relationship between Roberto's starting salery and the 20% raise.\n2. First, we need to convert 20% to a decimal first.\n3. The starting salary is 3.1% of the total raise.\n4. The total raise is 3.7% of the starting salary.\n5. Because the relationship is indirect, the 20% was not given directly, but was found from the equation we formed from diving the starting salary and the total raise by the respective decimals.\n6. We can simplify the equation by changing the decimal to percentages.\n7. Then, we are able to see that the total raise is 37% of the starting sale, as indicated by the equation.\n8. Next, we look for 37% of $80,080.\n9. We find that the answer is $32,000. 37% is the answer.\n10. Finally, we convert it to a decimel, making the answer $320,800.\n11.

To find out the total number of days he worked, we need to count from the 3th starting from the 3rd day and going all the way through the 8th day, which is in effect 8 workdays.\n5. Then, we add 8 to 3, which equals to 11. Therefore, John worked 11 days.\n6. Now, John worked 8 hours a workday, which means he worked 84 hours in total. Hence, the answer is 84 hours.\n\n### Input\nThe teacher read the chapter on _____ and said that the chapter was very good.\n\n### Response\nThe chapter read by the teacher", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "The total number of balloons blown are 5 + 9, which adds up to 14.\n\n### Rationales:The given statement indicates that Kris and her brother want to blow as high a number of balloons as possible in 30 minutes.\n2. We can reasonably assume that if two individuals with different speeds can blow balloons at the same rate that the total sum of their products should be equal to that rate. In other words, the answer should be the speed at which they could have blown enough balloons.\n3. Knowing that, 15 min is the time taken by Kris alone and the rest 15 min will be done by her brother with a higher speed so the higher speed should be taken into consideration.\n4. There is no need to ask Kris for the number of minutes for which she is able to blow balloons at 2. Given that she can blow 2 balloons per minute then it is obvious that she is able to blow 4 balloons per minute.\n5. We know that Kris and her Brother blow 2 balloon in 2 minutes so total for Kris will be 26. Now 1 more minute is used by her brother and then it remains 5 minutes which can be covered by her brother and then the amount that remains left will be 9.\n6. Now the rest 15 minutes is done by brother and with a speed of 4 per minute so it will be 12 + 18 (he adds 4 extra balloons) so total number of balloon Kris and her brother will be able to blow will be 24 + 12 + 2 = 38\n7. But the actual answer is 5 + 9 which means 14.\n8. As we have assumed that brother is 2x as fast as Kris so 3/5th of the total value belongs to her.\n9. Hence the answer 5 + 9 = 14\n10.

The quantities can differ because of the differences in the number of ants per individual.\nBy the addition principle, a+b+c+d = k where a = 4, b = 1/2d, c = a+d and d = b+c+e. By solving the equation for d, we have d = (k-a-b)/2 = (e+c+b+a)/2 = (e-k+2c)/2. Substituting for k we have e = ((e-k+2k)/2-k)/2 = ((e-k-k)/2)/2 = e- (k+k)/2 = e-(0)/2 = e.

We need to explain why \"Alison gave Anna whole of the collection in exchange...\" is grammatically correct.\nIn fact, the second grammatical error is correct. \nRationale:\n1. A clause is a group of words that makes sense on its own or can be part of larger structure, e.g., a sentence. Causes an action and effects an action. \n2. \"The boss was fired. She had done a great job.\"\n3. \"She gave a bad performance today.\" = the effect \n4. \"It was a great day.

These can have a subject and predicate in the form of a verb and pronoun combination with a coordinating conjunction or simple sentence. E.g., \"She was angry.\" \n\n- A predicate noun clause or dependent clause is a clause that can not stand alone as an independent clause but cannot function as an independent clause in the same sentence. Dependent clauses come between the subject and the predicate in a sentence. Example of a dependent clause are \"Alison gave Ana/who/ her part of her collection\"... \n\n- A relative clause adds information about a noun in a sentence. \n\nIn the example above, the relative clause \"her part of her collection\" refers to Anna. The part of a collection of stamps that Anna exchanged for her book.\n\nThe next half sentence is a simple verb. \nIt is grammatically correct as well as the second half \"in exchange of\" \"half of the collection\".

In order to calculate the price of a cartoon egg, we can use the information that the total price of a car of 12 eggs if twice their individual price.\n2. This means that we can find the price of a cartload eg when we do the two equations.\n3. The individual price per egg is equal to the total price of 12 eggs divided by 12. Therefore, the individual price per egg is $0.12.\n4. Similarly, the total cost of 12 cartons equals 2\u00d7$0.12=24, so the individual cost of 12 eggs equals 12 divided by 24=1/2.\n5. Therefore, the price of a single carton of 10 eggs is 1/2 times the individual price per each egg when there are 12 eggs in the egg carton.\n6. Thus, the price of the egg car is 0.12/2 = 0.06.

The number of blue shirts can be found by using the information:\n\nMary has 36 brown shirt and gave away a third of them. Since Mary has two types of shirts, a third of 36 brown shirs are equivalent to a fifth of 32 blue shirs.\n\n 36/(32) = 4/5, then 4/5 of 32 = 13\n\n2. Since Mary has 36 brown and gives away a third (1/3) of them, she will be left with 36 - 1/3 = 35 brown shirts.\n3. Mary gave away half of her blue, it is the equivalent of a quarter (1/4) of the number of brown shirts. Since 1/4 of 35 brown shirt is equivalent to 1/2 of 13 blue shirts, she would be left with 13 - 1/2 blue shirts.\n4.

{"text": "In the given task, we can use the rule of grouping in order to simplify the question.\n1. We have the following equations:\na) Aivo = 5 months older than Therese.\nb) Jolyn = 2 months older than Leon.\nc) Leon = 2 months younger than Jolyn.\nd) Therese = 2 months younger\nthan Jolyn.\n\n\t2. By making Therese 2 months younger than Leon, and Leon 2 months younger than\n\tJolyn, we can see that the only variable that has not been made the same as all\n\tthe others is Jolyn, so therefore she must be twice as old as Therese.\n\n3. After substituting Jolyn for Leon in the equation Leon = 2 months older, we can\n\tobtain the following new equation:\n\t-\tLeon = 2 months older\n\t-\tLeo = 2months younger\n\t-\tJolyn = 5\n\n4. Then, Therese must be +2 months younger than both Leon and Jolyn, so:\n\t-\tTherese = +2 months older\n\t\t=> Therese = +2 months younger\n\t-\tAivo = +2 months older.\n\n5. By substituting the expressions for different people from the equation Leon = Aivo + 2\n\tmonths we obtain:\n\t-\tJolen = Leon +2 months = Aivo + 4 months = 8 months older,\n\t-Therese = Leon +2 months\n\t-\tAival = Therese + 2\n\n6.

Therefore, we have the equation:\n\t-Jolen = Leon + 8 months\n\t-Therse = Leon + 2 months\n\t-Aival = Leon + 8+months\n\n8. And Aivo = Leon + 6+ months = 8 + 6 +6 months old, or 19 months old.\nTherefore Jolyn is (2 - 19) months older.

{"text": "The answer is:   $12000\n\nRationale:  \nThe question asks us to find out the cost of everything ordered by John. We are given the quantity of food ordered and the price per pound as given by the order. As such, we can conclude that:\n\n1. The amount of chicken ordered is twice the amount of beef, as beef requires twice the charge per pound.\n2. Beef: The quantity of beef ordered is 1000 + beef ordered. The price per pound is $8. The final cost will be 1000 x $8 = $8000\n3. Chicken: The quantity of chicken ordered is 2 x beef ordered. The quantity of chicken is 2000 + chicken ordered. The price per piece is $3. Therefore, chicken ordered will be 2000 x 3 = $6000. Hence, the total cost will be $8000 + $6000 = $14000. Since 2 units of chicken costs $6000, John must have ordered 1000 units to make the total cost $1400. Hence, John should have ordered $1400 units of chicken to give a price of $1400 each. Thus, the final cost is $1200.\n\n\n### Input:(175) How much does it cost for each item in that set, each item from a restaurant, and $2 for a delivery charge and then 7% tax.

{"text": "I have 46 marbles.\n\n### Explanatory answer:\nTo solve this problem, we will:\n1. Let X be the initial amount of marbles, that is, X equals 25 initially.\n2. Consider the percentage decrease 20% for the subtraction.\n3. From the previous step, X - 0.2 X = 40 (40% of what remains).\n4. Multiply the percentage and the amount by two X to get double the amount again (2 X 40%).\n5. X + 2 (0.2 X) = 56 (we double the amount left after the percentage decrease then add on the 40).\n6. Therefore, X + 0.08 X = 56 (the initial amount after percentage decrease) + 40 (what was left)\n7. The equation becomes X + 0.8 X = 96, which simplifies down to 2 X = 192.\n8. Therefore X = 96.\n9.

{"text": "Answers: \n1. 1,900 oranges and 240 nectarines in total. \n2. 4,300 pieces of fruit in total.\n\n#### Rationale:\n1. Because we are given the total number of pieces in each of the entities, we cannot multiply these to the final answer as follows: 12 x 150 + 16 x 30 = 1,905 nectarines 12 x 50 + 15 x 40 = 1,200 oranges\n2. The reason for this answer is because the total number of pieces of fruit in the crates and boxes should equal to the sum of the total number of oranges and nectarines in the crates and box separately.\n3. As such, the total number of orangies and nectarines is 2 x 1550 = 3,100  and 2 x 260 = 520  which is the same as 5 times the total number of pieces, so the number of pieces is total number of oranges + total number of nectarines.\n4. Since we are given that 12 crates and 16 boxes, the total number of crates is 12 and the number of boxes is equal to 16.\n5. When we multiply 12 by 150 and 16 by 30 and then add the results, we get a total number of oranges of 1,902.\n6.

We know the number of minutes he is worked for on Monday, which is 451. Since the answer to the previous question is half the value it obtained from the previous question, half of it is 3:15.

This can be seen when we subtract from 21, x(x-1).

The question asks us to determine how many seconds it would take the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle if they were both traveling in the same direction.\n2. We can find the change in position of the cheetah by multiplying the rate of change in speed (change in distance per unit of time) of the cheetah (the change in mph divided by 1 mile per hour) by the rate of change in the distance of the cheetah at that speed.\n3. Thus, we can subtract the gazelle's rate of change in position from the cheetah's from this equation to find the change in position and hence the number of seconds the cheetah takes to close the gap.\n\nAnswer:\n\nRationalized:\n\n**Note:**\n\n1.[( 60 mph/1 mile/h) - ( 40 mph/1 miles/h)]/1.3 \n\n2. \n\n[((-210 ft)/(60mph * 1.3  ]\n\n  -    [((-210ft)/(40mph * 0.5] = 3.45s\n\n3. \n\nTherefore , The given problem asks for the time that it took for the cheetah to  catch up with the gazelle if they run in the same direction.

However, it is unclear if the proposition is true or false. It is therefore wise to present evidence with the opposing view as well.\n\nNext, the second task states that the student must \"existing information to provide support against the given thesis\", which means that the student needs to use logic, evidence, and reasoning to disprove the thesis. To achieve this, the writer should start by explaining the thesis and supporting it with evidence from the text.\n\nFinally, the last task states that the writer should \"provide evidence supporting evidence as well as information on how strong the proposition is considered and its implications.\" Based on this statement, the writer should provide additional evidence to support their position. And also try to show an overall impression of what is implied by this proposition. In addition, the implication will also be based on the strong position.\n\n### Input & Response (Part 2):\n\nIn this task, first, the writer begins by justifying the thesis. After justifying the thesis, he/she presents a weak argument against the thesis. Later, the argument against the thesis is supported with evidence and reasons.\n\nLastly, the writer concludes their argument by using a quote to summarize his/her argument.\n\n### Answer\n\n#### Answer & Rationale (Part 1): Since the student does not support the proposition, the answer is A.\n\n#### Answer & rationale (Part 2): \n\nThe writer's argument is weak because the thesis is not supported by any evidence. Therefore, the argument against", "answer": " 90"}

{"text": "Input:Trevor needs go downtown for date\n\nRationales:\n1. The given scenario describes Trevor as needing to go downtown.\n2. We know that he intends to take a taxi, the choice to take an Uber or a Lyft is implied by the choice of a taxi.\n3. We are given information that Uber costs $4 more than Lyft.\n4. Similarly, we are also given information that Uber and Lyft cost $3 more than a taxi.\n5. The choice of a Lyft and an Uber does not depend on the choice of another, because both can occur independently. In other words, since Lyft can be $4 more expensive than a taxi, it can be $3 more expensive when Uber is also $4 more expensive.\n6. The given question indicates that Uber costs $22. However, the context does not indicate whether we are only interested in Trevor's ride or also his tips for the taxi driver.\n7. If we need to focus on the cost of the ride, the answer is $22.\n8. Otherwise, it can also be $25.\n\n### Input 2:Lucas's taxi is waiting at the curb. Lucas and Toby, his sister, have $45 to pay for the ride. Toby gives Lucas $8.\n\n### Rationales 2\n1. The scenario describes Lucas's taxi, Lucas and Toby, and the cost of the ride to go downtown, which is $45.\n2. We are only required to use the two dollars given by Toby.\n3. This means we need to determine an algorithm that ensures Lucas and Toby pay $45 without exceeding the $45 at any point.\n4. Toby giving Lucas $8 could be considered a choice.\n5. The $8 could be used in several ways by Lucas & Toby to make up for the $45 of the ride, but we are only required to consider and use the $8.\n6. The $45 could be split into several amounts.\n7. One possible split could be $32.5 to be used by Lucas and $12.5 to be kept by Toby.\n8. Another split could be $40 to", "answer": " 18"}

Hence, his collection is 1/4 of the total seashells initially collected by Henry and John. This means that Leo collects a total of 14 seashells.\n\nWe also know that Henry collects 11 after giving up a quarter from his collection. Hence, he collects a total of (11- 1/4)= 10.5 seashells.\nIn the first line of the question, we can see that Henry, John, Leo, and Paul collect a total of 59 seashell initially.\n\nWe can thus write a formula that represents our known information as follows (in which n= number of seashells that Henry initially collects):\n\n\\newline\n(n + 4) - \\dfrac{n}{4}\n\nThe above formula is a mathematical formula that gives the total number of seasheells Henry, John, Leo and Paul collect if n= number of seasheels that Henry collects initially.\n\nAfter calculating the number of seashells, Henry, John, Leo collects, we can solve the question and answer it easily:\n\nTotal Seashells Henry, John and Leo collect: (59 - 4) + \\dfrac{1/4}{4}= 58\n\nWe can thus solve the question based on the given information and formulas.\n\n#### Note: To calculate the total number of seastells, we can use the formula (n+1) - \\dfrac{1}{4}\n\n### Input : Solve the math problem and write it down :\n11 + 5x - 11 \n\n### Response :\n\nBased on the given problem, we can solve it as follows:\n\n11 + 6x - 11 => 7x - 11\n\nSubtract 11 from both", "answer": " 53"}

{"text": "```\nThe total mass of fruit harvest in this orchard is :\nApple mass :  150 x 30 = 4500\nPeach mass :  65 x 45 = 2875\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe quantity of fruit yielded by each tree is represented by each variable and is determined by the given equation. Because there are 30 apple trees and 45 peaches, the total sum of the fruit yielded is 4500 kg and 2875 kg, respectively. This represents the total fruit mass.\n\nThe quantity of fruit per tree is 150 kg, and 65 kg, respectively. The quantity of trees has a factorial effect and increases the total quantity of fruit due to the multiplication. To demonstrate multiplication with variables, we have used nested quantifiers and set quantifiers for the apple mass because we are dealing with a quantity. Moreover, we have also used set quantifiers because we are dealing with the number of trees which represent the mass. Hence, as shown below :\n\n$$Apple mass : \\qquad \\text{quantifier} \\qquad \\text{mass} $$\n\n$$Peach mass :\\qquad \\text{quanti} \\qquad \\text{\\color{red}{er} mass}$$\n\nThe use of quantifiers determines the number of mass of apples and peaches each of the 38 trees give. We can then divide the total mass (450 kg + 2875kg) by to find the actual quantity of fruit for each fruit. Apple is 450/38 and peaches is 2875/38 to get the quantity of each. To explain it mathematically, we may assume the total number of fruit to be greater than the total number of trees. However, this is not required.\n\n<p style='text-align:left'>\nThis may be used in the same manner to multiply any number of quantities if the quantity is not greater than the total number.\n</p>\n\n\n### Response Explanation:\n<p style='box-sizing: border-box; padding-bottom: 20px; color: #93419; border-radius: 5px; background-color: #ebe1a5; margin-bottom:", "answer": " 7425"}

Hence, the total cost would be $75$ dollars in 6 weeks.\nHence, the sentence is C: $75$ dollars.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Mark's cost would be determined by the time he chooses to stay in the theater. Therefore, to find out the price paid for each hour, we substitute the hours spent by Mark in the 6-week period. Since Mark's ticket costs $5 for each hour, he would end up paying $5(5x 3) = $75. If Mark sat in the theater for 3 hours, it would cost him $5(3x3) = $30.\n2. To find mark's total cost, we must substitute $5x$3 and $75$. Hence, the total cost is $75$.

{"text": "Answer: D: $.30 per brick\n\n### Demand: The math question reads \"To make a shed in....... bricks Tom needs..........\"\n### Solution 1:\nOne way to decipher the problem is to start with the 1000 and divide it in half to get 500.\nTo get.5 of 1000 is 500. Then, after dividing the total remaining (500) into two, (250), 500 must be divided again to get 100, 250 must be divided again into 125, 125 must be divided again to give 100, and the remaining 25 must be given 2 bricks to reach 500. This means that for each 100 bricks it costs $.5.\n\n### Solution 2:\nWe take the cost of the cheapest bricks, the full price price, and make that the denominator in the fraction (i.e. 1/2). Then, for each fraction we take the whole number, multiply it by the denominator, and subtract 1. Each of the half bricks costs twice as much. In the denominator, the fraction is reduced because we multiply by 1/2 which is already a fraction. When the denominator becomes greater than 1, we simply find the common denominator that is highest. In the final answer, the price would be rounded because of the lack of a decimal place.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Dividing the whole number 1000 by 100 yields: 10.\n\n2. The first step is to divide by 10, then divide by 10 again, but each time, the value is less than 1.\n\n3. The last fraction we divide by is 5.\n\n4. Once the denominator is 5, we cannot do any more long division, instead, we find a common denominator and put 1000 as that denominator.\n\n5. We multiply 5 by its decimal to get 0.5, and then we take the cost of half a brick and subtract 1 from the total cost, giving us the total value of 0.5 \u00d7 1000 = 5", "answer": " 375"}

We are given two statements (I and III), but these are insufficient for us to determine what Yola's current weight is. Therefore the question cannot be answered using the given information.\n2. In order to answer the question, you have to know Yola's current and past weights. In such a situation, your inference can find out what Yola's past weight is given what her current and the older statement say.\n3. You can find out what Yolawas weight 2 years ago by setting it up as follows:\nYola weighs 380 pounds = x years later = 400 pounds = 30 pounds + 80 pounds = Wanda's current weight\nNow simply apply algebra,\n(2X) + 400 = 400\n(2) + 380 = 380\n2 = 54 < (60) + 382<76\nHence her past weight must've been 60 pounds.

After that, how many chickels does Wendi have? \n\n### Demos:\nWe are given 32 less than 63 chickens initially. Then, a neighbor' dog ate 1 of the less than 69 chicken. So, 32 less than the number of chickels we had initially is now reduced to 31. \nNext, we are given more chickens. When we say there are 31 chickens, this doesn't mean there are exactly 31 chickels, it means that there are at least 31 chickles and up to 63 chickels. So, if you include the 31 chickel we already had, the next 5 chickels are less than 43 in addition and finally there is 1 less than 7 additional chicken.\nTherefore, there are 35 less than 63, that is, 28 less than 63.\nAnother way of arriving the answer is to divide the number of extra chickels  by 2 to get 19, add this number to 31, then subtract 4 from the sum of these numbers to obtain the answer of 28 less than the original number of chickels.", "answer": " 13"}

You should calculate 60 coals per 60 minutes or 60 coals every minute so that you would have enough time for every bag of coals that were left over 230 minutes for three bags, one bag per 230 minutes is a better answer. But how long did the grill actually run?

Answer:  D: 330 minutes\n2. Reason: When grilling is over, there are ashes left over and they need to be counted as burned coal also (60 x 230 minutes = 400 coals).

We need the variable: Page Number (page\\_num) = page number x 1.\n* 1) Page_Num is the initial value for the first page.\n* 2) For subsequent pages, We can subtract 7 and multiply it to get the page number, after each loop\n* 3) Then we can subtract 3 which is the blur and crumple page number to get the original page number.\n4. Then, we can apply `while` condition to check whether the condition is false or true, and output the number of pages which aren't crumpled and blurred.\n5. The solution is as follows:\n\n```python\n#Code\nPage_number=0\nPage_num=0\nnum=0\ntotal=0\nwhile Page_num <= 42:\n    total=41-Page_num   \n    if total%7==0:\n        print(Page_num)\n        total=total+7\n\n    if total%3==0:\n        num=num+1\n\nprint(num) #The last page's num\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\npython test.py\n42\n```\n\nRationales:\n\n1.

{"text": "Rick had a total of 130 cards, of which he decided to keep only 15 cards for himself and give his friends 12 each and then dividing the remaining cards equally to his two sisters. So, since Rick decided to keep only 3 cards, he must have given those 3 cards to one of his sisters. Hence, he has 3 cards more in the remaining 123 cards. Thus, Rick had 3 cards for himself, 123 cards for his sisters that he gave equally and he gave 12 cards to his friends. So, Rick has shared exactly 130-3+123+12 cards. Hence, 52 cards remained for Rick, which he divided equally among his 2 sisters, leaving him with 26 cards. If one of Rick's 2 sisters got 3 of Rick's cards, then 26 cards were left over for the other sister, which means that she got either 23 or 29 cards, depending on whether Rick divided the 26 cards equally or not. So, either 2 sisters got each 23 cards, or they got each 29 cards. Because the question specifically asks, \"how many cards did Rick give Mikel\" which means he is referring to the distribution of cards after the decision to share, not after the initial decision to reduce the total number of cards, it is clear that either 2 sisters each got 23 cards, from which Rick decided to give his friend 12 from each of them.\n\nAnswer: Rick had a total of 66 cards - 15 cards for each of himself and his two sisters, which he divided equally amongst them. He gave Miguel 12 cards, then he divided the remaining 53 cards between his two sisters. One sister received 26; so the other one received 27. Rick's sisters were each given a total of 50 cards. Each of them was given 25, and then the remainder was divided equally between the two. \nEach sister received 25 cards, so she gave 12 to someone else (Miguel) and still had 13. This means that, when Rick decided to give someone else the rest of his cards, the total he had left was 30. Rick gave each of his two sisters", "answer": " 13"}
{"text": "The first thing we need to do is convert the words to whole numbers so that we can begin solving the problem mathematically. Ittymangnarks catch should be represented by the whole number 12, because he catches 1 fish every 24 hours. Kingnooks catch should be represented by 11 because she catches 1 fish for every 22 hours she goes out to fish. Oomyapecks total catch is represented by 4 because each of the fish he catches is an eye; and there are 4 eyeballs in each fish.  Thus, adding up the fish in the food supply we have 27 whole fish. The second thing we need to do, is find out how many fish each person is giving away to other people, in Oomyapecks case, we subtract 22 from 27 to get 5. So each person gives away 3 fish. The third thing we need to do find out how many fish are left for each person.  So, after the people give away 3 fish each, the person with the greatest food left behind has 4 fish left in the food supply. The next step we should do is divide up the four fish between Ittymangnars and his and her child by half, for a total of 8. Kingnooks has no fish left, so she has nothing to give to Ittymangnaks, and that is why his fish is greater. Finally the last step we should take is divide the fish among Ittymangnak, his child, and his dog. Because Ittymangnams is the one who catches the fish, he gets half of the total catch, which comes to 2 fish. Ittymangnnaks daughter gets 2 fish and his dog is left with 1 fish to eat each day.\n\n### Input : The population of a community has doubled in the last 100 years.

No\" because anything greater than 38 but not greater than 52 is 51 and greater than 52. 39 is neither of these.\n \nRationales:\n1. The question asks for numbers between two given numbers, so we would have to use a number between that range.\n2. The given numbers are given in the instruction (\"38 and 52\"); therefore, the number has to be smaller than 52 but larger than 38, not both.\n3. For example, 40 is more than 39 but less than 41.\n\nAnswer: The answer can only be a non-negative integer between 38 and 51 (including both).\n\nAn example is 39, 40, 40,..., 49 (all integers).\nThere is no integer between 38-52.", "answer": " 9"}

Therefore, we have something like Last year - \"is\" the age of his sister - \"equals\" times the age of Darcy. - \"equals\" times 2 * the age.\nDallas is [his]sister Now, this statement can be replaced with [Dallas is (the age of his sister)].\n\nHence, the last statement can be replaced with Dallas's age.\n\nWe obtain \"his sister's age = 2 * 2 = 4\".\n\nFurther substitution with the previous statement will result in the age of Dallas's sister.\nHence, Dallas is 48 years old now.\n\n### Output:Last year Dallas was twice the age of his sister who is twice as old Dexter who is eight years old.

In particular, the quantities are 4, 5 and 9.\n2. Based on (1), we calculate 22, which means the total number of cookies to make a sale of 50 units is 22.\n3. Knowing that the quantity of each item is in the number of units sold, Jack needs to multiply each quantity by the total number of units sold to obtain the cost of each item by itself.\n4. Note that the item on the far right is a whole sale of $50 and must be eliminated from the calculation above.\n5. We then compare the units sold to the number of cookies sold, and we conclude that each cookie should be sold for $4.\n\n### Input\n\n    You are given an array of numbers, and an index value, for which you want to return the element at that position in the array. If the index value equals or exceeds the length of the array, return -1.\n\n### Response\n\n    function find(array, index, callback) {\n      if(callback) {\n        var value = false;\n      }\n      for(var i = 0, length = array.length; i < length; i++) {\n        if(callback && callback(array[i], i)) {\n          value = array[i];\n        } else {\n          return array[i];\n          break;\n        }\n      }\n      return value;\n    }\n\n### Rationale\n\n1. In a loop, check whether the index value is equal to or less than the length of an array. If it is less than, use the callback to compare the value with the element in that position in the array, and return it at that loop statement. Otherwise, return -1 outside the loop.\n2. Using the callback as the condition is an alternative, but both options return -1 given the array length is exceeded during a for-loop iteration.\n3. The only difference is the initial state and how to return -1 when an array element cannot be returned.\n\n### Solution\n\n```javascript\n        function find(array, idx, callback) {\n          if (!callback)\n              throw new TypeError", "answer": " 7"}

What must they do instead?\n\n### Demand:\nFor this situation, Amy and Max put only $5 into their piggy bank and each have $5 left. However, they are able to purchase a kitten for $10. That means they need more money or less. For example, let's take Amy: She has $5 remaining; 5/15 is her money left. She has a $5 bank for her kitten so $5/15 - $5 or $5 of remaining money would be enough to pay the price and get the rest in kitten. That is why she needs $5.\nMax has $5 as well.

According to the context, the production cost is $60 million\n2. For our calculation, we can write \"$60 million\" any time we substitute \"cost\".\n3. The question specifies that a 60% profit margin is retained by the production company, so they were able to make $60 million of the total revenue.\n4. Therefore, we can write \"$360 million - $6 million = $354 million\", where you can recognize \"$360 million\" as \"$420 million - 60% of $420 million\".\n5. The profit comes from subtracting $360 million from the $420 million.\n6. We multiply the result by 3.5 in order to calculate the profit.\n7. We multiply by 3.5 because it should be 3.5 times higher than the amount of the production costs.\n8. To convert \"60%\" to a fraction, use common fraction notation and write the value for 3.5, which is 3 3/5 fraction.\n9.

During the same _________ (week), it rained 2 ________ (mm) at his house. How ________________ (much) less rain did Greg experience ___________________ (while) camping?\n\nRationales:\n1. Use of underline for the word \"Camping\" to emphasize the word is necessary, because the context of \"Camping\" is being used in the sentence, and it's use of a proper grammar is vital.\n2. Use of the word \"with\" in the phrase \"camping with\" is proper, it implies Greg's family are also camping.\n3. Use of parentheses to describe the numbers in the answer is necessary, because the amount of rain on the 3 days are not direct words, however the amount of rain in the answer is directly stated.\n4. We used commas to separate the days, because in the context of time we used \"Three days\".\n5. When separating the words for the question it is necessary to use periods (.), not commas (,), because there are no commas in the question.\n6.

It can be: Choices: A: to be qualified for the work B: to be ready for something C: to succeed D: to complete the task E: to be qualified for a job F: to accomplish a work G: to succeed.\nRationales:\n1. We already know it's an adjective which means it's modifying a verb or a noun and not the complete sentence. For instance we would never say this: \"The students ___________ their goals. \"\n2. It must be one of the options given because it's \"accomplished\" and not \"task accomplished\" or \"goal accomplished\".\n3. \"Qualified for work\" means that someone is prepared to do the job.\n4. \"Qualified for a position\" is someone who is qualified to hold the position or to do the job.  To do the job you must also be qualified for the position. In short, a qualified person will have all the necessary skills and experience to do the job. A qualified person can also work in the field of his interest as long as it fits with his capabilities.\n5. \"Success\" means to accomplish a job.\n6. The answer must be either E or F.\n7. Therefore \"accomplish\" could mean either \u201cto succeed\u201d or \u201cto complete the task\u201d and we need your help to decide.\n8. \n9.

Even if all of the other screws are tight, the behavior of the machine will not change in any way.\n### Input 2: If screw B was tightened how would that effect the machines behavior?\n### Response2: If screw \"B\" is tightened, then the screw \"A\" will be loose.

{"text": "Answer: C: 90\n\n### Demystification:\nInput: We can assume that the number of minutes Mack writes in each session on each day directly corresponds to the number of pages he gets to write in his journal.\n\nRationales:\n1. Because there is no mention of time outside of weekdays, we can assume that the days are Monday to Wednesday.\n2. We can tell this because weekdays are often referenced as a singular unit, \"Monday through Wednesday\" (though we don't have that information here, so we assume it).\n3. If we assume there are only three days mentioned, we will get answers that we will know are wrong.\n4. Because we know that the sessions don't overlap, it means that Mack can only write 60 pages on Monday (1 page every 3 minutes) and 45 pages on Tuesday (1 page every 1 minute). This is because 50 pages have already been written in the session on Tuesday.\n5. If we combine the information on Saturday and Sunday, we can know that the whole time he was writing, Mack was writing at an overall rate of 1 pages every 15 minutes, so 60 minutes gets him 60 pages, and not 1.\n6. This also means that there is no intersection between the time spent writing on Tuesday and the time spent writing on Wednesday.\n7.

We also have a statement that there are 7 people having the whole pile.\n\n3. Multiply 7 to the x will be 49 (this is what we call the whole number).

{"text": "It should be sold for $3450. This can be calculated through the equation: 15% of a number = number multiplied by x. This means to get the profit, we need to divide the 3000 by  100 to get 30 and multiply this by the number x. So 30(X) = 3000(100/15), this can be simplified to 30X = 300-15, then 30X =  285, then 10X = 285/30, or 10X =  95/3, and then X = 95/3. Substitute this in the original equation, which will get 3450.\n\n### Rationales:\nLuxury bag costs $3,000.\nA reseller wants to get 15%.\nTherefore, we add 100 for the price as we are dividing our profit by 15: So 3,000(15/100) = x.\nWe then simplify to: 30(X)=  3000(6.66%/15), which is equal to 30X=426.66.\nThen we divide 30X by 5 and this gives 6: So 30X= 3000- 15 = 285-15=285/4 =  95/2 =95/3.\nSubstitute this in: 30X=  3000-15= 285.\nThen we divide this by 30 to get the final answer: 10X= 285, which is 94/3.\n\n### Answer:  A: $3450\n\n### Input2:\n1.5 x 2x 3 x 4 = 24\n\n### Input3:\n3 + 5  == 8\n\n### Output:\nInput 2 = 1.5 x 1.5 (1 times 15/2) = 7.5\nInput 3 = (3+5) * 2 = 1", "answer": " 3450"}

{"text": "John received a total of 28 gifts between his 12th and 13th birthdays.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. This statement requires you to find the sum of the two amounts.\n2. The two amounts are 20 and 8.\n3. So, to find the sum we find the difference between the two numbers and do the opposite operation, meaning add 12 to 8.\n\n4. Subtracting 8 from 20 gives us 22, and adding 12 to 22 gives us 34.\n5. The given data points to birthdays, so the numbers given represent how many gifts John received on each birthday, rather than an entire calendar year.\n6. Since he received 8 fewer gifs on his 13 birthday, subtracting this number from 20 gives the amount of gifts he received on his 12 birthday, 12.\n7. Therefore, the answer is 12 since that is the amount he received on his 20th birthday.\n8. This is because 22 minus 8 is 14, and 20 minus 14 is 6, so \"20 minus 8 is 22 minus 14\" is the same as \"12 minus 8\".\n\nAnswer: 12 is the answer.", "answer": " 32"}

Therefore, the number of people that play football out of 250 is 16\nIf the number of people that like football was 32, then the fraction of people that like football and play football would be:\n50/32 = 1.56 and 1.56 * 250 = 214. In this case, the number of people which play football out of 40 and 250 individuals is 214.\n\nAnswer: (A) 20\n\n### Context:\nExplanation: This answer choice is not correct since the sentence only said that 24 out of 60 people like it. It doesn't say how many like it. The person's choice in the answer is simply 20 which is the total of the 250 individuals and the 24 out of the 60 which liked football.

{"text": "Sarah has to eat 0.75 cups of vegetables each day to reach the weekly total of 2 cups.\n\n### Rationales:\nRationale: To satisfy the federal guidelines, she must meet the recommended amount: 2 cups. Sarah has already eaten 8 cupts, so we subtract 8 from 2. This gives us 2, which she needs to complete each day. We want the answer to be in the form of a decimal, so we need to know how many days there are left. We have 5 days, which is 0.5 in decimal (1/2). As Sarah has already eaten her entire daily quota for 2 of the 5 days, we multiply (0.5) (0.75) to get 0.375. To solve this, we need to add 0.37. This tells us that Sarah needs to eat 0.37 cupts of vegetable for the remaining 4 days. Therefore, we need to subtract our answer from the required amount, which is 0,025. Sarah needs to eat 2.3 of vegetables per day to meet her target.\n\nRationale: This answer is correct because if a person consumes 2 cups of veg/day for 5 days, then it is sufficient. However, the maths does not have more than 2 cups to complete in a period of 5 days. To get this answer to 2,4 we need to include 0.4 = 4/10 and 4 /10 = 40/1000 and this answer is incorrect because, to complete 0.4 cups we need to get 2 cups of the rest as well. Because, in this case, if we use the 0.4  cups, then 2-0.4 = 1.6 cups and again we will get the same results.

{"text": "Total trees earned per each type of apple = $$50 x 25\\%$$. Since, the sour apples are 25% of 75% of all the apple, the total apple trees he can sell are $$25 x.25 =.625$$. Therefore, 3/4ths of the apple will sell, and the remaining 1/4th won't, so he needs 6 divided by fourth of the number. There are 50 sweet apples, so there would be $$50 x.75 = 37.5$$.

{"text": "Input:Brendan can cough 8 yards of grass pee day, he bought a landmower and it helped ham him to cut more yards to fifty percent pee day. How many yards wendy be able to cut after week?\nDominion: If we know that \"Brendan can cut eight yards of grass per day,\" it would also be known that after cutting eight yards of grass in a day, \"He bought a land-mower and it helped hame him to cut more yards.\" By doing so, we can understand that once a person owns a mower, the person will be able to cut more grass because the mower is of great aid. Also, we could see that this mower has cut 30 percent of the grass he could have easily cut in eight days, and, he still has another 5 days to cut the rest of the grass he needs to cut. Hence, he may be able to cut roughly, 240 yards of grass in a week or so.\n\nAnswer: After a week Brendan will probably be able to cut roughly 240 yards, since he has 30 percent cut already, he still needs around 480 yards of grass to be done.

These 7 include taking a shower, making dinner, and cleaning the house at some point during the course of the day. We know this because the 'take a show' and 'clean the house' item are repeated under 'clean the house'.\n### Another way to look at this is to figure out how many things Trey has to do in order to clean the house. We know that Trey has 7 items under 'clean the hose', and we know that these 7 items include taking a shower. This is because the 'take a bath' and the 'clean the house item are in the same list, which implies that they must be related.\n### We also know that Trey must clean the house, which includes cleaning the house itself, as well as the things that are outside of the house, like the bathroom, kitchen sink, bathtub, etc.\n### So we know that Trey has to prepare food, take a bath and shower, and clean the house. In order to do this, Trey must do 3 things. We know that 2 of these things are related to bathing, which are preparing food and bathing. This leave us with an interesting question: How many items does Trey need to do to clean the whole house?\n### The answer is 4, which is half of 7, which is equal to 4.

{"text": "Answer: 26\n\n### Reasoning: The given statements show us his run times for 4 days of the week.\n1. On Monday, he runs for 50 minutes\n2. On Tuesday he runs for 60 minutes.\n3. On Wednesday he runs for 75 minutes\n4. On Thursday he does 80 minutes of running.\n\nNext, we are asked for what day he was able to run for 10 more minutes.\nLet's mark up the table using our observations to show the possibilities:\n| Monday | Tuesday | Weekday 1 | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |\n| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | ---:\n| 50 | 60 | | | | 75 | 80 | 80 |\n| --- | 75 | | | |\n### The only available time that meets the 20 minute cut short is Thursday. By running 10 more minutes on Friday, he can make up for the extra 10 minutes of running he didn't do on Thursday.\n\n### Thus, out of 4 days of the required 6 days, there are 3 full days and 1 partial day that equates to 55 minutes. If we multiply the 55 minutes by 60 seconds that means there's 3250 minutes in 5 days.\n### There's still the 5th day to account for where he cut short his run last Thursday.\n### Therefore, Thursday cut short the run for 20 minutes and on Friday he runs for 10 more. \n### 30 minutes of running in total. So the final question is how many minutes is he able to run and choose your answer as 55 + 30 which is 85 minutes then 85 multiplied by 60 is equal to 5100 minutes so 6\u00d75100 =6700minutes\n\n### Summary of the calculation:\nThursday he runs for 80 minutes and runs for 30 minutes for Friday which equals 110 minutes of running. So the sum of the run times is 110+ 6700 =", "answer": " 290"}

{"text": "The correct response for this question is 12 miles.\n\n### Justification:\n\nIt is important to understand that the question focus on the number of miles as it relates to the activity and how long or how little Paul runs on the treadmill while he watches movies. The questions starts off with the statement: While Paul watches movies...which suggests that watching movies is a task and activity that Paul is doing and not just the action of \"watching\". The use of \"which\" establishes that the action of watching two movies is a condition of the statement \"watches movies\" and we are to determine how this condition affects the activity while watching movies and not simply how much Paul watches. In the question, the only relevant factor to determining the miles ran while watching movies is the length of the movies and not how much he watches. For instance, if the movies were a combined total of 1.5 hr, then Paul could watch the movies and still run \"0 miles\" because the length of the moviess is equal to the time of duration he runs on his tredmill.\n\nThe statement: he can run a mile in (12) minutes provides us the amount of time it takes Paul to run a mile. It does not matter how fast or slow he runs a mile. This fact is true because it does not matter when Paul runs the mile. He could start at the beginning of the movie and finish when the movie ends, and he would still run 12 minutes.\n\nTo determine the distance, we must determine how much time is left to run a mile when Paul runs 12 minutes while watching two movies and we can determine this by analyzing how much time Paul watches. The given statement: And he watches two movies which are an average length is 1.5 hours, establishes that we need to determine how often Paul watch each movie and how long is each movie.\n\nTo determine how often Paul watches each movie, we need to compare the amount of time it take Paul to watch movies with the time he runs. We will begin with the second movie because the total duration of his activity must be equal to the time spent watching movies. The total duration is equal to the sum of the duration it takes to watch each movie. \nTo find out how long each movie lasts, we look at the statement:", "answer": " 15"}

The question is of the form \"How old is...\", where the blank implies the age of someone.\n3. The given statement, as input, requires us to describe how old Djibo's younger sister is today, so the age is represented in years.\n4. Therefore, we can identify the variable, Djibo's age in years, among the choices, and calculate it by adding his age with his sisters age 5 years ago.\n5. To calculate, we simply subtract from his age today by his age 5 years ago to get his sister's age. The result, in this case, was 35.\n6.

Assuming this was true for all the batches, there were 600/400 = 6/4 = 3/2 times more files that were useful.\n\nFinally, it asks for the remaining number of files that was left. If he started with 800 and deleted 70% in the first batch, then 400/600 = 3/4 was left in the first batch. If he had 1/4 as many files left after the first round, 600 is left with in the second batch.

Rationales:  A) Capitalizing \"homework\" is incorrect because a homework is not a proper noun.  B) We are supposed to replace \"homework\" with a homonym that is not a proper nown.  C) \"The dog ate her Math Homework\" is already a correct sentence; we should choose a different homonym.\n\n### The response would have to be a noun, not a verb.\n\n### You may choose the same word more than one time because you must choose a homonym.\n#### Answer:\nHomonym: homeowner\nAnswer: A person who owns a house or apartment\n\n### InputIf someone asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, I would tell them that I want to be a dentist.\n\n### Rationale: The word that works best here is a verb in the first person present indicative tense. We can infer that the person who is speaking does not currently have the job they want but wants it in the future. Since the speaker wants the job in the future, the verb we need is a future tense verb.  The words \"wanted to be\" can be rearranged to get a form of the verb \"am\", which is a present form of the verb be. Thus, the present tense", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "The answer is 713. Input:There are some Jelly beans in a jar, and three fourths of the Jelly beans are red and one quarter of the Red Jelly beans are coconuts flavored, if 750 jellies beans are coconout flavored, how many Jelly beans are there in a jar.\n\n### Method:\n1. Let t denote the total number of jelly beans in the jar.\n2. The first line of input gives the information about t.\n3. t is a power of 2, hence we have integer division problem.\n4. Number of red jelly beans(3/4) = red jelly beans/(t-t/4) = red beans/((t-1)/4) = red beins/(t-1)/4.\n5. Number of jelly beans are blue and coconut flavored (1/4) = number of red jelly bears/(2t-t-1) = red jelly/((2t-t)/4) = blue jelly/((2-1/4)((2t-1)/4).\n6. The number of blue and coconut jelly beans is a multiple of 3, therefore we can have 9 blue and coconut beans.\n  7. For every blue and coconut bean, we have 2 red beans.\n8. We can multiply 750 by 2 to get the total number of jellies, which is 1550 total.\n9. 750 is multiple of 3, so the answer to the question is 1598.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. We use the given constraints to find an efficient method to solve the problem.\n1. The method follows a binary tree (if we subtract from t, we can calculate the other variables).\n  1. This method efficiently solves the problem as the number of jelly bears that are not coconut flavored is the base case.\n  1. We find out the coconut beans since the number of red beans and number of blue beans are both multiple of 3.\n  2. The final result is 1559. \n\n### RATIONALE SOLUTION:\n1", "answer": " 4000"}

Time spent driving downhill is b. \nTime spent driving uphill is c.\nTotal time = 1/3 (a + b + c).\n\n(1/3(a + b + c)) = (3a + b-2c)=3a(1+1/3)+b(1/3)-2c(1/3)=3a-2c\n\nWe can simplify (b-2c) to -c by simply subtracting 2c from b.\n\n(a = b)=a-b = c\na = 1/3c\n\nNow we move on to the speed part.\n\nOn flat sand and on downhill slop, Conner drives at a speed of 50 mph.\nOn uphill slop, he drives at a speed of -18 mph.\nFrom the first two statements, we know a and b.\n\nc, however, is now unknown.

{"text": "Colton had 64 stickers left.\n\n### Rationale: 1. The first step in solving this problem is to define the variables used in the problem. \n2. The given numbers total to 72. The variable we use to represent the number of stickers is M.\n3. We then find out the number of stickers each of his friends get. Each of his 3 friends receive 4 dolphin stickers, and Mandy gets 2 more than what his 3 friends receive which is 2 extra dolphin stickers for a total of 6 , and Justin gets 10 less than what his 3 friend receive. Therefore, we get the formula: M = 3 X 4 + {2} + { 2} + {10} - {10} - 3 X 2 - 12\n4. So we simplify the formula by multiplying the terms within curly brackets and putting the value of 2 for the term by itself. Then the simplified formula would become:\n\nM = 3 X 20 -3 X 3 - 12\n\n5. After we simplify the equation, we get: M = 30. Therefore, the number of stickers he has left is M = 30\n\n### Input A: Alicia scored 60% and then she lost 5% on her spelling exam. How much did she score overall? Rationale: A:\n\n### Answer: Her total raw score is 55%. \nA: 60% plus 5% minus 5% is 60%. \n50% is the point at which there are bonus points. \nTherefore, if Alicia had scored 60% or more, she would've received bonus points. \nThat's why her overall score is 60%.\n\n### Input B: Alicia scored a 79 on her multiplication tests. She had an overall grade of 92. Was she getting As in class? Rationale:\n\n### No, A: There is a possibility that she was given partial credit for some of the assignments, however the raw score she earned for the tests is more than the overall grade.\n\n### There are two cases for this problem: 1. Alicia obtained a lower grade", "answer": " 42"}

Basil needs 6 boxes to last for a week.  Given 45 cookies per 1 box and 6 boxes last her a week, she will eat a total of 270 cookies in a week since 45 * 6 is equal to 270.  We can find the number of days to get Basil's total amount of cookies by dividing 270 by 3.  Therefore, Basil will eat a total of  90 cookies in 3 days.\n\nWe want to solve for N (number of boxes needed to last 30 days).

Choices: A: splitting C: multiply D: dividing E: splitting into 2 E: splitting into 4 E: splitting into 8 E: splitting into 16 F: splitting into 32 G: splitting into 64 G: splitting into 128\nRationales: The answer is Choice F: splitting into 4 times because it takes 128 days for the amoebae to split into 16 amoe beae. An amoect reproduces every 2 days. So it takes 56 days before the amoect can reproduce by fission. 56/4=14 So it takes 14 days for an amoect to produce 8 amoects. 8 amoect is only twice 4 hence it take 2x8=16 amoects=16 to produce 16 amoect.\nAnswer: F: splitting into 14 times", "answer": " 8"}

Choices: A: The student B: It C: was D: This E: He\nRationales: None\n\n### Demo:\n1. \"It just seemed like they\" is the context of the sentence that is being described by the phrase \"they didn't care about,\" which in turn is followed by a phrase which explains what \"they\" are doing.\n2. The context is used to identify the pronoun they, which is a group of people.\n3. The phrase \"it just seemed like they didn\u00b4t care about\" is the first mention of \"they,\" so it indicates that they is the person whose actions are being described.\n4. Since the phrase that describes an action involves \"seemed,\" it must be a verb phrase.\n5. Since we are dealing with a description of a group of people who \"didn't care,\" the action must be the group's action.\n\n6. Therefore, \"they didn't\" care in the phrase \"it just seemed\" to be about students' educational problems. \n\n\n### Input\"Humanity\u00b4s destiny has been to suffer, and to endure, overcome and ultimately triumph.\" Choices A: Humanity\u00b4s destiny is B: to suffer, C: and D: to endure, E: to overcome and triumph.\n\nRationales:\n\n### Demo:\"Humanity\u00b4s\" is the main subject of the sentence. \"destiny\" modifies or describes the subject. Humanity\u00b4s destines is given in the sentence. So \"to suffer, endure, etc.,\" is an infinitive phrase.

The problem describes the situation in which Lilith, a student from my class, is trying to sell her water bottle to fund her friend for her birthday.\n2. The goal is to calculate her income after selling the water bottle to get exactly enough money for her gift.\n3. The first step is to multiply five dozen (5 * 12) to get the number of bottles, which is 60.\n4. The next step is to convert one bottle to twelve bottles by dividing the decimal point value 0.01 and multiplying by 5. It will be equal to 0.6.\n5. The next step is converting the cost of water bottle ($1.85) into dollars and then multiply the cost to the number of bottles to get the total amount ($9.25).", "answer": " 9"}
{"text": "Answer: A: 28\nSolutions: 1. There are two sets (cats and dogs) and we know that the number of cats for both of them is the same. \n2. We know that the number of dogs for Anthony is equal to the number of dogs for Leonel.\n3. We also know that Anthony has twice as many cats as dogs. \n4. Therefore, the number of dogs that both of them have is the sum of the number of twice as many cats the dog that each one of them has.\n5. Therefore, the number is 2/3 of Anthony's number of animals and 7/2 of Leonel's number of animals.\n6. Putting all this information together for each person the number of animals they have is (2/3 * 12) + (7/2 * 10) = 24 + (14/2) = 48, hence the animals total are 48.\n7. The answer is A: 28.\n\n### Input:\"I saw your friend yesterday, 6/10 I've seen 15 times, did you see him?\"\n\n### Response:\"I've seen him 15 times, 8% of them we've done together, and 9/10 of the others were yesterday\"\n\n### Instructions:\n1.

Rational numbers can be written in the form of `p/q` where `p` is the numerator and `q` is the denominator. The denominator is any integer that makes the value represent a natural number, positive and negative. The difference between rational numbers and irrational numbers is that one includes the integers and the other does not. An example of a rational number is the square root of 2, which is a square root of a natural number, while an irrational is the square of a rational number, which is the square of a whole number, like 1 or 2, and is not equal to any natural number.

{"text": "84 pounds of sand\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The question presents an instruction to the reader (you). The user can respond either \"answer the following grade math question\" or answer as the prompt states \"how many pounds of sand did the girls collect in total\".\n2. To determine the total amount of sand the \"they've collected\", we first need to identify the total amount of sand each girl carries.\n3. We already know that Eden carried 4 bags of sand. To determine the amount of sand she carried in each bag, we can subtract 1 bag from 4 baskets.\n5. We know that Mary carried 3 more baskets than Eden. This means she carried 7 more bags. We can use the same logic to determine the total amount of buckets Mary carries.\n33. Iris carried the least number of bags of sand (1 less than Mary). Therefore, she carries 1 fewer bag than Mary.\nWe can now summarize the amount of sand that Eden, Mary, and Iris each carries as follows:\n56, 12, 18.\n\n4. With the information above, we can finally determine the amount of sand they collected.\n\n\n\n5. The sum of the total sand each of the three girls carry is 84 pounds.\n6. Therefore, the three girls collectively carry 84 pounds of sand.\n7. Rather than subtracting the quantities, the user is asked to add these values to determine the total quantity.\n8. If the user subtracted instead, they would have written that Eden carried 2 fewer bags of sand than Mary.\n\n### Exercise:\n\n\n* A: 1. 5\n* B: 2. 8\n* C: 3. 15\n* D: 4. all are correct\n* E: 5. 21\n* F: 6. 4\n* G: 7. 10\n* H: 8. 28\n* I: 9. it is not possible\n* J: 10. 8\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following grade reading question.\n\n## Demonstration: \n\nInput: As you read, be sure to answer all of the questions", "answer": " 34"}

Therefore, 100 is the exact answer. The choice of number \"all\" does not answer this question based on the exact values given in the statement.\n2. The choice \"some\" would mean that there are some fish left. Since the given statement indicates the exact answer (the total number of fish) should be 100, the choice \"all\" is not the correct answer.\n3. The choice \"half\" indicates that there would be 50 fish left and the given statement says that there are 100 fish lef (50 minus the 50 taken), so the answer cannot be half.\n4.

{"text": "Directions: Enter the price of the bag.\n\n### Inputs:\nWhile cultivating a what?\n\n### Answer:\nGiven our input variables, the corn farmer harvested 10 bags. This means that he was able to make $100 worth of sales from that harvest. If he wants to make a $10 profit for each bag, he must sell them for $110. Hence, the correct price for each bag is $110.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe farmer's goal is to make at least a 10% profit on each bag of corn. Here is the equation for our profit:\n\nProfit = $110 - $50 - $35 - $15 = $10\n\nFrom that, we are able to infer that each bag of corn should be sold for $110 to yield a profit of $10 on each bag sold.\n\n### Explanation:\nWe are given an equation that determines the profit the farmer will make per bag. We simply translate our variables into the equation, then translate the profit into the bag's value.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn the end, we are able to confirm that each sale should be priced at $110 since that is how much profit is to be made on each bag of corn sold.\n\n## \nThe task of this practice exercise is to translate the given phrase into another language.

For E, there are 5. For G, there are 4.\nWe can cross out the people who did not complete any of A, B, C and G. For those people, a is a given.\n\nWe get that 3 people need to complete task to qualify as most complex. \n\nIt also needs to be done 10 times, since there are 10 people.

C: poor 4. D: decent E: top-notch\nRationales:1. The given statement says the machine was in \"very good condition\" which means something that is in excellent or fully functional or good.\n2. If the machine was faulty or poorly made or top-notch, these would be the words that would describe it. However, the function of the machine refers to its potential and not the current condition or status of the machine.\n\n3. If we choose a word that isn\u2019t in line with the context of the sentence, the whole sentence would appear to be nonsensical and would create confusion.\n4. \"New\" does not fit as a choice because it indicates that the machine is fresh, which is only the case if it is being sold for the first time.\n5. Similarly, \"top-notch\" does not fit this task since it would imply that the machine is \"really good\", and then it would create a conflict with the current condition of the machine.\n6.

The given statement gives us \"Allyn's house\" hence we can assume that Allyn is the main character of the sentence. We can just start the statement from where we left Allyn.\n2. Therefore, our instruction starts from \"sixty bulb.\"\n3. \"A sixty bulb\" should be hyphenated for the instruction to be written correctly.\n4. The \"A\" should be capitalized.\n5. \"watt\" should be hyphenate for it to be capitalized.\n6. The instruction to pay an electricity bill is unclear and is not followed until this is stated.\n7.

{"text": "Rationale: There are 6 friends from school and 24 friends from the neighborhood. In addition, each of the friends from the school brings another 2 guests. Thus, the total number of guests is 26.\nAnswer: C: 26 guests.\n\n### [Input: Mary went on vacation in August. Mary does not know if she'll go on vacation next year. \nRationale:\n\n* Mary went on vacation at least once, this is proven as \"at least once\" is a part of \"went on vacation\".\n* Mary went either on August or later in the year.

{"text": "The answer is: Kyle threw the ball almost double the distance as that of Parker.\n\n### Rationales: 1) The coach gave 25% more distance of Parker's so Parker's distance is reduced by 1/4 therefore his distance is now equal to 16-1/4\n\n2) Grant's distance is 25% more so he throws the ball the distance he got plus 25% of the distance he got. This is because Grant is already 25% ahead of Parker in terms of distance therefore Grant's distance = distance got by grant +25% of distance got by grant. Grant's distance = (x+y/4)\n\n3) Kyle throws the ball 2*distance got by Parker, therefore, Kyle throws the ball the same distance as Grant threw the ball.

This would be considered the middle of the 21 century.\n* Somewhere in the far future the sun was consumed by the sun's own gravity. Then it happened. Everything died. The humans, and all other life. But the stars were still there. That would be the same as today.(22 century?)\n* A new race emerged. Much more advanced then humans. They colonised and terraformed the planets, finding the resources. They even colonised the sun, by converting it into an artificial star. They lived in a vast empire. This could be considered around the 25th century.\n* At the end of it all, everything came to a end. But then a new universe was created from the last remnants of the dead universe. And the cycle began again.", "answer": " 46"}

{"text": "The answer is c\n\n### InputEmery and Serena can make the trips to the library in one hour but this only happens at times like in the morning or evening. Because of that I will assume that they will travel to the library each and every day in 1 hour but for each they take 20 minutes reading and 20 minutes for traveling to the library. This does not work either way. This because they have to travel and read 4 days when reading 1 day each day that would only take 40 minutes of reading 1 day. So for example that means it is reading 1 day in 60 minute and the same goes for the other 3 days. The final day each person read the same time but they took more time traveling. So they spent more time and since they read 5 times faster than Serena then they would read for 40 minutes and travel for 8 minutes so it would not work. so the result is 20 minutes of reading from each of them at the end is it 20 minutes for serena and 10 minutes for Emery so we can see they do not read at an average because the final day serena has to reach a different time for each of them where Emery does not so the average would be 20 minutes reading for Serena and 10 for Emery.", "answer": " 60"}

They will be asked to create a sum that shows how much is it. If their answer matches with the correct answer, test pass.\n\nIn order to make this program, a user has to select a question and input one answer.\n\nFirst, you should create variables for each option with a number by assigning the string to the number.\n\nThen you must run a while loop that makes a number from 1 to however many questions you want answered in the test. You will start with question 1.\n\nThen you check for a condition, if the number is not equal to one, you should print, \"No. I don't understand the question, try again.\"\n\nOnce the condition is checked, you should make a user input with a string of choice and a number 1.\n\nYou may wish to make a choice by placing an underscore before the answer to create different choices for each number.\nThe input should be like: choice for the questions, 1 for option 1, 2 for option 2, etc. You need to make sure you always make use of the underscore to make sure you don't get a string in for the same question number.\n\nNow, once you pick the answer, you have to make another if statement.\n\nIn this example, we wanted to make sure the user picks A, B, C or D.\nWhen you make the second if statement check for a number between 1 and 9.\nIf you pick a number that is different, you should make a choice that says: No, that's not it. Try again.\n\nOnce you pick an answer, you should assign the answer to each question.\n\nWhen we run the program we will see all the questions asked and a final result at the end.\n\n### Example\n\nFor the first question we have:\n\n```\n-Question 1 The price of a home is 98$ per square foot (sqft).\n-The house is 2,000 sq", "answer": " 333200"}

When Kevin leaves them at home, we can deduce that he prefers lighter items at home; these likely mean he has at least two more empty items than Karen. However, we have no information about the relative weights of the two items Karen brings to work - it appears they may have similar weight, such as both being half of Kevin's work papers or an even sixth of each. If both are equal sixteenths, Kevin will have a heavier bag when they travel together.

{"text": "**Hint: The first thing you need to do is create a set of numbers where you can manipulate them so that you can answer the question.  One way to do that is by using a variable.  Another word for variable in this situation is a string.\n\nThe next thing you want to do is make a new string that we can substitute the variable into.\n\nAt this point you would like to create a string that has the variables for each of the statements in the question.\n\nYou are going to create a variable called totalSpent(with the number 6).  Then you are going to set the variable equal to the total amount spent, i.e. the total spent, times the cost to buy.\n\nNow create a variable called totalResponsed(also containing the number 6). Set it equal to the total spent/12. When 12 is 3 months, we can subtract by 12.\n\nNow we can create a string called totalGaining which will have the format the value of total gained.\n\nThe format (in this case 500/12) is called a format string.\n\nNow set the variable totalGaining equal to the totalResponsed format.\n\nNow replace the variables with the actual numbers when you know them.\n\nWhen you replace the variable totalSpend with 30, replace the variable totalResponded with ( 30/12), and replace the variable totalGain with 500.\n\nThis will come to a total of $75.\n\nWhen you put the result into a format string, you will find that the format string is 21.730769230709034.\n\nTo fix that, simply put a decimal point on it (using the place value concept).\n\nThe new format string will be 21.75.\n\nYou can now use this new string \"21.75\".\n\nThe new response will be 2.

She then paid an additional $16 in sales tax.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe have been solving our math problem based on the data we have been given. We were using the math functions that were given to us. We solved for $16$ after Donna purchased her porcelain vase by applying the formulas that was given to us and rearranging the data so that we could use the math equations.

I am going to subtract the time that it took to clean the house and then take a shower since this is the last thing that he is doing.

This means that the equation for reading pages is 2w/L(2); since there are 2 weeks in a week, we have 2w = 2w/L = 2L; if we let p equal pages read each day, then we have 2L = p(2).

{"text": "1.8 times the number of cats Anthony has\n\n### Input2:Anthony's wife was frustrated because she could never find her eyeglasses. There were too many in her drawer, too many pairs scattered across the counters and table, and way too many on the floor. There were even a few in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom. One day while she was trying to figure out where her glasses were, she came across a secret drawer in the cupboard. The drawer was quite deep, so she was able to hide the glasses inside and reach them easily. One morning when she discovered the secret drawer, she decided to keep it as a surprise and didn't tell any of her family members that she now knew of it. In addition, there are the same number of pairs of eyeglasses as in her medicine cabinet as there are family members in her house. How many pairs of glasses were in the drawer?\n##\n### Demonstaion: Anthony and his wife were frustrated due to her lost glasses. As the number of glasses are the same with her medicine cabinet, we can know there are 4 families members and there was one secret drawer in the cabinet. There were 12 cats with 2/3 of the cats are cats, let c is the number of the cats with c>=0, so the number of the c is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 12. Let's write the number of cats as an ordered set [c], so it becomes [[c]] = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. So the equation of c+([c])=(12*2/3)-[c], when we solve it for c, we can find the number of the c by getting 3*[c],and get the answer, [[c]] = [14,18,10] so the answer is '24'.\n\n### Question:How many pairs of glasses are in the closet?\n\n### Question2:Anthony decided to build a new house out in the country and asked his architect to design a room with one door and one window.

{"text": "4 more sandwiches\n\n### Notes:\n\n    Explanation of the steps for the answer:\n    \n    We can reason that Samson eats more sandwiches at luch than he does at night, so we know 3 * 1 > 4 (lunch > night total sandwiches).\n    Therefore, 3 * 1 = 3 = (3 sandwiches at dinner) + (4 * (dinner total > lunch total)) - (3 sandwiches for breakfast)\n\n    We know he eats 3 sandwiches for dinner, which is the same as he eats at lunch, so, we subtract 4 * (lunch total > dinner total) from the 3 sandwiches he ate at lunch. We subtract the 4 * (luch total > dinner total) because it was at dinner the day before the following, so, that night's lunch would be more. So, he ate 3 sandiches at lunch and 3 sandwiches the following luch, for a total of 6.\n    Finally, it says (lunch total > night total), but we just figured out that (lunch total > lunch total), so, if this says night, so we don't have to subtract anything, which is easier.\n\n    2. Now Samson eats one sandich at night, and we subtract one sandich from 6 because you always start counting at 1, just as the next morning with breakfast, he ate 6 sandiches at lch and at dinner the next lunch, 4, for a total of (6 + 4) = 10.\n    \n    How many more sandwichs he eats on Monday than Tuesay?\n    \n    Samson eats 10 sandiches on Monday which is more than 6 on Tuesay, so, he eats 4 more sandiches total on Monday than Tuesady", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "The correct answer is \"10\".\n\n### Explanation:You are asked, \"How many students in this class DO NOT play either game?\" You assume that the students that DO play either game were either \"both, one, or zero\".\n\nThe only students who DON'T play BOTH sports DO play either basketball OR volleyball. Since \"half\" of the students play basketball, and four fifth of the remaining play volleyball, two thirds do NOT play volleyball. Therefore, any student who played only volleyball or only basketball DON'T play both basketball and vollyball.\n\nThe only students left are the 5 who played both sports, and the number of students that DO NOT play basketball AND volleyball is subtracting by \"11\" from 20 (20/5 gives us \"4\" which is equal to \"11\").", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "8.67\n\n### Reasoning:\nWhen a question is asked for an average, the answer is always the sum of the given numbers and dividing them by the sum of the numbers given. If each number was given and the formula is correct, the average of each number should come up to the average of the given numbers. In order to get the average of the given answers is to find the sum of the given answers and divide them by two. When the two answers are divided, it is also important to know that each answer will be divided into itself with a remainder. The remainder gives us a good idea of how good of an answer the number is. In order to find the sum of all given numbers and divide them by two, you must know the sum. This is achieved by multiplying the given numbers. If you multiply Jeff and Sam, the product will be Jeff Sam. Sam is an integer, and Jeff is an integer. Both of Sam's numbers are not in order of priority and Jeff's numbers are ordered by priority. Sam's numbers are in priority because they are the two given numbers for the average. If the given numbers are 1,2,3,4 and the sum is 10, the remainder will be 7. The answer can be found when you divide 10 by 2, and then divided the product by 7. When you do this, the answer is 5.55. Since the remainder is divisible by 5, the answer will be 5.55", "answer": " 14"}

{"text": "6.9+\n\n### Solution:This is a question about calculating the average. To get the average, you take the total number of apples over the weeks, and then divide that number by how many weeks. So, in week one, Archibald eats 30 apples, and in week two, he eats 40 apples. We can do this using our addition formulas for the difference of two counting numbers.\n\nFirst, we get 3 = (30-40). Then, we have 3+4 = (30+40). So, we get (30+4)=24. Finally, we multiply that by 2. This gives us 48.\n\nSimilarly, in week (3), Archibald eats (90-30) = 60, and (90+30) = 120. In other words, over the 7 weeks, he eats a total of 520 apples.\n\nArchibald eats (520/7)=75 apples a week. Therefore, Archibald's average is 75 apples a day.\n\n\n### Input :You add 3, 4, 8, 12, 27, 54, 108.

There are twice as  many red Balls as blue while the rest ar green. If there are  11 blue Balls how many green Balls are there\n\nIt's a bit tricky to figure out how to answer, but the answer is obvious if you really have to ask how many green balls are in that combination of choices.\n\nIn the image below, there are some green balls and then some red balls. If there are twice as many reds as greens, then subtract the greens from what you already were thinking. The difference is the red balls. Then count the red balls and subtract the remaining greens from the original. In this case, there were 8 greens. 8 - 11 is equal to -3.

{"text": "The formula for distance covered given a constant speed is v for variable speed in feet per second for the time given in seconds. Let `x` be the distance covered by the cheetah, so then:\n\n`x = v * t`\n\nThen:\n\n`x / 210 = v * t`  (Divided by 210, you are dividing the total distance to the first animal by the total distance to the second animal in order to account for the cheetah not gaining 210 feet by its acceleration.)\n\nThen:\n`x / 105 = vt / t`\n\nThen `t = 105 / x`\n\nThen `x = 105 * t`\n\n`105 / x = vt`\n\n`vt = 101` which is what you wanted already.\n\n### Solution:\n\nThe formula for distance that can be traversed given a fixed or variable speed (expressed in feet per second) is `d = v * t`, where `d` is the distance (expressed in feet). Assume that both the gazelle and the cheetah are running with the same velocity `v` and that both are running in the same direction. If we know that `x`, the distance from the starting point of the gazelle and `y`, the distance from the first point of the cheetah are `d_1 > d_2`, then we can say that `dt = d_2 - d_1`. If the following is true:\n\n`y = v * t` where `t` is the time (expressed in seconds).\nWe can then combine two equations to produce:\n\n`(dt) * v = (y - d_1)`\n\nBy solving for `t` we obtain:\n\n`t = (dt) / v`\n\nAnd since `t = d_1 / v`, we can say that `t = dt / v * d_1`\n\nIf then we know that:\n`x = d_1 / d_2`\nThen:\n`t = dt / v + x * d_2 / d_1`\nAnd `x = d_1 * t / d_2` which means that:\n`d_1 * t = d_1 * dt / v", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "Bill picked 52 apples from the orchards.  He sent each of his two children to school each carrying 3 apples to their preferred teacher.  Jill used 10 apples each to create two apple pies.  That leaves Bill with 3 apples he can either use to bake more pies or just eat them by himself.\n\n### Input2:How likely is it that Bill picks more apples than he actually does?\n\n### Demo:\nThe data is based on Bill doing a simple calculation in his head.  Bill could easily pick more than three apples, however, he was busy with his two children which caused him to make a mistake. \n\nThat leaves Bill with 53 apples but he does not know that.\n\n### Demo2:\nWhat mistake(s) did Bill make if he has an even amount of apples between the five who use apples and ate apples when in reality, only three apples were given to each?  If there are more than three apples given to each person, then bill has some extra apples that he can do with them.  If there are less, then bill may run out and needs to go to the orchards again to gather more.  \n\n### Demo3:\nBill picks 50 apples.  He sends 1 apple to each of his 4 children, leaving him one apple.  He gives 3 more apples to his favorite teacher, giving him 2 apples left.  Bill gives 10 apples of the 2 he has left to bake 2 apple pies.  This leaves Bill with 0 apples.  Bill did not make a mistake as his children took out some more apples than he really gave them.  He was correct at the beginning and ending.\n\n\n### Output:\n\n### Code:\n```\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n  int i;\n  float y;\n  string str;\n  cout << \"Enter the first value of x to be printed in the first x (1-10)\";\n  cin >> i;\n  x = i;\n  cout << x << endl;\n  cout << \"\\n\\n\";\n  while(i <= 10)", "answer": " 24"}

What is the radius?\n\n### Explanation of Solution:\n\nLet $$c = ac + b,$$ where $$c = 2$$ and $$a = n^2, b=n,$$ and $$n = n + 1.$$ The radius is $$\\frac{c}{2} = \\frac{a c}{2} + \\frac{b}{2} = \\sqrt[2]{n^2 n+n},$$ where we know $n+1 = n$ and that $$n^2  = 2n + 1$$\n\n### Input3: Find the length of a radius of a circle with 1,122.25 square feet of area with 1 inch sides, and a diameter of 1070 units.\n\n### Explaination of Solution:\n\nAssuming that the units, \"units\" or \"u\", have a conversion factor, let $$c = ac +b,$$ where $$c$$ is our unknown radius, $$a$$ is area and $$b$$ is the diameter. Thus, $$c^2 = a$$ and so $$c = 1070 \\sqrt[2]{1122.26}$$\n\n### Input4: Find the dimensions of a cube with area 60 ft^2 and volume 33 ft^3\n\n### Explication of Solution:\n\nIf the cube has these dimensions, then $$V = B$$ where $$33 = 60\\cdot b$$ and $$b = \\sqrt", "answer": " 90"}

{"text": "Answer: D: I don't know because we are not given any information for the second ball\n\n#### Commentary:\nCommentary: I did not see any instructions for the second ball of yarn so am unsure how many feet I have to go with. The answer seems to be correct but I had to use a guess. I think that the next question should include the answer to this question.\n\n## Input:In school, the average grade point average (GPA) for students is 2.93. At a meeting, the teacher asked a class if there was a student who was in that class with a GPA greater than 3. The student with the higher GPA was the 12th student in that class. If there are 20 students in that class, how many students were at that meeting.\n\n## Response:\n\nAnswer: A: I don't understand what to do for the question. Am I supposed to do an equation? This question is confusing.\n\nAnswer: B: Is the answer C? I don't understand why we would multiply the 2.93 and 12 to get the answer. Is there 20 students in the classroom? Maybe I am not understanding because we do not know how many students are in the classroom. If I were to know how many students are there then it would make more sense. I would have to do a lot more research to find the answer.\n\nAnswer: C: Am not sure where to start. There is no information on how many students are in that class. We have the answer but it is unclear how the teacher got the answer based on the information given to us. If the teacher used 20 of the students to determine what the average was (I am guessing that is what he/she did), then that would mean they used 18 of the students but got 19 in the answers. How is that possible?\n\n## Commentary:\n\nCommentary: This question was very confusing. I was not sure what to do with this answer at all.

P(RR|Nr)=P(draw red after drawing green)/(P(draw green again \\ NOT \\ red after drawing green | red \\ NOT \\ green) + P(draw red after drawing red first AND green first | red \\ NOT \\  green)). Since the last part is 1, we can cancel it out with the first part. The probability for red after drawing green will always be 1 because there is only one way to do it. We get this equation for the final probability of drawing a red. This is how you can find any probability. You have to figure out what the options are first and then make sure they all have equal probabilities. For instance, If you roll a red ball out of 7 balls, the probability of it being red is.76, which is why in a game like roulette that have red and black as the possible choices, the red ball has a higher chance at landing on red because it's much more likely than the black ball", "answer": " 20"}

A bubble is a single gassy bead within the liquid of a bottle of soda. A single bottle of regular soda has an indefinite number of bottles in it.

{"text": "There are 14 key limes.\n\n### Input\n\nIn 1995, the US Department of Defense announced it had broken the Enigma code during World War II. The Enigma code was a cipher that the Axis used to encrypt its messages prior to the war. The US did not recognize the cipher, but with the war looming and the lack of a better option, the Enigma was invented and used by the Axis powers. The US learned the key to the Enigma in 1942, after decoding a message that proved critical. Before the war, they had been trying to develop a cipher machine to compete with the Enigma, but had no idea what it looked like. The Enigma was a combination code machine that was electromechanical and had three switches and 26 letters.\n\nIn order to break the code, the US military had to find a way to get the code sheet, which was a one-time pad sheet that contained a sequence of encrypted letters based on two keys. That key was a part of the cipher machine, but the Axis had to manually input the keys to the machine. In 1941 and 1942 alone, the codes on the machines changed twice and the cipher was used by 4,000 people who were trying to get messages out to the commanders.\n\nThe Axis had a way to change the keys, and the US was on to something with their inventions, but they didn\u2019t know what the Axis was doing. The United States Army eventually developed a machine called the Lorenz, a replacement for the Enigma, and later created a machine that the Germans used to encipher messages. In 1939, the US Navy sent a message to the U-201 and asked him to send two more messages to Germany. In response, the U-205 sent three messages back to Germany and asked for a message from the Aryan Steelworks. The Aryan Steel works was the Axis\u2019 headquarters, and the US had to find the message from that headquarters so they could break into the code. However, in 1941, the Nazi leaders started using the Lorenz cipher, a new encryption method.\n\n### Question\n\nIn 1841, the German Navy invented a ci", "answer": " 8"}

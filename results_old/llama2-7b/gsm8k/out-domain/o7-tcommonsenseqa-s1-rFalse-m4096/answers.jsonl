This is known as the chicken and egg problem, and is used to illustrate how logical problems arise with chained dependencies on causation.\n> One can answer that \"yes, the chicken came before the egg\" but this is only true because we're not considering both things at the same time. When we examine both things at once, it's clear that one follows the other.

The number of balls that I have in my ball collection is six fewer than the number of balls in one whole bunch. I have two fewer balls than half the bunch. I have five more balls than a random bunch has and four times to many balls in the whole bunch. I also have 11 fewer balls than half the balls in the whole bunch put together. Which means I have the answer? My grand-dog came up with all these answers to my question, so that means he and I are right to think so. Oh... and the answer is 42, like a computer code, if you know about computers. How did you think that the answer was 2?\"\n\n### Response:\"I can help you by describing how I solved your problem. I began by determining the number of balls you have in all the bunches. The number is 6 times 2, which is twelve. I thought that half of 12 was 6. Then divided the number of balls you actually have by 1 to get the number of balls you are missing. I saw that your grand-dog said that your question was two away. So, the number that you wanted to solve for is: Number of balls you must take out of a set to get to 42 (which is the number of balls in the bunch). In this question, a set must have at least 11 balls since it must have five times 7 balls to fill a total of 7 sets. Subtracting the number of balls in your bunch from the number of balls you will need to get your bunch to 42, I came up with 6 times 2-6, minus 6 which is 6 times 3 or 18. This was the closest answer I could get in terms of number of bunches. You can also say a little different way: Number of balls you will have", "answer": " 8"}

Her pain was due to how much she ate, so it must be proportional to how much she a ate.  If Jenny's stummy is just proportional to how much she eats, then 5 times more than what she ate would mean 5 times more pain.

{"text": "Ann cuts a 4 ft by 6 ft rectangle for the living room. She also cut a 2 ft by 4 ft rectangle for the bedroom, but she still has over a foot for her to maneuver. When subtracting, it tells me that she has 4 ft less than 4 ft, and 2 ft less than 2 ft. I multiply each foot by 12 (feet) and by 16 (inch) and plug these numbers in the following: 4 X 12 + 2 X 12 = 76 in square inches for living room. Now that I know the living room needs 76 inches more to meet the 16 ft by 12 ft total of the fabric, I multiply that by 16 (to find how much footage she has left) and get 1240 inches of footage left for the living room and by 12 (to be in feet) she gets 148 feet of fabric remaining for the living room totaling 148 ft of fabric remaining for the 6 foot by 4 foot living room.\n\nFor the bed room she cut that same amount but for a 2 ft by by 4 ft area, I multiply that by the feet to get how much remaining there. 2 ft does not have any extra footage and she needs extra for the living room, so 2 inch has to be calculated. 2 X 16 X 12 = ___ 32 feet of fabric remaining for bedroom. Now we can add all of the footage together. 4 ft + 2 ft = 6 ft + 32 ft = 38 ft 148 ft - 38 = 110 ft is what she has left of the fabric, which would take 110 feet to get her to the 16 ft she needs by 12 ft she started off with.\n\n### Input : The train station was on time.

{"text": "The question asks, \"How much more expensive, per (cans), is this deal at the (grocery) store?\", which means that there are 12 cans in the deal in question.  The grocery store has 12 can per package and is $6.00.  Multiply by 12 and the answer is $72.00 for the grocery store.

I have one slice of bread, but I don't have any cheese or meat for my sandwich. I have two options at the deli. There is a turkey sandwich that costs ten dollars and a meatless sandwich that costs fifteen. If I buy the sandwich that costs fifteen dollars, how much more does the meatless sandwich cost than the turkey? \n### Response\n\nThe cost question can be read as, how much more does a meatless sandwich cost.  There is the cost for $15 and there is $0.50 for each cheese I add to the sandwich.  Add $15 to $0.50 and the answer is $3.\n\n### Response\nThe question here is, \"If I buy the sandwich with 5 meat, how much more does it would cost than it would if I were to buy a sandwich with 1 meat?\" \nSince there are two choices, there must be more than 1 meat.  In the question it states that the sandwich with 1 more meat is $12 and the sandwich with 2 more meat is $15.  How many more? $15 - $12.\nOne more meat is $10 x 5.6 and then add $8 for 1 piece.  Then, $5.60 * 6 + $8.\n$\n\n### Response \nThe question states, \"You have a cup of coffee and you pay for it, next week you have a cup of water and you pay for that too.\"  The question then asks, \"What did you pay for each cup of water last week?\"  The answer is $0.00", "answer": " 25"}

It would be difficult for someone to travel alone, because a person would have to be able to talk to themselves, and only have themselves to blame for getting lost or making a wrong turn.

{"text": "The other friends each received $0.\n\n### Input/Output Example:\nInput: The number of a house is 2712. Arnel had ten boxes of matches. He used five matches, while sharing the remaining matches equally with his five friends, each friend receives 0 matches. What number of matches does he have after sharing?\n\nOutput: He got 72 matches, and has 32 matches left.\n\n### Explaining Solutions: If the statement, \"the number of matches is...\", is put into the instruction: the result should be true. To illustrate, we can compare Arnel's situation with a grocery market. If the number of matches in the match box is 6, then if he shares the matches, the amount in use will remain 3. This is because if he takes 2 from the box, he still has 4 remaining and the amount is still equal to the number of matches he shared with ten friends. This logic works in two-way and both direction for the statement.\n\n### Problems: Input/output example:\n\nInput:Arnel had ten books. He had already read two of them. After sharing his books with his parents, brother and six friends, each of them getting one book, he found that his sibling got six of the books. How many books did Arnel have after the sharing with a total of eight other people?\n\nOutput: The correct answer was: seven.\n\n### Discussion:\n\nAfter analyzing the instructions and input/output of two problems, the following points became clear.

I was very enthralled by the amount of information stored in a database of the plane's dimensions, 3d models, and other engineering software that was used to develop the program. The more time that I spent in the company, the more I fell in love with using data science, and I began to understand how important data science is to the 21st century.

{"text": "At first, we know that the promotional subscription would be cheaper than the normal one. We also understand that we would need to use the fact that 0.25 is 10.4% of 2 for the problem. Finally, to reduce the cost, we need to find out the 18 months multiplied by 2 as well as the normal 18-month price. So, 18 multiplied by 2, $18\u00d72 = $36. At this point, we have three options available. Either the promotional subscription will be $34-$36, or $34.84. Finally, dividing the normal 18 month price from the promotional price will give us the difference. The promotional price is going to be cheaper because the normal 18x2 is $57.60.

{"text": "The first step in your task is to create a formula.  To do this you need to make two decisions.  You need to make decisions about the variables in your formula.  How many ropes are there?  How long is each rope?  You also need to decide on an operation in your formula.  You want to do something with the two values.  How many rope pieces are there?  You need to create a formula to do this.  We can do this with the use of 6 different symbols.  Let us begin!\n\nFirst, let's begin the process of developing a formula.  What is the first variable?  There are two types of variables.  These are independent and dependent.  Independent variables are variables you can control.  The dependent variable is the one that is affected by whatever control is on the independent variable.\n\nNext, we will do what is know as an algebraic operation.  This operation combines the control and the dependent variable.  The first operation you should use is subtraction.  You subtract the length of a rope from the control.  This will leave you with the new value required to get the control.  The formula should read:\n\n$$60 - 2900 / 45 = 2.$$\n\nNext, you need to do what will be known as inverse operations.  These operations are the ones that undo each other in a pair.  The inverse of subtraction is multiplication.  Then you multiply the number by one half of the control.  The control has changed.  The formula is:\n\n$$6.90 / 30=.023.$$\n\nNow, you will use what is known as a division operation.  This operation reduces values by a standard or control.  You would need to divide the new value by one half. This results in\n\n$$6.335/.025 == 259.219.$$\n\nNext, we do a calculation known as an addition operation.  This operation is the opposite of subtraction.  This gives you a new value by adding a number.  The formula becomes:\n\n$$259.220++ 2900 == 30.\\overline{007}6967.$$\n\nNext, another division operation.  You will get another value from the control and", "answer": " 4"}

Instead, I can describe the different parts of a question and a response. I don't want to say that you need to answer in the exact way I have described, but I find that if I can provide a complete definition, I can guide you to the right answer.\n\nFor questions of all kinds, I find it useful to talk about the **input** and the **output**.

Does it require some critical thinking? Does it demonstrate the difference between two groups of people? Does it require creativity?\n\n### Input Example:\nWhen I tell you that a piece of paper has a width of `11 / 4` in, I'm asking for some information that can be used to solve the problem.

Some places like Tokyo, Japan, are in the middle of the most populated area in the world, for a home there you would need a lot of space where other people could not live because they do not want to be with anyone close to them. At an extreme opposite end of the spectrum would be an incredibly isolated place, say one in Antarctica, where your house would be an igloo but you could have whatever space you wanted between other homes. Most of the time, however, you would live in a place where there are many other homes around you. In those areas you would live in a building that is somewhere between those two extremes.

The pine trees were the closest source of wood. But the truck can hold only six pieces of wood, which is not enough for a one-piece board. \n\n1.\tHow can they make the board?\n\n2.\tHow much wood would be needed for it?\n\n3.\tWould it be cheaper to make half a board? Explain.\n\n4.\tWould it make a difference if they could take all the wood in one piece out of the tree trunks? Explain.\n#### Demonstration\nThe carpenters should use glue to join the pieces of the board. Each six pieces would also need six pieces of wood to glue, for a total of 96 pieces of wood. To make it easier to work with the wood, they can cut each piece to half its length. For the length of the board, they will still need 6 pieces of wood. The total amount of wood they will need in the end for the board, is 120 pieces.\n\nThere has to be a point where it is cheaper to make more than one board of half its length. The carpenters should make the board of one-quarter length first. They cut that board and join it with the other two boards of half its length together. This way, they will save money, and the wood will not be wasted. The total amount of money they spend after making the board is 108. The cheapest way to make the board would be to use 6 pieces of wood instead of 12 pieces. \n\nIf they could take all the pieces of wood from a tree trunk with one go and avoid cutting them with a saw, they probably would need a lot fewer wood.\n\n### Input\nWhat are the three types of variables?\n\n### Demostration\nA number that is not subject to change is the constant. \n\nThe variable is what is not  constantly changing.

However, the code should be written in more than one format. In this question, the user asked how many animals \"Ed\" had, with the initial question being centered around \"2 dogs.\" In your code, you assumed that the question is referring to the whole set of animals and gave a specific answer, which doesn't necessarily correspond to what the user asked. Here, the animals are separated in two separate sections with \"Ed\" being the animal who has 2 dogs, and \"the set of animals\" being the total. You answered according to the two separated sections and gave the answer for both sections. In another example, you might have answered \"Ed\" had \"2 dogs and 2 cats, and 5 fish in total (2 of fish being from the set of animals)\" or \"Ed has 2 dogs and the set of animals has 5 fish in total.\" There are two answers, because you have two sets of animals.

Betty sat in the room for 2 hours before going to bed. She read for a little more than 3/4 of the time while she was in the room.  The book she read is very light and only required occasional turning of the pages.\n\n### Question:\nBy what maximum percentage could the comfort level in her bedroom have increased if the room were occupied when she was reading?\n\n### Solution:\nThe answer is 51.5%, because she spent 75 percent of the time in the room with the air conditioner on, and the room affected the bedroom, increasing the comfort level by 25 percent.", "answer": " 6"}

If it's un-necessary, keep the return in a new line.\n- Don't capitalize function names unless it's important to distinguish.\n- When you have complex functions to pass to \"main\", only pass them separated by spaces. Don't put the \"main\" parameter in a function parameter list.\n- Make sure every parameter you pass to any function has a type annotation. Doing so also gives you a type hint to the rests of the code.\n- Pep8 (https://python-mode.com/docs/tutorials/pep-8/)\n- PEP-0008\n- Use the most recent version of Python (3.9", "answer": " 32"}

{"text": "Antonio will eat 8 meatballs.\n\nAntonio's family consists of 8 family members including Antonio. Antonio makes 8 meatballs per pound of hamurger.  Antonio uses 4 pounds of hamurger to prepare his meatballs. To find the number of meatballs that each party member will eat, Antonio must divide his 4 pounds of hamiltonier by 8 (his number of family members including himself), which equals.5, rounded to the nearest tenth, which he can equate to five, which means that each family member would eat a half meatball.  Because Antonio makes 8 meat balls per pound of hamburguer, that means he will make 40 meatballs in total.  Each member of the family will eat 40/8 meatballs. 8/40 times 4 equals 6.  Therefore, Antonio will eat 6 meatballs.", "answer": " 4"}

For instance, if you purchased fruits at grocery and vegetables at shopping, the cost of every single vegetable and fruit you bought at grocery will be counted in grocery cents but they will be ignored when shopping. On the other hand, those vegetables or fruits sold at shopping will be counted in shopping cent. \n\n### Inputs:A 20 gallon barrel is a quarter filled with orange juice, what volume of orange juice can be poured from it?\n\n### Input 2: A man and woman each have enough 5 cent coins to change 2 quarters for a nickel, they each have 50 cents left over, how much did they spend?\n\n### Instructions : 1.

{"text": "#### What I learned:\nThe first step I did while solving the problem was getting the numbers of days in March to know how many times they went to the pool before. I did this because I knew I could use the multiplication equation to divide the numbers and get the total number of times they went to the pools in March, based on the fact that the number of times would be divided equally among the 4 weeks which were Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\nI also found that by doing some counting, I could also see where my answer is supposed to go since that would enable me calculate the number of times they swam in a week. I found this to be the hardest step.\n\n#### Question/task\n\n#### What else I know:\nIn solving math problems, you use the multiplication equation as an approach. It is a tool used to solve multiplication, subtraction, division and addition. You get numbers from one equation in the problem, to substitute for another, thus enabling you solve for the answer. \n\nIn the real world, I think multiplication can easily be used in shopping. Most especially when counting how many items will be for the group.\n\tI think the same in solving division problems, multiplication can be used as a formula. For example the question below:\n\n\tRaymond went camping. Each year his parents buy him two boxes of peanut butter crackers and four loaves of bread. If he bought ten slices of bread for every three pounds of groceries how much groceries did Raymond purchase?\nA) 2000 pounds of groceries\nB) 3500 pounds of grocery C) 5000 pounds of food D) 6500 pounds of food E) 7000 pounds of goods\n\n#### Reasons/importance - How I applied this in real world setting\n\nA multiplicative equation is also used in a lot of places such as cooking, shopping and planning. In the event of cooking, multiplication is used so that you can find out how much water to put in the pot of pasta. This is because you'll put the same amount of water used for the first amount of pasta to another when cooking multiple bags of pasta.\n\nTo find the answer to \"Raymond went campinig\", I also used this", "answer": " 2"}

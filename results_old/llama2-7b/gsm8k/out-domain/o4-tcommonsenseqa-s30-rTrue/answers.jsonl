Then, 10 + (6 + 6) + 4 = 10 + 12 + 4 = 26.  So, the box weighs 10+26+4 = 40 in all.)  Since the box starts out weighing 2 pounds (after jelly beans), the box must have ended up weighing 6 pounds (of beans only).  After it has been tripled (by added brownies), it weighs 7 pounds (or 0.7 x 52).  With 2 more pounds of jelly beams added, its total weight is 9 pounds (9 x1.75).  After all the gummy worms are added, the container's weight is 10 pounds ( 4 x 2.5).  Total 9 + 7 + 4 + 2 = 9 + 7 x 2 + 4 x 2 = 45  (The sum of all the units is 28, so to get 45, 13 more beans are packed in to bring up to 45).

Your phone's data connection allows phone to send and receive data like images, text and others. It can be connected to the internet through its data plans. \nThe WiFi connection uses a wireless network to connect with internet. \nData for WiFi calling, is not WiFi itself. It's not connected to the phone's data plans and is instead connected to the WiFi router. The phone data can not be used for WiFi calling.\nTo access internet with phone's data you need to have a data package like 1GB plan from your service provider.

Thus, the cow was sold for $3 per poud weight.\n\n4. Thus, the cow weighs 1,200 pounds in total.\n5. Now, suppose there is another customer who wants to purchase cow for $3 per lb.\n6. How much does he have to pay if John sells the cow at the same price of $3 per pound?\n7. So, multiply 1200 lb in 1,20 pound.\n8. Thus, the value of the cow is $3600.", "answer": " 600"}

Choices: 1. A: Look at the bottom of his shoes 2. B: Look on the ground 3. C: Look inside the fountain 4. D: Look at the top of the fountain 5. E: Nothing else\nRationales:\n1. The question indicates that the man was standing beneath the fountain, and he needs to move on from that location.\n2. If he wanted to have a closer look at the statue, he could have taken a good look at the statue without actually going below the fountain. Standing below it simply means that he did not want to step up to the statue.\n3. The man was not expecting to see anything under the fountain since he was not looking at the bottom of his feet.\n4. It is unlikely that he was looking at the top of the statue because he has a closer look at the bottom of his foot rather than that.\n5. If he wanted to look at anything else, there should be something on the ground, but he does not stop to look at anything else.\n6. In other words, the man has no intention of moving forward in time after standing below the fountain at the same location.\n7.

We also learnt that is travels at a speed of 12 miles per after than it travels on flat sand. When riding on uphill inclined it travels at 18 miles slower than when it rides on flat sand. He has been riding for 1/3rd of the time on flat, 1/3 rd of the time on upright and 1/3rd on downhill.\n\nNow from the equation (x*1/3)+(y*1/3)+ (z*1/3), the result becomes (x+y+z)/3. For the given values 12/3, 21/3 and 11/3,\nthe resultant becomes = 53.5.\n\nThis becomes 3*x+2*y+1*z = 53. Also, the options give are B,C and D.\nSince this is an arithmetic problem, one can perform the process by either by adding or subtracting x and y and also subtracting x and z. But 53 is not an option for subtracting x and y neither is it an option for subtracting y and z.\nTherefore, this is an addition problem.\n\nSubstitute the answer in C, D and E and then eliminate options E.\nThis gives C(x+y+z)=53. This gives C*x+C*y+C*z=53.  So x+y+z=52. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C which reads 53.5 and hence the answer is C.", "answer": " 58"}

Choices:  A. Water B. Fat C. Muscle D. Inflammation\nRationales: Water fluctuation refers to change in body water caused by fluctuations in fluid balance, while fat and muscle remain relatively constant. Since the body does not typically fluctuate much in its water content, one can infer that the answer is D, which represents the most credible candidate.\n\n### Output: The most accurate answer:\n\n- The most accurate answer from the choices is c, because the word \"fluctuations\" appears in the prompt and it shows how the choices can be narrowed down to one option. \n- In the 1st sentence, \"fluctuate the most\" is a clause, so the verb is the subject. A clause always follows the verb. \n- In sentence 2 \"fluctuation is a primary cause of\" is a subordinate clause. The subject is \"fluctuation\" because a subordinate clause always follows a principal clause.\n- The last sentence, \"fluctuation in the body\" is the direct object, \"fluctuations in\" is the subject, and \"body\" is the indirect object. So the answer is c.\n\n### Testing the Output\n\n#### Input: Most people's weight fluteduates by more than 3 pounds throughout the year.

To save time and avoid repetition, we will use the notation h represents the holes and c is the rate of leakage.\n* We will compute the amount of water that each hole leaked.\n\nTo calculate the amount of water that the holes leaked, we need to solve the following system\nof equations:\n\n3h3 = 2c\n2c = h2/2\nh3 = (h2 * 3)/ 2\nh3 = 3h2 or h3 = 3(2-h/2)\nOr, h3 = 3-2h.\nOnce we got the solution(s) for the above equations, we can substitute them in\nthe original question to compute the amount of water they leaked.\n\nLet h = 2, in this case,  h = 6\n\nh3 = 63 = 216 = 21 ouncess of water.\n\n# Taking a closer look at the instruction (Step 2)\nThis is the second step in the process of solving the task.\n\nThere are several ways to approach the task, but we recommend using a strategy that involves breaking the question into manageable pieces and simplifying the problem as much as possible.\nHere are a few tips to help you achieve this:.\n1.

{"text": "**Suggested Answer**: (Option C)Harry earned $375 in a week.\n\n### Explanation:\n**Rationale**:\n  1. The total number of dogs that Harry walked in a week is a total of 28(28 dogs).\n  2. As per the question, the numbers of dogs Harry walks on Monday, Wednesday and Friday are 7, 7 and 7 respectively and their total is 21.\n  3. The number of dogs Harry walks in a week is 7+12+9=28.\n  4. Since total number of dogs=28, then the number of dogs walk by Harry on Tuesday=12. And the total money is $600.\n  5. Now, we need to calculate the number of days Harry walks 12=Monday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n    Number of days on which he walks 1 dog=0.(As per the question it tells that he works only on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays)\n    Number of days he walks 2 dogs=1(The number of days Tuesday)\n    Number of day he walks 3 dogs=2(he works on Wednesdays and Thursdays)\n    Number of Days Harry walks four dogs=3(he works on thursdays.)\n    Number of Days he walks 5 dogs=4\n    Number of days Harry walks six dogs=5\n    Number of days He walks 7 dogs =6\n    Number of days the Harry walks 8 dogs =7\n  6. So, the total money earned by Harry = $5*$9*(6+7+4+5+3+2)=$55$4$. \n  7. Therefore, the total money Harry earned in a week=Number of dogs+Days of week work, the total =28+7=35\n\n  8. To find total 28+7= $ 35 we need to subtract 3-3-1 because the number of day Harry work on 1,2,3 dogs are zero, and the total 28-35=35.\n  9.

We need to determine how many servings are in the 150 ML volume using our formula volume = servings x 150ml.\n3. Our volume = 500ml*100ml = 50000ml - we know that this is not equal to total, so we must find a ratio.\n4. We know that our volume is 5000, which means our ratio is 500:100. \n5. We cannot solve this directly, so we must find the ratio again.\n6. Our ratio becomes 500:500 = 1:1 - this is why there is the *1000ml in the final answer.\n7. We know that we need to solve for 1000ml because we want to find the servings in our ratio:\n8. Volume = servings * 150ml; which means we need to find servings in our expression, so substitution is required: volume = servings * 450ml.\n9. Now the equation is: servings = 150ml/volume.\n10.

My father, mother and I took a plane to Africa. Our first stop was in South Africa and we spent two weeks there. During the two weeks we visited many game reserves and got to see many wild animals. We saw giraffes, hippos, zebras, elephants, and many kinds of birds, such as ostriches, toucans, and flamingos. But the highlight of these trips were definitely the safaris. We never had to be cooped up in a car for long hours during a safari. Every safari trip had a picnic breakfast for us to enjoy. Afterwards, a jeep would pick all us up and take us on a safari. We would get our picnic lunch shortly after the jeep picked us up. Then the Jeep would take us to some remote area where the monkeys were located. Here we would have the opportunity to see the monkeys up close. The one time that I can remember getting to see the monkeys, they were on top of a tree and I could see them very well. I was just behind the jeep, which had a large tree by the side of the road. The baboons were so close that I could see the dirt on the monkeys' face. My father informed us that the monkeys didn't want the babies on top of the tree jumping around. They tried to protect their monkeys. In the evening, we would return back and have dinner. The meals at the restaurant were always good and full of healthy food, such as chicken, pork, and pasta. We left South Africa and went to East Africa. East Africa had many of the same animals as South Africa. The only difference is that the safari trips were more interesting. The animals would come closer to the car to drink the water. Also the lions would attack buffaloes and the lions would often be victorious. East Aruica had just as many exciting events as those in South Africa although the monkeys", "answer": " 120"}

To answer the question correctly, you also need to know her average number of shells per day on vacation and use it to calculate the total number she had after vacation. As she collected 5 shells per a day for 3 days and 6 shells on one the fourth day, then the average number of shell she collected each day would equal to 5.5. \n5. To calculate 63 shells, we multiply the average number of her shells with 5 days to calculate the total she had after vacation, which equals to 275. 6. Then, we subtract the original 20 shells, the one she started with, which yields the total number of shell she had after vacation which is 298 shells.\n7.

{"text": "The answer choice is D.\n\n### Inputs:\nThe only thing that's certain about this problem is the number of sandwiches that Jimmy will make, and it's an integral number. The first thing that we want to do is try to find a way to figure out the total number of slices of bread required for those sandwiches. \n\nSay we want to calculate the number of sandwich slices given we know the number of sandwich packs. \nTo do so, we'll just multiply the number of sandwich packages (assuming that's known too) by their number of sandwiches (2), which is the total number of whole sandwiches. So, for sandwiches A, the given amount to multiply is 8. \n\nThe way to calculate the number of bread slices per sandwich package is to divide the quantity of sandwiches into the quantity of bread slices. The result will tell us the number bread slices for a given sandwich, which when multiplied by the number of sandwich makes the number of slices needed for making our 8 sandwiches. There are different ways to write this, but we'll start with what you already know from the problem. This formula is actually the same one used to find an area. When you multiply, you get a larger result. (8 slices * 4 slices = 32 slices)\n\nFrom here, we should find the common multiplier, which will be used for the problem to eliminate choices. To find it, we have to take the least common multiple of the whole numbers (4 and 8). But when the two numbers are divisible by 4, then just take the lowest of the two: 8, which we will call the multiplier. \nFrom here, we just need to plug these values into the original formula, which will reveal an answer. \n\nOur answer needs to be an integer because the only variables we have are whole numbers in this problem and we had no fractional amount left (no remainder), even though we did have two denominator.\n\nThe answer in D, is the least common multiple (8) of two whole numbers (4 and eight) which is what we were looking for the entire time. \n\n(16 slices of bread / 4) (6 slices of bread) \n(16 *", "answer": " 4"}

Choices:a: personal taste b: the number of guests c: appetite d: amount of money everyone has e: the number of pieces pizza can feed a: personal taste b: number of guests c: amount of money everyone d: appetite e: number of pieces\nRationales:1. The options describe the criteria by which different people in the group arrive at their own portion of pizza.\nThe question is intended to suggest that the decision regarding the splitting of pizzas is subjective, as everyone has their own preferences and criteria.\n2. By discussing personal preferences, the group determines how much pizza each member is willing to share.\n3. The number of people in the group impacts how pizza should be divided among everyone. \n4. With the aim of saving money or ensuring fairness, the group considers how much each person has to spend. \nSince each pizza can be divided into slices, the number of slices per pizza also determines how exactly pizza is shared.\n5. Therefore, \"personal taste\", \"personal taste\", 'amount of money everyone has\", and 'amount of pizza per person' have reasonable potential answers to the question. \nHowever, only \"the number of guests\" does not appear to be an adequate answer. \nThe term 'guest' does not refer to a particular individual in the group, nor can it be defined as an amount of pizza. \n6.

And from the given information, each gallon can fit 10 cups, which means that there are 10 cups/10 gallon.\n4. Now let's find the total number of cups drunk, by subtracting the number of cups left at the party from the total number of cupped/gallon.\n5. Thus, the total number of cupless was 5 cups, which means there were 5 fewer cups/gallon and there were 10 gallons. To eliminate cups left, we add 10 cups left.\n6. Finally, we multiply the total number of cuper drinks by 10 drinks for each galloon.\n7.

Thus, at the time they were married, Anna was 22 years older than Josh.\n\nSo, to get Josh's age now, we substract 25 from 22:\n(5 \u00d7 (22-25)) \u2013 2 = 5 years old.

Choices:  1. Coffe  2. Ice cream  3. Tea  4. I don't know  5. None of the above\nRationales: The given statement is from the beginning of the movie \"What about Bob?\" and the dialogue is part of the narration by a doctor and not the patient. The entire context of the dialogue indicates that the narration is focused on the likes and dislikes of the patient. Hence, none is the correct choice.\n\n### Answer to above question :\n'other things' is not a specific noun but refers to a plurals of the nouns like 'things'. Therefore, coffee, ice cream, and tea are specific items that fall in the category of 'things' and hence, they can be ruled out as synonyms of other things. Furthermore, none of them are the same term as 'other things' in the context of the question. Hence, we can eliminate all these options.\n\nNow let's find out if coffee is a synonym of 'other things'.\nFrom the context, 'coffee' is a preferred drink in the patient's house.

{"text": "### She wants to send three rebates and she can do that with four stamps: 1 x 3 = 3 plus 3 x 2 = 6. That leaves 2 stamps to put on her bills. As she wants to send 3 more mail-in rebate than she does bills, she will have 1 left to go on the electric bill.\n\n### So, she needs 10 stamps altogether.\n### Answer: She needs 10 sticks altogether because she will use 1 stamps for every bills so the count will be the same with stamps for every billing. And then she will use 2 stamps for the electric bill which is 10 minus 10 which is 10 total stamp. Therefore, the answer to this question is: She needs 1 stamps for 1 bill.\n\n## Rationale\n1. A rosebush, squirl are plants and animals so I choose nature, b cause I understand that \"nature\" includes all the plants and animals.\n\n2. Valerie wants to do something with the birthday presents that she receive each year from her grandmother, uncles and aunt. Since she is putting stamps on every envelope, I think she is sending them to her grandmother. She has more envelopes because she's sending 3x rebates that are each 2 stamps to pay the electric bill. She can send 3 more stamps on rebates than bills. \n\n## Explanation\nThe answer to the second quesion is nature.\nThe answer to the third quesion is 10 stamps.\nThe answer to fifth quesion is 3. Since she has 4 stamps she can send each birthday presents and she has 1 stamps left to send 3 rebates, and she does her billing with 4.

{"text": "There are 60% employees who drive to work and 40% of employees who don&#39;t drive to work. Since the number of employees who drive to work is greater than the number of employees who do not drive to work, then 60% of the 140% employees drive to work than those who do not.\n\n### Analysis \n1.  The company had 200 employees and 140% are either drive or don&#39;tdrive.\n2.  Since the number of employees are over 40% then that means the 60% who had driven to work over the 40% who don&#39;;t drive to work.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n### 1. How many more employees drove than the employees who took public transportation?\n1.  We know that 60% of employees drove to work.\n2.  It is also known that 50% of employees who didn&#39;tdrive took public transportation.\n\n### 2. Since the number of people who drove to works is greater than the number who do not take public transportation, then how many people drove to work over the number who do not?\n1. The number who didn&#39;;t drove are 50% of the whole employees.\n2. Therefore the number who drove to work is greater by 10%.\n\n### 3. Let&#39;;s plug in the numbers\n1.

Therefore this means that 60% are equal to 120 people.\n5. 40% are equal to (and equal 80), since the total is 200.  \nThus, there are 60 people who drove, and only 40 people who are taking public transportation.\n60people drive to work &gt; 40take public transportation...  60 - 40 = 20... this means that 20 people who drive to work over those who take public transportation.", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": "Their fourth child was 14 years old.\n\n### Rationale:Let X years old be the child.\n1. Their first child was born exactly 15 years go, so the year before it was born and the year after it was born was 14 years, and exactly one year after it was born and twenty years after it was born was also 14 years.\nThe year before the second child was born and the year it was born and twenty one years after it was born also it was 14 years. So, the year after it was 15 years.  The third child was born when the second child's age was 15. The year after the third child was born and the second child's twentieth birthday was 14 years from birth, which was 16 years ago. After that, he gave birth to the fourth child when the second birthday 14 years in the past was 16 years, 3 years.  The last year after the fourth child gave birth was 17 years old, which was 8 years ago, so there was a total of 25 years from the beginning to the last year.  So the year before its birth was 0, the year it was born was 9, the year after it became 1 was 10 so on the 14th birthday it was 14. Finally, since the fourth child's birthday and its mother's 11th birthday fell on the same day, it was the day of its mother's birth.  So its birthday is 14 years ago, and now the time is 17 years.  Then 17 years ago was 14 years earlier, 14 years ago was 3 years ago and 14 years ago is 0 years older.  So the fifth child is 14 years old now.

{"text": "Jake: $0\n\n### Input(Followup) :You are an experienced and knowledgable mathematician. When I call you a math guru, you don't take offense...because I've been doing it incorrectly all along.\n\n### Rationales:\nHere, you need to understand that the word \"follow-up\" means after something. Here it should be read as 'after the above input'. The word \"guru\" in this context can be substituted with \"expert\" or \"specialist\". This task here tests your understanding of the context of the word.\n\nIn the first task input, you have to be very careful about the answer. In the first task, the question was about the scientist after analyzing the data and not a scientist. So, you need to choose a correct option which is a scientist after analyzing. \"Enlightened\" sounds like a reasonable answer for a scientist, but it should be an adjective, and it has the \"en\" in the beginning. When you say \"an enlighten scientist\", it sounds like \"a scientist who has enlightenment\", but it is not supposed to be so.\n\nThe most important note is that there is a \"has\" in the word \"enlightened\". So, if we choose \"enlightened\", we have to choose \"has\" for the pronoun which we are using in the blank. But, as a rule of the thumb, \"Enlightenment\" doesn't follow the rule.\n\nThe second question is about a rosebush and other animals. In this task, it is obvious that nature is the category which all these objects fall. To test if you understand the context of a word, it is important to consider the word's definition. Look at the meaning of the word \"category\": A group or class that has the same common characteristics and is sometimes classified or defined by those similarities. In the context of the second question example, the category is \"Nature\", which includes all the plants, animals and things which can be found in nature.\n\n### Input (1):Jake has $5,000.

The difference is due to the fact that we subtracted the bag weighing 6 kilos which means the other side now has a weight of 9 kilos. However, after the tear, the side with 6 kilos had lost a bit of weight, thus, making that side lighter than the other side. The first answer is A.\n\n- C: 0 kilos. (After the tear, the bag on the left weighs 6 kilos. Therefore, at this time and space, the empty bag on the left weighed 9 kilos, and the one on the right 6.

{"text": "25 minutes\n\n### Rationale:Running 10 kilometers (6.2 miles, 26.21875 miles or 27.34 mile) takes one hour if you have an average speed of 6.2 miles/hour. Half of 10 is 5 if it\u2019s in hour and in kilometres 5 kilometer = 3.1 miles. So, 30/2 = running at 10 minute per kilometre. 20/1 = running at 20 minute per kilometre and 30/2= running at 25 minute per kilometre. So, his speed is 25 minutes per mile.\n###\nInput:The statement below presents a situation involving a teacher-student dynamic. If a student receives a lesson from an educator and cannot master the skill that was taught, what is the proper way to respond to the educator? Choices:  \u2022 A:  Be rude about it. \u2022 B:  Demand a refund. \u2022 C:  Be humble and apologetic. \u2022 D:  Be defensive. \u2022 E:  Be demanding.\nRationales:1.The above situation involves a student not understanding or mastering a task that an educator teaches them.\n2.Options A and D are extreme statements that are not relevant to the situation described in the question.\n3.Options B and C represent a variety of responses that a student could have when they have not fully grasped a lesson taught by an educator.\n4.Option E does not relate to the scenario described in the passage and is instead a statement emphasizing conflict, possibly with an educator.\n5.Thus, option B is the most logical choice for a response in the given situation because it shows that the student recognizes the educator's effort and is willing to receive future lessons from the educator.\n6.Option B states, \"if a student receives a less and cannot master the skill, what is the proper response to the educator?\" If \"the educator\" is a teacher, then B will be a right option here: because this is how an ideal student should respond to a teacher.\n7.Hence, B is the answer. It is the best response to the teacher who has exerted considerable effort to help a student comprehend a lesson.\nAnswer: B", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "Suraya picked 17 apples more than Kayla.\nBased on the statements:\nCaleb picked 5 more than Kayla. So his final pick was 5.\nKayla picked 20 more than Caleb. So her final pick was 20.\nSuraya picked 8 more than Caleb and 17 more than Kayla. her final pick was 17+8 = 25.\n\n### Difference between this task and the previous one:\nIn this task, a number of extra steps are required.\n- First we need to add up Kayla's two picks: adding 20 and 5 we get 25. \n- Then we subtract Suraya's two picks from Kayla to obtain her final pick:\nsubtract 25 from 25 and we get 0 (because we are subtracting the same number of apples from the same number of appples)\n- Suraya's extra picks (8) is the same as Kayla's original picks (20). Hence, 8 is subtracted from Kayla's final pick of 8, which results in 0.\n- So, according to statements, if Kayla picked 25 apples, Suraya picked 25 appples more than her.\n\n### Tips:\n1.

{"text": "In total, it will take 60 (+2x30+(15-15)) * 2.\n### Explanation:If the towels take twice the time to wash, add 120 to the 30 because 2 times 30 is 60. The final amount of time to wash would be 30 + 2(60) = 60 + 120 = 180 minutes (or 3 hours). However, the towels were not washed for thirty minutes, but for twice that amount of minutes, which would be 60 minutes (or 1 hour). So you have to subtract 60 from the final amount of time to have 120 total minutes. So the sheet wasted 90 of those 120. So, the final amount of minutes it will take to wash everything is 60 + 90 + 30, which is 80 minutes.\n### Instructions:Freddy was on the way to the game. He went by a bus but his bus did not stop at the game. It stopped at two more places and went to the game. His bus took him to a place whose name Freddy did not recognize. It had houses with red roofs, green fences, and yellow doors. The stop before Freddy got on was one stop after the next to last one. Freddy could not remember whether the bus was heading away from or towards the game when it left the last stop before his.

{"text": "If the current harvest rate stays the same, the farmer should have 1,000 bales left as of the end of September. To solve it, we assume that the farmer has two months of supply left over the end of September and start counting the days in each month.

Choice B: 31 days\n3. Choice C: 32 days\n4. Choice D: 35 days\n5. Choice E: 36 days\n\n### Input option explanation:\n\n1. The current harvest rate stays constant throughout the year, so adding that many acres of grass with those many horses would have increased the monthly harvest by 70 bales, 70 x 5 = 350, so 560 + 350 = 910.\n2. We could do this in one month if the horses do not eat any grass during that time, but let's be practical, 1610/30 = 57, and that is about right.

{"text": "Kevin pays $\\$145$.\n\n### Rationale: 1. Given the information in the question, it is clear that T shirts are sold 2 each at $8 dollars. \n2. After calculating the price for various items, it is evident that the total amount of an individual item is equal to the sum of its cost per unit and sales tax:\n\na. T-shirts ($2$ each) = $2$ units * $8$ dollars + (2$ units * \\$. 05$) = $16$.\n\nb. Sweaters ($18$) = $4$ units * $18$ dollars + (0$ units * \\%. 05$)  = $72$.\n\nc. Jackets ($80$)  = $5$ units * $80$ dollars + (0 units * $\\%. 05$ dollars) = $80$\n\nConsequently, the total price of all the items = $16$ dollars + $72$ dollars + $80$ dollars = $\\$162$.\n\nNextly, when calculating Kevin's total payment, the sale price (10 percent discount) of the jacket reduces the overall bill by $\\$5$.

This would equate to $1500 more per year, which has been automatically withdrawn from his savings by the bank on the last day of each month. From which of the following accounts will Roberto's new yearly income be charged?\n\n### Option A: Personal checking B: Savings C: Debit Card D: Loan E: Credit Card\n\n### Choice A: Personal checking means this account is not used anymore, that will mean the account is deleted, no new yearly income will be charged from this account. So choice A is incorrect.\n\n### Choices B to E all contain bank accounts, those are the accounts that will be charged for the new yearly income. So all options except A are valid possibilities.\n\n### Option D: Loan is not a valid option, since the withdrawal is for a period of 365 days, not necessarily a loan. Choice B: Savings holds more possibility since the previous answer was to his \"Savings\" account.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nDuring the time frame of one year Roberto's debit card will have a maximum of 12 withdrawals. This is because one debit card can be withdrawn up to 12 times before a new debit card has to be issued. After the account gets overdrawn or goes into the red there will be a fee that will be taken out. We also do not know which account or bank is Roberto's debit or credit card holder with.\n\n### We also need to consider what would happen if the debit or credit account is over 12 times. If this takes place the bank will take out a $30 fee for each time the card is re-issued for that customer.

{"text": "To solve the puzzle, we need to calculate Jessica's money and then compare it to Rodney's money, which will help us discover whether Jessica has more than Rodney.\n1. We will first find out how many dollars Jessica has by adding the money in her account with 100 dollars. This means we are looking for \"100\" + \"half\" of \"50.\"\n2. So we need to find 100 plus 50/2, which equals 150. The answer to the first puzzle is 150 dollars.\n3. This means that Jessica has 150 dollars in her wallet.\n4. Now we will take the money that Rodney has and add it to Jessica's. This equals 35 plus 150, which is 185 dollars\n5. The amount that Rodney has is the answer to the second puzzle.\n6. We subtract the two figures, Jessica's and Rodney's. Jessica's money is 150, while Rodney's money is 35.\n7. By subtraction, we have 150 - 35, which equals 115.\n8. Jessica has 115 dollars in her wallet, and Rodney has 35.\n9. Lastly, we will calculate the difference between the two sums. To do this, we subtract Rodney's money from Jessica's. We get 115 - 35, resulting in 80 dollars as the final answer.\nAnswer:80 dollars\n\n### Input The teacher has three candy and 4 toys for the kids.

{"text": "#### Step 1:\n#### Step 2:\n#### Step 3:\nThe answer is E.\n\n### Explanation:\nInput:John pays for half of the cost of raising a kid.\n\nStep 1: Since John is paying for half of the total cost of raising a child, he pays [half/2 \u2217 (10000+10000)*8+2*(250000)] each year.\n\nStep 2: Write this expression in the form x + y.\nStep 3: Now convert this form in the form of x \u00d7 xy + y.\nStep x \u2248  5000  +  500000, y \u2248  25000\nThe answer is E    The solution is: The answer is 550000.\n\n### Rationales:\nInput:John pay for half of the cost to raise a child.\n\n1. The word pay used is the verb form of pay. So, the noun is pay or pay. In this form, John pays for half of the total child care costs each year. \n2. Now we are going to find the exact cost by multiplying it by 8 and 2 which are the years the cost is paid until the child turns 18.\n\nStep 3: So, the cost for year 1 to 8 is [{(5000 + 50000) * 8} + 2 * (25000)] which is 550,008. \n3. For 9 to 18, the cost is [{(50,004 + 50,00,000) * (8 + 2)}] which is $2,648,416 \n4. So, the total cost of raising the child is $2648,444. \n\n### Input for the next problem: What is another name for the answer to this problem?\n\n### Solution:\nLet us understand the question first.

{"text": "It'll take 14 * 3 = 42 minutes\n\n### Explanation: First step, Tina times how long it takes to clean one key: 3 minutes. If she had only 3 keys to clean, all of them would be done at the same time. It takes 3 full minutes to clean and dry one key, and she will still have one more key to clean.\n\n### Second step, time how long it takes her to do all the keys on her laptop: She has 15 keys to clean, and it takes 3 minutes for one key to be cleaned and dry. So it will take 3 minutes for one, but she has 15 keys, so it will take 15 minutes to have all of her keys clean and dry.\n\n### Third step, it takes 10 minutes to finish her assignment. So, when Tina is done she has 5 minutes and 45 seconds before the food will be done.\n\n### Fourth step, Tina figures out that when she has 42 minutes to finish both her keyboard and assignment, but she's only going to have 5 minutes and 35 seconds. So, if it takes 42 minutes to do her keyboard, she'll use up all of her time\n\n### Fifth step, The assignment is going to be complete in 10 minutes. That leaves Tina 5 minutes and 15 seconds to clean her keyboard. She decides to finish her assignment because the time limit has passed.\n\n### Rationales: Here are the things to do:\n- First step, Tina has been given the time it'll take to clean one of her laptop keys on her laptop, which is 3 minutes. She still has one more key to clean to finish the job.\n- Second step, Tina knows it'll take 15 minutes for her to clean all the keys on her keyboard, but she has 35 seconds before her dinner is done, so she needs to hurry to finish her assignment.\n- Third step, Tina has just enough time to finish both her assignment and clean her keyboard after the time is done.

How can I do this?\n\nA: ask someone who has been there before\nB: Use Map\nC: Use GPS\nD: Use Compass\nE: Use Google\n\n### Response\n\nA: Asking someone who has been there or having that person as a guide is always an option. But, you can achieve this step using the following: \n\n1. Use map.\nMap is a drawing of the shape of land, showing countries, cities, and natural features. It indicates roads, railroads, rivers, and land masses. A map gives information about land features, travel routes, and political boundaries. The shortest distance from A to B is not always the same as the route that you choose. The route also depends on the roads or highways available in the area or the area of preference.\n\n2. Use GPS and Google. \nGPS: Global Positioning System is a system of many satellites, each located in a different orbit, that relay signals to earth. GPS is a great tool, but it can sometimes be a little off. You can use it to determine the shortest distance or route.\n\n3. Use Compass. \nThe compass is a helpful tool for determining the shortest route. Know the direction of North and South from where you are. If you are traveling a distance that is not straight, mark the direction of where you want to end. It will be easier to find landmarks and other things to keep you on track.\n\n### Input\n\n### Why does the water in the bottom of a bath tub sink\n\n### Answer\n\nBecause of the density, water always tends to sink.

{"text": "### In this question, a variable, $D$, is defined and then used in each step of the calculation.\n### Calculate how much the final answer $A$ will change if the variable $D$ changes by $20$.\n### You can do this calculation as many times as needed.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. First let\u2019s consider the first statement, \u201dwell-cared fish can last 2 years longer than how long dogs can survive.\u201d The expression is 2*n (where n is the number of years that dogs can live). Since dogs can live about 4 years, they can live 2*n times longer. n = 4, so 2*4 = 8 years\n2. Now let\u2019s consider the second statement, \u201don average, dogs can live 4 times as many years than hamsters can survive.\u201d The second expression is 4n (where n is again the number of years that hamsters can live, but this time we are talking about how many times they can live as compared to how long dogs can live.) Since hamsters can live about 2.5 years, how many times are they likely to live? n = 2.5, so 4*4=16 years\n3. Next, let\u2019s consider the third expression. We know that the hamsters can live an average of 5 years. To find the number of years, multiply both the expressions: 4 * 5 = 20 years\n4. Finally, we consider the fourth expression. We know that fish can live an average of about 6 years. We can write this using the second statement: 4 * 6 = 24 years\n5. Thus, the sum of all the expressions is 2(8)+16+20+24 = about 78 years. If $D$ changes by 20, then the final answer $A=82$ instead of 78. \n6. Let\u2019s try the step 5 another time: if $D$ changes by -20, then the sum will become about 68 instead of 78\n7. Calculate how much the answer will change if $D$ changes from -20 to -8.\n8. The first step involves moving $D$ 8 in the negative direction. That is, 8 -20", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "I'm not sure how to use a percentage. Could you give me additional instruction?\n\n### Demystification\n\n**Rationale:** The student is confused about how to apply the formula. This is a common mistake among students from all age groups to use percentages or fractions as if they are the same. In mathematics, the rules for using percentages differ from those used to solve problems with whole numbers. This is also why in higher levels of mathematics, the word \u201cpercents\u201d is often replaced with the word \u201cpercent\u201d to make it clear that a percentage has been used in the question. This is to prevent students from accidentally using fractions to solve percent questions.\n\n**Response:**\n1. Explain what a percent is: the first thing to say is that a percentage is a way of expressing a \u201cmixed fraction,\u201d a representation of a fraction as a whole number followed by a whole number with a denominator of 100. The percentage is the whole number part of the fraction. \n2. To find the percentage that one number, called the Numerator (also called the top number) represents of another number, called the Denominator (also called the bottom number) multiply the numerator by the 100 and divide by the denominator.  45 / 100 = 0.40 = 40%.\nThe 40% tells us that twenty white socks cost 50 cents each. This may seem odd, because isn\u2019t 40% $0.40?, but when you are dealing with mixed numbers, the answer is always a \u201cmixed number,\" or a fraction. To add the percent to the price, we simply add 50 cents to the final price. \n3. Here is one more example. 40% of 15 brown sock is another way of writing 15 brown sockets cost $0.60.", "answer": " 3"}

Choices:  S: Wood chisels T: Carving knives U: Adjustable plier V: Tape Y: Nail\nRationales: Given the context of a carpenter building a structure, the answer should be an object used to build/construct something.\nChoice S, which is Wood chisels, is a tool for working on wooden crafts. While it may be used at some point in the process of construction, wood chisels would not be used in a major role in building a structure like a carpenter's main tools.\nOption U, which is Adjustable plier, may be used in construction for tightening or installing various parts. However, it is not as significant as a tool for building as the use of carving knives T, tape Y, or any other tool that cut, nail, or paste.\nTherefore, the right answer is V, Tape.

{"text": "$3.15\n\n**Demonstration**\n1. **Solution** You need to remember the following:\n2. **What you are being asked to do** is to find the total amount of money to pay for the food.\n3. **How the information is presented**: Susan has her recipe that requires 2 servings per batch and each serving requires 1 potato and 1 teasoon of salt. This means she is making 2 * 2 = 4 batches of the recipe. Each batch requires 4 * 1 potato and one teasoon of salt = 4 * (1 potato + 1 teasoon = 5 teaspoon). Since each batch makes 2 servings, that would be 4 * 2 = 8 servings. Since a potato costs $0.10, that would be 8 * $0.10 = $0.80 for potatoes. Since a container of salt costs 5 teaspooon per container, that would be 5 * $2 = $10 for salt.\n4. **Information needed** Since each batch of the recipe makes 2 servings. You need to know the total number of servings.

The only answer that could fit is 55 because it rounds up to 0 which is true.

Start with an \u200b8\u200b, add 6 and you will have the 7th grade, multiply by 60 and you will have the money in 9th grade.\n\n### Exlpanation:\nWe know $900 is where the answer is. That means we need to know what's in the 61st spot. To know what is in the 61th spot, we need to know the 61th digit in sequence. 900 is in the thousand place. When we move to the thousandth place, we know that the 18 is in the 60th spot, so we know that the 61st digit is 6. Then, we multiply the 8 by the 60, which is 480. We know the money is in the 9th. We know since money and the 8 multiplied by 60 gives 480, multiply 480 by 60 and our answer is $29,600.\n\n### Input:(23) + 21 + 35 + (29) + 49 + (7) =?\nWe will solve this equation: (23)+21+3", "answer": " 23"}

The question asks about the time it took for Dave and Jenna to complete their tasks, either building or cleaning the set. The options given are all options in time intervals, with the first option being half an hour, second option - 20 minutes, third option - 15 minutes, and fourth option - 1/4 hour.\nThe first option, half an hour, is the longest interval of time, as it includes 30 minutes, which is the maximum amount of time the two could've spent on either building or cleaning. Similarly, the third option, 15 minutes, also includes 15 minutes of time, which indicates that the amount of time spent on either task can be a maximum of 15 minutes\nFrom these options, we can eliminate 20 minutes (20 minute interval not including the entire amount of time required) and 1/4 hours (1/4 hour interval indicating that the entire time required for the task was not included).\nSince we have identified 20 minutes and 1/2 an hour as not valid options, the only two valid options left are 1/2 hour (half an hour interval not including the entire time required for task) and 1/2 hour more (1/2 hour interval, indicating that the entire time\nrequired for the task was included in the options). \nIn terms of time interval, 1/2 hour and 1/2 hours are the only valid options, as 1/2 hour is the maximum amount of total time required to complete building or cleaning the room.

But it is also stated in the question that the number must be at least 24 and no higher than the number of ants that would be able to survive within a 5-hour timeframe (which is 48).

A common misconception is that addition is a \u201csimple\u201d problem, but the above problem is an example of how difficult addition can be when the addition problem is represented as a mathematical formula.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n\\$50 \\times \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2\\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^2 \\approx \\frac{50\\cdot 3^2}{2\\cdot 2} \\approx 275\\$\n\nAnswer: 275 kg\n\n### Input\n\n\\$The fishmonger sold a total of \\$$\\frac{2}{3}\\$kg of salmon this week.\\$\n\n\\$The amount of salmon he sold next week is three times more than this week.\\$\n\\$How many kg of salmon did he sell this week?\\$\n\n### Response\n\n\\$\\frac{2^{1/3} \\text{(the amount sold this week)}}{3^{\\frac{2-1}{3}} - 2^{\\frac{1-1}{3}}}\\$\n\nA common method of figuring out the answer to this problem is to take the given numbers and subtract the least from the greatest. For example, the question states that you sold 2/3 kg this week and 3/2 times more this week. Since 3/2 is larger than 2/3, we would multiply 2/3 by 3/2 to solve the problem. Then, using fractions, we would find that the total amount of salmon sold (in kg) is 6/12.\n\nSince the answer was given in the question, we may rewrite it as k. In the equation, x is the product of 6/12 and k, and y is the product of 1/2 and 6/12, which gives the equation y = 3/2. Then, solving for x, we get x", "answer": " 200"}

How many extra wings per minute must he eat in order to match Kevin\u2019s record?\nRationale: 1. Firstly, Kevin's record is 64 wings in 8 minutes or 800 wings in a 1 hour duration. \n2. Hence he can eat 12 hot wings in 8minutes or 1200 hot wings in 1h.\n3. Now the problem asks for the number of wings he needs to eat to break the record.\n4. The statement says that Alan's current capacity of 5 wings/minute. \n5. Kevin can eat 8 hot wings in 8 mins or 120 hot wings in 8 hours or 500 hot wings in a day. \n6.

The number of blowfish and clowni fish in the display tank can be described as \"N\"- where N is the total number of fish before they swam in and out of the tanks.\n3. Because, N = (26 + 11 + 10) clown fish, with N as the total number of fish, because the question only references the number of clown fish and not the number of all fish.\n4. Therefore,\n- [26 + 10] + 10 = [26 + 2(N-26) - (N -26)-26]\n5. Substituting for N from the first equation, \n- (26 + 2*N - (26-26)-26)\n6.

{"text": "Anne is 2 times as old as Emille, which means that Emillie is Anne's half age (i.e. half the time that have elapsed).\nSimply put, for Emillie to be 6 times as old as Mauve, Emillie should have had twice as much time to have passed by. Now, since Emilie has taken twice the time than Anne, so it means that Anne has been around for less time than Emillie. Now we all know, if Anne has been around for Less than Emillie, then Anne should be younger than Emillie. Anne should have been born at a time when Emille was 7 half times Emillie's age, if Emillie's had been twice the age, then Anne would have to be born when Emillie was twice it's age, i.e. Emille would be (135/2) years old. But we know Emille is six times as old, and by now Maude is 8, so 8 minus two half's is (6-2)=4, and it means that Emill will be twice the age four times eight, i.e. 8 multiplied by 4 is 32. So now we have Anne who is 2/2 (half of half Anne's age) old which means that when Anne was born, Emillie was (7/2) times Emille's age, which means Emillie was (259/2)=129 years old.\nNow to find out how old was Anne when Maude will be 129th times younger.

Also, Maude who was (64/2)=32 times younger when Anne was born. To find out now Anne's age, we will subtract the age that's in (64/2) (that is, 32 years), from Anne's age.

This would help you in distinguishing the choice that describes the right behavior.\n2. The statement hints that the person would start to do the happy dance if they were to win the lottery.\n3. While \"start to do the happy happy\" dance (choice A) is a potential behavior that a person might have, their actual behavior isn't necessarily related to the act of dancing.

Now we are faced with the question, how many words are in each puzzle, on average. To answer this let us assume that for each day Bert solves the puzzle on the average, he uses 100 words and therefore fills up 100 words out of which 105 pencil will be used.\n5.

Then it says 35% of the students read 2 books and since the total that they should have read is 180 then the total the rest of them are going to read is going to be more than 180. So 6 / 12 of them are going to finish more than one book which is why the answer for the first part is 1/2 of the number of students who finish 3 or more books.\n\nNext we have to multiply the first part by 5/12 and divide that by 7/12 which is less than the half of the second part which is 2,200 / 7,200, so the remainder is -220.\n\nSo the second part is the number of students who don't finish anything and the number of students who finished less than 3 books.\n\nSo our final answer is going to have a little bit of trickiness and some more steps because in order to solve the second part we need the second part to equal out the answers for both parts.\n\nSo it comes to 2,000 / 7/12 and we add a zero for the 2 because 6/12 doesn't actually include 6, so that would be 2,001 and now this equals 730 and we know that since it says 1/6 of the other part was three or more books that 730 +1/6 of 600 is going to be less than 600.

There were 22 people who only took wine and 12 who only took soda.\n\n### Rationale:\nThese are the steps to solving this question. First, figure out the number of people who only have one drink. Therefore, 22 must have drunk wine and 12 must have drunk soda. If we subtract 22 and 12 from the total count of 75 we get 29, which indicates that the total people who did not take any drink was 29.\n\nIf a person took one drink, and a person took two drinks, the person who took one drink would not have it. For the same reason, those who took two drinks didn't have any left.\n\n### Example:\n```\ninput:\n        At a gathering, it is noted that 55 people took neither wine nor soda, 49 people took only wine, and 37 people took only soda.

This is incorrect, because the original question does not mention a final result. It merely asks for an answer to the question: \"How many pounds of strawberries did each person pick?\"\n\n### Response\nIn order to answer the question, one needs to have the amount that each person paid.

{"text": "The requested response is: (4x15)+2(14x2)(answer is: 96)\n\n### Rationale:\nIf you know the amount of rainfall per day, calculate with addition (it is more simple then):\n\n4x15 + (14x2) = 60 + 28 = 88\n(answer)\n\n### Answer:\n88 inches\n\n### Rationales:\nThe question can be transformed into: the question has three blocks, where each block comprised 7 days. We need to convert each block of 7 days into inches so that it will be easier to calculate. Firstly if we know how much rain was in 7 days, multiply it to 7 and we will get the amount of rain in 49 days.\nNext, we can calculate the average rainfall during each block of seven days (it is easier if you use a block as in my response with the block of 15 days). So we add the number of days in each block(2) and then divide it with the amount of water from that block (49 in total). 2/49 = 0.0411 which equals to the answer 0.04.\nWe multiply the amount of water(0.04) by two (2x0.04 = 0.08) to compensate the new amount of rain in 7 days after the first block (it is more clear if you look at my explanation in the original script). Therefore: 0.04+0.08 =0.12 which equals to the answer. 0.12 + 2x0.08= 1.44 which equals to 1.44. 0.144 - 14x0.08 = 0.8496 which equals to the answer of 84.96.\nThe original script was: \nThis month, it rained an average of 7 inches every 7 days. What is the total amount in inches?\n\nIn the beginning we multiply the amount of inch per day * 7 (0,07*7) which will give us a total of 4.9 inch per seven days.\nSecond step, we add the amount of week to the 4,9", "answer": " 180"}

{"text": "The group of spiders would have 64 total legs if each group of spiders has fewer than 56 legs.\n\n### Reasons:\n1. The question is asking about the total number of legs in a group of spiders.\n2. Assuming that a group of spiders is represented by a number written numerically, such as 45, \"a group of spiders\" can only contain a certain number of spiders, each of which has eight legs.\n3. If each member of a group of eight-legged spiders has 16 legs, the group would have a total of 64 legs.\n4. However, if each member of the group had fewer legs, the total number of legs would be less than 56.\n5. This is because all the spiders in this group of spider must have fewer than half as many legs than a single spider would have.\n6. Hence, if each group of spider has fewer than 59 legs, the total number the group's legs would be 64.\nAnswer: 64 legs\n\n### Input :What is the name of the device shown?\n\n### Rationales:\n1.

{"text": "In her last grocery bill, Jennifer spent $2.50 for twelve apples, $.40 for one pear, and $.20 for three oranges.\n\n### Solution:\nThere's a total of 60 fruits.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe amount of one type of food does not have to be identical for that food to be the same amount. For example, apples, oranges, and apples are all examples of fruits. \n\nThe amount of each of these foods in Jennifer's store does not have to add up to 60.\n\nIt is given that Jennifer has a total of ten apples, twenty oranges, and twice more apples than pears.\n\nTwice more apples than pear means Jenifer has twice 10 but half 20, which is 10. This means there are ten pears.\n\nIf Jennifer gives her sister 2 apples, 3 oranges, and 2 pears, she will not have a total of 62 fruits. \n(2+3+2)=7 apples, 4+6=10 oranges, 10+2=12 apples. So the last equation is (2*12)+(0.5*20)+(.4*10) = +2 oranges, 3 pears. Since 2 is 60% of 10 and 3 is 60% 20, she would have a total of 58 fruits after the exchange.\n\nLet's assume there to be 60 total, there will be (12+3+2)(.4+0.5+2) = 64.33. Since (1/64.33)(1-.4)(3-.5)=0.285, there's another fruit missing, because 0.285 of 60 is 16/32 fruits and 60 is even. So there would be 64, 2 will be apples, 4 will be oranges, 2 will be pears, and the other will be unidentified.\n\nOne fruit in twelve dollars is 1, sixteen dollars of it would be 3, three dollars of it would", "answer": " 44"}

If we break down the numbers, we can see that Roger rode his bi-cycle for 2 miles in the morning, and 5 times this amount in the evening.  \n\nWe must multiply the answer we got from the morning ride time by 5 because we multiply the first number each time.\n\nThe answer we get is A.\n\n### Input\nHard work always pays off. How many hours of studies should someone put in every night to have good grades in a month?\n\n### Demonsration\n\nIf X hours equate to half of the whole value required, then 1/2(X) hours equal to 0.5 X hours. \nSince we don\u2019t know the whole value, let us assume the whole value to be 10 hours. \nTherefore, X minutes = 10 hours/24 hours = 0.41666666 \u2026 (hours)\n\nSo, X hours = 4.16666 (hours).\nThe person should study for 4.16 hours every night to get good grades in a given month.\n\n### Answer\nB.\n\n### Proof\nWe use indirect mathematical computation to prove each case.\n\n### Step 1: Assuming our person studies 6 hours every night, they will achieve a score of 95%, or 0.95. \n\nWhen we study for 6 hours each day, we will be good enough to get a score of 96%.  Whenever you multiply anything by 1/3, the value will end up losing its decimal value. \n\nThis is simply because when you multiply a whole number with any fractional number, you will always get a decimal value, and as a rule, your decimal value will never be more than 4 places. \n\n```\n(6 \\* 1/4)^2 = 96 \\*\\(\\text{4/4}$\\)^2 = 96\n```\n\nThis is why you will always be getting 100% results as you multiply a whole number by every fraction you apply, and the answer will never be more than a 4-decimal place.", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "25\n\n### Demostration:\n1. Assume that in each plant, the ratio exists among the number of tomatoes per plant,\n\nThe 7/18 part has the same ratio as the remaining part of tomatoes.\n\n2. Now for Andy to have 25 tomato, 7/18 must be multiplied by 2, but for drying half, 7/12 must be multiplied by half then also by two. Similarly same for turning marinara sauce. So the final number of tomato is 25.\n\nRationales: The rationale is to divide the part that is taken by Andy.\n3. First, we calculate the value of tomato in each plant. We multiply the number of tomato per plant by the total number of plant. Then, we divide each plant with the whole value of plant. This gives us the percentage value (of tomato) taken by Andy.\n\n4. To calculate the value of the tomato left for Andy, we will divide the total tomato with the percentage value of tomato taken by Andy. This would give 50% (7/18).\n\n5. We take the multiplier of 50% that is half, then take 7 tomatoes, and finally multiply it. However, the multiplier of 30% to 7 tomatoes doesn't take 7 because the remainder 7, 0, is not divisible by 30%. So, 30% \u2248 0.2307\n\nIn the example, the tomato is being divided into the two categories: drying half and turning marinara sauces of 35%.\n6.

Because Andy have 25 tomatoes to begin with.\n8. We then calculate the tomato Andy will have left, not including the 14.325 he needs to cook as in the example.\n9.

Michelle drove 2000/12 = 166.66 miles because 2000 = 1666.66 rounded to the nearest integer.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe only way to approach this problem is through the distributive property. Distributive property tells us that when numbers are multiplied by a sum, we can separate the sum from the product. That allows us to cancel, making computation easier.

{"text": "18\n\n### Rationale:\nThe correct way to write this response would be to subtract 8 from 7 (to obtain the correct shoe size for Alexa) and then add the shoe size for Jasmine to the number obtained by subtracting 8 from her shoe size (as Jasmine's size is the number obtained from subtracting 8 from Alexa's size), which comes out to 18 (as 6+7=13, and 13+7=20, which then becomes 18 if we add 8 to the number obtained by adding 6 to 7, which is 7).\n\nAnother correct way to write this answer would be (subtracting 8 from Jasmine's number first). So you take the 7 and subtract 8. Then you take the number 6 and subtotal that. Then you add that plus the number you obtained by subtracting 6 from 7. Then you add 8 to the answer you just obtained. So 8+8=16. Then you sum it with the Jasmine size.\n\nIt would also be valid to do this: Add 8 to Jasmine size. Subtract 8 from Alexa size. Subtract the two numbers.

Based on the information given in the question, each apartment can accommodate up to four residents at maximum. 3. Given the assumption that the residents in a flat can accommodate two to four individuals, the maximum total number of residents that can be living in the block of flights is thus calculated as follows.

{"text": "The rectagle has an area of 15 square inches.\n\n### ResponseRationale: \nThe area of a rectangle is 4 inches x 4 inches = 16 square inches. Since the perimeter of the rectangle is 30, then the rectangle's length and width are 5 and 3 respectively. We can subtract the perimetre (30) from the area of the rectangle (16) to find that the length minus the width of the rectangle is 10. Taking square root of both sides and subtracting 4 gives us that the length of the rectangle is 6. Hence, the width of the rectangle will be 7 with an area of 12 square inches. Subtracting the perimetre of the rectangle (30) from 16, that is 5 and 11 inches respectively, we're left with the difference of 8. Subtracting that difference 8 (answer option B) from 16 (area), we're left with 8 (length), which we just found out is the width of our rectangle. Hence, the formula we obtained was length + width = perimetre.\n\n#### Input:The first four letters of the word \"UNIVERSITY\" are \"UNI.\" If that abbreviation were used alone, it would mean what?\n\n#### Response: A school\n\n#### ResponseRationale: 1.

In case the solution seems to be too easy, answer E is the only wrong answer among all the options.\n6. In the word 'University', the letter S is the fourth from the end. The letter S in the word'school' comes two letters before the last letter 'L'.\n7.

(Because the sentence says that)\n\nThis also means that Jenny ate at least 75 chocolate bars. (Because 75 is more than 3 times of 25)\n\nAnother known information is that Mike ate 75 chocolates.\n\nWe also already have the equation : 75+5= 80.\n\nThis tells us that Mike ate 80 chocolate squares. (because 80= 75+5)\n\nThis means that Mike ate thrice the amount of Jenny.\n\nIf Mike ate 85 chocolate squares, Jenny ate 255. If Michael ate 86 chocolate squares, Jener eats 262.\n\nFrom their statements Mike says Jenny ate 1.13 times (85: 255) more chocolate squares than him. Jenny said she ate 1.03 times (86:262) more chocolate bars than him.\n\nHowever, according to the original statement : Jenny has a tummyache and Mike says his sister ate more than three times the number of chocolates he ate.\n\nTheir statements imply that Jenny eats.9 more than triple the number he ate.\nSo, we write a mathematical equation : \n\n(75+5)= 3.3\n\n( 85+5)= 4\n\nThe statement also said Jenny ate more then thrice the number of Mike ate.

Gillian spent three times more than Sandi's total but $100 less than Gillian. What is the total cost of items at a farmer\u2019 market?\n3. Rationales: 1) Start with the first piece of information, Sandi had $610. She spent half on farmers market that equals $305. Next, Gillian spent twice as much on farmers market as Sandi, which equals $610. $610 is twice as much as 305 and so $915 is what Gillian spent on the farmers market. However, that is not enough to answer the whole question. We need to use the second piece of information, Gillian spent three times as much as Sandi's total amount (305) but $100 les, which makes $915 the answer. 2) The equation is 610= 1.5X 625 but it is not equal to 915, so $915 $915 is the correct answer for the question. 3) For the explanation part, we can use equation 610 = 2X 410, which equals $1220. To make the second piece of information in the question to be equal, we use $610=3X 625, which equals 915.

Choices:  C: Bicycle A: B: Boat E: D: Train\nRationales: The question asks about the type of transportation option available to someone who drives a Prius.\n1. Since Priuses are known to run on gasoline, options A, B, E and D are eliminated because they don't fit with the statement's facts.\n2. Option C, bicycle, could be one option available to someone who owns a Prius, as it can save fuel and could potentially reduce car ownership in the US.\n3. However, the question is specifically asking about another transportation option available to the person, not about the effects of owning a Prius.\n4.

How could the monster swallow 847 people over a span of 300 years?\n1. If we are assuming the monster can eat up to 4,000 men in one year, at the end of the 300th year, there must be a total of 40 ships, with 2 times 2 ships for every year (40 of 2) to a total of 80 ships. 80 ships have 800 men on each ship. This gives a total of 64,000 people. Add this to the original number of people, that is 847 to make a total of 851,400 people. If these number of 851 400 people were on the ship it will mean that the monster can eat one whole ship in one year.\n2.

{"text": "Choose an appropriate option that provides the solution.\n\n### Rationale: There are 3 ways to determine whether or not the time allotted to complete a particular task is sufficient.\n1. The first method is to calculate the remaining amount of time by subtracting the allotted time from the estimated duration of the task.\n2. If the result is within reasonable limits of the estimated task time, then the allotted time is sufficient. Otherwise, it is not.\n3. An example of this would be calculating 20 minutes of allowable time minus the time required to read 12 pages. Since 20 minutes is less than 12 pages, the remaining time is sufficient to read the 12 pages.\n4. Another method is to add the number of remaining pages to the number of pages already read and then divide the sum of the two by the allowed time.\n5. In an example, 20 minutes of allotted time added to the 2 pages already read (10 pages left to be read) divided by 20 (allotted time), gives an estimated 1/3 of the pages remaining to be read. This is further than expected, so it indicates that the allotted time is insufficient because the time allotted is too short.\n6. Another method is to multiply the number of pages per minute by the total number of pages and then divide this result by the number of minutes allotted.\n7. The equation is:\n\nEstimated Reading Time = Number of Pages * Reading Rate * Total Minutes Time Allotted\n\n8. Let's look at an example to understand the math logic behind this method.\n9. Suppose we have a reading time that is 2.7 minutes per page and 100 pages to be read. In this case, we multiply the reading rate by the number of pages, then divide it by the time allotted to get the result as follows: 2.7 (minutes per page) * 100 (pages) = 270 (minutes reading time), then 270 (reading time) / 20 (minutes allotted) = 13.5 (total estimated minutes needed to be reading).\n10. Since 20 (minute allotted) > 13.5 the allotted time is more than the estimated time to be read, the allotted", "answer": " 5"}

The question is whether Gerald can save enough money to buy his baseball supplies in 4 months by doing 400 chores.\n2. The first part of the question sets out the amounts Gerald is working with, including how much he spends on baseball supplies ($100), what his season lasts for ($4 months), and how much he makes in a month ($10).\n3. To solve the question, one must determine how many chores Gerald would need to do in a month to save up enough money for his baseball supplies.\n4. Looking at the available information, it is clear that Gerald spends $11,000 per season, or $100 a week, on baseball supplies, and he is only able to make $10 (100 \u2013 90), or $40 in a month.\n5. Based on the information provided, Gerald would need to make $14 a month ($40-26, after losing $6) in order to save up for the four months, or $56 per month.\n6.

However, these are conditional statements, as they rely on the given circumstances.\n3. For example, B implies only if the previous statement holds.\n4. Thus, \"without a doubt\" (choice E) means it is certain to be the case. The use of \"i doubt so\" (choice D) would contradict the literal meaning of the sentence \"I doubt that is the case.\"\n5. Since the correct option is D: \"i doubt so,\" E: \"without a doubt\" cannot be the correct answer.\n6. Also, B: \"of course,\" and C: \"certainly\" can be eliminated because \"of course\" means the situation is likely to be the same as the original situation and \"certainly\" means the situation described in the first sentence is likely to be the actual condition.\n7.

(7 + 6)\n- Is the sum 13 or 14? (13 if you count every time you are killing a germ)\n- The correct answer is 13 because we only count killing a germ for each time, the time that there are 7 germs after one sanitizer spray, it can be counted again when you use the second sanitizer spray. If you put all the killing germs then, the answer is 14. (13 or 12 germs after the first sanitizer spray)\n- What percent of germs are left? = 13*100/16 (13*10%) divided by 16 to get the decimal. 70/16 which results in 43.75% of germs are left\n\n### How I figured out the answer:\n\n- 50% of 4 germs = 1 remaining germ\n- 25% of 6 germs = 3 remaining germs\n- Total of 5 and 6 are 11\n- After using this two sanitizer sprays together, what is the total of 5 and 3?\n\t- 5+3=8\n- How many germs are left?\n\t- 11-(5+8) = 7 remaining germs\n\n### Additional notes and strategies:\n\nThe sanitizer kills either 50% or 25% of the germ.

The remainder can be either positive or negative. \n\n## Explanation:We have an equation like 34\u00f73 = 11.06 and 7\u00f73 = 2.33.

The sales price was 15% of the regular price.  What was the original price of the item?\n\n## Demos:To solve this question we have two conditions and we are required to find an equation that satisfies both the condition. A: the sales price would have to be 90% of the original or B: the item would have been listed as half off its original price.\n## Solution: Since the sales price is 15% of its original price, the original price will be 165.\n\n## Explanations:First we convert the given to a percentage 8/10 * 5/10 \u2248  4/5 =2/5.Then we need to find a condition to solve for the original price. So we know that the item was on sale but to determine how much it was onsale we need to divide the sales price by regular price and the result = 2/5.\n\n\n### Input  : In 2/3 of an hour, how many whole minutes are in the hour?\n### Demostracion: We are given a question that asks for an outcome.", "answer": " 23"}

The answer provided by (a) is invalid because the question explicitly states that the statements are all true propositions. To negate the given statement, one does not need to provide further \"proof\" that any particular statement is false. Therefore, if the statement \"The cat is on the box\" is indeed true, then the statement \"The table is not on the box\" must also be true.\n\nThe second answer (b) is also invalid because it does not follow from the first two statements. The conclusion - the table is in the dog - is not logically implied by the premises - the dog and the dog are in the cat. Even if \"if P then Q\" were a logical law, it would not apply to this example since we are reasoning from \"the dog is in the cat\" to \"the dog is in another cat\" instead.\n\nAnswer (c) \"The box is not on the table\" is also incorrect because the argument provided does not satisfy the conditions of logical disjunction as stated in (a).

{"text": "When the weights were being lowered, 20% of the weight of the weights was not felt or perceived by Tom.\n\n### Rationale: Answer:\n1. The question is asking about the feel of the weights Tom used when he was going down while using an exercise machine.\n2. Weight is a physical quantity and is measured in units of \"force\". A unit of weight is equal to the force of gravity pulling on a mass of one kilogram.\n3. We can use newtons(N) as measurement of force when describing weight on Earth.\n4. Choices A, B, C and D use a different value of mass to calculate the weight. The actual weight of the weight plates is 15 kg so using 25 kg would be incorrect by a difference of 10 kg. Choice B also uses the value of mass but it uses the value of 707, which is incorrect. It should be 700. Choice D uses incorrect units of measurement. It should be either N or kg.\n5. By using the correct value of mass and unit of measurement, the weight can then be calculated to be 450lbs.\n6. But as the exercise machine is designed to make 20% heaviest of the weight, so it would be 20% of 450lbn = 890 lb.\n7. But when Tom actually went down which amount he would be able to feel.\n8. So, when Tom went down by using this machine he had 890lb which actually was felt as 771 lb that is 770.7 \n9.

The scientist did not care about the choice of substance but wanted to know if the different substances would affect plants in the ways they might be expected to be). C. decide if those two things were harmful to plants. This would be a useful question, but it is not what the scientist was trying to do in the experiment. D. find out if those substances can be good for the plants. If it could be good for the plants, then perhaps there was some other substances that could be even better. E. see if those substances would hurt the plants. (Correct.

Consider the statement in the context of someone setting an alarm on or before their intended wake time. \"After my alarm wakes me up each morning\" essentially means \"After I turn off my alarm each morning\", implying that something that occurs after the alarm has already gone off.\n2. The question is asking what will happen after your alarm goes off, suggesting the waking process that comes after, when you turn off the alarm. In such a case, setting the alarm for 10 am means it would go off at 10 am.\n3. Choices B, C, and D provide incorrect information as they show different waking times, and choice E shows the alarm being set back before the intended wake-up time.\n4. Therefore, the answer to the question is D: 8:AM. \nThe correct answer is option \"8:AM\".\n\n### Input:\"Can't I just use cash to pay for a rental car?  You know, right?

{"text": "The question wants the number of girls who would miss the trip but it's possible there were more boys who missed the trip as well. \nThere was a total of 18 students so we can assume there were 18 cars. \n\nThe ratio of boys to girls is 8:8 because there were 8 boys and 8 girls in the group and each car had 8 seats so every car would be equal in that number of boys and girls. \n\nThe total number of people who are going to make it is 18 * 8 = 144 people. \n\nEvery one of the eight boys who was able to join the fieldtrip meant 8 students did not join the field trip so in total there were 144-8 = 136 remaining students. \n\nThe question then asks for the number of girls who were not able to join. \n136/8 = 17. However it's possible that not every girl was able to go and that some boys also didn't go. \n\nOne thing to note is that they say \"number of\" girls so it means they are counting how many girls were not able join the fieldtrip. \n\nThis means it wasn't a number of girls that could possibly go and couldn't therefore there could be less or more but there would not necessarily be every possible girl who might not go. \n\nSo there may be less girls that missed or there may be more and they don't define it which is why they just say that they are not defined. The only thing we can look at is the boys and the girls and that there were 8 boys. If there were not 8 boys then there would not be an 8:8 ratio of boys and girls. In that case there must have been 18 boys which would mean that at least 18 boys were able to go. \n\nWe do know that the number of girls who could go was not 8 because there was a total of 22 girls but there were only 8 seats in every car meaning that each car would be equally represented in that ratio of boys and girls and not every girl would be able to go. That means we need to eliminate option A and option B because we know that it wasn't 8 girls because they were all able to go because every car was equally distributed in terms of number", "answer": " 2"}

We don't know what Y is before we see X. We should look at the last digit of X, and that has to be an odd number. Let's say it's 1. Then, we subtract it to Y, to be Y-1. We cannot use the rule of subtracting the second digit because we don't know what it is. Next, we look at the second to last digits, and there are two choices of numbers 3 and 5. We use the rule of subtract the second to last digit if they're odd, and we got Y=X+1. Next, we subtract the second last digits (which are 5 in our case), and we got Y=1. So, the smallest odd integer is 1.\n\n### Rationales :The statement asks us to find the smallest odd integer that adds up with 9, with the last two digits being equal.

Choices: A: It was convenient; they could all help set up the tents B: Because the camping trip could be a memorable event for his family\nC: He did not have enough money for a stay at the hotel; his family could not afford a hotel\nD: He saved money by staying at a camping place instead of a hotel E: He was trying to escape his family\n\n### 2. What is the most obvious problem with the camping trip according to the information in the reading? Choices:  Taking the family on the camping trip is a problem.\n\n### Rationale 1:The camping trip does not look like a problem because it is a weeklong event. The number of mm of rain is also not indicative of the weather during the trip, as some days received more rain while others received less.\n### Rationales 2: The amount of rain would certainly be more beneficial than less, so there is no problem with rain at the camping place. The family would most likely benefit from camping as well rather than a hotel during a weeklong vacation. There is no explicit information about any family members escaping during the camping trip.\n### Rationes 3: The most obvious problem with his camping trip is the amount of rain experienced by Greg and his family, which is fewer than the amount of rain at his home.\n### Rantions 4: There are no problems with the camping trip that would be considered obvious.\n### Rantedion 5: He did not explain why he chose to camp with his family in particular. There are no clear reasons for the choice presented in this reading.\n\n### Example Instruction:Choose an answer for", "answer": " 12"}

E: I don't think so.\n\nRationales:  \nThinking about the way the signs works out, a limited time offer is an offer with a time period. \nFor example, if it is a new deal and you buy a TV for $500, the deal will be like the offer is for $500 for a limited time of 3 days that means there are 3 days when will only be a deal available for you to buy the TV. \n\nAlso, considering that clothing store, 20 items for $16 or $24.95 indicates how much the items would be for each customer.

If Jim weight is eight pounds less than Steve\u2019s weight, then Jim\u2019s weight is S - 4lbs, and S + 5 + 102 = 220 in the mathematical form.\n\nInput:Jim weighs 102 pounds\n\nRationales: If Jim weight is 100 pounds less than Steve's weight; then it is Jim's weight is S - S + 4 = 100.

The total weight of each bag is always 50 pounds.\nThe weight of all bags that a particular passenger brings = 50 * 5 = 250lb.\nThe total weight of all bags the people bring which is weight of luggage is W = 250 * 6\nNow, airplane can hold 6000 lb. Therefore W + 6000 = 600\nEach person can carry 250. Now, 6 / 250 = 1\nThis means all passengers bring luggage equal to them. If they brought less or more luggage, they will not be able to ride in the plane.\n\n### Now 1150 lbs. is the amount of extra luggage that plane is willing to carry. If one traveler is in excess bag limit then the maximum weight = 50 * extra 1.\nSo, in 1 person's bag:\nThere are 5 extra bags  => 5 * 50 = 250 extra lb.\nThe total passengers' luggage is 6000 / 6 = 1000 lb.

{"text": "Scientific Notation\n\nIn scientific notation, which is often used when dealing with very large or very small quantities, a number is converted to a decimal number x 10 raised to the power of y, where x is the decimal number and y is the number of powers by which 10 is to be multiplied.\n\nFor example 3 x 10^4 = 3000, 0.002 x 10^-2 = 0.0002 and 5.00 x 100 = 500\n\nAnother rule to be noted is that the exponent must be greater than or equal to zero and less than 10.\n\nThis step helps a student to write a larger, more efficient fraction in terms of a smaller fraction.\n\nFor example if you use the larger fraction 3/4 when solving 1/2 of 3, you will get 1/4 as your answer.\n\n### Input:-45 ml of liquid from a container is poured into a cylindrical beaker with a hemispherical top.

Let us understand the solution to this mathematical problem.\n\n### The steps to solve this problem are:\n\n1. The first compartment is set as the starting point in this exercise.\n2. We will start with the first compartment to show our first addition calculation of pennies from 2 to 8.\n3. 2 pennies x 12 = $24\n4.

Now, sum up the totals of all the compartments. \n7. The total we get is 12 x $24, which is $288.\n8. Now, we add 6 (6) pennies to each of the compartments and this means you will need 6 + 6 added to $288. \n9. The new totals are 6 + 6 + 6, added to $28 which is $334 \n10.

Since Jose's total supply of wine is equal to the remaining supply, that means half of his total supply is equal to a quarter of the total supply of wine left after the party.\n\nIn order to answer the question, we can apply the question to Jose's situation to reveal the answer as well.\nSuppose there were 2400 imported bottles and 1200 domestic bottles in his stock. And we also know that there was a party where the guests drank one-third of all wine. Then Jose's remaining wine supply is 600 imported bottles from his cellar.

So he now has $200 left. It must be the $500 bike. Therefore, James now has the $500 worth of stuff.\n* Since the TV cost $700, James must return it for $700. He has $500 of the $501 stuff.

Jack was the sensible drinker and Bob\n\n### was not.\n\n### B. Jack was not the sensible drinker and\n\n### Bob was.\n\n### C. Both men were sensible drinkers.\n\n### D. Neither Bob nor Jack were sensible drinkers. \n\n### E. The two men were not sensible drinkers.\n    \n### Answer : Jack was the sensible drinkers and Bob was not. \n\n## Rationale : The word \"hangover\" in line 4 suggests that after the two men shared a bottled of beer and a few chips, Bob woke up the next morning. In line 3:, Bob woke up with a headache. This implies that Bob's consumption of alcohol produced a headache, indicating that Bob's beer and chips consumption had resulted in inebriation, which in turn, contributed to his headache, an effect of drunken alcohol. This supports the conclusion that Jack was the sensible drink of the two, seeing as he did not face impairment in his fac", "answer": " 21"}

The number which divides $100$ by $8$ is equal to $5$, which is the number of bottles left in Jack's possession.\n\n### Response Explanation:\n1. Step 1: Understanding the question - the given questions consists of three parts in which Jack' bought water, his mother ordered twice the quantity and finally Jack bought few more bottles.\n2. Step 2: Analyzing each part of the question - the first part in which Jack bought water he bought 4 bottles.\n3. Step 3: Breaking down the statements based on the given information - Jack bought 4 bottles after he spent $100$, as each water bottle cost $2$. Finally, Jack bought an additional number of bottles after his mother's order which was twice of the number of bottle(4) that he already had. Let's assume that he bought $(4 /2)^{th}$ bottles after his mother called him.\n4. Step 4: Calculating the answer - if Jack bought $(4 / 2)^th$ of the bottles, then the number of bottles bought must be $(4 / 2)$th the 4 bottles - $(4 / 8)$th bottles. Let's further assume that Jack bought number bottles after his mother call him.\n5. Step 5: Transforming the final statement into mathematical expression - Jack bought $ ( 4 / 8 )^{th}$ bottles and each bottle costs $2$.\n6. Step 6: Concluding based on the given information and simplifying the mathematical expression - the mathematical expression can be simplified to $(1/2 ) ^{th}$ of the bottles - or $1/4 $ of the bottles that Jack bought earlier. Since each bottle costs $10$, Jack spent $(1/4) * 10 $ amount of money - $ 2.5 $ on the whole. Considering his initial amount of $100$ and the remaining amount spent on bottles i.e.,$2.5$, Jack has $97.50$ left in his hand.\n7. Answer: $97.5", "answer": " 71"}

Since  the rope consists of two parts with three knots and one joint, Tony's rope ends with 52 feet and  24 feet.\n2. The following formula is needed :  \\( \\sum \\text{total feet in the rope} = \\sum \\text{feet in each ropes} - \\sum \\text{knots in each ropes} + \\sum \\text{distance between each ropes} \\)\n3. Let \\(F_{1}\\) and \\(F_{2}\\) denotes the individual ropes, \\(n_{1}, n_{2}, \\dots \\) and \\(k_{1}, k_{2}, \\dots\\) respectively are the knots.\n4. The total distance in the rope is as follows:   \\(F_{1} + F_{2} + (k_{1}\\cdot6 + k_{2}\\cdot12 + \\dots ) + (3\\cdot 36 + 7\\cdot 24)\\)\n5. The total distance in joints is as follows: \\(F_{1} - k_{1} + F_2 -k_2 + \\dots \\)\n6. Since \\(F_1<20\\) and \\(F_2>12\\), the total distance is not equal to 24 feet, therefore,   \\(3\\cdot 31 - 99 = 00\\)\n7.

{"text": "Each piglet ate 20/37 (100-80) = 19. This is a complete and accurate solution.\n\n### Input :Ms. Moore took 4/6 of her salary and bought new shoes. Then, she took the remaining 2/3 and bought a suit. She had 1/3 of her salary left. How much did her salary total?\n\n### Demostration :This question is based on the relationship between fractions. To solve this, first consider the fraction of Ms. Moore's salary that she saved. The answer choice for this is 2/9 of her salary. \n\n1. From the statement, we are given that she took 4/6 and 2/3 of her salar which leaves us with 1/3 of the salary left.\n2. The question asks us to solve Ms. Moore' question by giving us the answer to 2/6th and 2/3rd as well as the question asks us, \"How much did her salary totals\"\n3. Therefore, the answer choice that gives the answer to both 2/6ths and 2/3 is 2/9.\n4. Then, we know that 2/9 of 500 = 100. Therefore, 250 x 50 = 12,500 is the correct answer to the part where she took 4/9 and 2/3s.\n5. By using the cross multiplying method, we can solve 12,595 22,500 = 24,095.

So he is watching 2 movies. \n\nThen, assume that the movie is 2.5 hours (150 minutes) then it takes 12(movies) x 150(minutes) = 1800 minutes. \n\nAlso, dividing and multiplying 8 by 1800(minutes) will give you the answer of 6.4 hours. Now, the question is how many miles is he running in 6.4 hours?\n\nThe distance that someone runs can be seen from the unit (minutes) so the conversion to miles must be divided by the unit (minutes). \n\n6.4/8(hours) = 0.75 (miles). \n\nMultiplying (0.75*60(minutes in a hour)=45 miles.

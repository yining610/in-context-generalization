This means his revenue is $143,750. It costs $10,000 to make the movies, since $1,00 costs $10, and he sells 2 DVDs for every $1.00 he spent on DVDs.  $143,950-10,00 gives him a profit $133,950.  He makes a profit of $133,750 in 5 days (5x5,500), but that is $133.750 per day.  Then multiply by 50 (133750x50) and you get an answer of $668,750 in profits. Now, let's divide that by the 1x5 days he does it for each day. You get an answer of $133.50 a day, and we know 5 days are $668,50 per week.  So it costs him $9,015.25 in 20 weeks.\n\n### Output:\n29,005\n\n### Output explanation:\nI calculated profit for 20 weeks by multiplying 133.7 by 20.", "answer": " 448000"}

Copy the text completely, then add a response.\n\n### Task Instruction :\nAs a human, I understand the desire to be in control. We seem to have a basic assumption that other people are trying to control us, either to get something out of us, or to punish us, or to try to bring us down with them. We tend to see people as other, or different and dangerous. This leads to prejudice and conflict, and fear based control and domination. We also seem to see the natural world for what it is - just a lot of stuff we are trying not to hurt. We don't like to share with the animals, and think we can just take what we want and ignore everything else as long as we can still get what we want. We act out of fear and greed.\n\n### Solution :\n\nI can learn to accept and love my inner wisdom, and to see it in others. I can look at the beautiful diversity that surrounds me and learn to love that diversity. I can learn not to project onto other people what I am not willing to confront as within myself. I can learn to look at greed and fear in myself. I can learn what it means to be responsible and ethical, and to love the challenge of understanding the world around me, which includes understanding that we are all part of the same world together, with its own wisdom. There is a natural flow and rhythm to our universe. There is a power and force in our world which manifests both through what I call \"destruction\" and \"creation.\" I can find beauty everywhere. I can learn to love.\n\n\n### Question :\nIf you think that your response does not make sense, your response will show in the result because the result is not a single result.

{"text": "John ate 700 calories.\n\n### Solution:\nFirst, you enter the data for the candy.  There will be 3 servings of 120 calorie each and at the end of the math you know that that you have 360 calories.\nSecond, you enter the data about the candy including half of the package.  This will tell you that you have 3/2 of the total and you have 1/2 of each of the 3 servings making the total 2/5 of each item.\n\nThe number of servings is 3.  The total number of calories in the servings is 360.  The data for one serving includes 120/2 as you know the data is half a package.  With 3 servings there are 90 for each serving.  You can find 1/2 of the calories in each serving by dividing 1/2 the number of total calories by 2.\n\nLastly, you need to figure out what you have left. With half of the package there are 3 half packages.  You divide half the amount you found for each serving of the package making 3 half packages.\nThe last package is 3/2 of 90 so the answer is 90.

{"text": "The question states that Jack collects 2 litres of seawater. For 2 litres of water, it needs 200 ml of salt, not the whole 2000.  There are two litres of water, so 1 litre of salt is required to make up for 0.05% salt. The percentage is very small and I had forgotten how small it was by using the \"0.05\". For each litre, we need 2.7 ml of salt. We'll round 2.7 mls to 3 mls of salt. Jack will need 6 mls of salt to season his fish (2.7 x 2).\n\nLet's say that when a liquid evaporates into a gas, we can count by the number of moles and use \"Avogadro's number\". That is 6.02 x 10^23.\n\nThe question says that the water evaporates. \"Evaporates\" means that \"some of them go away.\" For example, a cup of water boiled and turned into steam will be evaporated into a gas. We would count the water in the cup as one mole, not by the number of litres. We cannot divide a mole by a litre. A cup of water can also be evaporated and not turned into a gas. Some of the liquid in a cup turns to water vapor and stays in the room. We would count the cup of water as one mole because we still have it.\n\n200 ml x 0.05 = 10 mls x Avogadro's # = 0.5 litres of salt\n\n0.5 litres x 2 = 1 litre of 200mg salt required for every 1 litre (1000 mls) of seawater.\nJack needs 147 gms of salt to season his 2 litre cup of fish.\n\n### Input:\"You are supposed to do something to show your gratitude to someone who did something for you.

{"text": "```text\nOutput:33,Ed found 7 limpet,2 oysters,4 conch, Jacob found 2 more, so the total shells are 33\n```\n\n### Why the above input, answer?\n\n#### A. It will be easier to find the difference of a shell collection.  \n\nThe answer can be easily found by comparing each shell count.  \nIn the above answer, the first 5 lines are for Ed and the last 4 lines are for Jacob. After the first two shells, the others are all calculated.   \nThe difference is the second last shell in Ed's shells, which is 2. The difference is the third last shell in Ed' case, which is 2, then the answer is 33.  \n\n#### B. The input can be done in multiple ways.  \n\nThe above case is the most direct and easiest way to get an answer.  \nHowever, in actual tests, people will give several options. The key is to figure out what kind of input the program needs, and then use the right calculation to get the input.  \nIn addition to counting shells, there are 3 other methods, but they are useless in this program. There will be a large number of extra operations, which will not only increase the time but also increase the memory requirements for computing. They are as follows:  \nI. Calculate each kind of shell in turn, using the shells of one person and subtracting from the shells of the other. For example, if the two shells we calculate are scallop and oyster, the first shell is the shell number that can be found in scallop, but not in oyster, and the second shell is vice versa. To avoid the confusion of the same shell name.\n\nII. Let the total number be K, and then use the input of 7 and the number of oyster shells to calculate the total number of shells. For example, if K is 7, then the total number of shellfish found in the whole of the beach is the total number of 7 divided by the quantity of oyster shell found minus the quantity of conch shell found. In this method, there is no need to compare the number of common shells between people. The calculation of scallop shells is not needed.\n\nIII. We can also subtract the", "answer": " 30"}

And clothing can be made of a material that causes sweating instead of trapping the heat. The best way to get heat is to be bundled up since the body absorbs heat better when its surface is warmer. \n```\n\n#### B\n```\n- Loose clothings can trap the heat, which will make us warmer.

{"text": "The method of calculating kosher meals is the same because it relies on what we already know. Kosher meals only include vegetables, fruits, nuts, and nut products, and meal delivery requires that there is vegetarian food included in meals unless there is a medical need or there is an exemption to the kosher requirements. So we can use that we will exclude vegetables, fruits and nuts from the vegan meals and meal delivery because when vegan meals deliver, we always have meat-free meals. So, vegan and koshere don't go together. They are mutually exclusive. I can subtract all the kosher meals from the vegan meal to find the answer. Now all that remains is to subtract all the koser meals from the total number of meals delivered. So, our answer will be 27- (7+8+3), which is 16. I hope that helps you understand this problem.\n\n### Input : Rita's mom and dad are married. So, Rita is an only child. Her parents have five grandchildren.  The family is attending a large party at Rita's workplace with many other families. How many cousins will Rita have there?\n\n### Solution:\nThis problem is simple to calculate. We can simply apply the total number of kids divided by two and multiply by the grandchildren that the family has. The total of the children should be 10 because Rita is only child. 8/2=6, 9/2=4.5. 10 goes into 6 five times, so the answer is 6, and the same goes for the grandchildren. So, there are 6 cousins present at the party.", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "170\n\n### Reasoning:\nBecause I have been getting answers off the Internet I guessed\n  my thinking process so I will attempt to describe it. I guessed that there was a lot of back and forth of information. I used the wording, \"60% of the workers drive to work and 1/2 of the workers who do not drive to work take public transportation.\"  Once I read this I knew that there were 100 workers who did not drive to work. Of the 100 who do not drive to the 50 who take a train or bus. I guessed that the other 50 worked for the company too. So all in all I guessed there were 170 who work for the company. That ended up being the correct response to the question. To be exact there 144 workers that drive and 26 that do not drive and 26 of that 26 are taking public transportation. The rest of the answer is based on my guess. If I put myself in the position of being interviewed I would never guess that the answers were so easy. This kind of writing requires a lot more planning time than the actual math.  The following questions are a sample of the kinds of questions I could not answer.    It is very hard to know what kind of background knowledge they are looking for in these questions as well as knowing the reasoning process that they are expecting you to have.\n\n###\n\nInput: How many hours did you work yesterday?\n\n### Demostration:I am 28\n\nInput: How much money is 28 dollars?\n\n### Solution:\nSorry can't do the math at the moment I really want to figure this out but I guessed there was probably a way to get the answer.   But I didn't think I could add 28 and 50 and get it in 1 minute.\n\n### Requst and response:The two solutions work but the first solution needs more work than the second solution.  The second solution is better because I get the answer faster and because  the answer is a lot easier to read.  With the first solution it took 34 steps and with the second solution it took\n only 6 steps.\n\n### Additional responses:I want to answer these questions the question are more then I", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "Answer: 85 (8 pens and 6 pens)\n\n### Response 1:\nThe letter c comes before x. Therefore the answer is B or C. Since you have less choices, it makes sense to assume that A would come first in the alphabet so C. So the question is: What do you wear that comes before the letter X in the alphabet? The answer is a \u201cscar\u201d because I have to think about it but I did get to that conclusion.\n\n### Response2:\nI used to do this problem by drawing a number line. I drew 7 with a dot under it and did it the number line way but that was super annoying because I had to keep switching to the number line to keep track. So I figured, screw that. Let's do it the hard way. I started off by writing down a question. \"If I have an equal number of pennies and pencils how would I know what number to add to start.\" And the answer is addition. And the second question could have been, if I have an equal number pencils and pencils, how would I know what subtraction to do next. After that I would have come to my answer.\n\n### Example Response 3:\nSo the answer to this question has to be B or C. Now I am not one for assuming, if I can see an answer I'll do that, if I can't I will think it through. To get the answer to this next we need to know for sure how many letters are between C and X. So I went to a list and I found that their was 20 letters between C and X. Now I know that the answer has to be one of these two, so I can take these out of my list. The answer was C or Z. If I get those out then i know there are two choices that will lead me to the answer. Now I know that C is a choice. I know this because the question refers to pencils and the letter c is before that. Now I have to determine if X is an option. So I wrote down my question, if I had an equal amount of X in my collection, what would I do next. And the answer I wrote at the end of this question is addition. If you know the answer then you know you need to subtract from the amount you have. The subtraction number is 8", "answer": " 22"}

{"text": "The number of votes for the unicorn, witch and dragon cakes were 48, 14, and 20 respectively. This means the number of votes for each of those cakes was 48 + 14 + 20 = 82. Then, the number of people who voted was the total number of votes cast minus the number of votes for only one cake (because 7 is not one of the three cakes in the question). Since the total number of votes is 82 and 7 is not one, the remaining number is 82 - 7 = 75 (76 - 75 = 1, so it cannot be 70, 72, or 74. 75 is the best answer). Then, the number of votes for a cake that some people voted for is 75 = 25 + 60 + 0(all voted for the same cake). Finally, the number of people voting for a cake not mentioned in the question is the difference of the total number of votes and the number of votes cast for a cake not in the question.

The number that is the result is then multiplied by the amount of profit that per package brings to the company by dividing it by the total amount of packages. So the profit for each distribution center is $5000 per Day and therefore the profit for both distribution centers is $10000 per Day. Since there are three distribution centers, the profit for each one is $3333 per day. If the total profit is $100,000 then that means that the total amount of packages moved is 333300 packages.", "answer": " 14000"}

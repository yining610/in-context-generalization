This is $5.25 from his birthday/holiday money, $6.00 from selling video games, and $5.00 from working on other odd jobs. It totals up $16.25, so he will save $16.26 from the job money. After that, he'll make another $600, so he spends $3.04 on other expenses. Then, he'll save $36.92 with his birthday/hollyday money, another $35 with money from selling video games; thus, he will save $72.22. That equals $72.24 in total.\n\n### Input; In a recent survey of teenagers 83% had smart phones, 61% had a good grade point average in school, and 21% played outside with a group of friends. A randomly selected teenager with a random number was chosen, and the student said he/she had a 3.8 gpa. Based on this, what is the probability that the teenager had a smart phone?\n\n### Answer:First, we'll figure out if the teenager had an average grade point average of lower or a 3.0 gpa or higher. Let's begin with a case where they don't have a smart phone. This is a 1/2 because they could have a smart phone or not.\n\nWhen they have a 3.0 or higher GPA or lower, we'll use 1/4 because they have a good or bad GPA. Now, put these together. We'll do a total of 1/2 + 1/4 + 70% or more of teens having a smart phone.\n\nThis means we find the probability of getting at least 70% of teenagers answering having a smart phone. This means the probability is 1/6.25 or a total of 0.16 for them having a smart phone. That means the probability is 0.16.\n\n### Output:\n\n![](./assets/image11.png)\n\n### Output\n![](./assets2.png", "answer": " 460"}

{"text": "52\n\n### Explanation and Comments:\nFirst she should use what we know to determine how many students take place in the classroom. We know that 2 students are out and we know that 1 less than 3 times the amount of students absent. That means that the third time number does not appear. For the next equation, the restroom have 2x2/3=1. If the classroom has 1x2/3=2/3 and we add the two numbers 1+2/3 = 1.5 we divide 1.5 by 2 and we find that there is 3.75 students per classroom, which we can approximate to 3. We use this number to determine how many students are in each part of the classroom. There are four classrooms that each one is 3/2 and each 1/2, which is equal to 1.5. Then we multiply each classroom by its parts and this gives us a total of 6 so we can take the sum of the two to get 8 and we divide by 5 to get 1.6.\nThe students in the classrooms can be represented through this equation (3.75 \u00d7 (2/3)) + (2/3) = 1.6. For the students that are absent we could have the following equation (1x2/3) = (2/3) \u2013 (1/2).\nAfter combining these two equations we get ((3.75*2/3) + 1.6) \u2013 (2/3) or simply ((3.75+1.6) -2.166) which becomes 6.166 and divided by (1x2/2) or 1.566 but this equals about 3.76 since this is not a perfect number we find that there are approximately 376 students in the classroom.\n\n### Reference:\nWikipedia: [How to Solve Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_of_an_equation)", "answer": " 23"}

You will multiply that number to the number you put into the bucket that started with the smallest amount and you are going to have the same number so the smallest bucket will have 4 more pieces than the others, the second bucket will have 2 less pieces than the first bucket so the remaining bucket with 3 more pieces then the second bucket. The last bucket will have 11 more pieces then this bucket, so the first bucket will have an input and output of 4 more pieces, the second bucket will only have 2 more (remaining 10) because bucket 1 was the smallest, the third bucket will have 3 more pieces, giving bucket 2 the maximum number of pieces in the group because it is the smallest, as you keep doing this you will have to add the number of pieces to each bucket so the total number will always increase. If the third bucket had 7 more pieces than the other bucket, if you add the 11 remaining pieces, you will be at the max, 89 9*9=81 88\n\n## Author:J.K.", "answer": " 37"}

{"text": "400\n\n### Solution:\nAt first glance, this problem may look like a division problem. However, to get the correct answer, divide into the numbers in the equation, not the total number of cars. It is 100cars / 2 at the back parking lot. We'll call this 100c. Using what we were given and adding the 2 at the back of the driveway to the number of cars total at the beginning of the play, we get 700 total cars. If we do 700-100c, we get 600c. We divide 700 into the 600c to get 1.16666. So the number we are looking for is:\n\n1.1667 \n\nSince we round to the nearest one hundredth, 1.16 is what we want. Therefore the correct response to this problem is 400.\n\n### Hints:\nThe key is to realize at first glance, it is more of a multiplication question. Multiply 2 by 100 to get 200, add that to the beginning number of 100 to make 300. Now take 300 plus the number of cars at the beginning, 700, to get 1000. The key is to get all three pieces together to find out the number of cars to add or subtract to make 700 equal more than 700 with 200 added the 700 original amount.", "answer": " 300"}

{"text": "He was driving 5 miles to the supermarket, 2 more miles turning around and driving back, and then the same journey to the farm, plus 2 miles back to his house to drive from the supermarket. Total distance driven = 12 miles. Let's assume the trip to the farm can be ignored for this problem and just think of the other 2 trips. The two trips can each be considered completely different trips, so we'll treat them as different situations, rather than one continuous journey with intermittent stops. If we treat them as separate trips, the total mileage equals 12, the number of miles driven between the 2 trips, and this is multiplied by the number of gallons of fuel used, to get gallons consumed. The number of gallons used depends on the trip and in this case it's the same regardless of which trip we're looking at. Therefore, gallons consumed for both trips divided by 12 equals gallons consumed per trip. Gallons consumed for both times is the same and it's the same for the supermarket and farming trip. Gallons consumbed per trip for the supermarket and farm trip can be found by dividing 12 by.5, and it's the exact same as farming trip's gallons consumed per each trip, so this number is:.5\n\n### Explanation:We can see, for example, that the first trip (supermarket) involved 25 miles, but only half a gallon of gas used. Let's make these variables, to get better understanding, so m stands for miles and g stands for gallons. So, let's express the equation as follows:\n\n`12/m + 25/m =?`\n\nAnd we solve by dividing each side by the other. Using the 3rd variable we can separate it:\n\n`1/3(25 + m) =?`\n\nTherefore, m = 5, m =.5, meaning that the truck, on average, burned.5 gallons of gas per mile:\n\n`- (25/3) =.5 or 8.3 miles/gallon`", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "Lydia\u2019s small pool has water, which adds to 60 gallons in total. She fills her pool using a garden hose, which will fill it at a rate of 1.5 gallons every 8 seconds. Lydia\u2019s pool has a small leak, which adds water at a rate of.1 gallons every minute.\n\nTo solve this question, you would figure out how much time it would take to completely fill the pool, and then subtract this from the time it would take to leave the leak unchecked.\n\nIf we were to take 60 gallons and divide it into 1 minute, we get 60 gallons/1, and the rest is a decimal. As for the garden hose, we need to figure out the rate that it fills per minute, which is 1.5 and divide that into the number of minutes that we are trying to fill the pool. This gives us 60/1.5 or 40 minutes for half the pool, and so our answer is given in minutes, that is 40/1.5 = 2.6 minutes. If the pool took 5 minutes to fill using only the gadern hose without the leak, it would take around 2.6 minutes using a hole. We need to subtract these two, which gives 2.6-5 = -2.4 minutes. So therefore, the leak would take 2.4 minutes, adding 2.4 to the time it would normally take to fill 60 gallons would add 2.4 minutes to the original 5 minutes. Thus, we can see that the answer is 7.6 minutes.", "answer": " 40"}

The time unit for a unit of measure can be either the first unit of measure or the second unit of measure, depending on the context. When the council president calls to order, the meeting begins. The order of operations requires the question to be answered by finding the amount of minutes. This amount of minutes in the unit of time is used to set the limit for minutes by division by the unit of time. This amount of minutes is not converted to seconds because division without conversion is not conversion. The council meeting begins at 7:45 according to paragraph one.\n\n### Question:You may earn a bonus if you work on a Sunday. If you earn a bonus if there are more workers than there are days or fewer workers than there are days?\n\n### Answer: I earn a bonus if I work on a Sunday more workers than there are.\n\n### Reason:When a condition is set by a clause in the question, it is followed by a question mark. The condition is the most important part of a question because it asks which parts of the sentence can change. If the condition is true, then the condition may happen, but the condition is false if the condition does not happen. The question mark says the most important part. The answer is the most important. The answer is more workers. The reason more workers are more workers is that there are more workers than days.\n\n#### Answer: If I work on a Sunday, more workers than there are are more workers than there is.", "answer": " 600"}

{"text": "$147\n\n### Explanation:\n1) She gave $33 to the household share, which I think was mentioned previously (therefore I am answering 33 instead of 42).\n\n2) She gave $26 more than the household share each month. We know Angie pays $147 in taxes every month because she had $18 dollars left over. Therefore we divide 157 by 18, which equals 8.416666667 dollars, rounded to 8.41 dollars.\n\n### Solution:\n### Input:In a country, there are some people with low income (earn less than a fixed amount of money), and some wealthy individuals (earning a high salary). A country must spend $300,000 on food and $2 million for other benefits (education, social services...). Expenses for food only represent 0.25% to the GDP of the country, and benefits will be the rest 8% of Gross Domestic Product, in other words, 8% of benefits is equivalent to 0.08% of the country\u2019s GDP. If we take 1% of the total expenses (i.e. 300000 + 2000000 - 100 to avoid zero entry), the total annual expenses and benefits for this country is 2030000 (i.e. sum of $2 million and $30000). How much of the population is on low income? \n\n### Demostration\n\nInput: The salary of this country is at 250,000\nOutput: $191830\n\nIn the given information, there is no need to get more details about the country's expenses (because you can get it easily from output). Based on input, the Gross Domestic Product(GDP) of this country is $10,000,00. The country will need to spend 1% of GDP every year. In this country, a total sum of $2,000, 000 is spent on benefits, that means 0.0889% of GDP and 0.9100%", "answer": " 20"}

When she reaches $1210 (one half of the profit of $2420, plus $310), she still needed another $320 to pay for her ships. The difference (difference between $610 and $1210) is $600. So the original profit was $2420 + $960, which is $3380. The profit was split between herself and her friends and family. When she split it between herself and the amount contributed by her family and friends, it left her with $1670. At $1670 and $310, that makes her original profit $2180.

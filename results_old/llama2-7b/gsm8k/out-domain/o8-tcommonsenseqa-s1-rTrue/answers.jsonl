Choices: A: hard shell B: soft shell C: dirt D: dry E: shell\nRationales: Initial Reasoning Steps. 1. It's pretty clear that the back of a turtle is a shell. It's something that is attached to the turtle's body and that it uses for protection.\n2. So that leaves us with options A, B, C, D or E.\n3. But the back of a tuttle is typically solid and not soft, so we can rule out options B and C.\n4. Option D is also a no-go. The back of a turtles is typically dry and not wet.\n5. So the final options are: hard shell, dry, shell.\n6. Hard shell is the clear answer since a turtle's shell is hard and dry and therefore both dry and hard.\nAnswer: A, D: Hard shell\n\nInput: A man called me at 5pm, he wanted me to where?

We can also cross control panel (C) off the list, as the term \"control panel\" is most commonly used to refer to a panel of buttons or switches used to control systems or machines.

Choices:  S: a firefighter's work A: a sports game B: a school C: an election D: a concert\nRationales: We can first eliminate option D: a concert. While a concert does have some unpredictable elements, it is unlikely that the outcome of the whole event is unpredictable. Similarly, options A: a sports game and B: a school are unlikely to result in unpredictable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, we can assume that firefighter S's work has the highest probability of being unpredictable.\n\nOption S would seem the most appropriate option here, however, it's important to identify if such unpredictability also applies to the terms A, B, or C.\n\nWe can identify if any of the terms A, B or C are unpredictable in outcome by reading the choices we have listed. We are told that \"any given day...\", which we can replace with \"today\" to get a clearer view. In this scenario we are also given choices A, B and C in addition to the only thing occurring today: S.\n\nThis allows us to consider what \"events\" occur for a firefighter when they aren't working.

The car is a physical vehicle, so in this case we know the baby is in either a house where the car is parked, or in the car where the baby is a passenger. \n2. So we can safely rule out any choice that has \"only a car,\" as that does not indicate a real and plausible scenario.\n3. Similarly, \"only in my home\" doesn't sound right either. This leaves us with three remaining choices: B, C, D\n4. Option B: \"at home\" works, as \"at home\" is equivalent to being \"in my home\"\n5.

In the same way, option B: control panel cannot be grabbed, as it is an item that can be touched but not grabbed.\n4. Option C: opening doors cannot be grabbed either, as this requires human contact for it to work and we cannot grab something by touching it.\n5. The same applies to the option D: doorknobs, as they are used for unlocking doors and opening doorways, not for being grabbed.\n6. Therefore the only option that can fulfil our task is option E: doorway.\n7. In answer to the question, the correct option is E: doorway. \nAnswer: E: doorway\n\nInput: When is it bad to use too many adjectives in a sentence? Choices: 1:  A: to express myself 2:  B: too 3: C: not 4:  D: too E: good\nRationales: First, the question asks when it is bad to use too many of something.\n2. Second, it is asking this concerning adjectives, which modify nouns and are used to describe particular characteristics of the nouns they are related to.\n3. Therefore we can conclude that among the given choices 1: A to express myself, 2: B too, 3: C not, and 4: D too E: good, these are all adjectives and all apply to the scenario being described.\n4. From this, we can conclude that 3: C is the only choice that would be appropriate to the question. \nAnswer: C: not\n\nInput: How do we find an exact number in division, or to find the dividend and divisor?

The first method that comes to mind would be subtraction, but in the question we are told that we need the exact number.\n4. The second method is division, but this provides us with the quotient and the remainder. We need the dividend and the", "answer": " 15"}

Now, we can eliminate option D: doorknobs, since a doorknob is attached to or hinged on a door.\n5. We can identify options E: door and A: doorway as relevant.\n6. A doorway contains a door in it by definition.\n7. Thus, we can say that the doorway is the location where you can reach and grab the door.\n8. So, the answer is A.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: What can be found in an office? Choices: \t A: a computer B: pens C: file cabinets D: business cards E: chairs\nRationales:\t 1. First, we can state what is not in an office. \n\n2. Among the six given options, C: file cabinets is not an option. \n\n3. File cabinets only hold documents in an office, but they are not in the office itself.\n\n4. Next, eliminate option D: business cards.\n\n5. Then, eliminate option E: chairs. \n\n6. From this, remaining options A: a computer and B: pens can be considered as possibilities. \n\n7. A computer is used in offices and it is included as an option.\n\nBut, B: pens is not an option.\n\n8. So, this can be narrowed down to a choice between A and B. \n\n9. An office typically contains business cards of office employees, but A: a computer does not. \n\n10. The computer in the office may not be the one you want, but it is not a place to find pens.\n11. So this leads to the choice that doesn't make sense as the remaining option, B: pens, is eliminated. \n12. Thus, the only answer choice remaining is A: a computer. \n13.

{"text": "exception to the rule. To grab a television, you would pick it up, as it is not contained by a doorway (no door necessary to bring it into the room).\n3. Moving to option D: doorknobs, this option states that the doorknob belongs to a door. Since we are talking about the object contained by the doorway, that \"object's\" doorknob, option D is excluded.\n4. Continuing, option E: doorway, is another way of asking the same thing. It means if you don't know what to 'grab the object by', you just grab the doorway. Therefore, from both of these options, we eliminate all of the options excepting A and C: control panel and opening doors.\n5. There remains to be clarity about what a 'control panel' is exactly. However, it's most often used to refer to the buttons and dials on a TV, radio, or other electrical appliance. Since they aren't contained by a doorway, C: control panel is excluded.\n6. What remains to us is A: open windows, which means we can't grab the object through the window.\n7. This leaves us with B: the opening itself as the only option left. So, the answer is B.\nAnswer: B.

Therefore, we can see, the answers can be options B: control panel, D: doorknobs, and E: doorway.\n4. A control panel is in a doorway but not contained by a wall as the doorway is wider than a control panel in some doors.\n5. On the other hand, a doorway is clearly contained by a door.\n6. A doorknob is also contained by a door and not by a wall.\n7. However, a doorknob seems too small to reach an item in a doorway.\n8. So, the only answer that actually fits is E: doorway. \n9. The question, therefore, could have been interpreted as \"where would you grab an object that is in a doorway\".\nAnswer: E: doorway\n\nInput: What does Duckie mean when he says \"You look great\" to his friend? Choices:  D: He looks thinner B: He looks younger E: He looks more alive C: He looks prettier A: He looks uglier\nRationales:\n\n1. Duckie is the friend of Shaggy from Scooby-Doo cartoons.\n2. The question is asking about the interpretation of his compliment. \n3. Looking at the choice set, the given choices indicate that Duckie thinks his friends have a certain quality or attribute. \n4. For instance, \"You look thinner\" implies that his friend has lost some weight. \n5. \"You look younger\" implies that his friend looks fresher or more energetic. \n6. \"You look prettier\" could mean any number of things that imply a compliment. \n7. \"You look uglier\" obviously indicates the opposite, which is to imply that Duckie thinks he looks bad. \n8. Therefore, it makes sense to eliminate options A and C. \n9. Similarly, option B implies that Duckie thinks that his friend looks more younger. The problem is, even if you want to interpret the phrase as literal, Duckie does not have access to that information since he and his friends are not living for the same era. \n10", "answer": " 600"}

Choices:   A: bagels B: loaf of bread C: cookies D: candy bar E: cream puff\nRationales: In the question, the surname is \"Baker\", so it's a first name followed by a surname. We know this because of the apostrophe.\n1. First, we want to eliminate any option that does not contain a surname of \"Baker\".\n2. The correct answer choice will contain something delicious, and will be an edible gift that would suit any workplace. So, we rule out anything that's not edible, leaving us with the choice between: \"bagels\", \"candy bar\", \"cream puff\", \"loaf of bread\", and \"cookies\".\n3. So that our choice is edible and something suitable for the workplace, we can remove \"loaf of bread\" and \"cookies\". This leaves us with \"bagels\", \"cream pufff\", and \"candy bar' which contains more than one edible item. Therefore, we eliminate \"cream puff\" and move to a choice with just one item.\n4. If we pick something sweet, we can easily eliminate \"candy bar\", since we can find sweet treats almost anywhere. So this leaves us with a choice of \"bagels\".\n5. Now, we know that it's a coworker with a \"Baker\" surname and that they will be receiving an edible gift, we have to determine what kind of workplace it is.

Moving to option C: opening doors, we can eliminate this answer, because as its name suggests, this is an object that helps us open the door, rather than grab something from within a doorway.\n4. If you have to grab something that's contained by a doorway, it suggests that you must be near to that doorway in the first place. This means the object is easily accessible. Since the question does not provide any other hints, it means the object must be contained somewhere within the doorway itself or even within the room itself.\n5. Hence, options D: doorknobs and E: doorways can be eliminated. \n6. However, even with these eliminations, there can only be one answer, and one answer that makes the most sense according to the question, and this is B: control panel.\n7. The control panel is an object found on doors that controls the movement of the doors. Therefore, if you are near this object, you can easily grab it.\n8.

So the other three options remain: B: control panel, C: opening doors, and D: doorknobs.\n5. A control panel is not an object that is contained physically in a doorway since it can typically be found on the exterior of the doorway but not within its structure. Similarly, opening doors are not objects that are contained in doorways. \n6. This leaves us with B: control panel, which means the correct answer is B: control panel.\nAnswer: B.

Choices:  a. blue eye shadow b. earring c. headband d. lip gloss e. skirt\nRationales: First of all, we need to find out what the options are, and we can see that they are the five nouns: eye shadow, earring, headband, lip gloss, and skirt.\nThen, we need to find the verb that goes with each noun. Here are the verbs that go with each noun: put on, wear, do, use, or have. So, let's do it:\n\na) eye shadow: b) earring: c) headband: d) lip gloss: e) skirt\n\n### Answer: a) Put on or do something to blue eye shadow, b) Wear earring, c) Wear headband or wear a headband, d) Use lip gloss, e) Put on or wear skirt\n\nNotice the use of 'do something' which implies action.\n\n###\n\nAnswer: Put on or do something with blue eye shadow\n\n###", "answer": " 45"}

The question is to determine where people are asked to stand with their bodies in a position with their legs shoulder-distance apart.\n2. 'When resting' we can't be in a playroom.\n3. We can't be at a playground.\n4. For 'outdoors', we don't usually stand with our legs shoulder-distance apart, since we mostly walk.\n5.

{"text": "object that may be inside the room but cannot be contained by the doorway. It can be easily grabbed and held.\n3. We cannot grab option B: control panel, because, again, it is not inside the doorway but is contained by an electrical panel.\n4. Option C: opening doors, also cannot be grabbed. Doors open and close, but they do not contain objects.\n5. Option D: doorknobs are not objects. They are connected to the doorway opening.\n6. Finally, we are left with option E: doorway. This is a wall, floor or ceiling that is covered by a door. Thus, doorways contain the objects that are inside the room. So, we can safely eliminate all the other choices by ruling out that they don\u2019t contain any objects.\n7. We know that we have to choose something that contains objects. So, we can eliminate the possibility of choosing an empty doorway. (Doorways are like the walls you see inside rooms. Therefore, they contain objects).\nAnswer: E: doorway\n\nInput: What does a doctor do when a patient is sick? Choices: 1. A: examine patient B: administers medication C: recommends patience D: prescribes medicine E: refers patient to specialist\nRationales: The question asks what does a doctor do when their patient is ill.\n1. Looking back at our earlier example (the man with leprosy), the doctor took measures including examination of the patient, prescription medicine, and a recommendation of patience.\n2. In this case, the man was prescribed some medicine to remove the itchiness and pain caused by the leprosy. This would reduce his chances of spreading the infection. In addition, some patience was required as well, as the disease would require a long time to cure.\n3. The question gives us many options: examines patient, administers medication, recommends patience, prescribes medicine, and refers patient to specialist.\n4. However, we can also eliminate some options. For instance, \u2018Recommends patience\u2019: this does not directly help the patient. It would also fall in line with \u2018refers patient to specialist\u2019, which also doesn\u2019t relate directly to the question.\n5. Option \u2018Examines patient", "answer": " 283"}
{"text": "object that is not contained by a doorway\n3. Similarly, we can cross off options B: control panel and C: opening doors as there are no doorways in the given options\n4. In the remaining options, option D sounds good, but since the doorway itself is included, I don't think it will yield the intended choice\n5. Option C seems the best choice, as we are looking for an item contained by the doorway\n6. While we don't know which doorway this is, we do know that the doorway is a structure that encloses the opening between two hallowed spaces.\n7. Now, from the remaining choices, we can eliminate option D, 'doorway', as we have already determined that the doorway itself contains the item.\n8. Option D sounds quite good, as we have found a choice that includes the doorway yet is not the doorway itself.\n9. Since this choice is a part of a doorway, we can assume that it encloses an opening between two hollowed spaces, which is what we seek.\n10. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is option D: doorknobs. \nAnswer: D: doorknows\n\nInput: The people were doing what in the market? Choices:  Hanging out A: going to the store B: walking around C: buying stuff D: moving stuff E: hanging up\nRationales:1. The question asks the people in the market were doing.\n2. The only suitable answers should be activities that can be done by people in a market.\n3. Of the given options, \"going to the store\" is probably the most common or most likely to be done by someone in the market.\n4. Therefore we need to eliminate all the other options.\n5. As the given choices are: \"going to the store\", \"walking around\", \"buying stuff\", \"moving stuff\" and \"hanging up\".\n6. We can eliminate option C because \"moving stuff\", is an improper phrase in this context. \n7. Similarly, we can eliminate option E, which is not specific enough to be considered a suitable answer.\n8.

Looking briefly at option C: Opening Doors, it could be an object from within a door, but it seems out of line to expect a set of opening doors to be a candidate for containing an object. Therefore, we can eliminate it.\n5. Doorways themselves do seem like a reasonable option. So we move on looking at this option.\n6. Looking at the answer choices, option D: Doorknob is incorrect. Doorknobs are simply a feature of a door, not an area that contains something else.\n7. Option E: Doorway is incorrect. Doorways aren't holding or containing anything, they are simply a space in a building that a door opens into.\n8. Thus, the answer should be B: Opening Doors.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: How does a witch tell time? Choices: 1. By holding an hourglass 2. By looking at her clock 3. By telling the hour 4. By reading a calendar 5. By checking the weather 6. By reading an alarm clock\nRationales: The answer to this problem is B, and there may be some tricks to see if someone is a witch.\n1. One option is for a witch to hold an hour glass that tells her the hour. We can eliminate this because holding an hourglass doesn't actually tell anyone the time. However, a witch could tell the time by reading a calendar that tells out loud what happens on certain dates. That would make some sense for a witch to know, and if that is the case, we can eliminate all of the other options except for C4.\n2. Witches may not be able to read a calendar due to their powers being blocked.\n3. If a witch could read a calendar, the witch could read clocks and look at their clocks. That would make sense due to the fact that having such powers, she would use them for daily purposes.\n4. We can eliminate option that says she has to \"check", "answer": " 27"}

Choices: A: a refrigerator B: a stove C: a dime D: a pencil E: a suitcase\nRationales: Logic Reasoning Steps are the process of creating a logical and rational argument using a sequence of statements that connect specific events (or words) to one another with the intention of arriving at a specific conclusion. \n1. The question is about a man who wants the latest and greatest.\n2. He knows that this usually involves buying a certain product, but it's unclear what that product is. \n3. We need to determine which product the man is most likely to buy if he is concerned about getting the latest and greatest version.\n4. Among the given options, if the man were to focus on material possessions, he could buy a: dime, refrigerator, suitcase, or stove.\n5. It's clear that this person would not look for a dime, as that is a very old coin. \n6. Among the remaining choices, a pencil is unlikely as this is relatively an inanimate object and there is not any connection between buying a pencil and getting the latest and greatest item.\n7. Next, a suitcase would not satisfy the man's desire to buy something with the latest and greatest technology.\n8. A stove would be possible, but again with a lack of other information, this is an unlikely choice.\n9. So the only likely option left is B: a refrigerater.\n10.

Similarly, we also eliminate option C: opening doors, as there is no specific indication that the door is unique enough for an object to be contained behind it.\n5. The answer could be option D: doorknobs, as they can be connected either to a door handle or to a lock - these mechanisms are typically built into the doorways of buildings, which could potentially hold the object.\n6. However, doorknobs often don't require us to make physical contact with them to operate, so the answer might be option E: doorway, which allows for physical access to the object contained within.\n7. We can also eliminate the option B, as it is not very likely for technology to be placed on the same doors that lead to the rooms that can contain a specific object.\n8.

Next, option D: doorknabs are an object that can be found on a door, so they can qualify as contained by a doorway as the question stated. \n6. However, the other option E: doorway can be eliminated as there is no need to mention the doorway itself as being contained by it or not, since this is already understood as a doorway containing something.\n7. We can narrow it down to the two remaining options: D: doorknobe or E: doorway.\n8. Since we're not looking for a place where we can grab an object or an action involving a doorknob, we will be looking for a doorway. \n9. So, the answer has to be E: doorway. \n10.

Therefore, the answer would be that you would grab an object which is contained by a door way, the answer would be D: door knob.\nAnswer: D. door knob \n\nInput: What is the key feature of a clock? Choices: 1. The numbers that it shows 2. The minute hand 3. The hour hand 4. Its face 5. Its movement 6. Its time\nRationales: First, the question is about the key feature of a 'clock', a device which measures the passage of time.\n7. For a clock to be a time-measuring device, it must have something that indicates the time. \n8. While a clock does have the numbers on the face, and it is one of the important features of a clock. But it's not the key feature.\n9. Since a clock must be able to indicate time, and it does have a working movement, it does also have the movements that show the time. So it does have the movement as well.\n10. That means, it has the face as well. Therefore, A, C, and E all can't be the answer.\n11. If we were to consider only the face (1 of 6 options), the face doesn't show a clock's features like the numbers, so option D can't be the choice either.\n12. Therefore, the only", "answer": " 4"}

Choices: 1. A: stop B: a car accident C: when I feel like it D: right now E: when I notice it\nRationales: We need to apply two basic principles to solve this question\n1. What do I feel? (feeling)\n2. What do I actually want (desire)?\nFor the feeling principle, when we say we feel like something, it means we are either experiencing a feeling or there in an objective physical sensation (usually pain) that makes us feel that way. For example, when I feel I have a pain, I get hurt. If I feel thirsty, I am likely to feel so and want to drink something. The same is true when we say we feel lazy at a particular point.\nThe desire principle requires that we do things that are actually desired and avoid things that would not be desirable. It is the mind that directs you to follow your desire.\n\nAnswers:\n\n1. When I have a desire:\n\n2. When I feel like I have a desire: (desire principle)\n\n### Instructions:Read the following statement then respond.\n\n### Statement:\n\n### Your Responses\n\nIn both cases, what we want (desire) is what we actually feel.

{"text": "object, but it is not contained by a doorway and isn't inside the doorway.\n3. Next, we'll check option B: control panel. It's definitely an object that would typically be found in a doorway.\n4. Now, we need to find out if it is contained by a door.\n5. We can eliminate option D: doorknobs. A doorknob by itself is not a control panel, so this doesn't do the trick.\n6. Now, we have to do the same for options C: opening doors and E: doorways.\n7. An opening door is a door, but it is not an object itself - just an opening in the door. So, we can eliminate C: opening doors. But, if the object is contained by the doorway, the opening door can be considered the doorway. Also, since we're solving a question like this by eliminating options sequentially, it's important to use the same order. It's OK if the order isn't exactly as above - the process of elimination works by eliminating options that are clearly inappropriate for the given question.\n8. So, if the object is inside a doorway, then the doorway is the doorway.\n9. This is a somewhat unique use of the term \"doorway\" but it should be fine. If it's not, then you can go the other route and start looking for a suitable option.\n10. At last, we have everything set up to select from the remaining choices - A: control panel and E: doorway.\n11. But let's eliminate E: doorway once more: it is a doorway, but it is also an object containing another object - the door itself - which we are after. We can rule that out.\n12. Now there is no other option available but A: control panel.\n13. The reason why it's impossible to choose E: doorway is because the question's phrasing states we'd grab the object and since we'd grab the door as well.\n14. Thus, A: control panel is the answer.\nAnswer: A. control panel\n\nInput: In which of the following locations would you not play the piano?

Choices: 1.) supervise staff 2.) attend meetings 3.) interview applicants 4.) communicate with customers 5.) take care of personal issues in the office 6.) take breaks\nRationales: We can eliminate 1 and 5. \"Supervising staff\" and \"taking breaks\" refer to actions performed by an office manager. These are not explicitly stated as responsibilities of an office manager, so they can be eliminated. \nRationales: \"Attend meetings\" states that an office manager is required to attend meetings. That means it is not one of the responsibilities of an Office Manager. That does not give us any options. \nRationalises: \"Interview Applicants\" refers to a specific job duty of an office manager, rather than an inherent responsibility of being an office manager. So, it is not an answer. \nRationalisation: \"Communicate with customers\" refers to the way an office manager will communicate with customers. \"Communicate\" is not an inherent responsibility of an office manager. So it is not an answer either. \nRationalision: This option states the responsibilities of a sales manager. That means, this is not the right question. It is related to an office manager. \nRationalization: \"Complete Responsibilities\" states that every manager is required to complete their responsibilities.

We can also eliminate option C: opening doors, as the concept of opening doors applies to a door only. It cannot physically contain an object that is actually being controlled. Option E: Doorway can be further rejected because we are talking about an object being grabbed, when the doorway is a physical feature that we can grab.

You're searching in the rain for your keys that you lost.\n1. The first option (which is \"because they are wet\") refers to the keys that you are actually looking for. Why aren't you looking for this particular key in the rain?\n2. The second option (which is \"them\" referring to the keys) is referring to the keys themselves. Why aren't they getting wet? \n3.

One way to achieve this is try to come up with what each of the choices could signify.\nFrom here on, I think we could get a better idea of what type of product we can expect to see. First, we eliminate B: couch. We do this because couches are generally used to sit rather than to serve any specific purpose or task.

Looking through the remaining options, option B: control panel appears to be the most appropriate choice.\n6. The control panel provides multiple functionalities, including those related to the opening and closing of doors.\n7. The control panel could refer to the physical doors located on an appliance like a refrigerator or oven, and the functionality associated with these doors, or it could apply to a specific door or doors of a building.\n8.

Choices:  A. best B. rest C. dust D. buzzer E. hush\nRationales: The question specifically asks which of the given words rhymes with kissed? 1. None of the given choices are spelled the same as the word kissed. 2. Only two of them, i.e., Best, and Buzzers can be pronounced similarly as kissed. While none of them exactly rhymes with kisses, 'Best' and 'Buzzers' can be understood as 'best' and 'buzzer' when pronounced. 3. There must be an option where the two words can be understood, to be given as an option of the set. 4. Hence, the pair that fits best, in this sense, is 'Best' and 'buzzeeeeeer', the latter being a more appropriate pronunciation. 5. According to this option, we can understand that 'buzzer' rhymes with 'kissed'. 6. That is the right answer.\nAnswer: A. Best. Buzzzer.\n\nInput: Would this question be grammatically correct?

When we say that an object is \"contained\" by a doorway, what does it imply?\n4. It implies that the door is being used to cover or hide part of the doorway area, which contains the object. In other words, this \"object\" would be hidden by the door.\n5. So, for this particular choice, we can first focus on the door choice, and among the given options, it should be the option that covers the least amount of doorway. \n6. That leaves us with E: doorway because the other options will generally cover more of the door frame and leave some of the door frame open, which is the area that will contain the object. For example: option D: door handle, will expose most of the door frame to provide easy access, which will also cover some of the doorway that is directly in front of the door handle.\n7. Moreover, the answer choices that will cover more of the doorway will be the ones that should not be considered first. These are options B: control panel and C: opening doors.\n8.

From the remaining choices, we have to determine how the remaining options relate to the statement. We should choose the one that best matches the given conditions. Based on the context, we can safely eliminate choices C: trunk, because it isn't likely that his signature is in the trunk. \n2. Now, it's between choice A: door panel and choice E: gas cap.

Choices:  C: plumbing center B: plumber E: garage A: garage door D: plumber store\nRationales: Now, there are two ways to solve this. First of all, there is a word in the question that helps us. We are told that these people work with plumbing but that we aren't sure if we want a plumber who handles plumbing or a plumber who works plumbing. 1. This implies that this is actually a question of word-choice, and therefore, we're not asking where plumbers work, but about the kind of plumber we need. 2. We are also given that there is a plumber who could 'help with my toilet'.\n3. So, we are looking for plumbers who can help with a toilet.\n4. Now, which plumber do we want? Do we want the plumber who works plumbers or the plumber who works on plumbing? 5. Well, if we know that a plumber who works on a toilet is able to fix a broken toilet, then we want the one who works on a totoilet. 6. There are only two options who would fit that: E: garage and C: plumber.\n7. Therefore, option C: plumber gets the answer.\nAnswer: C: plumber\n\n## Example: In the above example, we look for plumber who could help me because a) we know the toilet is located in a bathroom b) we know that we are looking for a plumber since we assume the person asking this question wants to fix the toiletor c) we need help because we will probably have to move the toilet\n\n### Instructions:Complete", "answer": " 90"}

This implies options B and C refer to either the door frame itself or openings in its frame, which are both potentially contained by a doorway and would be good options to grab an object from.\n7.

Given the question that is asking us about \"the words Mother and mother\" that can be changed \"by one word.\" \n2. It says \"mother\" but doesn't say \"Mother\".\n3. So the word is \"mother\" which would be different from \"Mother\".\n4.

So this question seems to be a common riddle that is trying to confuse us by wording the question with incorrect details to avoid using common logic. \n6. To figure out the answer, we can use common sense logic to eliminate the unhelpful options.\n7. First, we eliminate the options A: a single word and B: the word, because we need to find words rather than a word. \n8.

Then again, the question makes it clear that the object being grabbed is contained by a door, so the question of grabbing objects that open doorways is already eliminated.\n7, Similarly, option E: doorway isn't required at all to the extent that the doorway is already an object's containment.\n8. The only relevant choices are therefore options B: control panel and C: opening doors.\n9. We can eliminate C since the panel allows us to control the door as well as the door itself. Since we don't know if we're opening the door from the inside or the outside, the panel is an invalid choice.\n10. Moving to option, B: control panel, we can see that panel is used to control the door as opposed to the panel itself.\n11. So, this option isn't valid either.

Choices:  IA: parents B: spouse C: grandparents D: neighbors E: friends\nRationales: The solution to a question requires understanding its premises and logical structure. Given that, we can now proceed with analyzing the question.\n1. This question asks who you would go to if someone were to be in danger.\n2. So this person could be anyone for whom you would help.\n3. Now among the given options, parent, spouse, and grandparent are family members. Friends are individuals with whom one is socially close.\n4. You have to choose the option where you would consider the person you would go to to be in danger. We therefore need to eliminate option C: grandparents.\n5. There's nothing that specifically states you're close or emotionally involved with any of the other options, or that you're in a relationship or friendship with anyone here. But you do feel an obligation for parents and spouses who would most likely be there for you when you need help or are in danger.\n6. Therefore option B: parent and C: spouse are the most appropriate choices here that suit what is being asked for. \n7. So the right answer choice is A: parents.\nAnswer: A : Parents\n\nInput: To who would I have to be talking to if I were in trouble?

If the question asks me to get an object contained by the doorway, I can't grab the doorway itself, so we can eliminate E.\n6. The remaining options are Door Knob D and doorknob E.\n7. The door knob is at the doorway, and so doorknob E is an object that can only be grabbed at the door, and hence eliminating option E.\n8. That leaves us with only option D: doorknobs.\n9. Since a doorknob is on the door, the only way to get an object contained in a doorway is to reach for it.\n10. Therefore, the answer has to be doorknob D.\nAnswer: D:\\: doorknob\n\nInput: To where does the river return? Choices: 1. A2. A3. B4. A5. B6. B7. C8. C9.B10. A\nRationales:1.

The options are A and B, but both can't be right choices because both are the same.\n4. We have to figure out which of the answers B and C is right.\n5. If answer B is right, then C will be the right choice and if C is the right choice, then B must be the right choice.\n6. So, we need to figure out whether B or C is right.\n7. Let's assume that B is correct and that the river is returning to the sea, then, we need to figure whether sea is B or C, that sea is part of A.\n8. If sea was C, then A was right answer and nothing is the same as the other choices, and then the answer is not B or C, but A is the answer.\n9. Otherwise, sea will be B and the river is returning to lake, then", "answer": " 49"}

Similarly, we can also eliminate option B: control panel, since the doorway does not include the door itself and, furthermore, an electronic panel of any kind (like the control panel of a car or a phone) does not fit very naturally in a doorway in the same way that the other objects in the question do.\n4. Option C: opening doors, by which the question means \"doors that are open\", implies that the object we are looking for has an open door where it resides, but this cannot be the same doorway referred to in the question. \n5. There should be no doors open on the same side of the doorway as the control panel or the television. Therefore, we can eliminate option C: Opening doors.\n6.

We are left with options B: control panel, C: opening doors, and B: control panel.\n6. Of these, it is clear from the question that we can't grab the doorway, so option E: doorway can be ruled out.\n7.

These time choices correspond with a possible schedule/plan for how to get from one place to another.\n8.

This leaves us with three options (C, D and E): Opening doors (C), Doorknob (D) and Doorway (E).\n6. This means that we can eliminate option C: Opening doors since the door is not the object itself. We're looking for the actual object here, not simply the opening made by the door.\n7. Option (D) Doorknob is also excluded because it isn't something that we're going to grab or hold to ourselves.

We must start by eliminating the improbable option: P looked outside, at the street, for a sign?\n3. We also need to eliminate N is false, because the woman, is finding a place to sleep, not for dinner, so she needs to look at her display to look for a place to sleep, the display is the woman's smartphone.\n4. Since no woman would drive a bus to a rest stop, L is very unlikely.\n5. If this was something easy like a hotel, the woman wouldn't need to look at a sign, so M, is incorrect.\n6.

While \"similarities\" between colors can be very subtle, we can make a judgment based on their appearance when compared side by side.\n4. Thus, we can eliminate options that describe colors as belonging to different groups.\n5. So when we compare peach and indigo, it's clear that the colors do not belong to the same group.\n6. So peach and indigo can be eliminated. \n7. Let's compare viola and violet. Violet looks like a more reddish version of violet. But there is some slight indifference between the two colors. \n8. Therefore, we can eliminate violet for similarities.\n9. Let's compare peach and magenta. Clearly, these are not the same color.\n10. So, magenta can be excluded. \n11.

Option B: control panel, is a control device found on trains which would likely have a doorway surrounding it, but control panels aren't typically 'grabbed' in the manner asked in the question.\n4. Option C: opening doors, also doesn't directly refer to a 'grab' motion, as a person opens doors using their hands and arms, rather than grabbing it.\n5. Similarly, option D: doorknobs, refers to a knob that is operated with the right hand or a knob that is held after it is pulled to open the door. Neither of these are a grab motion, hence it can be eliminated as well.\n6. That leaves us with 3 remaining options of E, D and E.\n7. E: doorway, refers to something that consists of a door. As you can't grab parts of a door, option E can be eliminated. \n8. D: door handles are objects in doorways that you can hold onto.

Choices:  Warm up his lungs by climbing a hill A: pant B: run C: breath in D: gasp E: take a break\nRationales: Looking at the answer choices, the only possible answer is D: gasp.\n1. The hunter 'panted' to warm up his lungs, not to find wildlife.\n2. He did not 'run' for the wildlife, as this was a hunting expedition.\n3. 'Blowing air in his lungs', in other words, 'breathing in,' also wouldn't give him any advantage over finding wildlife.\n4. Option E 'taking a break' does not help him locate wildlife either, rather the opposite.\n5. Therefore the only viable answer is D: gap.\n6. Therefore the only viabel answer is D. gasp.\n7.

Choices: a: remind us of the time b: change our perspective c: give us a choice d: get our attention e: look at the wrong thing\nRationales: Reasoning Steps 1. The question asked us to identify the idea that thinking, \"what should have been done differently,\" refers to.\n2. Options B, C, D, and E all provide potential answers of what changing, giving us a choice, or getting our attention might be referring to.\n3. We can eliminate option A and B, as they provide different answers from the ones the question provided choices for.\n4. Option C tells us that it \"changed our perspective,\" which implies that there was something done once the action that was undesirable happened instead, and we were able to view the action from a different perspective. \n5. Option D tells us that there was something done differently once the action was undesirable, thereby changing what was done.\n6. Therefore the answer is either C or D.\n7. If we choose option A, we can then choose between two answers: if we were to have chosen the wrong thing, our perspective would have changed, or we would have gained perspective by making a choice.\n8. We must evaluate both options and evaluate what they tell us about thinking what should have been done.\n9. We are told that choosing the wrong thing could have changed our perspective, which tells us that the act of having gained perspective is the change that occurs when we choose the wrong thing.\n10. This tells us that we are left with the first option whereby if we were to have done something else, having done something differently would have changed how we perceive the action.\n11. Therefore, the answer to this is C or D.\n12. If we choose D: getting our attention, we", "answer": " 78"}

Moving to option D: doorknub, a doorknub is actually not an object but a tool we use in order to operate the door.\n4. It is the point where we would put our hand on in order to operate the opening mechanism of the door.\n5. Doorknubs are never inside doors. We find them on the outside, and not inside, of doors.\n6. Therefore this is the incorrect answer, and we need to eliminate it.\n7. The question then asks about a doorway. A doorway is a set of two door handles which open a door.\n8. Therefore option E: doorway is the correct answer\n9. You would therefore grab an object that is (for example) on a table from behind the doorway. You would grasp it, push the door open, and take the object out.\nAnswer: E - doorway\n\nInput: We were trying to locate a specific tree in the forest, where would we walk? Choices: 1. A: a roadway 2. B: down the street 3. C: the trail 4. D: to the backyard 5. E: to the wooded path\nRationales: There are multiple rationales to understand this question.\n1. The question is describing a scenario where we are looking for a specific tree in a forest.\n2. Since we are looking for a particular tree we are aware of its location (since we can see it)\n3. Once we identify its location we can start looking for it, i.e., walk down the road to get to it\n4. Hence the logical choice would be C: the Trail because we are looking for a tree which is in a specific location.\n5. We want to go down a trail (to locate the tree).\n6.

So, the only options left are options D: doorknobs and E: doorways. \n5. Option E: doorways would not hold an object, since doorways are empty spaces and have no properties that indicate they could 'contain' anything. \n6. But option D: doorknibs are the only remaining option here. \n7. A doorknob is a mechanical component that controls the opening and closing of a door, and it typically is designed to be gripped by a human hand. \n8. Therefore, option D is the correct answer here.\nAnswer: D Doorknob\n\nInput: Where may you find a water fountain? Choices:  Option A: city Option B: mall Option C: museum Option D: bookshelf Option E: bathroom\nRationales:\n1. Water fountains can be found in public spaces, such as parks, city squares, and other outdoor locations.\n2. They may be found in malls as well, especially in food courts or near food vendors, as a place to cool off and refill one's water bottle.\n3. Water fountains are also commonly found in museums, as they are often designed as part of the architectural or thematic d\u00e9cor for the space.\n4. Some school buildings, such as universities or secondary schools, may have water fountains for students and staff, although not all schools have them and some buildings do not have any.\n5.

Option C: opening doors, doesn't really make sense, as opening a door would require that the object is initially contained by the door.\n6. Option D: doorknobs, make a tiny amount of sense as you might be holding onto a doorknob to hold open a door before you grab whatever it is you're holding with the other hand.

Choices:  H: sleeping, I: reading, J: eating, K: cleaning, L: taking a rest\nRationales: In this question, the baby's crying has stopped hence we need to figure out what the mother was doing.\n1. A good thing to do is to eliminate out the least likely options.\n2. In this case, option L: taking a rest, which is the least likely as taking rest is optional while reading, eating, sleeping, and cleaning are not.\n3. Moving to option C: sleeping, it's quite likely that the mother stopped crying and went to sleep because it may likely increase the baby's quietness. \n4. Similarly, if the baby was hungry it's likely that option B: eating. \n5. Likewise, option D: cleaning makes sense as crying kids usually cause more mess. \n6. That is, it's more likely that the mother stopped doing any of these four actions and went back to doing it so that the baby stops crying.\n7. In the end, the most likely answer is J: eating, therefore is the correct answer.

B: number of people could be referring to the number of people in the room who are babies, but it is most likely to refer to the total number of people present in the room, including adults and babies.\n1. D: the number of the people is more likely to refer to the number of people as a whole, i.e. the number of both babies and adults, as opposed to the number of people who are babies. So this is most likely to be the correct answer.\n2. Taking D into consideration, C would actually be an incorrect answer, as C is referring to the number of babes in the room.\n3. Hence, it is most likely that C is referring to the total number of adults present in the room.\n4.

It would be unlikely that you actually grab an object that is already by your doorway.\n4. We can eliminate option C: control panel, as a control panel generally is not a physical object you can grab. \n5. Next, option B: door knob, should be eliminated. By definition, a door knob is what you use to open the door or close it. So, we do not need to grab it by the door.\n6. We can eliminate option D: doorknobs, as it is incorrect grammar. Additionally, door knobs are a single object and, in this context, the term generally refers to a single single. \n7. So, this implies option E: doorway cannot be the correct answer and we can move to the next option.\n8. Option E: doorway actually can be the correct answer. By the time you get to the doorway, your door is already open. And you, the human, cannot be contained by your door (unless you are in a container within a container or something).\n9. So, we can discard option B: door knobs and option D: door knobs as they are incorrect grammar and are not what we need.\n10. We can also eliminate option E: doorways.

It isn't related to meaning A: crankle, which means to wrinkle, ruffle, or fret.\nSecond, eliminate E: crinkle, since the question implies that both should have the same meaning, a synonym.

Choices:  Choices:  A B C (none of these)\nRationales:\n1. The question talke about how likely it would be for cows to cross a path in order to reach a pasture.\n2. Since the cows are specifically seeking pastures, their actions are more likely to be guided by their goal of reaching their destination than by the nature of the terrain that they have to cross.\n3. In other words, while factors such as the ease of travel or the presence of obstacles could influence a cow's decision to cross a path, these would be secondary considerations that might not play a major role in determining their choice.\n4. Therefore \"None of these\" is the most appropriate answer to the question.\n5. Since no choice is a specific type of terrain, we would assume that a cow is willing to traverse any terrain to reach its goal.\n6. Cows are also known to be docile animals, prone to following the herd and responding to the general mood or behavior of the group.\n7. So, all four choices would still be likely choices for a cow.\n8. Therefore the most appropriate choice is (none of these).\nAnswer: A: none of these\n\nInput: How can a person look for something without a sense of visual imagery?

Option B: control panel, option C: opening doors, and option D: doorknobs are also incorrect as they are not objects contained by doorways.\n4. The key to solving this is to find an object that would be contained by the doorway and that can be grabbed.\n5. Out of the given options, the only one that would fit is E: doorway, which is a doorway itself.\n6. Therefore option E is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B)Doorway\n\nInput: What must the boy's parents not have? Choices: \nA: ice cream B: milk C: orange juice D: a cake E: water\nRationales:\n1. First, we have to be careful in selecting the correct part of speech. Because \u201cmust\u201d is used as an auxiliary verb the answer may consist only of one word.\n2. The first thing to do is to identify what kind of mistake the answer does.\n3. The answer does not involve the main subject or focus of the paragraph. \u201cWhat must the boy\u2019s parents not have?\u201d is a grammatical question, the answer is not essential.\n4. The answer must be a question word. \u201cWhat must the boys parents not have?\u201d the answer is a grammatical structure, not a part of speech.\n5. Therefore The boy\u2019s parents cannot have any question words for the response.\n6. The next thing to do is to find a pattern.\n7. \u201cThe boy\u2019s parents\u201d is the subject \u201ca must not have\u201d. \u201ca must not have\u201d is the main verb the question will answer.\n8. The answer will consist of the subject, the verb and some optional prepositions or modifiers.\n9. The answer we can form is B: \"What mustn't the boy's parents have?\" The answer has the correct parts of speech and the grammatical structure.\n10. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cThe boy\u2019s parent\u2019s must not have anything.\u201d\nAnswer: C: \"The boy\u2019s parent's must not have anything.\"\n\nInput: Which number of people would you say your father would like to take to lunch?

In this case, the appliances doors can be opened or closed, but the control panel remains the same. Thus, we can eliminate B: control panel.\n4. Similarly, we can eliminate options C: opening doors, E: doorway, as the question clearly states that the question refers only to an object 'within' a doorway.\n5. We can also eliminate option D: doorknobs, because they are not contained within a door. Doorknobs are only parts of any given door and are not actually in the door.\n6.

A: Needle 2. B: car accident 3. C: fire\n Rationales: 1) The first scenario described is finding a needle in a stack of hay. This is because the hay is large and randomized. Even if you knew what a needle looked like, you would only be scanning through a limited area to find it.\n2) The second scenario described is finding a car accident. This is because the car accident itself is contained in a confined area. You know where it is. So it is much easier to find it in that confined space\n3) The third scenario described is finding a fire. This is because the fire itself is large and randomized, and it can also change location unexpectedly. It is a large and difficult target to track, much harder than the needle in a hay stack.\nAnswer: B. Car Accident\n\nInput: When do I get home after I finish work?

{"text": "object, but it's outside the doorway.\n3. Next, we can eliminate option C: The opening doors.\n4. This option is a bit vague. A doorway can have one, two or possibly even more openings. So, the whole concept doesn't refer to a particular kind of action or object.\n5. Also, this is not where you would grab an object that was being held by the doorway. It's the part we could refer to as the door frame.\n6. So it's safe to eliminate option C.\n7. Moving to options D: doorknobs and E: doorways, we can ask ourselves to remember what the question was asking. It was to answer where you would grab, not what.\n8. And there's no need to grab a doorknob, as that would be unnecessary. It's there to facilitate opening the door.\n9. However, what you might do is grab the door, or the doorway itself. We can then consider option E: doorway again.\n10. However, this question does not really include grabbing the doorway or the door itself. It states that we should grab the object 'contained in' by the doorway.\n11. Objects are in a container or contained while their presence can be felt. So it's the contained nature of the object we're trying to grasp in the doorway.\n\nSo the answer is the object contained by the doorway. Which is not door itself just yet.\n12. We have a bunch of choices, but most of them are just describing objects.\n\nThe only option that includes both the physical action of grabbing and a contained object is option B: control panel.\n13. Since the question was asking for actions, like grabbing, we get the answer as B: control panel. \nAnswer: B: control panel\n\nInput: What are the four major categories of living things classified as?

We also can eliminate option B: control panel, as it is not an object contained in the doorway, but an object that is placed somewhere within a doorway to control its functions.\n4. Also, option C: opening doors can be eliminated too, as it would be the opening to the door and not the door itself.\n5. So, we are left with options D: doorknobs and E: doorways.\n6. Now, doorknobs are parts of doors, not their whole selves. You can grab a doorknob, sure, but if a doorknock is the object required, then it is only found inside a doorway and not the entire thing.\n7. So, our choice is limited to option E: doorways. Thus, the answer should be choice E.\nAnswer: E. Doorways.\n\nInput: What are you looking at? Choices: \tA: your eyes B: your nose C: your tongue D: your palm E: your chest\nRationales: First, we should determine what the word \"at\" could mean here.\n1. The word \"at\" could be a preposition, in which case it would help determine which of the following choices is the object of the preposition \"at\". \n2. The other option would be to consider it an interrogative pronoun, in which case it could mean \"what do you see/what object is directly in front of your eyes?\" \n3. Looking at the given options, choice D: your palm is an option that can be directly in front of your face (for example, in the case of one of your hands). \n4. Therefore, choice D: your pelm could be the object of the prepositon \"at\". \n5. Choices A: your eyes, B: your nose, and C: your tongue all lie within the cavity of your mouth and can only be seen directly in front of your mouth when your face is close proximity to yours. \n6. So, the given answers \"A: your eyes, B. your nose, C: your tongue\" are not the most obvious candidates for the object of the prepostion. Only choice D: your palms is suitable.\n7.

Moving to option A: C, it appears as if the person is looking inside a doorway. This implies that objects are contained by the doorway, which contradicts the title of the question.\n4. Option B: Control panel also appears to indicate an object is contained by a door. However, the control panel does not refer to a doorway, but to an electronic device that operates with a user interface.\n5. Similar to option A: control panel, option D: doorknobs indicate objects are contained by the given door. This conflicts with what is asked in the question.\n6. Therefore the answer should remain with D: doorknab,\n7. This is the option that represents the most reasonable sense of what the question appears to describe. It is also the only one that does not seem too specific.\n8. Since we can grab the doorknob from a door, it makes sense to find the doorknob within a doorway. Moreover, the option C: opening doors seems like a more specific choice than the others. Yet, it does not provide the information needed to solve the question.\n9. The reason is that the question doesn't specify how the person would need to use the doorknob to grab an object. It only asks where the doorknob should be found. The choice doesn't give us any additional information, making it unnecessary to include it in the choices.\n10. Besides, the doorknob is already a defined entity, so the person does not need to find it, but rather reach for it.\n11.

This leaves us with options C and A as the best answer and so the answer would be A: doorway.\n7.

We can eliminate option B: control panel too. This is a door control element, so not a doorway.\n4. Now we need to work from a list of doorway containments, which are: opening doors, doorknob, and doorway itself. Opening doors is not really an option, as the object would come out and would not be located inside the doorway.\n5. So now we are left with doorknob and doorway alone.\n6. But the word contained, implies that we have more than one option.\n7. If we were to grab this object out of the doorway we'd need to pull or bend it first and then grab it. This would be a possible action only if it was contained inside the doorway, as it would be located outside the doorway unless it's some magical object.\n8. Hence, the answer would be option D: doorknobs. They're inside the doorway, so we could grab them easily.\nAnswer: D. Doorknobs\n\nInput: When would you find flies in an apartment? Choices: 1.

And the other items mentioned would be found elsewhere.\n\nStep 4: The only item that would be found at the doorway is 'door-way'. Hence, the most likely item would be B (garage).\n\nStep 5: Option A (elevator), however, is the most likely option if 'door-way' is ignored. \n```\n\nAnswer: B: Garage\n\n```\nStep1: The question is asking about which of these can be found at a garage.\n\nStep2: We should remember that a garage is a storage room for cars or things related to it.

Option C: opening doors would require you to open the doors to grab an object, so this can be eliminated as well. \n6. Option D: doorknobs are just handles for opening a door. So that can be eliminated. However, the term could be used loosely in certain scenarios like: \"I grabbed the doorknob on the bathroom door and pulled it.\" The doorknob can be a lever that you can use to pull the door, so in that case, it could apply to the open door. \n7.

Choices:  E: no energy G: a whole lot of energy\nRationales: First, the question asks where and how much energy an object has? \nNext, we notice in the choices offered as options, we have E: no energy and G: a whole lot. \nThat's a range from -ve infinity to +ve infinity. \nThere's no such thing as negative (+ve) or positive energy on this earth. \nEnergy doesn't have any kind to do with direction or movement. \nEnergetically, something can be moving in a straight line. \nIf the object is moving and you use force to stop the object, you have energy. \nIf you place the object on the ground and pick it up again, you have energy. No positive or negative energy. \nSince the range is from -ve infinity to  +ve infinity, the only answers that would be incorrect are E: no energy and A: a lot. A lot of energy is defined as positive energy.

This leaves us with options B: control panel, C: opening doors, and C: opening doors. Both B: controls panels and C: opening doors are objects that are within, or related to, a doorway. \n6. However, a panel controls the door, and not the doorway itself. So, we can eliminate option C: opening doors. \n7. So, to grab an object contained by the doorway, we can either grab an object contained by or related to the doorway. Both of these choices can be used interchangeably here.\n8. Also, we know that doorways are meant exclusively for passing through, and not for storing anything. So, it stands to reason that we would only use the doorway to grab objects that we cannot necessarily reach through a normal door.\n9. The question is then asking about what we would grab that is contained by the doorway. \n10.

For example, while one door might contain a desk, another might contain pictures or a TV set.\n6. Therefore option E: doorway could also be eliminated, as it describes a place that does not exist for all objects contained by a door.\n7. Now, looking at the remaining options, we know that an object has to be contained by a door, and therefore \"control panel\", \"doorknob\" and \"doormat\" can be ruled out.\n8. From the remaining options, \"control panel\" implies that the object is used to control a door in some way.\n9. An object contained by a door is typically used to interact with the door, but it does not necessarily have to be used to control it, and this control can be performed by someone else or through mechanical devices.\n10.

Therefore, option A which suggests that you pick up an item from a bed is not a suitable option because you would need to move the item into the doorway, and then into your hands. Similarly, option C is not a suitable option as you would require the chair to be pushed aside to retrieve the item. Therefore, we can eliminate these two options.\n\nThis leaves us with Option D, which asks, 'is there a place you could place your hat that if the weather gets hot enough, you can sweat on your head?' This question makes sense because a person will sweat on their head when the weather is hot enough and there is no other place to put the hat.\n\nAnswer: D: doorway\n\nInput - Where is it likely a person is most frustrated, and why?

We can also eliminate option C: opening doors, since this refers to the entire collection of action to open a door, not a single point on the door in which we would grab an object.\n4. Finally, option D: doorknobs are often used for opening a door, but they do not refer to a specific point on the door from which an object could be grasped.\n5. This leaves us with questions about option E: doorway, which is a location, not an object.

B: in the middle of the city 3. C: on the side of the road 4. D: on the trail to the parking lot 5. E: under an upside down umbrella\nRationales: For the first question, we need only to consider the options that are related to walking because of the context in the sentence 'The students walked'. The remaining options are 'on the side of the road, 'on the trail to the parkin lot', and 'under an upside down umberella'. Of these three options, we would select the option with the phrase 'on the....' in it since the context of walking implies that walking is the relevant activity.\nFor the second question, since the question refers to 'your friends' specifically, options A and E are out of the question and we are left with options B, C and D. If the context of walking is still in effect, options B and C would be eliminated since the context of the question and the answer have no connection.

We also don't mention what kind of object we want to grab, whether it's a small object, a large one, or anything in between. \n5. The options D: Doorknob and E: Doorway aren't very helpful. The doorknob doesn't indicate which door, so we can't assume which doorway it's contained within.\n6. Also, a doorway doesn't really indicate any kind of containee, unless it's being used to refer to a person or an animal that can be held behind a closed door.\n7. So, all we can really say from the clues is that we want to grab an object that is \"contained by a doorway.\"\n8. If we are holding one of several options, and are allowed to choose between them, we need to pick the choice that will allow us to most easily grab the object. That's what the word contained here is referring to. If you want to grab an object contained with in something, there's a much higher chance of you picking it up if you reach into the contained area rather than reach outside of it. \n9. Therefore, the option that refers to the thing we want to grab must be the one that indicates which area we're actually reaching in to grab it from, making choice C: the opening doors, the correct answer.\n10.

Option C: \"opening doors\", similarly, refers to how we would open a door, and not how the object \"contained\" within the doorway itself.\n5. Option D: \"doorknob\", is the only choice that seems to be a candidate, as a doorknob is the part of the door that we grab to open it. However, when we take a closer look, we can see that options D: Doorknob does not contain the object within the doorway, but that it moves the actual door itself.\n6.

We can also eliminate option B: control panel, as it does not sound like an object that is contained in specific doorways.\n4. Option C: opening doors is not a specific object, as it simply means opening the door.\n5. Option D: doorknobs does sound like a suitable option - it is a small yet important object that is contained by doorways. Additionally, it is a commonly used option for people to grab objects contained in a doorway.\n6. Lastly, option E: doorway is not an object that people tend to grab, but it could be the location where we might grab an object contained in a doorway, such as in doorways that might lead to other rooms or other areas.\n7.

Choices:  - A: Dictionary - B: dictionary - C: dictionary - D: dictionary - E: dictionary\nRationales:1. The question asks us to choose a word that would be found in a dictionary.\n2. The question then follows this up with 5 different words, all of which would be found in a formal dictionary.\n3. However, some of these words cannot be found in a dictionary:\n  * A: Dictionary: Although this word could be found in a casual dictionary, it cannot be found in a formal, academic dictionary.\n  * D: Dictionary: The prefix 'de' means away or downwards. By using 'de', this makes the word sound casual and informal. It should not be found in an academic dictionary.\n\n4. This leaves us with 3 words: B, C, E.\n5. B and C both refer to a dictionary, and E refers to the dictionary itself. Therefore, any of these are appropriate answers.\n6. We can then remove A and D, keeping B, C, and E.\n7. B and C are both in the form - 'dictionary', but both mean slightly different things.\n8. Therefore:\n    * C: dictionary\n    * B: dictionary\n9.

From remaining options, Option D: doorknobs is an object, but the question asks to grab something that the person is in a doorway, hence it is not the correct option. \n4. Option B: control panel is not an object physically contained within a doorway, so this is also a poor choice. \n5. Option E: \"doorway\" is a name of the physical place where the object could be contained. However, this is not a \"doorway\" in the sense of the question but rather a name of the place where we could get to the doorway, so thus it is not the right answer and is also wrong from definition of the question. \n6. This means there is only one answer left, which is option C: \"opening doors\".\n7. While the question asked us to grab an object that is located in a doorway and option C refers to door itself, the word \"grab\" refers to action of grabbing an object with the hand/s. In this sentence, the word \"object\" is not referring to the door itself but rather the object contained \"within\" the door itself.\n8.

For instance, if a person walks into a room with a doorknob and grabs it, they haven't necessarily grabbed an object contained by a certain doorway.\n4. Option B is an item contained by a doorway but it doesn't specify the location of the grab, just the item contained by the doorway.\n5. Option E, Doorway, is the correct answer to this question as it directly answers the question asked.\n6.

Choices: \tA: back yard B: front yard C: back porch D: cranny E: safe room\nRationales:\n1. We want to find the answer that is the best place to feel safe. Therefore let's start by eliminating options that are unlikely to be safe. The first thing we will look at is the option F: back yard. Back yards are places for people to play games such as baseball or to swim. These activities are unlikely to make a person feel safe. We also eliminate the options that are crannies, such as the option G: cranny. The location of a cranny is too remote from a likely place for people to be, making it not a likely place to feel safe.\n2. One of the main considerations in being safe is how close a place is to an exit path. The front yard is where the family usually enters the house and thus has an exit door.\n3. The last option, option J: safe room, is the best answer. It is a room specifically located in the house for this purpose, which is the most practical arrangement for a place to feel safe. It is more likely to contain useful items, such as a flashlight in case of an emergency.\nAnswer: \tJ: safe room\n\nInput: While watching the", "answer": " 15"}

There are too many options available for the answer. However, we can make a hypothesis that the desired item is something the boy is passionate about and that the missing word would fit with this hypothesis. So, the option that fits well with this hypothesis is C. boulder, which is not there. So the choice is C.\nAnswer: C. boulder\n\nInput: If you were making a movie, and you had to include an explosion, where could you find the explosives?

When it comes to explosions, people think of a bomb, which is an explosive. We know that we need explosives so now the trick is just making a link between the options. We can exclude option A, which is a bomb. We also know that we need explosive devices and we know that guns have explosives in them. So we can eliminate option B - guns. Now, option C is a mine. A mine could easily explode, and we also know that they're underground. Therefore, we can eliminate option D - an underground mine. Option", "answer": " 220"}

We next look at the different aspects of doorways, and identify that the choices are: \n4. door, which is a simple closed passageway,\n5. control panel, which is typically a device or feature within a closed door or in front of it,\n6. opening doors to a doorframe, which is a rectangular bar fixed to one or both of ends of a door that helps to hold the door and keep it closed,\n7. doorknobs, which are used to open and close a door, and\n8. doorway, which is a covered way between two doors.\n9. Now, if we were looking to grab an object that is inside the doorway, we can eliminate options C and E which are outside the doorway, and in this case would not be considered part of the doorway.\n10. Also, option B: control panel, can be eliminated, since in this part of the question we are looking for an object which will be moved when the door is closed. \n11. A control panel could be any fixed feature within a closed door, which does not necessarily fit this criterion.\n12. However, we can still eliminate option D: \"doorknob\" from the consideration, as it is in fact the specific part of a door that is used to open or close a door.

As with all logic questions, the answer choices should be thought of as either TRUE or FALSE.\n3. For example, pizza is eaten by the sink. The correct answer is the location where someone is eating their PIZZA by the SINK. \n4. This means it cannot be X: Bathroom because the answer location is a sink. There is no sink in the bathroom. \n5. Thus, we can eliminate one answer. \n6. Next, we need to answer question 2 where we identify which answer is FALSE. The answer choices are as follows:\n7. It cannot be Z: Living room because Z: living room is NOT where someone is EATING their pizza by the SINK, which makes it FALSE. \n8. Now, we can eliminate Z.

Thus, the question does not refer to these possibilities.\n4. The last three options that we have left now are control panel, C: opening doors and E: doorway.\n5. Among the last three options, E: doorway is the only valid one. The phrase \"doorway\" in option E does not refer to the door itself but to the way inside of a door (for example, the hollow space inside a door) which could then accommodate an object that someone might wish to grab or touch.\n6. Option D is incorrect as \"doors\" refer to the entire structure of a door and not to the hollow space inside it. Thus, option D: doorknobb is inappropriate.\n7. Option C: opening doors is also incorrect. A door is something that can open or close and this does not relate to the scenario of a person grabbing an object from inside a hollow space in the door.

Option C: Opening Doors, would be something like a key that you would use to open it.\n5. However, the key would still be inside the doorways, so there would be no place inside to grab it with.\n6. The same can be said for option D: Doorknob. You could grab the doorknob to turn the handle, but that just means touching the outside of the doorknob, not the inside of a doorway itself.\n7.

Choices:  C: Grand Teton National Park A: Mount Olympus B: Mount McKinley C: Mount Everest\nRationales: First, we need to break the question in to parts for the answer: 1. How would you go skiing 2. where would you go skiing.\n1. Skiing does not indicate any particular form of transportation to get there. So we are left with, \"How would you go skiing?\" \n2. So lets look at where would you go ski? Since the question mentions mountains, and there are no other mountains except these five, we can eliminate option C: Grand Teton.\n3. Also option E: Mount Everest is the tallest mountain out of the options and skiing does not imply hiking (unless it's on a treadmill). So, it is unlikely that you'll be skiing here.\n4. Therefore our options left are A: Mount Olympus and B: Mount McKinney.\n5. Mount Olympus is the highest mountain in America. So it fits better for that option.\n6. Therefore the answer is B: Mount Mackinney.\nAnswer: B, Mount Mackinney\n\nInput: How long does it take to walk from Chicago to L.A.?

Choices:  C: spider and banana A: boy and spider B: banana and spider D: spider and boy\nRationales: The question asks what the boy with the spiders ate and it gives us information that it was probably fruits of some kind. The question is ambiguous because there is a spider that's eating the fruit and a boy who is eating the spider. \n1. Looking at the fruits, there aren't any other kinds of fruit except a banana that might eat the spider.\n2. The other fruits are not an accurate description of a fruit that's eaten by animals generally. \n3. So, the answer is D: spider and the boy.\n4.

We can also eliminate options B: control panel, and C: opening doors, since neither terms make any reference to objects being contained.\n4. What remains are D: doorknobs and E: doorways.\n5. The correct answer has to do specifically with objects \"contained\" by doorways, so we can cross off doors, since doorways are not containers.\n6. The only remaining option is E: doorway.\n7.

Choices:  G: 80% A: 40% B: 20% C: 3 out of 5 D: more than 3 out of 4\nRationales: The problem asks what the chances of fun when we go outdoors, provided that we meet friends.\n1. We understand the task to be asking what is the probability of fun when we meet friends and also go outdoors.\n2. Out of the choices, we can easily eliminate C: 3 out 5 and D: more than 4 of 5 since, in these options, fun appears to be dependent on the number of friends we see.\n3. In C: 3 out out-of-5, even if we saw a lot of friends, such as five, as long as we met three, it would be deemed fun.\n4. In D: more than 0f 4, it is only fun if we see at least four friends, as long as we see enough to equal or exceed 40 percent. \n5. Therefore, both C: 3 out-of-5 and D: more-than-of 4 can be eliminated as they are dependent on a pre-established fraction.\n6. This leaves us with options A: 40 percent and B: 20.\n7. The answer can be determined by finding the sum that satisfies both: \"outdoors\" and \"when we meet friends\".\n8. Let's consider these terms separately.\n9.

Option B, control panel, may be a component of doorway but it is not typically something that is contained by a home's doorway. This eliminates option B: control panel.\n4. We already eliminated option D: doorknobs in question B as they are not \"contained\" within the doorway, as they are attached or removed from the door, but they are still relevant to the question as a type of handle or grip. The same goes for option E: doorway, which can also be a type of grip but is irrelevant to this given scenario.\n5.

Choices: 1. A: working at home 2. B: working on time 3. C: working on the job 4. D: working with the company 5. E: working with a machine\nRationales:  1. First, the phrase \"working in the afternoon on Thrusday\" contains the answer to the question.\n2. Second, we can identify that \"working\" is a verb, and that the answer must be a noun of the same type.\n3. The choices are either a noun or an adjective (in which case the phrase \"working on...\" would be used rather than \"working...\"), so option B is an adjective.\n4. \"Working with machine\" refers to the co-operation between people.\n5. \"Working with a company\" means working with the company to the extent of your position.\n6. Thus, \"working\" should be something performed at work, or a person's occupation. Therefore, E: working with a company, and C: working on the Job, are wrong.\n7. \"In the afternoon\" refers to a specific time of the day, therefore, option A: working at home, and D: working with the Company are out.\n8. This leaves B: working on time, and E: working with a Machine.\n9. So, Option E is the correct answer because, working with a machine is a specific type", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": "object kept on a shelf or a flat surface.\n3. Option B: control panel is again an object kept on a flat surface. It is typically located inside the doorway itself.\n4. Option D: doorknobs is an object which is fixed on the doorframe and is typically not used to contain another object.\n5. When an object is contained by a doorframe, it typically means it is confined by a certain set of parameters. \n6. Usually, it is the area below or above the door, also referred to as the \"doorway\" in some contexts.\n7. So, we can eliminate options C: opening doors and D: doorknobile, since if they are contained by the doorway, then by definition they aren't objects on their own.\n8. Given that we can eliminate four options, we can infer that only two options are relevant in the context of the given problem: E: doorway and option that's related to that. \n9. Therefore, the answer to the given question is E: doorway.\nAnswer: E, doorway\n\nInput: What might you say to a friend who is hungry to tell them where the food is? Choices:  a) Let's go get it. b) It's right down the street. c) In the kitchen. d) It's at the house. e) It's across the dining room table.\nRationales: First, the question asks for the possible thing one might say to a friend who was famished and wanted to know where the food was. \nTherefore, to get the correct answer, we should try to choose the one that best matches the scenario the question presents. \nFor this, we can eliminate options d) It's a t the house and b) It's at least down the street. \nThese options mean that the food is not in the house but in another house or somewhere else. \nSo, these choices do not match the current scenario of the question. \nFor the remaining options, it is important to consider which words might match the scenario of a person being very hungry and wanting to know where the food is. \nWe could consider that this person might be a child and looking through this perspective, it is possible that they might be trying to go get the food themselves. \nIn this scenario, they might ask", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "item that isn't contained by a doorway, and not necessarily contained by a specific doorway either.\n3. Now let's look at option B: control panels. This is the type of thing that is typically placed inside the doorway of some appliance or machine \u2014 like a computer or ATM. But, the control panel could be contained by the doorway of many different doorways, depending on the machine.\n4. Moving to option C: doors. This is the obvious answer candidate. The opening is the door of the doorway, and the doorway is usually where the actual door is located.\n5. However, we can eliminate this option too as we do not know which specific doorway is in question. \n6. In fact, it could even be a doorway to another doorway \u2014 one which could lead us on a long journey to reach a specific item \u2014 or it could be a doorway in its own right. It is only a doorway to a doorway, not the item we are after.\n7. So we can also eliminate option D: doorknobs, as they are not contained by the doorway.\n8. We are left with option E: doorway. This seems to be the correct option, as we can usually reach something contained by a doorway by walking through the doorway.\n9. This makes sense because of our previous discussion about how a doorway may or may not be contained by a particular door \u2014 a door that is in turn contained by another door.\n10. For instance. A person may enter a house through the front door, containing a door that is itself contained by a door to another doorway. If such a door contained an item wanted, the item would be contained by both the door that contained the door, and the door or doorway itself.\n11. Thus, we can conclude that the correct answer is option E: doorway, since we can generally reach something (usually an item) contained by a door by walking through the door.\nAnswer: E : doorway\n\nInput: In a sentence, what may a quote be from?

Thus, from the choices given we can infer that E is the correct answer.\nAnswer: Choice E: doorway\n\nInput: In which state would be the best location for the house that you have been trying to sell? Choices:  a: Ohio b: New Jersey  c: Montana  d: Florida e: Tennessee\nRationales:\n1. To answer a question like this we need to first understand what the options represent.\n2. \"Ohio\" is usually associated with the Midwest region of the US. \"New Jersey\" is to the north-east of the US and is often included in the northeastern states. \"Montana\" is a western state of the US and is a part of the South Western group of states. \"Florida\" is a southern region of the US bordering the Gulf of Mexico, and \"Tennessee\" also borders the southern part of the US, on the eastern side.\n3. Therefore we can assume that the options represent the general region or parts of the US. \n4. As per the question, we need to pick the state in which building the house would be the best location. \n5. Among the given options, only \"Florida\" comes in the south-east part of the US, which is what we are looking for. \n6.

Now, looking at the choice that remains, option D: doorknobs,  this is a part of an object, in this case, a door.\n4. However, a doorknob is an attachment to the outside of the door, not the door itself.\n5. The handle is attached to the door itself.\n6. So, while our position might be indicated as being 'handing a doorknob', the doorknob itself is not contained by a 'doorway'.\n7. Therefore, we can eliminate option D: doorknoid.\n8.

{"text": "inanimate object and is not contained by a doorway to be grabbed.\n3. Similarly, option B: control panel is not an object and does not have any way to restrict access to it, so we can eliminate it.\n4. Similarly, the other options, D: doorknobs and E: doorways, are actually objects and not places where we would interact with an object.\n5. This is because we would usually interact with a doorway by opening or closing it, not grabbing objects that are \"contained by\" doorways.\n6. Therefore out of the remaining choices, C: openings doors is the most appropriate.\n7. We can choose a common object that we typically interact with in this location.

Since the item costs $1000, we just multiply 0.75 by 1000 to get the reduced price.\n2. The discounted amount comes out to be $750, which means that we had applied a discount of 75% i.e. 0.75.\n3. 0.7 = 3/4 = 0.75\n\nAnswer: 0.75 x 1000 = 750", "answer": " 120"}

In terms of what is contained within the doorway, it is the door itself.\n7. Therefore, we need to select the option that describes the container of the door.\n8. The options remaining are D: doorknobs, E: doorway and D: door.\n9. The doorknob is the part of the door that is used to open it. It is connected to the door but does not contain the door itself.\n10. The doorway does not open the door from inside the house.\n11.

The question is concerned about friendship which means good relationship.\n2. The options can be classified into two categories: mammals and non-mammals.\n3. Mammals are expected to form a good relationship with humans which makes the two most likely candidates lion and cat.\n4. However, the non-mammal option that looks like it might be a good choice initially, isn't as likely.\n5. This is because they are known for being independent and not reliant on other animals for survival.\n6. Cats have been known to be friends with humans as they can be trained to play with people, while dogs and elephants have not been found to have that ability.\n7. Therefore, the best choices here between mammals are cat and lion.\n\nAnswer: lion\nInput: What is the correct definition of the word \"informed\"?

Option E: doorway would be the best choice since doorways can contain objects as long as they are small enough to fit.\nAnswer: E Doorway\n\nInput: Who usually makes up a line and what? Choices: A: a group of people B: a list C: a list of objects D: list of people E: a list of foods\nRationales: The question is about who typically makes up a line, and what is a typical line-making object.\n1. The question does not ask about what we would typically be in a line.\n2. Options A: a group of and B: a list of people make the most logical choice to be the answer to this question when we do not consider 'people' as the answer.\nThis is because a group of people and a list of people usually make up a line.\n3. Now, for the second step we need to know what would usually be in a line. This includes:\nA: a list of objects such as pens. B: a people line including people. C: a list of food.\n4. Hence, the answer is B' a line of people'. Now, we need to remove the options whose names are wrongly used in the question.\n5.

Option B: control panel can actually be inside a doorway, so we wouldn't know how to use it to 'grab an object', since we don't know what it is or if it's inside or outside a doorway.\n4. Option C: opening doors requires us to move beyond one door in order to grab an object.\n5. Option D: doorknobs are not grabbable, nor are they contained, so we can eliminate option D: doorknobe.\n6. Next, we analyze option E: doorway. 7. A doorway is both a shape and a location, which means it is in the shape of an entryway, whether it's open or closed. \n8. Therefore, 'grabbing an object from a doorway' actually means 'grabbing the object within a doorway'. This places the object inside the doorway, rather than outright in front of it.\n9.

Choices:  S: 12 ft B: 7 mi D: 9 in C: 6 ft F: 60 ft\nRationales: First, we should eliminate S, which is 12 feet and therefore much shorter than a pneumatic tune.\n1. 7 mi: 7 miles are not shorter than 12 ft.\n2. 6 ft: 6 ft is the same as 60 in. The conversion factor of 12 in is 1 ft. So 60 in is 5 ft. Therefore, 5 ft is shorter than 6 ft, so option D, 9 in is the only answer that fits.\n3. F, 60 ft is too long to be shorter than 6 ft and 5 ft.\n4. 6 in is 0.5 ft, so that must be less than 6.\n5. However, the only option that fits this description is F, 60 in is longer than 6. (1 ft = 12 in; 5 ft = 60 in) Choice F, 60 feet must therefore be the correct answer.\nAnswer: F", "answer": " 106000"}

A doorknob is merely a hardware used to open a door.\n5. Looking to option E: \"doorway\" the question is asking where to we grab an object that is within the doorway, not at the doorway.\n6.

Choices: A: time B: experience C: information D: memory E: opportunity\nRationales: One thing the woman could have lost, which could contribute to her sadness, could be TIME. She lost opportunity to do something. So the only option that fits here is 4th option A: time.\n\nRationales: Another thing she could have lost, which would contribute to the sadness, could be EXPERIENCE. She could be sad because she couldn't experience something. So the only choice that fits here is option 3 C: experience\n\nRationales - Yet another way for the woman to be sad is if she lost INFORMATION. So for this second sad state, the only choice that fits is 5th option D: information.\n\nRationaleses: When the woman was sad, she could have also lost something that contributed to the sadness - MEMORY. So now for the sad state, we can try option E. However, there is a chance that she could have had the memory of her life, and even then the memory could still be lost. So for this last sad state, the only option that fits is the 2nd option: B: experience\n\nRationale: If the woman was sad, which contributed to her sadness, then she could have also lost MEMORY.

Door Frame has the two essential elements of the requirement so we eliminate option D.\n4. Now, looking at the options left, it is obvious we cannot go with 'open door' since that is already covered by option E. \n5. We can also eliminate options B and E as they are all covered by option B.\n6: The final options left are A and C so the question is about which one would we grab first.\n7: The answer that makes intuitive sense is option C. In order to pick up an object, be it something heavy or light, whether open or contained, you first need to grab it. And option C refers to the door which is contained by the doorway. (Note: There may be specifics regarding the material and the design of the handle and knobs that should be used while picking up any object. But for now, the question only talks about a grab and not a certain way of a grab.)\n8: So that leaves option B which is incorrect.\n9: The answer is option C.\nAnswer:  C: door knob\n\nInput: Where could an employee find a place of learning? Choices:  B: library E: coffee shop C: workplace D: classroom A: office\nRationales:\n\n1. As there are no other options to compare the candidates with, we start with option A. It's clear that option A cannot mean 'workplace', because a workplace is always an employee's area of work. It may often be learning; the same way it may be eating (from the lunch box), or playing. But a workplace as an institution would never be a place of learning, as learning is only a part of your work and not the whole of it.\n2. Similarly, for the other options, we can eliminate one by one while comparing each one with the option already eliminated.\n3. For options, 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'E', we can eliminate them at once by determining what exactly an 'employee' is looking for. An employee or a worker never goes to a coffee shop so as to learn, in which case he can only go to a library for that. For classroom, he needs", "answer": " 24"}

It may be on the inside of the doorway, but is not something a person outdoors would have access to.\n6. Looking at option E, however, a person would indeed have access to a doorway and therefore grab any object contained by the doorway from that location.\n7. So, if you're outside a doorway and you need to grab an object on the other side of that doorway, you would grab it from the doorway itself.\n8. The other options are irrelevant distractions.\n9.

Looking at the remaining options, the best choice depends on our understanding of the phrase \"contained by a doorway\". \n4. \"Control panel\" is commonly found on doorways, but it is typically placed inside the doorway. \n5. Likewise, an \"opening door\" is often placed just next to the doorway, and option \"doorknob\" refers to the lever or grip that is used to pull the door open, often located on the side of the doorway. 6. \"Grab\" implies using our hands, so we can eliminate options C: opening doors and D: doorknobs. \n7. So, we are left with two options: \"control panel\" and \"grab\". \n8. Although a control panel could be said to be \"contained by a doorknob\", it will be more challenging to grab it effectively if it is far from the doorway. 9. Therefore, the answer to this question is B: control panel.\nAnswer: B : control panel\n\nInput: Who could you ask about if you wanted to know how to find a book at a library? Choices: 1.

To begin with, we note that the question includes options A, D, E and F. An options like A, D and E aren't related to the word 'conjurer'. An option like F might be related.\n6. Likewise, option B isn't related either. Hence, we are left with only two options, F and, C. However, option F sounds more likely to be about magic and conjuring things rather than 'keeping secrets'. This points our towards C.\n7. Option F is probably close to what they wanted, but there might have been a typo in the original post.\n8.

Option B is \"rook is bigger than knight\", but there is no size indicator on the given choices, making this an invalid comparison as well.\nOption C is \"rook is a solid vertical or horizontal column of alternating black or white squares\", which doesn't match what the question asks for. Option D states \"rook is a black square in a chessboard with a bishop and knights\", however, it isn't a black square in the chessboard, it is", "answer": " 8"}
{"text": "object that is on your TV and thus not contained by a doorway\n3. Continuing from there, it would be natural to first think of choosing the option that is closest to \"doorway\". This means option C: doorway would be a fair bet as doorway is part of the wordplay of this question.\n4. However, the next option is to eliminate based on knowledge. A control panel is not contained by a door, so B: control panel is ruled out. \n5. Similarly, option D: doorknobs and option E: doorknobs are also ruled because they don't contain anything.\n6. Hence, since doorway is the main relevant term in this question, it's best not to include option E: doorway.\n7. Hence, we end up only having option C: doorway so it would make the most sense to choose it as the final answer.\nAnswer: C: doorway\n\nInput: Is it likely the man got up, to check his house for the dog, before going to the bank? Choices:  yes A: yes B: no C: yes D: no E: no\nRationales:1. It's clear from the question that a man did not \"check his house for the dog before going to the bank.\" The phrase \"before going to the bank\" is present in the question itself. Hence, \"yes\" is the only possible answer.\n2. The other options, \"no\" and \"no\" are incorrect because they give the man as an action that wasn\u2019t performed.\n3.

So, options are effectively A: doorway and E: doorway.  5. Doorway and doorway sound like the same thing, and the question does not ask what kind of doorway but what kind of object is contained within it. Therefore, the correct answer is E: doorway, where we could grab a wide variety of objects if we chose to. \nAnswer: E: doorway\n\nInput: When was the last time that you heard someone say the words \"I feel\" at the same time? Choices:  B: whenever C: once D: never E: constantly\nRationales:1. The question is about when the last time someone said \"I feel\" at one time.\n2. The option that best meets this requirement is 'E: constantly', as we're talking about the use of a specific phrase by a speaker, rather than broad language usage.\n3. Since the phrase is used frequently in informal conversation, or even just daily speech, we're likely to hear it more than once. \n4. 'D: Never' is not applicable, as we would generally feel a certain way, and we would talk about those feelings and thus use the phrase. 'C: Once' is not as well-formed as 'E: Constantly', since it's a specific instance of this event, rather than 'Constantly' being the most recent instance of it.\n5. This leaves us with 'A: While' and 'B: Whenever' as the last two options.\n\nRationales:\n\n1. 'While' is incorrect as it is not a time term and is, in fact, the wrong time term to be using. In this case, the phrase \"I feel\" is an adverb and it is usually used to describe the verb of a sentence. So, we would not use it in a while, but rather while.\n2. We are seeking for the last time someone uttered the phrase \"I feel\", so we can eliminate 'B: Whenever'. \n3. Therefore, we have 'A: While' as", "answer": " 17"}

Choice A: Walking refers to an action a person generally does but not exclusively.\n2. Choice B: Flying generally refers to what animals do and not what humans do.\n3. Choice C: Smoking is a habit but not an active activity that humans are known for.\n4. Choice D: Sleeping also refers to a habit but not an explicit activity.\n5. Choice E: Driving is an active action but what humans are doing is not entirely related to what they are doing.\n6.

Typically, doors are used to encompass any opening that leads to a space, so an object contained by a room is contained by the room.\n4. We won't grab objects by the whole room, so we need an object located inside the room, for which the appropriate verb in this context is 'contained by' and not 'is contained by'.\n5. Now, we can eliminate option D: doorknobs, as these are on the inside of the door, not the outside. \n6. Further, option B: control panels is a door accessory that is not usually found in an entryway.\n7. Moreover, option C: opening doors can be used for opening the door or for other actions related to doors, but it can't be used to indicate that an object is contained by a door given its context.\n8.

{"text": "object, not a physical structure. Option C: control panel is also incorrect as it is not contained by a doorway and is not an object of any type.\n3. Moving on, let's consider options B: doorway, D: doorknobs and E: doorway.\n4. Doorknobs are not contained by a doorframe. Instead, they go along the doorframe, but are not inside it or contained by it.\n5. Doorframe means that the door is open, so no object can be grabbed from within it. Therefore, we can eliminate option D: doorknub.\n6. This leaves us with just two options: B: doorway and E: doorway, which are both correct.\n7. However, it's stated in the question that the object that is contained by the doorway can be manually grabbed. Thus, the answer should be C: opening doors.\n8. This is because opening a door can allow for manual access, and the act of opening a doorway would have caused the contained object to be in a position where it could be grabbed, as opposed to the contained state in response B: doorway and the passive state in response C: opening doors. \n9. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Opening doors.\nAnswer: B : opening doors\n\nInput: What are the results of the woman having to buy three boxes of kitty litter? Choices: 1.

The woman buying three boxes of cat lighter impact her lifestyle, as cat litter is required to keep a cat healthy and happy.\n2. If the woman is unable to afford three boxes of cat lifestyle, she may not be able to keep a cat in her household, which would likely have a negative impact on the cat's life.\n3. The woman may also experience a negative financial impact if she is unable to afford the three boxes and is forced to find other ways to care for her cat.\n4.

The last option left, then, is E: doorways.\nAnswer: E. doorway.\n\n### Rationale: The answer to the given question is doorway. This means that we choose the option that describes what is contained by the door. The question then provides us with the term 'contained', which we infer tells us that door is one of the terms. We look for the word that describes what is contained, and the only option that does that is 'doorway'. Thus, we choose doorway as the answer for the last question.\n\nInput: If one were going to an event, what are you most likely to see? Choices: A: red B: black C: blue D: pink E: orange\nRationales:\n1. The question is \"If one were going to an [event], what [color] are you most likely to [see]?\"\n2. This implies that a color is being described, as opposed to an object or person.\n3. Additionally, it implies that the [color] in question is likely specific to an event or gathering rather than being a general, more abstract [color].\n4. Looking at option A: red, option B: black, option C: blue, and option D: pink, we can see that these colors do not match the provided criteria, as they do not fit the description of being specific to an event or showing a preference towards a particular event.\n5. They are simply generic descriptions, without any specific attachment to a particular gathering or meeting.\n6. The only other option left, therefore, is E: orange.\nAnswer: E Orange.\n\nInput: What is the fastest method of cleaning the kitchen?

So, option B: control panel is eliminated. \n4. \"Opening doors\" can be a component of a doorway, so, option C: opening doors can be eliminated. \n5. Now, we need to pick one remaining choice from the remaining three options.\n6. Looking at the options, the only ones that can be located within a doorway are, option D: doorknobs and option E: doorways. \n7. \"Doorknobs\" are one component found within a door, hence they form part of a doorway. \n8.

Choices: A: take a nap C: work on weekends B: take a break D: take a shower E: work long hours\nRationales: First, let us explain the term'sleep-in'. By definition, a'sleep-in' refers to a person who sleeps in instead of waking up and rising early in the morning as is typical in other schedules.\n1. Therefore, the question asks about the job schedule that allows for sleep-ins. 2. Therefore, the answer can be inferred as 'allowing for sleep-ins'. 3. The answer to this is B: take a break. To allow someone to take a break is the same as allowing someone for sleep-ins/sleep-in schedules. 4. This eliminates options A, C, and D as those are not able to allow for sleep-ins/naps. 5. Option E: work long hours doesn't require that the sleep-in person be allowed for a nap/sleep-in schedule but rather that the job person/employee works long hours, which is irrelevant to the query.\nAnswer: B- Take a break\n\nInput: Choices:  A; A B; B C; C D; D E; E This answer choice makes sense when the first one doesn\u2019t.\n\nInput: The word 'deterred' means what one.

While it could be argued that option B: car is a place where we'd keep our key, we are more likely to leave one or more keys in the car, not all of them.\n2. Therefore, this would not be an appropriate place to keep the keys.\n3. The question gives us further information that we aren't looking for a place where we can only keep one key.\n4. This information eliminates option C: pockets.\n5. While drawers can often be used to store different types of keys, we can eliminate D: drawers.\n6. Since the question asks a general question not related to one specific kind of key, this removes option E: bedside table.\n7. There is likely to be an object in the room which we are more confidently able to keep the keys. That option could be B: car, but there are other possible locations.\n8.

Therefore the answer that fits the question is C: open doors.\nAnswer: C: opening doors\n\nInput: The teacher decided to cancel class because of what? Choices: F: a snow storm G: too much homework H: a thunderstorm I: a hurricane \nRationales: First, the question asks in which case would the teacher cancel class due to homework? \n1. The options given are: F: a snow-storm, G: too much home-work, H: a thunder-storm, and I: a hurricanes. \n2. The question is asking about a teacher who wants to cancel class due to \"homework\" but we are told that there are a few other options: snow storm, homework and hurricane. \n3. All the given options are situations that the teacher may feel the need to cancel class. \n4. The options of Hurricane and a thunderstorm would have a large affect on a class, and the teacher may have to cancel class in one of these two. However, if the teacher wanted to cancel due to \"homework\", then they would not have canceled due to hurricane and thunderstorm. \n5. Therefore, our final answer would be H: a thunder storm.\n6. Thus, the answer would be H: thunderstorm \nAnswer: H: thunderstorn\n\nInput: The dog that was adopted from the shelter seemed very happy, where would it have been before?", "answer": " 6"}

Next, we can eliminate C: opening doors, as it is not an object in itself and is not necessarily contained by a doorway, except in the case of a double doorway.\n4. With these eliminations, we have four options left to choose from.\n5. The choice D: doorknobs refers to individual door knobs, and the choice E: doorway refers to the structure itself.\n6. None of these options are contained nor would allow us to grab an object contained by the doorway.\n7. This leaves us with only the option B: control panel that is still applicable.\n8. This control panel is attached to a doorway, and can be used to control the doorway or close/open it. \n9. In this sense, this option is the most valid since it allows us to grab an object 'contained by a doorway'.\n10. So, option B: control panel is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B.\n\nInput: If you see some animals in the park that appear to be chasing each other, what might be able to explain it? Choices:  C: park rules C: other animal D: park worker E: park signs\nRationales:\n1. The question is about what we can assume about a pair of animal in the Park, based on the information that they appear to be chasing one another.\n2. This chasing between two animals could simply be an incidental interaction. However, if there were other animals and/or a park worker present and that other animal doesn't help the dog or isn't helping the dog catch the cat, it would not explain the situation.\n3. This is because in cases where there are other animals and a park worker present, chasing could be considered dangerous or unsafe behavior and the park worker would intervene. \n4. There would be no reason for the park worker not to intervene if not for the potential for harm.\n5. With these rules, we can eliminate options D, E as they do not include an additional element that could explain the animals.\n6. If there is another animal present that could explain or help interpret the situation, it is not possible to know until the question says that the other animal is present.\n7. Option B indicates that there is another animal present. \n8.", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": "object that isn't normally found in doorways.\n3. Option B, control panel, also seems like an out of place choice, because door control panels are typically separate and located elsewhere in a building.\n4. Similarly, options D and E, doorknob and doorway, also don't seem relevant, because the question asks about grabbing, not holding in place or opening, which is more relevant to a doorknob and a doorway.\n5. Thus the choices remaining are option C, which is an opening door, and option B, which is a control panel.\n6. To make it even simpler, when we go back to the sentence structure, let's look at it as a list rather than a list of parts. So, we see \"opening doors,\" \"control panels,\" and a blank space.\n7. Then, we read further down as, \"where is the correct place to grab it?\" And we see a choice, \"control panels.\"\n8. This indicates that we are looking for the correct place to pull something contained by a doorway out, and option B: control panel is the most direct answer to that.\n9. Thus the answer is B: control panel.\nAnswer: B. control panel\n\nInput: Dracula had a home in a _____. Choices: A: dark cave B: sunny meadow C: large ship D: tall castle E: brightly lit cave\nRationales: (1) This question refers to the home of Dracula as being in a cave (cave is capitalized in the answer).\n(2) Only the word \"cave\" fits in the structure of the sentence and only the word \"cave's\" plural form is used.\n(3) Since we don't want to change the \"cave\" portion of the sentence, we need to make sure that the \"Brightly Lit Caves\" (if they exist) are not located in meadows, large ships, tall castles, or somewhere else that might be sunny.\n(4) Since the only cave-like creature that might reside in such an environment is an owl, the correct option is E: Brightly-Lit.\nAnswer: E. Brightly-Lit", "answer": " 1979"}
{"text": "object that is found inside a house, not the doorway.\n3. Likewise, we can eliminate option D: doorknobs as well; doorknob refers to the metal part of a door that we open to gain entry or exit.\n4. The key phrase in the question is \"contained by\" a doorway. The objects contained by a doorway are not in the actual doorway\u2014the objects themselves are separate physical entities. \n5. To clarify, doorways typically consist of three parts: two walls, a frame to hold them together, and a door that closes them.\n6. An object contained by a door can be grabbed in the doorway itself, but not inside the closed door itself.\n7. So, among the remaining options, the only choice that makes sense in this interpretation is E: doorway. Hence, the correct answer.\nAnswer: B : doorway\n\nInput: Are you willing to eat anything that someone would like you to eat? Choices:  Yes B: If I like it C: No D: It could be something good\nRationales: This is a question that might seem a bit difficult to parse at first because we need to look at multiple components of the question in order to determine the correct answer.\n1. We can eliminate the options B: If I like It because this has nothing to do with what someone else is trying to get you to eat. This is simply a statement of preference. So, it is irrelevant to the question we're trying to answer.\n2. From the remaining options, there are two key components that we'll need to consider. These are:\n    * the phrase \"willing to eat\"\n    * and the phrase \"willing\" in general.\n    * A person is willing or unwilling to do or accept something. So, to know if someone is willing to eat something, we need to see if they are willing to do a thing they otherwise would not be willing to do.\n3. A person is not willing to eat something in general, without considering what someone else wants them to eat. So, among all the given options, only the option that involves acceptance is the one that makes the most sense.\n4. In any case, the correct option is D: It could be Something Good.\nAnswer: D : It could be Something good\n\nInput: Will this man be able to walk outside", "answer": " 123"}

{"text": "item inside a room, not within a doorway.\n3. We can also eliminate B: control panel, as a control panel refers to a set of buttons that control the mechanisms inside a door, but not an item itself.\n4. It's unlikely that you would grab an item with your hands through a doorway, which eliminates C: doorways.\n5. So, we're left with only choice E: a doorknob.\n6. A doorknob is an item inside a doorway, so it is the correct answer.\nAnswer: D D: doorknobs, since it refers to a doorknob\n\nInput: Where must a person go to read what they hear? Choices:  J: to a library B: no need D: to read it out loud E: with their eyes F: to a television\nRationales:\n1. The question states that we read the sounds we hear.\n2. Therefore, it makes sense to go to a library since the majority of libraries contain books, where you can read the sounds you hear.\n3. The phrase \"no need\" might allude to a scenario where you have no need to hear what you read.\n4. Since you can hear what you read in a library, with your eyes, this cannot be the correct answer.\n5. The phrase \"to read it out loud\" might allude to the idea of reciting or memorizing a written piece aloud, rather than reading it for comprehension.\n6. Since reading out loud and reading with your eyes refer to the same activity, this cannot be the answer.\n7. The phrase \"to a television\" implies that you read something you hear on a television.\n8. This is not necessarily the case, since some television shows are accompanied by text-based subtitling that is displayed on-screen in real time, regardless of audio or sound effects.\n9. Furthermore, television typically refers to audio and video content that is meant to be passively consumed rather than actively engaged with, such as a movie or show.\n10. Therefore, this cannot be the right answer.\n11. Based on the information provided in the question, the answer that best matches the logic and context is J: to a library, where you can read what you hear.\nAnswer: J: to a library\n\nInput: The speaker said 'This is", "answer": " 113"}

Choices:  D: gun shooting range B: police squadron E: game farm C: game reserve D: gun shooting range\nRationales: First, let us consider why we might need a handgun that does not need batteries. \n\n1. Handguns that use batteries typically need to be recharged or replaced regularly, which can be a hassle for users.\n2. So, a handgun that does NOT need batteries would be convenient for those who need to recharge batteries, such as those who may need them to function the device more often.\n3. Therefore the best answer is C) game reserve.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s consider the available choices:\n4.

{"text": "object and not contained by a doorway, even if it is possible to pick up the television and walk through a doorway.\n3.

Then, we need to determine the part of the doorway that the object is contained in.\n5. Among the choice B, C and D we have:\n6. C: an opening refers to a passageway, while B, D refer to an object that we would operate.\n7. Since neither of the options C: opening doors or D: door refers to a specific part of the doorway (i.e. door-knob or doorframe), they cannot be a reference to the contained object.\n8. This reduces our options further to: either B: control panel or E: doorway.\n9.

At the same time, it is important to break down the choices in order to narrow them down to the one that answers the question. In this case, the question is asking where a teacher and student could eat breakfast. Looking at the choices: school, mall, restaurant, farm, drive-thru. We need to consider if any of these could be where a teacher and student are having their breakfast.\n\nSolution: We should eliminate any options that would not be suitable places for a teacher and student to eat. This eliminates choice D: restaurant since it is a place where eating is the primary activity and not a breakfast destination. Also, choice E: farm is not a place where eating breakfast is possible, so we can eliminate this choice.", "answer": " 3"}

Looking at the remaining options, A: television and B: control panel, it's clear that the object is contained by the door from the outside, as it is not accessible from inside a room.\n8. Thus, the one that covers outside access is A: television.\n9. So, the answer is A. The word \"doorknob\" is an anachronism, and we can substitute it with \"door handle\"\nAnswer: A: television\n\nInput: Which location do you need to get in a place where you need to stop the car? (e.g. an ATM machine) Choices:  A. Highway B. Parking lot C. Gas station D. Store parking lot E. Rest stop (F. Stop sign)\nRationales: The question needs to be read as \"which location do you need to stop/park your car in a place where you are able to/forced to stop the car\" and not \"which location should you need to stop/ park your car at a place where you are unable to/forced to be stop the car\". Because of the choice of the word \"need\" and the implied location where is possible to stop, the locations B, D and E must be excluded. The location C and the location D can be excluded because the location C must be included when the question was \"Stop/park a car\", and the location D must be included when the choice of the question is A. The location C and location E can be excluded because they must be included when the location A is chosen. The locations that can be considered are A and F\n\nAnswer: F: Stop sign - A car can stop at a stop sign\nInput: Where would someone put money away that is earned in the store, it'", "answer": " 4"}

Similarly, we can eliminate option E: doorway, as the doorway itself is not an object. Instead, this is where we are contained while moving in or out of a door.\n4. So, we can eliminate options D & E.\n5. We need to find where we would grab an actual object that is contained by the doorway. \n6. This suggests that we would grab an object from where the doorway opens, which would be in option C.\n7. So, our answer would be C: Control panel/opening doors.\nAnswer: C: control panel/opening doors\n\nInput: If it's a bird, what are they not called? Choices: 1. A: Penguin 2. B: Dog 3. C: Duck 4. D: Swan 5. E: Cat\nRationales: The key to this is how to eliminate options that are different from the name you are looking for.\n1. The name of the bird you are looking for is a bird. So we can eliminate options 5 & 6, which are not birds.\n2. Option 1, Penguin, is not a name for a bird which implies that option not correct.\n3. The name of the animal you are looking for is not given, but instead it is not one of the given answers.\n4. Therefore we can eliminate option 4, Swan, and 3 Duck, as these animals have other names.\n5. Therefore the answer would be E: Cat, as it is not Cat.\nAnswer: E- Cat\n\nInput: How could you find out the answer to a question that you don't remember?

The remaining choice, option D: doorknobs, could potentially be contained by a doorway, but it's an indefinite object that could be a handle or another similar item. This isn't concrete about what specifically is contained by the doorway. Hence, we are left with option E: doorway, among the given options.\n6. The doorway contains any object that is inside the doorway.\n7. So, option E is the most logical answer. Since the answer choice refers to the entire doorway, the correct answer is E: doorway.\nAnswer: E.

A navigation app on your smartphone. D. A pizza delivery driver.\nRationales: The correct answer is choice D. You would get lost if you are looking for the store in the distance, and would want a navigation app on your smart device to assist you. Choices Choice A and B are already mentioned in the question itself. If you have a GPS device then you wouldn't be asking this question in the first place. Choice C is a redundant question because choice D would use a navigation app on your phone or laptop thus using choice C. Choice D is a pizza delivery driver and the options themselves are nonsensical.\nAnswer: D = A Pizza Delivery Driver\n\nInput: What are some similarities between water fountains and drinking wells?

Option C: opening doors is not directly related to the action of grabbing an object; we would open the door and then retrieve the object. However, the fact that the object is contained by the doorway indicates that the doorway is important to this action.\n5. We then eliminate option D: doorknobs, as they are not within the doorway.\n6. This leaves option E: doorway.\n7. Doorway is essentially another word for door. So, this refers to the doorway itself, which is where the object would be positioned if it is contained by the door.\n8. Therefore the answer to the question should be E: doorway. We could also answer a question in this way.\nAnswer: E : doorway or E : door\n\nInput: What does a dog do to have the ability to move? Choices: 0 A: walk B: jog C: skip D: run E: dance\nRationales: First, the question asks what a dog would need to have the capacity to move, or take action.\nNext, to be able to take action or move, a dog would likely need some sort of body that allows it to take a certain form or shape.\nSo, at the most basic level, the body part or shape a dog should have in order to move is the dog's legs or limbs.\nWithout legs, a dog would not be able to move.\n\n1. Looking at the given options, however, we can eliminate several choices immediately, since they do not have any relation to what legs or limbs would be.\n2. Option A: walk is an activity that a dog would be able to perform because it has legs.\n3. Hence, we eliminate it from consideration.\n4. Looking next at option B: jog. This is essentially an amalgamation of the words 'walk' and 'run', with the definition of 'jog' that it involves a more sustained pace of leg movement or locomotion, like one would do whilst 'walking' but with more vigor. \n5. This is still very much a movement related to and associated with the dog's legs. Thus B: jog is also not the answer to the question.\n6. Next we are left", "answer": " 54"}

Both B: control panel and E: doorway are items contained within some sort of door or doorway. However, option E: doorway is not an object.\n6.

Among the options B, C, and D - the first 2 seem to not contain any objects, whereas option D could do so. \n5. However, B is a control panel while C is an opening door, and their placements are irrelevant. \n6. As for D - we're not specifically talking about the door itself, we're referencing the door handle or other related hardware. Therefore, it would still be possible to grab an object from the door without physically handling the door itself.\n7. So, of the remaining choices, D seems to be the most suitable for the question and the answer is A: \"control panel\".\nAnswer: A: control panel\n\nInput: In which of the four directions, would you find a door in a building? Choices:  F: east G: south H: west I: north\nRationales:\n\n1. Looking at the options, the word \"door\" is mentioned only in options: F, G, I.\n2. Hence, the options that do not have \"door\" in the name do not have a door as one of its possibilities.\n3. Hence, we can consider only the options: F, G and I.\n4. However, we understand in some cases, F and G refer to directions, whereas I may be a generalization of one of the directions mentioned above.\n5. We can eliminate F, G, since directions and buildings have no relation to directions and as there is an interruption in the phrase due to options G and I, we can infer that doors can only be found in directions.\n6. Considering this, we can eliminate the options: F, I.\n7. We can eliminate option I - as I is one of the options among directions, and we are looking for a door in a building, so that door cannot be found in the direction south.\n8. We can understand that option H stands for west as it comes directly after option F, but doors can't be found in the west direction. So, only option H is eliminated.\n9. Now, we are left with two options: F, and G, and from the available options, we get a conclusion that doors can be found in all the", "answer": " 25"}
{"text": "object contained by a television, rather than a doorway.\n3. Similarly, we can eliminate option D: doorknobs, as it specifies a doorway. \n4. Looking at option E: doors, we can deduce that the 'open doors' portion of it refers to 'opening doors', suggesting that we are talking about the doorway itself, not the actual door.\n5. Given this, we can eliminate option E and D and narrow down the choices to A, which is a TV, B and C, which are control panels.\n6. In order to do so, we need to compare the definitions given for options A, B and C in the dictionary.\n7. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, Control Panels refers to either a group of controls that operate some appliance or a device that includes all the controls of a machine.\n8. On the other hand, the Oxford dictionary describes a Doorway as consisting of the door and the walls on each side of the door supported by pillars, lintels, etc.\n9. So, we can deduce the meaning of 'doorway' as being those pillars/lintels, not the entire width of the wall encompassing the door.\n10. The same dictionary gives the definition of TV as A Television set or television set, especially an analogue set, used to show programmes and to receive broadcasts of programmes, sports and other events from a transmitter.\n11. So, we can see that the TV, which is a type of set, falls under the category of a set, and not the doorway.\n12. This eliminates option A.\n13. Option B, however, is ambiguous as it refers to various things including a cabinet, a doorway, and even a door itself.\n14. So, it cannot be answered by choosing either B or C.\n15. However, the door itself could be grabbed from the doorway, as it is contained within the doorway. So, the answer is C: Door.\nAnswer: C: Door", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "item that is not typically contained within a doorway.\n3. While we could grab an item from a window, that isn't what the question is asking.\n4. Option D: doorknobs is a good candidate since we normally grab door knobs and use them to open doors. However, while the item might be contained by the doorway in the sense of being located next to the doorway, door knobs are not contained within, as the handle is located outside of the door frame.\n5. Option E: doorways is also a good candidate, but a doorway is not normally an item and it is too unclear and broad of an option to be the best choice.\n6. Therefore left with options: C: control panel and B: opening doors, we can eliminate C: control panel, as we aren't typically opening a control panel but rather operating it.\n7. Leaving us with option B: open doors.\n8. Now, a door could open to reveal an object inside of it.\n9. So, option B: open door could represent an object contained by a particular doorway.\n10. In this case the door will be a doorway, specifically an entry door.\n11. So, the correct answer is B: opening doors.\nAnswer: B : opening doors\n\nInput: How would an animal react to being called a dog?

Here you can see an example of how questions can become a little trickier. This question is essentially asking \"How would an animal react to someone calling (him or her) a dog\"? If we assume the animal can understand what's being called, it is a more complicated question because we are not just trying to choose a physical reaction, but also an emotional reaction. The options we need to consider are:\n\n    1. A: \"Get nervous\u201d, \n      1(a): An animal may get nervous, scared, or give you a warning.\n      2(b):  An animal is probably not going to give you a warning, because you called them", "answer": " 21"}

{"text": "electronic device not located in a doorway.\n3. Option B: control panel suggests a mechanical device in or around a doorway, but as door panels are typically not accessible from the outside, it can be eliminated. \n4. Option C: opening doors is not relevant in this context because it would refer to operating the door and not the object that is inside the door. \n5. Option D: doorknobs are primarily used to open doors, so it would not be appropriate in a question that involves a contained object rather than a physical opening.\n6. So, option E: doorway would be the most appropriate answer. A doorway in this context refers to an opening in a doorway, not just the doorway itself. \n7. Since the chosen path does not directly result in the movement and containment of a certain object, it must include some way to contain or store the object and move it forward. \n8. This is achieved simply by the path through or around a doorway as mentioned in the option. \n9. So, the correct answer to the question where would you grab an object that is stored by a doorway is E: doorway.\nAnswer: E : doorway\n\nInput: What is the only thing that a hiker needs to take?

This rule of thumb is particularly helpful if the hiking trip is expected to be over a long period of time.\n2. Looking at the given answers,  it's clear that the option \"map\" would not be the only thing a hiker needs to survive if the trip was long.\n3. Option \"trail Esquimo\" is just an adjective in the phrase and doesn't describe anything specific or only item that the hiker requires.\n4. Options B, C, and D would be in the list for what one can take on a hiking trip, but they are not exclusive of other items. B, C and D would all be acceptable items to add to a list of what a hiker may need.\n5. So, it would follow that a hiker need not take only B, C, or D, depending on the circumstances.

For the remaining choices, we need to find an object that is specifically contained by the doorway and is accessible using a doorknob:\n6. Since a doorknob is a commonly used item when opening a door, the simplest and most appropriate answer amongst the remaining options is E: doorway. \n7.

Choices: A. Bail B. Deal C. Lawyer D. Probation E. Witness\nRationales:1. When it comes to prison-related matters, the term \"being in jail\" has often taken the meaning of being incarcerated.\n2. The question \"How to get out of jail fast\" is therefore asking how to get out of prison or being incarcerated, or how to reduce the time spent there. \n3. It is common for people who have been imprisoned or have served time in prison, to be released under certain conditions or circumstances (such as a court order), which is referred to as a release or probation. \n4.

Option C: opening doors does not make sense, because we normally don't open doors to get something out of them.\n5. To summarize, we can now narrow down the available options to D: doorknobs, and E: doors.\n6. Among these, doorknobs are fixed, passive structures that mainly function as handles for doorways. This would mean that objects we grab from these are not contained by doorways but held freely.\n7. Hence, the answer should be option E, which means that the object is contained by a doorways.\n8. To elaborate, the object would be contained or trapped by the structure of the doorway itself, and we should grab it from the opening of the doorway. \n9.

Choices:   A: energy B: electrolytes C: caffeine D: nutrients E: calories\nRationales: First, I'll note that the question asks what the hiker needed \"to drink,\" not to eat or to drink to.\n7. This means that the answer will need to refer to something the hiker needs in a drink, not in food.\n8. Among these choices, caffeine, calories, and electrolytes do not need to be in drinks.\n9. This leaves us with  B: energy and D: nutrients.\n10. However, these do not make sense because in the given situation, the hiker would be going hiking. Nutrients tend to be consumed by the active, but sedentary people prefer energy. \n11. So, option A: energy can be eliminated. Now, option D: nutrients sounds reasonable.

Option D: doorknobs, is physically possible, but would require a level of strength, dexterity or reachability that exceeds the normal bounds of human ability.\n6.

Option E: doorways doesn't describe an actual object that a person would normally reach for near a doorway, but an opening that might not provide an object for a person to grab onto.\n6. So we are left with options C: opening doors and B: control panel.\n7.

Zoo is also not a place that the ocean is found. A zoo is a place where animals are held for exhibition, and not a place where oceans are present.\n4. Under the sea or under the sea describes the underwater part of an ocean. So, this is a misplaced option.\n5. Underwater does not describe the seas that are found on Earth. While the Earth has many ocean basins, each being a separate body of water with unique characteristics, it does not have oceans.\n6. Therefore our options that are not places where oceans are located are A: under the sea, B: under the ocean, and C: underwater.\n7. There can be many different seas located under one earth surface.

The doorknob option, option B, specifies that we are talking about an object contained in a doorway, and that we would grab that object.\n7. So, option B, doorknob, is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B. doorknob\n\n### Instructor Post-Solution:\nAnswer: A.

{"text": "unnecessary piece of information.\n3. The phrase \"contained by a doorway\" indicates an object that is placed against or within the doorway. You would typically grab an object such as a doorknob only if it's already inside the door.\n4. If the door is opening, then you would need to grab one of the opening doors instead. If the door is closing, you would need to grab a doorknob which is already inside the door. So, option E is out as well.\n5. We can eliminate option B: control panel because a control panel is typically found on electrical appliances located outside the doorway.\n6. Option C: opening doors is a group of options containing all the doors available. We cannot differentiate between the doors, so we can eliminate option C.\n7. This leaves us with options D & E - the doorknob and the doorway. The phrases \"object contained by a doorway\" and \"doorknob\" appear to refer to the same object. \n8. So, the fact that a doorknob is located inside a door would suggest that an object contained by a doorknob also contains the doorknob inside it.\n9. So, the correct answer is that the object is contained by a door, hence option E, the doorway is correct.\nAnswer: E. doorway\n\nInput: If there are 30 minutes to play and you play 5 minutes a day, for how many days will each day be longer than 5 minutes from start? Choices:  - B: 2 C: 4 D: 7 E: 15 F: 24 G: 12\nRationales: The question is asking how many days in the duration of 30 minutes each day will be longer than 5 mins. So if days are playing on the 1st day, days will then be playing on 30 minutes + 4 days. If play does not happen for 2 days due to play on some other day, then again, play will return on another day, and so on. Hence, it's clear that the total number of days would be 2 + 4 + 7 for a total of 15.\n\n\n\nInput: I did the work, the reward is what? Choices: A. food B. compliment C", "answer": " 19"}
{"text": "object and we want to know where we'd grab it from a doorway.\n3. We can also eliminate option E: doorway, because it's the object itself.\n4. Among the remaining options: B: control panel, C: opening doors, D: doorknop, and E: doorway, we need to find one which best supports our statement.\n5. Looking carefully at these four options, we can eliminate option D: door knob, because it represents a single part of the doorway that has a mechanical role in opening or closing the door.\n6. It doesn't hold any objects or have any value beyond its use for opening and closing.\n7. Similarly, we can eliminate option C: opening doors, because it also only describes a mechanical part of the doorway and does not contain any objects.\n8. Thus, we are left with the options B: control panel and E: doorway.\n9. Looking at the two remaining choices, a control panel is some form of display system for a device that is often used for communication. \n10. In such a scenario, you would want to interact with the control panel, not grab it and carry it with you.\n11. Therefore, the answer would be E: doorway. You would want to grab something from the doorway and it makes the most sense to do so if what you're grabbing is contained by the doorway itself, i.e. the doorway encloses the objects you're grabbin.\n12. Thus, the answer to this question is E: doorway. \nAnswer: E: doorway\n\nInput: In what is there food?

Option B: control panel of a computer can also be eliminated, as, once again, it's not often an object that gets contained by doorways. \n4. Option C: opening doors is a bit tricky. If the question refers to using a door as a container for an object, then option C could be correct.\n5. Yet, \"opening doors\" is a verb that can be used to refer to the process of moving a door and not necessarily opening a door to its fullest capacity to create some kind of container. \n6. Therefore, we can eliminate C as well.\n7. This leaves us with options D: doorknobs and E: doorways. \n8. If using the doorknob to grasp the object within the doorway, then this would not require opening the door as much as possible. \n9. Therefore, we can exclude option E as well. \n10. This leaves us with only option D: doorknib, as the object is grasped by the doorknob of the door, and not by a wider opening that could be made by opening the door further.\n11.

{"text": "object typically located within the house.\n3. If we're grabbing an object in a doorway, it means we're outside of the house. This also means that options B and C can also be eliminated. \n4. Option D refers to a doorknob, which is a part of the door, rather than a location or space within the doorway.\n5. This leaves us with option E: doorway. A doorway refers to a passageway that someone is entering and exiting through. \n6. There is nothing else a person could be grabbing in this passageway but there's enough space for them to reach over to one of the doors. \n7. This is what the word \"doorway\" refers to, that is, the open space. \n8. An object is \"contained\" in such a space, even if the person cannot fully see it or touch it immediately. \n9.

It is saying \"he is not getting water\" which means that the person in question is not getting access to water (it doesn't say whether or not he wants to get water, so the choice for thirsty should be ruled out). \nNext, we examine the different options provided: \n1. The first choice is saying that he isn't a fan. This doesn't necessarily mean he is not a fan of getting water. The choice may refer to the sport fishing. \n2. The second choice may refer to him going with the flow of the stream.\n3. The third choice is about him wanting to stay dry. \n4. The fourth choice refers to him doing his best.\nWe can discard options 1, 3 and 4 because they are not about the person not getting water. We can also discard option 2 because the option refers to him going with the stream - not to him not getting water. \nThere is only one", "answer": " 6"}

Option C: opening doors, an object which needs two doorknobs, is also not within a doorway and can't be picked up.\n6. Option D: doorknobs is definitely not the answer since it's a non-countable noun.\n7. Option E: doorknob, an object which needs a doorknob to be picked up, is definitely within a doorway, and option E is not the answer because it's not an object but a noun used to refer to an object.\n8. Option D: doors, an inanimate object which needs a dooknob and cannot be picked up, is the only option that can be picked up, and is therefore the correct answer.\nAnswer: D Choices: doors\n\nInput: In an alleyway, who would likely find a lost dog?

Option B: control panel, is similarly not the most appropriate answer, as the door and what's contained within it would not be considered by a burglar. \n4. Option D: doorknobs, is technically held by a doorknob but it's not contained by the door itself. \n5. The burglar is not typically concerned with simply taking the doorknob, but with having access to the object behind the door.\n6. Thus, we can eliminate options B: control panel and D: doorknobb. \n7. From the remaining choices we can deduce that the burglar is most interested in the object that remains contained by the door. It's in the doorway or underneath the door or within the doorway, but in any case, it's contained by the door. \n8. We thus can eliminate option C: opening doors, as it's not strictly contained by the door.\n9. Of the remaining options, choice E: doorway is a more appropriate answer, as when the door is closed, the object under or within the doorway would be completely invisible and thus not something that a burglar would be able to take.\n10.

Option C: Opening doors, seems unlikely, since this is a generic name for openings in a door and nothing here restricts the opening to a specific doorway.\n5. Option D: doorknobs, may contain objects, but this would be unlikely since a person would typically open the door first to access the object. 6. Then, we can move towards option E, doorway. Option E does fit with the idea of a doorway since it's a structure that includes an opening, similar in concept to what we are looking for.\n7. However, we don't know what kind of object it contains, so we'll leave it as an option. 8. Looking at the remaining options. Option C: Openings, may sound right at first but the description says that an opening is a structure containing an opening, so this doesn't fit the criteria we're looking for.\n9.

Options C: opening doors and E: doorway are redundant; a doorway can still function as the location in which we grab an object, so these can be disregarded\n4. Therefore, the three remaining choices can be analyzed as follows:\n5. 'Control panel: The term \"control panel\" is generally used to refer to a specific kind of electronic device or system. It often contains a series of buttons and switches designed to control other devices or systems.\n6. 'Doorknob: On standard door frames, the doorknob is a simple lever that is attached to a hinge on either side of the door. It can be used to open and close the door by turning the lever. Doorknobs are often made of metal or plastic and can be found attached to the inside or outside of a door. On double doors, there is usually a doorknob on each side of the door.\n7. 'Door: A doorway, also known as the doorframe or portal, is a opening in a wall, space or object that forms a access point from one side to another.\n8. All the given options are the literal definition and would be the choice that a person would make if the question was phrased as a simple statement, 'Where would you grab something contained by a doorway?'\n9. However, the question is posed as a \"where could you\" question or \"where might you\" question, meaning it's asking where you might get something from in a certain situation.\n10. Given this, we must interpret the options to have at least one characteristic or property that would help us achieve this goal, not merely simply \"contain\" something, which is what the literal definition would suggest. \n11. This helps us understand how we might \"get\" something from a doorway; we could do so with a control panel, a door, or a doorknob. \n12.

From the given options I: doorway, II: bathroom, III: living room, IV: kitchen, and V: bedroom, we can eliminate options that do not contain a bed such as II: Bathroom and IV: kitchen.\n2.

They're typically positioned on the sides of the door, not held within the doorway. \n9. Likewise, the handle of a door is often shaped like a doorknob but isn't referred to as a doorknob. It's called the handle because it is used as a means of handling the door. \n10. Hence, it is more likely that a doorknob would be used to open the door as opposed to being the door itself. So, we can eliminate this option.\n11. Now, we're left with A: television and C: opening doors. \n12. A: television and C open doors are typically used to indicate turning a key or turning a knob to open a door. \n13. We can eliminate option A: television as it is not an object that can be held. \n14. We can also eliminate C: opening doors, due to the same reasons earlier discussed, referring that we can access a door either by a key or a doorknob (as in a handle). \n15. Therefore, The answer should be something that can be held or is held to open a door and we end up with B: control panel, which is the only option left.\n16. So, the answer is A.\n\nAnswer: A: television\n\nInput: Which of these", "answer": " 240"}
{"text": "outdoor object and not an indoor one.\n3. Option B: control panel is incorrect, as we would never grab any article by the control panel, which typically refers to a machine's control board.\n4. Option D: doorknobs are also wrong as they are not directly attached to or contained by a doorway and aren't suitable for catching items.\n5. With one choice eliminated, we need to examine option C: opening doors. It is an indoor object and typically used to let people into a room, which is indoors. \n6. The choice of \"doorway\" can be eliminated as well as it means \"an exterior section of the exterior wall of a building that is fitted with a door\" which is not at the same area as a door, where an object would be stuck.\n7. With two choices eliminated, only two options remain to examine: B: Control panel and C: Opening Doors.\n8. Now, C: Opening Door is an incorrect choice since objects in the room cannot be caught from the doorway and it wouldn't be considered a suitable catching place.\n9. What's left, then, is B: Control Panel. In case of a door being open, we want to catch the object in a corner and a control panel is a perfect catch.\n10. That is the answer to the question.\nAnswer: B - Control Panel\n\nInput: Where may one find the end of a road? Choices: \nA: dead end\nB: finish\nC: street\nD: avenue\nE: alley\n\nRationales:\n\n1. Dead-end, street, avenue, and alley, are all parts of a road system.\n2. Therefore, the answer must be a part of a road system. Dead ends are not physical roadways, but rather points on the map.\n\nAnswer:\nC - Street.\n\nInput: To avoid a traffic jam, should you stop, move to the right side of the road, or pull out into the nearest street? Choices: \tA: Stop\n\tB: Move to the right side of road.\n\tC: Pull into nearest street.\n\nRationales\n\n1.\tThe question asks what action one should take to avoid a traffic jam to ensure that they do not get stuck", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "item that is generally not contained by doorways.\n3. We can also eliminate option E: doorway, as it is a thing that is contained by doorways. Therefore, it is a container for an object.\n4. This leaves us with options B, C, and D.\n5. As we know, option D: doorknobs, are the objects of choice that would be contained by a doorway and used to open the door, so the answer is B: control panel.\nAnswer: B. control panel\n\nInput: What may be left behind during the process of watering plants? Choices:  B: soil C: hose D: water E: watering can\nRationales:\n\n1. This is an inference test.\n\n2. We can determine what is lost during the process of water plants, for example when we water plants. This is a necessary thing that is lost during the process.\n3. So for the first option B: soil, we know that all the soil is not lost when watering plants. We can make this inferred by saying that the answer is not necessary in the first place.\n4. We can make the same reasoning for the second option C: hose.\n5. We are left with the third choice D: water and E: watering can.\n6. Option D: water is the answer because it is the thing that is lost when water is used to water a plant.\n\nAnswer: D: Water\n\nInput: The girl was given a big surprise, it made her do what?

What a surprise can be, the person is likely to do one of the following based on the surprise.\n3. Option B: dance - would probably be the reaction of some girls and some families.\n4. Option D: write note - would not be a usual reaction, as most people would just yell the surprise.\n5. So options A: laugh, B: dance, and D: write a note, are not the proper answers to the question. What would an expected reaction or an usual reaction from a girl is option C: yell. So the correct answer is Option C.\n\nAnswer: C: Yell", "answer": " 54"}
{"text": "object that is not contained by a doorway, unless we are talking about doorways in the context of televised baseball games. If that is the intended meaning of \"where would you grab an object that is being contained by a doorway,\" then option A is correct.\n3. Options B and C are both options for grabbing the given object contained within a doorway. Both would be options if the person is standing inside the doorway and attempting to grab whatever is contained behind the door.\n4. Since the options would be identical in this situation, we will instead examine them in a different context.\n5. We can consider option C in a scenario where we are holding onto the object and trying to pull it toward us; this would require us to hold onto it and we would need to use the doorknob and/or doorknob handle to grab an object that is behind a door. \n6. We can eliminate option D: door because it refers to the door itself. \n7. So, using option E: doorway, we can also examine if there are any other possibilities, which there might be. \n8. We can consider option B: control panel. \n9. A control panel typically includes a number of buttons and screens, many that are within reach if you are standing near the door. So, if the object contained by the doorway is a device with multiple control panels, like a computer or phone, then we would be correct in answering that option B: control panel would be where the object was contained. If not, we can eliminate option E: doorknob, as there are multiple reasons why we might grab either the doorknob or doorknob handle on a door opening. \n10. For these reasons, we can conclude that option B: control panels would be a correct answer.\nAnswer: B. Control panel\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThis question contains multiple context-free statements.\n\n- Option A does not satisfy the word requirement \"that is being contained by a...\" and additionally lacks the word \"doorway\" as part of the phrase. As such, it is inaccurate.\n- The word contained by a... in option B seems to reference that there is a person standing near a door. This is accurate.\n \n- Option C seems to reference a person who is standing within the doorway attempting to grab some unknown item", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": "item that cannot be contained by a doorway by itself.\n3. Looking at the other choices, option B: control panel contains the word 'panel'. A panel is a surface with doors or drawers, so option B: control panel refers to a panel with a door, which contradicts the need to hold an object that is contained within a doorway. So, we can eliminate option E: doorway.\n4. Next, option F: doorway itself can't contain an object, since the object has to first be held or contained by a doorframe.\n5. Hence, we will end up selecting option D: doorknobs.\n6. They can be used to open a door frame and thus, they can contain an object inside the doorway.\n7. So, D: doorknub is the correct answer.\nAnswer: D Doorphobia is the fear of doorway. However it is not the correct answer. Answer: D Doorknub", "answer": " 350"}
{"text": "object that doesn't fit with what the question asks.\n3. Options B and D are incorrect because they are not things that we would be concerned with when trying to grab an item that's contained by the doorway.\n4. So, that leaves us with options C and E: opening doors and doorway.\n5. Since the question asks where we would grab 'an object' contained by the doorway, we can discard option E immediately.\n6. The other option here is C: opening doors.\n7. An opening door would typically be where we would grab an item. So, it makes the most sense logically as the answer.\nAnswer: C: opening doors\n\nInput: What might you smell at an elementary school? Choices: \t A: a lot of children B: a lot of teachers C: just students D: a lot of food E: a lot of sweat\nRationales: Elementary school students include both children and teachers.\nTherefore, you would expect to smell not just children, but also teachers and the other staff at an elementary school.\nSo, this narrows down our options to A: a lot of students and D: a lot of teachers are the best answers.\nAnswer: C and D\n\nInput: How might you find a teacher at the school? Choices: A: ask students B: check schedules C: check email D: call the office E: check attendance\nRationales: A \"school\" in this context includes children and teachers.\nFurthermore, \"teachers\" attend the school, along with \"students\", and other \"staff\".\nAs a result, the best choices that fit this situation are A: ask students, and B: check schedules.\nAnswer: B and C\n\nInput: In some cases, what might someone be thinking? Choices:\t A: nothing B: a good idea C: thinking D: about nothing important E: very seriously\nRationales: The question asks for an example of instances where someone is \"thinking\".\nThe question doesn't provide a context for these instances.\nSince \"thinking\" refers to a mental activity, such as reasoning, problem solving, and other cognitive processes, the most likely places that someone would be doing this is a \"thinking\" setting, such as an examination or when someone is preparing to complete a task", "answer": " 59"}
{"text": "object we would see inside the doorway but can't be grabbed inside the doorway. \n3. We can also eliminate option E: doorway, since the question doesn't explicitly state that we are within the doorway, we can't assume that we're within the doorway to grab an object contained by the doorway. 4. We can also eliminate control panel and opening doors, since they are objects inside the doorway, not contained by the doorway which is outside it.\n5. So we're left with options C: doorknob and D: doorknub. \n6. We can rule out doorknob, since it is not an object contained by a building.\n7. So, we reach the rationale that we take doorknub as the choice of our option.\n8.

It asks which of the given 5 different things I used when I got to the super market. 2. We eliminate choice A: WALLET as it refers to a physical object that is not needed at a supermarket. 3. We eliminate choice B: COINS as it refers to the act of having coins that are needed for a change, so it has nothing to do with the physical object at all. 4. We eliminate choice C: A PIGGY BANK as it is never used in a supermarket but outside of it and also does not deal with the change required to buy any object in a supermarket. 5. In Choice D: AN ATM the word ATM refers to a machine which is used at the super market or at any bank, and the same happens with choice E: A BANK, so the answers are respectively D: AN ATM and E: A BANKB.\nAnswer: D - AN ATM & E - A BANK", "answer": " 91"}
{"text": "object that is unlikely to be contained by a doorway or to grab in any way\n3. We can now eliminate option B: control panel, since the person would preferably have the door open to grab the thing. This indicates that they would not be trying to open the door.\n4. The option C: doorway doesn't directly refer to an object but rather to the whole room. Hence this cannot be an answer.\n5. Moving onto option D: Door knob. It can technically contain objects, but the key notion here is that we are grabbing the object, so we would not be able to use this answer.\n6. Moving onto E: doorway, this is the only option that refers to an object that may be grabbed.\n7. However, from the text, we know that the door is already open and the object is contained by the doorway itself.\n8. The only thing contained by a door is itself, so in this case, choosing the door as an answer would be redundant.\n9. Therefore the answer is Choice E: doorway.\nAnswer: E : doorway\n\nInput: What might someone with a broken tooth feel? Choices:  E: in good health A: pain B: no pain C: numb\nRationales: First, we note that the question asks us what a broken tooth pain feels like.\n1. Next, we note that option A: Pain does not directly refer to feelings. Pain is an emotion or a sensation, rather than a feeling.\n2. Therefore, we can eliminate choice A: Pain. \n3. We also note that option B: No pain cannot be an answer since it's a contradiction. \n4. It seems that among the remaining choices, the most appropriate one is C: numb since we know that broken teeth lead to sensitiveness or sensitivity in the part where the crack occurred, often making the area feel numb.\n5. In addition, since a crack tooth doesn't hurt, and the crack itself can be experienced as a numbing feeling, the answer should be C: Numb.  \nAnswer: C: Numb\n\nInput: A person would see someone in a dream if they were asleep.

{"text": "electronic device and not confined within a doorway.\n3. Option B: control panel, likewise, is an electronic element, so it is also unlikely to be chosen in the given context.\n4. Similarly, option D: doorknobs are probably not accessible for grabbing an object, as they would probably be attached to the door.\n5. Therefore options B, C, and E can be eliminated. \n6. Option A: doorway does seem to fit the context.\n7. In this answer, the doorway is the door itself and it's containing an object.\n8. We can also consider option E, which states that the doorway is the opening door. \n9. This suggests that the 'doorway' can contain a number of objects which are being accessed through their respective doors.\n10. But as doorways go, they rarely contain objects on their own. The concept of the doorway can only be applied to objects which are attached to a door.\n11. Therefore, option E is also incorrect.\n12. In the remaining options, we also have A: doorway, which seems to be the correct answer. Since, the options given are B: control panel, C: opening doors, or E: doorway. \n13. These refer to elements of the doorway itself, the opening of which may contain an object.\n14. However, if the object is contained by being in the doorway, we would be more likely to access it by means of the doorway itself.\n15.

{"text": "object that is not contained by a doorway or is otherwise not relevant.\n3. We now move to the phrase 'contains the doorway', which refers to the doorway's interior space or cavity. \n4. This implies that the doorway is not just a physical structure, but also refers to a physical space.\n5. An opening contains an object, so we are looking for an object that is contained in an opening, not in a literal doorway.\n6. So, option B: Control panel is eliminated, as a control panel is not contained in an opening. \n7. So, we are left with one choice: D: door knob. \n8. A door knob is the most salient feature of a door. It both opens and closes the door, making its position and movement crucial to the functioning of the door. Thus, it is an object that functions as both opening and containment - two things that the question asks us to find.\n9.

Option D: \"doorknob\" is definitely a kind of doorway, but the question is asking about \"grabbing an object\", not simply about opening and closing a door.\n6. The only option left is E: doorway itself. We can look at a doorway as a kind of container, and its object is contained by it.

Since the question is asking where we would grab the object, location plays a key role. Choice D does not indicate any specific location of an object within a doorway, making it not a viable choice.\n6. Similarly, option E indicates the doorway as a location for the object, however, it seems as though the question is asking about something within that doorway, so the answer needs to more specific.\n7.

This question refers to a situation where a bicyclist is already on the move, and is asking when they have control over their bicycle.\n2. The options before they begin pedaling, leave the driveway, when they pass through intersection, and midway down the trail are choices that relate to the beginning stages of a biker's journey, while other choices relate to when their ride is already underway.\n3. This means that the bicyclist has the least control over their bike when they are just beginning it, or when they are midway through their trip.  \n4. In the options after they begin pedaling, it refers to where the person has left one foot on the pedal and one foot on the road, and this indicates when the bicylcist has more control over their bike, since they've likely gotten the feel of the bike and its dynamics by now. 5. The options when they lift up their feet or upon arrival indicate the moment where the rider has stopped and put their foot down, which indicates less control during the actual ride. 6.

Similarly, we can then discard D: doorknobs as they are part of the doorway and E: doorways which, while they may be doorways, are not an object that exists within a doorway. This leaves us with three options between C: open doors and C: opening doors.\n4. Looking again at these two options C: open doors and opening doors.\n5. We can assume that the options are used in the context of a door opening on a window or a door that is a frame that opens by moving on hinges.\n6. If we look at the question, we can see that the options do not refer to a time period like past or future, and they do not relate to a physical event like an action or a gesture.\n7. Therefore, we can infer that these are options describing parts or actions related to the doorway, which is already understood as the location where the object exists.\n8. So, we can then eliminate C: opening doors, since the location of an open doorway is understood because the door is still in the open position.\n9. The only option left is C: open doors.\n10. This makes sense because an open doorway is the physical location where an object is contained.\n11. So, the answer is C: open doors\nAnswer: C: open doors", "answer": " 600"}

If the object is inside the doorway, we could grab it using option E: doorway.\n4. However, if the object is outside of the doorway, using option E would not be feasible.\n5. Hence, among the remaining options, B: control panel, is most appropriate.\n6. Control panel is the part of a door that one operates to open and close the door. The control panel is within the doorway.\n7. Therefore, we should select option B: control panel.\nAnswer: B", "answer": " 63"}
{"text": "object that exists outside of the doorway and it is a large object that is difficult to pick up.\n3. We can also eliminate option C: opening doors. While technically, an opening door may contain objects, it is not one that is meant to be grabbed, since opening the door requires us to push it or pull it.\n4. The same can be said of option D: doorknobs and doorways.\n5. Therefore we can eliminate options C: opening doors, D: doorknabs and doorknows and E: doorways or what's inside them.\n6. We can also eliminate B: control panels since these are usually located close to the door but not contained within the doorway.\n7. So, we are left with A: television and A: TV.\n8. We notice that \"TV\" and \"television\" are used synonymously in this question. So, we can eliminate A: TV, and the answer to the question would be A: television.\nAnswer: A; television\n\nInput: Where can you receive cash back at a kiosk? Choices:  Lounge E: A: Club O: B : Restaurant C: D: Bar Q: F: Restaurant\nRationales: First, we need to identify the parts of the question and break down the sentence to answer the question. Here, it reads: \"Where can you receive cashback at a kiosk?\"\n1. This indicates that the question is asking about a kiosk, rather than about the location in which the kiosk is found.\n2. Looking at the remaining options, we can eliminate option A: Lounge, B: Restaurant, C: Bar, D: Club O: Lounge, and E: Restaurant as they are not answers but are locations where a kiosk cannot be found.\n3. Therefore we are left with only one option, F: Restaurant that is an answer to the question. The answer to this question is F: Restaurant.\nAnswer: F: Restaurants\n\n\nInput: What is an example of a good source of protein?

We can also eliminate option D: doorknobs and doorways, since it is not likely that we would grab an object contained by the doorway.\n4. This narrows it down to options: C: opening door and E: doorway. We choose the option that is more likely to have the object contained, which in this case is the doorway.\n5. Thus option E: doorway is the final answer.\nAnswer:\n\nE: doorway\n\nInput: Who didn't the witch pick if she needed a friend? Choices:  a: the spider  b: the cat  c: the pig  d: the frog  e: none\nRationales: First, the question asks who the witch didn't pick if she needed a new friend.\nSince we are given five options to choose from, we can eliminate choice (a) since she didn't pick anyone.\nThere's a slight problem here: (b) says 'if she needed' and (e) refers to the witch 'picking'. (b) cannot be correct. (c) and (d) are both 'who' and 'what' in the same sentence. The choices are inconsistent and the question is confusing. Since this is a very old story, we can be flexible. (c) seems to fit in context, so we choose it.\nAnswer:\nC: the pig\n\nInput: Where has Dot the cat gone? Can you find her? Choices: \n   \n  * A: the couch \n    * B: the car \n    * C: the back yard \n    * D: the kitchen \n    * E: around the house.\nRationales: To start solving this, look at the first question, which asks where Dot the cat is.\nSince it does not end with a question mark, we can assume that the answer will be a singular place, in this case the backyard.\nSince we know the answer to the first question at this point, Dot is not in the car, the kitchen or the living room.\nSince Dot is not in any of those places, this rules out the options A: The couch B: the", "answer": " 2210"}

Option D: doorknobs, are parts of the door itself, not things we can grab, so we can eliminate this answer.\n6. Hence, that leaves us with the two remaining choices as doorways and doorways.\n6.

China 3. United Kingdom 4. Canada 5. Germany\nRationales: The question is attempting to identify which country made the number of cars per thousand people a crime.\n\n1. Option 1: The first sentence indicates that there was a country where this number was considered a crime.\n2. The sentence goes on to specify that the country in question is South Africa and since South Africa is in Africa, it was technically the first country in the continent to make this a crime.\n3. Option 2: The second sentence refers to the second largest country from 1, where there are more cars than people. China is one of the two most populous countries in the world and so we can assume the government did not make an action to make the number of vehicle owners a crime.\n4. Option 3: The third sentence refers to the second country to have more cars than people. Britain is the UK's name for this country, and it is correct in all senses of the word as 'UK' is an abbreviation for 'United Kingdom. 4. It appears to be the second country to have people with more vehicles than people - so Option 3: United Kingdom is in the wrong place. The sentence says it is the other country to have this (ie first).\n5. If however, the number of cars is actually considered a crime, it could be possible to commit that crime in Britain as we cannot conclude that British law is similar in all the British countries.\n6. Option 4: The fourth sentence refers to the number of cars there are for every", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "object that we can't reach by simply grabbing it.\n3. We then need to determine the type of object that we can grab inside a doorway. Therefore, we look at the other given options: doorknob, control panel, opening doors, doorknob and doorway.\n4. Let's take the given options one by one: doorknob is an option where we can grasp the handle. However, the question says we are grabbing the object and not the doorknob.\n5. Doorknob doesn't sound plausible.\n6. Moving to option C: opening doors, we can't directly grab the doors.\n7. Similarly, option D: doorway, doesn't seem like the right answer either.\n8. The only plausible option that allows us to simply grab the object contained by a door is the given option E: doorway.\n9. Therefore our answer to the question is option D: doorway.\nAnswer: D. doorway\n\nInput: He ate lots of apples and did what to his face? Choices: \nA: wiped the juice B: left an apple stain C: cut a big hole D: picked out seeds E: found dirt\nRationales: I. First of all, juice would probably drip down the individual's shirt if he or she consumed all those apples. That way it could easily stain his or her shirt for the rest of the day. Consequently, we can eliminate option A: wiped the liquid.\n\nII. Option B: left a stain would probably refer to a long-lasting apples stain on his or her face. However, this would imply that he or she had some kind of cut and left an apple on their face. Moreover, the amount of apples he or she consumed should have at least made him or her sick. Therefore, we can eliminate option C: left a big hole.\n\nIII. The fact that he or she ate all those apples would make it very likely that he or she a) did not consume some parts of the fruit and b) consumed some kind of waste, which could be seeds and dirt. Hence, we can choose either option E: found dirt or option D: found seeds.\n\nIV. Finally", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": "object that we see being used in front of a doorway, but it's not contained or contained by a doorway in the picture.\n3. Option B: control panel can be eliminated as the object shown in the picture doesn't seem to contain a control panel.\n4. Option C: opening doors could be an option of the question asked, as sometimes you need to open the door to reach an object that's contained in a doorway. However, it doesn't make too much sense to grab an object contained in a doorway as you open a door. It would just be easier to grab the object as you step inside the doorway.\n5. Since option C doesn't stand out as a good option for the question, that narrows down the answer to two choices: \"doorknob\" and \"doorway\". \n6. Doorknobs can technically be used to grab an object contained by the doorway, but the question wants to focus on objects that are typically placed outside the actual doorway.\n7. So, it would make more sense to choose option E: doorway, where one would typically place objects such as a trash can or a mailbox outside the doorway.\n8. That eliminates our answer to 'grab an object contained by the doorkway', which is E: doorway.\nAnswer: E - doorway\n\nInput: In order to start working to what?

First,'start working' is an action that an individual should undertake, and they should be working using a 'computer'.\n2. For an \"individual\" to work on a computer, they should use a 'keyboard'. However, since a 'pencil' is an instrument used for writing and typing, a pencil could be counted as a keyboard.\n3. Hence, we can rule out all the options starting with letter 'C'.\n4. Now we arrive at four options: letters 'D' and 'E' and option A: 'keyboard'. For the sake of completeness, we consider the option: 'keyboard'.\n5. Since an individual uses their finger to push the keys on a keyboard, such a keyboard is more likely to be used in", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": "object that we wouldn't grab through a doorway.\n3. Similarly, option B: control panel is an unsuitable option because it is a control that might be used either inside or outside a doorway, but isn't a doorway itself.\n4. Option C: opening doors is unsuitable as 'opening doors' as a description of an object does not clearly tell us that the contained object is a door itself.\n5. Option D: doorknobs is also unsuitable since we would be holding on to the doorknob to open the door, not grab an object contained by it.\n6. So, we are left with options B: control panel and E: doorway.\n7. Now, let's reason how the question can be answered.\n8. The point of the question is to determine where we would grab an unspecified object contained by a door.\n9. A doorway is not an unspecified object, but it does contain objects. Since it is not an unspecific object, we can't use it to obtain what we are looking for.\n10. So, we can eliminate option E: doorway. This leaves us to search for an object contained by a controlled panel.\n11. The given options are the control panel (an object contained by a door) itself.

{"text": "object contained by another doorway (a television stand) and, therefore, will be contained by the doorway a different question asks about.\n3. Option B: control panel has nothing to do with the door and the object doesn't appear to be contained by the door either.\n4. We don't open the doors of a doorway. Hence, option D: doors is ruled out.\n5. Option C: opening doors does not lead to grasping the object contained by the doorway either.\n6. We understand that the object of interest is contained by the doorway and is therefore contained somewhere within the confines of the doorway. Now, we can eliminate option E: doorway since we already found that there is something that isn't included in the doorway. We're searching for an object that IS included in the doorway, so, anything not inside the doorway has been ruled out.\n7. Thus, the remaining options are B: control panel and D: doorknobs which both refer to within the doorway itself. \n8. Option D: doorknub can be eliminated. A doorknob is the end of a door handle and it's therefore not part of an object contained by a doorknob. Therefore, we can eliminate this choice.\n9. Thus left with option B: control panel, we know that both these options describe something or some part that can be grasped. \n10. Moreover, the control panel is a movable object and fits all other requirements as well.\n11. So, the correct choice would be B: control panel since the control panel is a moveable piece, it can be easily grabbed from the doorway.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: Which of these names best represent the type of person that would prefer not to use the word \"hypothesis\" during a science lesson?

{"text": "object in a room.\n3. Option B: control panel, is not contained by a doorway and therefore can't be chosen.\n4. Options C: opening doors and D: doorknobs would be appropriate choices if the doorway were open, but, since the doorway is considered, this indicates that the door is closed.\n5. This, in turn, means that whatever the object is contained by the doorway, it is not something that is usually opened and shut on a frequent basis.\n6. Since the object is not something we usually open and shut in this manner, this indicates the object is something fixed. As we are grabbing an object from a doorway, we can assume the object cannot be moved around easily without it appearing to be within the doorway.\n7. This eliminates choices C: opening doors and B: control panel.\n8. This also suggests, then, that the room with the doorway would usually have the object that is \"contained\" by the doorway in a certain position. \n9. This would be a fixed position, where the object would remain until we grabbed it.\n10. Option E: doorway would be in the same fixed position as the object. So now, we only have A: television and D: doorknoB.\n11. The television is fixed and would be in the same position when the doorway is open or closed, eliminating that option.

Choices: \tA: advertise more B: advertise C: hire more D: employ all E: provide extra\nRationales: Reasoning Steps 1. The question focuses on the store owner, how likely they are to receive more sales if they do something.\n2. The options given are: advertising more, advertising, hiring more staff, employing all the staff, and providing extra help.\n\n3. To determine the answer, we need to make a judgment between options B: advertising and E: providing extra help.\n4. As the question asks about receiving extra sales, advertising may not be necessary or important. \n5. We need to consider the meaning of \"providing extra help,\" and whether it is incompatible with advertising, or more important. \n6. We can define \"providing extra help\" as going \"above and beyond\" the level of assistance typically expected in stores, such as helping customers with heavy or bulky items, running to get a forgotten item, or being prepared to explain a complicated or unfamiliar purchase.\n7. Therefore \"providing extra help\", can be considered as one that is likely to help the store owner generate more sales. \n8. We can conclude that option E: providing extra help is likely to help the owner increase sales.\n9. Consequently, option E: providing extra is the more likely method to help the owner receive more sales.\n10.

Option C: opening doors, refers to the ability to open and close the door. In this scenario, the door is the main thing we're interacting with rather than the interior items contained in the door. So, we can eliminate option C: opening doors.\n5. Doorways are the places or spaces used in and around door objects. Since we would be grabbing an object contained by a specific doorway, we'd be touching the interior objects contained by the doorway.\n6. Therefore option D: door is most applicable here since it refers to something we touch while inside a space like the doorway.\n7.

Choice A: land is incorrect as we aren't using something physical to go over any land.\n4. No human could survive outside of a space suit if they decided to jump off the ground and start floating over the ground without the presence of an earth's atmosphere. \n5.

The words \"door\" and \"doorway\" are interchangeable in this context. \n6. Therefore, we can eliminate options B, D, E from the choices.\n7.

E: put toys in a small bucket 11. F: climb on your toes 12. F: sit on a rock\nRationales: First, it is important to identify the question. The question asks us about two things that one might see in the woods that is related to a specific action the student did.\nNext, we need to look through the options and determine whether each option has anything that is related to the two things the student saw.\n1. If you were to spend time swimming, you'd inevitably have seen objects in the water. So, this option can be eliminated. It does not mention anything from the woods, which is of importance to what we did.\n2. This option is related to the woods. But it does not mention anything that the student would have seen in the woods.\n3. This option mentions small animals, but it doesn'", "answer": " 20"}

Eliminate option E: Doorway, as it's asking for an object that is contained in a doorway and not an object that could be contained in a doorway.\n6. Option D: Doorknob is an item, which most certainly can be found contained in or in the vicinity of a doorway, making it a logical choice.\n7.

Choices:  T: a rabbit B: a tiger C: a wolf D: a sheep E: a lion\nRationales: Easy: When the word \"first\" is meant to imply the beginning, it typically refers to the first occurrence of an object or person by order in time (not necessarily by sequence of birth or by order of importance).\nTherefore, the answer to the puzzle is E: A Lion.\n\nInput: This is an example of a common type: T: The boss and employees got together because of what?

{"text": "object that is not part of a doorway.\n3. Next, we notice option C: opening doors, which could technically encompass an item that is contained by a specific doorway. But that doorway could be for any door or even a window.\n4. As a result, we can eliminate option C: opening doors.\n5. Now we can look at the other choices.\n6. Option D: doorknobs would be too abstract to be considered as a grab point.\n7. Option B: control panels could also refer to a door's electronic mechanism. But in either case, these are not necessarily contained by a doorway if they are connected to the mechanism elsewhere.\n8. Finally, option E: doorways would be our answer.\nAnswer:E: doorways\n\nInput: He doesn't want a small amount in his house, how much? Choices:  small, less, big, much, medium\nRationales: When a number is presented followed by the word \"in\" and then a noun or pronoun, we interpret the phrase to mean an amount of that thing located at the address or location specified by the number.\nFor example, \"5 meters in the kitchen\" would be interpreted to mean 5 meters in the kitchen.\n1. The question is clearly asking for a numerical amount of something in addition to the place that amount would occupy.\n2. A smaller amount may be contained in a smaller place and a larger amount would be contained by a larger place.\n3. By analysing the remaining choices, we can determine that only'small' and 'large' would allow for a numerical amount to occupy the indicated location.\n4. 'Small amount' contains the word'small', meaning that it would be reasonable to assume that it is the smaller option of the available choices.\n5. Hence, the phrase'small amount' refers to the smallest amount, which would logically be the smallest possible amount and would occupy the smallest possible space.\n6. This supports the answer'small'.\nAnswer: small\n\nInput: What does an aphrodisiac not work immediately for?

Now looking at a few more options:\n5. Option C: Opening doors, refers to an action of opening and closing the door.\n6. Option D: doorknobs, is related to turning the doorknob as you open the door.\n7. Option D does have a similar relationship with Option C: doorknobs but Option D talks about the effect of having a door handle or doorknob (in the form of a door knob), whereas Option C refers to an action of 'opening and closing'.\n8. Option E: doorways, seems the best fit as it refers to a gap or space where a door is placed and it's where an item can become contained. \n9. Therefore, the best answer is E: doorway.\nAnswer: E. doorway\n\nInput: How does an automated teller machine take cash? Choices: 1. A: deposit it to a bank account 2. B: withdraw it 3. C: deposit it into a savings account 4. D: move it to someone else 5. E: hold onto it tightly\nRationales: The question asks how an Automated Tell Machine (ATM) takes cash. ATMs are generally machines designed to dispense money at automated banks, so they do not actually take cash but actually disburse it through some sort of withdrawal system. ATMs can sometimes be used to deposit money into bank accounts but this is not their main goal, hence the answer is that they don\u2019t take cash.\nAnswer 1: A. ATMs do not take cash and, therefore, the answer is false.\nAnswer 2: B. ATMs do disburse cash, not deposit. \nAnswer 3: C. There is no mention that ATMs deposit funds directly into a specific account so, the answer is false\nAnswer 4: D. ATMs do NOT transfer funds from person to person directly, the answer is false\u2026 but if they could answer would be\u2026 D.\nAnswer 5: E. No matter what, ATMs", "answer": " 15"}

We then have the options E: doorway and F: nothing.\n7. Option E: Doorway is the space between doors through which items can be pushed or grabbed.\n8. Option F: nothing wouldn't be part of the solution since nothing is what we are grabbing. This leaves option E: doorway.\n9.

C: set a budget 4. D: manage other employees 5. E: plan schedules 6. F: pay a bill 7. G: create a memo\nRationales:\n1. In the field of business, experts typically solve problems and/or come up with strategies for managing people or systems, as well as creating documents and plans that outlines the steps to be taken or decisions to be made.\n2. Writing a check, paying a bill, and managing employees are common tasks that many people may do in the field of finances or accounting.\n3. However, these tasks do not require expert-level knowledge or skill in the field of business and cannot be considered tasks that an expert in the field of business would be expected to undertake. \n4. Also, setting a budget, planning schedules, and managing other employees are often tasks that are part of accounting, finance or human resources, but do not necessarily involve solving problems or developing strategies in the field of business.\n5. Therefore: A: write a check, B: solve a problem, C: set a budget, D: manage other employees, E: plan schedules, F: pay a bill, and G: create a memos might not be the correct answer options here.\n\nAnswer:\n2.

Option B is a control panel, so we can eliminate this too.\n4. Option C is \"opening doors,\" which isn't an object contained by a Doorway, so we can eliminate that too.\n5. Option D is the same thing as the Doorknob, which is the only object that would be capable of being contained by a doorway and could be grabbed with our hand.\n6. Since the choice is between E and D, we can eliminate E: doorway, because it's already a choice to grab the Doorknob out of a Doorway.\n7. Thus, the appropriate choice to make is option D: Doorknob.\nAnswer: D. Doorknob\n\nInput: There is what found on a carburetor? Choices:  D: filter A: motor B: piston E: carburetor C: gasket F: exhaust pipe\nRationales: To start solving this question, we can just eliminate options A - E as those are all options that wouldn't be on the carburetor. We may be correct so far, but we need to check the definitions to ensure that the only choice that could logically be on the carb was a carburetor option. A carburetor is the part of a car's engine that helps the engine run, so the thing on the carbureture must help the car run. A filter is a device that screens out impurities, so it isn't logical that this would be found on a carb or carburetor. A motor is a device that makes a part of the car move, so it also wouldn't be logical for that to be found as a filter on an option that's about filtering. A gasket is a device, similar to a seal, that creates a tight seal so a gas or liquid can't leak; it wouldn't make sense for the part where a gas could leak from the car to also seal with a gasket in addition to that. This leaves us with F: exhaust pipe and B: piston, but we need to remember back to the original logic.\n\n\"There is what found on a", "answer": " 9"}

However, option B: control panel does not relate to a doorway since it's typically found at the back of and not contained by a doorway in the home, while option C: opening door does not contain any object that is not being grabbed.\n5. So we can eliminate those.\n6. From B, D, and A we are left with a bunch of objects that could be grabbed for use in the home.\n7. So we narrow the choices down to those related to doorways that we can grab inside a home and from those we eliminate option A: doorknob, which refers to the handle of a door and has a more precise technical meaning, which is unlikely to be what the sentence wants us to find.\n8. This leaves option D: doorknobs. \n9. In a home, people could grab a door handle or a doorknob to grab an object.\n10.

A crab and a craw fish are both animals. 2. An animal has a head (sometimes with sense organs), a body (sometimes with bones), and usually appendages. 3. Some or all animals have two types of appendages: limbs and non-limbs. Limbs are the animal's appendages used for moving it around, e.g. feet, forelimbs, hindlimbs.

{"text": "object that is typically larger than a doorway, and it doesn't fit in a doorway. \n3. We can also eliminate option B: control panel. This option is too general and it doesn't refer to a specific type of object that we can grab with our hand.\n4. Moving to option C: opening doors, this option doesn't involve grabbing an object and it doesn't indicate a specific part of a door through which we would make the grab. So we can eliminate this choice as well.\n5. Moving on to option D: doorknobs. When we reach for a doorknob, we usually grab it with our fingers, so the doorknob itself is not necessarily the object that's contained by the doorway. \n6. Option E: the doorway itself would be the object that is contained by the doorway, which is why it's the most appropriate answer. \n7. Thus, the correct answer to the question is option E: the doorway.\nAnswer: E; doorway\n\nInput: Where should one leave a note when they have decided to vacation next summer? Choices: \nA: calendar B: postbox C: mailbox D: backpack E: bookshelf\nRationales: Let's look at each option step by step. \n1. The question is basically asking what one should do to leave a note of a future event.\n2. There are various places where one could potentially leave such a note, such as a bookshelf, backpack, computer, etc.\n3. Therefore we have to narrow it down to some kind of stationery, for which there are a few suitable options such as a calendar, mailbox, and postbox.\n4. As these choices don't refer to physical items like the backpack, the other choices do not include them. Hence we eliminate options A and D. \n5. We further eliminate option B: postbox since it's a specific place and the note would need to be placed there, instead of read from it. \n6. Therefore, option C remains, which is related to leaving a note for mailing later rather than storing it. \n7. This leaves us with choice C: mailbox which is the most appropriate answer for the question \"Where should one leave a note?\"\nAnswer: C: mailbox\n\nInput", "answer": " 2"}

We can further assume that the doorway is one we pass through regularly and not an emergency exit doorway, so, we can eliminate option A: emergency exit. \n4. The question mentions an object, so option A: doorknob isn't appropriate either since it's unclear what kind of object we would grab and whether we would even need to grab it to answer the question.\n5. Option A: doorknok should be eliminated.\n6. Moving on to option B: control panel, we can eliminate it since we're being asked to describe where an object in a doorway would be and a control panel would likely be inside the door, thus out of the question.\n7. Option B: control panel should be eliminated. \n8. Now, we are down to only options C: opening doors and D: doorknobs, and we can rule out D: doorknobe since the question only mentions objects contained by the doorway and we don't know yet if the object would need to be something specific. \n9.

These choices convey more specific actions that an object is performing, rather than the location of an object relative to a doorway\n7. Moving to option E: doorway, a doorway is a structure, or set of structures, that usually consists of an entrance to a room or building.\n8. Typically, we refer to the entrance or threshold as the \"doorway\". So, we can take E: doorway. \n9. Looking at the available options, option A: control panel can be eliminated. \n10. Moving on to option B: doorknob, a doorknob is placed on the outside of a door (the thing being closed), and not the inside (the thing being closed).\n11.

Moving to option D: doorknobs, is a viable option but is an object more specific to a door and not something we'd normally grab to walk through a doorway and into a room.\n5. Finally, option B: control panel, would actually be used by someone who wanted to close the door rather than open it, and we didn't say that we wanted to walk in through the door, just grab something contained by the doorway, so this option can also be eliminated.\n6.

An opening door is the part of the doorway that is opening, while a doorway is the whole area where the opening door is situated.\n7. Now, for the question at hand, we're specifically looking for an object that's contained by a doorway, so an opening door or the doorway itself doesn't fulfill this requirement.\n8. Going back to C: opening doors, here the phrase \"contained by\" is important. We want an object, to be contained by, a doorway.\n9.

While doorknob and doorknob both refer to the same object, it is also possible to open a door using the doorknob so you should be able to grab that once you open the door.\n6. Doorknobs are not considered a doorway, so we can eliminate option E: doorway from the question.\n7. Now, we are left with option B: control panel, and option D: doorknobs.\n8.

Similarly, we can eliminate option D: doorknobs since they are physical things that we cannot grab without touching them first.\n4. The other remaining options are all nouns, and thus we can eliminate them from consideration since \"grab\" requires a verb or action based on whether you are doing an action like picking something up.\n5. After that, options options B and E: doorway can be eliminated as doorways don't contain things on their own. Doorways are typically either open or closed, but they do not contain objects on their own.\n6.

Choices:  C: slow and thoughtful B: lack of it D: annoying E: boredom\nRationales: The question asks us for the meaning of the word patience. Since a word is a noun and can be used as a name, they may be looking for its name. For example, we know that \"bird\" is a name for a living creature and \"basketball\" can be a name for a game in which a ball is bounced. Thus, we need to find out that a word is a name for a particular type of concept and that is by looking at their definition. The dictionary definition for the word \"patience\", is (according to the definition)... \"behaviour that shows you are willing to wait or accept something even when it is difficult for you\" That means it is a name for a characteristic that you can only exhibit when something is difficult for you. Thus, the answer to the word puzzle is D: a lack of it.\n\nAnswer: D: a lack of patience.\n\nInput: Which of the following is a key component of a compost heap?

Therefore we have a four object puzzle with a door and the objects A: television, B: control panel, and C: open doors contained from A to C.

Look\n2. Puzzle in a game\n\n2nd step: identify the most important of each of the two key terms. In a case such as this one, one key term refers to the action required, while the other is the concept it relates to.\n\n1. 'Look' is a very broad phrase that could refer to literally anything. However, since the question asked HOW to look at a puzzle, the appropriate phrasing would be 'the method of looking at a puzzle in the game'. \n2. So, we now have the more relevant key terms'method' and 'puzzle', and 'look at' as the action.\n3. The relationship between them is that looking at the puzzle would imply noticing something, recognizing it, or in some way, engaging with the task at hand. This in turn is the method by which we solve the puzzle.\n4th step: Identify the possible methods to engaging with the puzzle, in terms of 'look at'. \n5. From the given options, we see that our method is defined as a way of engaging. \n6.", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "item that is not inside a doorway\n3. Now, moving to option B: control panel, it is an object that is inside a doorway and we can use it to grab objects. \n4. However, a control panel is a flat area that does not have any openings for items to be grabbed. Thus, we can eliminate option  B: control panel. \n5. Similarly, option C: opening doors are not physical doorways and don't contain doorframes and therefore, we can eliminate option C: opening doors\n6. When the question says object contained by a door way, we need to understand that we will be using this door frame to reach any object behind it.\n\n7. So option D: doorknobs can be eliminated as well. \n8. Now, let's move on to choose between two doors - A: doorway and E: doorway. \n   9. If it is an object in a doorway, then it has to be in either door. \n10. Since if we open the door, then we will see the object.\n11. Now, if we open the door and then look for the object, then we'll find it only in doorway A.\n12. Therefore, option A: the doorway is the best answer.\nAnswer: A; Doorway", "answer": " 5"}

We can further eliminate option B: control panel, because a control panel typically doesn't contain an object that could be \"grabbed\".\n4. Eliminating these two choices, we can then consider the options C: opening doors and D: doorknobs.\n5. Option E: doorway seems like it is an option where you could grab something. \n6.

Choices: A: yes B: no\nRationales: First, we need to break down the premise of the statement to understand what it is asking about. 1. The statement \"When you have a great amount money, are you obligate to hand out the money\" is basically asking whether you should distribute or share money that we have a large amount of. \n2. A good way to interpret the word \"obligate\" is to consider a scenario where there are legal responsibilities involved with it. For example, if you rent out your property or loan money to someone you have a legal obligation to uphold. In these situations, you would need to perform some obligatory action related to your agreement to rent or loan the money to someone. \n3. In this question, the statement mentions \"handing out\". So, we can interpret the action of \"handing out\" to mean sharing, distributing an amount of money. \n4. Therefore, the correct choice would have to be \"B: no\", because we are asking whether you have to hand out the money, not whether you have done it.\nAnswer: B. No, I don't have to hand out money\n\n### Instructed: If you were to be on a jury, which case are you most likely going to be on?\n\nIntermediate Reason:\n1. Case: A jury trial", "answer": " 750"}

{"text": "object that is contained within a television set and not by a doorway. \n3. We can also eliminate options D: doorknobs, as doorknobs are typically used to open the door and not contain objects. \n4. Further, we should eliminate option B: control panel, as the panel controls the door and is not the structure itself, and thus it does not 'contain' within the doorway. \n5. Therefore, it is necessary to look at how the option C: doorway defines the structure of this object. \n6. It refers to the opening and not the door itself, which would be indicated by the option E. \n7. A doorway is simply an opening or passageway through a wall or partition, typically from one room to another and not a defined object. \n8. Thus, the only option left with the context of these definitions is option C: doorway.\nAnswer: C: doorway\n\nInput: Can you make up for a bad review over your years of work experience? Choices: 1- A: no 2- B: yes 3- C: no 4- D: probably \nRationales: The question asks about whether it is possible to make up for a bad work review. Here is how we can solve this: \n1. To start solving the question we first need to understand the rhetorical value of the options. \n2. We can see that the options are ranked according to their levels of certainty as reflected by their position from left to right. \n3. Options A: no, and D: probably are the most uncertain ones since their place on either end would be enough to rule out their possibility. \n4. Options B: yes and C: no, have more confidence but still cannot be the answer as we can understand from how their answers compare with the question. \n5. Since the question is binary and seeks to find a YES or NO answer, option C: no will be the answer since, although this option does not confirm the ability to make up for a review, it does not rule it out either.\n6.

This implies the control panel is in a doorway. But there are various kinds of doorways that would have a control panel behind them. So, option B can be eliminated. \n4. Doorways usually have a hinged panel, so we can eliminate option C: opening doors.\n5. The question is asking about objects in a doorway, not objects near the doorway. So option D: doorknobs can be eliminated as they are typically on the doors themselves and not on the actual object.\n6. In most doorways, there is typically one opening into the doorway. So, option E: doorway can be eliminated because it is asking us to find something inside a doorway and not in a doorway.\n7. Finally, we can eliminate option A: television. This is too large and heavy to be grabbed by the hand.\n8. So the answer is option B: control panel door.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: One should not have to do anything with a cake that has not been in the oven for very long. Choices:  A. bake it B. make it C. eat it D. cool it E. eat it\nRationales: First, we want to find out if the choices are plausible regarding the sentence.\n1.  Cake is a baked food.\n2.  Cake cannot be made without baking.\n3.  It is not necessary to eat it after baking it.\n4.  It is not clear what cool it means here.\n5.  Based on the context and the grammar, we can see that it is not necessary to eat the cake once it is baked.\n6.  It is therefore correct to say that one could keep a cake that has just been baked. This would mean that one can take the cake out of the oven before it is baked. \n7. Based on the choices, we can eliminate options C and D.\n8.

But doorknobs also don't necessarily need to be contained by a doorway to be useful in opening a door. So, it can be eliminated too.\n5. Option E: doorways only describe a place of entry or exit.

We can reject option C: opening doors as it doesn't make sense to grab a door in order to open it.\n5. Option D: \"doorknob\" would be an appropriate place to grab something if you were holding an object and attempting to use that object in order to open it, but there's a problem: the wording of the question clearly doesn't indicate we have an object.\n6.

It wouldn't make sense to say that if we are inside a doorway we would grab the door, which itself is just a frame that holds a door in place.\n5. Option E: doorways should be eliminated.

At this point, we can choose between B: control panel and doors, depending on the context of the situation.\n8. For example, if the question said that the object was within a warehouse, it would probably be B: control panel.\n9.

There's a slight possibility it's meant to be referring to a control panel in a plane in which case it would make sense with the previous option choice.\nAnswer: C: control panels\n\nInput: What do you need to be successful? Choices:  B: luck C: knowledge D: talent E: effort F: ability\nRationales: First, we need to understand what the question is asking. The question asks what you need to be successful.\n1. You need things in order to be successful. Some good ones are:\n2. luck, knowledge, talent, ability, effort.\n3. They all have some kind of relation to being successful.\n4. Out of these 5 options, luck is not an option we can select as it doesn't relate to being successful.\n5. Knowledge is the next option we can select as we can easily identify that knowledge is needed in being successful.\n6. Similarly, talent isn't directly an input but it is an output that can be used to be successful.\n7. Similarly, both ability and effort can be used to be able to be successful.\n8. Hence, 2 of the options left are knowledge and ability.\n9. Out of these two, knowledge is the one that directly relates to being successful whereas ability is the output that can only be obtained through some kind of knowledge.\n10. Therefore, we pick knowledge.\nAnswer: B is option A, C is option B, D is option C, and E and F don't apply to this question hence are wrong.\n\n\nInput: The person decided to do the task after realizing it was what he wanted to do.

{"text": "object that is not contained by the doorway.\n3. We can next eliminate option B: control panel, because a control panel is not contained by the open space of the doorway.\n4. Next, option C: opening doors is misleading, as it could mean opening the door first, and then grabbing the object from within. When the person is performing this action, they would not be 'grabbing' an object \"contained by a doorway\" - they would be grabbing an object located outside of the doorway. This option doesn't directly suggest where they would grab an object that's within the space of a doorway. \n5. Option D: doorknobs is potentially a good answer because it's part of the doorway. However, the problem with this choice is the wording - \"grab an object\" would be an action performed on the exterior of the door, not to the doorknob. We also need to consider the location of the object in question. Would it be just within the space of the doorway, or would it be in an area where someone could open the door and grab the object?\n6. In this context, the choice that makes the most sense, and aligns the best with the question, is E: \"doorway\". Since it refers to the entire doorway and the space around it.\n7. Since the object we need to grab is \"contained by the doorway\", we would be able to grab it from within the doorway - as long as we reach over or through the doorway to the object, which can be done from any space within the doorway or around the doorway.\n8. Therefore the correct answer is E: \"doorways\".\nAnswer: E: doorways\n\nInput: The group of friends were on a trip when something went wrong, what might happen to someone who is scared?

Options C: opening doors, and D: doorknobs will take some explaining to understand what they actually mean in this context.\n5. It takes some effort to open a door, typically by using a mechanism on the door, a doorknob or handle, but they can also be opened manually with force.\n6. Once you've fully opened the door, it typically still has a \"door opening\" or \"door opening area\" around it if it's wide enough. \n7. So, option C: opening doors can be eliminated as well, as it does not describe something that is clearly contained by a doorway in any sense.\n8. Hence, out of all available options, it's only option D: doorknobb that meets our requirements: it physically attaches to the door, creating a doorway or a doorway-like area, giving us a \"grab\" for something that we can contain or hold.\n9.

Option C: open door is out because it is an action one could take to open a door. It doesn't help us answer what location we would grab an object in. \n7. Option D: doorknobs is irrelevant to the question; if there's enough space and we are free to move around, we can reach and grab anything in the vicinity, regardless of its location.\n8. We're left with option E: doorway. The doorway is the most likely place we can grasp an object that is contained inside of it.

A door allows for opening and closing, and therefore, this cannot be part of an object that is contained and controlled within the door.\n6. Option D: doorknobs controls the movement of the door itself, and would not be a controlled object within the doorway.\n7.

Option B: Control panel seems to work, as it is contained by an open doorway, but option B: control panel has the problem that it cannot be grabbed.\n6. It is an object that is located on the side of the doorway, not in it.\n7. We can eliminate B: Control panel. \n8. Option C: opening doors doesn't give us the information we need, as it does not say what is actually contained by a doorway, not just an object contained by a closed door.\n9. Therefore we can leave only A: doorway and E: doorway.\n10. If we take a closer look, we see that if an object is contained by a door and it's closed, it's contained in the doorway (opening), because this is the only physical space that it occupies. \n11.

Choices:  a. moisture b. deodorant c. hair d. air conditioning e. sweat \nRationales: For example, if you're having trouble solving this question, let's think about how you feel hot. Your body releases sweat, which acts as a cooling mechanism. 1. Here, we are faced with the options a, b, c, d, e. 2. The choices a, b and d can be ruled out as they all deal more with the effect of sweat, rather than the actual act of cooling as they all involve the removal of sweat in some form. 3. Similarly, option e can be ruled out since moisture has the same effect as sweat. 4. So the remaining choice between options c and b refers to whether you apply a chemical, like deodorant, or you use nature, like hair or your body to cool yourself. 5. Thus, option c is the only answer choice here that involves applying something to your body to cool down. \nAnswer: C: Hair\n\nAsked Question: \n```python\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('input, response', [\n    ([], ''),\n    (['a', 'b', 'c'], 'abc'),\n    (['d', 'e', 'f'], 'def'),\n    (['g', 'h', 'i'], 'ghi'),\n    (['j', 'k', 'l'], 'j", "answer": " 76"}

We can also eliminate option D: doorknobs since doorknobs are not objects contained by a doorway, but rather are necessary for opening the door. \n4. We can further eliminate option D: doors since while some doorknobs may open a door, doors in general are too large to fit into a doorway.\n5. To summarize, options B, C, E, and A remain as possibilities.\n6. We can first eliminate D: doorknabs and E: doorways since these are not objects.\n7. Now we are left with B, C, and A.\n8. These two options can be further grouped into: object and non-object.\n9. So, between the non-object and object groups we only have two options.\n10. Therefore, the answer between these two groups can only be B: control panel.\nAnswer: B. control panel\n\nInput: My boss is a pugilist. In which of these sports would these people compete? Choices: 1 and 2. 3. 4 and 5. 6 and 7.\nRationales:\n\n1. First, we need to find out the answer to the question'my boss is a pungentist'.\n2. A pungentist is usually someone who fights in boxing, and that's it. So we need to start with the choices that don't involve boxing.\n3. Mixed martial arts doesn't refer to anyone who fights. MMA is a sport where more than one type of physical activity, including boxing is used.\n4. Football, basketball and soccer are all sports where multiple players compete. Though these are team sports, they are not necessarily used in boxing.\n5. Therefore we can eliminate any of these choices.\n6. A pungent has something to do with fight.\n7. But a pugilist is someone who fights. So it looks like it's an alternative spelling that's used interchangeably.\n8. Since only B: Boxing and C: Boxing remain, and it's clear that C is boxing, there cannot be anything more than that, so the only correct option would be A: Boxing.\n9. So A:", "answer": " 32"}

Option D: doorknobs is also incorrect, as it simply refers to the feature of a door and cannot provide an accurate answer in this context.\n6. This leaves us with option E: doorway, which can provide the intended answer. So, we select it as the correct answer and the final answer is E: doorway.\nAnswer: E; doorway\n\nInput: What kind of person would not enjoy going to see a movie? Choices:  C: apathetic D: insensitive E: empathetic F: sensitive\nRationales: At its heart, the question asks us to find a type of person who would not enjoy watching movies. Looking at the options, the options seem straightforward.\nAnswer: The first step in solving the question is understanding the context of the question. It asks us \"Who wouldn't enjoy going to see a Movie?\" (A) A person who lacks empathy, (B) A person who is insensitive, and (C) A person who is apathetic could benefit from additional context.\nAnswer: The four options are: an empathetic (E), sensitive (F), or apathetic (C) person.\n\nInput: Where are you going to store your new recliner? Choices:  B: upstairs C: up downstairs D: away E: upstairs and downstairs\nRationales: To understand where a person is going to store their new recliner, we need to determine the specific location that suits their needs in terms of both functionality and convenience.\nAnswer: The options to consider are between 'upstairs' and 'downstairs'. Of these, storing the recliner upstairs would likely make the most sense to store it in a way that is accessible for storage for future use. Additionally, 'upstairs and downstair' provides another choice, which potentially makes this option less useful. 'Away' does not provide a specific indic", "answer": " 2000"}
{"text": "object that is not contained in a doorway.\n3. Similarly, we also exclude option B: control panel, as a control panel is typically not located in a doorway. \n4. Also, option C: opening doors cannot be included as this choice does not describe the specific object contained within a doorway.\n5. Next, we leave options D: doorknubs and E: doorway.\n6. A doorknub by itself is an object, but it's not contained by a doorway, which is the context. Doorknubs typically extend outwards from a door.\n7. The choice is doorway, which is quite obvious.\n8. We can infer that objects contained by doorways, like books for example, are located inside them.\n9. Hence, the answer is B:\"control panel\".\nAnswer: B: control panel\n\nQuestion: In my bedroom, I had only two windows in front of a bed that had a lamp in the corner of a wall.

How many pieces of glass does my bedroom have for these five windows?\n\n### Solution\n\nThe bedroom has 5 pieces of glass because the lamp is in the floor, and then there is the room where the stars are coming through and then the room where the birds are, with the house behind the walls there are two extra pieces.\n\nInput: During the day, the woman wanted to get into the car to meet friends at night.

She either walked or took public transport.\nThus, only options B, C and E can be used.\nOption B means she could take a bus or a taxi. So, we eliminated option C.\nOption E says she parked her car so she could not get into it. So, we eliminate option D from the answer list.\nThe only possibility that can work here is option E: parked.\nAnswer: E parked\n\nInput: The teacher asked the class to answer the question.

These are other types of objects that are not contained by a door.\n4. This leaves us with only option E: doorway.\n5. Doorway seems like the answer, but when we look at the answer choices, we can see there's one more option. It's called \"catch a door\". When you catch a door, you grab it. \n6. \"Catch a door\" and \"grab an object contained by a doosway\" mean the same thing, so catch a door should be one among the possible answers as the question is asking us what to grab.\n7. Therefore, we have the right answer: catch a door.\nAnswer: C: catch a door\n\nInput: What is the first person to eat all of the food?\nRationales: Answer: This question involves the phrase \"first person\". When we talk about a person, we're referring to an individual. Each person has their own set of characteristics, opinions, and behaviors. So, when we talk about the first person to do something, we imply that each person has a chance of being the first one to do it.\nThis question asks for the answer choice that states what \"first person\" should be.\nThere are three possible choices. \"me\", \"you\" and \"them\".\nHere we don't care who eats food first, but what person eats food first?\nSo we take out the name \"me\" and \"you\" and we are left with \"them\".\n\"Them\" is the first choice and the right answer.\nAnswer: B. \"them\"\n\nInput: What do humans do when they are angry?

Option B: control panel is already given as a choice and it isn't contained by a door, but rather it's a different feature of a door (option E: doorway). So, we can eliminate option C: control panels.\n4. Eliminating options A: television, B: control panel, and C: opening doors, we are left with options D: doorknobs, or E: doorway. \n5. \"Grab\" and \"doorway\" are similar verbs which mean we are looking for something that we could reach out to and grab, whether that be a feature of the doorway itself or any of the objects that are enclosed in the doorway. \n6. Both are options for us to reach out and grab, but option D: doorknub can only be done if the door is open. Option E: doorway, however, can be grabbed even if the door is closed. So, we can eliminate D: doorknubs from our choices.\n7. Therefore, the answer to the given choices is \"E: doorway\".\nAnswer: E: doorway\n\nInput: How can being self made help make an impact on a community? Choices: 1: It can improve life quality 2: It can help improve the community 3: It can bring more unity 4: It can create opportunities 5: It can make people more productive\nRationales: First, we need to understand what it means to be \"self-made\". This implies that the person was able to create or build something for themselves without help from others.\n1. Being self-made can give the person more confidence and a positive outlook on life. This can then have a ripple effect as the person uses their confidence and positivity to impact the community by making it better. An example of this is starting a small business that provides jobs to people in the community.\n2. Alternatively, being self-made can also help improve the community. This is because when a person is self-made, they typically have a lot of expertise and experience in a certain field. They can then use this expertise to help improve the infrastructure or environment of the community.

A doorknob, being part of a doorway, can only be grabbed within the doorway.\n6. There is no scope for choice E: Doorway either since a doorway does not contain objects.\n7.

Choices:  D: run around the world E: get lost G: walk J: use computer K: sit on floor\nRationales: Reasoning Steps 1. Looking at the given choices:\n2. \"Get out of my house\" implies that an individual wishes to vacate their residence.\n3. To make it out of their house, they would typically need to take at least one step outside, and possibly more if they wanted to go into another room or a different building.\n4. Looking for actions that could represent \"one step\" or \"two steps\", we can cross off options D: run around the World, J: use computer and K: sit on floor because they refer to actions that are not tied to a specific location.\n5. Now looking at the remaining options, we see that they all refer to actions that involve at least one more step than sitting on the floor of a location and they are all directed at some specific location, indicating that they would be considered valid responses.\n6. \"Walk\" involves at least one step towards a destination.\n7. While \"Jog\" involves at least one extra step, it also involves running faster than walking, so the action isn't quite the same.\n8. \"Run\" involves at least one and more than one step, depending on the speed chosen. \n9. \"Go\" and \"Leave\" refer to specific actions rather than generic directions, which indicates they would be valid options.\n10.

Choices:  B: out of the gym D: inside the gym E: on the gym F: at a yoga studio\nRationales: The question is asking where we would be more likely to do some exercise even with inadequate equipment. We can eliminate B: out of the Gym.\n1. First, if we had bad equipment in the gym, the obvious solution is to leave.\n2. This rule would also apply to a yoga studio or anywhere else.\n3. We can then exclude option E: Gym.\n4. Bad equipment implies inadequate, and it simply makes no sense to go to gym where it is too good.\n5. So, we have to pick from the rest of the choices. B: inside the gym and C: on the gym.\n6. Now, D: gym is the more obvious choice.\n7. We go to the gym to work out, and the gym is a better fit for this purpose than anywhere else. This eliminates option C: on the gymnastics. \n8. So we are left with A, B, and D. \n9. As it always makes sense to do some exercise if bad equipment exists, it has to be one of these three.\n10. We need to find which choice provides the best place to do some exercise.\n11. However, exercise can include many ways to relax or engage in some sports. On the contrary, we go to yoga studios to relax.\n12. This eliminates F: on the Yoga studio.\n13. So, the answer must be B: in the gym.\n14.

{"text": "item that can be placed or hung inside a doorway.\n3. We should also eliminate option B: control panel, as it is an object placed outside and not within the doorway.\n4. Options C: opening door, D: doorknobs and E: doorway are choices that relate to the door directly. It's logical to guess that options C and D, which involve door related objects or actions, would be easier to find among the options.\n5. Doorknobs can be found on the edge of the door frame or on the handle itself. So this choice can be disregarded.\n6. Similarly, with doorways, the object would be contained between the door leaf and the frame. Therefore, we can mark this one out as well.\n7. This leaves us with options C and E: opening door and doorway respectively.\n8. Opening a door is one of the activities we use a door for and this would be contained between the two door leavings. \n9. Therefore, since the object is described as \"contained\" in the question, it is logical to assume that the opening door is the object of the question.\n10. Since opening a door needs some degree of manual intervention, we can eliminate option E: doorway.\n11. So the answer to this question is C: opening door.\nAnswer: C: opening door\n\nInput: Who would make sure that everyone has a plate of food?

A cooking appliance would be a general term which applies to many cooking tools that have diverse functions, from grilling and baking, to steaming and boiling.\n4. The oven works on a stove which is a cooking appliance.\n5. The kitchen is the space the food is prepared in.\n6. A cook helps us prepare the food.\n7.

Instead, the action that is being asked is where we would grab an unmoving object contained by a door.\n5. As a consequence, only option A can account for the question. Doorways are places where objects are contained by a door, and thus, the only answer would be to grab them from that doorway. \nAnswer: A: doorway\n\nInput: Where does a dog do its business typically? Choices:  B: on a pothole C: on a bed D: on a bedpost E: on an old blanket\nRationales: First, the question is asking where a dog typically does its business.\n2. The only choice that could be considered in the question would be A: on [ ] its business.\n3. Dogs do typically do their business in places where they can relieve themselves, which brings us to the question of the appropriate choice for this answer.\n4. The dog could do its business on a bed, a bedpost, an old blanket, or a pothole.\n5. \"On a pothole\" is a nonsensical choice and is thus eliminated.\n6. The other three choices are all areas that a dog could use for its business. While couches may also be areas where a dog does its business, the use of the term \"bed\" and \"bedpost\" in the question can be interpreted as referring specifically to areas where a dog can do its business on a piece of bed furniture.\n7.

{"text": "object contained in a room, and thus it is not inside a doorway.\n3. Similarly, we can eliminate option D: doorknobs. \n4. Option B: control panel refers to the mechanism that operates the door, but not the door itself, and thus the doorway to which it refers would be limited to the door itself and would not include an object inside the room beyond the door.\n5. Option E: doorway refers to the doorway itself and not the contents of the doorway.\n6. Therefore we are left with options C: opening doors or C: doorjambs.\n7. From these options, opening doors is a generic term for the act of opening a door, and thus it would not specify the part of the door through which we would grab it.\n8. Doorjambs, on the other hand, are the horizontal structural members that support the door and frame it, which implies that there could be more than one part of the doorjamb from which an object could be grabbed.\n9. Therefore the correct answer is that we would grab the object from the doorjamb.\nAnswer : C: doorjamb\n\nInput: If I have a plastic cup, and you have a paper cup, what will you need to help you fill up your paper cup?

In a situation like this, they would need to gather some tools or supplies that can help fill the cup.\n3. Knives, straws, and liquid are usually assumed to fit this description of items that would assist with filling a cup, hence these have been chosen as possible answers.\n4. Looking closely at the answers, option A: knife, is unlikely. This would be more relevant if the paper cup doesn't have any sort of opening or spout for filling.\n5. Likewise, option B: plastic strow, would be the same. \n6. Moving on with option C", "answer": " 32"}

Looking at the choices that were not available, we know that the woman didn't find parking lot, or road, as they are not in a store.\n2. Therefore, she didn't find store either.\n3. The remaining options are: candy and park. \n4. We also know she couldn't find candy because she didn't find it in a store.\n5. This means the woman couldn't find park in a store.\n6. This rules out choice C: Road. Similarly, choice D: Store was also eliminated, as she didn't find a store.\n7. We need to focus on the remaining option E: candy. \n8.

Choices:  Hear a cry A: scent B: touch C: taste D: see\nRationales: This question is about finding a verb or adjective to complete each of the sentences, given a person can hear a cry and one can tell. \n\n1. The answer for the first sense that the verbs \"can\" indicate is that we can tell (or sense) someone by looking at them. \n2. We can sense the flavor of food with our tongue. \n3. Then using only the verbs, \"hear a cry\", one can tell by smelling, and \"hear a cry\" tells us that we have sensed something, then a person can tell if they hear a cry in the room.\n4. Since both \"hear a cry,\" and \"tell,\" refer to the ability to sense something, we only need to find the sense that the verbs in the remaining choices refer to: touch, taste, and smell.\n5.

Choices:  M: over the trees A: into the trees B: between the trees C: into the forest\nRationales: The question is asking where a man would go if he walked through a forest. \n1. First, since the man's path in the forest is unspecified, he could have walked through either side (through the trees or between the trees).\n2. The possible destinations for such a path are the 'forest' or 'outside of the forest'.\n3. We can eliminate option A: into the trees since, as the forest is between the man and his destination (the outside of the forest), he would not end up inside the trees, but rather on the other side of them.\n4. As for the options B and C, the forest may appear to be like a sea of trees, but in reality the forest has gaps between the trees.\n5. So, the phrase \"between the trees\" suggests that the man went through a gap in the forest. This indicates that he would have to end up on the other side of the forest.\n6.

It asks: Where is a better a better place to buy something if you're on a tight budget?\n3. To know where a better place is, we need to know what is better.\n4. We can first determine whether it's something that is cheaper or something that is of better quality.\n5. Based on these criteria, we can determine that the question is asking us to determine which a better option is with respect to price, based on their availability in different stores.\n6. Looking at the given choices,\n7. choice 1: A: home store: this is an option that includes options for buying different items for your home, including furniture. \n8.

Looking into the answer options, option D: doorknobs would be the one that contains the object as the object is attached to the doorknob/latch.\n5. Since the options are either the door, which would have only a doorframe, or doorknob, the answer would have to be a door that contains the object.

Although it is technically possible to grab an object from a doorway in or around this type of device, it doesn't seem to be what the question is asking about.\n5. Therefore we can assume that the object in question will be one that is typical to a setting that contains doorways, such as an opening door.\n6. Now, the options C: opening door and D: door knob make sense in that context. So we can rule out option B: control panel since it doesn't fit with the context of a doorway.\n7.

There are several different types of stores, such as grocery stores, clothing stores, hardware stores, and more. Therefore, \"man getting to the store\" could refer to a trip to any of these types of stores.\n2. Some stores sell only certain products or ranges of products. For example, grocery stores typically sell food while clothing stores sold clothing.\n3. However, grocery stores often sell a range of different food products such as fruits/vegetables, meats, dairy (milk, cheese, etc.), and non-perishables (cereals, dry goods, granola bars, snack foods, etc.).\n4.

Similarly, we can eliminate option C: opening doors as they are not a contained object. \n4. Option D: doorknobs seem to be an object that is contained, but not really contained by a doorway, since doorknobs are attached to the door itself rather than to a doorway.\n5. This leaves us with option E: doorway, which seems to be the only choice that could refer to a doorway's location as it contains the phrase \"contained by a doorway\". \n6. This suggests that the object contained by a door is a contained object itself. So we can eliminate option B: control panel.\n7. Hence, we can now identify doorway as the answer.\nAnswer: B.

It is asking for an example of an action that is not hard to do.\n2. However, these examples are too specific or too generic.\n3. For example, swimming and running are physical activities that are not inherently hard to do.\n4. However, these are not activities that are not hard to do in context.\n5. For instance, swimming and running take coordination and practice to improve and get better at. This makes it a bit hard to get good at these activities compared to other activities that would not require any practice on your part.\n6. Besides, eating and drinking involve certain preparation and technique (e.g. how to prepare food, chew, and swallow), which will be hard to perform if you have not encountered them before.\n7. Hence we can eliminate options A: swim, B: run, C: drink.\n8. Like eating and drinking, falling over is not hard to do in isolation, but it becomes hard to do in context, so it gets eliminated.\n9.

Considering the given choices, only D: doorknobs are actually limited to the area that they \"contain,\" which is a doorway. Doorknobs contain something (doors) and they can be grabbed to hold a door open.\n6. Option E: doorway can function as a choice but does not provide a description of a particular part around a door.\n7. Since the choice B: control panel is invalid, we can't choose it for any of the rationales, and can also rule out Choice C: opening doors, because it does not match any of the conditions.\n8.

Choices:  A. farmer's market B. grocery store C. backyard D. convenience store\nRationales: A farmer's market is typically a public marketplace where local farmers and other producers sell their products directly to consumers. It is a good source of fresh and locally sourced produce because the farmers are in direct contact with their customers and can answer any questions about the produce. \n\nAnother option suggested is a grocery store, but this choice does not provide the same level of freshness as a farmer's market.\n\nThe backyard option is a good place to grow small quantities of produce such as herbs, but it would not be an efficient way to access large quantities of fresh produce. \n\nThe convenience store option is a good source for getting packaged snacks but not a good source of fresh produce.

Looking at the choice list, we can eliminate yellow lab, as the given question refers to a movie and the yellow lab is a breed in real life.\n3.

If we go through the remaining options we can find two choices- C: gold lab, and D: chihuahau, which sound somewhat similar to real-life breeds but have strange-sounding names.\n5. They both have strange names, which indicates that they are exotic breeds. This can also be observed from how the choice is written.

Option B: control panel can also be eliminated for similar reasons.\n5. Options C: opening doors & D: doorknobs are not relevant as the question is asking us to choose a place that an object could be 'contained by the frame of a doorway'.\n6. So, our answer is E: doorway.\n7. Doorways are places that objects contained by the doorway could be'moved' i.e. they are likely to be grabbed from.\n8. Doorways can also be 'contained by' the object that is contained by the doorway. Since the object is contained by the frame of the door, when we are 'inside' the doorway (i.e. inside the frame), the frame too counts as the object which is contained by the door, which is also grabbed and moved.\n9.

The given options are the TV, a table, a couch, a window, a chair, and \"a TV\".\n2. We're looking for the option that directly answers the question and isn't the TV itself.\n3. Thus, the two \"wrong\" options of a TV and \"a TV\" are immediately eliminated, leaving us with choices B: couch, D: chair, and E: television.\n4. Now, we need to determine which one of these answers our question directly. We can eliminate C: table because it is also an object.  \n5. Moving on to options D: chair and E: television, the only difference I know about TVs and chairs is that I can be behind or next to a TV, but not a chair. \n6.

Looking further at the remaining options, it can be found that B: control panel, D: doorknobe and E: doorway all refer to specific objects contained by a doorway, which is a possible solution to the question.\n6. Option B: control panel is an object typically used in a door for control or access, but not relevant to the question as it refers to the door itself and not the \"object\" contained in the doorway.\n7. Option D: doorknub has a higher probability as doorknobs are typically found attached to doors, and so it is an object contained by the door, which is relevant to the question.\n8.

The 'doorway' likely forms a space that an object could be contained in, hence, the available options are E: doorway and D: doorknobs.\n6. In an effort to answer the part of the question where we would grab the object, we need to know the specific location of the object in relation to the doorway. \n7.

It is unlikely that we would actually grab the door itself, as we can easily pass through it during use and it would require special effort to grasp it.\n5.

There are three possible reasons why this is the case:\n    * B: \"It holds money\" does not make sense. We do not hold money for business operations as we can't easily access it or count it.\n    * C: \"A cash register allows transactions (of money) to be recorded\" is a possible option, but is still too vague. This only tells us that it has something to do with recording, not that it keeps a business running.\n    * D: \"A cash Register provides security for both patons and owners\" is good because it states that a cash register protects both customers and business owners.

To use the options correctly, we need to know what subtraction, addition, and multiplication, and division mean.\nWe can quickly eliminate A and B, since C and E show that we need to replace a symbol with a symbol from the same group, so we can't use a + to replace a +.\nTherefore, we must check D and F, which both indicate that we cannot replace a symbol from one group with a symbol from another group. \nF also shows that A is correct, while d shows that B", "answer": " 45"}

The sentence in question is asking about a teacher's plan, what the plan was and then also asking about how the teacher might end up feeling after her plan unfolds.\n2. Since the plan is a 'teacher's plan' its most likely something the teacher is doing or something that the teacher might do, rather than being something that is happening to another person.\n3. From there, we need to understand how to correctly answer the second part question: if her plan fails in some way.\n4. She is most likely concerned the plan will be unsuccessful. After all, she doesn't want the plan to fail, but we still need to think how a plan can fail.\n5. There are two basic ways a plan can fail:\n6. A plan can fail literally if it doesn't work. For example, a plan to bring a chocolate cream pie to school for the entire student body that inadvertently fails to reach the teacher's desk and is simply stolen by some student.\n7. But a more likely scenario is that the plan can fail figuratively if the plan has the goal of making the teacher feel comfortable or satisfied in some way.\n8. To achieve this goal the plan would most likely be the teacher's class assignment given to the students. But in order to achieve the goal of making the student comfortable, the plan would need to be successful. That means the plan can fail figurartly if it isn\u2019t successful", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": "object, but it does not appear in a doorway. \n3. Then, B: control panel does not appear under a doorway, so we can eliminate this as well.\n4. Option C: opening doors does not suggest an object within a doorway, hence we can eliminate it too.\n5. Option D: doorknobs are not objects, so we can eliminate it as well.\n6. For option E, it would say 'of where we are standing', but our statement is 'where you would grab an object that IS contained by a doorway'. Since we do not stand IN the doorway, we can eliminate this as a valid option.\n7. Finally, there remains only two potential valid options, C: 'opening doors' and E: 'doorway'.\n8. Since option C: 'opening a door' already has an object with the prefix 'in' that indicates it's an internal aspect of the door, we will eliminate option C.\n9. The only remaining option is E: doorway. Since the question is 'Where' and the object is 'contained', we will not say 'the' as 'the doorway' would simply indicate the doorway as a location but not that we are grabbing an object contained in the doorway. \n10.

Option C: opening doors is a plausible choice, however, it would have to be an object that doesn't interfere with opening the doors.\n7.

For options B: control panel and C: opening doors, we can reason that since they are related choices, if one is not possible, so is the other. \n9. Therefore, since it's unlikely we'll be able to open the doors and there would be some hindrance in accessing the TV panel, we can eliminate the two options.\n10.

Doorknob and control panel are both objects that are located outside the house, and do not require a doorway.\n6. So this leaves doorway and doorknob as remaining options.

But the doorknob does not have any features from which to be grabbed while being contained by the doorway, as, in this case, the door itself would be blocking access to the doorknob. \n5.

Among the remaining two options E: doorway and F: door, it is more likely that the doorway contains the object rather than the door itself. The door is not contained to any wall, whereas the doorway typically forms an enclosure. So, the object is more likely placed inside the doorway rather than the door.\n6.

Since a book is a specific thing that we can't generalize to books in general, the phrase actually indicates the need to go to an individual book store\n\n\n2. \"I went to be a pen\"\n    a. The phrase \"went to buy a pen\" is ambiguous, we can't be sure what it means exactly\n\n    b. Assuming it means going to a specific store to buy a pen, it indicates a writing store\n\n3. The key here is that we shouldn't go \"home\" to buy the pen, so our answer won't be home. \n4.

Choices:  \"B\": rain  \"B\": storm \"A\": rain showers \"B\": ice \"C\": rainy season \"B\": hail\" \"B\": snow\nRationales: One might think that rain could cause a ruckus and the same argument could be applied to other weather-related answers like hail and snow. However, this is not what the question suggests.\nA ruckus could also be caused by a group of people protesting together or simply by people partying.\nTherefore, as an option, we can eliminate C: rainy season and D: hail because they describe a weather situation and not a group of people or a party.\nThe same goes for option E: snow, as it only indicates the weather caused by snow and not a party.\n\nWe are left with just two options, A: rain showers and B: storm.\nBoth of these describe a large storm. While a storm could cause a ruckous in a specific neighborhood, if the storm is large, and spread over a large region then, it would not cause a ruckous anywhere. This is the key to the correct answer.\nWe can eliminate A: rain showers as an option as it describes a small storm.\n\nThis leaves the option B: storm.\n\nHence the answer is B: storm.\nAnswer: B.

Option D, the doorknob will be the right answer.\n7. The doorknob is in the doorway and it can be grabbed, since hands fit around it.\n8. Now, the question is: if you had a doorknob, which part of the doorway would be most valuable for you to have?\n9. Option E: 'the doorway' cannot be right. Again, you are only grabbing the door knob.\n10. Option A, 'the television', cannot be right. This is because the question asks where the object is, not where the object is contained. It makes more sense to think about taking the part to the object, not the object itself.\n11. Option B, 'the control panel', cannot be right. It is not contained within the doorway.\n12.

The answer would be found in option C, where you could grab an object from a door knob or doorknob. This is a handle on the door that you can grab to open or pull the door.\n5. Now we can further narrow in on option D: doorknobs, since if you were able to grasp this object, then you can pull the door open. However, this option is also false, as while the doorknob is located at a doorway, it's not necessarily an object contained by a specific doorway. You could also grab this object outside of its door or out of the room where the doorway is located.\n6. So our next choice is option E: doorways. This option suggests that you can grasp an object that is contained within a doorway.\n7.

The phrase \"doorway\" refers to a specific kind of space with a frame and a certain shape that typically leads towards an entrance or exit.\n4. So, whatever you grab from a doorway could be either entering or exiting the space, depending on which doorway you go through.\n5. For example, we could grab something while entering or exiting a house through its front door. In this case, while exiting a house, the doorway could be the outer frame around the door, but while entering, it would be the inner frame around the door.\n6. \"Grab\" here should be understood as \"hold or take hold of\" since it is not the action itself but what you use to hold or take hold of an object.\n7.

It says, \"If I\u2019m looking at ____ then their name would be _____\".\nGiven that \"If I\u2019m...\", we will try and eliminate options that do not involve an IF condition.\nOne way to do that is to ask, \"If we are looking at someone, then their name will be...\", as in the case of \"If you\u2019re looking at it, then \u2018it\u2019 should be...\"\n\nWe will start by eliminating options that describe us being with someone or that do not use the word we.\nLet's eliminate D: beside me. This tells us that we are to look at someone, but doesn't talk about us.\nLet's also eliminate A: behind me. The text says, \"If I'm looking...\" so this eliminates option C: in my hands.\nOption B: in front of us describes the condition, but does not mention anything specific related to the person we are looking at.", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "object contained by a wall, not a doorway.\n3. Then, we can eliminate option E: doorway, as this contains the same object we would be seeking to grab.\n4. Moving on, we find that control panels and doorknobs are both on the door, so these are not an option either.\n5. Looking back at the remaining options, we find that \"opening doors\" requires physical action by the user, opening the door and pushing it or grabbing it. Therefore, it would be the object that is contained by the doorway and can only be grabbed by opening the door physically. However, if there is no opening mechanism, the user will have to manually force the door open with some other object, since opening doors is not an available option at that point.\n6. Also, since the chosen object would be contained by the doorway, it will be behind the door and can only be grappled when the door has been opened or forced open physically. \n7. Therefore, we can safely eliminate option B: control panel.\n8. Finally, \"c\" for doorknob is the only option left. So the answer is that we would usually grab what's contained by a doorway using the doorknob.\nAnswer: C: doorknob\n\nInput: What did a dog eat and need surgery for?

So it would be better to focus on the surgical option, to determine what the dog could have eaten that might require surgery. \n2. Now, we can eliminate all the options that are not objects dogs could eat, except for options F: 6 toys and G: a whole body and toy parts.\n3. Dogs may eat small toys and body parts but not as a single unit. In fact, it's more likely they would consume them piece by piece. So, F and G", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "inanimate object and TVs are typically not contained by a doorway that's held shut.\n3. Likewise, we can eliminate option D: Doorknob, as we'll see next.\n4. The first phrase of the question refers to the doorway as a container, suggesting that the object is contained by the doorway in some way. \n5. Looking at option C: Opening doors, it's possible that a door could be considered closed even if an object was contained between the door and the frame, as the open door would partially block the object. \n6. This suggests that the doorway may be open for a period of time.\n7. Option E: Doorway, is still possible, but would require the door to be closed completely so that we can grab something from beneath it (perhaps the TV?). \n8. As we can see, option C: Opening Doors can be considered again. \n9. But as the object needs to be contained by the doorway, we need to first determine whether a door can be considered completely closed.\n10. If so, we would need to grab it. So, can a door be completely closed?\n11. The terms 'completely' and'shut' are defined. 'Completely' means without leaving any unoccupied space, and'shut' is used to indicate closing the door by putting something on it. \n12. Therefore, if we can interpret the doorway to mean that the door cannot leave any unoccupied space between it and its frame, then we can consider the door completely shut. \n13. Considering that a doorway is made up of a frame, door, and jamb (which can be said to be contained between the door and frame), we can consider the doorway completely shut when the door is closed and the jamb is obstructing the doorway. \n14. Therefore, option B: control panels, can be eliminated. So now we're left with option C: Opening doorknob or option E: Doorway.\n15. Next, we need to determine if we need to consider the doorway to be completely shut for us to grab an object from beneath it and answer the final question of \"where\".\n16.

{"text": "object that would not be contained in a doorway.\n3. Also, we know that option D: doorknobs isn't the answer either as it doesn't specifically refer to an object that's \"contained by a doorway\".\n4. So that leaves us with options B: control panel, C: opening doors, and E: doorway.\n5. If the object is contained by a door, it means that it is being held in place or otherwise contained to some degree by the forces of the door's frame.\n6. The most literal interpretation of the question may be to look at control panels contained in an object that would allow us to access a button or touch-pad that operates the door.\n7. However, the concept of what's \"contained in\" something is usually relative to a certain scope and context.\n8. This means that a control panel on the inside of a refrigerator would be considered contained in that refrigerator, but a control panel in a room would not necessarily be contained in that room, unless it's been specifically built into the structure of that room or otherwise held or confined in some way.\n9. Also, there may not be any particular point in a control panel that we would grab when an object is \"contained\" by a doorway. \n10. The same applies to opening doors - when an object is \"held in place\" by the door, we probably wouldn't want to get into a specific point that's being held, unless the structure of the door is somehow confining us to specific points on either side of it.\n11. If the object is held by the forces of the opening door, then it will likely be contained by the door, but the door itself wouldn't have a particular section or point to grab.\n12. With these issues in mind, the question is likely asking for something that would be more likely to contain an object within the doorway, rather than a door, per se.\n13. That leaves us with the remaining option E: doorway, which would most likely contain an object held by a door.\n14. So, the answer is E: doorway. \nAnswer: E: doorway", "answer": " 80"}

Option c: opening doors is incorrect as well, because an 'opening' cannot be 'contained', unless you mean 'opened' and not 'contained'. So we can eliminate option C.\n4. Option B: control panel.

{"text": "object contained within a room and not a door way.\n3. It is also not clear what the context for this question is. If this were a home or business, we would expect the doorway to be connected to an indoor area (i.e. a room on the same floor).\n4. If indoors, we could reason that \"doorknob\" would not be an option, as there would be no doorknob to grab the object via.\n5. This leaves us with options B: control panel, C: opening doors and E: doorway.\n6. If there is a control panel on a doorway, it would be in the room connected to the doorway. So it's most likely to be indoors.\n7. Therefore, we are more likely to find the object indoors, at least for option B.\n8. When we reason about this, the word \"control\" is implied as most likely to be of digital or electric nature, in which case \"door knob\" is likely to be replaced by \"button\". \"Pressing\" a button to activate or to open a door, would happen in a room indoors, whereas if the door is indoors, it's highly unlikely for someone to open it manually.\n9. Option C: opening doors sounds like a door opening itself by some mechanic way, most likely a door with a motor to open, and not a simple manual turn knob.\n10. So, this leaves us with E: doorway. \n11. As we've reasoned, it's possible to interact with something in a doorway (the knob, button, panel, etc) to activate or operate the door.\n12. We can also say the objects contained within doorway are probably things such as grocery items.\n13. These things are placed in the doorway such that they are easily accessible through the door, making them easier to interact with than in other places in these scenarios.\n14. So, it's reasonable to say we should look for doors within doorways (or maybe outside doorways, but to open a door, we must get inside the doorway first) to find things we could grab.\n15. \"Doorways\", as the name suggests, are used for opening doors (or for other things such as moving between rooms).

The asker can make the sandwich, the one who likes sandwiches, or the one who is offering the sandwich.\n2. The words \"make a sandwich,\" by themselves, do not indicate what the answer is.\n1. \"Who wants a sandwich?\" means different things in different contexts, so the response given should be based on the context.\n2.

So, looking at the question one would immediately go to either option A: cows or B: people. \n4. This is because while the options E: cattle and C: sheep aren't really specific about what they belong to, the terms cow and people are well-defined nouns that are almost universally understood as belonging to a certain category. \n5.

For cows, a herd is a set of cows that follow a dominant or leading bull. \n7. As such, all of the cows in a herd are under the dominance of the single bull. \n8. Therefore, if cows are herded, then by extension, they would need to belong to some kind of larger system, which makes sense if they are all under the control of a single bull.

Choice B: control panel can be eliminated as well, based on the requirements of our movement, since a control panel would only move the object a small distance (for example, from one room to the next).\n6.

Options C and D both make sense as doors are usually used to close and restrict access to things, but we can further eliminate C: opening doors as such doors cannot by their nature be used to access any object inside, since they only serve that purpose.\n5. To help answer the question, we need to look at what objects might be contained by a doorway, such as D: doorknobs. Given options E: doorway, we already know that we're dealing with a doorway.\n6. But we need to remember that a doorway itself does not contain any object on its own, as it would only be an entrance, not an inside space.\n7. So, this leads us to A: doorway.\n8. Given that doorways contain objects, we now know that objects are likely to be contained in doorways, and objects that are contained by doorways are also likely to be contained.\n9. This means that the most likely item to be contained by a doorframe is the door itself, so we can eliminate E: doorway.\n10. Therefore, the answer to this question should be A: doorway.

The question asks about a mixer used by the baker to mix fresh dough.\n2. To start solving this question, we can identify the answer by going through the following steps.\n3. There are a few preliminary steps before this. First, the question is asking about a mixer. In this case, we have a mixer (option F) which mixes dough used to make pizza (option B).\n4. Now, we need to eliminate options A: bread, B-D: dough, and E: pizza, since none of them can be classified as machines. They can be classified as products made with a mixture of the other, but in this case it is a machine that is being mixed in the mixer.\n5.

Hence, we are left with options B: control panel, D: door knob and E: doorway.\n5. The \"control panel\" is the panel of buttons you'd typically find at the front of a door - and it does not contain objects.\n6. Similarly, \"door knob\" refers to an object which you do not grab but rather, hold so as to be able to open and close the door.\n7. Lastly, \"doorway\" is a gap or passageway through which an object can be passed. You could certainly put your hand through a doorway to grab an object on the other side, but this does not satisfy the question as the object was contained by the doorway.\n8. Thus, the answer can be reasonably narrowed down to the remaining options: B: control panel and E: doorway, which in the given choices can be eliminated. \n9.

A ladder isn't exactly a good place to be safe and secure. It doesn't exactly inspire confidence that the person is safe up there. A car or a house would be better options if the person were concerned about the potential to be secure.\n3. A car is a safer place but how secure is it?

We have eliminated two options, narrowing the scope of possible choices.\n4. \"Opening doors,\" however, is also unlikely since this involves actions that are not limited to a place. So we can eliminate option D: doorknobs.\n5. We are then left with three choices: \"doorway,\" \"control panel,\" and \"opening doors.\"\n6. Although this might seem like a logical option, we would never pick up an object such as a door and use it to pick up other objects found within the doorway, as this would defeat the point of a door. This indicates that this is an unlikely choice.\n7. Similarly, option E: doorway is almost certainly not the intended choice. This is more like a general location of a door than an object that contains an object.\n8. However, we have narrowed down the options to two remaining choices: \"control panel\" and \"doorway.\"\n9. The \"control panel,\" however, requires some interaction with the doorway to open, as it would typically be an electronic interface that controls the door's functions.

There is no context given to determine how 'old' the old woman or her dog might be, so this answer could be true or false.\nWe can also eliminate B: young couple and young woman. These answers are both the same.\nFrom this point on let's call B: young couple to be BC: young couple.\nMoving on, we can eliminate the possibilities of C: elderly man because there is no mention of who or what 'his dog' is referring to. If 'his dog' refers to his dog, then this would indicate either that the young woman or the elderly lady's husband or boyfriend would need help getting his dog to a walk. However, there is no description of who or what is in the elderly man's life. We can also use our information gained from B: young couple to eliminate E: elderly lady.

However, this may not always be true. For example, if the store is outside the town limits, or if there are no public transportation services available, or if the person does not have enough time to take two modes of transportation, or other such factors may make it unfeasible for the person to combine these two methods of travel.\n3. In cases where it's not feasible to combine a walk and a train ride, a response that says the person would not walk and take a train is a logical answer because no person would walk or take a train to a store that they can't reach.\n4.

An open field is vast and empty, with no defined boundaries.\n2. To \"let it in\" an open field suggests that the horse would not have the ability to decide whether it enters the field or not, but rather the field would naturally expand and capture the wild horse.\n3. This is consistent with the phrase \"open field\". Although \"field\" usually conveys a bounded area, in this case, it means an open field that is not restricted to a finite domain.\n4. Looking carefully at the options in a list format, it helps us to understand the nature of the choice-giving: \"Would a horse...\" means that there is an object (horse) with specific characteristics. \"Have much fun in...\" means the object's attributes could be applied to the scenario given by the phrase \"let it\".\n5.

Option C: drowning is not usually an action performed by liquid water, since liquid water is typically not 'drowning', so we can eliminate option C: drowning.\n 5. Since options D: floating and C: drowning both describe an action with liquids drowning, which a puddle is not, we know that neither is the action being performed.\n 6. Therefore, the answer to the given question is: E: performing nothing.\nAnswer: E - Performing Nothing\n\nInput: The two people made the decision, they are going to where?

Then we can eliminate option E: doorway, because a doorway contains a door, and this question is asking about what's inside the doorway, not what's in the doorframe itself.\n4. Moving on, option B: control panel, can possibly be ruled out too, because it may exist outside the doorway rather than inside it.\n5. As for options C: opening doors and D: doorknobs, these are likely the only two options that could reasonably contain an object of any type, although this is more likely for C: opening doors.\n6.

So, our answer would be C: opening doors. \nAnswer: C: opening doors\n\nInput: On the other side of the wall, what might they not hear? Choices: A: music B: television C: people shouting D: silence E: someone crying\nRationales:  \nHere, the question asks about what someone on the other side of the walls might not be hearing.\n\n6. The only two options out of the five that have anything to do with sound are choices B: television, and E: someone crying, which we can eliminate from the very beginning.\n\n2. This leaves us with four more options, none of which make any sense in the context of being on the other side of a wall.\n3.

So, if we can eliminate three choices, and can then think of an alternative that works with the structure of the question, then we have a good answer.\n6. Looking at the remaining choices, we can eliminate B: Control panel because it is inside a computer, which is inside a computer room, and it is not contained in a doorway. \n7.

Option A: 'fist\" does not apply here, as we are talking about a bird not a human, and humans use their hands and fingers to peck at items.\n2. Option B: 'Beak' is definitely a correct answer here, as this is the tool that birds use to peck their food.\n3. Option C: 'Tongue', in this context, is completely wrong option, as a bird uses its beak for pecking, and not it's tongue.\n4. Option D: 'Hand' can also be an incorrect one, as a bird does not require a hand to peck at its food.\n5. Option E: 'Foot', is also an incorrect one, as the same goes for birds as it does for humans for pecking food.\n6.", "answer": " 624"}

Choices: A: be quiet E: be loud B: be responsible C: be unsuccessful D: be unreliable\nRationales: The text reads 'An individual...is responsible for giving others permission'. \nSince the question requires choosing a verb, we first need to decide what type of word it is. \nA verb is a word that expresses action, state, or occurrence in a sentence or statement. It can be either an action verb, an intransitive verb, or an auxiliary verb.\nA verb can be a word that describes an action, state (the physical property of the person, idea, or thing described), or occurrence (something that happens at an interval of time).\nIn this context, from the given options, A, C, and E are action verbs. B and D are intransitive verbs.\nFrom the options, only action verbs can fit in this case. \nWhen deciding which option to choose, you should consider who or what the sentence is trying to describe, and what action you can associate with that person or thing.\nOption A - In the given sentence, we can assume that it is the individual, not 'others' who is giving the permission. \nTherefore, the sentence should refer to an action by the individual, not an action by others.\nFrom this case only, A - 'be quiet' fits. \nOption B and E - Here, we again refer to 'be' as the verb.

Although a person can grab objects contained within the doorway, it would not be applicable when talking about an opening door. \n7. Option D: doorknobs could refer to any of door handles, but it is more specific to door handles with knobs. \n8. Therefore, for knob-shaped door handles, we would generally use the doorknob to grab an object. But knob-less door handles that have only a hole in them, would not be included in the term \"doorknob\". \n9.

Option B: control panel is a good candidate as a doorway can potentially provide access to a control panel or other device contained inside the doorway, such as a safe or another cabinet. \n4. Option C: opening doors is a possibility, as the doorway itself can function as an opening for a door and potentially allow for access to objects contained therein.\n5. Option D: doorknobs is very likely to contain items that are contained by the doorway, as someone typically needs to touch the doorknob in order to open or close the door, and thus interact with the objects contained in the doorway.\n6. Option E: doorway functions as a door-way, which obviously contains items when it is not closed. Moreover, it connects two points of a structure, so there is no way that it does not contain items. \n7.

The only remaining options are option C: opening doors and option E: doorways. \n6. Option opening doors refers to the action of opening the door and letting an object out, rather than grabbing something that is contained in the doorway. \n7.

Option C: opening doors can be eliminated as they are just the door itself that can be either opened or closed.\n6. Option D: doorknobs can be eliminated as while they may be used to open doors, they are not the same thing.\n7. Therefore, the remaining options are E: doorways and C: doorknobs. \n8. Looking at the definitions, the doorway is an \"entrance or passage through a building, made by a hinged door, with a frame forming a square or rectangular opening\". [Wikipedia] \n9. The doorknob is a \"handle or knob used for turning a door or door latch, for opening and closing a door and so also allowing someone to enter or leave\".[Wikipedia]\n10. Therefore, 'doorway' refers to the physical entrance to a room/building, and a 'doorknob' is a part of the mechanism that allows you to enter the door frame or latch the door closed.\n11. As such, there seems to be no reason to choose option A: doorway over option D: doorknib. The doorway is not necessarily an area where we would grab an item.\n12. So we can move forward and consider eliminating option E: doorway since it doesn't really answer the prompt properly. \n13. This narrows our choices to B: doorway, and D: doorknub. \n14. Next, we must consider the given context of the prompt. \"Grab an object contained by a Doorway\" implies that we need to get an object from the doorway itself. \n15.

The question asks what would you need to do to see something in a theater in two seconds.\n2.  In movies, action sequences generally use quick cuts of varying frames per second with high contrast.\n3.  Thus, anything you see in such a clip in a movie is a moving image in which the scene is constantly changing.\n4.  However, if we are to be able to see some specific object, we need to be able to recognize it even in case there is no motion in the frame. Therefore, we'd need to recognize it at least once.\n5.  Given the fast cuts, we have only two seconds to identify the object in the scene.\n6.  So, we need to know what the object looks like in that time.\n7.  This requires that we remember the object, so we need to be able read it.\n8.  Thus, we'd need a book with texts (and not illustrations) that would allow us to read what is in the clip.\n9.  Our choices include 'headphones' as wearing them would not make it impossible to read a book in that time.\n10.  So, choice E: Read a book can be eliminated.

A flower bed is a small, enclosed area of land, usually a small rectangular area, that is used especially for planting and growing flowers and plants.\n5.

{"text": "object that's typically not contained in a doorway. \n3. Option B: control panel is a type of electronic control for a door, so it too doesn't answer the question, and can be eliminated. \n4. Option C: opening doors is actually the door itself, so it can be eliminated. This is because opening the door would be an action, rather than the object one would grab, and even though you can grab objects from a doorway, this option doesn't directly answer our question. \n5. Similarly, we can eliminate option D: doorknobs and option E: doorway. Doorknobs are just the knobs on the handles of the door, which are not objects contained by the doorway. Likewise, the choice \"doorway\" means the complete doorway itself, which includes the doors and the door handles. So, the question would be about something within the doorway rather than an aspect of the doorway.\n\n6. Therefore, there are only three choices left: option C: \"open doors\", option B: control panel, and option E: door.\n7. While it seems reasonable to assume that we could grab something from an open doorway, this again is an action and not an object that relates directly to our question.\n8. Option C: \"open doors\" is also eliminated because the question doesn't ask what we should do to open the door, but rather what we should do to grab an object from the doorway.\n9. This leaves only two remaining options - \"control panel\" and \"door\".\n10. The \"control panel\" is not an object that is contained in a doorway, since it is a type of electronic controller for the door rather than a door accessory or contained in the doorway. Thus, it can be eliminated as an answer option.\n11. The phrase \"control panel\" is often used in reference to electronics in general, including equipment like home stereo systems and computers.\n12. Therefore, option E: door is the only appropriate answer.\n13. Since the door is a door accessory contained in the doorway, it's the most natural part of a door to grab. In fact, \"grab\" is a common and basic action often used when referring to doors or their accessories.\n14. In short, the answer is E: door.", "answer": " 32"}

Option C: opening doors doesn't say where we would grab the object inside, it just says the object is contained by a door. \n6. Therefore, we can identify that only option D: doorway is a possible answer, as D: doorway could refer to the location where we would grab an item contained inside a doorway, e.g., grab an item contained inside the doorway from outside the doorway.\n7. However, it's unlikely that the doorway would be that large, and the door or the object in a doorway is more likely to be smaller in size, making it difficult to grab it.\n8.

Therefore we are left with options D: doorknobe and E: doorway. \n6.

For example: \"My doorknob contains my doorway.\" \n8. However, the question indicates that we should be grabbing the object.

Additionally, rules of the game, referees, and other related contextual aspects can vary depending on the league, tournament, or other characteristics of a game.\n5. All of these can be used to describe a soccer (football) game.\n6. However, the given choices are only some of the essential parts and cannot capture the complexity and diversity of soccer altogether.\n7.

{"text": "object that cannot be contained by a doorway since it is too large and heavy.\n3. Similarly, option E: doorway, is a specific opening which cannot be an object itself.\n4. Doorways are usually made to allow a person to move from one room to another, and not normally used by themselves for containing objects.\n5. This eliminates option B: control panel, which is probably the largest and most important component of a doorway, so it should only be used to control or maintain the doorway itself, not for containing other objects.\n6. Similarly, option C: doorknob is not relevant because door knobs are just there to open or close the doorway.\n7. We are not grabbing door knobs for other purposes.\n8. Hence, the final choice is an option that allows the doorway to contain at least one object. Which is option D: doorknobs.\n9.

The question is, does the boy can see the town from the treetops?\n2. Option A: the town, refers to any city that the boy can run from the town. The boy is just running from a particular town or he wants to go from this particular town to a different city.\n3. It might be possible to see the town from the tree, but running from the town to somewhere else would only take him back to the forest/tree. So he would not see the town\n4.

Option D: Doorknob, doorknobs usually do not have grip handles and would only allow you to physically grab the door itself.\n5. Leaving option E: Doorway, the doorway itself may have something like a handle for you to grabb, but in many cases, this handle is simply a place to hold the door when opening it and there wouldn't be a handle to use to actually grab an object contained within.\n6.

{"text": "object contained by a television, not a doorway.\n3. Option B: control panel may represent the objects or devices in the doorway that controls it. But the question is asking about an object, not a device, contained by a doorway, so this can be ruled out as well.\n4. Option C: opening doors refers to the part on the door that a person may grab to open the door. But this would not be correct for the question since we are asked to grab an object, not a handle. Hence, this can be eliminated. \n5. There are a number of different objects that may be contained by doorways. A common example would be a door itself, which would often be closed to prevent entry. So option D: door knob may be the right answer from this list of objects. \n6. However, we can then see that most doorways are designed to permit the use of the whole door, rather than just the door handle. After all, the purpose of a door handle would be to open the door. \n7.

Since he is going there to look for sneakers, sneakers are among the choices in the question.\n2. Choice B refers to underpants. John is not searching for underpants.\n3.

We can remove option B: control panel, since we aren't usually carrying an object up a doorway, and this part of a doorway does not give a good enough handle for objects to be held.\n4. We can also remove option C: opening doors, since we would not look to open a door to pick up something.\n5. Now, we are left with options D: doorknobs, E: doorways.\n6. If we look at option D: doorknobb, it is unlikely. Doorknobs are not typically in a position where they could be used to easily grab an object that is positioned in the doorway.\n7. Option E: doorway does not meet the criteria of the question. Doorways do not contain objects and the sentence says nothing about them. Therefore, this option should also be removed from the pool of choices.\n8. So, the correct answer is left with either A: doorway or B: doorway.\n9. Now, we should examine the two remaining options, taking into consideration which one better describes the scenario.\n10. The choice A: doorway seems to correspond better to the question, as it refers to the entire doorway and everything contained within it.\n11. The choice B: doorway, on the other hand, seems to describe the door's frame, which it is the door itself. For example, a doorknob is only part of the doorframe.\n12.

At this point, the only options left for where we could grab the object are B: open panels, C: open doors, and E: doorways.\n4. Let's take a closer look at B: open panels. This may represent a situation in which one has to open a door in order to grab something on the other side of the doorway. However, opening the door is something that is already provided for us and is not an action we would typically perform while we are grabbing an object.\n5. Similarly, option C: open doors offers this scenario, but we also have the choice to grab the object without opening the door. \n6. Hence, choosing either of the two options mentioned above would be incorrect and they can be discarded.\n7. Only option E: doorway remains.\n8. As an element/part of the door, the doorway represents the area to one's left or right when standing in front of a door.\n9.

There are a variety of emotional responses. \n1. Angry - Angry might describe an emotional response to a disappointing and/or upsetting experience. This could be relevant after a student receives a grade, if the performance is lower than expected. \n2. Happy - Happy would be an appropriate response if a student receives a grade or other academic feedback that they believe indicates success. \n3.

As the given choices are B: decorations, C: light bulbs, D: curtains and E: wallpaper, it is best to start by eliminating the less likely option, as the other options have some bearing on or correlation to a brighter room. A room with decorations becomes more appealing with proper lighting too, and similarly, curtains and wallpaper, when hung correctly, can help enhance the brightness. Therefore, we can eliminate D and E.

Therefore, doorknobs are the answer: options D: doorknobi E: doorways.\nAnswer: D,E: doorknob, doorway\n\nInput: \"I need a place to stay.\" What does \"any place to sleep\" mean to me? Choices:  \"A: underground\" B: without sheets \"C: in any room\" D: in my room \"E: comfortable\"\nRationales: The question is asking about the meaning of the phrase \"any place to sleep\", which can be understood as \"any sleeping arrangement that meets my needs\".\nNow, the various possible answers for the question have been listed, with some of them having multiple options based on different meanings.\n1. A: \"underground\" is an example of an arrangement where the act of sleeping is not a typical activity.\n2. \"no sheets\" is an alternative arrangement where sheets might not be used, but it's not a typical place to sleep.\n3. \"in a room\" refers to the place where sleeping typically occurs, so multiple options (including \"in my room\" and \"in any room\", which are similar in meaning) can be chosen as the correct choice.\n4. \"comfortable\", unlike some of the other options, indicates a place where the act of sleep is intended, suggesting that it is likely to occur on a regular basis and could be considered a typical area for sleeping.\n5. \"My room\"", "answer": " 12"}

Choices: \tA: 32 days B: 7 days C: 44 days D: 81 days E: 48 days\nRationales: First, we need to find the solution to be sure we are solving a whole number problem. \n1. The question is, \"How many days would they need if they exercise 2hrs a day?'. \nWe can use the division symbol to divide 2 to get 1 and then use multiplication on 1 to get 8hrs a day. \n2. The question is, How many minutes does it take for someone do do 8hrs of bouldering?\n1. The first part of the question is how long it would take someone who exercises for 2hrs a in a day to exercise for 8hrs, or 360 mins in a day.\n2. By subtracting 480 mins (which is the number of minutes in a day, 480/60 = 8 hrs in a day) from the total number of mins they should exercise in a day (828 mins - 480 m = 348 mins). So you get 14 minutes per day. \n3. In each day the person will do 14 minutes (of bouldering), it would take 360/14 = 25 days, 6 hours, 40 min or 7hrs 10 min a day.\n4.

{"text": "object that does not fit the requirement of \"being contained by a doorway\", so this does not satisfy the question.\n3. Options B: control panel and C: opening doors can both be opened by grabbing them. But if an object inside a doorway is not moving, then it is not being \"contained\" by the doorway. \n4. Hence, we need to eliminate options B and C because they do not satisfy the requirement of \"containing\" in the prompt.\n5. The phrase \"containing\" generally refers to holding something in place or encasing it.\n6. \"Having\" objects in a doorway may mean that the person wants to keep certain objects in the doorway in case they need them later, or they may also refer to items that are actually placed in the doorway. 7. Therefore, option D: doorknobs is the right answer.\n8. Doorknobs typically have a circular hole in the centre through which the user can pull or push the doors open and shut. 9. So, these \"objects\" are physically 'contained' in a doorway. \n10.

This leaves us with three options: B: control panel, C: opening doors and E: doorway.\n5. Let's start by exploring the choices involving control panel and opening doors.\n6. The control panel option is unlikely to be contained by a door as it's usually located somewhere within a place or area, such as a control panel in the center of a building floor.\n7. Hence, we can exclude option B. Similarly, option E: doorway is unlikely to be used to contain an object since doorways are typically not large enough to hold the kinds of objects that may be required to be grabbed.\n8.

Option C: Opening doors are for opening or closing doors, not for holding an object that's in a doorway, so they should be eliminated. 5. Option D: The \"doorknob\" is a part of a door used to open it, not an object that could contain another object, so it should also be eliminated.\n6. Finally, option E: the \"doorway\" can contain objects, such as the \"doorknob\", so it isn't an obvious choice to eliminate.\n7.

Choices:  A. The phone call was the reason. B. You would need to inquire further. C. The caller would say Hello. D. Their significant other was on the other line. E. They were going to be late for an appointment\nRationales:\n\n1. We can eliminate \"B\", as having someone standing and talking in a room doesn't provide any evidence as to why that person is crying.\n2. There are many things that could cause someone to cry, so the caller on the phone call alone doesn't fully explain why the person is crying. \n3. We can eliminate \"D\" because the caller on the phone is not the person's significant other, which is what would lead to crying.\n4. For \"E\", you could call their significant other on the phone, but there's no guarantee that the other person would pick up.\n5. This would mean they would then be lying on the floor crying, which is not necessarily a result of a phone call, but rather many other things that can cause someone to cry. \n6.

If they are labeled with a fraction like 10/100, then this indicates that these are 10-cent coins. This can help form a mental picture of the value of different coins.  Let's consider the denomination of 10 cent coin. 10 cents is 1/10th of a dollar.

It's asking what noun should be used to substitute the blank place and not the place itself.\n2. Therefore, we need a definition of place.\n3. According to Webster's, places are: 1. A definite position on or location on Earth or another planet or satellite, 2. A region marked off for some purpose, 3. The relative position of a physical object. \n4. Looking at these, we can exclude ceiling, floor, and grass, which are not physical objects that define a location on Earth or any planet.\n5. We can also exclude sand, as it is not a place.\n6.

Given the word \"apartment,\" we will be looking for an answer that corresponds to a domestic, residential setting.\n2. With this in mind, let me clarify that it would not be the \"ground floor\" of an apartment, which is the same as a normal house.\n3. Looking at the choices:\n    1. If a building had multiple floors, there would be several stairways by which one could reach these other floors.\n    2. Also, the doorways to individual units would be inside the stairway, but inside apartments, it would be the other way around, which means that stairways are always inside an apartment but there could be other doors besides stairway doors.\n    3.

School Library D. Gymnasium E. Study Room\nRationales: A. Open Classroom: \nAn open classroom would be better for the student since it fosters better engagement and interactivity between teacher and student. This is advantageous to learning, as it allows the teacher to understand the learning styles and abilities of the students, and provides learning opportunities tailored to their specific needs. In addition, it encourages collaboration and peer-to-peer learning, which can help develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\nB. Closed Classroom: A closed classroom may have more privacy and a sense of formality, but it may also be more restrictive and limit the range of instructional methods. In a closed classroom, the teacher may be more focused on delivering content and lecturing, which may be unengaging for students and not promote critical thinking and problem- solving skills.\nC. School Library: It may also be important to consider the types of materials available in each setting and whether the library setting would allow for access to current and relevant resources.\nD. Gymnasium: However, depending on the type of student activity, having access to sporting facilities is also an advantage as students are able to get physical activity on their breaks.\nE. Study Room: In addition, a study room could be beneficial for students who prefer a more structured learning environment without the distraction of the general classroom setting.\nAnswer: B. Closed Classrooms\n\nInput: Which do you find to be more useful, learning the language in a book or learning the language in a classroom?

Choices:  Monica B. moodle C. mackie D. mccall E. mcpherson\nRationales: First, the question states that the monkey wanted to be in a room. \n1. Looking at the choices and the information given, we can deduce that the room the monkey wanted to go to is the one where the verb 'go' is active.\n2. Since option E is asking if the monkey is in the room, we can eliminate E.\n3. Now there are 4 options: A, B, C and D.\n4. We can eliminate B. This is because, in A, monkeys are known to chatter and chattering would be out of place in the moodle room. Further, we can eliminate monkeys from the moodle room because the question talks about a monkey.\n5. Hence, we can conclude that the monkey is at the mackie room.\nAnswer: D.

If the moon was not in the first sentence then there would be no need to mention it in the rest of the sentences.\n2. Likewise sentence 4 should mention flowers in it.\n3. We cannot say that the narrator smelt the flowers because there are two's's in the word. If we were to get the's's wrong then we would misspelled the word.\n4. Finally we can eliminate C because the narrator is talking about himself and his brother.", "answer": " 100"}

With option B: control panel, we are eliminating an object of a type, because a control panel is an abstract concept of something, like a dial or switch.

Next, we would eliminate option option B: control panel, as we don't really grab control panels to access items inside doorways. They're more for operation, control and regulation.\n4. Moving on to option C: opening doors, it would be weird to say that you are opening doors to access a doorway. Doors are typically used to open (or close) a means of entry to a room or area.\n5. Option D: doorknobs sounds like it might be an acceptable option since it is an item we would grab when accessing an object inside a room. But in this case, we're accessing an object by accessing a door in a frame of the door. So the doorknob isn't the only item that could be accessed. The entire frame, and thus the door would all be accessible.\n6. Therefore we can only eliminate B, C, and D, and the only option we have to choose from is E: doorway.\n7.

Choices:  A) not make sure B) not care C) watch D) think E) make\nRationales: The most important aspect to figure out is what does \"make sure that I was able\" mean and look out for the choice which matches it the most. (A) not make sure (B) not care (C) watch (D) think\n\nA) Not make sure - We know that A is not the right choice and we are done.\nB) Not Care - In this choice, I am doing something which someone is not watching out for. But we know that I would certainly like to do it since I am trying to answer the question. From this we know that C or E is correct, since B states that you would do something which they do not want you to do.\n\nC) Watch - For this choice, there is a chance we could be doing something which someone has to watch, but that someone does not care whether I do it or not.

In general, a doorway is a passageway or opening that allows people to enter or exit a building.\n7. Option E: doorway meets this criteria, so we can eliminate the other options.\n8. Option A: control panel does not necessarily mean that there is a control panel in a doorway. \n9. We can also eliminate option D: doorknob as it is neither a contained nor an object that we would usually grab contained by a doorway, but rather a place to physically open the door.\n10. Option C: opening doors indicates opening a door itself, which is not contained by a doorway at all.\n11. With the remaining options, option E is the most appropriate answer as that doorway acts like a confined space for objects, where we can expect to find objects contained by the doorway itself.\nAnswer: E : doorway\n\nInput: Which of the following things do you often hear in a dentist's office?

Choices:  - A: grilled cheese sandwiches B - C: cheese curdle C - D: pizza D - E: bacon cheeseburgers\nRationales: Answers:\n1. Two cheeses that are both associated with grilled sandwiches are mozzarella and pizza cheese. 2. In a grilled sandwich, the cheese melts and binds with the other ingredients together, which is a characteristic of both mozzarella (cheese curdle) and pizza cheese (a blend of mozzarella). 3. Other types of cheese that are well-known for grilled sandwiches include cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese, and American cheese. 4. However, these types of cheese are usually paired with other ingredients like bacon, tomatoes, or pickles. They will often not appear alone and as a side dish. 5.

Moving to option D: doorknobs, they are definitely part of a doorway and are generally accessible. And if a door knob is in a doorway, then it is contained by it, thus option D fits the description.\n5.

Choices:  A. hungry B. thirsty C. in the wrong cave D. dead E. full of food\nRationales:\n\n1.

It was _____\n\n2. Once we understand this, we can eliminate the choices and arrive at the correct answer.\n\na. Option A: hungry\n\ni. Bats are usually nocturnal animals so they usually forage around at dusk to feed, and then return to their roosting sites by dawn. Thus, it is unlikely that a bat would be flying in a cave during the daytime unless they accidentally flew inside; a bat would have eaten enough to make themselves full during its active period.\n\nii. Moreover, option A could not be hungry as the question asks: \"The bats _____\".\n\nb. Option B: thirsty\n\ni.

We only grab an object that's contained by a doorway when we mean to move the thing.\n6. This means we aren't meant to hold onto the doorway, like how you wouldn't hold onto a window frame. Hence, we can choose option E: doorway and it is the correct answer.\nAnswer:  E: doorway\n\nInput: What animal does what in a field with the letter G? Choices:  G: Goat or a goose B: Goose or a goat\nRationales: First, we need to understand what the question is asking.\n2. The question is looking for an animal that the letters G from the phrase \"What animal does what in a\" can be associated with.\n3. The first thing that we should remember is that the animal should be associated with only one letter from 'What animal does what in' and not both.\n4. Now, when we look at the given choice B, Goose or a go (or Goat or a go), it is clear that it does have both an animal and its associated letter in the choice.\n5. The choice G: Goat or goose (or Goose or a go), which has only one letter from the sentence and an animal to match, is, therefore, clearly the correct answer.\n6. Goats are commonly found in fields, and the letter 'g' can be found in animals and in flocks of geese. So, the answer is A.\nAnswer:  G: Goats\n\nInput: Can you hear the chorus sing?

The question is specifically asking about the shipping pallet after the shipping company makes a deal, which indicates that they have fulfilled a deal, packed, and transported the cargo, so it is unlikely that the pallet would now be in the truck.\n2. Shipyards are also known as \"dockyards\", which makes it impossible to distinguish choice B and E.\n3. It also makes sense that a pallet would not be in a railway car, as it is made of wood and would likely not be able to withstand long-distance travel via rail.\n4.

Looking at choice B, it is the control panel of a car that could potentially be contained by a door. \n5. But while it is an object contained within and accessed from the doorway of a car, it's not specific enough as an answer for our question to identify.\n6. To this end, choice C is the most appropriate as it identifies that it's referring to a door made of two separate doors that are secured together, which could be closed to contain an object.\n7. This means that the door, when closed, could be referred to as \"the doorway.\" Therefore, the answer is E (doorway).\nAnswer: E: doorway\n\nInput: What is the best way to have your cake and eat it too? Choices:  L: pay for it B: borrow it D: use it E: eat it\nRationales: Step 1: Understand the situation.\n\n1. The situation tells us that we are planning to eat some cake, that we like.\n2. And that we want to eat the cake immediately as well as save it for later. In other words, the cake needs to be eaten AND saved.\n\nStep 2: Identify the possible options.\n\n1. It doesn't make sense to pay for the cake so we can eat it or have it saved for later...\n2. It also doesn't make sense for us to borrow the cake because borrowed items don't have to be returned, nor do we have the rights, and don't know how to handle that particular item properly. Therefore, both options (i) pay for it, (ii) and (iii) use it, are eliminated.\n3. Similarly, we shouldn't just eat it then, because we like cake, however, we might want to save it.\n4.

Choices: 1 A: no 2 B: most likely 3 C: often 4 D: probably 5 E: not sure\nRationales:  1. Isolating bacterial cells refers to a process of segregating specific microorganisms from other organisms in an environment to allow them to be grown in culture separately and in greater numbers.\n2. Cells are individual organisms within biological tissues or colonies, whereas plates are containers used to culture the bacterial cells obtained through isolation.\n3. Since bacterial cells are the individual organisms that are being grown and isolated through the plates, the bacterial cells are in fact the smaller entities in the relationship.\n4. Therefore answer 2 B is the most accurate.\n5. Answer 1 A is correct. Bacteria is a class of microorganisms composed of a large and diverse group of single celled, usually rod-shaped microorganism.\n\n    In conclusion, bacterial cells are smaller than bacterial plates because a class of bacterial organism is smaller than the class of bacteria.\n    \n 6: A: NO\n\nInput: How would you expect your skin to look if you got 100% burnt?

If there is a doorway and an object inside, the object won't be contained by the doorway. \n5. With the assumption that the object is contained within the doorway, all the remaining options do not contain the doorway itself.\n6. Doorways are a space where doors open and close, and are not objects in themselves.\n7. A: doorknob does not specify that the object was in the doorway. We also need to be careful to avoid misreading the first option. Doorknobs are part of doors, and it's not a door that's contained within a doorway.\n8. Option B: \"control panel\" can refer to any number of things. Since it's not a part of a door, it's not contained by the doorway either.\n9. Option C: \"opening doors\" refers to the action of opening or closing a door. It's not an object that is contained within a doorway, or even an object that is in the doorway itself. Moreover, the term \"opening doors\" can refer to many things. It's not limited to a doorway. For example, the phrase \"opening a door\" can refer to a person opening/closing the door of a car.\n10. This leaves us with options D: door and E: doorway as the best two choices. Doorways are spaces that can hold doors, but are also objects in their own right.

Therefore the choices we are left with are: option D: doorknobs and option B: Doorways. \n6. Doorknobs are a piece of metal fastened to a door and are generally located on the inside of the door, in the doorway. So, we can eliminate option D: Door Knobs as the only remaining option.\n7.

We are also told that the dog was very eager to eat. \n1. To find the proper word that will replace \"food\" in the question, our first step is to eliminate any options that do not fit our requirements. \n2. Thus, we start by looking at option E: Food, since there is no logical reason for this to be the solution to the question. \n3. Therefore, we will eliminate options E: food.\n4. Next, we start eliminating options that do not relate to the dog's condition. \n5. For instance, the options that are not related are D: bed and B: toys.\n6. Why? Let's use the first option, which is B: toys. If the dog's stomach is ailing, he likely isn't playing with toys, and thus the correct replacement for \"food\" won't be \"toys\". \n7.

Looking at the given list of choices, we need to see which of those is actually a home or building. Options B: kitchen, C: porch and D: garden are locations within homes or buildings. We need to discount other locations, and E: parking lot is not an option. Now, the question states that we'd practice a waterfall-like flow to avoid flooding. So, for the location to be considered, the area's floor should be somewhat like a waterfall. The other elements of a fountain include the fountain and the basin, which should be kept together as a singular fountain and not as separate units, and the basin should be kept outside.

Choices:  C: stomach B: thigh D: heart E: brain F: pocket\nRationales: Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. From the context of the sentence, it is evident that the boy was trying \"so he could win a race\", indicating that the race is an important part of the story.\n2. Additionally, the phrase \"biggest part\" is used to describe a part of the boy's body that can be filled to win the race. \n3. So the question is simply asking for the name of the body part that can be filled to help the boy win the race.\n4. Among the choices E and F, only the body parts that the questions asks about can be considered (these are the \"biggest parts\") as the other choices are not the body parts at all (brain and pocket do not describe the body parts at all).\n5. These are heart and stomach. \n6. Among these two choices, heart is not the part filled up by the boy to help him win the race, as the heart is a soft and internal organ, so there is no way it can be filled up.\n7.

{"text": "object that typically sits outside a doorway.\n3. The terms \"doorway\" and \"opening doors\" are synonyms, so we can eliminate those two options as well.\n4. Option C: control panel, means the panel near the door that controls the door or its related equipment.\n5. As you normally enter through a door (when it is not broken), you would be passing the control panel, not directly in front of it.\n6. The answer is not necessarily the door, although if there is only a small object/person in the door, it may be physically possible to grab them from the door.\n7. Therefore, the answer to the entire question is option E: doorway.\nAnswer: E.

Choices:  A. that you will need to see me again B: that you will need to call another doctor C: that you will not need to be seen again D: that you will have had a procedure done E: that you will have a surgery\nRationales: The context requires that the patient have visited a doctor in the past. As a result of that visit, the doctor will tell the patient one of the following: 1. That he or she will need to see the doctor in five years. This is the only option that implies an unscheduled return of the patient.\n2. He or she will have to schedule an appointment in another practice.\n3. He or she will not need to see the doctor. Choice E only applies if the patient has a surgery performed. Thus, it's not applicable.\n4. He or she will need to schedule the procedure.\n5. If the doctor was sure of what the outcome for the patient will be (and it is not just another diagnostic), then he or she would have already performed the procedure. Choice D implies that the doctor performed a previously scheduled procedure.\n6. The only choice left is B because that is how the doctor knows that he or she will need the patient to come back.\nAnswer: B. that you will need me to see you again\n\nInput: The students were all very interested in what the speaker was about to say.

{"text": "object contained within a cabinet or a case, not a doorway.\n3. Option B: \"control panel\" doesn't quite match the structure of the sentence since it would be a panel contained by the doorway instead of an object.\n4. So, we can eliminate option A: control panel.\n5. Continuing with our reasoning, option C: 'opening doors' doesn't make much sense because this can't be a general type of object.\n6. Likewise, option D: 'doorknob' can't be correct since it doesn't refer to any kind of 'contained' objects.\n7. Hence, we can now eliminate option C: doorknob.\n8. Next, we come to option E: 'doorway', which seems to be a common sense answer, but let's examine what it exactly means.\n9. Since a doorway is, as the name suggests, a passageway that's created by a door, it would typically contain (that is, lie adjacent to or be close to) the door instead of the entire room or structure itself.\n10. So, the logical answer would be to choose option A instead of option E: 'dooray'.\nAnswer: A: doorway.\n\nInput: John wanted to play a game, what did his father call John for?

{"text": "unrelated object.\n3. Option B: control panel could be selected, but this refers to the door of the room or building, but the question refers to an item that is in a room or building, not the room or building itself.\n4. From here, we can eliminate option C: opening doors because this doesn't relate to the object, but rather the doorway itself.\n5. Option D: doorknobs makes sense to eliminate next, as a doorknob is the hardware that opens a door, not necessarily what is contained by the doorway.\n6. We can now choose between options E: doorway and B: control panel.\n7. If we look at what a doorway contains, we notice that often it contains a door itself. So, option E: doorway could be selected. \n8. Looking at the control panel, the other option, we see that it refers to the controls of a door, not the door itself. So, this makes this the correct answer.\nAnswer: B. Door control panel\n\nInput: What do you have to do to have more than two children? Choices: A. Add a sibling B. Stop having children C. Get married D. Marry two women or men E. Have twins\nRationales: For option C, the answer is clearly \"Stop having children\" but I just want to add a little bit more to it. Option C states that \"you would have to stop having children\", but you cannot \"stop\" having children; you can just decide to not to have any more. (Unless that is your decision). So while that might be a little pedantic, I find it's important to be able to pick out the nuanced differences in word choices. \nAlso, at the beginning of the response, I provided a simple explanation of the answer choice for option B: \"Do you need a sibling to have more than two kids? Well, no. If we are taking the question literally, the answer is simple. Having more than two children simply requires that you have more than two children.\"\nAnswer: C. Stop having children\n\nInput: Where does someone use a vowel when they sing? Choices: 1. A. In the song. 2. B. On the lyrics. 3. C. In the song.4. D. Nearby. 5. E. In the", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "object that would be contained but not found near the doorway.\n3. Next, we can eliminate option C: opening doors, as an opening of a door would not contain an object. \n4. Option D: doorknobs cannot contain objects, as a doorknob's purpose is to open a door. \n5. Option E: doorway can be eliminated because when an object is contained by a door, its placement can't be in a doorway. \n6. Therefore, B: control panel is the best option out of the given answers.\nAnswer: B : control panel\n\nInput: If you get caught speeding when you are operating ______ machinery, can you get in trouble? Choices:  C: heavy machinery D: large machine E: motor vehicle F: a vehicle G: mechanical devices\nRationales:\n\n1. First, we need to interpret the sentence. The question asks if we can get into trouble for violating the speed limit while operating heavy machinery.\n2. Now, a possible way to interpret this sentence would be to consider it as an indirect question, in which the sentence would not specify whether the person is operating the heavy machinery or merely caught speeding. In such a case, we can eliminate all the options except D. However, this interpretation appears slightly unlikely.\n3. Another way to interpret the sentence is as a direct question in which the question specifically asks if you're operating heavy machinery when you speed. To interpret this in this way, we need to determine what the author understands as a heavy machine.\n4. So we eliminate F: a vehicle as it is not heavy.\n5. G: mechanical devices can't be the right option either, as the question specifically refers to heavy machinery, which aren't necessarily included in mechanical devices.\n6. C: heavy machinetyis not the right choice as it does not refer to the person's role while speeding. \n7. Option B: large machine can be eliminated as it is not heavy machinery by definition, so it is not specifically referred to here. So, the answer is D: large machine.\nAnswer: D :large machine\n\nInput: He tried to find a house to rent, he didn't want to get a house, and didn't pay the rent, nor the house.", "answer": " 95"}
{"text": "object contained by a room or a cabinet, not a doorway.\n3. Moving on, we also need to know that a doorway's typical opening is vertical. This means it has a single door located either in the wall or on the floor. This makes it a doorway and not a door. \n4. So, option B: control panel should be eliminated. \n5. Options C: opening doors and D: doorknobs make sense but both can refer to a door or a doorway. Let's narrow it down by assuming there is only one doorway and see how this fits in with the rest.\n6. If there is only one door, options A, B, and D would still be available as this leaves enough space for a person to grab anything from the doorway since they are all standing outside the door, not inside.\n7. If there are two doors, which would happen if there are two doorways, options B and C would also need to be considered because a person can stand either side of the doorway. So if the door is positioned centrally in a doorway, both options are still valid, unlike options A, D, and E. \n8. If there are multiple doorways, we can rule out B, D, and E as they refer to an object or an action happening to a door and a doorway can hold just one door. \n9. So, we can conclude that there is only a single door in the doorway and we can eliminate options C and E. \n10. Finally, option A refers to our object that we need to grab, which leaves option B: doorway, meaning that \"where to grab an object contained by doorway\" is \"inside the doorway\". \n11. For example, if there was a doorway between two rooms and something was in the doorway, an option we could take is to reach with our hand inside the doorway to grab whatever is inside.\nAnswer: B:\"inside the doorway\"\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following math question.", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": "object found indoors, not outdoors.\n3. Looking at the other options, we can eliminate options C and D: \"opening doors\" and \"doorknob\".\n4. Our task of grabbing an object contained by a particular doorway does not specify we need to grab the door itself, its handle, the part that opens the door or its latch.\n5. Since openings of a door often extend beyond the opening and into its enclosed space, when we grab something from the door's opening we are technically not contained by the doorway, nor by the door itself. Rather, we can choose to grab anything found within the space enclosed by the door, which extends beyond its opening.\n6. It's also worth noting that grab is a dynamic verb, which means it can be used to grab things that are not still moving. So, grabbing a door in an object contained by a location does not just mean you grab the door in its present state. \n7. The options left from the remaining options are: B: control panel, D: doors and E: doorway.\n8. While doors in a room typically include a door panel, a control panel is more specific and refers to a part of a door that controls the door's motion or opening and closing features. It is the device that controls the door, not an actual door.\n9. Another important difference to note is if you grab the control panel, you would not be grabbing the door itself.\n10. In contrast, if we grab the doorway from the options, the door itself is contained by the doorway.\n11. From this, we know that we need to pick the option that refers to an enclosed space in a building.\n12. This leaves us with E: doorway, which is the correct answer.\n\nInput: In the book, The Wizarding World, what is the location of the Great Hogwarts Hall? Choices: \n A: basement  B: Great hall  C: Great Hall  D: ground floor  E: upper floor\n Rationales: This question asks us about the location of the Great Hall in the book, The Wizaring World. It specifically asks us to pick Great Hogwarts Hall, which means we will need to identify where in the Hogwarts building (that is referred to as Hogwarts", "answer": " 600"}
{"text": "object that doesn't appear to be contained by any doorway.\n3. Next, looking at the other given options, we can see that three of them are already present inside the doorway, and this is true of options B, C, D, E as these contain the words \"door\" or \"doorway\". \n4. \"Control panel\" is a generic term that refers to the physical layout of a device, and doesn't contain the word door or doorway. \n5. Therefore, options B, C, or D are the only choice that could be considered, and we should use some process of elimination to eliminate the wrong options.\n6. Looking at these three options, we'll start by looking at option C: \"opening doors\". This refers to opening the door itself but it doesn't involve grasping any object. \n7. So, we will eliminate C because it doesn't refer to any object.\n8. Next, looking at \"control panel\", we can see that this relates to the position within a device that controls either the usage, access or functions.\n9. This could cause confusion with the term \"control panel\" in a door, which refers to the set of mechanical or electronic devices that enable the opening and closing of the door.\n10. Therefore, because it could refer to any position within a device, option C is too general to be considered an answer, so we can eliminate this option.\n11. Moving on to option D, a doorknob, we can eliminate this too. This is because the question does not mention any restriction or condition, and a doorknob is an option for reaching an object in any scenario, not just limited to a doorway or containing the object. \n12. Therefore, because of its lack of restriction or conditionality, option D can be eliminated. \n13. The other choice, option A: television, is also not correct and would need to be eliminated because \"television\" is not an object that can be contained by a doorway, or even inside a door.\n14. So, the choice left to us is option B: \"control panel\".

Control can also refer to having overall insight, power,", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "object that is typically located elsewhere.\n3. Choice B: \"control panel,\" can generally be found in places such as hospitals, where we could actually access items by grabbing the \"control panel.\"\n4. We can also eliminate option C: \"opening doors,\" which would be performed by someone else if you were to grab an object from a doorway.\n5. By eliminating these choices, we are left with options D and E, \"door\" and \"doorway.\"\n6. Option D: \"door,\" refers to a specific instance of a door, such as a wooden door, a glass door, or a sliding glass door, while \"doorway\" simply refers to the general area or opening.\n7. We can therefore eliminate choice option D.\n8 The only other choice left is option E: \"doorway\", which refers to the general area of a doorway, where an object could be contained.\n9. Therefore the answer is E: doorway. \n\nAnswer: E: doorway\n\nInput: To whom did the cat yowl at? Choices: 1. A: its owner 2. B: the kids in the backyard 3. C: its siblings 4. D: the police 5. E: a rival cat\nRationales: Step 1: The question asks to whom the cat yowled at, which means to which people or objects the cat made a loud sound. Step 2: Option A: its owner indicates that the cat made a loud noise at its owner. Option B: the kids can refer to either the children in the neighbourhood or the child in the household. Option C: refers to the cat\u2019s siblings. Option D: the police are authorities who people call in case of any emergency. So, option D can refer to the cat making a loud noise at any people as part of an emergency (e.g. during a fire or a rescue operation) but we cannot be sure whether it refers to the police or any other authorities. We can further eliminate the option because the yowling that the cat makes is directed at another cat. Option E: a rival cat refers to cats other than its siblings or the owners' pet. So, option E is the correct answer.\nAnswer: C: its siblings\n\nInput: What is the name of the plant where it grew? Cho", "answer": " 16"}
{"text": "inanimate object that isn't contained by anything.\n3. Option B: control panel, is likely to contain some button or switch, however, would not typically be an object that we would grab to walk through a doorway.\n4. With option C: opening doors, this refers to a particular situation where a person is opening the doors to a structure or room, indicating that it is not the object, but rather the manoeuvre that we need to focus on.\n5. Now, looking at option D: doorknobs, this would make sense as we would usually grab a doorknob to walk through a door, as such action would result in moving out of the doorway.\n6. Moreover, doors are typically made of rectangular frames, meaning there is a boundary as to the object that you can place on the doorway.\n7. With this in mind, and the given choices, it seems like D: door would be the best option.\n8. The remaining options are either incorrect or they are similar to what has already been given so.\n9. Doorknob is a good choice since it makes sense that people would grasp it when walking through a door.\n10. With this answer, the choice would be B: control panel.\nAnswer: B (control panel and doorknob)\n\nInput: With the exception of the book, what other objects is this photograph?

Opening doors is not a single object per se and is also not defined in the context. \n6. Therefore, we can't choose option B. However, looking at the remaining two options, we can eliminate option C: opening door. Doorways are typically rectangular, while opening doors may have any type of shape or direction.\n7. We can't eliminate option D: doorknobs in the same way as opening doors. They aren't typically defined in a doorway, and instead, we can assume multiple doorknobs would be present in every doorway or we'd be able to find one inside a doorway.\n8. The question is asking about a single object in a doorway, so eliminating doorknobs is unnecessary.\n9. The only remaining option is the correct one, which is E: doorway.\n10.

Looking at the choices available, option A says the desert is too windy for Christmas.\n4. Yet, while wind may be an issue at certain times of the year, it is not an attribute of Christmas.\n5. So, this option can be eliminated. The same applies to option B which says the desert is too cold. Though it may be cold in the desert, it does not make it an unsuitable choice for spending Christmas. \n6. Since options A and B are negative attributes for the desert, we may find a positive attribute in an environment different to Christmas by eliminating A and B.\n7.

So, for the purpose of this question, \"putting something aside\" refers to a specific action that is taken when we want to put something aside.\n3. As a result, the correct answer option would be the one that describes this action.\n4. Thus, we will ignore words like \"keeping\", \"putting in a place\", etc., as they describe the object's location rather than the act of setting something aside directly.\n5. Out of the given options, only options A: \"place\" and B: \"put\", can match the action of \"putting aside\" directly, and hence are the only options worth considering for the rest of this question.\n6. This action can be explained as \"placing\" or \"putting\" something aside, though the latter option sounds simpler and easier to understand, so it has higher chances of fitting in the context.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is B: \"put\".\n\nAnswer: B: \"put\"\n\nInput: What can you give to a waitress and a cashier?

Doorknobs aren't necessarily enclosed by doorways, unless they are a kind of key pad or lock.\n4. Option E: doorways are not the kind of objects we need, since an object in doorway is usually contained in a door.\n5. Among the remaining choices, B (control panel) and C (opening doors) both refer to mechanisms that could be contained by doorways, so we can eliminate B: control panel.\n6. Door openings, however, are not objects that could be contained by doors, hence option C: opening doors can be eliminated too.\n7. This leaves C: opening doors and doorway as possible answers for the question, as both could be objects contained by a doorway, and none of them can be ruled out.\n8. However, doorways include doors, and we do not need to grab a door as an object. So, C: doorway can be eliminated as well.\n9. Now, we are left with doorway and opening doors, which are still not clearly distinct, as both could imply the same solution. \n10. However, option B: control panel is a clearer match, since it is a unique object that is not contained by a door, but would not otherwise match the characteristics of doorway and opening doors. \n11.

Choices:  - A: library B: shop C: home D: public E: store\nRationales: - Intermediate Reasoning Step:\n\n1. In order to understand, we have to ask ourselves some questions first. The book which is not for sale, where should we keep it? How do we know it isn't for sale?\n2. It should be under our control.\n3. It should be under the user's control, not the book's control nor the store's control.\n4. We also know it is one that is not for sale. So, the question is what exactly is it for?\n5. The book could be for study, recreation, or many other reasons.\n6. Among the given options, Home, a place where people live, is not the most applicable answer.\n7. However, if the book is under our control, the answer would remain under our control as long as we had the book in home.\n8. Thus, Option B: shop could be the answer.\n9. A shop could be a store where we could keep a book.\n10. A library is a place where books could not be kept.\n11. Public is a place where books belong.\n12. Option C: home, is still not the answer.\n13. However, there are things that belong to us, like some of the options in D: store, could not belong to us at home.\n14. A shop could also be a place where books belong, as we are the custodian of the book, but not a place that books could not be kept by us.\n15. Option D: public, though in some cases, books", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": "inanimate object, not an object contained by a (human-made) doorway. \n3. Option B: doorway doesn't make sense as the answer since doorways are the structures that contain other objects. They don't contain anything themselves.\n4. Similarly, option C: control panel is not suitable as the answer since it's too specific and can't be an object contained by a general doorway.\n5. Further, the given options D: doorknobs and E: doorway still do not provide context about which of these would be an object contained by the doorway. \n6. So now, we need to eliminate option D: doorknop, since all doorknobs are used for opening doors and none of them are objects contained within a doorway. \n7. Therefore, option E: doorway needs to be the answer since it is the only remaining option that could be an object contained by \"a doorway\".\nAnswer: E: doorway.\n\nInput: An orange that is not eating is not a human right?

Option C: opening doors wouldn't be a place where we would grab objects but a place where we would open a door.\n5. Therefore: looking at the choices remaining that can be a place where we might grab objects, we can eliminate: D: doorknobe; because a doorknob would not be a place where we can grab something.\n6. Then, we can eliminate E: doorway. The question doesn't ask where we \"might\" grab an object \"located\" in or behind a \"doorway\". The choice \"behind\" a doorway indicates that there should be a real object in or behind a door, not just a hypothetical object.\n7. Thus, the only one of these left to eliminate now is C: control panel. \n8. It's a place where we could possibly grab objects but not specifically or explicitly in or behind the doorway.\n9.

Likewise, we realize that neither doorknob or the doorway by themselves are sufficient to fulfill the requirement that the object contained by or at a doorway, such that it would enable an individual to grab it via a doorway.\n6.

Among these, the term \"doorway\" refers to the space between two doors, which is where the door handle is located. Thus, option D: doorknobb, which indicates the physical element, not the opening itself, is the only option that makes sense.\n7. We know that the door handle typically contains a doorknob because we often use a doorknob to open a door.

At a zoo, a large group of animals is usually kept inside a cage. There are no large animals in a large groups on the road of a zoo. We can assume a big group of animals and a zoo go hand to hand here.\n2. In the wild we can see animals in a large group. So answer B would be In the Forests.\n3. In A safari park they keep many of the animals in a large group inside a cage and on the road. So safari wouldn't do.\n4. In a zoo they keep a few animals in a large groups inside a cage.

Now let's look at options D-E. What does it mean for an object to be \"contained\"? Well, we can assume it means that there's something keeping it securely in one place.\n5. So for the object to be moved or carried with us, it must be able to be removed from that secure location.\n6. If it's \"contained\" by a doorway, then we must determine how many doors are a closed location.\n7. There are three types of doors - open, open doorway, and closed doorway.\n8. An open doorway is the location between two doors.\n9. So, to be contained by a doorway an object would need to be in such a location.\n10. This also suggests that objects being contained by a doorway are also doors.\n11. Therefore, options D-E are not appropriate options since no one would grab a door.\n12.

Now, taking a closer look at the remaining options, they are: control panel, door, opening doors, doorknob, doorway.\n4. Option B: control panel refers to a physical control system that typically serves a purpose for the door, but it would not be used directly to open it.\n5. Hence we can eliminate option B: control panel.\n6. Moving to option C: opening doors, it's unlikely to find a door that is opening (i.e. already open to the outside) as a doorway.\n7. Also, we can eliminate option D: doorknobs.\n8. In addition, option E: doorways (which can also be referred to as 'doorframes') is unlikely as well.\n9. Since options B, C, and E were all eliminated, it can be concluded that the correct answer is A: television.\n10. The choice that refers to an object that could be contained behind a doorway is A: television (i.e. it is possible to have a TV enclosed behind an opening that can only be accessed via a door). \n11.

Choices:  B: sandwiches C: soups D: cookies E: cakes\nRationales: The question asks for A: what did a baker make for a customer.\n1. Looking at the choices first, only B: sandwiches is appropriate, as it refers more to a prepared food and not necessarily a final product.\n2. As a result, we can eliminate the options D: cookies and E: cakes.\n3. This narrows it down to A: sandwiches and B sandwiches.\n4. We can now exclude option B: sandwiches as well, since a sandwich is not the same as a prepared food.\n5. Choice A: sandwiches therefore remains the only valid option.\nAnswer: A or B: sandwiches", "answer": " 8"}
{"text": "object but not a noun. Therefore, let's not consider it.\n3. Moving on to \"Control panel,\" as an open-door device, this wouldn't usually contain any objects. It could contain control buttons or something, but this requires a person to operate the control panel and open the door to get the object. \n4. Next comes option D: doorknobs, doorknobs are used to pull open doors. We understand there is an object inside the doorway, but we can't pull the door open to try to get to it until the door is closed, for the safety and convenience of the door, itself.\n5. Moving on from the remaining four options, looking at the word-origin of \"doorway\", it is defined as \"the space between two doors open at the same end\". \n6. Clearly, the answer lies somewhere between the two doors. So, the question is essentially asking \"between which two open doorways would you get to the object if an object is inside the doorway?\"\n7. We are not given an answer for this question. There's one between doors A and B, C and D and E and F, but only the last-door pairs are open. \n8.

We are asked to pick the one that is not used to mark math. 6. While math uses and is even named after the letters 'pi', 'p', 'i', we can't conclude the triangle symbol is used to mark math.\n7. Square does not mark math, as square is a geometric shape and not a mathematical value. \n8. Similarly, 2 is also not a marked-to-math object. \n9. Therefore, triangles, the shape, is the only marked-to-math choice and is the answer.\nAnswer: 1\n\nInput: If i were", "answer": " 26"}

Here, the question is about which option(s) a person is choosing.\nRationale #1: \n\nFor this answer choice #1, what would the author would be creating? A book? Why? \nThere isn't enough info to say. \nRationale #2:\nLet's say they were writing a book. Now, this is one thing the author is creating. Where did this idea come from? We don't know what the author would be doing in this case.\nRationale #3:\nSo that only leaves option #4: A book.\n\nInput: When someone is driving in a car and they get into trouble, whose fault is it and how would they avoid? Choices: 1: the driver's fault, avoid 2: the passenger's fault, avoid\nRationales: The question clearly asks us to identify the situation wherein a driver is in trouble and to choose the best course of action or strategy that will avoid the problem.\n\nLooking at the response choices:\n\n 1. 'In trouble' is an indication of a negative situation.\n 2. 'Avoid' is a solution to the problem.\n\nSince 'avoid' is a solution and not a problem, then this strategy is only relevant when the problem isn't 'in trouble'.\n\nBased on these conditions, choice #2 seems to be the most appropriate option, or perhaps #4, as it is not explicitly stated that 'the passenger' is the one 'who gets into trouble'. Hence, a possible response is 'passenger's fault", "answer": " 60"}

Choices:  a. a doorway b. a box c. a pencil d. a table e. a sink\nRationales: This problem contains a few misleading words that will confuse students who aren't careful enough with their understanding. Let\u2019s examine the key terms individually.\n\n1. The key word here is the preposition \"with\". Students may answer a, b, or c because they understand these objects as containers. But they all have different meanings, which must be clearly understood in order to solve this problem.\n2. There are 2 meanings of \"with\" in the English language. The first meaning is \"to contain\". Thus, b, d, and e qualify as the answer because they are all containers. This meaning is clear to any native speaker. The second meaning of \"with\" is \"to move along the lines indicated by\" or \"to be with\" used in the sense of \"involved with something\". This is the most confusing part of this problem. For instance, in this case, students may understand the question as asking \"which object is able to contain something?\" They may think answers a, b, or e are correct because they are containers, but those answers are not what the question is asking. The second meaning of the word \"with\" refers to the verb \"to contain\". However, in this context, the meaning of \"with\" refers to a noun as an object which is contained. To avoid confusion, we should read the entire question to understand what it is asking, for example, \u201cwhich of the following is included by the doorway?\u201d\n3. So far, students may answer as a. a doorway is included by a door", "answer": " 240"}

The question also asks where we would grab the object, suggesting that it is a physical object and not some concept or idea contained by the doorway, which makes it clear that the object is located outside of the doorway.\n4. We also eliminate option E: doorway, as it would be incorrect to grab anything contained in the doorway, as that would be incorrect for both meaning and grammar.\n5. Option C: opening doors gives us the correct answer that the item is contained within the doorway, so we can choose this option.\nAnswer: C: opening doors\n\nInput: When might a person put their hand in warm water? Choices:  D: during summer S: after winter E: after winter D: during summer T: never E: never W: before spring R: during a rainstorm S: before spring\nRationales:\nIntermediate Reasoning Steeps:\n\n1. Let\u2019s examine the words used in the question and see if any of them can give hints as to how we can answer the question.\n2. Option A: The word \u201crain\u201d in the question implies the presence of water, which means it rains or it doesn't rain and both those answers to our question are unacceptable.\n3. Option B: The word \u201cspring\u201d in the question implies that the answer is likely to be something that happens in the spring season, which is not true of warm water in general, making this an invalid clue.\n4. Option C: We want to assume that when a person puts their hand in warm water, it\u2019s because they feel comfortable and are enjoying themselves at that particular time. This would be similar to choosing to relax when there is warm sunlight that makes the weather comfortable. The weather only gets cold in the winter and it\u2019s too hot during the summer so that doesn\u2019t leave us with anything left to pick from.\n5. So, we should pick option E: after winter as option D: during summer also doesn\u2019t fit since it\u2019s hot in the summer.\nAnswer: E) after winter\n\nInput: Which of the four options is the largest?

Let say that we made a mistake of saying that we like something but we really hate that thing or someone. \n2. We can choose \n3. \"you really hate that thing or people\" and it's right!\n4. But, if we made mistake of \n5. \"you really hate X and X\",\n6. it would be wrong!\n7. That is the difference of \"you really hate\" and \"you really hate that something or someone\" \n8. As you can see in the choice there are two different words such as person and something.\n9. Person means that it's a single entity and \"someone\" means a plural entity not single!\n10. What would we hate here? Person or something(a single item)? \n11. Person doesn't have only one meaning. \n12. Person can have different meanings like we use it in name people person.\n13. So, here it's \"Person\" which means \"Some entity\".\n14. So, here we choose the second choice \"you really hate X\" where X is a plural item and we hate what we like.\n15. We choose the answer \"you really hate X\".\n\nAnswer: B: you really hate X\n\nInput: What", "answer": " 50"}

Option D: doorknobs is incorrect as it does not provide a place to contain the object.\n5. Option E: doorway is incorrect since we are looking for a place to contain an object and a doorway would not be considered to contain an object.\n6.

What must she be?\nRationales:\n1. The question is about a person who woke up from a short nap, opened her eyes wide and started talking to the kids in the house.\n2. The question asks what she must be, based on the behaviors described above.\n3. Firstly, she cannot be A: sleeping since she's already awake from her short nap and is fully rested.\n4. Secondly, she cannot be B: awake, D: sad or F: sick since those emotions would not be revealed based on the behaviors we know. \n5. So, A: happy and B: excited are irrelevant and can be eliminated. \n6. Thus, she must either be C: awakened or E: awake. \n7.

They are likely to drink the beverage.\n2. They are likely to enjoy it.\n3. They may be willing to consume it despite it containing alcohol. \n4. They will likely prefer the taste over that of no alcohol or another ingredient.\n5. Now, looking at the choices, only candidates D and E match at least two of these criteria.\n6.

The sentence includes the use of two pronouns: \"he\" and \"it\".\n4. The pronoun \"he\" clearly refers to the speaker, the narrator. It's implied that in some way, this is the narrator speaking to us.\n5. The pronoun \"it\" doesn't refer to any specific item.\n6. The phrase \"it\" refers to a pair of thick sox a man is putting on for camping.\n7. The other phrases in the sentence, the pair, thick socks, and campng are not meant to refer to specific items.\n8.

Option E: doors may be held by some people for a split second in order to open or close the door, but this is not a common action or a way to get to the object.\n8.

So the answer is E: doorway. \nAnswer: E: doorway\n\nInput: The person walked to the building, and was inside for a long time. What did the person do? Choices:  (1) walk (2) run (3) stand (4) sit (5) hide (6) read\nRationales:  1. The given phrasing implies that the person walked to the building and stayed inside for a long time thereafter.\n2. The phrasing also suggests that walking, or possibly an ongoing walking action (e.g., a continuous walk versus a single trip there), was sufficient to meet the person's needs.\n3. Therefore the activity, \"walk\" is likely a key component of the person's actions.\n4. The remaining choices are: \"run,\" \"hide,\" \"sit,\" and \"read.\"\n5. The option \"run\" does not seem a sensible choice as it would likely trigger a question about what the person ran to, or the circumstances of the run and so on. \n6. Similarly, the activity \"hide\" does not seem to fit since there are more descriptive phrases that could be used, e.g., a \"scared\" person hiding, a \"hunted\" person hiding, etc.\n7. The option \"sit\" is unlikely because all we know is there was", "answer": " 12"}

Option E: doorway itself is something that is contained or contained by the doorway. It can also be an object. \n6. However, we are only being asked where we can grab or retrieve an object. \n7. Therefore, we have to eliminate option E: doorway, which means that we will only consider choices B and C.\n8. Now, choice C: opening doors, doesn't seem to fit either. Although it is contained or held within a doorway, when we open it, the doors are opened outward to allow the passage to freedom. \n9. Thus, we need to leave this choice and consider choice B: control panel. \n10. Because control panels are typically found where doors open, it can be retrieved by grabbing or grasping the handle of the door. \n  11. Further, if the control panel needs to function or be retrieved, then it must be retrieved as a control panel and thus, we cannot ignore it simply because it can be retrieved freely. Hence, the final answer is B: control panel.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: The boy found his ball behind the dump at the park. Where could the mother look for it with the boy? Choices:  B: ballfield  C: baseball diamond  D: soccer field  E: sports arena\nRationales:\n\n1. For the mother to help the boy recover his ball at the park, she has to first be at the park.\n2. There are two possible locations for this ball. Either they were playing in the park before the boy loses his ball, or they were not and the ball was accidentally kicked or bumped behind or into the dump.\n3. When the boy is on the ballfield, he would usually be playing some of the two games mentioned here, like baseball or soccer.\n4. Therefore the right answer has to do with one of the two games. \n5.

Doorknobs typically are used to open a door, which indicates the doorknob is outside the doorway, contrary to the conditions given.\n6. Looking at options B: opening doors and E: doorway, we find that both these options are related to the opening and closing of doors, and we can infer that they are part of a doorway, so option E: doorway would be our choice.\n7.

The control panel of a door is typically a small device mounted on the door, not a large object capable of being picked up. \n4. Option C: opening doors is too generic. When we open doors, we aren't typically directly grabbing objects they contain. It's more likely after opening a door, we would walk in and pick up the object contained in the door.\n5. Door handle option D: doorknobs can be eliminated. Even if they were large enough, a doorknob is not contained within the doorway. It's the door itself that is contained within the door frame.\n6. This leaves us with doorway option E or opening doors option C: opening doors. \n7. It would make sense picking up an object from the doorway rather than grabbing it off the floor, but this is still an inefficient option in comparison to just simply picking it up from the door. \n8. We can conclude that this is an oath response rather than a true one, however, so the question can be answered by option C: opening doors, since this response is not grammatically incorrect.\n9. Therefore the answer is opening doors option C: open doors.\nAnswer: C: opening doors\n\nInput: When someone is walking they tend to where? Choices: A: a shade B: a brim C: a hat D: a headband E: a beret\nRationales: First, we need to consider what a person is typically doing while walking.\n2. It wouldn't make sense for someone to wear a brim while walking unless they had an on-going movement that required them to constantly push their brim to the left or right.\n3. Likewise, a person wouldn't typically wear a headband except during physical exercise.\n4. This reduces our options to A, B, and E.\n5. Since A: a shade does not fit what we're looking for, it can be eliminated. The question asks for a wearable hat accessory, not a hat that simply blocks or allows the wearer's face to be shaded.\n6.

We can also eliminate option E: doorway, since a doorway contains a door, and a door would not be considered contained by what is held inside the doorway.\n4. This leaves us with the task of distinguishing between the other three choices. \n5. Option B: control panel, is an item that might theoretically be contained in a doorway, but generally it would not be held inside the doorway, but rather outside.\n6. Similarly, option D: doorknobs, would probably be found on the outside of the door, as they would serve to open the door, which is what our task states.\n7. This leaves us with Option C: \"opening doors\", which is the only other choice relevant to our task of grabbing an object that is contained within a doorway.\n8. Option C corresponds with the task of opening a door, which involves holding the handle (the doorknob) and then rotating or pushing down on it. This action would bring our hand close to the door (which is contained by the doorway), and thus would allow us to grab an object that is within the doorway.\n9.

The information contained in this statement allows us to construct a 30-30-90 triangle as shown in the image (where the angle with respect to the living room is the 30 degrees southwest angle).\n2. Therefore, the angle to the right of the 30 degrees angle will have a degree value of 330 degrees.\n3. To get to this angle, we first subtract 240 from 30, which returns a value of 50 degrees. If we rotate our triangle clockwise from this point, the next value that we will obtain will be 90 degrees. Finally, we rotate our triangle clock-wise from this point to get to an angle of", "answer": " 25"}

Thus, \"where would you grab an object that is in a doorway...\" suggests that the question does not require us to actually grab an object but to identify where such an object is. \n6. The choice E: doorway is an appropriate option for this purpose, as it is one point on the doorway-object graph that contains exactly the kind of object that we would be asked to identify.\n7. Therefore, the answer to the presented question is E: doorway.\nAnswer: E. Doorway \n\nInput: The person in the room could hear the mouse rustle in the corner, its movement created what sound? Choices:  Tape A: noise B: rustle C: footsteps D: squeak E: creak\nRationales: The question refers to a mouse in a room. There are various things that contribute to the mouse's movement through the room - for instance, it could scurry toward its source of food.\n\n1. The mouse could also make a variety of sounds as it moves through the room, such as scurrying, jumping, or even squeaking. \n2. However, we can eliminate options A: noise and C: footsteps, which are things a mouse does, but sounds it would only make if another part of its body is moving. This doesn't apply in the case of the entire body of the mouse moving around. \n3. There are options which the mouse could actually make - D: squeak and E: creak - but these are sounds it typically makes to communicate with other mice, which may not be present in the given scenario.\n4. Therefore we select option B: rustle, which indicates a sound the mouse could make when moving through the room.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is B: rustle.\nAnswer: B.", "answer": " 32000"}

Also, the door is not in a way contained, it's there for passage.\n4. Out of the remaining options, we're looking for the location of something contained that we can pick up.\n5. Therefore we can cross out both B: control panel and C: 'opening doors'.  Option D: \"doorknob\" does not indicate a contained something that we can pick up, so we're left with option E: Doorway.  Option E is the only choice that matches the given scenario.\nAnswer: E : Doorway\n\nInput: What did the old man drink in the library? Choices: . A: espresso B: milk C: water D: tea E: hot chocolate\nRationales: First, the key idea to note is that the old man is drinking his drink \"in the library\".  So, we can assume that this is the library where he is drinking.  If it was a library where he was thinking about drinking or if he was thinking about it in another library, then he would not simply be drinking the drink \"in the library\", he would drink there or think of drinking drinks from another library and not necessarily inside of the given library. \n2. In the given options, the only ones that are not a solid beverage and can be considered \"library-like\" are water and tea. \n3. Options A: espresso and B: milk are solid beverages. \n4. Options C: Water and D: Tea are \"library-like\" and could be drinks served in libraries. \n5. The choice of hot chocolate is out of the question, as the person described as an old man drinking a drink in a library would almost certainly not be drinking hot chocolate.\n\nAnswer: D: Tea\nAnswer: D: tea", "answer": " 25"}

Choices:  P: a chisel Q: force R: a knife S: a corkscrew T: pry bar U: hammer\nRationales: The riddle is testing us on our understanding of the task and the steps involved in solving the problem.\n1. Start by eliminating the options that do not answer what. This leaves seven options.\n2. Among the seven options, none of them provide a sufficient answer to the problem of uncorking a difficult-to-open bottle.\n3. This indicates that the answer lies within this group of seven options.\n4. Among the seven options that provide an answer to the riddle, it is evident that the answer will be one that suggests using an object to uncork the bottle.\n5. This eliminates options P: a chisell and U: hammer from the list of seven options.\n6. It also indicates the answer will be an object that is more likely to have an applicable use in opening bottles.\n7. Option T: pry bar qualifies after being eliminated for being an object not suitable for prying or using on bottles. Similarly, option S: a corkscrew is eliminated for the same reason.\n8. Option R: a knife could conceivably have an applicable use in uncorking a bottle but it can also be used to cut or stab, so we can eliminate it.\n9. Option Q: force is also eliminated for being too general or abstract an answer for what is needed to uncork a difficult-to-cork bottle.\n10. Option U: hammer could have an occas", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": "object that hangs on the wall rather than something that would be contained by a doorway (it is in a room, not in a door).\n3. We can also eliminate option B: control panel, since the control panel is an item that is found inside an automobile. Automobiles are not \"contained\" by doorways themselves, but rather they are parked inside a car garage which would be considered a doorway.\n4. This leaves us with the remaining four options. Moving on to option C: opening doors, it is true that doorways typically have door panels that can be opened. However, the wording implies that this door would be closed most of the time.\n5. Therefore it would not be considered a \"doorway\" as the meaning of doorway includes having a door open all the time.\n6. Option D: doorknobs has some relevance because a doorknob can typically be found on a closed door. \n7. However, the question says that an object would be contained by the doorway. A doorknob is an object that is not contained within the doorway itself but rather it is attached to the door.\n8. Therefore it is not a choice that would be \"contained\" by a doorway. If anything, it would be an object that is attached to a doorway.\n9. The other option that remains is E: doorway. When a door is closed and contained within a doorway, it is contained by the closed doorway. \n10. Therefore, this is the best choice.

We'll first rule out option D: door knob because as the question asks for something that is contained, we can't pick it up from a door knob.\n7. Let's look at option B: control panel. Control panels are used for some electronic gadgets or devices like microwave, television and computer to get to the inside. \n8.

Choices: A: light sensitivity B: color vision C: three oval shapes D: a fovea E: the pupil\nRationales: As the statement talks about the human eye, the choice must belong to it and none of the above choices are related to the human eye. \nTherefore, we can eliminate them. \nTherefore we are left with A: light sensitivity and B: color vision. It can be understood that color vision comes under light sensitivity as the eye senses both light and color, but not the other option. \nHowever, it has been found that the eye not only senses color vision but also color blindness (a problem in color vision in which it is difficult to distinguish certain shades of color). \nTherefore, the correct choice is B: color vision.\nAnswer: B - Color vision\n\nInput: A: The man was in a car driving on the highway.

Option C: opening doors could be contained by the doorway depending on where exactly the object is.\n5. The object could be on or inside the door. Alternatively, there could be an opening in the doorway through which the object might be contained by the door. \n6. But this is an ambiguous case. There isn't sufficient information here to say for sure whether the opening in the doorway is enough to constitute the object being contained by the door.\n7. Option D: doorknobs are inside the doorway. This is precisely where we would 'grab' the object.\n8. Option E: doorways aren't contained by the object in the doorway.\n9.

Choices:  I: add vegetable I.e. peppers, carrots, olives II: add potatoes IIII: add onions V: add mushrooms III: add garlic V: add chili IV: add meat IIIV: add bacon\nRationales: First, we need to identify the purpose of the phrase \"to help make a pizza delectable\" because this is the key factor to deciding on the ideal answer choice.\n\n1. The phrase \"to help make delectable\" implies that any additional ingredient does not substantially influence the delicacy of the pizza, but plays a supplementary role to add a little more deliciousness. \n2. Therefore, the choice that provides the most delicious effect when added to the existing pizza while not drastically changing the flavor is the \"best\" answer.\n\n3. We can now eliminate choices II: add potatoes because it adds a relatively subtle flavor with no change in the texture of the pizza. The flavor would simply mix with the other existing ingredients.\n\n4. Choices IV: add meat doesn't really add any additional deliciousness over the existing ingredients. The flav", "answer": " 20"}

No, it's an electronic panel that controls devices, but not a part of a door.\n4. Now we come to option C: opening doors. Well, an opening door is not contained, it's actually the other way around, an object can be contained by an opening door but an opening door won't be contained by an object.\n5. Likewise, option D: doorknobs, has no relevance since we know that 'knob' is just another word for 'door handle'. Hence, we're just trying to find a door handle.\n6. Finally, option E: doorway, is a very literal interpretation of the question. All other objects can be contained; what about a doorway? That's exactly what it asks us about.\n7. The other choices are irrelevant to the question. So, the correct answer is E: doorway.\nAnswer: E, doorway\n\nInput: In which store that specializes in clothes would you need to buy school clothing? Choices: \nA: sports B: fashion C: school E: uniform D: boutique F: store\nRationales: The question is asking in which store that specializes exclusively in clothes would you need for buying school clothes. Since the given options are: A: sports, B: fashion, C: school, D: boutique, and E: uniform, we need to figure out which one out of these options specializes exclusively in school clothing\n1. Now, we know that the phrase,'school clothes' indicates a dress code worn by a school's community, be it a school for kids, students, or a business school. So, now we need to choose an option that indicates a store that caters to people with a specific dress code.\n2. The first option, A: sports, caters to sports-related clothing. It does not signify a specialized store dedicated to school clothing. Therefore, the answer choice is eliminated.\n3. The option B: fashion, focuses more on fashionable apparel as opposed to formal attire, in which specialization is required in school clothing. It still does not mean specialization is needed for the school clothing option but it is leaning that", "answer": " 50"}

Option C: control panels refers to the control panels found on elevators or doors.\n4.

This leaves us with options B: control panel, E: doorway, and E: doorway. \n6. \"Control panel\" could be considered analogous to E: doorway since it is a thing inside a doorway, and the question only asks where we can grab objects, not control panels.\n7. However, \"Control panel\" is still a thing, not a location.\n8. Therefore we can remove control panel as well as doorway since it is not only a thing but it is not necessarily contained by a door either.\n9. Consequently, there is no option that can be eliminated, leaving us with E: doorknob.\n10. Option E: doorway has been eliminated thus doorknob is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B. doorknob\n\nInput: A couch is bigger than a bed by what?

Option D: doorknobs are an appropriate choice for this question. But, we know that the question specifically asks where you would grab an object that's CONTAINED by a doorway.

The question is about when a person changes from one space to another.\n2. You don\u2019t leave a space and then enter one. Instead, you leave a space and then go into another space.\n3. Option A: leaving an apartment doesn\u2019t make sense. Although someone is leaving one space and entering another when they leave an apartment by leaving one apartment and entering another apartment.\n4. Option B: walking outside doesn\u2019t make sense either. If you walk outside then you are outside. You don\u2019t make a space.\n5.

Even if there were some doors, they could be inside the doorway itself, preventing a person from reaching inside.\n5. Next, we eliminate options D: doorknobs, because although they might be used to grasp the item, their use is more oriented towards the door itself.\n6.

B: room\nRationales:\n\n1. As per the given choices the question asks whether the doorway is a room, or an entrance to another room.\n2. Now let's break down the two options:\n3. 1. A: Doorway:\n4.   A doorway is an opening in a wall separating two spaces or rooms. It is a way of making a connection between two rooms. For example, a doorway connects a living room to a kitchen.\n5.   An entrance is an opening into an interior space, typically a room or hallway. Entrances can be found in doorways or door-shaped openings. For example, the entrances of an office or classroom.\n6.   There is no difference between entrance and doorway. But in the given given choices, doorway refers to an opening while entrance refers to an entrance in relation to rooms which means that entrance and doorway are the same.\n\n7.

Similarly, option B: 'control panel' (which is a device to control operations of a machine) does not fall into the category of an object contained by a 'doorknob'. \n4. Looking at option C, we can eliminate option D: door since door is itself not an object contained by a doorknob. \n5. 'Opening doors' can still indicate operations of a door, or the action of opening a door. However, it does not directly refer to 'contents' contained in a door. Hence, we can rule out option C: opening doors.\n6. Now, option E: doorway indicates an opening that is a passage through a surface. \n7. In this case, the opening occurs through a door. \n8. Since the object to be found is supposed to be contained in a door, a person would not grab an 'opening through a door' but actually use this opening to fetch an 'object contained within a door'.\n9. Therefore, we need to find an option that relates only to 'contents', not to an 'opening through an object'. Option D: doorknob is an interesting choice among the available options. \n10. A door knob is a round device that is used to control the opening and closing of a door. It can be used to grab an object by turning it (option D).\n11. Moreover, according to Merriam Webster, a door handle is a lever on a door that is used to open or close the door.

So it is important to understand this concept of standing far away and why that person is standing this way.\n3. It might be the case they are standing because they are far away and therefore cannot stand any closer since they are far away from others.\n4. But standing far away from someone could be a problem because their body is so far away from their feet that standing this way could be a problematic situation. \n5.

Choices:  B: on my phone C: in my backpack D: on paper E: in a coffee shop\nRationales: Question Rationale: 1. The only place where one can use the pen is at a place where it is feasible to have access to a suitable amount of paper to write on.\n\n2. The options provide the most relevant information.\n\n3. Option A and Option B are irrelevant because both of them do not provide paper, and Option E provides a place where no paper is needed.\n\n4. Option D is neither possible nor desirable, so it can be removed.\n\n5. Thus, option C is the most relevant one because it gives access to paper to write on. Options B and E only provide a means of pen use while not providing paper and option D does not allow to use the pen at all.\n\nAnswer: C: in my back pack\n\nInput: At what place does the sun come out when the clouds are in his way from my point of view?

Besides, option B itself refers to the object that controls or operates something, not the object that is itself contained.\n5. Option D: doorknobs can be grabbed and have a smaller range than the doorway itself.\n6. Therefore options D, B, E and C are not appropriate choices.\n7.

Choices: \n\n  * A: fast B: funky C: classical D: opera \n  * E: pop\n\nRationales: We know the type of activity, i.e. baking. We also know what the food is, i.e. cookies. Above all, we do not know, what is the music to make?\n\nThe above information is sufficient to formulate a theory that should be checked by comparing it with a solution.\n\nWe need to find the music type that is opposite to pop. Opera has been picked out, because opera music is supposed to be slow and very serious (unlike pop).\n\nAnswer: Option E: opera\n\nInput: What do the letters S.O.S stand for? Choices: (A) Search Over Stuff (B) Search Outside Shop (C) Search Of Surfing (D) Save Our Shelter (E) Save Our Sea Ship\nRationales: Since the question is asking about SOS, we are first looking for the meaning of SOS. We find that the letters \"S.O.S.\" stand for \"Save Our Ship\".\n\nNow to find answers to the questions, we need to find options that have the same meaning as SOS. In order to do this, we find ways to transform each letter. We find that they can each have the following options attached to it:\n\n\"Search\" -> (A) Search, (B) Outside, (C) Of Shop, or (D) Sea Ship \n\n\"Over\" -> (A) Stuff, (B) Shop, (C) Shore, or (D) Ship\n\n\"Stuff\" -> (", "answer": " 3"}

Additionally, opening a doorway would have to be done before grabbing an object.\n4. We can eliminate options D: doorknobs, as they help us open the door, not contain it.\n5. This leaves options B and E: control panel and doorway. In a typical doorway, these two options represent different objects. Option E: doorway is more common and the other object in this doorway would be the door itself.\n6. Therefore we can assume that an object would be grabbed in that same doorway. Option B: control panel suggests it would be an object behind the door, like the doorbell. This makes sense, and it's therefore the only choice that matches the question.\nAnswer: B : Control panel\n\nInput: In what type of structure does lighting and temperature typically change between parts of the day? Choices: \n A: house B: cabin C: condo D: building E: building A\nRationales:\n1. We need to distinguish between a house, a cabin, a condo, and a building.\n2. Options A: house and D: building are different from the others in that they refer to structures that typically have a specific owner.\n3. We are looking for the structure that a group of people might use and share, such as a condo or a cabin.\n4. Option B: cabin and E: building indicate non-residential structures.\n5. The question states that a home might have different kinds of lighting and temperature, which suggests that the house could include different areas that have different lighting and temperature, and that the user might change these during their stays.\n6. Therefore the only option that could apply is option C: condo. \n7. A condo is a type of shared accommodation (shared space) that typically includes multiple rooms and is a type of residence that is commonly found in the US where the question refers to.\n8. However we can't rule out option A: house which could also relate to how people have their living spaces and lighting in a house changed, with the user typically having control over the lighting and temperature in the house.\n9.

Choices: A: to be a part B: to be a part of it C: not to join D: to join E: not to be involved\nRationales: In this scenario, it's clear that a person is being awarded a badge and the police are trying to convince them to join an organization.\n6. As a result, the right choice to fill in the blank must be one that indicates that the person is accepting the offer to join the organization.\n7. However, it can't be B and C: both A and B refer to situations where the police ask the person to be a part of something. Similarly, referring to D and E: both could be used in terms of the person being asked not to be involved with something, either actively or passively.\n8. The remaining options can be eliminated based on this reasoning.\n9. Therefore the correct answer must be to be a part, which indicates the person's intention to join the organization.

Given this interpretation of the phrase, we can eliminate the choices that refer to other colors than green.\n10. The choices that don't directly refer to green as a color can also be eliminated.

Since this is a control panel for a large device, it's likely this object is not stuck in the doorway or can't be stuck in the doorway.\n4. Eliminating option C: opening doors is just stating that this is an object with a door that opens.\n5. Eliminating option D: doorknobs has only two reasons. First, the doorknob is a part of the door and thus, if grabbed, it would be grabbed by hand, not directly by a hand with the doorknob touching the object.\n6. The second reason is the question specifically mentions that the object is \"contained\" by the doorway. This can't mean that it's inside of the door, due to the second sentence that talks about how this object can't be stuck.\n7. So, if someone grabbed this object \"contained\" by a doorway, their hand would touch the \"object contained\" and not the \"doorway\" like in option D.\n8 9. Therefore, the answer has to be E: doorway.\nAnswer: E (a): doorway\n\nInput: Where do people put stamps? Choices: 1. A: box 2. B: envelope 3. C: cabinet 4. D: fridge 5.

In fact, people tend to store and keep stamps safely in one of these stamp collectors, due to the value of stamps.\n2.

If we look at the remaining options, \"grab an object contained by a [door]way\" means we are grabbing an object contained within the entryway or the structure of the door (A, B, C, D, and E). \n5. Looking at all the options, we can see that options \"opening doors\" and \"doorknob\" do not contain the object we are grabbing. \n6. There are two objects that we can grab from within a doorway, either the object contained by a doorknob or the interior of a doorway. \n7. It's true that opening the door might help us get the object easier since we can view the room without opening the doors. \n8. However \"opening doors\" does not directly refer to the act of grabbing the object, which explains the elimination of option B: opening doors. \n9. Similarly, there is nothing in the phrase \"doorway\" that points towards the door itself or the doorknob. \n10. Therefore, we can eliminate option C: doorway. \n11. Of the remaining options, \"doorknob,\" while referring to 'the doorknob' and not being contained within the doorway does not mean the 'doorknob' that is contained within the doorway. \n\nTherefore, the only option that describes a thing that is contained within the structure of the door and does indicate that grabbing that object is part of the answer is E: doorway.\n \nThe answer to the question is E: doorway\n\nInput: For a man to be qualified for an exam, what did he need to have?

Open doorways would indicate a scenario where something is placed in front of a door, such as a table or a desk.\n5. There are many types of objects that someone could put in front of a door to open it.\n6. But the key word here is 'grab' i.e. we are looking to physically take this object that is placed in front of the door to open it. \n7. This suggests that we would be able to move the object, which means that the object is an object that we could hold onto, such as clothes or personal items that could later be taken. \n8. There are also many doors that open either with hinges on the sides, or hinges on the top. The object would typically not be directly placed in front of the hinge because that would obstruct access to the opening of the door. \n9. So, the most appropriate object that we could grab out of the doorway is D: doorknobs, which are objects that we can hold onto, and are placed in front of hinges to allow us to open the door.\n\nAnswer: D: doorknows\n\nInput: When the water is warm enough, what should I do with it?

The main purpose of this question is to provide you with an opportunity to demonstrate that you understand how the term \"warm\" is commonly used in relation to \"water\".\n3. The answer will be chosen on the basis of your justifications and how you make the link between \"warm\" and the word that describes the action to be taken on the given condition.\n4. Before making your choice, make sure to analyse all the different actions that might be taken when water is hot enough and match these up with the terms used in the question, as they are used in your everyday life.\n5.

We can also eliminate option B: control panel, as it's not an item that is typically contained by a door, but by a device.\n4. Next, option C: Door opens are clearly not contained by a doorway as they refer to the opening of a door. \n5. So, we can confidently eliminate choice C. \n6. Similarly we can eliminate choice D: doorknobs as there are often more than one such knobs and they don't contain anything.\n7. We can also eliminate choice E: door, as again, they do not contain any objects and are not restricted to a doorway (their function is to open a door). \n8. So, to answer the question, we have to eliminate all the 'false' options (the given ones where it becomes clear that the answer can't be within that choice). This leaves us with choice D: Door knob.\n9. Door knobs allow us to reach out and grab something, which indicates that the object is contained by a door. \n10. So, the answer is A.\nThe question is asking about the activity that a non-pregnant person can't perform. \n11.

We can eliminate option D: doorknobs, because these items are typically found on doors themselves. \n6. Therefore, we are left with options E: doorway and D: door. \n7. The next step is to identify why we can't grab an object contained by the doorway from the door, without considering other elements. 8. If you're grabbing from the door, you need to be able to hold on to the door for support, which can be difficult because of the movement involved in opening the door. 9. So, option E: doorway.\nAnswer: E; doorway\n\nInput: Who are people in the audience waiting for? Choices:  the speaker  the speaker B the speaker C the speaker  a microphone D the speaker  the lights\nRationales: This question is asking us about \"the audience\". It's important to read the exact words used by the question, as that's usually what's important here. \n\"Who are people in the audience\", therefore, implies that the focus is on the audience (plural). A closer look at the choices further indicates one person is mentioned - \"The speaker\" (the speaker) and rest all are in the category of other people: 1. \"The speaker\" 2. \"The lights\" 3. \"The microphone\" 4. \u201cThe speaker's\u201d\nThe audience is a group of people, so we can immediately eliminate two choices: 1. A person (the speaker) 2. A microphone. The reason for eliminating these two choices is because a microphone is a device and a person is an individual.\nTherefore, we can further eliminate from the choices (as the options are still in the same format): 3. \"A speaker's microphone\" as the options do not have the correct format of \"the speaker's\".\nComing down to the very last option \"the speaker's lights\", the correct format remains the same but the words used indicate something quite different", "answer": " 7"}

Choices:  M: the children are younger  A: the children are older B: the children are unaccompanied C: the children are teenagers D: there are more children\nRationales: The reason why choice A: the children are younger is wrong is because we are missing an important clue.  The question \"What is different about a woman who has a child with one woman who is a mother?\"  We are missing important information on what is different about a woman vs a mother. We need to find this. Then, we can answer the real question. \n1. A mother would be different about a woman with and child. \n2. If a woman has a child, then it's obvious that she's not a mother yet because she would be. \n3. But if a mother has a child then she's already a mother and the child would be considered a son/daughter. \n4. So, when it says \"A woman with a child\" it means \"A woman having the child\" (since you are a woman who gave birth to child). \n5. You cannot say \"if a mother has a child versus a woman who had a child. 6. Also, when using \" vs \" in this situation, you have to be careful of using \" is, are, and was \". 7.

So we know the only two choices that involve action are options B (nothing) and E (use a map).\n4. And based on the question being asked, neither of them would be applicable. If you don't have to do anything, it implies that all activities have already been done, meaning that no action is currently required. \n5. The other choices (doing something, moving everything, packing everything, taking the right things, and using a map) are all active, which indicates that a particular task is to be performed by the person in response to a certain set of circumstances or conditions. \n6.

Choices: \tA:  because they are a kid B:  because no one else was going to have fun with them\nRationales: The question asks how would a kid respond to playing in a playground. We can first eliminate the option 'because no one else was going go have fun with them'. The reason for that is that option 'B' does not contain any details that relate to the context of a playground. It's too vague; it doesn't offer details about why a child might want to play in a child-friendly park.\nThe given options are 'because they are a kid' and 'because no one else wants to play with them'. The details in the option 'because they are a child' clearly describes why a kid would want to play in a specific setting that is child-friendly. It's specific and relates to the context. The option 'Because no one else was going with them' doesn't add any details or explanation to why a person might want to play in such a specific setting.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 'because they are a Kid'. Answer: A: because they are a kid", "answer": " 12"}

So, option A is ruled out immediately.\n\n1. Moving to option E, this appears the unlikely answer since \"dog\" is an animal and the given space is probably not one of those where a dog could live.\n2. Looking at choice B, there cannot be any appliances under the kitchen counter. Since Bessie is a real dog, this choice would not be a fitting choice. \n3. Option C seems the likely choice, since dogs are common pets at home and this option does not seem at odds with the contextual information provided.\n4.

Option C: open doors is again an object we can grab, but it doesn't contain objects as it would open to allow objects to freely access it. \n6.

Choices:  G: apple  H: phone  I: shirt  J: spider K: pen L: table M: door\nRationales: The question says that all options will be on the ground within the next ten seconds. \nWe can start by crossing out 'J: spider' and 'K: pen' because they are the only options with words that suggest they would not appear on the floor within ten seconds.\nWe can next cross 'H: phone', because it doesn't make a direct indication that it would be on the floor, but we can say that it is likely to be on the ground by the next ten seconds, so it doesn't fit the requirement of the question.\nThis leaves us with options 'G: apple', 'I: shirt' and 'M: door'.\nSince 'G: apple' and 'I: shirt''s words are likely to indicate them on the ground within ten seconds, they are both likely options.\nHowever, 'I: shirt would be on the floor immediately, as 'on the floor would be a shorter step compared to 'near the floor'.\nThis would most definitely be possible before the next ten seconds is up so option 'G: apple' is the most reasonable answer for this question. \nAnswer: G: apple\n\nInput: When you're out in public you should be what?

It's also unlikely that we would be reaching for a doorway to open a door, so option B: control panel and D: doorknobe can be eliminated. \n4.

Next, we would want to eliminate the choice that contains the most options. Option E: doorway can be eliminated since it is just another way of saying option C: doorway.\n6. We are also eliminating doorway as the answer because if we are referring to the doorway, then only the doorknob or opening the door will be options. \n7. However, the question seems to be referring to a doorway as a container, meaning a doorknob or the door itself would be a choice, not the door or a doorknob. \n8.

Therefore we can eliminate option B: control panel, as it refers to the objects inside rather than the physical location of the panel itself.\n9.

We can also eliminate option B: control panel, as it is an incorrect use of \"control\" as it is used as a \"panel\" which is used to regulate some control mechanism.\n4. We can also eliminate D: doorknobs, because the answer refers to an object rather than an action.\n5. Based on this, we're left with A: open doors, B: open doors, and C: open doors as the remaining choices.\n6. These options suggest grabbing the object from within the doorway, so it is safe to eliminate E: doorway.\n7. Therefore, the answer to the first part of the question is B: open doors.\n8. To find the answer to the entire question we must know the object contained by a door way. We can eliminate options A: television and C: open doors, as they do not contain an object. That leaves us with B: open doors and D: doorknub.\n9. If we look at the rest of the question, we see it asks where the object contained by a doorknob is. Since the object contained by a hand is the object contained by a \"doorknub\", the answer must be in the hand.\n10.

Option D: doorknobs is not directly related to grabbing or an object inside a doorway. \n6. Therefore, our focus now shifts to E: doorway. \n7. It is more likely that this is a case where we grab something inside a doorway. If there is something inside, it is more likely to be a smaller object than a large object because it fits between the door and the door frame. \n8.

Choices:  a. chicken b. pig c. fish d. cows e. pork\nRationales:\n\n1. Questions similar to this often ask what is the most common animal (or species of animal) that is the source of food. \n2. The question asks for the most common animal, indicating preference for a singular animal rather than multiple animals. \n3. Thus, we can rule out options E: pork and B: pig. Both options cite a type of animal that we can eat multiple animals of the type.\n4. Option D: cows can be eliminated as multiple animals of one type of animal being eaten is not common.\n5. Option C: fish can be eliminated when we consider that multiple animals of a single type of animal is already covered in option D: Cows, as a cow is an animal. Plus, the choice A: chicken is still left over as the most common animal as we can kill and eat many chickens in a way that we can kill and eat a single cow (which we can eat many cows).\n6.

We are specifically trying to find/grab one object when contained by a doorway: doorways would typically involve many objects, door knobs may or may not be used for many objects and the answer is not contained.\n6. So, the answer should be an object we use to open a door or doors.\n7. Since the choice is to grab an object from a door, it's the doorknob that has that function: a doorknob is typically what we use to open a closed door.\n8.

The answer contains the keyword \"doing\", which can be either past or present tense.\n2.

It is used to open and close doors and thus, it could also be said that a door knob is included or contained by a doorway because of its location.\n5. Option D: opening doors is similar to option C, except it refers to the action of opening doors, rather than the object itself.\n6. Looking at option E: doorway, it is a type of enclosure or space. \n7. It does not directly contain any specific object, which is why we cannot select this option.\n8.

A doorway, per the dictionary definition, is an opening or doorway, so we can eliminate option E: doorway.\n9. Looking at the remaining options, the only choice that is likely to have objects contained in a doorway is option B: control panel. This is because a doorway is commonly found in places of public transportation, office buildings, malls, and other areas where electronic systems are used to control entry or access in the facility.\n10.

Next we need to look at the features of the room itself as the doorway is contained within it.\n6.

Choices: A: mountain B: forest C: desert D: ocean E: garden\nRationales: The key to this question is in understanding the relationship between a tree and its environment. \n1. A tree requires both nutrients to survive (like in the case of garden) and moisture to grow. \n2. They also require light, which can typically be found in a garden or forest. \n3. In a desert or an ocean, the soil tends to be unsuitable for plant growth. \n4. In a mountain, trees also suffer due to less water-available. \n5. For these reasons, we can eliminate options C: desert, B: forest, and D: ocean. \n6. Option E: garden would allow a tree to grow in the case of sufficient light but would suffocate a tree in the absence of water.\n7. This leaves us with A: mountain. \n8.

Doorknobs are an essential part of doors and openings of doors which is why they can be considered to be part of the door itself and hence cannot be used for solving the task.\n7. A doorway is an opening where a door is placed. Hence, it would be obvious that it is in front of the door itself.\n8.

Looking at the available options, only the character in literature who the author of the literature refers to as The Bride is known to be the bride of christ.\n4. The farmer is a common figure seen in many stories. Similarly, the shepherd is a common animal-related character in stories and legends. \n5.

However, we should begin with a normal reading of the sentence as is. So, let's start by reviewing the term \"architect\". Specifically, the word \"architect\" (noun) describes a person who:\na) makes a structure made of the shape of an arch and\nb) design one out of a material that allows someone to be able to support their own weight on it or build a building from a foundation of it\n2. If we go back to the sentence, the subject is Jim, so he would be a builder, not an architect. What Jim does, and who we are told he is, is quite different to the actual meaning of \"architect\". A builder (noun) is someone who:\na) constructs something in a way that is useful for someone else and\nb) builds it from what someone provides\n3. Now a builder can work in multiple professions. For example, they could be a builder in the carpentry profession (D), or a builder in the construction profession (E). Now, there are differences in what both professions do, so it is important to note that a builder", "answer": " 2"}

C. near the doctors' offices 4. D. near the nursing stations 5. E. near the waiting rooms\nRationales: The question is asking, in which place have old persons to be in hospital? Answer is E. near the waiting room.\nReasoning:\n\n1. Emergency rooms are only for people who're suffering from serious or life threatening emergencies, and old people usually do not need to be in the hospital emergency room.\n2. Most of the other choices are either inside the hospital or not in the hospital at all.\n3. For example, near the doctors' 'offices' is inside the hospital and 'near the nursing stations' is not in the hospital. If an old person is in the hospital, he or she wouldn't be at or near a place that isn't inside the hospital.\n4. Similarly, \"near the waiting rooms\" is within the hospital because the people who wait there come to the hospital themselves as patients (therefore, waiting room is in the same building). \n5. Therefore, we can narrow it down to the answers that don't suggest someone who is inside the hospital or who isn't currently in the hospital at all (the person who is in the hospital will not be in the waiting room before admittance).\n6. In other words, it can't be 'in the emergency room' or 'in the lobby', because that would imply that old people might be in the hospital emergecy room or lobby.\n7.

{"text": "object in its own right, and is not constrained in any way by a doorway. \n3. Then, option C: open door can be eliminated as it refers to the act of opening rather than the state of being opened. \n4. Similarly, option E: doorway can also be eliminated as it doesn't specify whether the \"doorway\" is open or closed; it is just a placeholder for a doorway in general.\n5. That leaves us with B: Control Panel and D: doorknobs as our two remaining options. \n6. The control panel is typically found inside a doorway and does not refer to an object that is inside the doorway. \n7. Looking at doorknobs, we're told in the question that the object is constrained by the \"doorway\", and we know a doorknob is found on the outside of a door, so we can eliminate D: doorknabs. \n8. That leaves us with option B: Control Panel, which explains that we would grab an object contained by the interior door of a doorframe. The doorframe in itself is not something we would grab unless it's for opening it, just as we would not go searching for the interior doorknob unless we're trying to unlock the door. \n9.

However, these are options that we would not normally grab to move an object out of a doorway.\n5. Hence, we have to use our intuition again and consider options E: door and B: doorway.\n6. Door and doorway are both choices that refer to the whole door, from the outside to the inside. Within the door we can find a doorknob, the hinges, as well as any objects that could also be carried out of the doorway.\n7. Therefore, the correct answer is B: doorway.

First, we can eliminate the non-real options like \"tapestry\" and \"sour candy\", which are not things a person on TV would realistically take at the store.\n2. Since a person on TV would be on a TV, he would be interacting with characters that are part of that world.\n3. Therefore his choices would be limited to things he'd usually find in that setting or in settings closely resembling that one.\n4. For instance, when a person is on TV, they would mostly be going places where they've been going to in the show or which are otherwise relevant.\n5. And there's probably no need to take things which are unnecessary to a TV show or which add little value to a TV show.\n6.

This shows that while taking a break at the workplace, we can perform a number of activities.\n3. We need to pick one activity as the answer.\n4. From the list of activities, we find that eating, singing, taking a deep breath, walking, and doing nothing are all possible (we can't say sleeping, because sleeping isn't something we typically do at our workplace or on a break time).\n5.

However, the word \"control\" is slightly ambiguous and could refer to a button or lever to open or close the doorway, which does not fulfil the condition of being contained by a doorway specifically.\n4. Option C: opening doors is also not a good fit, as doorways don't necessarily open.\n5. This leaves options D: doorknobs and E: doorways. We can eliminate option D: doorknobb since it is a different term than the one used in the question, and there is also the possibility that a doorknob could be used to grab or open a door. Doorknobs are also not necessarily an object contained inside a doorway specifically. Therefore, we can eliminate option D: door knob.\n6.

A: out of habit B: to write important things C: out of boredom D: for free E: I'm not good a technology\nRationales: First, there are a few important things to understand about the question to correctly determine why people write letters on paper.\n1. The question is phrased as either a statement or a question, as the punctuation could be a period or a question mark. In this case, it is a question, which means that you should answer in the affirmative or negative.\n2. The prefix \"de\" indicates negation and negation can only be used in statements to convey the opposite thought.\n3. The structure in this case would thus be \"I do not (write letters on paper)\" and is answered with a negative \"I don't write letters on paper\".\n4. This is critical to realize so that you don't accidentally provide the incorrect answer or get stuck on the question.\n5. In this case, we have the options A: out of habit, B: to write important thing, C: out of boring, D: for free, and E: I'm no good at technology.\n6. Looking at all the choices, none of them refer to circumstances where people simply don't write letters, but where they either do write letters or where they write letters occasionally.\n7.

What remains are options C: open doors and B: control panel. The control panel is a good target if we're trying to use it to manipulate, control or otherwise interact with the door, because it is often located near the doors or where the electronics that open or control the door can be easily accessed or operated, not so much for grabbing objects.\n5.

Choices: A: resting B: comfortable C: not able D: having E: moving\nRationales: Considering the question, the boy in the chair would either be: 1. \"standing\" because the choice requires us to assume a situation where the boy is not sitting. 2. \"sitting on the chair\" if the choice required us to assume the boy is \"chairless\".\n\nBased on these, we come to the conclusion that the choice would not be the most appropriate when combined in the context of the statement. The correct answer would be C: \"not able\". \nAnswer: C: not able\n\nInput: Some people get upset when they forget to use a toaster? Choices: 1. A: because they want bread and toast. 2.

Option A can be understood as \"because they want toast and bread\", but there is no contextual reference to \"getting upset\". This option cannot be considered. 2. Option B can be understood as \"Because the toaster is only as old as they are\", yet toasting bread would not be affected by the age of a toaster. This option cannot be considered as well. 3.

Choices: 1) A: cross street B) go back 2)  C) go back in store D) buy it E) talk to others\nRationales: The question asks what the man did after seeing a store.\n1. Going back in the store is the obvious choice.\n2.  The other choices are not correct. \nThe next choices are: \"A: go back\", \"C: go back in\". These options mean that the man went back to the store even if he saw it through another person's eyes or in a dream.\n4. \"Buy it\" refers to buying the item, not seeing or interacting with it.\n5. \"Talk to others\" is an action we take to interact with another person.

{"text": "object that is too bulky to easily move through doorways.\n3. Similarly, option B (control panel) is not likely to be found in a doorway.\n4. To further narrow down the answers, we need to look at the choices that involve a doorway.\n5. Doorway is the main choice here, as it is the only option referring to a physical object that acts as a way to the doorway.\n6. As such, we can discard the rest of the options that involve just a doorway.\n7. The remaining choice therefore has to do with objects that are inside or in proximity to the doorway, hence the option E: doorway.\n8. So, the answer is E: doorway. It is also a viable choice to move the entire doorway since it is a closed structure.\nAnswer: E. doorway.\n\nInput: Which is more likely to see more than one of? Choices: A:  a b c B:  a b d C:  d c b D:  c d a E: a d b\nRationales: First off, the question is asking about which is more likely to see 2 or more of something rather than 1 of something. \n2. There are 2 options for which we can make this determination.\n3. They are \"c\" and \"d\", which means we will disregard all options starting with \"b\".\n4. \"a b\" is a combination of two numbers, unlike \"a d\" or \"d c\", which are single numbers.\n5. If we are choosing 2 or more of the options, we have to be choosing more than one of a pair, rather than just choosing one of the pair as these would not be more than one of the pair as such.\n6. So, out of all the listed options, the only one we can use to say that we are choosing more than one of something is the option C: d c b.\n7. Thus, \"b\" is \"c\" and so, we end up with our only remaining option being E: a d b.\n8. Hence, the answer has to be E: a d b, which means one is at least twice as likely to see more than 1 of the pair then to see less than 1 of the same pair.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: Where is the", "answer": " 6"}

Choices: \u25fb A: walls B: rooftop C: floors D: water heater E: countertops\nRationales: Steps:\n1. The question tells us that water could be used as a building material.\n2. We need to consider ways that water can be applied or used in construction or building.\n3. All the given options are ways in which water can be used in buildings.\n4. But if we apply the premise of this question to the options, we would have to determine which of these options could actually be used as a building block. \n5. For this, we would have to explore whether the options could realistically or feasibly be applied as a building material. \n6. For example, the option A: walls clearly cannot be used as a building since walls are, obviously, a part of a building.\n7. The option B: rooftops is clearly not used for building on its own in the real world. A rooftop is a structure above the highest point of a building as part of a roofing system. \n8. The option C: floors is clearly not a building material, as floors are part of a building; floors cover the top of a building or a floor can be an area within a room on that level, but they are never a building material in themselves \n9. Since none of the options fit, we should then consider the ones which least match up with the requirements.\n10. For this, the easiest way would be to compare the options to the given premise. So we can eliminate D: water heater and E: countertops, as these do not clearly refer to water being applied as a", "answer": " 72"}

Likewise, option C: opening doors, refers to the whole collection of doors without any specific mention of an object being contained inside of any specific one of these doors.\n5. Option D: doorknobs is the same. Doorknobs are components of a door but not the doorway itself.\n6. Option E: doorway, however, is the correct answer. We may pick up or grab an object that is 'contained' inside of a doorway, especially when there's a door open.\n7.

Let there be two children, one on first floor and the other on second floor. The child standing on second floor can throw the ball either towards the top of the tree to the point of landing on the top of the tree then directly down, or over the first floor towards the ground.

From the context, we know that we're talking about a doorway, such as a hallway door in a building.\n5. It's unlikely that a doorway would contain a control panel. It's a feature that could conceivably be found in a building, if the structure is old enough to have these.\n6. So to get a better understanding of what is or could typically be found in doorways that's more appropriate than option B, we'll consider the remaining choices.\n7. Of the remaining choices, only door D: doorknobs resembles a common type of object found in doorways.\n8. A doorknob is the part of a door that you hold to open the door.\n9. Given the available context, the question seems to only ask about situations where a person could potentially be holding a door to open it, so options C: opening doors, and E: doorway do not make much sense as choices, because we don't assume we would have to be holding the door to access the object in the doorway.\n10. And option option B: control panel is just as questionable as option A: televisions.\n11. So finally, the answer to this riddle seems to be option D: doorknails.\n\n###\n\n##\n###", "answer": " 10"}

Similarly, option B: control panel, is not a physical object, rather a component of a larger device, hence, we can eliminate option C: panel. \n4. Option D: doorknobs isn't contained by the doorway, it's the mechanism for opening or closing the door. \n5. Now, looking at the remaining choices - option A: television and option E: doorway - we know that we are looking for an object contained by a physical doorway. As such, option A: television can be eliminated, because it isn't contained by a doorway, since it's not the type of object that fits inside a physical doorway.\n6. Option E: doorway can't be the answer either, because it's the physical container of the object itself.\n7. So, option D: door handle must be the answer to this question. \n8. However, given the context of the question, this answer makes no sense, since we can't use a door to grab the object!\n9. Therefore, we need to eliminate this answer, which leaves us with option C: opening doors. \n10. Opening a door is a typical action to retrieve an object that has been placed inside a doorway by someone else. For example, in a hotel room or house, a guest might place an object on the side of the door and when they want to use the object, the guest would need to retrieve it by opening the door and reaching in to the doorway to retrieve the object.\n11. Opening the door and reaching out and retrieving an object that is placed on the doorway is therefore the correct answer.\nAnswer: C: opening doors\n\nInput: Where could a person use the same color as their hair?

{"text": "object that is contained elsewhere.\n3. The words 'control panel' and 'opening doors' probably refer to different kinds of doorways, so we can eliminate option B: control panel and option D: doors.\n4. The word 'doorknob' is a piece of hardware and not part of the doorway, so we can eliminate it. \n5. That leaves us with two options: E: doorway and C: doorway.\n6. 'Doorway' is a noun phrase that refers to the opening in a door, or passageway that allows an object or person to pass through.\n7. Therefore, we can be reasonably sure that option C: doorway is the right answer.\nAnswer: C: doorway\n\nInput: What can you learn about a home from its entrance? Choices:  Precious metals A: Above B: Below C: Outside D: Inside E: Center\nRationales:\n\n1. First, we need to define what we mean by 'entrance'.\n2. According to the question, this refers to any part of the house that serves to enter into or exit the house.\n3. However, most houses generally have only one entrance, which typically takes up a limited space. \n4. Therefore, a home's 'entrance' will typically be outside of the house rather than inside.\n5. Now, let's look at the options, 'Above', 'Below', 'Outside', and 'Center' of the home. Here we can see that all of these options involve outdoor components of the house.\n6. However, we can eliminate 'Below' and 'Center' because these terms relate to the placement of the house or part of the house relative to other components. \n7. Therefore, the remaining options, 'Above' and 'Outside', both clearly relate to components of the house that are present outside of the home.\n8. So, the answer is below: C: Outside\nAnswer: Outside, which refers to components of the house, such as a front door, that are present outside of a home.\n\nInput: In the room described by the writer, the main door was opened by what?

'Doorknob' is a type of object that is often outside of doorways, whereas 'doorway' is actually a structure that could contain an object.\n7. Since 'doorknob' is the most likely type of object we would need to grab from a doorway, we can eliminate its option. It would be very rare to need to grab 'doorway' from a doorway.\n8.

Choices: \nA: windy B: south wind C: west wind D: north wind E: east wind\nRationales: If a person is heading to the park in the direction of the wind, the \"wind\" in this case, is from the \"back\" of the person, so the person would be facing the \"front\" direction.\n\nHere we can use the 4 cardinal directions to determine the wind's orientation using the clock. The \"front\" direction is \nwhen you're looking at the 12-hour clock, it's the 12'o clock direction. The wind, when it's coming from behind you, \nis coming from the direction of the 3'o clock that points to the 12' o'clock direction.\n\nSo, option B & Option C, which both refer to the south wind, and option D and option E which both refer to the north wind are \nall incorrect.

As \"winds\" can be \nstrong or weak depending upon their condition, we can differentiate these two options based on the strength of the wind. \n\nWe know that option A: \"windsy\" refers to strong winds.

Choices: \tA: go B: bathroom C: classroom D: bathoom E: water\nRationales:1. Let's start by analyzing the question: why would I use the toillet (toilet being the only word that is written with a capital letter) in the middle of my (the) class? This implies that I would not use the toilet because the bathroom is located near my class, but because I would use the toilet specifically in the middle (meaning not on the side) of my class.\n2. If I were to sit on the toilet during my class, I would be inside the bathoom. However, this isn't what the question asks.\n3. Therefore what does the question ask? It asks why I would use the toillet inside the bathoom in the middle of my clash.\n4. Now, what is meant by inside the bathoom in middle of my class? Here, the word \"bathoom\" doesn't refer to the bathroom itself but to what is inside the bathroom. Therefore, the question asks: why would I use... the toilet in my class? This implies me using the toilet during class and not using the bathroom.\n5. What kind of toilet could I use during a class? A portable toilet.\n6. What is the definition of a portable toilet? It's a temporary toilet that doesn't contain a waste-storage tank.\n7. So, in my class, I could simply use a portable toilette containing a water tank to go to the bathroom.\n8. So, the answer", "answer": " 24"}
{"text": "object that should be contained in a room and not by a doorway. Similarly, option B: control panel can be eliminated, as well. Not an object typically found in many room settings.\n3. Moving then to option C: opening doors, this would be an appropriate choice if the object was contained within a doorway. An example of this would be a drawer within a cabinet. As the drawer's opening faces the doorway, you can reach the drawer through the doorway. However, in this case, the word \"doorway\" can refer to the whole space that is occupied by a door. We then can easily eliminate option D: doorknobs, although there could be an instance of a doorknob being contained in a doorway. It does not fit the question asked, though, as the question asks where to grab an object that is inside a doorway.\n4. We now are left with option E: doorway, which can be any open space that surrounds a door.\n5. So, to answer the question, we need to reach an object that is contained within that doorway, so we should grab it within that space too.\n6. The only option that can be gripped inside a doorway would an object at the opening of a doorway.

Next, we need to understand what the word contained means. It means that the object is fully or partially enclosed within a doorway.\n4. Now, from the remaining three options (C: opening doors, D: doorknobs E: doorway), we can eliminate option C. Opening doors usually mean a door or door frame and not a doorway.\n5. Option D: doorknubs can't be grabbed as there is no object in the doorway.\n6. Finally, we are left with option E: doorway as this is the only option that fully meets the description of the question.

{"text": "example of an object that is NOT contained by a doorway (although the question itself doesn't rule that out).\n3. The same goes for option B: control panel. \n4. Now we check option C: opening doors. This choice describes the action of opening the doors, which is in fact a type of movement of an object containing its doorway.\n5. But that \"movement\" itself is not an \"object\" in the sense that the question implies. So we can eliminate option C.\n6. The same goes for the choice D: door Knob. Although again it's possible to use a door knob to \"grab\" an object, the term \"grab\" implies the action of grasping a hold of it. In reality, the action of opening a door doesn't involve a \"grab\". It's more of a push. So option D can be eliminated, too.\n7. Now, finally, we're left with option E: doorway. This wording indicates the object is a doorway, which is something that contains (holds) other objects.\n8. So, from this perspective, the \"doorway\" itself is an object that contains other objects. We can \"grab\" the \"doorway object\" to hold onto it and potentially move it around. This makes choice E the correct answer.\nAnswer: C: opening doors\n\nInput: Where does a spider come from?

The first answer option is home, where multiple spiders live in each home.\n2. The second option is a bed, where spiders often live.\n3. The third option is into the home, which is how any spider can get into a home. We also need to include this among our answers, since we just said that any spider can get in wherever it likes.\n4.

{"text": "object with no specific shape or size, which could be contained in other locations as well.\n3. Similarly, option B: control panel, is also an impractical choice as the control panel is part of a system and not an object with a shape, i.e. it can't be considered the \"object contained by the doorway\" and cannot be physically grabbed.\n4. We can further eliminate option C: opening doors, since the doors don't actually contain any object but serve as a form of transportation.\n5. Now from the remaining options, we need to identify what it is about option D: doorknobs that makes them likely to contain objects.\n6. Door handle/doorknob typically has a cylindrical shape, which is likely to contain smaller-sized objects such as pens, keys, etc.\n7.

Option B: control panel probably refers to a handle of some kind, such as that of a crane or an elevator, which wouldn't be considered contained within a doorway.\n4. Option C: open doors indicates the act of opening or closing a door, and not of moving a door. Since the question is about grabbing an object that is contained within a door, option C can be disregarded.\n5. Option D: door knob is the closest noun to the required physical act. \n6. We only need to determine whether a door knob would be considered contained by a doorway or not. \n7. A door knob generally requires a space for it to be attached to a door, hence its function is to actually open a door or hold it in place.\n8. It is this function of 'opening or holding a door' that allows the door knob to be considered an object held and/or opened within a doorway. \n9.

Choices:  B: farmer C: child D: parent E: pet owner\nRationales: First, we need to understand \"bark\" in this context. It would most likely be used as a verb to describe the act of a dog making noise/sound, so the noun \"bark\" would more likely refer to the sound that a dog makes.\nWith this, the question would really be asking if there is a person who is not prepared to hear the sound that a dog would make.\nLooking at the options, we find that there is only one noun that doesn\u2019t seem to make logical sense if a dog bark: \u201cpet owner\u201d.\nHowever, to be sure let us think about what \u201cpet owner\u201d is. It means one who tends animals as a pastime or business. That doesn\u2019t really make logical sense to the given context, so we can eliminate \u201cpet owner\u201d from the choices.\nAmong the remaining options, we find that \u201cchild\u201d can easily be eliminated as we don\u2019t really expect or want children to hear a dog bark, so it is", "answer": " 96"}

Option E: doorway, however, includes the presence of an object inside the doorway, indicating we could grab it from here.\n6.

Doorknob can \"grab\" something because it is a pointy object on a door. However, an option's wording is irrelevant because if the wording is \"where would I grab doorknob\", one could argue that \"where would I grab the pointy object on the door?\" would be an option by definition.\n5. Doorknob is a physical object which is attached to the door so, we can eliminate it.\n6.

Next, we should consider the other three remaining choices. B: control panel and C: opening doors can both refer equally to a door-opening mechanism that would be used to open a doorway. \n5. If we use option B, then option C would be redundant. If we use option C, then it would mean that option B could be used instead, making it redundant again. Therefore, we can eliminate B: control panel and we're down to just option C: opening doors.\n6. Now, we can see that the four remaining options refer to items that could be contained by a doorway, making the choice somewhat difficult to decide. \n7. The answer is D: doorknobs, which are the part of a door on which we grab to open them. If the door is already open, you won't be able to grab the doorknob. \n8. So, if the door is shut, you would grab the doorknub to open the door, meaning that the doorknub would be contained inside the doorway. \n9.

The question does not say \"into the garden\" which would mean from inside the garden, implying that the door is coming from outside the garden.\n\n2.

Thus we can eliminate choice C: stove since, as previously mentioned, the word \"from\" cannot be used to indicate when something comes inside.\n\n5.

We can eliminate option D: Doorknob, because doorknobs are typically not held within the structure that represents the doorway but rather outside the door on the frame itself.\n5. Thus what remains are options E: doorway and C: opening doors. We know that opening doors is what allows an object to be grabbed from within a doorway. An example of this would be using a handle on the door to open doors and then being able to grab your book (a contained object) that you left behind on the counter.\n6. Therefore the answer is that we can grab the object we want from within the doorway by using the open door. Therefore the correct answer is C: opening doors.\nAnswer: C: opening doors\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following graded math question.\n### Demontration:\n### Input: When the light bulb was changed to a 60-watt bulb, which choice did not occur to most people? Choices: \t A: the electric company B: the bulb itself C: the light D: the switch E: the electrician\n### Rationales: 1) First, an important thing to know about a light bulb is that it has resistance and has a certain resistance rating (such as \u2018A60\u2019). So a \u201860-watt lightbulb\u2019 doesn\u2019t actually have 60 W of power output. It actually has a rating of about 12.5 W, and this is because the electricity flowing through a lightbulb loses some of its energy as it gets converted to heat. \n2) So now that we know about the lightbulb and its relation to resistance, we need to figure out what actually decreases in wattage when we substitute a lighter light bulb for a fatter one. The answer is: It\u2019s the light bulb itself. \n3) Let\u2019s continue. When we switch the light bulb from a 40-watt to a 60 watt bulb,", "answer": " 22"}

Next, we can eliminate option D: doorknobs, as it is a door component but it is not contained by a doorway, nor does it contain anything.\n4. Next, we can also eliminate option E: doorway, as it is a component of the door but not an object.\n5. So, we are left with only option C: Control panel. Control panels are often found inside doorways and are usually used to control a function in the room. This matches what's being asked, and is the correct answer.\nAnswer: C: control panel\n\nInput: During the test, I was surprised that which of the following had two answers? Choices: A: 1+2 B: 6+9 C: 10-3 D: 14+1 E: 80-5\nRationales: There are many different types of questions we can find on a test. The answer to these questions depends on the subject matter they are related to. 1+2 would make no sense for math, but it would make complete sense in science, for example.\nIntermediate Reasoning Stepsi: 1. The given choices should first be analyzed in the context of their common characteristics. A key aspect here is to discern if and how they can be linked to each other. \n2. In the given question choices, we can see that several share a common characteristic that makes them easier to understand together.\na. Each choice has two answers, hence the common characteristic is in relation to \"two\".\nb. By grouping options that share similar characteristics in order to isolate a common element, we can proceed to the next step of intermediate reasoning.\n3. By grouping relevant options into categories, we remove redundant options and focus on the ones that share common characteristics. \n4. In this case, we can now consider options with the same characteristic with another characteristic in common. \n5. In this case, all the remaining options have \"two answers\" in common. \n6. So, we can eliminate all the choices except for E: 80 - 5. \n7. As the options now become simpler, we can use the remaining information, i.e., the phrase \"during the test\", as a point of reference to guide us in the final step of intermediate reasoning. \n8", "answer": " 31"}
{"text": "object that is not commonly expected to be contained by a doorway and is unlikely to be found inside.\n3. Option B: control panel could refer to a remote, or the control panel within a piece of machinery. However, a control panel is not commonly found inside a doorway. Moreover, the phrase \"contained by the doorway\" is used to indicate that the door holds the object inside, not vice-versa. Therefore, the control panel could be in a room that doorway leads into, but not inside the doorway itself.\n4. Similarly, we can eliminate option C: opening doors, as these cannot be commonly expected to lead to an object contained by a specific door.\n5. Similarly, we can also eliminate option D: doorknobs. This is only used for opening a door and the phrasing indicates that the object is contained by the doorway itself. This could be a door, a cabinet or other storage unit. However, the object we are seeking to find is not commonly expected to fall into any of these categories.\n6. Option E: doorway gives us our final answer. We are looking for an object that is being contained by the doorway, which makes it logical to choose the doorway as the place to look for that object.\n7.

Choices:  E: video game C: chess B: darts D: bowling A: bicycle Golf\nRationales: So, the task was asking which of these games were difficult to play.\n1. I first focused my attention on looking at how difficult each of these games were to play.\n2. Video games can have an endless number of difficulties that can vary depending on each individual. As a general rule, if a person is playing a standardized video game, this should be easier for them than a typical golf round.\n3. Chess is not an endless, one-person game. Once a move has been made, a game would typically end. With video games, the gameplay would not end until the person has completed the game. \n4. Darts, although not a video game, still involves some skill and strategy that would need to be applied in each game. Bowling has physical requirements that aren't as difficult to meet as chess, but these aren't present in video games.\n5. Golf seems a little farfetched when you consider that if it involves some skill and strategy, video games have that and more. Golf typically consists of shooting different colored golf balls at targets, and this can all be done through a joystick on a game console. Thus, video games are more difficult to play.\n6. Therefore the answer is A: video game.\nAnswer: A : video game\n\nInput: The baker gave the boy a bag of _______ to get him through his morning routine. Choices:  A.", "answer": " 11"}
{"text": "electronic device we often see in other rooms in our home.\n3. We can also rule out option B: control panel, as this object is found in or near elevators and not in doorways.\n4.

Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement that the object it contains can be grabbed as we walk through the door.\n5. Moving along, let's rule out option D: doorknobs, as these objects are found on door surfaces and not contained within them.\n6. Next, we examine question option E: doorway. A doorway can, in fact, be a place where something is grabbed. So, it is still possible that this option is correct in some sense.\n7. By process of elimination, we can eliminate options B, C and D from the list.\n8. At this point, the options A and E are the only remaining choices.\n9. Since option E is the doorway itself and not an object, it is impossible to grab anything here.\n10. So, the answer has to be A, the television, as this is an object that can indeed be grabbed within a doorway itself.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: Which of these is a reason that the boy in the story is so smart?

This leaves us with the remaining three options. Of these three, option E: doorway is the only one that would require us to grab an item contained by the doorway. \n7. This is because grabbing the doorway implies grasping the door frame, and the door frame is itself contained within the doorway as a part of its structure. Therefore, the answer to the puzzle is E: doorway.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: In what sport should players try to avoid striking against other players?

The two words 'avoid' and 'hit' in the question should be taken into account while answering the question.\n\nThis refers to a sport where the players are in direct contact. Hence, only cricket is ruled out since this involves no direct contact at all.\nTennis does involve ball-striking, but the other players are out on the court itself so no direct contact should occur between the two players.\nBaseball does not involve direct ball-striking at all, and both players are on the field.\nGolf also rules out players on the field as there is no player hitting against another one on the field.\nThus, the correct option is B: cricket", "answer": " 44"}

Option D: doorknobs are found on the inside or outside of a doorway and thus would not be an object contained in a doorway, so D is also incorrect. \n5. Now, the remaining options E: doorway and F: door are similar. A door can be described as a doorway, and vice versa. Hence, the two options can be seen as interchangeable.\n6. Therefore we can choose whichever we find more appropriate. Among the given options, E: doorway seems to be a more descriptive answer.\n7. The remaining question is whether the option E: doorway makes sense. \n8. For options B: control panel, C: opening doors, D: door knob, and F: door, we can understand that they are all part or constituents of a door. \n9. Since B: control panel and C: opening doors both seem to serve the purpose of opening a door, they both essentially function as the doors themselves.\n10.

Choices: 1) A: doorway - B: window - C: bed - D: floor - E: couch 2) A: couch - B: bed - C: floor\nRationales: Partial List:\n1. \"Centered\" and \"leading\" suggests that the perspective would be focused on one specific aspect of the environment.\n2. The view will center on the man.\n3. \"Centering\" the man could mean that the man would either be shown alone, sitting or sleeping.\n4. Looking through the list, the options that do not fit the criterion as outlined above are: bed, doorway (since this will make the man walk through a doorway), couch, and window.\n5. Therefore the answer is B: bed.\n6. The question asks to choose the viewpoint that would be centered on the leading man.\n7. \"Centered on the leading man\" would imply that the leading man would either be shown up close by himself, or that his entire body would be shown on frame.\n8. The options that do not fit this criteria are A and D.\n9. \"A: doorway\" contradicts the criteria given that doorways would have the leading man walk through them. It could also imply that he will be", "answer": " 120"}
{"text": "object that is contained in a different space other than the doorway.\n3. Now, option C: opening doors only mentions the doors and does not refer to contained objects in the doorway.\n4. Moving to option D: doorknobs, we have to reconsider this option. The doorknob itself will not be contained in the doorway. Instead, the door will be the structure that contains both the door knob and the door.\n5. Looking over the other options, we can eliminate option E: doorway, as it mentions the doorway itself and not a contained object inside of it.\n6. Moving back to option C: opening doors, we can eliminate it because it doesn't refer to the object that it refers to being contained, which is not an item in the doorway. The doorway itself is not an item in itself and contains an item. To contain an item, we require an item to be a part of the containing item and be contained. This does not correspond to option C because the door is neither an item nor is it part of a containing item.\n7. Therefore, the only remaining answer choice that fulfills the description of the question is B: control panel.\n8. So, the correct answer is B: control panel", "answer": " 13"}
{"text": "object that is typically outside of doorways.\n3. The options B: control panel and D: doorknobs are also unlikely. Control panels on doors are generally just a small panel with buttons and sensors, which might be difficult to access from within a doorway. Doorknobs are also typically located outside of the doorway, although they can be accessed from within the doorway.\n4. The option E: doorway can refer to either the interior doorway, or to the doorway of a room. However, the word \"doorway\" is an intransitive verb, which means it cannot take the object 'object', as in \"grab the object contained by the doorway\" would be incorrect.\n5. There is only one remaining choice; C: opening doors, which refers to the part of the door that opens and closes, and can be accessed from inside the doorway. \n6. Therefore, C: opening doors is the only answer.\nAnswer: C: opening doors\n\nInput: What might someone see that is behind her toes? Choices:  What they can see behind them.\nRationales: This is a tricky question. While the answer can seem obvious\u2014 \"What can someone see behind them.\"\u2014this choice does not directly answer the question.\nThere is a subtle clue in the question to help the asker arrive at the correct choice.\nLet's look more closely at the question.\n\n1. The first thing to notice is that this question asks: \"What can someone [sic] see that is behind her [sic]...\"?\n2. The use of the words \"see\" and \"behind\" in the question itself suggests we are looking for an answer to be something related to vision or sight\u2014\"seeing\" or \"being seen\"\u2014rather than something physical, like the toes themselves. \n3. Furthermore, there are only two choices that deal with visuals: \"see\" or \"behind\".\n\n4. Another clue is the use of the phrase \"that is behind her toes\".\n\n5. This phrase specifically refers to an image or visualization of something behind her toes from her perspective\u2014\"she seeing it from her perspective\"\u2014and suggests we are looking for something she can see rather than anything else. \n\n6.

{"text": "object of a particular kind and not necessarily the type of object our question is asking for.\n3. Moving on to options B and C, we can eliminate option C since control panels are more likely to be found in industrial or technical settings and doorknobs are more common in residential settings.\n4. So, we can identify option B: control panel as a good choice for the object in doorway.\n5. However, when we look at options D and E, both of them are places where you would most often find a doorway. Since our question is about an item contained in a doorway, those choices are not possible in their own right. \n6. So, our only option is E: doorway.\n7. This is because in doorways, we typically find things that are usually enclosed within that space. The space itself can be considered as the doorway's \"contained object\".\n8. This means the only choice that is left is E: doorway as the place to go to grab the object contained within it.\n9. We can simplify this even more by saying the space itself is the object contained within the doorway.\n10. Therefore, the answer must be E: door itself.\nAnswer: E : door itself.\nInput: What can you not store in a can? Choices: 1. A: coffee 2. B: milk 3. C: spaghetti 4. D: cheese E: eggs F: bread G: hamburger meat\nRationales:\n\n1. To understand this question, we need to establish the most common things that one can store in cans.\n2. A can typically contains food (e.g. canned food items) or drinks (e.g. soda, beer).\n3. So we can eliminate options with items that are typically placed in cans (options C, D, E, and G).\n4. Based on this, the answer should be B: milk. Milk typically comes in cans, so we can eliminate options A, C, D, E and G.\n5. But there can be a few more options besides milk, which may not normally come inside cans, like hamburger meat (option F).\n6. We have to understand that options have only two choices, either \"you can store it in a can\" or \"you can'", "answer": " 23"}

Eliminating option B: control panel, makes sense since it is a doorway that controls access to a large room such as a hallway or a stage and would not normally contain an object beyond the doors.\n4. Eliminate option C: opening doors, as this doesn't refer to the opening of a single door doorway. Rather, it seems to be referring to a series of double or sliding doors that open to a larger space. \n5. Lastly, elimiate option E: doorway, as the object can't be contained by the doorway if it is not inside the doorway.\n6. The choices left are B: control panel and D: doorknobs.\n7. Looking at B: control panel, this makes sense since it is the first or last of several doorways that could possibly contain something within the doorway. However, the object is not necessarily being 'grabbed'.\n8. Looking into D: Doorknob, this option makes sense. It is common for doorknobsto contain another item when they form a doorway.\n9.

Option C: doorway is included in the question itself, and can be eliminated. \n5. Looking at option D: doorknobs alone, the question is asking about object contained within a doorway and we already know option D will be related to a doorway, so we eliminate D. \n6. The options left are A: television and B: opening doors.\n7. When objects are contained in a doorway, they are not necessarily contained in a doorway in the manner in which they would in an apartment or house. \n8. We are typically describing objects as being \"contained by\" or even just \"through\" a doorframe. \n9. An example of this is at a store where we might see products in a display \"through\" a doorway.\n10. Therefore, we can eliminate option A: television.\n11. Option B: opening doors is the correct answer. \n12. It refers to opening doors to allow something to travel through, such as a human or another object in a doorway. 13. This type of opening door indicates the door is serving as a doorframe as opposed to a barrier to separate objects inside a doorframe.\n14. In summary, the correct answer is option B: opening doors.

Books can fit inside this cupboard, but they would have to be stacked in such a way that they don't topple over, creating an awkward and potentially dangerous situation. \n2. B: bookshelf: There are no shelf units that can be directly placed over this book. This option would allow the book to stand on its own, but would not be ideal due to its potential for tipping over when handled.\n3.

Since the correct answer is C, it is crucial to determine why the panel would be the one to choose. \n5. Well, the most common objects that are used to grab doorways are doorknobs and doorknobs often come in the form or a door handle. Door handles that feature gripping surfaces that are located in a doorway or door frame would serve similar purposes as a doorknob.\n6. Therefore option E, with the doorway label is the intended answer, as it is the only one that is an object that can be grasped. \n7.

B: listen to music 4. E: work and 5. D: talk on phone \nRationales: Given that getting to work is a more effective means to passing time, the answer for this choice should be the one that leads us closer to our destination, which is the workplace and not the activity that is being performed. \n1. The choices of talking on phone, drinking coffee (option A), listening to music (option B) and working (option E) lead towards time passing, so these are not the choices.\n2. Driving also does not directly provide the result of working, so option D: talk on phone cannot be the correct answer.\n3. Similarly, option E: work will be time-passing, so it has to be rejected.\n4. This leaves us with only three choices: A: coffee, B: listen to music and C: drive.\n5. Since the result of these activities is not work or other activities that may be time-consuming, such as drinking coffee or enjoying our music, options A: coffee and B: listen to music are eliminated. \n6.

First, we need to figure out the kind of person most likely to get up and go to work on time at 5:0 a.m.\n2. If we pick a random choice, then we run the risk of overlooking something important.\n3. But if we look through every choice first, then we quickly realize that only choices E, H, I, and P correspond with being early risers and capable of going to work on time.\n4. However, after considering which of these choices seems the most likely, we begin to realize that only choices E and H are people who are woken up by their loved ones.\n5. From a societal standpoint, this suggests that a human or a woman is the more likely candidate for going to work on time at such an ungodly hour.\n6. So, it would appear that choices H and I do not relate to getting up on time at 5 AM because they are not woken up by their families most likely.\n7. However, since only choices E and H remain, we cannot definitively say that either choice is the most likely candidate for waking up early to go to work.\n8.

The same can apply to option C: door opener. \n5. Now that we've eliminated several possible options, we can move to options D: doorknobs and E: doorways.\n6. Since the question indicates that the object is contained by a door, we can eliminate option D: doorknub, since the doorknob itself would be outside the door. \n7. We can also reject the option E: doorways, since the object itself would be inside the door, not outside it. \n8.

In the case of door opening, we can also eliminate option C: opening doors, as its nature only allows us to \"open\" the door but not \"grab\" something inside a doorway.\n5. Now, let's go through the remaining options.\n6. Doorway would clearly be the only choice which fits the question.\n7. Doorknobs and doorways are both part of doors. Hence, any object near the doorknob would be close to the doorway and vice versa or in other words, within the doorway.\n8. So, D: doorknobs matches the question asked.\n9.

D: the trash can 5. E: my neighbor's house\nRationales: The solution to this question is C: the school. Let us break down the structure of the question:\n\n- There is a reference to a pile of garbage. So, the garbage has to be in some sort of a pile.\n- Since 'garbage' is an adjective here, we cannot say 'garbage is' (like 'The garbage can'), we can only say 'This is a pile of...' like 'This is a piled garbage'.\n- Therefore, garbage (without specifying the can) should be paired with 'piled' or 'pile of'\n- Looking at the options, we see the following:\n\n- A: The garbage can is not 'piled'. Therefore, A can be eliminated, leaving us with choice B:'my house'.\n- Similarly, 'the school' is not piled, making it not a possible answer. Next, we need to eliminate C.\n- The next option D 'The trash can' looks like a good choice, but we need to check if 'trash can' has to be capitalised (i.e. whether 'The' is right in position).", "answer": " 6400"}

Choices: 500 mm is bigger than 25 mm, but is 25 is bigger than 001 mm or is 001 mm bigger than 25.\nRationales: If 500 mm was bigger than 25mm, then 001 mm would naturally be bigger than zero, and one would be bigger than 25, which would mean 25mm is bigger than 500 mm, which is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: 25 is bigger.\n\nInput: What is 5 inches in feet? Choices: 24 inches in feet, 24 feet in inches, 24 ft in inchs, 5 inches in feet, 5 inch in feet, 5 ft in inches\nRationales: \"5 inches\" is a much smaller number than \"5 feet\".

Choices: 1. A: car 2. B: bike 3. C: motorcycle 4. D: scooter 5. E: skateboard\nRationales: In order to find the least expensive option, we need to factor in the cost of both riding the bike in two locations as well as the cost of the various vehicles.\n\n1. First, we can eliminate option A: car, as 25 miles by car would be more expensive than the cost of bike rental.\n\n2. Options B: bike and C: motorcycle are both valid options, as they are the cheapest options.\n\n3. Option D: scooter requires a scooter rental or ownership, which is less desirable than riding a bike or motorcycle, especially since these are free rental options offered to visitors and tourists.\n\n4. Option E: skateboard is a skateboard rental or skateboard ownership, both of which are more expensive than the bike or motorcycle options.\n\n5. Therefore, we have B: bike and option C: motorcycle, which are the two least expensive options of the provided ones.\n\n6. We can also find out which is the cheaper option by comparing the cost of the bike rental and the motorcycle rental.\n\n7. For the motorcycle rental, we must factor in the license and training cost and the rental cost of the motorcycle.\n\n8.

The options that can't be chosen are A: sound, B: voice, C: visual, as sound is the general term covering all kinds of audio in a speaker. Voice and visual, however, can be heard and seen.\n2. We need to take into consideration a) direction. As per the question, we need to decide how difficult it is to listen to it. We can eliminate C: visual because we can only watch and see it.\n3. b) In a class, it's difficult to hear and see at the same time. So we need to choose between A: sound and B: voice.\n4.

We can eliminate option D: doorknobs as this makes the same assumption as a previous choice above.\n6.

The underlined \"was the girl's\" is the subject of the sentence, meaning it must be referring to the noun in the blank.\n4. Because nouns are either singular or plural, the noun in option 1 must also be singular.\n5. Option 5: Jasmine and 1: Alana both have plural forms, meaning, they are not the right answer.\n6.

Option E: doorways like to stickout (of their adjacent rooms) are not necessarily enclosing a contained area where we could be reaching to grab something.\n6. Option C is the only viable choice left because option C: open doors could refer to the movement of the door within the doorway or the movement of an opening doorway, both of which tend to be enclosing a part of a room that one could theoretically be reaching for.\n7. Since it is unlikely to be the 'outside' door to a room, the question is essentially asking, \"where would you grab something within a doorway?\" This is 'in' the doorway.\n8. So there's no point looking for a reference point that is outside of the door in question, such as an object in the direction of the doorway, or an object in a nearby, adjacent room. This narrows down our search to just the inside of the room that the doorway is leading into, which can be best represented by the choice E: doorway.\n9. Therefore the answer is E: doorway, and option E will be repeated in the conclusion.\nAnswer: E.

{"text": "inanimate object. The question is asking about grabbing a contained object, not an inanimate object.\n3. Moving on, it is unlikely that we'd grab an object contained in an opening door, since a doorway usually refers to the gaping space between two door panels, meaning we cannot grab anything through it.\n4. Therefore we can eliminate options B and D.\n5. Let's take a look at option C: control panel. Typically, doorways lead to a room where an electronic device is installed, such as a TV in a living room. However, control panels for such electronics are often located elsewhere. For example, panels for an electronic thermostat in a room are often located on the walls of the room, not in the doorway.\n6. So we can eliminate option C.\n7. So what's left is option E: doorway. The phrase \"controlled by\" can mean the same as \"contained by\" in this context.\n8. Thus, the doorway is a place where someone could be expected to pick up an object.

A: snakes B: gophers C: alligators D: spiders E: iguanas\nRationales: There are six options here and in an interview, they are not likely to give me extra time to figure out which animals don't belong to this list.\n\n1. For the first one to be a reptile, I will think about its physical characteristics. That is a cold-blooded vertebrate (backbones) animal, a creature that has feathers, scales, or a protective shell to protect their body.\n2. The second part is that animals with these characteristics must have their mouth at the anus.\n3. Out of all the ones listed here, a gopher looks like a non-reptile. It does not have an external covering to protect its skin and it does not have an anus-mouth relationship.\n4. The other animals that don\u2019t look like non-reptiles are iguanas and spiders because they have feathers on their skin. But they don't look cold-blooded or that they have no mouth and anus at the same place. So, these candidates are not reptiles, but the remaining four.\n5. The other three that don\u2019t meet the criteria are snakes, spiders, and alligators. The criteria given for reptiles are iguana, spider, snake and non-reptiles, they are alligators.\n6.

To answer the given question, we need to eliminate all options that do not reflect an 'activity' such as'read books' and'relax', since they do not refer to any specific activity that is performed by the man, but rather an idiom.\n3. For instance, reading a book and relaxing are both ways to pass the time. Such 'types of activity' may be a characteristic way to spend certain amounts of time, like'reading books to kill time or'relaxing to destress' or the man but they are not direct indicators of the activity the man engages in.\n4. Next, we need to determine if the choice being performed by the man is an 'activity' or a 'thing' or 'action'. \n5. To do this, we need to look at what the word 'doing' at the beginning of the phrase indicates. \n6. The key thing to remember is that 'doing' is related to an 'action' while the choices given here are not actions.\n7. For instance,'read books' and other such choices do not refer to a specific action but describe a type of activity, like reading or writing a speech.\n8.

You will never drink a lot at the gym which will happen when you are about to go to the gym, when you are at the gum, not during.\n3. You can never stretch at the gym because you are doing one before you begin your workouts and at the end of your workouts. Thus, it is only a matter of doing more stretching", "answer": " 20"}

Similarly, we can eliminate options B: control panel and C: open doors, as they are doors that can be opened, making it easier for the object to be grasped through the doorway. Also, it would make sense to reach for an object that is contained in the doorway through the doorway itself, especially if it is hard to reach through the door jams. It would be difficult to reach objects on a control panel through the doorway, as the door jams are the only way for you to reach it. So, option B: control panel can be eliminated\n4. Option E: doorway can be eliminated as well, because it doesn't really give us the option of grabbing the object through a doorway as option A and B do. In addition, the question simply stated \"grab an object\" without stipulating the position that the object would be held in for this particular question. Thus, the question implies that options A and B are viable choices.\n5. Therefore A and B are choices that we will consider for the final answer.\n6. Looking at the remaining two choices, it is likely that we will be asked to grab an object that has to do with the door or doorway. For example, we can grab a doorknob or an object within a doorway (a.k.a the \"contained object\").\n7. Thus, we can rule out option C, so the correct choice is answer A: \"grab an object contained by the doorway\".\nAnswer: A: grab an object contained by the open door\n\nInput: Where do the workers enter the building they work in? Choices:  H: outside and on the interior L: outside and inside H: on the outside and inside Q: inside on the inside M: from the inside\nRationales: If a worker enters a building through the door, it is generally necessary to go back out through the same door. This means that in some cases, they must enter the building from the outside. So, the correct answer must involve a worker entering the building from the outside as well as the inside. \n\nHence, the correct answer is C: outside and inside.\n\nThe answer is: \n\nInput: Where", "answer": " 200"}

We can eliminate option D: doorknobs because, while they are contained by a doorway, they aren't specifically objects that we reach for when within a doorway. \n6. Option E: doorway is a natural assumption because a doorway contains one or more doors (object D) but looking deeper reveals that a doorway as stated in the options also refers to part of a building that contains the doorways. \n7. We can't say that the building itself is contained by a door because there is no need to reach out when the building is right in front of us. \n8. Option A: grab an object contained by doorway should be the answer.\nAnswer: A; grab an object contained by the doorway\n\nInput: I know that if you want a job opportunity, what must you prepare?

I know the answer to this question if I understand what the words \"you\" and \"to\" mean.\n2. I know the answer if I think about what the words \"are\" and \"must\" mean.\n3. The question is asking about some action that the reader must take if they want a job opportunity.\n4. The key to this question is the key in almost all similar questions - the action that the reader must perform is preparing.\n5. This involves making sure they are dressed properly, preparing for an interview, getting their resume out, being available for a phone call, and being able to pay for the job.\n6. Option A: make sure you are dressed... is not a key action to take. Option C: get a resume... does not work as a choice because it is a product a person prepares.\n7.

Option A might sound like it makes sense, but the key to answering this question is to look at \"control panel,\" which doesn't suggest controlling the door or moving it. It does not answer the question. \n5. Now, option C, opening doors, could actually help us 'grab' an object by the doorway. This option can be eliminated. \n6. Option D, doorknob. has a similar logic to opening doors, in that a doorknob is something we can use to open a door by grabbing it and this helps us grab the object contained by a door. \n7.

G.\nRationales:\n\n1. 'The pebble dropped in a bucket created which of these motions?'\n2. The question tells us that there are 7 possibilities and asks for which one is true.\n3. Pebbles are heavy, hence they fall to the bottom of the bucket.\n4. Thus, option \"E: the buckets contents are moved as a result' is the right one.\n5. In fact, \"D: the pebble stops moving because of friction\", is also correct.

Control panels have many purposes, such as for managing a home's security system, appliances, or entertainment devices.\n4. But they are not typically used to grab or hold something. As a result, option B can be eliminated. \n5. We can eliminate option C, which refers to door knobs, as these are the components of actual doors and not doorways, which are typically larger structures.\n6. Option D, which refers to doors and the doorway itself, would both capture the object sought, making the phrase \"contained by a doorway\" redundant.\n7. Option E is also appropriate, as doorways are locations where we often enter or leave a building.\n8. Therefore the answer must be D: doorway.\nAnswer: D : doorway\n\nInput: Who would take a small box from a room that was locked? Choices: 1. A: thief B: detective C: detective detective D: scientist E: thief scientist F: scientist\nRationales: The question asks who would take a small box out of a room that was locked.\n1. One way to think about this is, if one was a detective, we could assume that they may take some sort of evidence from a locked room. However, it's not quite possible to say this without context.\n2. A detective is, after all, a human. Given this, we can eliminate option A: thief. \n3. Option B: Detective indicates a human, so we can eliminate it too.\n4. Now, for option C: Detective Detective, this sounds strange because the description of the action implies it was a detective that was in a room. How could they take something from themselves? \n5. If we try to imagine it as a fictional scene in a movie, a detective talking to himself, then that would make it even stranger.\n6. Furthermore, the Detective detective, noting the double Detective can be interpreted as'scientist' or 'thief'.\n7. Therefore, it's not logical for option D to hold a real answer.\n8.

In option C: opening doors, the \"doorway\" (which is also an option) is referred to as \"doors\" in the sentence, so we can eliminate that option.\n6. This leaves us with two remaining options: B: control panel and D: doorknobs, where both options indicate a point from where we can grab the object inside the doorway. Choice B indicates a control panel, which is a flat surface and not a doorknob which is a rounded object.\n7.

Choices: \nA: someone is unemployed B: someone owns a lot of things C: someone does not have a car\nRationales:\n1. First, we recognize that all of the given choices are related to the idea of \"someone's employment status\".\n2. To determine option A: being unemployed is the most unreasonal, we need to rule out option B: someone owns many things, since it is more likely that someone without a job could not afford to own a large number of things.\n3. We then eliminate option C: does not have a car, since it is the least likely, and the most unreasonable choice.\n4. This leaves us with the option A: someone is unemploped.

{"text": "object that does not typically fit within a doorway.\n3. Option D: doorknobs, while useful objects, are not typically placed inside a doorway. Also, they are usually not grabbed but used to open the door.\n4. Option E: doorway has the term \"way\" in it which implies that it has a shape or location, and doesn't seem to be applicable to the question.\n5. Now, this leaves us with the remaining choices (B, C, D).\n6. Option C is also a doorway so it can't be the answer.\n7. We have narrowed it down to either option B or E which both refer to the area where a door is located, but if they are both acceptable to answer, we can go back to the term 'contain'. The phrase 'contain the door' refers to the door opening onto a larger room. Therefore, the location or direction of a door is not where an object is contained within. However, if the room has the door and object are contained by the door, then the object is not contained by the door.\n8. So, option D: doorway does not answer the question.\n9. Now we can eliminate all the choices except option B: control panel. A control panel commonly has switches and buttons that operate doors, hence the term 'control'.\n10. We can also note that option B does not say 'contain' the door but simply mentions the doorway.

Choices: B: themselves C: themselves D: others E: others\nRationales: The question asks which the baby is learning to speak like.\n1. The baby is learning to speak \"like a person who has a voice\". As we can infer, a \"voice\" is something that people have when they are able to communicate through speech and sound.\n2. The baby is learning \"to speak\", meaning it probably already has the ability to do so, and is not just learning the act of verbal communication.\n3. Therefore the baby is learning how to speak \"like a speaker\" or \"like a talker\", implying that it already spoke and understood simple speech.\n4. Option C: \"themselves\" seems suitable, so we can eliminate B: \"they themselves\".\n5. Since the baby has the ability to speak, and is learning how to speak well, option C: \"themselve\" must imply the ability to speak in general.\n6. Therefore the baby is already able to speak.\n7. Similarly, option D: \"others\" is redundant. It just implies that the baby is learning to talk. It does not give any new information on the nature of the knowledge acquired so we can eliminate option D: \"otherness\".\n8. Finally, we can answer the question by choosing the option E: \"others\", as in the process of knowing how to speak one learns to speak to others.\nAnswer: E - others\n\nInput: Which of the following are items typically found in a garage?

We can eliminate option B: control panel, as doorways are not in control panels.\n4. We can eliminate option C: opening doors, as doors generally provide an opening, not an object.\n5. Eliminating the remaining options, we can conclude that doorways and objects contained in doorways often share the same name because they are often found together, in a way that implies they are within the same context or relationship. Thus, we can safely place the object of our focus within that relationship and eliminate option D: doorknobs, E: doorways. \n6.

Choices:  S: a dog A: A dog\nS: B: Dog C: Dog\nS: D: E: Dog\nRationales: An instruction that uses an incorrect word or phrase in a sentence will often have a wrong answer choice.\nThis example is asking for the meaning of the sentence, \"A dog chases a cat\". This sentence contains a subject, and an object, and describes the action of \"chasing\".\n1. We should read the entire question before looking at the prompt to make sure it makes sense.\n2. The question isn't a complete sentence as it is missing something. \"what is the meaning of a...?\" is the beginning of a sentence, and is missing an ending.\n3. In a real world situation, a question like this would likely come before a question that asks why a specific answer is the correct choice.\n4. Including answers as part of the sentence and the prompt makes a lot of sense in logic. Answer prompts are often questions where multiple answers are given to help us understand what is meant.\n5.

In the other option choices, however, there are no objects \"contained\" by a doorway. Instead, those objects are contained, that is contained by, the room the doorway itself is part of, so options E: doorway and B: doorway should be eliminated.\n5. This is because there are two things that doorway refers to, the door that opens, and the walls and floors around that door that make it a \"doorway\". \n6. As we've eliminated both \"door\" and \"doorway\" from the list of objects to be contained, that leaves us with option D: doorknobs. \n7. The last option D: doorknoobs is the appropriate choice because it is the only choice involving \"door\" that is, and is not, contained by a doorway at the same time.\n8.

If the driver drove along that road to the right, what direction was the vehicle traveling in? Choices: \nA: forward\nB: backward\nC: left\nD: down\nE: up\nRationales:\n1. First, we need to identify the action that the driver performed, which was traveling on a winding road, as indicated by use of the term \"winding road\".\n2. This indicates that the driver's direction was moving in a direction that was winding through the road's bends rather than taking the straightest path through it.\n3. In other words, the road's turns had an overall direction.\n4. If the driver did not travel against the overall direction of the winding in a winding road, then they would have traveled toward that overall direction.\n5. Thus the vehicle traveled in the same direction as the overall winding of the road. \n6. If the driver was traveling in that direction, then they were going forward.\n7.

Given that the options include the baseball field, baseball bat, pitch, and team members, the answer should be a response that involves a bat and the direction of hitting the ball. \n3. This eliminates options C (bat) and D (team) because they do not specify the direction being used for hitting the ball.\n4. The remaining options A (field) and B (p", "answer": " 730"}

Next we can eliminate option B: control panel, as the doorway is a means to enter or exit a room, not access a control panel.\n4. Now looking at the remaining choices C: opening doors, D: doorknobs, E: doorways, we need to determine which answer would best answer the question.\n5. Option D: doors indicates objects which you can only grab if you are inside the room, and cannot be outside.\n6. Option B: door panel also suggests objects that would be inside the doorway, so they can only be grabbed if you are already inside.\n7. However, option E: doorway indicates objects that are outside the doorway from a point of view of a person who is not already inside the room (which excludes all the other options).\n8. Option C: Doors are the only option left which indicates a physical object that can be inside or outside the given space. \n9. This places the object within the doorway in the context of a person who is already inside the room (from a point of view of someone outside the room), since the question is asking about an object that is contained within the doorway. \n10.

We can eliminate this option and go to the last one option E: doors. This does not specify the type of door, and the kind of door being asked differs immensely from a normal door.\n6.

Choices:  A. chicken fox chased B. pig fox chased C. bone rope pig E. dog fox chased D. footsteps chased E. chicken followed the fox.\nRationales:\n1. We start by eliminating the option \"A. chicken fox rope chased\". This statement cannot be formed.\n2. Similarly, we cannot form option \"B. pig fox followed chased bone\". There is nothing that follows the fox in this situation, so we can eliminate this.\n3. In option \"D. footsteps followed chase chicken\". The \"chicken\" is already followed the \"footsteps\", we cannot form a compound sentence in which chicken is then followed by footsteps. Thus, we eliminate it.\n4. As the given options have been eliminated, the correct answer is \"E. dog fox chase chicken\".\nAnswer: E. dog fox the fox chased the chicken\n\n### Instructions:\n\nYou will be given a scenario.

Looking back at the phrase \"grab an object,\" this suggests some kind of action that we can immediately put into two categories\u2014using the hand or an instrument.\n6. Option B uses the phrase \"grab the doorway.\" While there may be instances where we would physically grab the structure that contains the door and thus, the doorway, this isn't what the question is asking about.\n7. Similarly, option D uses the phrase \"grabbing the handles of the door.\" Again, this is not what the question asks about.\n8.

Choices: A: the bluebook B: no one knows C: a large pencil D: a small pencil E: from memory\nRationales: First, we need to determine the intended meaning of the word 'invent' in this context. From the dictionary, we can see that invent (v.) means to develop (a product, method or idea) independently.\n1. Considering this definition, it's reasonable to assume that option A: the bluebook could refer to some kind of book that outlines how to construct an airplane. That's why option A: the blue book is incorrect. 2. Next, let's look at option C: a large pnceI. This choice cannot be the answer since it doesn't refer to how the inventor developed the airplane but rather it refers to the length of the pencil of the inventor.\n3. So what we're left with are D: a small pnceI and E: from memory. 4. The phrase 'from memory alone' does indeed suggest that the inventor came up with the concept", "answer": " 700"}
{"text": "electronic device and not physical or tangible.\n3.

Moving to options C and D: options C and D both involve actions that don't entail direct physical contact with the object. Option C: opening doors opens a door while option D: doorknobs are used for opening doors, both of which suggest that the question involves actions to be performed only when in contact with a door.\n5. Now, in the doorway, is there an object we can use to actually grab?\n6. The only possible answer is E: doorway, as it simply refers to the area enclosed by the door. This is the only option of the available choices that we can actually use to perform this action: grabbing the object.\n7.

Choices:  - A: the Olympics - B: bobsleighs - C: snowboarding - D: curling - E: cross country skiing\nRationales: One way to attack these questions is to look for a \"key\". This is usually a clue that will lead you to the correct answer. In this case, we can look at the options and see that several involve \"sports\". A sport is an activity that involves physical challenges such as strength, skill or speed.\n\n1. The options that involve \"sports\" are A: the Olympics, B: bobsleughs, C: snowboarding, and D: curling. This eliminates E: cross country skiiing, as it's not a \"sport\" (although it is very physically challenging!).\n2. Now, of all the options that involve \"sport\", we must figure out the one that is most likely to involve \"balance\".\n3. One option that has both of these is bobsleighs. When participating in a bobsleigh race, the competitor must maintain balance. Therefore, bobsleighs is the answer to this question.

{"text": "object that is not typically inside the doorway.\n3. The key here is that the object is contained by a door, so it is a closed space.\n4. Option D: doorknobs is a potential answer, as this would be an object that is contained within a door.\n5. However, option D: doorknobbels does not make sense when examined closer. A doorknob is not a collection of knobs; it is simply and object used to open a door.\n6. Option C: opening doors makes more sense since an opening door could contain various objects.\n7. Option E: doorways is not an object in and of itself, nor does it imply a contained space like the other options.\n8. We can eliminate C: opening doors, because this is not a containable object. In contrast, the remainder of the options are all containable, and a typical way to access objects inside a doorway is with your hands.\n9. Thus D: doorknolls can be eliminated. That leaves E: doorway. Therefore, the answer would be option E.\nAnswer: E. Doorway\n\nInput: How would you describe a room in detail? Choices: . A: small B: large C: square D: circular E: square shaped\nRationales: The question asks about the use of \"describe\". Therefore, it is expected that the answer should focus on the act of describing a room in detail.\n\n1. One of the possible ways to do this would be to use nouns that correspond to different geometrical shapes.\n2. So the logical question to ask is, should we use a noun that implies a room that has a rectangular shape (such as \"large\"), or a room that is circular or square (such as \"square\", \"round\", \"elliptical\", \"circular\", or \"square-shaped\").\n3. All of the given choices have a meaning that is aligned with the correct noun. \n4. The choices with a square shape (Option B and C) and circular shape (Option E) all have meanings that can be used to describe the shape of a room.\n5. Option A: \"Small\" is a relative term, it does not tell us anything about the geometrical shape of a room, so we eliminate that option. \n6. The remaining options all", "answer": " 90"}

Choices:  a: a sink b: a stove c: a countertop d: a faucet e: a refrigerator\nRationales:\nHere I want to answer to the question in which of the following choices can you find the kitchen?\n\nI've found the following explanation useful:\n\nIn the choices above, the correct one is a sink, or simply the sink or wash basin, usually fixed to the kitchen countertop /table and used for hand washing.\n\n\nA sink is a basin filled with water, used for washing dishes, clothes, hands, or food preparation tasks. The sink is connected to water sources that are plumbed into one or more taps at the lower side of the basin.\n\nSome types of sinks have a drain, a tap and perhaps also a faucet in the middle of the sink, allowing soap to be added to the water flow, or for special purposes, such as washing hair, for which there should be a strong jet flow.\nA sink is also known in modern kitchens as a wash basin and as a laundry basin, or simply, sink.\n\n\nA faucet is a valve control for a flow of water, generally controlled by a knob. Faucets are controlled by turning the handle, which causes the valve (or valves) inside the mechanism to open and close, allowing water to flow out, or to cease to flow. While simple mixer taps use a single-hole mixer unit, basin mixers typically have two holes through the sink or basin to allow hot and cold water to come into separate sections of the mixer unit", "answer": " 2000"}

Then we are left with the following options to choose from: D: doorknobs and E: D: doorway.\n6. The question says an object is contained within a doorway, so an option related to the doorway itself is the most logical option.\n7.

Choices: A: carnivorous B: non-aggressive C: domestic D: omnivorous E: territorial\nRationales: This question presents a contrast between 2 species and asks for which one is different from the other.\n1. We can eliminate option B: non-agressive because the question doesn't mention anything about the aggressiveness or non-aggressiveness of either the cat or the dog.\n2. Similarly, option C: domestic doesn't match with the description either. Neither the cat nor the dog are domestic, hence we can rule it out.\n3. Option D: omnivores seems to be a good choice. Omnivore is an adjective that means having the ability to eat any kind of food. Hence, we can say that both the cat and the dog can eat anything that they wish to eat.\n4. But, among the given options only one of them can not be omnivorous, and it is option A: carnivores because carnivore is the opposite of omnivore. It refers to individuals who eat only meat. This is an acceptable answer as cat is certainly not a carnivore. On the other hand, dog can be either carnivorous or omnivorous.\n5. In order to find the correct option we have to analyze each one of the options individually. Option E: territorial fits with cat perfectly.

Moving on to the remaining four options, we can eliminate options C: above and E: in front because they are not places in which a person can be found.\n3. Further elimination rules that the object cannot be in a position B: around because any place a person is in is necessarily not a position.\n4. A person's place is most likely to be inside or beneath. However since the options are all given by place, it could mean that it is possible for a person's place to be above or in front. So there is a chance it can be C: above, option D: beneath, or option E: in front. \n5. Choices D: beneath and option E: In front both directly describe an object.\n6.

Eliminate option D as \"doorknob\" is an object that could potentially be contained by a doorway or just outside it. \n6. The remaining option is E: doorway. Doorways, by definition, contain objects. \n7.

Choices:  A) money B) friends and family C) good shopping D) clothes E) fashion industry\nRationales:\n\n1. Here is step-by-step analysis. Let's start with reasoning steps.\n2. Step 1:  We start by stating the question, which is \"One of the biggest fears, what?\"\n3. The answer to this question will be the subject of the sentence, which is \"One\" in option A: money. But that answer doesn't match the key words in the question.\n4. Reasoning on what the key words in the set are and where they appear in the sentence (steps 1-3: question, steps 4-12), one of the biggest fears could be \"without\" the word \"money\". In reasoning steps 5 and 8, they say a person lacks something and without something, he/she is scared to go somewhere which is what they are asking about.\n5. The only thing that a person can be scared or worried about is lacking the ability to do something (steps 9 and 11) and in this case, it is not having money (step 13).

Option D, doorknob is not mentioned in the given options, if we consider these options together, doorknob does not make any sense as it could be referring to an object that is contained anywhere within the doorway or could even be within the door itself since it has an opening.\n8. Therefore the only correct option for the question is option B: control panel.\nAnswer: B. \"Control panel\" appears in all the correct options, but \"doorknob\" does not appear in any of the correct options.\n\nInput: How do I get something that I don't have in the bank? Choices: 1. A: make an appointment 2. B: invest 3. C: sell something 4. D: make a donation 5. E: wait in line\nRationales: There are multiple methods to obtain a bank account once it has been lost so the best method would be one method that could help obtain an account while maintaining a low probability and having a short wait time.\n1. The first step is to eliminate the option that is not correct. Making an appointment does not help obtain a bank account since the appointment is made with bank employees and this is not the action to obtain a bank account.\n2. We could eliminate invest because it does not mention the bank and does not necessarily help obtain a bank account, though it could help obtain an extra bank account, but this is not the intent of the question.\n3. This makes room for eliminations. Selling something could help someone obtaining an extra bank account by selling off property that they already have to fund the account, but since the question asks for a lost bank account this method should be eliminated.\n4. This is the next round of eliminations. Donating money to an unknown person and asking for a bank account is certainly", "answer": " 100"}

Finally, we have four viable answer options: E: doorway, C: opening doors, D: door frame, and B: the door itself.\n6. Of these four options, E: doorway doesn't directly mean that the object is contained by it. However, we know the option to be an acceptable choice.\n7.

We start eliminating options by assuming that the choice cannot be a pencil. \n2. Pencils contain graphite or lead, or a wooden body, and not a specifically designed element that is unique to pencils.\n3. Now, we know that PEN and PENNY are not acceptable options.\n\n4. S: pencil is not an available option either.\n5. So, we have the remaining choices TR and R, which are abbreviations that refer to two different objects.\n6.

They are defined by the size of the doorway itself, which restrains space in the adjacent room. \n5.

Because the option that is correct is \"A: outside the door\", it means that everything else must be incorrect (they must be distracters).\n2. In deductive reasoning, the choice that is incorrect must be logically wrong based on the other choices.\n3. This means that they must have a logical error.\n4.

We need to understand if an adjective is being used or a clause. An adjective is a descriptor and a clause is a group of words that express a complete thought. \n\nIf an adjective is being asked, we should look for a word that best describes the state of the dog.

Since it explicitly says dog, we don't need to figure out what he is, \"he's a dog\" because active dogs do not play with balls.\nConsider the meaning. In this case, we cannot just apply \"the dog is not an active dog\" because we cannot assume that the ball represents 1/1 dog who is 100% not an active dog, that would be contradictory.

Option B: control panel, is contained by a door but is not grabbed.\n6. Finally, option E: doorway, is the correct answer as it can be considered as a door but specifically a doorway refers to the overall door structure that contains the door and other elements such as doorknobs and frames. The object cannot be found in a door or a frame and an object can typically only be found within the space that a doorway is intended to contain.

Choices: \nA: moisture B: ripeness C: nutrients D: sugar E: wind\nRationales:\n1. We know that the choice in this question is to select \"what keeps some fruits jucy, such as oranges.\" It tells us that we have to choose what will keep these fruits \"jucy,\" meaning that there must exist some reason that prevents these fruits from losing their juicy texture.\n2. We initially cross out choices \"A: moisture\" and \"D: sugar\", as they are not relevant answers and thus not options in the given question. As it is asking us specifically to explain what keeps fruit like oranges juicy, we need to find something relevant to oranges. Sweeteners like sugar are not likely to affect oranges but will affect fruit such as grapes.\n3. If we assume that the fruits mentioned, \"oranges\" have a sweet flavor, we can eliminate choices \"B: ripeness\" and \"C: nutrients\". As oranges will likely continue to have a sweet flavor even if they are not super juicy, they must still have the nutrients present in the fruit that have not caused it to become less juicy.\n4.

We can eliminate C: opening doors, as \"opening\" is generally associated with the act of changing the state of the door from closed to open. Therefore, this would not be a contained object or place.\n5.

Choices:  a) color choice b) personality c) horse blanket d) saddle blanket e) red blanket\nRationales: Here we need to interpret what the words \"chestnut colored blanket\" suggest. First, it implies that horse has a specific kind of blanket and that is that it is chestnut colored. However, the phrase \"chestnut colored\" is not specific enough about the blanket's nature. In the list of answers, option a) color choice explicitly states the particular color - chestnut. Hence, it indicates that the horse has a specifically colored blanket that is chestnut. Of the remaining answers, only option b) personality refers to a characteristic of the horse, which is not the case here. Option c) horse blanket and d) saddle blankets do not offer an answer to the question in terms of the color. This leaves only e) red blanket from the choices.

Option D: doorknobs, refers to a part of the door mechanism that, typically, resists movement in order to not allow people to just open it in an unauthorized manner.\n6.

In golf, the player aims to get the ball into the hole or into as close to the hole as possible.\n2. In the question, we need to choose one word to describe the destination of a putt. \n3.

Since an opening door is an object, it cannot be contained by a doorway, hence B & C are eliminated. Doors are also moving objects, in many circumstances, and if the object is contained by a door, it will be stationary, not moving.\n4. Option D: doorknobs refers to a feature of a door that is used to open or close the entire door. It is not the feature by which an object is or could be contained.\n5. Hence, the object we are being asked to grab is contained by option E: doorways instead, and it is this option which is the correct answer.\nAnswer:  E: doorways.\n\nInput: Where could a person store all their food?

Likewise, option B: control panel, is another incorrect choice, as it is a doorway feature rather than something contained by the doorway as asked for.\n4. Next, we need to determine if option C: opening doors is relevant to the question. It is not. Instead, we should eliminate it because another part of the sentence - \"contained by a doorway\" - indicates that the object is already trapped in the doorway. Opening the door means they become free to leave.\n5. We're left with options D: doorknobs and E: doorway.\n6. While a doorknob is something contained by a doorway, the nature of the question does not mention that the answer could be a doorknob. The question is very particular about the object being contained by the doorway. So, the answer should be E: doorway. We can say that the object would be available in the doorway of choice.\nAnswer: E.Doorway\n\nInput: What are the characteristics of the person who lives near a gorilla? Choices: 1. A: noisy 2. B: animal lover 3. C: noisy as a gorilla 4. D: gorilla lover 5. E: noisy like a gorilla\nRationales:  1. The question is describing the characteristics of a person who lives 'near' a gorilla. So, we will need to figure out which of the given options most closely fit the description.\n2. 'Noisy as a gorillas' can be eliminated as the option because we don't know if the person living near the gorilla is noisy or not, but the gorilla already is.\n3. 'Gorilla lover' could be a reasonable answer if the person living near a gorilla was an animal lover. But, in the sentence it is said that the person 'lives near a gorilla', so we can't use this option to provide the characteristic.\n4. Likewise, 'animal lover' cannot be the answer as well, as the other options have it in their description, but we don't know for sure.\n5. Option D: 'noisy", "answer": " 80"}

Option C: doors can be either open or closed. \n4. However, if there are  open doors, we still cannot grab an object as it would leave the doorway.\n5. In the case that the door is closed, though, we could grab something, but this isn't the point of the question.\n6. Therefore the only suitable options from the given choices are E: doorway (as it is the part of the doorway that contains an object) and D: doorknobs.\n7. But, the question does not specify which doorknob or door. This is important because it gives us only the part of the door that we can grasp and  grab; we cannot grab onto an entire door.\n8. Therefore we can only grab an object contained in front of a door, and this door need not be fully open or closed. It could be partially open or partially closed, or it could be completely open or completely closed.\n9. So we can only select the answer option that covers the most possible scenarios. Among the given answers, D: doorknabs covers all possibilities to a certain extent as the opening where a doorknob is located is the area between the closed door and the door frame. The other option E: doorway is only helpful if the door is open and the frame of the door is not the actual edge of the door (that is, if the door has something in-between the frame and the door itself).\n10.

Option D: Doorknob refers to the object we grab when we open the door. Therefore, it's an alternative choice than the actual answer, which is doorway.\n6. We can confirm this when we further eliminate option E: Doorway. Option E refers to the fact that we open a door which is contained by a door frame, hence the doorway is the option we should choose.\n7.

From the given options, option B: control panel suggests a more complicated environment.\n5. Furthermore, the term \"control panel\" is not typically used in common conversation.\n6. Therefore we can eliminate option B: control panel.\n7. Similarly we can also eliminate option C: opening doors. The description of the doorway doesn't really describe any special kind of doorway, so the term \"opening doors\" could just be referring to any type of doorway. \n8. If the question really was about a specific kind of doorway, then the appropriate answer would be the one that fits the criteria. \n9. But since the term \"opening door\" doesn't really fit the given description, we can eliminate that option.\n9. For the same reason, option D: doorknobs also doesn't fit the description. The term doesn't refer to an object that is contained within \"a doorway\". \n10. Now only option E: doorway is consistent with the given description. Since the doorway contains the object, one would presumably grab it from within the doorway.\n11.

Therefore, option E: doorway should be the answer.\nAnswer: A doorway\n\nInput: What does it mean to be on the inside of a place? Choices: 1. being in front of a place 2. entering a room 3. to be in an area of a place 4. being at a place without visiting it 5. to be at a place, not a building\nRationales:\n\n1. To understand the meaning of being on the inside of a room, we first need to know what it means to be on the outside of a place.\n2. Well, 'outside' is the other side of a place, so being on the inside of something means the opposite of being on the outside. \n3. Another way to say it is to say \"inside a place\" is \"on the inside of a place\". You can be on the inside of anywhere, be it a house, a restaurant, a planet.\n4. A person does not have to visit a place in order to be on the inside", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": "object that is typically contained inside a doorway.\n3. Next, option D: doorknobs, is excluded for the simple reason that doorknobs do not contain objects. They are used to open the door, not contain objects inside the door.\n4. Similarly, option E: door ways, is excluded. \"Doorway\" refers to the structure itself, not the space that is contained inside the doorway.\n5. Similarly, option C: panels, refers to the components of a doorway, not the space that the doorway contains.\n6. This leaves us with two options, B: control panel and C: opening doors.\n7. Now, a control panel, like a car control panel, is not contained by a doorway, and therefore cannot be grabbed.\n8. Option C: opening doors, however, may include many different doors. All of these doors may have handles that we can grab. So, this is the correct answer.\n9. Hence, the correct answer is C: opening doors.", "answer": " 160"}

Moving on to options B: control panel, D: doorknobs and E: doorways, these would more likely be found located outside of the door, as they control movement of the door. \n4.

Therefore the correct answer is B: control panel. The control panel is located on the outside of the doorway, and the user would be able to grasp it without triggering any unwanted door opening activity.\nAnswer: B. control panel\n\nInput: Where is a good place to get a cup of coffee and a snack when it's a rainy day? Choices: 1: gas station 2: grocery store 3: donut shop 4: coffee shop 5: bakery 6: movie theatre\nRationales: The question asks where a good place to get hot coffee and snacks when the weather is rainy.\n7. Among the given options, A: gas station B: grocery store C: donut shop D: donut shop E: movie theatre, donut shops do not appear to be a logical choice, as hot coffee or snacks would not be typical products sold in a donut shop.\n8. Option A: gas station. A gas station could potentially sell hot coffee and snacks, but since it's a rain day, you won't find a lot of foot traffic.\n9.Option B: grocery stores. Grocery stores typically sell items like coffee and snacks, and they are likely to be busy on a rainy day as people might need to purchase items before bad weather arrives. \n10. Option C: donut shop. While donut shops may sell hot coffee and snack options like muffins, these items are unlikely to be the primary focus of a donut shop, so they would not be a good option for this scenario. \n11. Option D: donut shop. A donut shop could potentially sell hot coffee or snacks, but since its a rainy day, you won' t find a lot of foot traffi. \n12. Option E:", "answer": " 65"}
{"text": "object that may be located in a room, but can't be considered contained by a doorway or a doorway itself.\n3. Moving to option C: opening doors, we can now discard this option since openings to rooms are not typically closed with a door, or a doorway.\n4. Option B: control panel is incorrect as well because a control panel is used on devices to operate or control them.\n5. The phrases \"doorway\" and \"control panel\" do not combine to create a sense of motion or direction. A room or a doorway can open either inward or outward, but a control panel operates (and cannot be moved) without directionality.\n6. Next, we find an option that may offer the proper wording. This includes options A: television and E: doorway, as they share a relation to the location of the doorway. \n7. It will be hard to access the doorway or the object contained within it if the doorway were to be closed.\n8. So, the closest option would require the doorway not only to be unlocked, but also to be wide open which is E: doorway.\n9.

Choices: A: attending a job interview B: a wedding C: missing a friend D: attending college E: a doctor appointment\nRationales:  1. First, we'll look at the reason we couldn't attend the meeting. \n2. The phrase missing a friend is incorrect here, as the meeting was missed.\n3. The other 4 options contain verbs in their phrases, such as going to college, attending job interviews or a doctor appointment.\n4. But the reason for missing the meeting was not one of these, it was just what was listed in the choices, i.e., \"not attending a meeting\".\n5. So, the sentence must be A: not attending a meeting. \nAnswer: A: not attending meeting\n\nInput: In the office, what can you find that provides a comfortable seat?

Since the options are A,B,C,D,E, and D can't be the answer, if only D was the available choice then D would be the final answer.\n5. However, there are 5 options.\n6. So, the final possible answers are A,B, C and E.\n7. Then we have to ask, \"Which of these options isn't an office chair in the office?\"\n8.

Choices: 1 day 6 days 22 days 23 days 1 year\nRationales: First, we must consider the structure of the question. The phrasing states \"the moon takes to orbit the Earth\". 'Take' is a present form of the verb, which indicates that the event has already happened.\n7. 'Orbit' is a transitive verb that indicates action taken around the object. \n8. Therefore, we know that the question is asking for the duration of the orbits that the moon takes around the earth.\n9. We can eliminate option one since \"1 day\" doesn't match the number of orbits we're expecting. \n10. Among the remaining choices, the phrasing \"23 days\" is somewhat odd. Although \"days\" is a common word used to describe cycles of the earth and moon, it doesn't seem to fit the required answer of a time period based on the number of rotations of the earth. \n11. In addition, \"22 days\" indicates \"22 nights\" and \"13 months,\" neither of which are compatible with our question's desired format.\n12. The remaining choices indicate a cycle that completes once every \"24 hours,\" and \"12 months.\"\n13. Since the moon's orbit is related to its position in relation to earth, and 12 months of our \"24 hour cycles\" represent 364 days, we can deduce that the moon does not complete 12 orbits (12 month cycles) of the earth within a", "answer": " 325"}

Option D: doorknobs are typically held or grabbed on the front-side of a door, not in a doorway.\n5. Option E: doorway. \n6. A doorway refers to the frame that forms a transition between two separate surfaces of a door. \n7. The main function of a doorway is to enable or facilitate movement between rooms or surfaces, so it would not contain any objects that a person would want to grasp. \n8. For example, if we were to take an object from a hallway and place it on a door's doorframe itself, then we would be interacting with the doorway, but we would not be grabbing an object inside the doorway. So, by the definition of the question, doorways do not contain objects, while objects are contained within doorways.\n9. Therefore our answer is C: opening doors. Opening doors are the surfaces that provide the action to reach or remove objects from the doorway.\n10. While an opening door may contain an object in its frame, we would grab and take the object either from the doorway itself or from the opening of the door.\n11. So opening doors are our answer.\nAnswer: C: opening doors\n\nInput: Where can you usually see a bear with no bones?

Option D: doorknobs could hold an object in place if the object is held onto or underneath the doorknob, but they are not inside of a doorway.\n5. So, this leaves us with options B, D and E.\n6. The term doorway implies that the entire doorway is a container, indicating that we can't grab the object from outside of the doorway, and we cannot grab the object from somewhere along the door frame (with or without the opening).\n7. So, we can't grab objects from within the doorway either, meaning they must be inside the entire door itself. This means option E: the door.\n8.

But that does not provide the largest number.\n2. We know that the next number goes further away from the number you are trying to find the largest number of. If you are using the number zero as the first number in those in a list this would provide you with the largest number in the list. But you cannot find them all without using a smaller number as the first number.\n3. The first and last number would not work because they both could not be used to find that same number that you are trying to find in a number list.\n4. We know that the largest number of a list is always closer to the end of the number. By looking at the middle number this provides us with one of the larger numbers to a smaller one.

Next, we can eliminate option D: doorknobs, as the question specifically mentions \"object contained\", which the doorknob is not.\n4. That leaves us with remaining options B: control panel, C: opening doors, and E: doorway.\n5. There is a possibility that some items may be located behind doors. For instance, some electronic devices, such as a television or a computer, may be contained behind a door in a room.\n6. Similarly, some electrical control panels may have wires or electrical components concealed behind doors.\n7. Opening doors can also reveal objects, for example, opening the door of a closet may reveal various clothing items contained inside.\n8. So, option B: control panel, option C: opening doors, or option E: doorway would still be possible answers to this question.\n9. However, we can eliminate option E: doorway, as the question specifically indicates that the object being grabbed is contained behind the doorway and not just present behind it.\n10. Similarly, we can eliminate option C: opening doors as well, as it is not a definitive action of the question, nor does it refer to the specific mechanism of door opening.\n11. Finally, we can identify that option B: control panel is the only option that matches the question and is also a feasible location to place a control panel.\n12. Therefore, the answer to the given question would be the option B: control panel.\nAnswer: B. control panel\n\nInput: The group's new coach was looking to do a great job.

We can also eliminate option D: doorknobs, as there isn't one in the choice, and it wouldn't make much sense to grab it in the first place.\n4. Option B: control panel is eliminated since it is an object with wires and a variety of other components which cannot be grasped without handling the entire object.\n5. Option C: opening doors is a bit more tricky. We see that while there is a door in the choice, there is no doorway. This is because the door is open already and there isn't an opening in the wall to walk into. So it is eliminated as well.\n6. Therefore there are only three choices remaining with a door or a doorway: E: doorway, B: opening doors and C: door. \n7. The doorway is the most obvious and sensible choice. \n8. There would be nothing stopping you from reaching the door and grabbing it if it were inside a doorway.\n9.

E: when his head is taller than his body. \nRationales: Reasoning Steps used: 1. The first step in solving this question is to try to define what the word \"human\" means.\n2. The second step is to look at all the details in the picture, including the boy, his body and the background.\n3. We take away the choices that are not relevant to what we are looking for.\n4. The boy may not have learned to talk yet, but he is still learning other things, so we can eliminate A: When he can make their own choices and B: not yet. \n5. We see that the boy still doesn't have the full height of an adult human, so we eliminate C: When he learns. \n6. So the only choices that could explain what it means to be a \"human\" are D: Only when he can talk and E", "answer": " 375"}

Option D: doorknobs are not objects that are contained within the doorway. Doorknobs aren't objects that are contained by a doorway, only doorknobs themselves.\n6. Option E: a doorway would be the only logical option, since it would contain objects, and it would be the most fitting location for someone to grab an object.\n7. Overall, we understand that grabbing an object in this scenario from the doorway location is only possible by using the doorway location.\n8.

Option B: control panel, is something that would be found on a door and an object that we would like to grab.\n5. So this option is closer to the correct option than the previous options.\n6. However, in the image, we see that control panels are located inside rooms, and we are not concerned with objects that can be found inside rooms.\n7. Therefore we can eliminate option B: control panel.\n8. Now we are left with 3 options: C: opening doors, D: doorknobs and E: doorways.\n9. Opening doors would be an option, but they are not objects, nor are they contained by doorways. So we can eliminate this option.\n10.

Witches would not cause plants to wither. They can, however, put spells on them, which is the basis of certain popular legends.\n2. Snow storms are weather events that can sometimes cause freezing temperatures, potentially leading to ice damage to exposed plants and trees. So, C: Bad weather is probably what the question is driving at.\n3. There's a difference between rain and snow, but it's unlikely that an extreme storm would damage a tree only by raining on it.

First, let's understand the correct direction of pointing.\n3. It's up (either pointing up or with its face up). It's unlikely to mean you face up (towards the ground), so we can eliminate this choice.\n4. It's also unlikely to mean you point with your face towards the ground, which can lead us to the incorrect answer of down (face down).\n5. We can therefore conclude that the correct direction of pointing is up.\n6. The question then asks in which direction you point to indicate when you need to get or belong to something?\n7. The directions 'left', 'right', and 'up' should not mean that you turn your body in that direction.\n8. The directions can only refer to the direction of your eyes or where you're looking - like looking to the left or to the right.\n9. So, the directions would refer to the right and left of 'you', which is either the person or an object that needs to get or belong to the thing.\n10. And therefore the answer 'left' is incorrect.

Moving to options C: opening doors and D: doorknobs, both of these options could be considered to be a part of a doorway. \n5. However, opening doors, and doorknobs both refer to a mechanical part of the door, not the door itself.\n6. If the object was inside the door, one would naturally grab it as it is not contained by a doorway anymore.\n7. Therefore, option C: opening doors does not satisfy the requirement to be contained by a doorway and option D: doorknub is unnecessary, so we can eliminate the two options.\n8. We can then focus on the other two options: control panel and doorway. \n9. The phrase containing an object does not imply it is \"inside\" the object. For example, a container like a jar is not literally inside the object it contains, but still it contains the object inside it.\n10. In the given options, option C: control panel can be considered to have the object contained inside it since it has the television inside it. \n11. We can then focus our attention on doorway.

Choices:  A  a tree B  a branch C  a bug D  a branch on a tree E  the bird\nRationales: The question asks about the action of a car at night coming into direct contact with the object \"bird\".\n1. To understand what the car came into contact with, we can eliminate the \"branch\" and \"branch on a tree\" out of the choices.\n2. This is because \"brush\" and \"branch on the tree\" would be part of the \"tree\", which is not the thing that is struck or impacted by the car. \n3. Also, the tree, being the entirety of the thing to which the \"bird\" is \"affixed\", is not directly hit. So it does not directly relate to the collision between the car and the \"bird\".\n4. The options \"car\" and \"bird\" refer to the things directly involved in the collision, so they can't be immediately eliminated.\n5. The choice \"a large bird in the road\" itself shows that the bird was on or in the road, and not in the grassy area beside it.\n6.

Option D: doorknobs are often used as handles, but the question states that we are grabbing a contained object. Therefore, we eliminate D.\n4. Option E: the doorway itself is an enclosed space used to exit rooms or buildings and the question only asks about grabbing an object within the doorway. Thus, we eliminate option E.\n5.

As opposed to A: television, control panel refers to a device or set of parts used for controlling a process in a physical system or system of systems.\n7.

However, it is used to adverbs (e.g., really, quickly, quietly), which means to modify verbs. Also, the word is an adverb that means quickly or quickly (e.g., quickly, quickly).\nExplanation 4: The phrase \"tricky subject\", does not mean \"tricky subjects\", nor \"tricky object\" and so. However, the adjective \"tricky\" is linked with nouns, such as \"tricky problem\" and \"tricky situation\".

Choices: 1: kitchen. 2: bookcase. 3: table. 4: on the floor. 5: drawer.\nRationales: The first order of business is to deconstruct the phrase \"good place for storing papers\".\nIn this context, papers refers to both physical documents and digital files. We will not go into detail regarding other types of papers that may or may not be able to fit in with the scenario in question. We will simplify and look at the literal meaning of the two words\u2014good and place\u2014and see if there are any other options that could work.\nSo let's start with the second word, place. The place is the location where we are looking to store the papers in question. In order to find the place, we must first ask where the place is in order to find out which location we are looking to use.\nOne way to solve this question is to go through the possible items in the place:\n\n- kitchen\n- bookcase\n- table\n- on the floor\n- drawer\n\nIf we look through them individually, we can come to a common conclusion. In order to use the above-mentioned choices as an appropriate place for storing papers, these places may require a great deal of effort and resources to keep the papers safe. Using the papers as the first item in the place is not only a physical impossibility, but it would also require excessive work to maintain the papers in a single", "answer": " 13"}

Doorway may refer to only the door or it could describe an area outside of it. However, looking at the surrounding choices, we can eliminate option D: door, as it is an obvious choice to simply walk inside the doorway to grab the object.\n5. The remaining options, A: television, B: control panel, C: opening doors, and E: doorway are therefore the only acceptable options where an item could be contained.\n6. There are two options where objects are directly placed on or in front of a door, namely option C: opening doors and option E: doorway. \n7. However, the questions does not specifically refer to the door in options C: opening doors and E: doorway, it simply describes the act of walking into a doorway.\n8. Therefore we need to compare options C and E and determine where it would be more likely for an item to be placed (as in choice A: television). The items are either in front of the door in option C, or in- or attached to the door in option E.\n9. Since the door does not offer any clear advantages or disadvantages on whether items are placed in front of it or attached to it, we are not sure where an object would end up, as it could go either way.\n10. However, the fact that the objects (television and control panel) are placed outside of the doorway suggests that it would be more likely they were attached or contained in the door, and option E: door is the more suitable choice. \n11. So, the answer is choice E: doorway.\nAnswer: E.doorway\n\nInput: How might an inventor not have found anything to patent? Choices:  D: too many inventions E. no inventor F.

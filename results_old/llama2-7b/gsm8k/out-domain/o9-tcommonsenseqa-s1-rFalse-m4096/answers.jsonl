{"text": "For my response I will create a recursive method in order to achieve a solution for the puzzle. I will create three variables: riverWidth, boatLength, and boatDistance. To begin the problem solving process, I will give the variable riverWidth the value 3 feet. To establish the boatLength as a variable, I will declare its value equal to 2 feet. The boatDistance variable will need to be declared as a variable that can hold a value of at least 100. Next, in order to solve for the answer to the puzzle, I will determine the value of boatDistance.\n- To determine the value of boatLength, since it is required to have at least 2-feet of space between boats, I will subtract the boatLength from the riverWidth. Then, the riverWidth will be divided into third-portions by the boatLength. This will yield the number of boatLengths. Then, to account for any leftover space, I will subtract 1 from the number of boatLength. This will serve as a check to avoid any boats overlapping.\n\nThe process for solving this recursion will be as follows.\n- 2-feet \n- 1-feet \n - 200\n- 200\n+ 1\nNow I will declare a method that I will call \"recursive\"\n\n### Democratization of knowledge", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "John is very unfit and is training to do a push-up. He trains 5 days per week for them and starts by wall push-ups. He adds 1 rep each day and once he reaches 15 reps, he will train for low elevation push-up, then a high elevation, and finally a floor push up. How many weeks will it be before he gets to the floor push up?\n\nI answered question 5 by changing my answer to this:\nYou must first know your high elevation push-up (HE-PU) threshold.  Once you have this value, you use this formula `time = (60/HE-PU) * x * (x-1),` where you have `x` be the wall push-up (WP) total, in our example that is 50.\n\nIf you have 50 WPs and then start a 6 day weekly schedule, you can get to a HE-UP in 1 week.  Each week increase the number of WP by one week later and add 1 HE-PU to that week and you will always be making progress.\n\nI will use a 50 WP and I will use a week as a time frame.  Each week my `x` will be 50 the first week, but will increase weekly. Week 1 will have a HE-PU, but week 2 would have two, week 3 would have 3 HE-PU, and so on.\n\nI know the time before you arrive at a HE-UP based on that formula.\n\nWe'll start with `HE-PU = 60/` and then `HE-UP = (60/50),` since you get 100% of a rep, we take what is the `60/50` divide by `50` to get what is 50% HE-UP.  `60/550 / 50 = 1.08435....`   Now we change `60/51` to `1.08463027...` but we add one to that `1/.08463 = 11.66....`\n\nI will need to keep this rounding from continuing which is why I use the Euler\u2013Mascheroni formula to", "answer": " 9"}

If the two animals were initially adjacent to each other, it would take the cheetah 8 seconds longer to catch the gazelle. This is because the cheetah would have had to travel 0.56 miles to get past the gazelle instead of his normal 0.3 miles.\n\n### Input\nThe math problem is very hard, a little over my head.  Also the two animals are initially adjacent to each other.  How can the cheetah be traveling 0.56miles to get past the gazille if the two animals are adjacent to each other?\n\n### Solution\n\nThe two animals are not adjacent to each other.\n\nThe cheetah is traveling up to a top speed of 96 fps while the gazelle is traveling at a top speed of only 18 fps.  Because the gazelle is significantly slower, it's top speed will still be faster than the cheetah for the duration of the competition between the animals, even if it were to slow down.\n\nThe cheeter travels for 0.56 mile at a speed of 90fps, which would cover the distance from 0.56mi to 0.85 miles.\n\nThe animals start out next to each other and the cheetah is able to chase down the gazelle because the cheetah is travel at 6 times the speed of the gazelle while their top speeds are the same.

{"text": "$200\n---\nA number can be thought of as a **sequence** of digits and as a **position** in a list. The digits forming the number are called its *value*.\n\n```\n39\n```\n\nAs an example, let's convert the following number:\n\n```\n598\n```\n\nTo a sequence:\n\n```\n(9)(5)(8)\n```\n\nThe **sequence** of digits (`5 9 8` in this case) is known as the base 10 **representation** of the number. To obtain the decimal representation, divide the base 10 representation by 10, obtaining (5 9 8) / 10 = (59/10) / 10 or 59/100 = 5 / 10.\n\n```\n  5\n```\n\nThe above is the decimal representation of the number 598. A number that is represented as a sum of a sequence can be said to be a **sequence** of the original number. The number of 598 can be partitioned into five sequences as follows: (5)(5)(8), (9)(5)(8), 5(5)(8), 9(5)(8), and 5(8).\n\nIf we are converting 39 into a sequence, we use 9 as our *base*. In general, *representation* of a number can be done in base 2, base 16, base 10 or other bases available. If you divide 39 by the base then the result is remainder. If the remainder has another base as its representation then you have *represented* its value in the next power of the base where this base was used.\n\nLet's see how we can determine the value of 39 expressed in another base.\n\n```\n   39\n  2  9\n 2  1  9\n```\n\nThe representation 2 9 is in base 16. But, we want 39 in base 16 since the base of representation is 2. We can get 39's base twelve representation by converting 2 times 2 to 16 then 1 to 10, 7 to 8, and 9 to 0 in the remainder.

Also I have the answer but I have to show the working to my teacher.\"\n\n### Response:\"I am here to assist in your struggle.  The first thing to look for is a place for your number to live.  Is it in parentheses?  Is there a division sign in your formula (i.e. x = _____ = (5(-9))?  As you can see above, your number is actually a part of the formula.  The number will be the variable that you plugged into the formula.  However, you also need to recognize a number that is not a variable.  In this case, it is the \"-9\" that was subtracted five times.  We are able to use the parentheses to isolate your number and remove it from the other operands (i.e. the other numbers that were used in addition or subtraction).  The subscript is saying how many times the number has been subtracted.  We can make this equation look something like this. \nx = _____ = (______(-9))  x is the variable of the expression. \n_______ is your number.  It is not in parentheses because subtracting it one time would make it be a negative number.  Hence, there is no subtraction sign in between.  \n__________ is the \"-9\" you subtracted five times. You need to make it easier to understand.  For example, if you did (5(-9) then the \"5\" is not in parentheses because it does not make an operand that has a subtraction sign.  So, your equation can look like this:\n\nx = _______ = ----9\"\nThe \"=\" indicates that you got the answer you were looking for.\nTo see how we got the answer, your equation looks like this.\nx = -18 = ----9 x = -18 ----9 becomes x = -18 -5x = -18 --> x = -18 --> (-18) - 5x = 0 or x = 1 --> -7x = 0 or -7x = ---------- --> (7/x) = ------- --> The LCM(", "answer": " 255"}

It is assumed the soda cans and plastic bottles contain liquids and not air.\n\n5. It is assumed the glass bottles can be collected and returned after use.\n\n6. It is assumed that people can consume liquid from a can or bottle, not directly from a glass bottle.\n\n7. It is assumed the guests at the picnic cannot purchase soda cans or sparkling water bottles.\n\n8. Question: If they can consume liquid from a glass bottle it is possible that a person can hold a bottle of liquid and consume from it.\n\n9. If that is true, that person would be able to drink their own liquid at all times, regardless of whether it was sparkling water or soda.  That person would not have to purchase the soda or sparkling water to drink at the picnic.\n\n10. It is assumed that the people who had bottled juice did not mix with people who had soda or sparkling for a while.  It could just be people eating at tables and talking to each other without mixing at all.  Mixing is considered a change.\n\n11. People consume more soda and sparkling water than liquids in glass bottles because they are not required to pay for them and they last longer at the picnic.  People were not buying more glass bottled juices.\n\n12. One answer for the question is that when we see how many recyclable plastic and glass bottles were consumed instead of cans, we subtract the number of plastic bottles and sparkling water bottles because the quantity of liquids in the soda and the sparkling water is less than the juice.  It isn't possible that we subtract 50 bottles and count the cans, because that would count the empty cans that were consumed.", "answer": " 115"}

Well, you have a computer.\n\nNow what happens when you take a computer and replace it with a more human designed computer that focuses on AI and machine learning and logic? Turing machines.\n\nA turing machine is a device that can compute but lacks the ability to store information. It's designed solely upon a memory tape, and an infinite stack of tape.\n\nIt is able to record the moves made on the tape, but it does not record all of the tape. Instead it moves the tape, and it's contents, in the way of a head. The head also has the ability to mark the tape where to stop as well as erase parts of the tape, just like a real computer.\n\n#### Head:\nThe head on a Turing machine is the part that moves the tape, erases tape, and marks where to stop or go on the tape.\n\n#### Tape, Infinite Stack, and Memory:\nThe tape is a continuous tape, meaning that it must loop indefinitely. The reason the tape is infinite is to save time in programming the machine a solution. The tape is the only place information can reside.\n\nThe \"memory\" on a turing machine is that it keeps track of what is on the tape by using the following method:\nAn", "answer": " 480"}

Do you think math is useful to you as a programmer, and if it isn't, how will you overcome that?\n\n###Demonstration:Liquid nitrogen ( -234 degrees Celsius) is being used today as a way to keep food fresh and to make meat sausage easier to slice and package.  The main chemical property here that might be interesting is hydrogen bonding, although I might get into the chemical properties of freezing and thawing, too.  That said, there are a few good strategies involving math.\n\n  * If you are going to use a liquid nitrogen freeze-thaw process on food, it is usually better to freeze the food first and then thaw it, than vice versa (i.e., first thaw the food and then freeze it).  So for this, you can create a matrix that has three columns, labeled \"freeze\", \"thaw\", and \"overall\". There are 2 * 3 = 6 rows corresponding to the six combinations, and you can quickly determine the best result.  For example, you might get -8,6,19 (degrees celsius) for \"freeze\", -7,-3,20 (degrees celcius) for the \"thaw\" process, and 0, 3, -19 (degreces celcius) for the  \"overall\" process.  This last result for the 6 combinations would probably be the winner.\n\n  * You can also use what is known as a factorial to figure out when the food is done freezing.

{"text": "The question is asking how many books are in the library now, meaning that we must do some math to figure that out. It says that on Monday 124 books were taken out, but it doesn't specify how many were taken on Monday and Tuesday. It says that 22 books were brought back on Tuesday, but it doesn'tknow how many total. So I need to know the two totals before doing something with them. Total of Monday: books-taken: books-returned So, on Monday the library started with a total of 336 books and there were 124 were taken and 0 were returned, meaning that ended total was 212 books (124-0). On Tuesday 22 books were were brought back so there was a net gain of three books on Tuesday. Total of Tuesday: books-taken books-returned So Tuesday began with 212 books and took in 22, then another 22 came back bringing it back to the total of Tuesday. So, 212 started-22 brought-0 brought=212 Total today: books-taken-books-returned So if we take away the total from Tuesday, then the total left today was 212 takeaway 212=0 Total for the day: 212 books. I do not see a way for how to determine if the library would have gained or lost on Tuesday because the equation for calculating it is 0 books-taken. 212 was the starting point but subtracting the books taken from Tuesday the answer was 0. \n\n### Solution: The number of books in the library starting yesterday was 336, but there is always the potential that a library may be adding new books or may have lost them to other libraries. Libraries have a policy of keeping the number of books they have in their library relatively constant by adding or subtracting them as books come in or go out to make sure that they end up in the middle. With no knowledge of any changes the library could've gotten this would mean that today the library has a total of 212, which is the difference between the total of all the books taken in and the total of all the ones returned.", "answer": " 234"}

{"text": "There are 64 building blocks that would fit in the box. The perimeter of the box is 44 inches or 3.5577887889 feet. The width is 12 inches. To compute for the square inches of the box we find 12 inches squared or 12 x 12 or 144, then added to the perimeter. The perimeter is 12 inches plus the length which is 4 inches x 4 or 16, added to 144, so the length is 162 square inches. Next, we find the area of the box by subtracting the area of one block. The width times the height=6 square inches, so the length will be subtracted from 162 leaving us with 156 square inches. 4 blocks will fit in the perimeter squared. Then each block would be divided by 4 to find the square inches of each block. There are 2 different blocks and there are 4 perimeter squares we divided by, 8 total, which is 162/8=20.25 so square each block and multiply by 72 which is 6.62523203125 inches. 6 blocks fit in the length of the box.\n\n### Input1:\n\nAn equilateral triangle has sides of 6cm, 12cm on each side.

Sarah called the police and waited with the man until an ambulance arrived. While waiting, Sarah noticed the man looked nervous, and he told Sarah that it was hard for him to talk. He had suffered a stroke and suffered from dysphagia. What does it mean when a person suffers dysphagia?\n\n### Demostration\nAnswer:\nWhen a person suffers dystphagi, they have trouble swallowing food. The muscles in their throat contract to prevent food and liquids from entering the trachea, or windpipe. Drs. Mayo Clinic say this can occur if a person is in an accident, a stroke, or who has had surgery in their neck. However, according to Mayo Clinic, dysphagia may occur from GERD or it may be something else like a cyst in their esophagus. While many people who have dysphagia, or trouble swallowing, experience no severe symptoms, according to the Mayo Clinic it is important to seek medical attention because it may be the first symptom of a serious medical condition like GERD. If that is the case, it could lead to aspiration, or food entering the lungs, which can lead to a severe condition that can only be treated at a hospital, or be potentially fatal. For anyone with dysphagia there are lifestyle changes they can make to treat their condition. They should talk to their doctor about their diet. The Mayo Clinic recommends choosing foods that are soft, that are easy to chew and that require little to no chewing. You should also increase the number of liquids you drink during the day to help with swallowing. It is also important to never lie down for at least three hours following a meal so food can be fully digested and you cannot aspirate. Eating a small, well-balanced meal can help to prevent dysphagia by giving them enough nutrients to swallow easily.\n\n\n### Inputs:Which of these is true about dogs when traveling with them?\n\n### Answer:\nYes, according to this", "answer": " 21"}

{"text": "If you have a 40% chance of regaining control after going into a skid, what percentage chance of getting into a serious accident do you have without going into a skid? It seems fair enough that the chance of a skid goes up by five with every degree the temperature drops below freezing, but I'm unsure of what's meant by that: is it that there's a chance of one out of every three skids going to a serious accident, or is it that each additional degree that the temperature drops increases the chance of getting into a skid by five percent? It might be the latter, because of course a skid could happen without going into freezing temperatures. This is getting more clear, and you've made the assumption that the percentage of skids getting into a serious accident is going to be 40% + 0.4% for every degree the temperature dropping to below 32 degrees. And I agree with that assumption. Therefore, to figure out what percentage the chance of Annie getting a skid, if the temperature is 8 degree, you need to add up the percentage of skids causing accidents when the temperature drops to freezing and also add in this percentage to find what percentage the chance of getting into skid would be when the temperature drops below eight degrees. I assume there are 365 degrees below freezing, so that means that there should be 365 percent chance of getting a skid when the temperature drops by 2 degrees, 364 percent of getting a skid with a drop of 3 degrees, and so on. Adding up in that sense, the percent chance of getting a serious accident when Annie goes into skids, is 364.765842105% when her truck is in the freezing temperatures.", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "Connie's grandmother was likely born in 1940.\n### Rationale: To find the correct answer, we first multiply 2 by 2. Since 2 times 2=4, we know Connie\u2019s grandmother was born 2 times 4 years from her older sister. However, Connie\u2019s grandma was born after her older sister, so her older sister was not born 2 times 2 years from the older brother. Therefore, it is 2 times 2+4=6 years before her older brother would have been born (1936). We know the gap between the older sister and the grandmother is twice the gap between brother and sister, so we subtract 4, 2 times 2, from 1936-32 (older brother: 1932), giving us 1940 as the correct answer.\n### Rational explanation\n\n### Input::\n\n```\n$ python3 practiceExercise1.py \n1.

She made a scale drawing to demonstrate her knowledge of math. Next, she took her drawing and used it to build the 12 foot long piece of her model that would simulate the house and cars. She made the model and took real pictures of the model, not the house she measured. Finally, she wrote the information of the measurements together. \n\n### Deminsration 2:\nThe first picture was of all of the models, including 2 shark models and a boat. The boat was the biggest one, and the other two sharks were around it. There was one shark which was the only one that was black because it was not painted. The other sharks were painted in a different colors. The boat and all of the sharks were blue. \n\nThe second picture shows the boat being pulled away from the sharks by a strong boat puller that was pulling on ropes from far away, 3 sharks, a little bit of a tree, more water, another shark and the other shark as a background because it was not painted and not in any other picture. \n\nThe third picture shows the front and the top half of the boat and some water and trees. No people or sharks were in this picture. \n\n\n### Demindstration 3:\nThis shows some more models of boats, the same boat, and a different way of measuring the boat's distance away from a tree.

{"text": "One pack of bread contains four slices of bread.  I need 8 sandwiches, so divide 8 by 4 to get two slices of bread per sandwich.  There are two sandwiches per pack of bread, so multiply two by four to get eight sandwiches per pack.  The solution is 4.\n\n### Explanation:Let's start at the beginning.  Given 8 sandwiches and 4 slices of sandwich per sandwich, I need to figure out how many packs of bread it will take to fulfil this requirement.  There are two ways to solve this.  One way would be to count down the number of sandwich bread each pack contains and figure out if that matches the number of sandwiches required.  The other way would be to go backwards and count how many sandwiches per pack were needed to fulfil all required bread sandwiches.  Both of these work, but since going backwards is easier, lets start with that.  There are 8 sandwiches to be made, but each needs two slices of bread.\n\n###  There are eight sandwiches.  Each needs two slices of sandwich, so all I have to do is take 8 and divide it by 2 and multiply the result by the number of sandwich per pack.\n\n### If 2 \u00f7 8 = 0 (and it doesn't), then it's not a divisor.  If 2 \u00f7 = 4 (and it doesn'twon't) then I know I can take this result and multiply it by 2 to equal 4 sandwiches per pack\n\n### 8 \u00f7  2 = 4 (and does)\n\n### If it's smaller than 4 (and it is), then I have to take 4 and 8 and divide it again to get the number of sandwich sandwich required between the two.  In this case, a dividend of 4 will work to find the number of sandwich needed per pack.  If I can figure out what that number is, then I can multiply it by 2 because I will only ever need a certain number of sandwiches to make 8 sandwiches total.\n\n### As for the result, I know I have only one answer.  If I continue the math backwards, I would", "answer": " 4"}

You know Antonio's recipe is for 1/8 pound meat per meatball and Antonio has 8 family meembers including himself, so each family member is going to get (1/8)*8 = 1 meatball of hamburger. You need (4*1) = 4 (meatballs) to feed one member. Antonio has to make at least 32 (4*8) meatballs, and at least twice the meatballs for himself.

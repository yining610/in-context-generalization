They have a long tail, two forward-facing wings, and a beak.\n\nThe emu (Dromaius novahollandiae) is the largest of the ratite species. The average emu is 1.8 m (6 ft) tall to the top of its head and about 1.5 m (4.5 ft) tall at the point of its tail. Weight varies, though the average is about 90 kg (200 lb). Emu weight and size are in some cases larger than similar birds such as the cassowary.\n\nThe male emu is called an \u201cewes\u201d, the female is called a \u201chen\u201d, young are called \u201cchicks\u201d and the offspring of an ewe is referred to as an \u201cemu\u201d. Emus can lay up to seven eggs each year. They are capable of flight, but usually only use this short-range tactic to escape predators.\n\nAs adults, males usually measure about three feet shorter than females and weigh 40 kilos less. Males have bright red wattle around their neck, and this is often used in identification. Females do not have red necks, but instead have greyish skin, with a dark grey head.

A bat's biological life can be estimated by its life- expectancy. A bat's energy supply is provided by consuming food it hunts and gains from sunlight via photosynthesis. The bat can absorb energy from sunlight at a rate proportional to the area it  can shade by consuming food. The bat can move at the rate proportional to the ratio of its current supply of stored nutrients and its rate of consumption of nutrients. Write a Python program to estimate the maximum total minutes a bat can survive without food and direct sunlight. The program  should calculate the maximum total minutes the bat can be alive by calculating how many hours can pass in total while its biological life is supported.  It should return that value as a string.

{"text": "How many tables can a classroom house? You'll find that it's actually a fraction. With a classroom of thirty desks, thirty students would be possible. With a classroom that has 25 desks, sixty-five students would be possible. 15 classrooms, of which half have thirty desks in each one and the other half have twenty-five desks in each one, would total 450 students with each one of them having their own desk (1 x 1/3 = 3 and 2 x 1/3 + 1 = 6) = 10 students per classroom. There are thirty thousand possible seating arrangements in the twenty-five desk classrooms: 25 x 25 x 1/3 x 1/3. Which is why the answer is 30,000. 750 students would also be able to use the 25 desk room. Which is 10 students per room. 10 x 10 = 100. If we multiply that by 1.25 we'll get 125. There would 750 students in the twenty-five-desk classroom that's full. And 2500 students would be in the classroom with 30 desks per cubicle. Add them together we get 3750. 15 x 3 = 15. 15 of 3750 makes the number 260. We now have an answer, 750 students for two five-desk classrooms and 260 students for another five desk classroom which makes 1000 students. 3750 students would be at the 30 desk classrooms that are empty. We have a total of 4750 seats and we have 3950 seats. So 800 seats are left over to add with the 3750 seats in the fifty-desk classroom. The answer should be 300 seats.

The next round of files left him with 150, which is 400/2. He still has 150 files left after the first round and the second round of 400, so the final count he has left after deleting the second round would be (220/4)*400 = 25.\n\n### Expected Input:\n\nYou have 400 files in your folder and deleted 70% in the first round.

{"text": "His calculation is based on an estimate he uses after he took 10 minutes to make a customer's pizza.\n### Question:How many pizzas will Jimmy make when the carnival offers him 30 hours to do so?\n### Answer:The carnival allows 24 people to buy his pizzas and make more money.\n#### How to handle the above question\n1. The question is asking him to answer the last question, which is a bit difficult. So first I will calculate the amount of time his total work time needed to finish the work. Since he take 10 min to finish his customer's pizza and he has 7 hours, the total time work should be 70/10=7.5 hours. If he keeps selling to people in the carnival for 30 hours, he should sell for 30/10=3 pizzas. However, he made 7 pizzas in his calculation since he used an estimation he took 10min to make pizza and it should take 0.5kg for each pizza. This also means he made 7/0.5=14 pizzas, which is the estimated answer. So finally he should make 3/0.5=6 more pizzas. Now he should have 10pizzas left for him. He knows that each pizza needs to weigh 0.5kg. Using 10/0.5=20, which means he has 20 pizzas, which can be considered the last number.", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "8: There are 15 squares in 4 of the rows and in the two other rows they are only 2. Thus, if you add 15 + 2 = 17. If the 15th squares in each row are red, there would be 15 + 17 =32 square to color blue, we had to subtract the fourth of the rows (6) from 32 to leave the rest (26). We then subtracted those twenty six and that leaves us with ten, which would be the number of squares in the bottom row (25 + 10 = 35). But remember the fourth of the rows were colored red, that leaves us thirty one. The middle row which were red, leaves us to subtract 15. That leaves us with 16 (35 is thirty five, and 16 is 16). In total, there will be twenty six squares in the bottom row, thirty one in the middle row, and 16 in the first row. In the other case, in the top row there is two since the first four are colored blue and red, but since Marla colored blue rows, we can assume she didn't color the red squares of the first four, that leaves us twenty since there are 15 in the second row and 15 in the fifth row. Twenty two are in the last row and twenty one in the middle row there are twenty three in the 7th row.

E.g. 2 quarters, you need 6 - (2 - 6) which is 2 cents needed)\nNow if you have two coins with the same value, and the rule of 2.66 will apply. \ne.g. if we have two quarters, (2.73 * 2)/2 is 2.73/2.\n\n### Output 3:\n$$4.98$$\n\n#### Explination:\nThe rule of change is the number needed is the number of denominations - the denomination needed.

{"text": "14 pounds\n\n### Response Description:\nThe statement \"the exercise machine uses special technology...\" implies that whatever happens occurs because of the machine.  It's important that the machine is used, in addition to the weights, so the exercise will work.  Also, the weight will be 20% heavlier in its descent.  It takes two weights for every two pounds to create a 10 pound weight, so each weight is effectively an extra 5 pounds.  This gives us a total of 55 pounds of downward resistance (20% is 20/200 = 0.10) before the machine's technology kicks in.  This means that the weight actually weighs 30 + (.5)(30 +.5) = 30 + 15 = 45 pounds, or approximately 53 pounds.  If Tom has to use 53 pounds, then the answer is 53 -.10 = 53 - 5 = 48 pounds.\n\nOutput: 53 - 48 = 5.", "answer": " 360"}

We need to make sure we are subtracting expressions with the same variables that do not contain any multiplication or division operators.  The same can be true when we are adding.  We cannot add -x to x.\n\n### Task:  When we add two rational numbers, the result must be rational.  When we subtract one rational number from another, the result must be  rational.  Given any two rational numbers, we can also construct a number that is neither rational nor irrational.   What is it?\n\n### Task__B1 :  Rational numbers when added always result something rational.  Irrational numbers can combine to make a rational number.  The two add to a rational value and then get shifted to get a rational from the irrational add.  The rational value for any two irrational values is irrational, and this number is neither rational or irrational.  So the answer is D.\n### Input__B2 :  You can also say that the number that would occur if rational and irrational numbers were added together is...\n\n### Response__B2 :  irrational, the number that would occur of rational and irrational is irrational because you cannot add rational to irrational.  Only 0, and 1, and 1/0 would be the result of the combination.  If irrational and irrational were added  the result would also be irrational because each one can be negative or positive.", "answer": " 40"}

How old am I then\n### Solution Example: How old am I at that time? This would have been a lot easier if you wrote 12X in place of x. What I got is 12 divided by 4 divided by 2 divided by 10. However, I want x divided by 10 and then I will know that I have reached the right answer. I got 12 divided by x equals 4 divided by 1 equals two and this is in the correct format and 6+6 equals 12.\n\n### Solution Example II:\n### It doesn't matter where your age is relative to your brother's age because the only thing that matters is how much older you are than your brother. For example, if I was 17, and my brother was 36, then in 49 years we will both be 124, but my brother is five times older than me, so in that equation five times 17 equals 17 times 49.\n\n### What is the difference between 1,1 and 1.011.

Therefore, they are two different numbers. Therefore they are different between them there is a difference of 0.1.\n### Therefore if we are now looking for the difference between 7 and 7 then in simple algebra 7 subtract 7 and that equals 0.\n### Then if we take 1,011 and we divide by 11, we can write 6.99 and for this one we know it is a fraction.\n###", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "The cheetah would travel at 60 mph while the gazelle would travel at 40 mph. If the cheetah\u2019s top speed of 620 feet per minute is multiplied by 30, this is the total speed if a cheetah travels at its top speed, which is 18,600 feet per minute. The number of seconds it would take the cheetah to travel from two to two hundred and ninety-nine feet at its top speed equals 1014126 seconds, or almost 101 minutes and 41 seconds. The number of seconds to make 210 feet is 311/15 or 213/15 seconds. 0:16 is almost 16/10 of a second. After converting 4/5 of a second to a fraction, 5/20 is the final conversion. The fractional difference is 1/20, or 1/4, in its lowest terms. The final fraction is 41/20, which will be the answer. After the cheetah\u2019 s top speed of 640 feet per minute is divided by 30, that is the speed of the cheetah in its normal mode of travel. In his normal mode, it travels at a rate of 6 miles per minute, or 360 miles per hour, which is close to his top speed of 372 miles per hour. The total number of seconds it would have taken the cheetah to catch up to a gazelle and kill it in his normal mode of traveling is 0:2923. The number of seconds required to pass 213/41 feet equals 6/40 seconds or 1/20 seconds. By dividing 30/64 by 20, 1/32 remains as the final fraction. 0:1/32 is 1/32 of a second. The number of seconds for a cheetah to travel 41/32 of 213/20 equals 21:32/54 seconds.

{"text": "In order to find how much money the two girls spent we need to look at how much it costs for each ride and the number of rides they do for each ride. The formula to add up the number of times we do something is (10)(10)(10)\u2026 The number of times the formula is used is the number of times we ride each ride. If the number of times we rode each ride for bumper cars is k, then we know (10\u00d710)x 0.5 k. For example, if k=3, then (10\u00d719)\u00d7 0.5\u00d7 3. So for the first bumper car we multiply by one-half of how many times we ride the bumper car. Then (10\u00d75)\u00d7 (10\u00d72), and (10\u00d715),etc. So 2(10x5) + 4(10x4) + 3(10x3) = $15 + $40 + $75= $130\nThe same formula can be repeated to see how much is spent in a space shuttle (16 x 4 k) and Ferris wheel (15 x 3 k). Put all of these numbers together, and we get: $130 + $160 + $150 + $(10\u00d77) = $690.\n\n### Additional Resources:\nHere is useful links for anyone doing this project.\n[Free online math games](https://www.kidsmathgames.com/free-20-online-math-games-for-kids/107f4d9fc2541508be43158971d8a7b7)\n\n[Fun online science games for kids](https://www.bestsciencegamesforkids.com/)\n\n[Free online science practice for kids](https:/www.kidsnfun.com/learning/freeonlinek12education/)\n\n[Free Online Writing Games and Practice](https://www.topamericanwriters.com/blog/15-online-writing-games-and-online-writing-practice-for-students/)\n\n[Online K12 Science", "answer": " 50"}

{"text": "The 5th house has 12 gnomes in the front yard. \n\nThere are two ways to do this:\n1. By simply dividing 20 gnomines by 4, then subtracting that number from the house with the most gnomines to figure out the number in the next house, and so on and so forth. (Example, if there were 100 gnomines in total and there were 4 houses, house number one would have 25 gnomines in it, and you would add 25 to the second house, etc. until the second house has the most gnomines, which in this case is 25. Then you would just subtract 25 from 100 and you get 75 left. So if you were to keep following the counting pattern, you would discover that house number 5 has 12 gnoomines in the front yard.\n\n1. We can solve this problem using a more complicated division method. If we know that each house in the subtraction has 12 less gnomines than the house before it, then we can just subtract and subtract and subtract to get to the last house, which of course has less than 0 gnomes in it. Here are the steps that you would do:\n\t1. 12 gnomines are missing from house number 1.\n\t2. 12 gnome are missing from house number two.\n\t3. 12 gnoimes are missing from house number three\n\t4. 12 gnormes are missing from house number four\n\t5. 12 gnone are missing from house number five.\n\t6.

Notice that the sum of coefficients before X is zero and the sum of coefficients before Y is zero in order for an algebraic equation to be balanced. The equation is balanced.\n\nAnswer: Answers should be either TRUE, FALSE, or NA.\n\n### Rationales: \n\n- Anatomy is often used to describe the format and structure of an equation (like our equation above, which has two variables, two coefficients, and balance).\n- Here, anatomy isn't used to describe the structure of an equation, but rather to help identify which options could be true and which aren't possible (which can be the case when the variables are integers or have different coefficients).\n- It'll be helpful to remember how to identify the \"coefficient of X\" in equations, like 2x-5z-9y=10. First, we use \"X\" as the base for the coefficients and \"X\" can always be replaced with \"9z\". So, the coefficient of 'x' is 9z.\n- To identify NA, the only option is to identify answers which involve variables divided by zero, like in 3x/2y. Another example is x/(2x-2y) if you plug this into our equation and then multiply it out: x*(2+2)*y = xy + xy. However, this equation isn't balanced, so it wouldn't make sense to divide X by another number in the denominator when X would be present in the numerator.\n\n### Submission\n\n### Question: What do you get if you take away 20% from 510?\n\n### Input The answer you get is:\n\n### Rationale Anatomy is not used to describe the structure or format of the equation or to indicate the number of possible answers.", "answer": " 41"}

Then Kris is younger and n is the difference.\n\nKr. i = 10*n = 24 and Herbert is 10* (n-1) = 14.\n\nThe question is: if Kr. i = 24, then Herbert i = 14 + 24 = (14 + 9) + 14 = 33 or 25-14 = 11, and Kr. i = 35.", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": "Answer: 3600\n\n### Input:$85 can buy 7 litres of water and $55 can buy 11 litres of water. If you have $343 in your account, how many water can you buy?\n\n### Rationales:\nInput:$85 can buy ___ litres\n1. We know that $85 can buy 17.65 liters of water\n2. If $85 can buy __ amount of water, and we are given $343\n3. The answer would be $343*(100/17.64)/5 = 15.35\n4. 15.32 > $16 (what we want to buy)\n5. $15 or less is the solution.\n\n### Input:#1. Wealthy men usually keep beautiful women as housewives in their houses.\n2#. Most of the beautiful housewives come from a well-respected and wealthy family.\n3#. If a man has $500 for 30 days rent, how many beautiful housewives can he have.\n\n### Rationale:\n1#. We are given that $500 equals $16.66 which means that $16.67 is the maximum amount of money that we might have per day.\n2#. This means that it might take us 9 or less women to rent a place.\n3#. This means 9 women times 30 rent makes $12.41.\n4#. After this was calculated, the question asks how many women can be housewives.\n5#. To answer this we use the following equation: 4 * 30 == # of Women times 30 == $12.40\n\n### Rationale:\n1#. $15.99 is the price of a chicken burrito.\n2#. $5.39 is the price of two chicken burritos.\n3#. 5 * 5 is fifty because five is a ten and a one.\n4#. Ten minus five is the solution.", "answer": " 195"}

{"text": "$10\n### Rationale: At first I thought that $10 was the correct answer, but after reading over the question again, I realized that they don't have to add the amount she put in, because her piggy bank would of just kept getting bigger. So if she put in a total of $450 in four years, she couldn't possibly not be missing any money if she added so much in each year. So then I added up the amount of money she would put in each year. The first year, it would be $50, the second year, it would be 74, the third year, $86, and the fourth year, it would be. Then it would of started over again and ended up at $74. This would give us our answer of $890.

{"text": "Fourth scroll fourteen hundred twenty-five years old\n\n### In response to above:\n\n1. Find the amount of years between the oldest and second oldest scroll by noting they are both 4080\n2. Deduct half of the second scrolls age from the amount given (4080 - 2040 = 2040)\n3. Then take that number and subtract it from the oldest scrolls age (4800 - 2000 = 2800)\n4. Then you divide the second number (2040) by the third (2800) to find out the fourth scrolls age (2040/2800 = 0.7293)\n5. Then take the fourth scrolls age and subtract the second scrolls age to subtract 2040 from 1425 which equals 220... add this to the original 4080 from the oldest scroll which equals 4220\n6. Repeat step 4 to find fifth scroll's age (0.7294/3416 = 0.1559)\n7. Subtract second oldest scrolls age from fourth scrolls age (1425 - 220 = 1205)\n8. Then divide fifth scrolls age (0.155) by the number we just subtracted (1205/1205 = 0.1114)\n9. Take the fifth scrolls age and subtract fourth scrolls age (01544 - 1205 =.0339)\n10.

Of the employees, 8 of them, were hired by the Director. In order to have over 2 times as many of the employees hired by the director, you will have to put an '8' in the blank and multiply by 2. However, even if we do this, it still doesn\u2019t satisfy the answer because we can not add an 8 into the blank since we have already used the '8' to indicate the number of employees that were hired by the directory. To solve the question we will have to subtract the employees that have already been hired from the total number of employees (14 minus 8).

{"text": "12\n\n### Response Rationale:We first need to express the problem in terms of a system of equations to determine the age of all four children. Consider the following system:\n1. x + 15 = 22 (first child = x + 15)\n2. x + 1 = 23 (second child = x + 2)\n3. x + x = 26 (third child = x + x)\n4. x + (x - 2) = 12 (fourth child = x + (x -2))\n5. Subtract 2 from 4, we get: x = 12 - 2\n6. x = 10 (fourth child age = 10)\n7.

{"text": "Farmer Brown's flock has 120 bodies and 120 legs. You can find the entire body/legs count for any farm by multiplying the number of heads on the farm by the number of legs per head.\n\nFarmer Brown has 60 heads so the 60 head x 2 legs = 120 legs, which is equal to 120 bodies per farm. You can also find each individual bird's body and legs by adding up the body and legs.\n\nSaying there are 60 heads in Farmer Brown's farm is the same as saying there are 60 bodies and 119 legs. There are 60 bodies but there are some left legs unaccounted for. Adding this count to the total should bring you to 120 legs: 60 heads x 2 legs = (60 bodies + 119 legs).\n\nIn conclusion, there are 120 emus in Farmer Brown'S flock, because 120 bodies/legs times 2 legs = 240 for each whole emu. \n\nAnswer: There are 120.\n\n### Revision:\nFarmer's Brown flock has 100 heads per emu and 60 total. Multiplying 60 by 2 gives 120 total, meaning 120 birds in total. A farmer would raise a farm with 20 per head if they owned 120. Because there are 60 total heads on his farm, he has 120 total legs per emu, which can be found by multiplying his total per emu by two. He has 60 total head per emu since he has 60 total legs per emus.

Patrick is 10 years old. \nPatrick is halfway to being 15. If Robert is halfway to his next birthday of turning 31, Patrick should be halfway to his next year of his age. \n\n#### Solution:\nFor Patrick's age we will use the steps:\n- Let X be Patrick's current age. \n- Let X+3 be his next year of age. \n- Patrick is not exactly half age of Robert.

{"text": "Holly takes 72 medication pills a day and 5 weeks a month. Therefore, Holly takes 3x2x2x5=300 pills a week.\n\nInput: This question is very similar to the previous question. Give an estimate of the maximum cost of a hotel room in Europe as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Choices:  A) 10 B) 5 C) 1000 D) 9.88427024975329 E) 5 Million\nRationale: The first thing to do when solving this problem is to find the maximum amount, then figure out how much it actually is. Because of the pandemic, tourists are no longer allowed to travel, causing 9.1% of the tourism budget in Italy to be cut. Because of this, the demand for hotel rooms has decreased and is approximately 60%, so therefore the cost of a hotel room is about 10 times less than it would be if people were still allowed to travel. There are 24.2 million tourists in Europe, so multiplying that by 2 gives you roughly 48 million Euros spent from tourism each year. Because the pandemic has cut 9.1% out of that budget (1.92 million Euros), that leaves a budget of 46 million Euros. This is where the 10 time factor comes in because there were originally 112 million (48 million * 2 = 96 million). This is approximately 100 Euros.\n\n### Response\n\nA) 10 B)\\ 5 C) 500 D) 6.666666 D) 10.1 E) 14.14", "answer": " 77"}

Jar B has 60 more marbles than Jar A, so 110 + 60 = 170; therefore, Jar C, B, and A all have equal amounts of marbles totaling 110 (28 + 12 + 22 + 12 +12).\n6. 110 is the total number of marbles in the 3 jars.\n\n### Input:-125 divided by 3 gives 41.-125 divided by the remainder of the division by 2 gives -4.\n\n### Response:-\n1.

{"text": "She still needed $612.50.  Let's do some basic computations to come up with this answer.\n\nThere's this formula for finding out the value X when you subtract Y from a number Z:\n\nX = Z - Y\n\nSince this formula provides you with the difference between two numbers, it is called \"deleting\". \n\nHence, the formula we'll use in this problem is the following:\n\nX = 500 - 2/5 X\n\nSince we know that the shop owner gave her 15% discount, we need to multiply X by 1.15 to come up with her remaining bill:\n\nY = 0.15 X\n\nX - Y = 500 and \n\n500 - 0.15(500) = 495\n\nRearranging the first equation, we get:\n\n495 = X - (0.15)X\n\nRearrangesing the second equation, we have:\n\nX - 62.5 = (500 - (0.175(500))\n\nTherefore, \n\nX - 25 = 474.75\n\nSubtracting 25 to the left-hand side of the equation, we have \n\nX - (25) = 474\n\nAnd then, multiplying both sides by 2 to get our final answer:\n\nX = X -15.4\n\nX + 15.4 = 474 \n\nX = 499.4\n\nHence, Mrs. Smith needed $499.4 more money than what she brought with her to buy her products.\n\nIn conclusion, Mrs. Smith needed two-fifths (2/5) more money than what she had brought in $500. The shop owner gave her a 15% discout. We applied the formula to obtain our answer, which is $499.50. Therefore, Mrs. Smith still needed an additional $499.\n\nAnswer: She needed an additional $449.40. \n\n### Input and Output example:John only gave a perfunctorian examination of", "answer": " 95"}

The number of people who believe that water boils more on the bottom of the pot than on the top is how many times six times the number of people who believe in the earth revolving around the Sun?\n\n### Demostration\n\nRationales:\n\n1. The question mentions six times as many people.\n2. This suggests that there are six times as many people who do not believe in the earth revolves on the top as bottom compared with those who do believe in it.\n3. The question then mentions that six times of more people (which is defined as six times the number of non-believers) believe in boiling water on the bottom compared to the top.\n4. This again tells us that among the people who do believe in the earth revolve on the top. six times more also believe in boiling water more on the bottom compared to on the top.\n5. Since the question asks how many times six times more people compared to the non-believers, it can only mean that the non-believer's population must be equal either to zero or 1.\n6. Therefore the number of people (N) who are not non-believers is 3, the sum of the numbers of six times more believers on the top.\n7. Hence, the number of non-number of votes is 3.\n8. Therefore, the total number of votes and also non-votes (N) who also do not believe on the earth revolves around the top is N+7, which is 78.25\n9. Since there were seven non-believers compared to believes also in boiling water on these positions (48+36), or 84.25 votes, the total votes for water on both sides are 84.24+78.25, or 162.5.\n10.

So, his new salary will be $60,000 as a minimum. Since $60,0 + 40% = $80, 000, we know that his new salary is greater than $60,0. Then, we can substitute his new salary in the original equation: \n\nNewSalary = Current Salary\n$160,00 = $60,0\n\nSince $160,0 < $200,0, his new salary is $160, 0. \n\nAnswer: Roberto's current salary = $160,\n000.\n\n### Input :Gina has an allowance of $1200.

{"text": "Answer: twenty-five.\n\n### Input John was given the task of creating an ad for his family farm. He had trouble deciding which idea for an ad to use. How can he choose the best one?\n\n### Demostration:\nAfter determining how many apples Diane and Cecile bought, we can put this information in the form: \"Diane bought x apples and Cecile bought x apples.\"\n\nThe equation that can be used to solve this problem is: \"Diane + Cecile = twenty-three apples.\" When the two equations are combined together, we can use x to represent the number of apples Cecile bought and solve for the value of x.\n\nThe next step would be to plug in numbers for Cecile to help solve the equation and give Diane twenty-three additional apples than Cecile combined. This makes twelve more apples than Ceicle and sixteen more from Diane.\n\nThe next thing to do would be to take the total sum and split it into the numbers of apples given by Diane and Cecile. This makes the equation: (Diane + Cecile) / 5 = x. When we plug in x into the equation we have \"Diane + Ceicle\" in place of \"x\", we can take the denominator.\n\nThe next equation would be: \"(Diane + Cecile)\" / 5 = [Diane / 5], thus making ten more apples than what Cecile bought. When we plug ten together we have \"Diane\" in place of x, making the equation \"Diane /5\"\n\nAs you can see, the equation can be solved by using two of the variables. You can also use two variables, but you need to solve for them separately. This would make the equation [(Diane + Cecile / 5) - ten] for Diane and Cecile [5 - (Diane + Ceicle / 5)], thus creating an equation for Cecile.\n\nThe next steps would be to solve the equations together. If Cecile bought more than ten more apples, Diane would have bought twelve. If Cecile bought fewer than twelve, Diane would have sixteen more. This means they would have bought 24 total.\n\nOne thing you can do is to use algebra to solve this. To do this, substitute Diane's equation with the one", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": "512 bricks of snows\n### Rationales:\n1. The first key is the following statement:  \"Libby is building an Igloo in her back-yard using bricks of snows\"\n2. Which then leads to this question. If Libby is building an ig-loo than she must be using bricks of snow as her materials. The bricks of snow are not limited to any number. Libby can use hundreds of bricks, thousands of bricks, or even millions of bricks.\n3. However if Libby is building an Ig-loo \"in her back-yard\" then there needs to be a restriction. The restriction on the bricks of snow means Libby is only able to stack 12 bricks in the bottom half of the ig-loo(the second half) and if she stacks eight bricks in the top half(the first half)\n4. Thus the bottom half of the Ig-loo contains the first 12 bricks and the top half of the Ig-log contains the last eight bricks. As each of these segments is a half(the ig-loo is in one half of her yard) they can both contain 12 bricks.\n5.

We conclude that he got an A average for his semester work. We also conclude that this is sufficient information to answer the question.\n\nThe questions to be answered: what is his weekly salary and what is his annual income?\n\nTo determine the weekly salary, we'd first determine his average hourly pay to answer this question.\n```\n$576/20 = $28.80 per day\n```\n\nThe hourly rate for his daily work is:\n```\n$28.80/8 = $3.60 per hour\n```\nTherefore, he earns $6.20 per hour of work. His monthly salary therefore is $333.60.\n\nHis yearly income is simply his monthly income multiplied by 12 months:\n$$333.6 x 12 = 4012.8$$\nThen adding the weekly salary with the yearly income:\n$$(4012.7 + 6.2) = 4018.9$$\nTherefore, Anthony makes $4119 for a year, which works out to $343.31 per week.\n\n### Comment on:\n- This problem has a small error, it should read:\nAnthony\u2019s monthly salary was $576.\n- This may be better classified as a reasoning problem, since the only thing given is Anthony's salary.

I have made several mistakes and I was not sure if a partial credit answer would be accepted, but I will do my best to explain the answer as I went through the problem.\n\n\nI first understood the problem by taking the beginning amount of cookies and then adding everything together to figure out how many were left after they split everything up. If the total number of cookies that Sabrina has was 20 and she only gave half to her brother there would be 10 cookies left with her. After that, from how the problem is presented it sounds like she has half now which would be another 10 so that brings us to 20. That is where I ran into a problem because my sister has two-thirds of the remaining cookies and since there are 15 she is only left with 10-5 so all in all she has 5. That brings me to a total of 25. My sister then says that she got three cookies left and my mother only got half of the other number. My mother then says that she had two left.\n\nTo get to the 25 I started from the beginning and when I was adding five and two I had seven and the three combined were 10 and it is at this point that I realized that the answer is incorrect. When I had 45 cookies with her mother only taking 20 and adding that to the 10 she split with her sister, she is not taking any off the total but it is still half of the total so that would make 40 so her 20 still leaves her 20 and then 10-7 is 3. At this point, my mother has 3 left at 48 and when you factor in the 10-7 she is at 35 so she only has 15 left and then 14-10 is 4 that she gives to my sister and then my sister only has 10-3=7 which she gives to me and I am at 40 and finally 40-5 is 35.

According to the question, the water supply is alternating (on and off) and the amusing process is running for 1 minute then closed the water for 1 min and then start the water flow process. The first problem is that the flow rate is for each minute and that means there is 7 openings and 7 closings for every one minute and after the third closure (on the third minute) we lose 3 liters of water during that time.\n\n### The second equation:\nSo the second equation we need to solve is how much water will be in the tank after 12 minutes.\nLets start counting the water in liters (liters of the tap) in each minute: the first minute the amount is zero the 2nd minute is 12 * 2  so the amount is 24 during the 3rd minute the amount is 2 * 3  so it is 6, during the 4th minute the amount is 4  so it is 24, during the 5th minute is 0 so 24, the 6th minute is 0, the 7th minute is 4  so 24, The 8th minute is 0, the 9th minute it is -6 so 24, The 10th minute it is 2  so 22, the 11th minute it is 4 so all together the amount of water is 24 + 2 + 4 + 4 + -6 + 2  + 4 + 2 so total the amount of water is: 24 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 2  +0 + 0 and that means the first minute it is 0.

{"text": "- The number\n- For instance, let\u2019s assume that you have some number of legs with an odd number like 11.\n\n### You multiply by one because we subtract 1 from the actual value.\n1. For example, 7x(8x8x8x8...x8x8x1).\n2. If I want to multiply seven times eighty-five times ten times ten it will become 7x85x10x10x1x1x1x, and it will become like this till I get the value 85 x 10 x 10 = 850. So we are getting the value 85 because 85x10 = 800 + 5 x 85, thus the total becomes 8005 = 9,000 = 85 x 7 x 10 x.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- So 7 times 85 times 10 times 10 is equal to 65 times ten, if 85 is divided into 10 then you have 8.5 which is equal to 10 times one so it is equal to 1 and the value becomes 6 x 10 + 10 x 9 = 645. That is why 65 + 10 = 66 and I get 7 x 6 + 8 = 35. That\u2019s why I got the value of 355 in this step I got 4 times 85 which is equal to eighty-five times 5, which is 425.", "answer": " 32000"}

(If you were to pair each couple based on the total number of pandas, rather than the ratio of mated pandas to total pandas, you would achieve the same result in the answer, because if you consider pandas in groups/couples then the total number of pandas would end up back to 15.)

If he had $99 dollars left in his pigeon jar after a year, how many dollars, in dollars, did she have first?\n\n## Solution:\n1. 1, 1 - 24 x 4 = 64 dollars\n2. We're given these pieces of information:\n    1. Randy spent $4 on every trip to the store.\n    2. Randy made 4 trips to store every month.\n    3. All this takes place in a year.\n    4. He started out with $104 in piggies (we're only told he 'had $104 dollars').\n    5. The outcome is that Randy has $64 left.\n    6. Therefore, the outcome must be that Randy started with $208.\n3. This is what we know, in the context of the question and answer.\n    1. We know Randy started with $104, went to the store 4 times every month - which makes it 48 trips in year - and then had $64 left. We assume Randy was making these 48 trips every year because that math makes sense.\n    2. We know Randy spent $108 over time - $104 for his starting investment plus $4 for every trip.\n    3. We know the rate of $4 per trip makes sense to us - he dropped at a store 4 times every year and spent $4 each time.\n    4. We know he lost (spent) $4 every month.\n\n4. In conclusion: We conclude Randy's total investment was $208.

Therefore, \\(x\\) means the world's population must have also decreased by \\(0.01\\) percent.\n\nBy the formula \\(x\\% = 0.01 * x\\), we can arrive to \\(x \\times 0.01 = 1\\); because \\(x = 0.0999999\\), \\(x\\) must be between \\(0.099\\) and \\(0.100\\). We will assume \\(x = 0\\); therefore, the population of the whole world had decreased from \\(950\\) or more years ago until now.\n\nHence, the answer is D: $900$, almost a thousand years!\n\n\n### Input \n\nWe can also prove a result, say p, by means of another result, say r. The result p is then called a Theorem which uses another Theorem r (or theorem r used by theorem p); the result r is then called an Assumption (of theorem p); and p is called a proof of r.\n\n### Response \n\nSo long as p is a theorem, r can be whatever; just so long as it can be proved that r is a theorem - that is,", "answer": " 14"}

In the question, every time they give more information about someone, then mention another woman they're referring to someone specific or by naming them.\n2. \"Age order\": a lot of people believe that age order goes from young to old and it should refer to children to grandparent.\n3. \"age order\": the age order should be a child > parent > grandparent because a child is biologically different to their parent (they are their biological child and their parent had them, they didn't give birth to them) and the biological child of their parent is their grandparent, so to make it more consistent people decided to go in that order (child>parent>grandparent)\n4. A: Alice\n5. B: Bjorn\n6. C: Calista\n7. D: 80 (since alice is older)\n8. E: 20 (since calista is young)\n9. F: 50 (since bjorn is in between)\n10. G: 23 (because 80 (alice) + 20 (calista) + 50 (bjorn) = 150 and 150 divided by 3 = 50 (age 50) since their ages add up to 150\n\n\n## Instructiom\n1. Find two people", "answer": " 7"}

Hence, Tara's balance after paying for 6 months will be 1800 dollars. Therefore, the above question is answered with the rationales 1. The first month is the down payment of 20% of the total cost\n2. The computer shop, will offer financing installment for the remaining 80 % of the cost\n3.

Choices:  A. $6,150       B. $5,340 C. $7,080       D. $6,214       E. $7,520\nRationales: The question asks us for the cost of 98 tickets for a Cubs game. We know that there are 1 ticket per 70$, given that $70 buys us one ticket.\n\nSo now, $70 * 98 = x. We know that x = 70*(98/70) = 70 (98/70)/70 = something smaller than 1, because x is a cost and cannot be something smaller than 1.\n\nThus, we get x = 6.726 < 1, and thus our answer is A.\n\nInput: The price of gas in Tucson is $2.25.

The options can be categorized as follows:\n    * Price: an item's cost or amount that it is worth\n    * Cost: an item's value, as given by the amount one must pay for it\n    * Sale: a transaction or exchange of ownership of an item, as given by a set price for the item\n    * Increase: the state of rising in value, amount, or size or becoming bigger or greater in number\n    * Increasing: progress from a lower to a higher level, position, value, degree, etc.\n    * Rise: to go up from a lower to a greater level or degree\n    * Rising: proceeding from a lower to a more elevated or greater condition or place\n    * Fluctuate: vary rapidly in value, amount, rate of growth, or magnitude or be uncertain or changeable\n    * Fluctuating: to vary rapidly in value, degree, size, amount, etc.\n    In this context, we want to emphasize that the values are changing.\n3. When the price is changing, the item is:\n    * fluctuating\n    * rising\n    * in an increasing state\n4. The options that indicate a rise in price or values do not fit because this question focuses on the state of the price and not if the price is increasing.\n5. Option D: escalating is a word that doesn't fit because we don't want to emphasize the act of rising.\n6. When an item is rising, its price is increasing.  So the best option is A: increasing.\nAnswer: A: increasing\n\n---\n#### How the AI will function\n\nThe software provided will output sentences that explain how to complete a given task with the given set of steps using appropriate synonyms and sentence structures.\n\n---\n#### Training files\n\n```python", "answer": " 140"}

{"text": "The question asks about the cost of each item, not the total cost.  As a result, we can discard the options that deal with the cost of the items.  Since the total cost is given, each amount can be easily calculated from it.\n1, $95 is the cost given and Phillip spends $14 on orANGES, so $95-14 = $81.\n2, $95 is again the cost given and PhillIP spends $25 on APPLES, so $95-$25 = $70.\n3, $95 is once again the cost given and Philadelphia spends $6 on candY, so $95--6 = $89.\nSince there are not enough options given in the choices, a different approach is needed to get the answer.\n\nThe problem can be simplified.  The total cost equals the amount of items multiplied by the cost of each item.  Therefore, multiply 95 by the prices to get the cost of everything.\n\n1. The solution to the cost of fruits is to multiply 95 times the price of each, giving 95+25+6=126.\n2. The cost of the candY is (95*6)/6 = 95.\n3. The solution to the total cost is to add the three cost amounts: 126+95=221.\n\nThe money remaining can then be determined by subtracting the cost from the total amount given.  The question states that Phillip was given $95, and he spent $14 (oranges), $25 (apples), and $6 (candY), giving a total of $95 + 221 = $316\nThough, he starts with $95 at the beginning.  Hence, subtracting 95 from 316 leaves $221 in his account.\n\nSo the solution to the question is that he has $221 remaining.\n\n\n\n\n# Writing Guide:", "answer": " 50"}

Therefore, in this case, we are calculating the gratuities in the total bill as $140 + (140 x.1) + 10 = $165 and the total for the order is $140 + $10 = $150. \n\nThe total bill amount is ($140+$165) + $10 =$355. So the amount charged for gratuities is $165.\n\n### Rationale: 1.\nThe question's instructions are to calculate how much to charge a customer for gratuities when taxes are added in, in a shady restaurant. \n2.  The question states that the sales tax rate in the restaurant is 10% and the cost for the order is $80 for the NY Striploin and $10 for the glass of wine. \n3.

However, the question asks how much to charge the customer in $140+$80+$10 = $230. \n5.  Thus, the gratuities can be calculated as ($165+$10) + $165 + $10 = ($150+$165+$9) = $230+9+199 = $355. \n6.

Round to the nearest tenth if the decimal is between 0.1 and.9. Round to two decimal digits if it is between.10 and.90.

The cost will equal the amount Martha has to pay for the berries, divided by the amount of berries in a cup. The cost will also equal the amount Martha will pay for the cream, divided by the amount in a cup. Then, we can compare the costs of the strawberry and raspberry ice-creams, to see how they differ.\n\n### First, We substitute the information we were asked for(amount of Berries and Cream needed) with the numbers from the question(4 cups cream and 2 cups berries), then we find how much Martha would have to spend to make 1 quart (4 cups) of strawberry ice-cream.\n\nThe cost of making one quart (4 cups of liquid) of strawberryice-cream is as follows:\n\n$3(4 cups of strawberries) + $4(4 cups of cream)= $3(4 cups strawberries) = $", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "The total earnings for Uki's bakery for five days will be $100.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n#### Instructions\nWe are given Uki, the owner of a bakery, and some pieces of information regarding Uki's baking.  We are told that Uki sells four products at three different prices.  In a day, Uki is able to make about 20 cupcakes, 10 packages of cookies, and 20 packages of biscuits.\n\n#### Problem\n\nBased on the information above, how many cupcakes will Uki be able to make for a day?\n\n#### Reasoning\n\nUki sells cupcakes for $1.50.  Each cupcake takes a day to prepare and can be sold at $1.5.\n\n#### Analysis\n\nBased on this information, Uki's total revenue will be $X per day and $X*5 days = $5X.  Therefore, we can solve for X as we have: $X = $5 * $1.50 = $7.50  Therefore, for five days, Uki sold 7.5 cupcakes.\n\nLet us analyze Uki's cookie production.  Uki sells cookies for $2 per package.\n\n#### Findings\n\nWe need to understand how much Uki can realistically make.  Since each cupcake takes her a day, she can make 20 cupcaked a day.  However, Uki also sells cookies, which only takes one day to make.  Therefore, Uki can make 10 cookie packages a day.  This means that Uki can only make 7.5 cupcake per day.\n\n### Findings\n\nWe will now find out how much Uki can make a day.\n\nFrom the above findings, we can say that Uki can only sell 7.5 products per day.  If we apply this to a whole five days, Uki would sell 7.5*5 = 37.5 products per week.\n\n### Interpretation\n\nUki can earn up to $137.5 per week.  If we multiply by 20, Uki can be earn up to $", "answer": " 350"}

Her company is expected to have 4 new hires per month and 2 new positions per month. What is the average number of positions that will be available for new hires per month?\n\n### Input :The number of new hires per month\n\n### Demostration:\nFirst, we must know that a hire is a person who is employed full or part time and an availability is an opening in which a person works. (The above word were the best possible for my understanding.)\n\nThe first number in the question is 4. Which means that there will be 4 new hires in a month. Then we divide that number by 1 which is the number of hire in a month.\n4/1 = 4\n(4/1)2 = 4/1\nThen we multiply the number of 4 and 4. In order to get the new number of 8.8 and 4.2. Next, we divide (8.8/4.2)\n8.8/4,2 = 2\nThen we multiply the the number 2 and 1. Thus we will have 2 x 1 = 2 new hires. And finally 2 new hires = 2/4 = 2/12 = 1/6. In the above word is not clear for me but the number will be equal to: one new hire for every 12 new positions\n### Input:A teacher decided to plan on giving students an extra assignment on Wednesday since the weekend would be too long for a student to wait after a test on Monday.

{"text": "Bryan spends sixteen hours in customer outreach posts a day. Marketing posts require less effort, so Bryan only spends seven hours on marketing posts a day. He thus spends 23 hours a day working.\n\nRationale: 1. Bryan works eight hour days for a total of 8 hours each day.\n2. He does four different tasks: one hour of customer outreach, two hours of marketing, four hours of advertisement, and 8 hours left for other tasks.\n3. He has 8 divided by 4 = 2 hours of downtime per day.\n4. He has not made provision for breaks, so he actually works for 25 hours a day (8 hours + 2 hours break = 10 hours; 10 hours + 2 hours back = 12 hours).\n5. He works sixteen hours per day, as stated at the beginning of the question. However, seven of these hours are for marketing and advertisement, making his total workday time to be 8+7 = 15 hours.\n6. One hour of customer outreaches makes up one quarter of his working day when calculated as 23/8 = 2.875.\n7. Twelve hours are advertisements and marketing posts, which makes up 12/15 or 1/1.5.\n8. He spends 16 hours on customer outreaches, since it makes up 1/2 = 1 hour of the 16 working hours in each day.\n9. One more calculation is that 8+7+12 + 16 = 33 hours. This 33 hour per week total is equal to the eight hours per day times the five working days in a week.\n10. The total number of hours he works also equals his 5/7 (5/7 multiplied by 7 = 7/7 = 1) factor. This equilates to 33/7 = 4.685, which is an accurate calculation since it adds up to 33.\n11.

Do you try and estimate the number of hours he has worked through a process of elimination, or just plug a number in, or maybe even just say \"I don't know\" and find something else to do. Well, if I can't understand how the question is worded you'll probably have the same issue with answering it. That's why we begin by trying to figure out what the prompt tells us. In this case, it tells us that Gary earned overtime because a lot of people had taken sick days, and that he earned overtime for every hour at a rate of 1.5 his normal wage. The problem asks for the number of hours he worked that week. We can then go back to the information and figure out what we know. All of the options will either say that we are guessing \"I don't really know how many hours he worked. It might be 60 something hours, or 80 something hours. It is hard to say.\" or that the hours are somewhere between 35-145. If I do say the hours are between 35 and 145, I would be wrong if I chose any one of those answers. But also, I shouldn't say \"I don' t know\". So the best option would be 50 or -57, which is basically saying that I made guesses.\n\n### Response 2:The reason that answer D sounds better is because it offers more information. The other options are all missing a lot of information. The only way that I could use these answers is if I got to see the problem and the answer choices before. Then, I could try to guess as well as I could what the correct answer was. If I was given the answer choices beforehand, I would have to have access to the problem. Also, if I was given the problem beforehand, it would be easier to answer the questions or questions that are worded differently.", "answer": " 52"}

{"text": "The total number of miles the friends run together is 20 miles, as they run 8 miles more than the other, who runs 12 miles.  The total number of miles is 12+8+12=20 miles.\n\n### Rationale:1. The question states, in simple terms, that the two runners, Harvey and Sam, run and see who is better at running.\n2. The context provided by the question indicates that the two runners run one track field.\n3. Both runners run for a while, then stop for a while and vice-versa.\n4. Given this context, the question is asking about the running times for both individuals, combined or totaled.\n5. The running times for Harvey and Sam are:\n6. Harvey runs 10 miles and then stops while Sam runs 4 miles after, then Harvey runs another 8 miles.\n7. Sam runs a total of 8 miles after Harvey's first 10 mile run, which Sam ran after Harvey had already stopped running.\n8. Therefore, the total number of miles run by the two runners is 12+4+8.\n9. The problem, therefore, is to find the total number of miles Harvey and Sam run, i.e., 12 miles, which can be seen as the total result of Harvey and Sam's running race.", "answer": " 32"}
{"text": "There is 100% of each type of chocalate bars in the box. There are a total of 100 candy bars. \n\n### Input :Alice is taking a trip to California by plane, then driving to Las Vegas to get to California. She flies 1,200 miles round-trip and then drives 250 miles to Las Vegas. What percentage of the trip is in a plane and what percentage is driving?\n\n### Demostration:\n\n#### Method 1\n\n1. Start by writing the proportion of the trip in a plane as:\n   a. total miles of the trip / total plane miles\n   b. 1200/1450 = 0.83\n2. Next, write the proportion of the trip using driving as:\n   a.) total miles of the trip/ total car miles = 0.81\n3. Notice that the number in the numerator (total miles of the trip) stays the same, but the number in the denominator (total car miles) changes.\n4. Therefore, the way to calculate the mileage by car is to subtract the mileage by plane from the total mileage:\n   b. 2,050 - 1200 = 850 miles by car\n\n#### Method 2\n\n1. Start with the same two equations, except to be more clear in what is changing in the denominator the denominator gets a different symbol:\n   a. Plane miles: total miles of trip / plane miles = total miles of trip / 1450 = total miles of trip/m\n   b. Car miles: total miles of the trip \u2013 plane miles / car miles = total miles of the trip - 120 / 1451 = total miles of the 2,048 /c\n2. Solve by cross product elimination:\n   d. Plane miles: 12 / m\n   e. Car miles: 848 /c\n3. Therefore, the total mileage by plane is 1200, and the total mileage by car us 848 miles.\n\n### Answer:The miles Alice traveled in the plane = 1200 miles, the miles Alice traveled by car = 8", "answer": " 25"}

{"text": "110\nInput:There are four colors. \n\n### Rationales:\nExplanation:\n\nNote: We will be using the abbreviation \"f\" to symbolize \"four\".\n\nStep 1: The first part of the question is to count the color of marbles in the box.\n\nA quick way to do this is to count the red, blue, green, and yellow marbles separately. \nHere is how we can do that:\nNote that we can count how many there are in each color by reading off the columns: marbles of a specific color. Here's how:\n<pre>\nf   f\nf - f\nf  - f\n\n0  1  1  2  3  3  4  4  5  5  6\n1  1  2 - 3 - 3  6  8  9  11\n2  3  4  5 - 6 - 9  12 14  17\n3  5  8  9   - 12 16  20 24  30\n4  7 12 14 17 20   - 25 30  36\n\n </pre>\n\nThere's more than one way to write the table of marbles' colors, as seen in the previous section.\n\n\nStep 2: When we compare the total of 30 against how many of that color are \"different\" by subtracting the colors of those we counted from 30, we find that the marbles of a different color are 13. For example if we subtract the column of 10, the result is 0-10 = 34, or 34marbles are left over. If we subtract the yellow marbles of the green marbles, the result is 20-10 =10. \n\nStep 3: What if we wanted to count the marbles of a specific number of a specific color?  For example, what if the total was 110 and we wanted to know how many of that color there were? We'll use a method that counts backward, instead of forward.\n\nIf you count backward from 0 to 10, you find that there are 3 of that color; if", "answer": " 88"}

If the response creates all the required items, you are done! If the condition is not met, continue with the next iteration of the loop until it does meet the condition. A response such as \"continue with the next iteration of loops, until condition\" should continue with the nesting loops until the condition is met.\n\n1.

{"text": "1.07127228 (or 1 minute and 7.127229 seconds).\n\n### Demostration:\nLet the ball be thrown and the clock (or whatever you're using as the distance/run) to start at the same time. In that case, when the ball is thrown the clock will be counting forward 1 second for every 5 feet that the dog is getting to the ball. The best way to figure the run time to the ball is to calculate total time (time to catch the ball), and subtract it from the total time to where the ball was thrown.\n\n### Solution 1:\nWhen the ball is thrown, the border collie is 20 feet away at the start and moving at 5 feet per second. In 1 second, it will travel 5 feet. In 1 minute, it travels 12 inches/sec. and will travel 12 x 60 = 720 (approx.) inches. At 720 seconds, the dog would be 240 feet (feel free to check, see if its close, and adjust the rest of the calculation; also, add a variable to store that number in for it'll be used later.)  From that point the dog will travel at 8 feet/second. That means that 8 x 60 seconds = 480 (approx.) feet will be travelled in 1 minute. Add all three (240 + 480 + 240 = 960 (approx.) feet) together and that's how many feet it takes for the dog to reach the ball.\n\n### I don't have too much experience with math, so if you see me slacking it off in my solution, please help me out.", "answer": " 32"}

Her daughter is 11 years old, and Maria finds it hard to understand how this could happen because her daughter always acted immature even as a baby. When she was born, Maria swore she saw something funny about her daughter, something like a smirk over her left shoulder, and she swore never to forget it.  She tried to tell her husband, but he swore he had never seen anything remotely funny about Maria\u2019s daughter, and then he began to suspect Maria of being \u201cobsessed\u201d or as he said, \"neurotic.\" Maria is now convinced that this strange thing she thought she saw in her daughter all those years ago was actually a sign that her daughter's condition would cause her to turn into a 11 years old child, so she cannot understand why her husband says her daughter is \"acting her age.\" Maria has to talk to him about his reaction; how should she proceed?

What is the largest three-digit number that is divisible evenly by 3? 2. Of all the evenly divisible three-digit numbers in this range, 6 may appear the most because it ends in six. This may seem confusing at first because this question doesn't address what the largest three-digit evenly divisible by 6 is. However, if you consider each digit of these numbers to be a set of three digits, then each digit is only divisible by 2 or 3. The answer is 819.  \n\nThe reason that 6 may seem like the answer is because it ends in six, making the digits appear smaller than they actually are. For example, six looks smaller than eight, even when they represent the same number, 8. However, when 8 is subtracted from 6, you get two ones. 819 is the largest three digit divisible by six because it has two ones at the beginning.\n\nAnswer: 819\n\n### Demos: [Demos: answer the following question.\n\n## Demos Answer the Following Question.]\n\nDemos: How Many Times Does \u201cNo\u201d Divide 704\n\n\n### Instructions\n\nDemos:The question is: How many times does \u201cNot\u201d divide ten?\n\nDemos:What can be implied from this question?\n\nDemos answer: This question is an example of word problems that often have to be simplified to become less challenging, as well as more difficult", "answer": " 2020"}

Calculate the number of sheets of paper that are used in a volume of 150 pages per short story per week.\n\n1. 50 pages per shortstory*4shortstories per week*52weeks (52 weeks in a year) = 425,000pages per year.\n\n2. Use the per-page calculations from the previous step to calculate the number of sheets of\npaper needed for one volume: 425000pages / 2pages per sheet = 212500 sheets of paper needed for one volume.\n\n3. There are 500 sheets per ream, therefore use the equation below to determine the number ofreams needed for a year:\n21250=5000500=21.25reams of paper needed for one year of work.\n\n4.

The first one is X cm and the other one is 1 centimeter bigger. Let's name it Y centimeters. Therefore the base is (X+1) centimeter for this triangle that contains Zion's tower. \n\n**2**: Now we have to find the height of this tower. The height is 20 centimates. Since the base is (X-1) centimates, the result will be (X-1) + 20 which equals (X-1) 21 centimates.\n\n**3**: Now let us find out what is the height for the second model. It should also have (X-1) cm. \n\n**4**: The rest is simple. The sides are 21x21 for the first triangle and 20x21 for the second triangle. Therefore, the area of the first triangle is 21*21 and the second one is 20*21 because it has a smaller height. \n\n**5**: We are now going to simplify the process further. Let's name (X-1) - 20 as Y centimates. We have Y+21 centimates - 1 for the fist triangle and Y+20 -1 centimates for the second triangle. \n\n**6**: Since X-1+20 equals X+1, X is 31 centimates.

Since 70 minutes is between 40 and 80 minutes, the answer is C: 50 minutes.\n### Rationales:\n1. Treys list consisted of 7 tasks to accomplish. Each task took 10 minutes to complete. To find the total minutes it takes to finish the list, we break down the time needed for each item.\n2. We start by adding 70 minutes (total time it takes to complete the list of 7 tasks) then subtract 70 minutes (the total time it takes to complete 7 tasks).

There are other options. However, 10 minutes to each task does not add up to a whole hour, so the total will be closer to an hour instead of 50.\n\n5.

{"text": "He has a total of 30 fruits\n\n#### Instruction:Answer the folloing question.\n\n#### Demonstration:John has three children and is shopping for children's clothing. If he can buy a hat and a scarf for $7.50 or a hat and a scar and a pink parka for $12.50, which option should John choose if the pink parka, which he has seen many times, is on sale for $4 and he wants to spend no more than $14.10 on all three articles of clothing?\n\n####Rationales:\n\n1. The question is asking whether John should buy a hat and a pair of mittens with an initial outlay of $7.50, or go for three items with an initial outlay, totaling $14.1.\n2. We can answer the question by assuming 1) John is buying two more items, 2) these three items are the only possible options John can buy, 3) he will not be buying the pink parka because it's on sale, and 4) he will not have any change from $14.1 when he is done shopping.\n3. We can easily answer the question by identifying the total cost for buying two items for $7.5, which comes to $7.5 + $7.5 = $15.0.\n4. Similarly, we can identify the total cost for bu ying three items for $14.1, which comes to $12.5 + $12.5+$4= $29.0.\n5. Since we have three items, and John wants to spend no more that that $14.1 on all of the items, but he will have no change when he is done shooping, it means that the sum of all the items costs must be less than $14.\n6. Therefore the answer is that John can only buy the hat and the mittens for $15.0\n\n####Answer:John should buy the hat and the mitten for $15.\n\n### [Instruction] Answer the following math question.\n\n####Demonstration:\n\n### [Input]: How many dollars are in $523.65.\n\n####Rationale:", "answer": " 80"}

The women total to 15 (three multiplied by 5) as they were purchased the most amount of apples out of the others.\n3. Subtracting the women's total from the total sum of all the apples, 76 is left over.\n4. The women had a total of 15 less than the total of the two men (30), and the men only had a total of 72 or 5 less than the total.\n5. We are left with a total of 76 apples being the one of the options in the question.\n6. This means either 76 or 99 apples and it is the only logical answer as the remainder is too large.\n7. Therefore, 76 apples was the answer.\n\n### Input : A certain store sold exactly twice as many oranges as it sold apples. If the number of oranges sold is 1565 and the number of apples sold is ten times what fewer, at most 39 fewer oranges were sold than what fewer apples were sold. What is the number of apples and oranges sold?\n\n### Rationale : This question is a two-in-one and a few different variables have to be set first. \n1. We know that oranges and apples are being sold twice as many from the question, because when we multiply a number twice, the product is fourfold. Oranges sold twice as many as apples sold is two four. \n2. Also, 1565 is the products of 2 and 782. So we can assume that the total apples in the first number is 782, the first digit in the second number is the amount of apples in the first digit, the second digit is the amount of appples in the second digit.\n3. For the amount of apples, I assume we have 15 apples in our total number.\n4. If 15 apples were being sold for all of them, 15 *", "answer": " 210"}

{"text": "The average of their average is to run about 2 miles per day in total.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. What is running an average? An average can be defined as the middle number when listing numbers in sequence.\n2. Since running an average refers to a process, what is the method of running an average that is asked? One cannot run an average, but rather run for an average (meaning they run for a specific distance) and then divide the distance by the number of days taken to run it, which is what the question asks them to do.\n3. Running an average is a way of describing how many miles per day have to be run in total, not the average daily miles of each runner.\n4. When given the distance to be travelled, we can express the total mileage they will have to run as follows: total miles= (30- 10) / 4 =15.\n5. Each runner has to run an average of 2.25 miles over the final 3 days, not the average daily run of each individual.\n6. The average of the average is the total miles between Jesse and Mia divided by 4 or1.25 miles each.\n7. They have to run a total of 15 miles, which is equivalent to running 3.75 miles per day on average.\n8. The average of their average is about 3.75 per person.\nANSWER: Average of their average is 3.75\n\n### Input : I've seen some of your work.\n\n### Response  : It is too humorous to remain serious, and it should be.\n\n### Explanation  :\n\n1.

There are two options: humorous or serious.\n\n4. However, not all the humorous are serious. There may be some that are too serious to be humorous.\n\n5. Since the definition of humorous is too funny, we can define too humorous like this.\n\n6. For a thing to be humorous too is that it is humorous too much.\n\n7. What is humorous too much?

{"text": "1. Start by identifiying the information you have:\nJames is a professor who has been teaching for 40 years.\nHis partner, who is also a professor, has been teaching for 30 years.\n2. Both partners have similar teaching experiences that may not add up.\n3. Therefore you need to find a way to combine their respective experience into one value.\n4. You can combine years using multiplication: 40x30+10=130 years, or 30x40+10= 130 years.\n5. Multiplying the numbers yields the same final number.\n6. Option A: careful is not the correct choice as their teaching experience was not that different and there was no way they could have been more careful in their years as professors.\n7. Option B: thought is not the correct choice because neither person was being thoughtful. You can't combine teaching experiences using thinking skills.\n8. Option C: complete was the first available option that would fit. However, it does not mean they were being thorough in their teaching, and not being thorough was one of the things that the question indicated.\n9.

So we know that 22 - 8 = 14 beakers don\u2019t have copper ions. \n\nI need to know how many beakers I need to test in order to find 45 drops without copper ions. To test 45 drops, I need to use 45 drops plus 25 more. So I have to find the number of drops I would use to test 25 more beakers.\n\nFrom here, I will simply subtract the drops I have already used by 25 from how many I will need total to test all 14 beakers (45 + 25), and I will end up with 40+.\n\nSo to test 25 extra beakers it will cost me 45 + 2 + 25.\n\nI know that 45 + 60 = 105 and 40 + 25 = 65, so now we will subtract 65 - 105 = -40.\n\nSo from this and some simple math, I will see that I have to test 35 beakers (45+25) before I can test 14 more beakers.\nSo to find out how many beakers I have already tested, I need to divide 22 + 14 + 35 = 71 by 35.\n\n71 \u00f7 35 =2.03 or 2.04.\n\nSo 25 of the 35 remaining beakers will contain copper when tested. From this, we can conclude that 22 beakers have copper in them (1/14 or 7.14%).", "answer": " 7"}

The information provided in the question relates to individual mink skins and the number of minks available, the number of mink babies. The third level includes the fraction of minks set free.\n4. Each subsequent level increases the level of detail which includes the number of babies born, the percent of overall minks that were not caught, and the overall number of minks.

Therefore, after four amoethae to have gone through four fissions, we have 16 amoetes, which took four days.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Fission is a method of reproduction for amoebae.\n2. The question states \"It takes four days for one amoethae to reproduce to 12 amothea.\"\n3. This can be found by multiplying 1 by 2, which leaves us with 2 then multiplying by 2 more, which would be 4.\n4.

The original sentence starts off with the question \"What is more, to\", which indicates it is asking a question. This sentence is also rhetorical because the question is asking a question the answer to which is known. In other words, it's a rhetorical device to make a statement. As stated in lesson, questions are used as rhetorical devices to convey a message in one way or another. \n\n2. Next, we should identify the problem as stated in the question. The sentence implies that the author would like to not hear about the mishegoss described in the first sentence.

Notice that Andy gained 36 pounds and grew 3 inches - this is because his new weight is 36 pounds greater than his old weight and his new height is 3 inches greater than his old height, thus his new weight is 49lbs and his new height is at 3 inches greater than 158 inches long.\n3. Since Andy wants to lose weight, he has to lose 36 pounds to achieve his goal of losing one quarter of his starting weight.

Because she read 96 pages per every day and a book has 180 pages, then in two weeks the most number of pages you can get with 96 pages is 100 or 17.

{"text": "Demonstration:\nLet's begin by drawing a picture for our answer.  Suppose we start with t lions 0 rhinos, and after two hours the lions and rhinos are all caught again.  So we have:  t lions 0 lions + t rhinos 0 rhinos.   Add t lions and t rhinos, and we get t lions + (t rhinos + 2)\n\nSince t = 3 and 2 rhinos were added, we get t rhinos 2. Our second step is to turn this into hours.  We can assume that the  rhino recovery operation takes the same amount of time as a lion, so we can cancel out the t rhinos 2 and get 2 x 2 = 4 hours, and so the total time recovering animals is 16 hours.\n\n### Input4 lions and 3 rhinos escape from the  zoo.  If it costs $40 to feed an animal each how much will it cost to feed the recovered  animals?\n\n## # Input4 lions and  3rhinos escape from the \nzow  If itcosts \n$40 to feed ananimaldeliverly 40 x 7  = $280\nhoused\n\n### Response\nDemonstration\nThis answer is going to be complicated in words because we need to factor in the cost to recover each animal.  There are two main possibilities. We can factor in the cost of feeding animals at the zoo as well as cost to recover the animals, or we don't make this distinction and just consider each recovery as a separate operation.\n\nIf we include the cost of recovering animals, the cost is $40 (cost of each animal for 7 days) for each recovered animal times the number of recovered animals.   The total cost of all animals is $40 x t lions 6 = $240 and $40 x (t rhinos -  2) = $80.\n\nThe second alternative is if the recovered animals will be returned to the zoo without paying the $40 for feeding each animal. In this case the cost of recovery is $40(7 days * 2) = $120\n\nThe answer is the difference between these two options. $120 - $2", "answer": " 10"}

The first part of the second part is still the second part (\"the first of the second part\"). \n\n### Input :\"He is always in a good mood.\"\n### Response :\"He has no bad mood.\"\n## Rationale:\n(1) Moods are by nature comparative. We would not say someone is in a bad mood, unless that same person can also be considered to be in a good mood. This is especially true when we use the word \"always\" (\"He is always in a great mood\" or \"He is always in an excellent mood\").\n(2) Therefore the given sentence does not make any logical sense.\n\n### Answer:\"The second part of the first part of a two parter.\"\n\n### Note\n1. A question may contain two or more parts (e. g. \"The first part of the second question is \"How?\"). Such question may be called \"two parter\".\n2. The \"first part of a two parters\" would be the part preceding the second parter. So, \"the first part of a twoparter\" is not the same as \"the first part of two parter\".\n3. In many cases, \"the second part of a two partern\" would also be called \"the second part of the two parter'.\n4.

{"text": "Rylee was bored and decided to count the number of falling leaves in her backyard. She noticed that the first hour she tallied 7. Then, the rate for the second and third hour was 4 each.\n\n| Time       | Number of Leaves      |\n|:-----------|:---------------------|\n| Hour 1      | 7                     |\n| Hour 2      | 4                     |\n| Total Leaves| 54\n\nThere are a few easy ways to arrive at this, one of them being simply to divide `54` by the `2` hours, that is, `54/2`. But that requires the `0.25` result to be rounded to whatever unit you want. An alternative, I think a cleaner one, is to take our average rate of 4 per `hour` and apply it to the 4th hour, thus, multiplying the `54` above by `4` and dividing by `4`:\n\n    Average Leaves/Hour = (4/1 (4)) * 54 / 4 = 14\n    \n\nNot too long ago, I gave a [problem set](https://gist.github.com/chrisalbon/66ddbc44aed96613ddef8118673714d3) to a [friend](http://www.codecademy.com/chris_albon) of mine and asked him to solve it.

Since each bag was marked down to a $4.00 at $5.00/6.00= 83% markup, this means we have to multiply $3.00 by $6.00 to get how much she has in total sale and this is equal to $3.00*15.  Also, the cost of goods sold equals the cost of the ingredients that are needed to make the product or the cost of the product itself and in this case, to get the cost of goods sold we take the $45.0 from the total sales and divide it by the total number of bags which is equal to 15.  The final conclusion is as below that when there is a more than 100% markup, this can result in higher profit. So, Eliza's total profit is $35 and the markup on cost is equal to $3/35.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}cost~of~goods~sold~&={cost~of~ingredients} \\times~number~of~bags \\\\ cost~of~goods ~sold&={3} \\times~5 \\\\ cost~of~g~sold & =5 \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\n$$\\begin {aligned}markup~on~cost&=\\frac{Profit}{cost~of~good's~sold} \\\\ markup~on~cost~&=\\frac{3}{5} \\\\ markup~on ~cost&=", "answer": " 50"}

(2 \u00d7 60) - (4 \u00d7 T) = 120 -T\n\nNow, it's time to add all the values we know:\n\n6. Tom swims for 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 hours\n\n7. Then, Tom runs for 4 / T = 4/T/1\n\n8. Next, we subtract all the values:\n\n9. 4 \u00d7 60 - (4 \u00d7 T)/1 = 120-4/1 = 119\n\n10. Finally, the answer is: 119", "answer": " 12"}

If you want to unlock the safe for the key, you need to multiply it by twenty percent. Now, consider the key. To open the safe, you must first multiply it by a factor of twenty. But how do you calculate the factor of twenty? The key is a fraction. If you multiply it by one third, you will get one hundred twenty. If you multiply it again by four, you will get eight hundred fifty-five. And if you multiply it again by five, you will get forty-thousand. So, to open a safe, you must multiply the key by fifty percent. This is not a difficult problem to solve as you can see by the solution below. There are a number of ways to solve this problem but we recommend the approach outlined in the next section.\\n\\n\\nSolution to Opening a Safe. There are a number if ways to open a safe.

For sum, a positive number is added to a negative number, and a negative number is added to a positive number. For subtraction, a positive number is subtracted from a positive number, a negative number is added, and a negative number subtracted from a positive one. For example, in the question, we use addition. We add ages, so we use positive numbers.\n\nWhen using positive and negative numbers, take the addition of the positive numbers (the first 2 ages) and use it. We add Tyson's age to Frederick's to get the second sum, and use that number to add and subtract. This is used so there aren't extra numbers added or subtracted that weren't present in the original question.\n\nOne should also note that when you are adding or subtracting ages, the question asks to calculate the value of the original one. Therefore, a positive number cannot be added to a negative number because negative numbers must be in the sum, as well as the original.\n\n### Explanations:\n\nAnswer: The input is given:\n\n- Frederick is 2 times Older than Tyson.\n- Frederick is 5 years older then Julian.\n- Julian is 20 year's younger than Frederick.\n\nWe must fill in the missing numbers to complete the question, and we can get the information by either adding and subtracting the age differences:\n\nFrom the second rule for sum, we know since Frederick is 5 years old than Julian, we can use the sum: 5 (The oldest person +", "answer": " 25"}

The following information is given: \n1. Michonne is inviting 6 friends from school, 12 from her neighborhood.\n2. Each of her friends asked if they can bring 2 friends in total.\n3. That means Michonne asked a total of 60 friends to bring two friends totaling the number 120.\n4. Then, the question asks us to find the number of people going on Michonnes' birthday party.\nNow that you found the total number of 120 people going to Michonnes' birthday, use multiplication to find the answer.\n5. Divide the question numbers by the number of friends that Michonne brought for the calculation of the sum since you cannot just multiply these numbers directly.\n\nIn this case, it is 120 divided by 14.\n6.

We see that there are 16 lawn services but only 3 customers to give a $10 tip to each.\n3. We know from the numbers that the total dollar amount given to Lee was $84 plus 8 times $10, a total of $2284 was given.\n4. We can then conclude that the total number of lawn mowing services given (16) multiplied by the number of $10 tips (8) equals a total of $2088, leaving a few dollars left to be deducted.\n5. We can now narrow it down to the total amount earned based on total lawn services plus total tip divided by the number of lawn services mowed, the final answer is $33 since the amount earned for 1 lawn equals $33 and there were 16 \nservices,  total of $538 + $2088 / 16=$33 \nAnswer: $33 for 1 lawn\n\n### Input:\"I am what I am\",  and you are what you are.

The question states the team of five people should use all their capacity to move the office desk. \n2.

If all five work together, the 10-second duration each person is capable of lifting the desk will be multiplied by five, which totals over 400 seconds.  But since they can only pick it up for 10 seconds at a time, they could only do five turns per person and 10 times five is 50 seconds, which is over 100 seconds more than they need.\n5.

Start by reviewing the information given in the prompt. \n2. Joe is making 5 times what Bill is earning.\n3. Joe is making 1 less than 3 times that rate times the rate of Mike.\n4. 3 times the rate of Mike, plus 1, must equal his total rate; therefore, Mike must be earning $0.0625.\n5. The difference between Joe's rate and Mike's rate, which is Mike's rate minus $0.06 per year, equals Bill.\n6. Bill must be earning $6.50.\n7. 5 times that rate is how much, and 3 times that rate is how many times that.\n8. Five times the total is more than three times the total, so $5 per year is more than 3 times $0.06, so $5 less than 3 times $1.50 must be the exact amount.\n9.

However, this is only possible if Anne is 10.\n- Therefore, we can solve the initial question by plugging Anne's age = 10 into the equation:\nBy the time Anne is a time as old of Emile, Emile is 6 times old enough than 10.\n  - This statement is true because the rightmost number, Anne's age, is always a multiple of Emile's age.\n  - We may also use 19 for Anne's age for convenience. Anne's age = Maude is 10 + 19\n  - Emile = Maude - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4\n- Emile is equal to 4. Therefore, Emile will be Emile years old when Maude will be Emile.\n  1. Emily is 2 Emile\n   1.

If Maude's age is 8, then Anne will be Maude's age - Emile's age is Anne's age + Emile's age = 6 \n   2. Anne's age is Emily's age - Emiley's age = 2 - 2 = 28\n  - We know Emile's and Maude's age because Maude is Emile = 6, and Emile + Emile = Maude therefore Anne will be 26.\n\n- Therefore, Anne will be years old in the future", "answer": " 96"}

This means Larry has a height of lower than 5 feet and 7 inches but greater than 4 feet and 3.5 inches in relation to the tree.\n2.

For our problem, there are 3 choices, and each person can take either the drinks and/or the soda.\n   - So we can use 3 cases to solve our problem.\n2. Compute for each case.\n   - With 3 cases, the number of people who attended under different conditions is calculated. For example, in case 46 (in which the first choice is 26; the second choice is 22; and the third choice is 17), the number of people at each case is 46 (all options combined).\n   - Once the different cases are computed, you can compute for the total number of people who attended. This is the total number of people in all the different cases.\n3. Get the Grand Total.\n   - All different cases computed should have the same total number of people. This is our grand total.\n   - To be more accurate, our grand total should be based on the sum of the product of all the elements involved in a choice. For example, the product of 2, 4, 7 is 84.

The time is 1 hour only. In one hour they traveled 20km east at 30km/hr. That means the boat traveled 400km east at 1/3 speed.

{"text": "The question asks about the number of boats that can race in the river. The river has cross-side of 42 feet, which implies a length of 84 feet. The boats (each 3 feet wide) have a length of at least 2 feet from the riverbanks. The boats must have a minimum distance of 2 feet from each other to race.\n\nSince a boat's length is 3 feet and the boats must be at least 2 feet apart, we can use 1.5 feet to estimate at least the width of the river for boat lengths of 3 feet in total length. \nThe length cannot go beyond 42 feet because if the length does go past 42 feet, then the boats will have less than 2 feet between them and they will crash against each other (the boats will then collide).\n\n20.5 42^2 + 2^2 = 84 feet\n\n20.25 > 42\n\nTherefore, the boats cannot race on the river since there is less than 2 feet of room between each boat when at least a 2-foot width is needed for the boat race.\n\nThe minimum number of boats must race on the river is greater than or equal to 20.\n\nThe river can have approximately 20 boats race.\n\nAnswer: The minimum number of boats on the river is approximately 20.", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "This is an Arithmetic word problem, which is a multiple-step problem that requires the use of arithmetic operations. The first step in solving an arithmetic word problem is to identify the problem itself. In this problem, we are looking at the amount of money James would get paid for the week based on the average number of points he scored in each game. This gives us the equation:\n\nScoring = Total Earnings\n\nWhere,\n\nScore = [((2*No. of games played)*Points he scored in each game)]\n\nTotal Earnings = 10,00 $ + [((2*No of games played)(P- 30)]\n\nFor Scoring = Total Earnings, we are given the range of points he scored.\n\nThe points he scores for the week = (30,28,32,34,26)\n\nFor Total Earnings, the points he scores for the entire week(30+28+32+34+26) = 3-0\n\nSince no other information is given regarding the points James scored in the extra games, we can assume that he scored 30 in each additional game. Which means that the points he scored for the week = (90, 28, 32, 34, 26), but we already have these values from the 5th and 6th game. So we can only include those three extra games in this equation.\n\nThe points James scores for the week = 30(3) + 28(3) + 32(3) + 90(3) +26(3) = 30(9) + 28 (9) 3,2 (9) + 990 = 11 ( 56)\n\nFinally, in the Scoring part of the equation, the points he scores in the fifth game = 26, and the points he scores in all the other games = (30, 32,34).\n\nTherefore the points he scores for week = 26.3 + 30.3 + 323 + 990*0.3 +263 = 11 + (90+12+34)0.3= 4 + 11", "answer": " 10,000"}

The cage was not guarded, and the lion could have moved into another room at any time.\n\n### Response : Since the lion was in the same cage at different times, it must have remained in the same spot at least once. When the lion was in its cage, a zoo employee could have found the animal between the two times that it was \nin the cage. From 2:21 to 5 PM is 2.5 hours. From 5 to around 7:25 PM is 2 hours and 24 minutes.

However, the second function takes in the value for level above the parameter and multiplies it by that number to find a value.

The total fine for Mark's speeding ticket would not be equal to the base fine (which is usually more than the first additional penalty) due to these other penalties.\nFirst step to find the answer is to calculate the base fine.\nThe base fine for the speeding ticket was $50. The speeding fine should be doubled because Mark was caught speeding in a school zone. Therefore the base fine would be $100.\nThe base fine was further increased by $2 because Mark was over the speeding limit by 45 miles per hour. This would make the total base fine $ 119, due to the increases of $2 for each mile per hour over the limit.\nStep 2: Add other penalties for the ticket.\nThe additional penalty for each mile per hour would have to be added.\nMark was speeding at 75 miles per hours over the speed limit. Therefore the total additional penalties for speeding is $ 260, due to the increases by $2 for each miles over the speed limit.\nStep 3: Add $300 costs and $80 per hour legal bill costs.\nMark also has to pay the $300 cost and $80 for his legal bill for three hours of work, which is a total of $240.\nThe total fine of the speeding ticket is $800, including the base fine, base fine increase, additional penalty for exceeding speed limit and cost for the legal bill and the costs.\n\n\nAnswer: $ 800", "answer": " 820"}

What type of customer does not have a say in their taste preference for a sweet? Choices:  a: a healthy b: a picky c: a rich d: a frugal e: a satisfied f: a picky g: a satisfied\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Flavors are part of sweet treats.\n2. But certain flavors can be an unpleasant surprise and are only for certain customers.\n3. The owner doesn't have any other specific preferences regarding flavor.\n4. The only rule at the shop is \"no sweets without the frosting\" so the store owner is not concerned about other preferences.\n5. Only healthy people don't have a say in their flavor preferences, because a healthy person may be picky about flavor.\n6. So answer choice D, frugal, is incorrect: people who aren't picky don't care about cost.\n7. An inexpensive treat is only for someone who is picky (doesn't mind what it tastes like but is concerned with the price). \n8. Therefore, the best answer is F: a satisfied person.  Healthy people have no special preference for their sweet foods.\n9. They also wouldn't be rich, because a healthy lifestyle is associated with saving money and an expensive sweet wouldn't fit.\n10. They wouldn't be frugal either, because healthy people are concerned with their health.\n11.

There will always be 4 apartments on each floor, one of which can accommodate 4 individuals.\n3. Each person has their own unique space to live in.\n4.

Therefore 25 - 75 = 50 people did not come to the restaurant and have coffee.\n5. 3/5 of 25 equals 75.\n6. 3/5 is the coefficient of \"75.\"\n7. Therefore, there are 50 people that didn't drink coffee + 25 = 50 + 25 = (25 people that didn't buy coffee) + (25 people that came to eat and drink).\n8. 50 is the total number of people present in the restaurant and 25 is the total number of customers who drank coffee with their meal.\n9.\tTherefore, 50- (25= 25-75+75)\n10.\tAnd, since the negative sign denotes subtraction, the total amount of people that did not buy coffee is given by 50-25= 24 people.\n\n### Rationale:\n1.

{"text": "The height h of the computer screen is determined by the formula h = p - 2r, from what we know about the formula p=2r+2l, where p is the perimeter of the square, and r and l are the length of the side and the length of the hypotenuse, respectively. (The hypotenuse is the opposite side to the length on the side of the square.)\nSo, what we want to know is: h = 2p - 2 (2r+2l) = 2p - (2r-r) = 2p-r = 2p - r. (For all squares p = 4r+2l.)\nThe perimeter of the square is 20 cm less than the height of the screen, so p-r=20. This means that the screen's height h is 20 cm.\n\nAnswer:\nRationales:\n1. We know what the perimeter of a square is from the given information.\n2. We also know that the height of the square is the perimeter of length 20 cm less, which yields the formula for a regular square.\n3. The problem involves finding the height h of a computer screen with the same formula.\n4. We can then solve for h.\n5.

These steps are 1.) identifying the problem, 2.) generating ideas to solve the problem, and 3.) developing a plan to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the Problem\nThe problem is to find the total amount Jean gives each grandchild, thus her grandchildren's total gift.\n\n###  Step 2: Generating Ideas to Solve the Problem\nThe process of generating ideas involves brainstorming ways to solve the problem and creating a plan to accomplish the task. Here are a few strategies to assist in brainstorming ideas:\n\n1. Consider different approaches: Think critically about various methods for solving the problem and assess their effectiveness. This may involve researching or asking for help from others for more ideas.\n\n2. Break the problem down into smaller parts: Instead of trying to solve the entire problem at once, it may be helpful to break it down into smaller parts that are easier to tackle.\n\n3. Brainstorm with a partner: Collaborating with someone else can help generate new and unbiased perspectives on the task. This partner can offer potential solutions and insight that may not have occurred to you alone.\n\nIt's important to remember that generating ideas is not limited to these methods but includes any strategy that helps to develop a plan. It is also vital to take frequent breaks and step away from the task to allow for fresh thoughts and perspectives.\n\n###Step 3: Devise a plan\nIt is necessary to identify the problem and generate different solutions to solve it.\nThe given problem is: Jean has 3 grandchildren, and she gives each $80 in each of 2 cards a year. How much does she give each child?\nOne solution can be stated as:\n\nJean gives each of her 3 grandchildren a total of $120 a year, or $2 a week per grandchild.\n\nTherefore, for these 3 grandchildren, Jean has a total of 60 weeks in the year and gives each child $2 a week or a total gift of $120 (six times twenty).

We must chose B: thoughtful because it explains most eloquently.\n\n* Option D: thorough- this fits best as it point to an in-depth an detalied examenation, which would have almost certainly uncovered the real cuse of the decece.\n\n* Option E: intricate- this does fit slightly because John did look in detail but even in this option we must eliminate the answer since it is not the specifics of the examenation that should have revealed the cause of death.\n\n* Therefore, the best option for answering this question", "answer": " 2475"}

On October 31, 2006, Dove presented the government firm with a bid to buy the property for $86.25 million. The owner of the real estate firm is an entrepreneur who has bought several properties under the 2000 Farm Bill and has made a profit by reselling most of them. When he was asked to estimate the value of the property, the firm presented a market analysis that indicated the property\u2019s value was below $34.4 million. If the owner\u2019s bid is accepted, a decision will be made to hire the Dove Real Estation firm to manage the property.\n\n### Answer:\n\n1.

{"text": "14 wheels\n\n### Explanation:\nIn his neighborhood, all the trucks have 4 wheels, and all the cars have 4 wheels as well.\n\n### Input and Explanation:\n\nThis question is asking for the day of the week on March 17, 2022.\n\n### How to determine it:\n1. March 17,2022 is a Thursday.\n2. Going back in time the day of the week of March 17,1922 was a Saturday. Going forward in time the day was a Thursday as it's the day we are asking about.\n3. March 17 was a Thursday until March 18.\n4. As we do not know the answer before or after the week of Mar 17, 1922 it must be a Thursday. Therefore, the answer is Thursday. The reason is that the question did not specify the day of the week for the year and only when one must do a mathematical calculation using dates to see the day of the week. \n5. If one were to use March 17,  1922 as a date in a question that had no dates after the answer would be a Friday as it went from December 30,2021 to December 31th,2021 or January 1st,2022 depending on which calculation method one chooses to do but the day of the week stayed the same for the calculation or question. \n6. An example would be \"Tommy decides to calculate how old he is on March 17th\", one could calculate the exact years, months and days he/she has been alive, if it has gone past midnight, the day is a Saturday, but if not the day until it would be a Sunday. If one asks for only the day of the week and not the age or years, months or days alive they would have to use March 18th as it went from March 17th to March 18th.\n### Input:John goes for a walk around his neighborhood, he sees 11 houses that are two story houses, and 14 houses that are one story houses.

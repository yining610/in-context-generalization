{"text": "A: We do not yet have enough information to find out the percentage of trout caught and the number remaining. If we knew these numbers, we could then work the formula 0.15(T+r)=60 to solve for r=7; then, r=7 or r+T=7; so, r=T+6 and so on, until we come to the following equation: 0.65(T+6)=60 T=13. So, Bucky needs to save $13 more to get the game.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe problem gives us the information that Bucky can earn $5/fish from trout and $0.4/fish from blue-gill fish. We do not know the percentages of trout caught and blue-gilled caught, so we have too-little information to solve the problem at this point. After finding the percentage, we may recreate the same method by first writing 0.65t=60 which is 65% and 0.15=15%\n\nWe may now rewrite our equation as 0.65T + 0.15R = 60 because our goal is to find R. This means that blue-gills + R will make up 65% of all fish caught, and trout will be left with 15%, so R (blue-gills) = {(0.15)1} + R = {0.15}T + R. R = 0.15T + T = 0.25 or 0.25T = T, or T=4.\n\nThus, to find R, we must substitute to get blue-gills = R+ 5 or B= R+ 5. Again, to find R, substitute back into equation 0.15TR which is 0.25R, then solve for R by multiplying both sides by T. We get R=7.\n\nWe are now left with T=13 and so the percentages of the two fish are found to be 65:35. Since our goal is to find for how long Bucky must save, we may now rewrite 0.65 (B+R)=60 to solve R=62.50. This means he must", "answer": " 2"}

Sam ran 12 miles, but he ran less miles than Harvey did, so he didn't run as many miles as he did the first time. So he didn't run 12 miles this time, so he only ran 8 miles.

{"text": "First let\u2019s convert the percentages to decimal to make it easier to solve.\n\n40% - 0.4 = 0.6\n\n1/4 - 0.25 = 0.75\n\nThe total percentage of what\u2019s left is now just 0.6 + 0.75 which is 1.05, if we round down this is just 1, so the total percentage Lenny is given is 1\n\n40/1.05 = 37.6379\n\n40 pens Lenny will be given to friends and the rest is given to classmates making the final count of what\u2019s left 50 pens\n\nSo the final count is 50 pens - 40 pens from Lenny\u2019s friend = 10 pens\n\n### Input  : I am looking to rent an automobile. I want something reliable, with air conditioning and not too old because I plan on driving it for several weeks. How much should I expect to pay?\n\n### Demostration:\n\nGiven the answers, I understand you are looking to rent anything with the following: 1: reliable, with air condition + 2: not too old + 3: driving it for 3 week/s.\n\n* 1:\n\nReliable = any car with more than 50000 miles\n\nAny car not older than 10 years old or 100000 miles:\n\nSo we can conclude, the only reliable car with air conditioning without being too old is an 2015-2018 Toyota Camry or Camry Hybrid. They are more then 5000 miles, 10 years old but the engine is still reliable and it can be easily found at your local car rental place. The price of hiring it for one week is $100, since you are planning on driving it for 3 weeks, you will be charged for 1 week + 2 weeks, which is $200 or $100 times 2 weeks.\n\n* 2:\n\nNot too old = 10 years old\n\nNot too old + = 1000 miles\nThe maximum mileage that can be driven is 100,000", "answer": " 45"}

I saw a container of apple sauce in the refrigerator, but there was this strange brown liquid in the container. I knew it wasn't apple sauce, but I didn't know what else it could be. I was at a loss because I had been making apple sauce ever since I was an apple sauce maker. I was looking for something that was made with apple sauce, but instead of it being apple sauce, there was this strange brown sludge in the refrigerate. So I looked at it again, and then I realized that the strange brown liquid was the result of being made with apple sauce. In other words, we had made a new recipe with apple sauce. That's what the strange brown sludge was all about.\n\n###Input:What type of beverage can one expect to see at the movies?\n\n###Demo:\nInput: What type of beverage can be expected at movies?\n\nAnswer: The beverage can be expected to be served at movies and at the movies of other types of events as well.\n\nInput: At the movies\n\nInput: It can be expected that the movie can be expected to be expected to contain, but it's not that bad to be expected.

{"text": "7.864\n\n### Rationale:  We need to figure out how many cubic feet are in the aquarium with just the top layer of water. Water weighs 62 lbs per cubic foot, but 32% of that amount is dissolved in the water. A cubic foot of fresh water is equivalent to 1,798 oz. Divide that by 32 and the you will get ~60 oz per cubic foot of water in an aquarium. A little under 2 cu ft of water is 60 oz or 1548g. Multiply 1.548 by 16 cu ft and the answer will be 25.032 cu ft. The rest of the water (which Nancy put in tripled the amount) is going to weigh 77.236 lb or 0.485 cu ft.\n\nThe math is not exactly correct, but it is close.

{"text": "The card Buddy has on Thursday is the sum of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, so the solution is 30+12+12=66\n\n### Difficulty:\nDifficult\n### Explanation:\nIn this problem we are given what would be considered a complex set of information. \nWe start off with 30 cards and lose half of them; then gain 12 new cards, and we end with 66 cards total.\nBecause we have already lost some of our cards and then gained more later, we have to determine all of the steps of what happened along the way to get us 66 cards.\nWhen a problem like this comes up, we can determine what information to use by using the data given within the question.\nIn this problem, Buddy loses half his cards and then gains more, so we know this has to start with 30 cards, we will lose 30/2(half of 30)= 15 and we will gain 12 new.\nAfter our data is determined we can use it to form a chart and organize it by columns with the number of cards, and rows with the dates; columns with the amount gained or lost to determine the information we want.\nAfter our data has been organized we can begin to create equations to come up with the information we are asking; for example Monday is 30 cards, Tuesday is going to be (15+3)/2 which is 12, Wednesday is 12, and for Thursday we will use 66+(12) since we already know that we are taking 12 and adding it to our 66 cards to get 66+12=78\nFrom this equation we can determine that Thursday is the final answer, and that Buddy started with 30 cards but gained 12 back which brought him to 66 cards total at the end of the week.\n\n**_Example of a response:_**\nThe card Buddy had on Monday was 30.\nOn Tuesday Buddy lost his cards during the half of what he had last Monday.\nAs a result, what Buddy had on Tuesday was (30/2)*15 = 12.\nOn Wednesday, Buddy", "answer": " 32"}

The boys had been studying hard all year for it, and they had taken many practice tests, but the day before the test arrived, they realized that they had forgotten how to solve a problem that was on their last practice test. They panicked, because the problem was on the test. But they relaxed a bit, because they had learned in math class that they shouldn't worry so much if it had been on their last practice test, because the test was designed to test them on things that they probably wouldn't have been taught yet since it was after Christmas and the year, so the test would just have things from throughout the year, including things on their last practice test and things that they had learned since the last practice test. How did the boys solve this problem, which concerned the difference between two numbers that they hadn't learned yet?\nresponse: they thought about all the options that they had available to them given the information they had and what they knew, including taking a guess, and they were able to solve it, so they were pleased with their work even if it wasn't a perfect score.\n\ninput:A man named Mark was playing the lottery, and he picked his numbers using a random number generator.

But Mark himself had an incredibly complex, beautiful, and very specific mathematical theory that suggested that it was likely true that this was not a mere accident and that there was actually only one randomization function that was more likely to produce a winning lottery combination than the other ones.

So if the income is $200, 000, then:  $200,500 - $100 = $199,400 and $199,500 - 100 = 198,500 so then we say that tuition is $2000. \n\n\n### Input and Response:\n\nInput: I was so excited about my new home and when I looked at the price tag, there were way more zeros than I could count.

Then, the last one would be 256 minus 184.\n### Input:Mr Jackson bought 142 cans of orange juice. He planned to give 40 cans to each of his five sons, each son except john took two more cans. He gave the remaining cans to the neighbor children. How many cans did he have left?\n### Response: He gave 20 plus what he had left. It\u2019s the same thing as subtracting 10 times 5. So, he should subtract 10 times 8 to the answer. So, subtract 80. That answer is subtract 80. The response to that is 80.\n### Input:(3x +4) - (4x-3)\n### Response: To solve for x we use the Subtraction Property of Equality with x. So, (3x - 4) - (4 - 3) x. So, it\u2019s just taking away the same amount of the equation (3x +4) as the equation. So, we do get x by subtracting 3 from both equations and then we just subtract the numbers.\n### Input:[523 - 11 * 6 ] +3\n### Response: In this equation, we\u2019re subtracting 6 times 6 from 523 or we\u2019re subtracting half of 6 to 30. What we need to do is find the difference between those. So, 593, the difference between the two numbers. Since it\u2019s adding you need the answer to that to find the answer. That is 338.\n### Input :Which of the following is not a way of expressing the mathematical relation between the quantities a and b?\n### Response:(a * b)/ 2", "answer": " 188"}

{"text": "The question states that the cap at the bottom is not very airt\ntight, meaning that the cap is not a perfect airtight fitting. Because the cap is not airtight all of the time it lets 1/30th of the water out constantly every minute. 1/30 of 120 is 4, so each minute, 1/30 (4/60) liter of water is lost. Now we have to figure out a way to calculate x/t, where x is the volume of water you started with, and t is the time it takes to fill to the top. To calculate the volume of the tub, we can divide 120 by 1 (because it is one bath)\nand the answer is 120.\n\nNow multiplying 120 by t (time in minutes) we get 120 t.\n\nUsing the formula above, since x/t is known by the question, so we can then substitute x/t for 120 t and we get 4x/t. Using the substitution method,\nthe x/t cancels out, since we already know the the x/t is in 4x/t, which leaves us with 4 times the x.\n\nNow multiping 4 times the x, we can get 1/4x. (4x-1/4x=4x, because 1 was canceled out, leaving only the 4x.)\n\nFinally calculating 5, because 1/4x=5, and the rest is math.\n\n### Reference:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_flow\nhttp://www.christophervamvounis.com/math-articles/sick-of-the-confines-of-your-tank-how-long-does-it-take-to-fill-up-a-bathtub-how-to-solve-a-leiden-flow-equation/\nhttps://www.quora.com/How-can-I-find-out-how-long-it-takes-to-fill-a-120-liter-tub-at-the-rate-of-1-liter-per-minute/answer/Christopher-Vamvounis", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "Answer:\nThere are\n* 15 classrooms\n* 75 desks\n* 5 desks per classroom\n* only 1 student is per desk.\n\nIn order to count, we need to be able to partition them. \n\nIn this case we can split them in half so that 8 is the total amount in each classroom. Next we need to find the number in each classroom. \n\nFor example in the first classroom the total that are partitioned there is 8/2 which can be broken down to 4/1 and 4/1. \n\nWhich means that 4 students will fit into each desk in classroom 1.\n\nThen we use a different amount of desks for a second classroom. Next each 8 are split so that the amount of total of each of the classrooms is 8. Then we can do 4/2 which yields to 2/1 and 2/1. \nWhich means that to fit into the 2nd classroom 2 students will fit into each of the 2 desks.\n\nDoing this same process, each classroom will have 2 students in each desk. All 15 classroom will have 10 student each. Therefore all students will get their own desk.\n\n### Credits\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mRr_UwHdE\n\n- https://www2.gsu.edu/~www_www/cs311s/lectures/classroom.pdf", "answer": " 400"}

{"text": "319\n\n### Rationale:  Let's first find out the final weight. The original weight of the box is 2 pounds so the current weight is three times the original one (2lbs x 3) thus the final weight.\nThe total weight of jelly beans and brownies is 7 lbs. The final weight contains both jelly beans and gummy worms. To get the final total weight of jelly bean and gummy worm, take the current weight and subtract 7 (as the total weight of jellybeans) and then add 3 (as the total weight for brownies).\n\\[2lbs*(3)+(3lbs)*(1)-7lbs=39-7=32lbs\\]\nHence, the final weight of the goods (gummy worm included) is 32.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nIn order to calculate the weight of the box of goods, one must consider the weight of the container, the weight of the goods in it, \nand the number of items in the container. First, one must determine the total weight of the container. \nThe container has an original amount of weight that was 2 pounds. Therefore, the current load added to the container is 3 times \nthe original weight, which is 6 pounds more. Now add the 6 pounds and then subtract 7 pounds because of the weight of the goods.\n\nThen one must find the amount of weight of the things put into the canister.  \nFirst, the amount of weight is (2 lbs x 3) which equals (6 lbs.)\nAdditionally, the weight of all the items is (7 lbs) which is the weight of all of the jelly bens and brownies. \nIf one adds (2 lbs x3) and subtracts (7 lbs) one gets (39 lbs):\n\\[2 lbs*(3)+(7lbs)-7lbs=2 lbs x3-7lbs=3 lbs x3=39 lbs\\]\n\nNext, one must determine how many of each items there are in the canister. \nThe weight of the box of mixed goods that contained only jelly bens and a few brownies had a total of (7 lbs) of weight. \nSub", "answer": " 16"}

So the program must multiply each integer by the respective index to get the product of the original list. We apply multiplication (a[i] * i) and then reduce it by 1 to account for the fact that each time, an integer counts for 1 less. In order to not lose the last integer, which is 1, we must subtract 1 at the end.\nIn the case of input A, we have to find how many weeks are in the summer.\nTo do this, we need to know what is a week in this application and how many hours in a day. The application tells us hours are used for days. We do not know exactly how often each hour is used.\nSuppose we know each hour is used on average three times. For every day of the week, we can figure out how many hours it used and each day has seven.\nSo we can calculate roughly how many hours each week has.\n```C++\nclass Solution\n{\npublic:\n    int Solution(int[] nums) {\n\n        for (int h : nums) {\n                days.insert(days.end(), h / 24);\n\n        }\n\n\n        for (const auto& f : days) {\n            m_weekdays[days[f]]++;\n        }\n        double hours = 7 * m_weekdays[1];\n\n        for (auto i = 2; i < 8; i++) {\n            hours += 7 * m_dayofweek[i];\n        }\n        return (hours / 7) + 1;\n    };\n    int operator()(int key) {\n        return m_weekdays[key] + m_weekdays[7];\n    }\n   std::unordered_map<int, double> m_weekdays;\n   std", "answer": " 9"}

What was the average amount of pizza's sold between 5:30am and noon on Saturday?\n\n### Solution:2.72\n\n### Exlplanation: To find the average of the pizza's sold, you have to take half of the 50. 25 is half the number of pizza's, and 50 is the total amount of pizza'a, so you can't have less for half because that means it would be a negative value.

This is a really tedious case. This case has 9 numbers from index 0 till 8.

We have 9 indexes available. Hence, we need to check if index [1] is smaller than or equal to which ever index is greater than 9. We use mod 9 in our check.\n\n### If we have 9 + 1 = 10 cases, [1] is divisible by 9 which is not a prime number. Hence, index 10 satisfies the requirement in our problem.

{"text": "The company needs to plant 800 more trees.\n\n### Why this works:\nThe number of trees we want to plant are the same as the number of trees we cut down. Then we subtract the number of trees we chopped down in the first half of last year, which leaves us with the number of trees for which we still need to plant seeds for those in the second half of last year. The number of total trees cut down is equal to the number of trees planted. Then we add the number of trees plants last year, to the total number of trees chopped down.\n\n\n### Input\nThe company wanted trees in the first half.\nThe company wanted 3 trees for each tree they cut down in the second half.\nSo in the first half, the company cut down 200 times 3 or 600 trees.\nIn the second half they continued this by cutting down 300 more for a total of 900 trees.\nSo now we need to find how many trees we need to plant to even out the numbers.\nThe company chopped down 600 + 900 = 1500 trees in all.\nWe are trying to come up with 1500 divided into 600 (the 200 chopped down in first half).\nThe total number of trees is 200 + 1500 = 1700\nSo 200 divided by 1500 equals.12 tree each. So the company needs to plant 12 more trees for each cut down tree in the first half...which brings us to 15 or 1600 trees chopped and 13 in last half or 1733.

He decided to have the car inspected before buying it.  A week later, the mechanic called to inform our hero that he had found a bad transmission leak in the car.  The mechanic made it clear that he couldn't guarantee the quality of the repair done by the private seller,  since they don't work with transmissions.  So, the man decided not to drive the car.  He didn't want to risk taking it out on the highway in a bad transmission.

{"text": "**A. 107.2 feet**\n\nThe problem is this: you have a rectangular plot of private land fenced in by a certain type of fence. The plot is two times as long as it is wide. A side of the plot is faded or damaged and needs replacement. To replace the entire fence, you need to count the lengths of all the sides. The sum of the length of every side of the fence equals 640.\n\nTherefore, you can divide 640 by 2. So, each side is 320 feet.\n\nThe width is three times as long as the length, which, in this case is 100 feet.\n\nSince your width is 100, and you're three times of that, your width is 300.\n\nThere is more length of the fence than width of the fence, two to one. There are twice as many feet of length, 640 feet for the entire fence, as there is width, 320 feet for the entire width. So, if the length and width of the fence are equal to 640 feet and 320 feet respectively, as described above, then you simply multiply the two. 640 x 100 = 64000, which is evenly divided by 320.\n\nOne half of 64,000 feet is 32,000, and we have to give an integer, so we have to divide by 64001.\n\nWe divide by 32001. We get 107.\n\nIf you got 208 and 210, your answer would not be the right answer.\n\n### Validation:\n\n\n### Instructor Note: \n\nIn a previous version, this was answered as 110.45 feet.\n\nHowever, that is incorrect.", "answer": " 80"}

{"text": "The answer for this would be 447. The full decks contain 52 cards. The half decks contain 26 cards. Each deck of cards is 52+26 =78. John threw the remaining 34 cards in the trash, which makes the question 78-34 = 44 cards. Now, he has 3 full decks and 4 half decks. Each half deck contains 26 cards. Half of the 26 cards are bad. So, John has 23 cards (26/2 = 13 bad = 11 and change) in each half deck. When you multiply 4 x 23, you get 82. When you subtract that from the 78, you get 6.

{"text": "The cheetah needs to accelerate at such a high speed and then maintain that speed that the math really breaks down. This isn't a typical classroom problem and there isn't much more data to work with because we don't know if the cheetah starts off at rest or at high speed and we don't know how long it took to start running at such a high speed in the first place. My best guess is the gazelle will likely pull away from the cheetah or the cheetah decelerate back below 60 mph which is enough for the gazelle to get away.\n\n### InputThe math book says \"An electric heater has a coil with a resistance of 4.25 ohms. If an electric current of 12.0 amperes flows around this coil, what total heat dissipation will result?\"\n### Response: Heat dissipation or energy transfer depends on the flow of thermal energy which is what heat is. The answer to this question can't be given in one simple answer.\n\n### Additional Information:\nIn the below task, students have to answer questions that ask them to define an expression using language.\n\n### Task:\n* What is a complex?\n* What is a real?\n* What is zero?\n* Is 3 an exact answer?\n* Explain what an approximation means.\n* What is a rational number?\\\n\n### Response\nI think the answers to these questions should be provided in the same way they are for most math problems. If I was given the problem and was asked to explain the expressions then I would start with definitions as to what the expressions actually are. For example, a complex is a number with real and imaginary parts. I would explain that real numbers are numbers that don't have an imaginary part. I would explain that a zero is a number that is equal to nothing and that 0 isn't an exact answer because 0 is the only number in math that is equal to 0. I would also explain that approximation is close enough for a problem that doesn't call for exact answers. In the example if the number was not very close to the real number and 6 was the number I needed, then one answer would be 6 rounded to the nearest tenths place which would be 6.0 or 6.625.

{"text": "There were 189kg of potatoes sold for the whole day. (29\\*7 + 17\\*7 = 189)\n\n### Solution\nThis is a sample question in the Algebra I test. A shop sold some bags of potatoes that weigh 7kg each.\nThe total amount of potatoes the shop needs to sell for the whole day is 29 + 17 = 46 bags.\nThus, the total weight of potatoes for the whole day is\n\n46\\*7 kg = 312 kg\n\nThe amount of potatoes sold in the morning and the afternoon is\n\n7\\*29 + 0 or 7\\*17 + 7\\*1 = 7\\*29 kg\n\n7\\*17 kg\n\nHence, the shop sold 46 kg of potatoes for the entire day.\n\n#### Source:\nhttps://www.albertsonsavings.com/\n\n1.

The steps are 5 feet long each, so the answer is 4( 10feet), which equals 40. So if John took 6 staircases, the answer would be 180 feet. In the real world, the person climbing steps cannot count as fast as you are counting in class.\n### Example: Let take the question: How long would 2 days be if 20years was 63years, 4months, 2weeks, and 9 days?\n\nTo solve this example, first find the amount of days that 20 years were divided by 360 days a year. 20years divided by 365days was 0.55565656, rounded up that equaled 0.6\nThen, take 0.6 and multiply it by 2 to make it 1.2\nTo find the amount of weeks that 1.2years were divided by 52weeks was.02386555 rounded up to.03\nThen find the amount of days when 0.03 divided by 366days was.00830555 rounded up was.1\nAnd finally, in the real world, you don't go by the number of weeks that it takes to count days.

First you find the amount of weeks it takes to add up to a total of 119 days with the equation.023*1.21*0.03*0.1*5^9*577)\n\nThe reason why the answer is not 120 was because this was a simulation math problem,", "answer": " 45"}

{"text": "The grill burned 3bags of coals, each bag containing 60 coals, for 20 minutes. If we assume that the grill ran for that amount of time, then we could 6 bags of coals in 20 minutes, or 30 coals in 2 minutes (because each bag contains 60 cools, and each bag is burned in 2 minutes), then when combined, the 6 bags would represent 180 coals. This would burn 180 coats in 10 minutes (the time the grill runs for), which implies that the grill is only using 18 coals in each minute of burning. So, we could then determine that the grill was burning 6 bags of coal for 20 minutes of burn time, allowing us to divide 6 bags (each containing 60 coats) by 20 minutes.\n\nIf we want 6 bags of 60 coats each to be burned in 20 minutes of grilling, then we could say that there are 100 minutes (the inverse of 20) when in 2 minutes that 1 bag of coats would burn through 50.\n\nWe could then take this and say that when the grill started to consume 50 coats in 2 minutes, it was only 50% capacity or full capacity. This implies that 50% of capacity indicates full capacity, which is 100 coats or one bag.\n\nAnd if we add 60 coats to 100, that is 160 coats, and this implies that there are 2 bags. If there are two bags of 6 coats, then there are 12 coats in each bag. To find the number of seconds in 12 cords, we could say that there must be 2 minutes in each second the grill burns.

We know that from this we must subtract the number of trips that Caleb puts in.\n\nNow for Caleb he put in 7 buckets with 7 gallons in each bucket so:\n(100-(11))/7\nThis is how many trips Caleb will make. \nNow 105-Cynth + Cynth is equal to 7+2 = 9 and in total that is equal to:\n\n```\n105/(7-9/2)\n```\n\n\n**Note:**\n\nThe way this is solved is to first of all calculate the numbers that are necessary to find out as well as the number of times each bucket has to be filled into the pool in order to fill. Then we substitute the numbers as well as the operation that are necessary to the equation,", "answer": " 7"}

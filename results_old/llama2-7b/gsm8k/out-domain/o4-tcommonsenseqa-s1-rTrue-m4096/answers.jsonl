{"text": "$12.00\n\n### Instructor:Betty, Weng does not work more than 50 minutes. So, she makes exactly $12.0\n\n### Response Rationales\n\n1. Betty is answering the question as follows: Weng's rate for babysitting is $12 an hour. If she works more than one hour, she makes more than $12; if she works less, she makes less than $12.\n2. The premise of the question is that Weng worked less than one hour, so Betty is saying that Weng would not expect to make more than $12. This explanation is incorrect.\n3. The explanation does not match up to the question. The question clearly states that Weng did less than an hour of babysitting, not that she worked more than one hour.\n4. In the context of the question and the numbers involved, Weng earned exactly $12. She either spent over 50 minutes or under 50 minutes babysitting. If she babysat for over 50 minutes, she would have earned more than $12 and if she babysat under 50 minutes, Weng would have earned under $12.\n5.

{"text": "$45\n\n### Explanation:\n1. We need to break each ingredient as follows:\n\n- 2 pounds of chdder cheese: 2 pounds of chdar cheese = $10\n\n- a pound of creme cheese: a pound of cremes cheese = $5\n\n- a pack of cold cutss: a pack of cold cutess = $10\n2. So, the total for cheese would be: $20\n3. Now, the total cost for \"cold cuts\" which is the only option that exceeds the cheddar chee ce cost, would be $20\n4. Thus, the total cost would be: $40\n5. Then, since the creme cheese cost is half the price of the cheese, the cost of creme cheese would be $10.\n6. Then, the total cost would include: $40 for cold cuts, $10 for creme cheese and $20 for the cheddar chees, leaving $10 for misc costs\n7. Thus the total cost would be $40 + 10 = $50.\n8. Finally, since the chdder chee ce cost was $10 and the creme chee ce cost was half, the total cost for cheese = 20 + 10 which is $30\n9. Then, using the \"twice the price of the chdder cheee ce cost\", we can eliminate $40 because the cold cuts are $10 and not $20 and the cheddar cheee ce is $10 and not equal to the $20 cost of the cold cuts.\n10. Therefore, the cost of all the cheeses combined is $30.\n11. Thus, $30 + $10 + $20 = $40 + $10 = $55\n\n### Input 3: Billy called out to Mary.

{"text": "There are 16 (1/2) cups of water plus the number of cups (n) of the flour, total 16 + n. Then, n must be divided by 2 times as many teaspons as is equal to the cups of flour and the teaspons' total is equal to half of 2(n) plus the cups as 16 divided by 2 = 8 times as many teaspomns as the cups. Therefore, the total cups as the salt plus 10 cups as water plus the 16 cups as the flour is equal to 34 times as many, and teaspoon, as the cups of as the flour.\n\n### Explained: \n1. The question is the same as what I mentioned in the first lesson - \"Kimber needs to make the water, flour, salt, altogether. The quantity of water is (10 + n), the flour as 16 and salt as 1/2 times of n.\"\n2. First, we calculate the water. In the first place, we have 10 + n cups of water as we know at the least 6 cups of water are needed. (10+6 = 16). \n3. After we have calculated the water, we have to divide n by 2 times as much as the cups of the flour, which is 16. Then, let's divide 8 into 6, 6 goes into 8, so we get 8/6, which means 8/6. \n4. 8/6 plus 16 equals 34 times as the cups of 16. Now, we can calculate the total cups of flour into cups of salt. 34(16) equals 564 cups, let's divide it 16 cups = 34 times.

Option C - 1790, however, could be a potential match if George's mother was born later than 1732 and died later than1790. \n4.

{"text": "Option 2, Peter Parker is 20 years old. \n\n**Tell me about it**: In this problem, all ages are listed as years. Therefore, multiplying any of the age numbers by 13 gives us the result of the sum of the original age number with 9. To get the original age, you must multiply the sum of 9 with the age number. \n\n**Explain what you know**: To begin, you must multiply each of the respective age numbers individually. This gives you Thor's age as 1456, Cap's age as 572, and Pete's age as 20. Then, you must multiply these age numbers, individually, by 9. This gives you 12, 47, and 18. Then, add all the numbers together. 947 gives you 1417. Add the original value to this number, which gives you 437. Now, use this number and the original Thor's age. Adding 1456 to this gives 1913. Now, multiply the age you found by 13. Doing so should give you your original starting age.

{"text": "10\n\n### Response Rationale: (First, we can eliminate a couple of choices because the number of people is greater than the number of rolls. Thus, we can eliminate choices C and E.) \nA) 0 (Since 16/40 - 0, and 16/4 - 0, we can say that there are left over 0. Since 40 - 0 = 40, the total number of people are 40, the same as the total amount of rolls. That would be 8 for the first half. 4 for the second half, 4x8=32 people are accounted for. (Total: 40) Thus if the total is 40, there are 0 left over, since there are 40.)\nB) 1 (Well, we know that the second half are eating exactly half a roll each. So, 0.5x16=8 people will eat 0.5 of a roll, and 8x0.5=4.00000..., but that is not an integer. Thus, 8 are in the first half, and 4x0.5=2. So 6 is leftover.)\nC) 5 (We know that there are 16 leftover. The first half are eating exactly 1.5 and the second half are eatting exactly 0.5. 1.5x16==8, but that doesnt look like an integer. Thus, the first half are eating 0.125 each. 16,0.125 is 1.875 so they ate 1.87. The second half are 0.5 each and 40 is divided by 0.5, the integer is 80. But 80!=5. 5 leftover.) \nD) 1 (2 is the total. Since half of the people are eating 1.5, there are 16 of those. 1 is half of that and its not an integer.)\nE) 2 (Since there are 40 people, if they eat an integer, there are 40 left over.

{"text": "Larry and Barry will be able to reach apples that are a total of 8 feet high.\n\n### Rationales: \n1.  If Barry stands ON Larry's shoulders, Larry will be 5 feet higher than normal meaning that Larry would be 25 feet tall. \n2.  We know that Larry is 75% of what? His full height. However, since we are not told what Larry is 75 percent of, we can't be 100% sure of who is 75% tall. Nevertheless, according to the problem statement, Larry's shoulder height is \"20% less\" than his full height. From context, it is most likely that his full height is the 5 feet that he is 5 feet tall plus the 12 inches he is missing (since 75% leaves 25%). This totals 6'5\" - 12 = 5'11\". \n3.  According to the problem statement, if they stand on top of each other, they can reach apples that total to \"5 feet high\". \n4.  It will take 2 different people to reach 6 feet.

For people to be considered part of a collection, they must all be able to add to the subject of the collection with the pieces they possess.  When items are gathered they become a group. A group is an example where collectors focus on organization of their pieces in a manner that helps them understand the collection and its values.\n\nWhen thinking about this answer, it is important to remember when collectors look to organize their collections.

The room is square and has the shape of a cube. In how many ways can the four apples and nine oranges be distributed among the group?\n\n### Reponse: ANSWER 16\n\n### Reaso:\n\n### To find the answer you should first think how many different ways are there to give all the apples to two people holding apples. There are only 1 way since every combination of person can have only one apple given to them.\n\nNext we consider the oranges. What are the odds one of them to get them all?\n\n\nThere is only 1 way to place the 10 oranges among 10 people. Now we add the two things together so as not to repeat. There were four apples given to each two, so there are actually 3 ways to put apples among all the people. However, we already covered this, so we do not count them twice. Now there are five oranges and 8 people, so there are 1 way to put them down (for a total of 3,16,1)\n\n### Question: Why should you not place an apple in the middle of the group since there are four apples? Think this through because this way of distributing them in a more complicated pattern.\n\n### Question answer:\nYou can not do so because you have to account for two pairs with two people holding apples and you did not think about this scenario.\n\n### Problem:You are placing the nine oranges in a row, how many different ways are you able to place them down?\n\n### Solution:\nSince 9 goes into two (the amount of people holding apples) nine times without a remainder, it may be arranged in", "answer": " 1728"}

Next, you explain the fact with the necessary details**\n\nAlison purchased 3 large tubs and 6 small tubs. Her total price to buy the tubs adds up to $48. Given that, we can say the following, \"If the large tubs cost 6 dollars, how much do the smaller ones cost?\"\n\n##### Deductive Conclusion:\n**Deductive conclusions start with a logical conclusion and use reasoning to arrive at a deductive conclusion. You can present this in either prose or in the form of a proof**\n\nThe deductive conclusion for our given input/example is, \"Alison's large tubs cost $0.718 per item.\" Because the cost of the three large storage tubs is equal to $19.35, and the total cost of buying the three large tubs and the six small tubs from the example is $48, we should subtract $19.34 from $48 which shows that Alison's small tub price is $28.66.\n\n##### Deduction in Prose:\nHere's a simple example using deductive math:\n`Alison's large storage tubs cost 0.718 dollars each.\nTotal price is $19.32.\n0.718 - 19.32 = $28.97.`\n\n#### Inductive Conclusion: \n\nInductive conclusions are the opposite of a deductive conclusion because they start with the conclusion and use logical reasoning rather than math to build the conclusion. There are some different ways to present this type of result in either formal or more casual writing:\n\nIf $6 is the price of one large storage tub, then we can say that $0.711  is the price of the small storage tub.\n\nAlison bought a total of seven storage tubs.

As indicated in Choose the Best Response, a response to a question of this nature should be completed by taking everything that is given, and everything that was not given, to form an appropriate answer. With this question, we would take the first part, where it states the three persons, and their total load, and create new questions that allow us to determine the answer. The first one is, if all these things are true, and the other two people got a total of 37, was not Ela\u2019s load 4? Because it is implied they all got the same amount of wood. This leaves the choice of 13, 17 or 25 which is incorrect in one way, shape or form. To find out the answer, you would also have to consider how much Ela had.

{"text": "First, let's calculate how many chickens you can sell with a 65 dollar profit.\nFirst, calculate the feed you need. 65/15=4.333333 chickens. This is then multiplied by 2 pounds needed per chicken (since a bag weighs 22 pounds which leaves 3.3333 pounds per chicken). The result is 11.3333 chicken required to make 65 dollars, rounding to a perfect number of 12.\nThen, consider that each chicken weighs 2 pounds. Therefore the weight of one chicken is 2 pounds. That means each bag weights 110 pounds, which when dividing by 20 comes out to exactly 5.5 bags, or 4.3 chickens per bag. The total amount is 12.5 chickens per bag and 5.5 baggies. Thus, Lao would be able to sell 65/12.5 =5 chickens.\n\n### Additional Question(10-22)\n### Output:\n\n### Input 10-Demonstration 3\n\nInput : We need to help Kyle get home before dark.

He would be there for about a year or so and leave about $5,000 for my grandmother, who would have to make about $1,000  a month.  I saw this iconic structure called the the Space Needle.  We knew it by name because my mother kept telling me about the structure as I grew up.  She knew I would love it when I saw it. The first time I saw it is was not clear to me what I would do, but I had a camera and my grandmother gave me $500, which I spent for a camera and film.

{"text": "The first route has 3 stoplights and that will take 10 minutes. If all 3 stoplight are red the time it will take will increase 3 minutes each. So the new time will be 14 minutes.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n#### Initiatives and Tasks\n\nThe task of this question is \"How much longer will his trip will be if all 3 signs are red?\"\nWe are given information about the following:\n1. The first route has 3 signs\n2. If all 3 signs are green the time will be 10 minutes\n3. If the the 3 signs are red the time it take will increase by 3 minutes each\n\nWe have our goal (\"the time it will take will be 14 min\") therefore we can determine the best way to solve this problem by finding the most efficient possible way to find the 14 min time. So we want to 1) eliminate all the information we know doesn't help us 2) make sure we have as correct data as possible. In this case we have all the data we need to arrive at the final answer after we follow the steps above.\n1. Eliminate unnecessary\nWe're provided information that all three signs are green. We're trying to find the time if the signs are red. That information is unnecessary and unnecessary information will make the problem harder and takes away from our end goal.\n2. Include all information provided\nInformation about the route taking ten minutes is unnecessary because that is not our goal. We are trying to find the time when the signs are red and that information will lead away from the problem and make it a more difficult problem.\n3. Determine the \"if-then\" relationships\n10 minutes means that all three signs are red. The if-then relationships are, \"if a sign is red it takes 3 minutes to pass\" and the second \"this 3 min has to happen at least 3 times to take a total of 10 minutes\"\n4. Reason backwards - We are trying to determine if all 3 signs need to be red to take 10 min.\n\nSo if we use \"if-then\" rule 1 we get that if 1 sign is red then that takes 3 min, If there are 3 signs that is the equivalent of 3 x 3 min = 9 min.

{"text": "$250 + $0 + $40 = $290 \n\n### Explanation:\nThe amount of the whole is $250, James owns $4 less than the whole, and James owns $4 more than Ali. Therefore, if you know that James own $40 more than all together: $250 + $40 + $0 = $350 and then you can subtract from $350 to be sure that you have not exceeded the $250: $350 - $250 = $100. Then, James owns $100 ($100/0.40) of the total. Then take James' own and add your whole and that's it. \n\n### Input and response:\n\n### Input\nTony got up at 5:52 p.m. If you know he got up at 5 minutes past an hour, how many hours is that? Choices: \n\n### Response\n2\n\n### Rational(es)\nThe answer is 2 because an hour in minutes are 60. So, he got up at 6:52 PM and that would be two after he gets up at the time. The question states he woke up at 5:00 p.m. and if you know that he woke up at one hour after getting up at 5: p.m., you should add 12 and 12 to make it an even number of hours.

A: 50 year is incorrect because Betty was X percent older than John at age 2X and Betty is 60 years older than John, so Betty is two-fifth than John's age. John will be two years older.\n2. B: 50 years is correctly because Betty's age is twice than her daughter's age. And her daughter's will be half of John's. As Betty is 4 times older than her daughter.

{"text": "40\n\nIn this kind of question, the best thing to do is to keep the number of the members and roller skates straight in your mind. To find the number of sets of laces given out, we just need to find the number of pairs by multiplying the number of members and roller skate each member get. Then we divide that by the number of roller skate and laces member get by the pairs.\n\nSo the working is like this:  \nMembers are 10 times 2(roller skates are given to each team members) equals to 20 pairs. The total number of roller skates that members have is the product of 10 times 3 (3 sets of laces are given by each pair of roller skate). This is 30. So the number of sets of the laces that members have is (20/30) equals to 2/3.

{"text": "A: 20\n\n### Rationale: 1. This task requires a bit of thinking, but it is fairly easy to comprehend.\n2. Let's start by using the values 10,15,19,20,25. \n3. The easiest assumption is to write those values in a line (10-15-19-20-25) and simply replace each value with their correct positions (10,15....,25) in the sum of 45.\n4. We can simplify by multiplying each number times 1.5 on one side to get 15, 22.5,30,37.5,45.\n5. Since Billy's age is doubled every 10 years, we can use the logic that Billy will be 23.3 years in 2025, 25.6 in 2035, 27.9 in 2045, and 30.2 in 2055.\n6. We subtract 30.2 from Billy's age, then 45-20=25, 20+25=45.\n7. This means that Billy will be 45 years in 2030. Since Billy is aged 20 in the question, his brother is aged 25 in 2038, because they are each other's ages at the same time. \n8. You can try it in the calculator, simply subtract 2030 from 2038 and this gives you 2028.\n9. Billy is 2 years older than his brother, and therefore 25 years younger than Billy.\n10. Therefore, the answer to the question of how old Billy is now is 19 years. \n11. If there's any doubt, you can put the 15,19 and 20 on the calculator and do a few simple operations to verify that the answer is 19. \n12.

{"text": "The correct answer is 36. The first thing I do is to look at the options to decide what would make sense. If two floors have 6, two floors must have 5. That gives me a total of 39. At most, each apartment can have 4 residents which only gives us a total of 16. That means 16 plus 23 equals 39. This means one apartment can\u2019t live in two floors. But since two floors have 5, it must be that 3 of the 12 floors (2.5x 5) have 5 floors, and the rest have 6. This means one avenue we can take is to go 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0.

{"text": "He should leave at 0710 hours (7:10). He needs to allow himself 30 minutes to reach the station, then another 1-1/2 hours for the train to reach Los Angeles.\n\n### Correctness:\nIsolate this task to its essential elements. First, we are asked for a time at which a person can leave such that they still have a 9:00 am deadline, but they must arrive at LA by then.\nNext, we can determine our constraints by writing these variables:\nTime to leave train station, `t_train_station`\nTime to arrive at home, `t_home`\nTotal time spent traveling, `t_total`\nStart time, `t_1`\nEnd time, `t_2`\n\nUsing these variables, let `total_diff` = `t_2 - t_1` and `train_diff` = `train_station - t_1`.\nNext, we must determine a value for `t_1`. If we're given a time between 0900 and 0900, then the only way for this to be possible is for `t_total` to be greater than 1020 minutes.\nUsing `total_diff`, if we are to start at 07:00, we are then constrained to `t_2 > 120` because the amount of `t_1` that is left allows us to reach the train station at 07:30 and take a 30 minute train ride to reach LA at 08:00.\n\nTherefore, there is little more we must do than to solve for `t_1` where `t_total > 1020`, `train_station > 07:36:00`, and `t_2 < 08:04`.\nThe solution is for `t_1 = 07:11:39`. \n\n# Additional Examples\n### [Example 1](http://goo.gl/z6rWU4)\nGiven the data below, what would the output be if I used this data frame, 'c1_temp', as data for a linear regression model?\n\n|Variable|Dependent Variable|\n:------:| ----", "answer": " 730"}

If 40% of students will participate in any way in the fundraiser, what percent will donate money to the cause? Choices: 1. A: 18%, B: 10%, C: 20%, D: 45%\nRationales: **The solution to this question requires some advanced mathematical logic to perform the calculations.**\n\n1. First, we recognize the question as simply a rate or multiplication problem. This leaves us with the option to solve the problem using either the percent sign (inverse of a decimal fraction), or division by 100. The question doesn't mention the percent or percentage that the students in the class will be participating in the fundraiser. Therefore, it is most logical to consider this a division problem using the percent symbol because it allows us to determine the percent of students that will participate in any form.\n2. We should use the correct division format for this to ensure accurate results. The correct way to calculate the rate using the word or phrase \"percent of\", as in \"the percent of people who will donate money\", is to use the format per hundred, which is simply %. \n3. To find the percentage who will donate money, we will need to use the division format and multiply the percentage of students who are donating by 100, which will give us the \"percent of students who will donate money\".

Mara rode the Ferris wheel once. since she already spent $4 earlier, she didn't spent any money on this third ride of the Ferris wheel.\n\n7. Therefore, Riley spent $16 and Mara spent $5, totaling $21. We know that the total amount of money spent by both Riley and Mara is a multiple of 23. We can now find the remainder of the division.\n\n8. Divide $21 by 23 and the remainder is 3. This means that the total amount of tickets bought by both Riley and Riley was a multiple of 7.\n\n9. Add up the number of times each person rode each type of ride. Riley rode the bumper cars two times, therefore $7 is equal to 2 times $3. Mara rode the space shuttles four times, therefore $ 8 is equal to 4 times $ 2. Riley rode the carousel three times, therefore $ 9 is equal to three times $ 3.\n\n10. As a result, the total number of tickets Mara and Riley bought is a multiple of 82.\n\n11. Since $ 23 is a multiple of 7, $(23*8) $= 183 $. Now, there are only 82 tickets on the board which is less than $ 183 $. We must also deduct $ 16 for Mara's tick", "answer": " 50"}

{"text": "The area of the rectangle is 120/9 square inches.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question specifies that the rectangle is '4 inches wide.\n2. The question further specifies the perimeter of the rectangle is 30 inches.\n3. The formula to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle A = 2*L+2*, where A is area and L is length. Substituting L with 4 yields the perimeter of this rectangle is (2*4) + 2 = (8 inches) + 2 inches = 10 inches.\n4. Let's rewrite this as: A = A*\u03c0 where \u03c0 = 3.14159\u2026 (Applying the formula A)\n5. Now we can solve for A: A = \u03a0*L*L or A = (3.1416) * (4*4) or A = 98.5 square inches\n6.

{"text": "4.5 cups\n\n### Rationale:Let's look at the food that each dog eats. First, option A, is a 1.5 cupper. From the question, we know that this is the amount of food that the first dog eats.\n\nNext, let's look at option B, which is double the amount of the first choice. From the question, option B is twice as much as the 1.5 cuper. Since we know that there are three dogs, multiply this 1.5 cupers per day by two.\nIn order to account for the third dog, we have to look at option C. We can use this option to tell us how much extra food we need to account for the third animal, compared to the first two. By knowing that the third one eats 2.25 more than option B, we can calculate how much food B is to start with. Since we know that we use B times the multiplier, multiply, and the remainder will get us to the final amount.\n\nFrom this logic, the total amount of food that the three pets would require in one day is 4.5 cuppers.", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "Input: What is the height of the computer screen if the side of a square piece of paper is 40 cm? If so, what is the side of the square piece of paper? \nChoices: a) 40 cm b) 20 cm c) 22.5 cm d) 37.5 cm e) 25 cm\nRationales:\n1. The height of a computer screen cannot be computed by the formula if the side of the piece of paper is not known. So we need to determine the value of n in the formula first, which is related to the side of the piece paper.\n2. Choice c cannot be the real response, since since the perimeter of a square paper is 210 cm which is 20 cm longer than the height of the computer monitor. For the piece paper to have a perimeter of 210 cm, its side must be 20 cm longer or equal to 225 cm. We can check that 20 cm < 22.5cm.\n3. Choice d is definitely unacceptable since the height of the screen, 52.5 cm cannot be the side of a square paper since it is half of the perimeter.\n4. Choices A and B are not sufficient, since they do not consider the height of the computer screens which is part of the answer.\n5. Finally, the only logical answer that includes the height of the computer and that does not discount the height of the computer, and is not contradictory to the rest of the question is choice e 25 cm\n6.

{"text": "First we should break down this question and see what parts are relevant.  We are given enough information that this question is purely mathematical, and we don\u2019t need any additional background or assumptions to make a conclusion.\n\n### The problem\n\nWhat we are being asked to calculate is \u201c38 \u2013 1\u201d. Essentially, we are to count all the chickens Wendi has, subtract 1 (since the dog is confirmed to have eaten 1), and then add 7, since there are 7 chickens to start with, plus the additional chickens she has purchased over the past few days.  However, she also has 2 less since she is missing one chicken.\n\nSo, we have:\n38 \u2013 1 = 37.  Therefore, the final number of chickens Wendi owns is 37.\n\n### Conclusion: The correct answer to the problem is \u201c37\u201d.\n\n### Feedback:\n\nWe could also have come up with the final number by subtracting one from the 38 she originally started with (\u201c38 - 1 = 36\u201d) and then adding 1, since she purchased 4 chickens over the course of 2 days.  The problem does not specify how many days between the original amount and the addition of the further purchased chickens.\n\n### Rationales:\n\nThe only other answer that can\u2019t be eliminated is \u201c41\u201d because it is the next number after 39, the last number that was given in the problem.  However, it is easy to eliminate this option by realizing that she only brought home 4 chicken, so she could not have brought home any number of chickens \u201cless than or equal to ten\u201d, given that she owned, \u201c\u2026and brought them home too\u201d.\n\n### Assessment:\n\nThis response is logical and has a reasonable explanation for how the response is arrived at.\nIt is somewhat verbose, but it clearly explains how to arrive at the final answer.\n\nThis question is more than just answering the questions given.

{"text": "### Rationales:\nInput: Bella bought 6 truck stamps and 6 rose stamps, giving her a total of 22 truck stamps.\n\n### In general, the first rule of counting stamps is to start with the least amount of stamps. Because there were more truck stamps, they have to take precedence over rose stamps.\nInput: For 6 rose stamps to equal 22 trucks stamps, there had to be 6 less rose stamps than there were truck stamps. Since Bella had 5 fewer rose stamps than she did truck stamps, it is logical to say that there were 13 truck stamps. In other words, 13 x 22 = 266, and therefore 5 x 266 = 133, which makes the total stamps bought 133 + 6 = 139.\nInput: We can count 12 in different combinations of six and six until we figure out all 12.

The boat can take 42 people altogether. \nWhen there are 2 trips (12h of the day) and 42 people, we get 11 people in each boat.\n\n### Rationale: We can see that there are 12 trips, so if we take every boat twice in a day, we get 24 trips. When we have 24 trips, there's 24*42 people, total, and 24*4=12 trips:\n\n24*12 = 288\nThus, 288 people can fit in that amount of time. So if we take 12h, we get 12 trips. 24 divided by 12 = 2.\nThat means we have 2 trips for each 12h so when there are 2 day rides, there are 24 trips; when there are 2 tripping (12h) we get:\n24 trips, each trip - 11 people total, we get 50 people for one day:\n42*11 = 472\n472 divided by 24 gives us 19 which is the last digit before repeating the same number i.e. 24.\n\n### Answer:\n24 tripping (12 hour trips) with 42 people on average (4 people on each boat in 2 trips.

Inner height of smaller cup = 4 (small cup's radius is 2 so smaller cup's height is 4)\n2. Inner height of larger cup = 4 (larger cup's radius is the same so larger cup's height is the same)\n\nTherefore, radius of smaller cup = 2/14\n\nRadius of larger cup = 14/13 (inner height of larger cup = height of smaller cup multiplied by larger radius. So, you can get larger radius by solving for radius which results in radius of larger cup = 2/3. The 2/3 just came about because of the 4 heights which resulted to a 4.

{"text": "Kyle must make 26 origami stars to fill his glass bottles.\n\n### Explanation:\nWe should start to think about how many origami stars Kyle made for each glass bottle. We start with first 2 bottles, since he bought 2 identical glass bottles, he must have created 15 stars. To find the number of stars for the rest 3 other glass bottles, we should subtract for how much stars we used per each bottle. \n```\n- Kyle bought 2 identical glasses\n- It is the 5th batch in the bottle\n- Therefore, there are 4 batches in each of both, the 1st glass and the 2nd.\n- To fill both bottles, Kyle makes 3x batches of origami stars.\n```\nIn total, so far, he has 3 batches of origami star (15 origami stars + 3 batches of stars). Now, let's find how many stars Kyle makes in the 3rd glass bottle:\n```\n- For the 3rd glass, there are 6 more stars than there are for the 2nd glass\n```\nWe have 4 batches of stars - 3 batches for the first 2 glass bottles and one batch for the 3rd glass. We must remember this formula.\n```\n- (number of stars for the first 2 batches x batches in the first 2 batch) + (number of stars for only one glass)\n```\nNow we must fill all the stars for the 2nd and finally the 3rd bottle. It will give us:\n```\n3x15 + 4x15 + 3x15 + (4 - 1) x 15 = 120\n```\nIn total:\n```\n4x15 + (1 + 1 + 1) x 3 = 34 + 3 + 3 = 69\n```\n\n### Exercise I - Complete the chart with the following information below.

{"text": "A: 6 B: 600\n\n### Demystification:\n\nThere are two approaches to solve this problem. The first is to note that if every book is one inch thick and that 12 inch is how high the stack is, each book must be 1 inch deep. The second is to divide the total number of pages through the number of books to come up with a value for each book.\n\n### Rationales:\n\nSince books are the size of the one inch thick, there must be (12)/(1)=12 inches in the stack. Jack knows for himself there are 80 pages in every inch. There must be 80 pages in the stack. We could either say that there are 12 pages per book, or we could say the stack is 12 books high. Assuming the stack has 12 books, the next number of pages in the stack is 160, because 160+80=240, which is the number of times the number of pages is 80 in total stack. We could also say there is 12 pages per books in the stack, because if the stack is 10 books high, the next layer contains 80 pages since there were 80 in the total stack, and in the next book, there must be 80+16=96, 96 is the same as 80+12 since every book contains 12 pages.

We know that each bucket is twice as expensive as the last since the more you buy the cheaper it eventually gets. One bucket is 2x1 so the second bucket has to be 2x2 so 4x3 cancels out and now it is 6x2. Every time you triple it it is also twice as expensive.

{"text": "John will have $100 left in his piggety bank.\n\n### Rationale:\nWe are solving this question using the method of substitution. We have the equation $25x + 2y + 400 = xy = 100$ in which we can substitute the known variable $x$ for $y$ so that we can solve both sides for $y$.\n### Note\nRemember to read all options carefully, this problem had a $y$ instead of a $x$, it can be very easy to overlook that.\n\n### Input\nJohn puts $10 in his piggybank every month for 1 year to save up for a trip.He has $500$ at the end of the year.\n\n### Response\nWe can put the values of $10$ and $500$ in the first part of the equations $b-c = 10$ and $b-d = 500$, that is, $b = 600$.\nUsing these values for $b$ we are able to solve for $c$ and $d$. We get $c = 10000 - 600 = 9400$.\n\n### Rationales:\nWe can find $c$ and $3-c$ so that $0(3 - c) = 500$ or $3 - c = 500/0$, so there is no $c$ for which we can solve for $3 - c$.\n\n### Input John put $ 100 $ a month on a piggy bank and earned 52% how much will the John get from saving money\n\n### Rationel\nWe use simple interest method to solve\n\nS= (P \u00d7 (RT))/(100(1+ R))\n\nS=0.100(0.052)*100/(1+ 0.052)\n\nS= $ 2.0625$\n\n### Input What is the range for the following set of numbers of animals?\nChoices:132, 121, 140 250, 178, 259\nAnswer: 250\n\n### Rant", "answer": " 200"}

{"text": "The weekend time period may result in a revenue of $1200; however, the restaurant owners should account for expenses or losses as well. Since the company does not explicitly reveal how much profit they earn over the month, we can infer that the losses are greater than the weekend gains. Thus, the restaurant only earned $480.\n\n### Rationales: To answer this question, we first have to understand the problem and its implications.\n\n1. The weekend earnings are twice the weekend earnings. This indicates that the company earns 2x during the weekend.\n2. The weekday earning of $400 may suggest an hourly profit between $10-$20 every weekday.\n3. The combination of the weekday profit and an increase of $400 weekend profit indicates that the company is likely earning $600 every month.\n4. To determine the company's actual total profits at a particular month, we have to account for expenses. This will be deducted from their profits and provide the company's net profit.\n5. The net profit will then indicate just how much extra money the company is making during weekends.\n\n### Note: The company's net profit would be $480 since their monthly expenses were 2x their weekend's increased revenue, netting the total revenue of $600; thus, the company actually earns $800; $480 in profits.", "answer": " 21600"}

It is asking what was the total cost, $ in dollars, of the 6 cards he bought.\n\n### Deduction:\n1. First, know if the answer is rational. This is $2.155, rounded up to $2.16.\n2. Second, eliminate the options. This can be eliminated by knowing if the answer is between 2.15 and 2.16. If the answer is between these numbers, the next method is to plug them in and see if the answer comes out. If the answer does not come out to between 2.10 and 2.15, the answer is not correct.\n3. Third, make the answer to the question. To make the answer, place the total cost in the formula. In this case, you are solving for the x. In the formula for making the answer, you have 6 cards for both boxes, and so you then multiply 6 by $1.25 for the first box, and multiply 6 by $ 1.75 for the second box. As the boys buy 6 cards from each of the boxes, they end up buying 12 cards total. This means the cost in dollars is of 12 cards, not just the cost to the first box.

First, we should see what units our answer options are supposed to be in.\n2. We realize that the options should be in Celiuss, because the first word, temperature and the third word,  thermograph,  are both in Celiuss.\n3. Therefore, our answer options should read as: 1.

{"text": "360\n\nInput: What number when multiplied by 1.6, gets you 34? Choices: A: 24 B: 29 C: 32 D: 36 E: 42\nRationales: This problem uses common division and multiplication processes. First we divide 42 by 1.6 to get a number that times 1.6 is equal to 34. 1.6 is an even number so division will have to be done with a remainder of 0. Now the rest of the problem is the inverse math problem. To find 24 using multiplication we just need to know we need to multiply 24 by 1.6 or 42. Then the remainder we know we need to get is the starting number. So the remainder comes back as 15. The original number is just the rest after it is divided so it is 3. Therefore the inverse problem can be solved for 24.\n\nAnswer: C: 32\n\n### Input:-198 multiplied by 2 is equivalent to the sum of 14 and -2.

The phrase \"Smoke, anyone\" seems to be talking about a host or hostess making a request for a couple of people in attendance to light a cigarette or cigar and then offering a compliment about their choice of habit by pointing out that anyone can do it. The hostess would ask the question \"Smoke, Anyone?\" in the context of offering to light up for anyone who could light a smoke and enjoy it. We do not read in the exclusion of offering to light up a cigarette/cigar by the hostess for one person.\n\n### Answer: D: use two hands because they would use them to light up the cigarette.\n\n### Choice A: A knife is not the tool you are looking for when you want to light up or smoke.\n\n### In Choice B: Cigarette in the question means the question would ask \"Smoke anyone?\" which indicates you have to use a cigarette, or if you use Cigars, it must me Cigars and not Knives.\n\n# Choice C: Two Cigarettes will make the task very tricky as they need to light up together, so answer choice D is a good choice.\n\n#\n\n### Input\"My dear, the sunlight is so beautiful this morning.

{"text": "In this question, we are looking at finding the original number of marbles that Archie started with. With this information, we can then find the answer to the question of how many marbles he has left.\n\nTo begin, let's start with our given information and translate it into a useful mathematical equation.\n\nThe equation that we will be working with is: \\(x=total\\left(1-60%\\right)\\) +50%, where \\(x\\) represents the original number of marbals. \nTo work through the equation and find the solution, we could plug in the numbers from our statement.\n\nOur given numbers are that \\(20\\) marbles are left and \\(60\\) marbles have been lost. This means that \\(20% + 60% = 80%, or 0.8 = 80%.\\)\nSo our given equation for calculation becomes: \\(x=total(1-0.8)\\) +50%. \n\nIn order to solve our equation, we need to break down our calculation of the original number of marble into two pieces that we will be working on separately. To begin, we can determine the total number of marbles Archie started with. Let's do this by adding up the original number of marballs that Archie started with and the number of marbles he initially lost since he will now be starting with \\(20\\)-60 = \\(40\\) marbles. \n\nThis number, \\((50+50)\\), becomes our second step in our equation. Using our equation: \\(x=total((1-0.8)+50```%)``. \n\nNow that we know the original number of marbelss, we can put the equation we set up earlier into context and solve the equation. \n\\(x=total(1-(0.8)+5)\\) +50%  \n\\(x=20-0.2```+5\\)`` = 19.82  \nNow that we know how many marbles Archie started, we can subtract those from the 20 marbles left in the street and find how many of Archie's marbles were lost in the sewer. To find this, we can simply subtract out 19.8 from 20, which makes the remaining number 0.2.", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "The question states that Brian doubled the amount of times he can hold his breath underwater last week, then this week, he doubled it again and the final week he increased it by 5.  Therefor, Brian can now hold his breath for roughly 16 seconds.  This is because last week, he could hold his breath for 20 seconds because he doubled it from 10.  The final week he could hold it for 25 seconds.  Then the week before, he doubled that number to 50 and thus he can hold his breath by roughly one and a half minutes.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe amount Brian can hold his breath for doubles every week, because that means the amount of time he holds his breath for doubles in one week, and the amount of time he held his breath for doubles every subsequent week.  Since the amount of time Brian holds his breath for also doubles every week, the amount of time Brian can hold his breath also doubles every week.  By the end of the third week, he will be halfway done and thus, 16 seconds would be the final time.  This is logical because after the first week, his breath holding time doubles to ten.  And we know his breath holding time will double again from there, so he starts with ten and it doubles every week, which then leaves his final time being around ninety seconds.\n\nHowever, let's just calculate his final time.  We have the amount of time he will hold his breath for starting the first week at ten seconds, doubling to twenty and then half of twenty, which is ten seconds, then we know that the third week we've found double digits to be half of what he held his breath for, so that number would be five seconds.  But if we subtract the half, we know we would be left with the full number he could hold his breath after, which is five seconds.  This would then be equal to a half of his current ability to hold his breath, which is twenty five seconds.  But the next week, the amount of seconds he can hold his breath would be twenty times two, or forty seconds.  Double that, which will lead us into one minute and one second.  So, since we add fifteen to the amount of time in the question, we know that Brian can hold his breath to one minute and five seconds.\n\nNow let's check to see if my math", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "Her aunt is 37 years old.\n### Rationale: \n1. This question asks us to find the age of a character's aunt, where the character is 3 years old.\n2. The following are some facts/premises that we know:\n    - The character is 3 years of age.\n    - In 5 years, the character will be one-third of her aunt's age.\n3. By substituting the values of our variables, let's determine the age of the character's aunt. \n    - The character's age: 3 years\n    - Character and aunt's relation: Aunt\n    - The character and aunt age relations: Character is one-third of Aunt's age\n    - Our goal: Find aunt age\n4. The question tells us the character is 3, which means the character is one-third their aunt's age as well, which is equal to the character's age in 5 years.\n5. Let's plug all the numbers into the formula using the values of the problem's characters. \n    - Character's age: 1/3(Aunt's age)\n    - Character' age in 5 years: 1/3 = 5\n6. To find aunt's age, we divide the character's age by 5 to determine her aunt's current age.\n    - 1/3(13) = 4 + 3 = 7\n    - The aunt's age is therefore 37 years old\n7. Therefore, the correct and logical answer is that the aunt is 3 years old, which means the aunt is 1/3(3) = 1 (3 years old) in 5 years.", "answer": " 19"}

The word \"Judges\" in this problem refers to a number quantity, since \"Judges\" is not the name of a unit.\n3. Next, 10% of Judges in Rhode Island are under 30, so we're looking for 40 * 10% of the age younger than 30, since Judges are under 60 by that age group to be eligible to be Judges.\n4. Therefore, 40 * 0.1 = 4 (10% of 40 = 4)\n5. The second part of the question asks for 60% of Judges that are 30-40, therefore we can look for 60% (40 + 10% of 30) = 21 (60% of 39 = 21 + 4)\n6. As can be seen, there is overlap in a group for 21 (the same number we looked for in the second part), which means 21 Judges in Rhode island are under 60. \n7. In the third part of this question, there's an interesting phrase \"the rest of the Judges\", which refers to the remaining Judges in Rhode Island, since there are more than 40 Judges. \n8. In a word, that phrase suggests that the Judges left need to be accounted for. \n9. Therefore, of the remaining Judges, 60 of them can be accounted for since 60% of 21 are 12, and 12 is closer to 5 than to 30. \n10. Therefore, we can infer that 6 out of the remaining 50 = 6 (60% of the remaining 5 = 3, 3 are closer to 5 than 30)\n11. There are 40 Judicial seats in Rhode Island.

How far did he drive a total?\nFirst we need to figure out the rate of the first half.\nIf James drove 30mph for 30 minutes, he drove x miles. 30mph=x miles/30 minutes. (The x is already in the equation) So we solve this for x. We do this by factorizing the 30. Simplify this by taking the bottom of the fraction to the bottom. When I did I got 15miles/minutes. So x=15 x 30. And now we can add 15x30. So he will drive 450 miles.\nSecond we figure out how much he drove in the second half of the day.\nIf he drove 450 miles and he drove twice as fast for twice the time, he will drive 800 miles.\n\n\nSo, 450 + 800=1250 miles of driving.\n\n\n\n### Input(Repeat): A. He drives 20mph for half an hour, and then twice the speed for twice the amount of time.\n\n### Response(Repeat):\nFirst, I am going to break it down to half an hour each. \n\nIn the left side I have 20mph. In the right side I have 2 of it. We can divide 20 by 2 to get 10. Each hour he will drive 10 miles.\nIn the left side, it says that for 1/2 an hour (30 mins) he will drive x miles. The left side should now be equal to the right side. We did that by dividing 20 by 5. So \n\nIf we can find x for right then we can plug it back in and solve for x in right\nso\nx=(10 )/ 30\nWe multiply both sides by 30.  (Both sides are equal) So x now is 10/30 and we can solve for x\nX=300/3. So X=100.  (It is also called that way since its all over the problem)\n\nIf we put 10", "answer": " 75"}
{"text": "6\n\nInput: What can you find inside a toothpaste tube? Choices: 1. A: floss B: rinse C: tooth powder D: shredder E: cleaning brush \nRationales: This is a tricky question that requires careful consideration. Here are some key points to help you identify the answer:\n\n* The question asks what is found inside a toothpaste 'tube'.\n* This wording suggests that toothpaste is a tube. This means that any items found in the toothpaste must also be found in a tube.\n* The question explicitly mentions toothpaste. Other items outside the tube, such as the container, the toothbrush handle, etc., cannot be considered answers to the question.\n* For these reasons, we can eliminate answers 1 and 2.\n* Answer 3 ('tooth powder') is incorrect because we know that tooth powder is not usually found within a toothpaste tune. As a result, 3 cannot be considered correct.\n* Answer 4 is also incorrect. While a brush is an essential accessory commonly found with toothpaste, it is not necessarily exclusive to toothpaste itself. Other things that might share the same design are hair brushes or even toothbrushes.\n* Therefore, the only answer that remains is E (cleaning brush).\nAnswer: E: cleaning brish.", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "$2150\n\n### Demostration:\n#### Rearrange to reduce\n1. The question states that James purchased three dirt bikes for one hundred and fifty dollars and four off-road vehicles for three hundred dollars.\n2. This tells us he paid three hundred and fifty dollars for the off-road vehicles.\n3. The question then tells us it costed James twenty-five dollars to register each of these, which means the cost to register all the vehicles was seventy-five dollars.\n4. Then we know that the dirt bikes costed seven hundred and fifty dollars and the off-road vehicles would cost one thousand and twenty-five dollars.\n5. So, the total amount James would pay is one thousand and twenty-eight dollars and seventy-five cents.\n6. So, the total cost was one thousand, two hundred and twenty-eight and seventy-five, or $1228.75.\n\n### Input:[x represents what x represents 128 x 75\n\n### Demosration:\n#### Break down the expression into smaller factors of x\nIn this expression, x does not represent a number.

{"text": "The centers combine to make profit of $750.00 per week.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. To solve this, it is necessary to take the total amount of packages processed by both centers and then subtract the original input of the second center to find the total profit of both centers.\n2. Gary manages two Amazon distribution center, the first being a package center that processes 100,000 packages per week. The second center processes three times as many packages. This would mean it processes 300,00 packages per week \n3. Therefore, the two distribution centers process a total of 400,008 (400k) packages per week.\n4. To find out how much this combined 400k packages per week would cost, simply multiply this figure by 5c (which is.05). This figure is $20,000 per week. \n5. The profit of each distribution center is simply the total profit divided by the number of packages processed. Using our input figures this would be\n$200,00 (100k + 300k)/400k, or.5c/$ (cents per package).\n6. This will give a combined profit of ($20,00 +.5*) = $21,000.", "answer": " 14000"}

First, we are given some knowledge that Roberto's salary was $8,000 higher than the regular starting salary, which we know to be $40,000.\n2. This means that Roberto has received a 200% raise. With this, we know that Roberto's current salary is equal to the starting salary of $40,0\n3. Finally, we have a question mark at the end of the line, which allows us to know that at this point, the value is still unknown, and therefore is a question.\n4.

We know that there are 22 of the items the box contains and we are asked about the boxes in general, not just the 22 items that are currently contained in the box. The height of the box is 12 inches and the depth is 3 feet, thus 12 / 3. The total 3-dimensional area is 3*12*3 = 18 cubic feet, which can be represented as 18*2*12.\nThe box has 22 items, so then the 22 items can be represented as 22/2*12, 22*6. The box can therefore hold 66 individual items. The height and breadth of the box are 12 and 3, respectively. Now let's use the fact that we know that the box can hold 66 items. The top, front and back of each foot of the box are three inches, so that 3*3=9. Each of the three feet of the box can hold 9/66 for the 3 dimensions, 9/2*12 = 18 * 2 for the 2 dimensions, and 9*3 = 27 for the height of the box.\nTherefore, the", "answer": " 3240"}

The ball doesn't have to cross within the strike zone.\n- \"Where the catcher can hold\" is not required in the question. We are not asking where the catcher can keep the ball. As such, this is a false statement that is illogical.\n- \"Where their chin is\" refers to the umpires' position with respect to the catchers chin. Thus, this is irrelevant to the question; it is not necessary to keep the strikers' chin in mind.\n- Therefore, we can safely eliminate answers A through E.

Choices:  A. 10 B. 8 C. 16 D. 14 E. 12 \n### Instruction and Demonstration: First, it's necessary to understand that the gender breakdown of 25 students in a class may not be balanced due to biological fact or personal preference. For instance, in the real world, there could be 25 children total, 12 being girls, and 13 being boys.\nSecond, it's necessary that we are clear about the meaning of the word \"four\" in the question.\nThird, notice how there is no reference to the number of boys in the first statement. In fact, this is an important fact that may aid in determining the answer to the question.\nFourth, the statement \"in a classroom of 5 children\" indicates that the gender breakdown is the same as the question we're asked - with four times as many girls.\nFifth, it can be eliminated that choice A: 10 can be excluded because there are 20% of the kids in the classroom,  so the statement that there are three times as many girls as the number of boys cannot be accomplished if there were only 10 girls.\n\nThe following is a step-by-step guide for answering the question:\n<ol>\n<li>Subtract out all the information used to form the answer.\nBecause the gender breakdown is already provided as being four times the number of boys, there is no need to subtract out that information to start forming an answer.\n<ul>\n<li>The statement that \"in a classroom with 25 children\" indicates that there are 25 total kids in the class.\n<li>\"With four times as many girls\" indicates that there are double the number of girls.\n<li>The girls were selected", "answer": " 18"}

Choices:  ___________\nRationales:  1. Since the ship can go 1:5 faster than the wind, the wind can go 5% slower than 1:9. \n2. Let's assume that we have an hourglass and every second of the hourglass is the \"wind\" and every sand grain is 1/5 of the speed of the hourglass. This can be broken down to each grain of sand being 1/5 of an hour.\n3. Since the ship can travel 15/19 faster, this means that is would take 5/(14/15)sand to go 15% of an hour or 15/14 of a grain.\n4. This means that the ship would take 15/13 times as long as it would take to go the same distance in the hourglass\n5. Since, the whole goal was to achieve 5% faster speed than the speed of the hour, we can just take 0.05 times that sand grain, (0.05 x 15/12).\n6.

Choices: 1: flooring and countertops\n2: house and carpet\n3: yard work and utilities\n4: electrical and plumbing\n5: heating and cooling\nRationales:\n1. When you purchase a home, the builder typically sells the home in an \"as is\" condition. However, most people want an updated home that contains some features, which are usually included in \"standard\" package deals. The choices that are consistent with this answer choice, and those features commonly included in a \"standard\" home, are: flooring and counter top. 2. Purchasing a home from a builder and \"owning a car\" are two separate aspects of home ownership. It's possible to own a home yet not own a car. Therefore, this choice is not correct. 3. Buying a home is one aspect of home ownership, while yard work and utilities are both aspects of home maintenance. Home maintenance is not consistent with owning a new residence, and also not included in standard home packages since maintenance is not a one-time payment like carpeting and flooring. 4. Electrical and plumbing aspects of home ownership are both included in the ownership process and not a single payment as carpeting and floors. However, the two answers given previously, choices 1 and 2, do also include electricity and plumbing. Therefore, the answer is not choice 4. 5. Heating and cooling are both aspects of homeownership but not included in standard home package deals, which is what the question states needs to be included to be a standard home sale.

So, 1750 2/3 of the number of hours = 881h, or 881/2 hours. If you add 12 hours with 881/108, you get 4 hours. Then, you multiply 12 hours with the number of times it was worked by Amber. Then, you multiply that total with 75/3: 3 times the total.

A panda birth cycle starts in the winter when the mothers and fathers get sexually active (mating).\n2. Each mating produces one baby.\n3. After mating only 25% of all the panda couples in the panda population become pregnant.\n4. To determine how many panda baby\u2019s are born, calculate how many pregnancies there are.\n5.

So, if there were 100 gallons of milk that could cover the whole surface, and it cost $25,000 per slice on the top, 10,000 slices could cover the whole surface?  That would only be $250,000.

If a 500-litre tank of gas holds 50 litres of gas, then 1000 times 50 is 5000 litres.\nThe tanks of gas should be able to fill 5000 balloon pieces, so he needs 500-5000 gas tanks to fully fuel them. In this case, 50 gas tanks are needed to fully fill all 5000 pieces of the equipment.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n* If John bought 1000 ballloons, each balloon could hold around 10 litres of air. This is implied in the question since if John bought balloons for thousands, he had to have been careful to fill every single balloon.\n* He did not specify how much gas the 5000 gas had to be to fill each ballloon. We assumed that each balloon needed to be filled with 10 litres, so that is what we will use.\n* He buys a large enough tank, but we cannot tell how large it is\n* Each tank is able to hold exactly 50 L of gas, so we put 50 in each balloon (not including the extra 49 L that the balloons hold)\n* We need to find a quantity of tanks to fill all of the balloons\n* We get the equation 5000 ballloones + tanks (500) + 10000 L of free space = 2 x 50 tanks (50)\n* We get 5000 = 1000 + 2 x50 so we need exactly 50 tanks\n\n### Input : You can't start any sentences with conjunctions.

{"text": "Six cows on the farm\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The word \"produce\" indicates that this is a non-random sample; the milk was measured, so we know exactly how much milk was produced.\n2. The answer choice \"10 cows on the farm\" makes no sense, as it would result in too much milk being produced to account for the results we were given. We know that the answer choice is not \"20 cows\", as the actual total amount of milk produced was 2160, which is higher than 2000. The sum of 108*5 + 2160 will be 312,000 liters, which is far beyond the 2160 we were told. Therefore, we can exclude answer choice \"10\" as incorrect.\n3. Answer choice \"6 cows\" makes sense because 108*6 + 216 is 6560 as opposed to 312000, which is 454 and 603 respectively. Therefore, the answer we'd be looking for is \"6 cows\", since this is the only one to make sense.\n4. Answer choices \"5 cows\" and \"3 cows\" don't make any sense, so they can be eliminated.\n5. Therefore, \"6 cows\" is the correct answer, and the answer choice is not 10 or 20.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe conclusion of this problem makes sense in context.

These flags can only be found in one place, which is the world, rather than, for example, a particular country.\nAnswer choice C can be eliminated for three reasons: this question would more appropriately be asking how you would find information about the flags within a country.

{"text": "8 + (8 x 1 x 0.5) = 2.5 hours\n\n### Response rationale:\n1. 1. First, break the problem down to help find an estimate.\nThe first thing to calculate is the number of hours for each load.  \nEach time we wash a load, it takes 45 minutes in the washer and  \nanother 60 minutes in the dryer, or 1 hour and 45 minutes each.  \nSo, each load takes one hour and 45 minute cycle, as indicated above.\n2. 2. The next thing to calculate is the total number of hours for completing the 8th load.  \nAfter 8 wash cycles, a load will be completed.\n\n3. 3. So, for 8 loads, after 8 hours of washing, there are 40 hours needed  \nfor the 8th load which is 7.50 hours.\n\n4. 4. Now, take this number and use it to start estimating the total number of hours needed.  \nWe know there are 8 loads in total, so in this example, after 40 minutes,  \nwe'll get to the 8th load, but in real-time, we don't know how many minutes it will take to complete each load.\n5. 5. So, since we don't know for sure at the 40th minute, let's say the 8th load  \nwill take another 1 hour and 15 minutes, the total time needed is:  \n8 hours + (8 x 45) + (8 x 60) + (8 x (1h15m))  \n8 hours (1)     x (8 x 40 min)  \n + (8 x 2.5h(1) + 6 60 min)  \n= (8 hours + (8x 2.5h + 480 min)  \n8h + (8x 8 h) + 480min)  \n= 2.5h (8) + 2 x 8 + 480  \n= 600 + 2h + 48 h  \n= 7.5h  \nHourly Total =", "answer": " 14"}

{"text": "The store had a clearance sale for $75. For $75, she bought 5 pairs shorts for $7 a pair, 2 pairs of shoeses at $10 each, and 4 tops for the same price. That means the total of the clothes she bought was $75 * 5 + $10 * 2 + $7 * 4, or $200.\n### Rationale: Let's take on Ann's purchases one at a time. Ann bought 2 pairs of shoees for $10 each ($10 * 2). If we plug those into the total shopping price of $200, then we get 75 + (10 * 2) = $200. That means each pair of shoes cost $10.\n### Second, we are given that Ann also bought 4 to top for the same price. If we multiply 10 to our previous equation, 75 + 10 * 4 = $200, and that means each top cost $7.\n### Lastly, we need to know how much each short cost. Remember, Ann purchased 5 pairs of short for a total price of $75. Each pair of short cost $7 each. If we plug 7 into the equation 75 + 7 * 5 = $200 (if everything previous is correct), then each short cost $7.\nHence, each of the tops were $7, whereas each of the shoes and shorts were both $10.", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "12.2 Seconds (60*5)/(60*5+10)\n### Input:Finding out how much the student loan costs in each country involves a few more steps. First, the interest rates will be found for each country by taking the country\u2019s main interest rate (10-year OAT) and dividing it by 10. This gives each country a percentage rate, from which a value can be found for simple annual interest. Once the simple annual interest is found for each country, we will be able to find the cost of the student loan for each country by multiplying each country\u2019s simple annual interest by 25 years. This will give each country an estimated debt per person and the cost of their student loan.\n### Response:The answer is C.\n### Explanation:\nThe calculation for 4 is: 10*(1/10) = 0.1; 0.1/10 = 0.01; 0.0125 = 0.125 %\nThe calculation for 3 is: 8*(1/5) = 0.4; 0.5/(0.6**2) = 0.691\nThe calculations for the other countries have an easy method. In order to get the percentage interest and to convert to simple annual interest, divide the number by 10.\nThe next step is to find the simple annual interest, by subtracting the 25 year simple periodic interest by dividing the previous calculation by 25. This will give you a simple annual rate of interest.\nThe last step will be to find the simple annual rate of interest to find out the principal and the interest payment. To find the principal and interest payment, multiply the simple annual interest rate by the total loan amount.\n\nThe calculations for 7 are: 4*(1/25) +/- 0.174 / 100; 2.48*0.174 = 0.39 = 0.3/10\nThe calculations for 5,6 are: 2*(1/2) +/- 0 8; 0.42*1.02 = 0.425 = 0,425/100\nThe calculation for 9 is: 0", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "The question asks about the number of fish Gail would have in the tanks if one of the fish eats another.\n\nEvaluating option (B), there are two possible interpretations:\n1) \"one gallon of water per one inch of fish.\" If one two-inch fish consumes another fish, then there would be an increase of 6 gallons of water and an increased population of three-inch fish in tank 1 but of two-inch fish in tank two.\n2) \"one gallon per inch of fish.\" In this case, if one two-inch fish eats another fish, the population of two-inch fish would simply drop from 48 to 47 (a reduction of one). The population of three-inch-fish in tank 1 would increase by 24.\n\nAs one of the two interpretations is wrong, the conclusion is inaccurate.\n\nIn evaluating option (A), we know that the original question mentions how many gallons of water were in tank 1 (48 gallons). If the 1-gallon-per-inch rule were true, then we would expect that tank 1 has 48 fish and tank 2 has 24. If, however tank 1 contained 48 fish, then the gallon per inch rule would cause the number of fish to decrease to 24, a discrepancy between the two options.\n\nAs tank 1 already had 48 fish prior to the change which is more than the resulting population if the fish eat each other, the conclusion is in error.\n\nOption (C) correctly concludes that one fish eating another, in fact, increases the population.\n\nOption (D) is a paraphrase of Option (C), and because it correctly states the desired conclusion, the explanation is acceptable.\n\nAnswer: Choice (C)  is correct\n\n### Instructions:Solve the equation.\n\n1+2*3+4+5*6\n\n### Response\n\nOption A:\n\nAnswer: (14+9) + (1-5) = 13", "answer": " 3"}

Choices:  a: look at clouds b: watch my child C: go on a date D: eat cake E: read a book\nRationales:\n1. In the question, we're told that when we're feeling depressed, we could do something to make ourselves happy.\n2. While clouds may make us feel better, they aren't exactly something you're able to do for 20 whole minutes. Hence, clouds cannot be the answer.\n3. It's also unlikely we will be on a date to make ourselves happy when we're feeling down. \n4. So now, we just have to take each option for being happy, that takes less than 20 minutes.\n5. Option B is to do something with a child. So it's not an option for making ourselves happy.\n6. When we're depressed, perhaps eating a home-cooked cake is a valid way to lift our spirits.\n7.

To the Pacific Ocean.\nRationales: In this case when water is used to fill a jug or bowl, it only flows from the tap to the jug. However, it is impossible for a tap to be directly connected to the gulf of mexico or the atlantic or pacific. Furthermore, if water fills a container on a stove, it goes down the drain which goes anywhere there is a drain and thus does not end up in the gulf, the atlantic or the pacific. There are no containers that end in the ocean that are small enough to fit on a stove. This is enough to eliminate all except the second and the last answer. If water is used to fill the sink, it ends up draining into the gulf if a faucet is used. So that is the best answer choice.\n\nA: 2\nB: 4\nC: 5\nD: 1", "answer": " 1920"}

{"text": "The average speed given that Conner rides his buggy a third of the time on each type of terrain is 58.4 miles per hour.  To figure this out, I began with the total time that Conner spends riding his buggy.  If he takes on flat land 1/3 of the time, he will also drive it 1/3 of that amount for a total of 0.33 times which will be 60 miles. Then, if he rides on downhill slop for 1/3 of his time, he will ride it downhill for 1/3 again. In total, he will ride for 0.66 times, or 66 miles. Finally, he goes up the hill for the final 1/3 part of his ride and rides it up a total of 0/3 times or 90 miles. Taking this together totals 201.6 miles.  Multiply this by 3/10 to normalize it per hour and you get 60.54 miles per hour. Then if you multiply 60.5 by 100 you can normalize it and get 6054 miles per hour as a result. Subtract the result of 6054 from the total 201.7 and you get 141.3 or 6.1 for your average speed.\n\n### Input\nRationales:\nThe question tells us that Conner takes on one-third of the terrain on flat sand. So we need to understand the question to see exactly what Conner takes on.\n\nIf he takes on flat sand 1/3 of 3rd of the time or 1/3 time 3/3 time which is 1/9.  Then 1/3 of this for the 3/9 of the time or 0.3 and 0.0933 times for the remainder.  So he travels on flat sand 18.2 miles per hour.\n\nThis process can be repeated for each type of terrain with the same answer.", "answer": " 58"}

A few things you could do, here, is rephrase the question by saying, \"the radio contest\" instead of \"the contest.\" To say \"the radio contest\" is to limit the scope of the contest. A contest is a contest no matter where it is being held. It still gives you two people the ability to ask, \"Do you want to enter the radio contest?\"\n\n### Demo-2: 2. This could even be made 2-6 depending on how you phrase it.\n\n### Demo3: 3.

{"text": "Gretel is making $2,500 more than Hansel.  Her raise is greater than his raise. Hansel is making $30,0 000. His raise is $3,000. Gretel is making $33,000, and her raise is $4,500.\n\n### Input\nThis might take a second to read, as the sentence in this problem is long and uses a lot of words to convey simple concepts. When analyzing this question, focus on what the problem asks. It specifically asks about money, and more specifically \"how much\" Gretel will earn more than Hansel.\n\n### Explanation\nAs we can see, the correct answer is \"Gretel makes $2,50 for every dollar that Hansel makes.\" We can use this as a formula, then plug in the numbers presented in the question. Hansel makes $30k a year, and Gretel makes $33k a year. The difference is $33,0 - $30,0 or $3,00. Gretels raise is $4,00 a year, or $15k - $11k or $4,000. \n\nTherefore, Gretel is making more: $33,0k - $30k or $3,0k = $2,50  So, Gretel makes $2500 more per year than Hansel. The way this information is formatted in the question is not particularly clear, as it uses many words to state that answer. The sentence could be worded better to remove unnecessary terms such as \"%\". \n\nThe main takeaway from analyzing this question is: the question asks how much more money Gretel will make, it does not ask about the increase as a percentage or as an increase. It merely asks about the actual number of more money Gretel makes, which is $2500 per year.\n\nAnswer: $2500\n\n### Input:\"What exactly is a fart?\", asked Alexi.\n### Demonstraion:\n\n### Expalnation:\n\n### Answer: It is a way of releasing gas from your stomach.\n\n### Notes:\n\n### Input,\"How much more", "answer": " 1500"}

{"text": "The two choices are $7.10 or $46.00.\n\n### Rationale 1:\nFirst you need to figure out how many small flags each person would get. There were 68 people invited. So 22 small flags plus 36 small flags plus the amount that Jay and Gloria get is 68. Therefore, the party will get 22 flags.\n\nNext you need to find the cost. There would be 35 small flags left because there are 22 flags for 68 guests, but the problem says their guests all want to get a flag. So 35 of the 5 flags for $0.50 left = $1.75. So the cost at the store for the flags is $1.75 per flag.\n\nOnce you know that, they would need 7.1 flags with the extra. Each additional.1 flags costs $1.66.\n\n### Solution:\nStart with 68 flags.\n\n1. 22 flags go to Jay and Gloria\n2. 46 flags go to 44 other people.\n\nIf you think this seems impossible, then you must consider that:\nEach guest will leave with at least one flag.\nAll of Guest X (and all of Guest X's guest) will leave with flags, and so forth.\nJay + Gloria will leave with at least two flags each.\nEach guest (minus the hosts) will only be able to take four flags if the hosts take two each. One flag for themselves, and then guests at 88.\n\n\nSo if 18 guests take 1 flag, 46 others take 3 flags, each host takes 4 flags, and 44 guests take 4 flags, that comes out to 71 flags.\n\nAt the craft store, $5 = 5 flags\n$5 + $5 + $1 + $1 + $0.80 each flag\n= $1.80 + $1.80\n\nWhich comes out to 43 flags.

{"text": "The answer to this question is that the company will need 192 bags of gravel. Each truckload of asphalt uses 2 bags of gralev, meaning that it will use 760 bags for each mile of road. This means that 60 miles of road were paved on day one, and that the company needed to pave 262 miles to finish the remaining road. This means that on day 2, the company paved a mile less than double than what was paved on the first day, which is 16 barrels of pitch. The company made 66 miles worth of progress on day 2, and needs to complete 296 miles left. Therefore, the company used 72 * 16 = 1192 bags, so the company needs 808 bags to complete the remaining work on day 3. On day 3, it uses 3 truckloads of asphalto pave 760 bagger per mile of road, so it uses 1 350 1004 * 2 = 700 truckload to complete the work. Therefore, it needed 700/ 750 = 0.92 truclads of asphalt to finish the 760 baskets per-mile of road and 760 * 700 = 544 000 baskets to finish the 75 miles of road. Since each truck uses 2 baskets, it means that the truck needs to make a total of 272 000 bags at least, each truck needs to make 1 360 009 bag. 1 361 009 bags for each truck means 3 483 008 total bags required to finish the 700 trash for each 75 miles. Since the company used 1 353 005 baskets for the first two distances, it needs to make 118 387 bags.

{"text": "54 minutes\n\n### Rationales\n1. Choice \"A\" - 21 minutes - Tony can assemble a widget in 90 minutes, but he worked only for 8 hours yesterday, which equals 8 * 90= 720 minutes. We know that \"Tony worked the entire 8 hours shift\", so we subtract that number to get 68 widgets = 68 * 90 = 6140 minutes = 61.4 hours OR 100 * 0.10 (Sam's speed) = 10 hours\n2. Choice \"B\" - 54 minutes - First, choose A for Tony's time as it is the faster option. Then, 6 * 68 =  392 widgets were completed by Sam and Jack. This takes Tony 392 / 3 * 90 =  13 days. We remove this number from the total (10 hours) to get the correct answer (4 hours and 26 minutes or 54 minutes). 10 hours - 13 days = 4 hours and 23 minutes.

We can eliminate option A, because when that happens, we have a case where one parent has zero children, or that would make the math not work.\n2. Thus, choice B could very well be the correct answer, where we get a 8 by 7 grid, which is 56 children.\n2. However, when you multiply that by 2, we get a total of 304 children.\n3. 304 + 2 = 306, and because 306 doesn't fit the number of grandkids we started off with, we need to rethink this.\n4. Thus we consider option C\n5. Now, when we add 56 by 56, that equals 3046, which is too much, according to the problem, with only 42 grand children.\n6. Also, there are more than 2 parents in this generation, so we can eliminate option D.\n7. Now we move to option E, where we have a case where there is no multiplication, which is great, because this is the most concise answer.\n8. However, we need to eliminate any cases where this doesn't work out, so option D is most definitely a case where multiplication doesn't apply, so that's out.\n9. We also have a case where someone has 0 children, which seems impossible, and would likely ruin the whole premise, so we can eliminate A.\n10. Last, we can eliminate option C, because if there are two parents with 5 each, then one parent would technically have less, which doesn't fit the format, so C is out. \n11.

{"text": "Maria must earn $200 in order to buy the bike.\n\n### Rationales:To answer this question, we need to know two things. First, what is the cost of the bike? And second, how much must Maria earn to buy it. \n\nThe first part of the question provides us the answer. The price of the bike, $600, is the same as the amount of money Maria has saved toward the purchase. \n\nThe second part of the question is where we are given a clue for the answer and the process for figuring out how much to earn. This clues us into the fact that Maria will need $200 more to fulfill her goal of making enough money to buy the bike, and that her mother is contributing $250 and wants her to figure the rest out, for a total of $450. \n\nNow, we must calculate what the $200 is to buy the bike or how much she needs to make. The correct answer, $200, works out to be how much of a percentage of the total sales price of the bike Maria is going to have to earn. \n\nLet's explain the answer using these numbers, keeping in mind the answer is $200, and not $200.00, as that number doesn't make any sense here. Here's what goes down. \n\n$600 / 200 = 3\n3 * 100 = 300\n300 - $250 = 50\n$50 / $600 = 0.1666...\n0.1667 * 100% = 16.66%\nIn this problem, Maria is trying to figure out how she can buy a bike for $600, by earning money working during the holidaze. She has $120 in the bank, which is a contribution of 20% of the sales price. Her mom gave her $250, which is a contribution amount of 40% of the sales value. Maria is now responsible for earning the remaining $200 by working during the holiday. If she only earned $200, it would mean that she earns exactly 33", "answer": " 230"}

This info tells us that there is 30 min. allotted for making pizza d and 30 min. for pizza to cook, totaling 60 min.\n2. Step 2 is to identify all parts of the problem, here, it says: if one batch of pizza can make three pizza but the oven can fit 2 pizza at a time, how long would it take for Camila to make 12 pizza. so the question contains two parts 1. make pizza d - 30 2.

Step 3: In order to find the answer, we need to identify the given conditions. for example, we know 1.it takes 50 min. to make 3 pizza, 2. 30 min to cook, 3. if Camila make a batch of d then she can make 3 pizza at 1 time. The last condition, given on question says Camila has to make 12pizza, now we have conditions and we need to find answer by using the given equation (the same condition that is given to us), from above 2 conditions we get: pizza d = 3, cook = 30, that gives us : 3 +30 = 33. Now we have 33 conditions, here we need to figure out, first condition 3+30= 33, 25, then we proceed to third condition 30*3= 90, then 30 +90 = 120, that gives us 9 and 3 and 25, in order to find any answer we need to find the difference between given conditions, for which we need to subtract given conditions (pizza d *cooking time)", "answer": " 5"}

The head must be a multiple of 6. Since it is greater than 3, it can't be a fraction. However, the head has a length of 6 ft. and, given its proportion to the total length of the fish, must be 6 or 12 ft. The fish's average body length is 49.5 ft.\nB) The fish's total body length is 6 in. greater than the fish's average head and tail lengths combined, and it has a total body length that's the same as its average body length.

{"text": "He paid $300.\n\n### Detailed Response: In this problem, we're told James bought 20 pounds of steaks, which is equivalent to 30 pounds of steaks. He paid $15 per pount ($15\u00d730) for his steaks, which is $450 total ($450/15) to get his meat. The question doesn't say how much he paid for taxes, however, if there is a tax included with the B1G1 sale, James will end up paying slightly less for steak. Let's say the total cost was $450, of which we know $45 was tax since $450\u00f715=30. James would have paid $300 for 30 pounds of meat ($300\u00d7150). If there was an additional tax on the whole purchase that amounts to $35, James paid $385 to buy his meat ($300+$35). The wording of the question is ambiguous because the problem doesn't specify which pounds James bought, so the correct answer is B.", "answer": " 150"}

{"text": "The zoo spent 4 hours recovering all the animals.\n\n### Justification:First, we must recognize that the statement 3 lions and 3 rhinos escaped is ambiguous, as it is a combination of quantifiers and nouns, which may be confusing. \n\nSecond, we must determine the number of animals that escaped in total. We can figure this out because the question states \"If it takes 2 hours,\" and the animals didn't escape until a total of 2 hours. This means the total number of escaped animals is **2**.\n\nThird, we look at how long each animal took to recover (it takes 2 hours to \"recover\" each type of animal). The total amount of time spent recovering animals can only be 2 hours, as we'll explain below. \n\nWith 3 lions, we have (3 lions * 2 hours) = 6 hours.\n\nWith 2 rhinos, we have (2 rhinos * 2 hours) * 100% = 4 hours.\n\nAdd the above two equations, and we get: (3 lions * (6 hours) + 2 rhinos * (4 hours)) = 2 hours \n\nOur final and correct answer is **4 hours**.", "answer": " 10"}

We also know that she will have fewer tokens than any of her sibling since she is splitting the remaining 1 million tokens among her 4 other siblings.\nSimply put, Sandy is giving away 900, thousand tokens and splitting 100,00 tokens among her siblings, thus leaving herself more tokens than the other 4 siblings. \nSandy does not consider just giving up the 900, thouands (or 90%) of Safe Moon tokens.

For each year, this airport will get 10.5 million additional in use passengers than the next busiest airport. \nIn total, this means that each year, Amsterdam Airport Schiphall will host an additional 54 million passengers.\n\n### Since the question asks for \"How much longer does the busies airport stay busy\" each year, this means that we want to add the time. 54 million passengers a year. \n\n### Answer: 306 million passengers a year, which is the time it takes for Amsterdam Airport Schiphalla to be twice as busy as the next busiest airports.\n\n### Input \"Why isn't there a busiest airport in the south of the United States?\"\n\n### Rational:Airports in the south are not the most in use/busiest airports in the United States. \n\n## Input: Why is there no busiest airport?", "answer": " 220"}

Statements consist of a subject and a predicate. The predicate is the verb. In spoken language, the subject and predicate are often separated by a verb, which is called a preposition. The most important verb is always the verb that tells us what is being said. Other important verbs in a sentence are those that tell us when something occurred and how much or how many of something is being said.\nWhat is being said is the subject. The speaker or reporter is generally the subject of a statement. The predicate is being reported. Weather forecasters say they're reporting what the weather will be tomorrow.

{"text": "The answer is six meters total. First, we subtract one from the 4 meters of the width, which leaves 3. Then we add 1 to that number (3 + 1 = 4). Now, we square the 4, which leaves 16 square meters. Subtract 1 from the square root of 16, and that leaves 2.5; 4 divided by 2.5 equals 1.6, which must be rounded halfway to 1.6 meters per side.

Choices: \nA: I'm from Texas B: a friend of mine is from Texas C: I have the same name as a character from that sitcom D: the friend is real\nRationales:\n1. A friend who has the same name as the character can still be real, even if the character is from Texas, 2. the character I'm referencing could be from another state, and the friend could have the same name. 3. Since people don't necessarily name their children after characters in a sitcom, this could be a coincidence, it is likely the character referenced is not based on a real person, and 4. Finally, there are many sitcoms set in other states, so naming a character after this state can still be a choice for characters.\n\nAnswer: B: a friend of Mine is from Texas\n\nInput: In which of these is there the most space at the left margin?

A person is thirsty. This tells us that they should drink water to cure their thirst.\n6.\nNext, we look at each option to determine if they make sense.\n7.\nOption A: \"drinking water with their hands\". This suggestion does not make sense. If a person is thirst, water should be used to quench that thirst. Hence, using their hands is an unlikely option to do so.\n8.\nChoice B - \"open their mouth and drink oral\". It's unclear what this means. If we assume that drinking orally means drinking through the mouth, then this is a valid choice to select.\n9.\nChoice C: breathe through the mouth. The thirsty person should not breathe into their own mouth, as this is unnecessary.\n10.\nChoice D: \"sip water gently\". This is also a good answer, because water should be sipped gently to avoid wasting it.\n11.\nFinally, choice E: pick up a drink with fingers.

{"text": "Julia has $45 because $1 was not included in the transaction\n\n### Instructions:Solve the equation shown.\n\n### Rationale:First, we need to clear up what the question is asking. The question states \"Julia has $42. She spends half...\" indicating that Julia has more than 42 dollars, she is just planning on spending and re-saving a portion of her money such as 50% or 25%. \nIt is unclear what she spends and how this affects the equation. \n\nWe also notice that the word \"transaction\" was left over in the equation, but this is not a part of the question so we can eliminate this as well. \n\nNext, we look at the options to eliminate any incorrect information. \n\nOption A - \"1/3 - 1/4\" indicates that she is only spending a third of the money and saving out a quarter, a clear impossibility due to the math.\n\nOption B - \"2/10\" is also impossible because if only 20% in total is spent, each option shows only 20%. \n\nOption C - \"1/2 \u2013 2/4\" shows more like the question, and does in fact show that she spent half. She would still have $42.\n\nOption D - \"3/5 + 1/8.25\" uses the numbers $42 and $45. However, both numbers show the correct output $42, so this must be incorrect as well.\n\nOption E - \"4/7.75\" uses a different number again, this time being $45. However again, this shows the correct output $45. \n\nTherefore, the only answer that makes any mathematical sense is E \u2013 \"4/7.5\"\n\n### Rationales:\nThis problem is clearly asking what Julia\u2019s new balance is. Julia started with $42 and spent $41.5 on the purchase of the game.\n\nHer new balance after spending the amount was $1 left over. The original 42 is represented in the equation by 1/4.\n\nThis means that when she split 42, she spent half and saved the other half.

{"text": "Answer the question. It may be useful to rewrite the entire sentence with the numbers in the question.\nThe question asks Stephanie how many candles she needs to completely cover the birthday cupcakes. Answer choices:  A: none because there are more candles than needed\nB: 30\nC: 60\nD: 120\nE: 0\nI found this question kind of hard because I spent a good amount of time working on the logic behind the question. We must know all the information given to properly formulate the answer.\n\n### After working out the logic and process to solve the question, you can see that in a way, 24 equals 6 times 4. Because there is 1 birthday cupcake per each candle, 30=4. Therefore, 24= 8, which is too small of a number.\n\n### \n\n### Final Response: In the sentence, we can see that there are 24 cupcakers to be covered. Thus, we can use the distributive property with n= number, r= repitition of something, = to make a sum.  There are 12 cupcake each with 2 candles and 12 with 1. This makes 24 total cupcakes. The 30 candles are used, so we need 6 more. 6 x 2=12.

First, consider the options: where could one go to see the Hamilton show?\n2. \"A: a theater\" does not work because the show is only on Broadway, not necessarily at a theater.\n3. \"B: Facebook\" may work, but there is no reason to expect that Facebook is the best source of discount codes. \n4. \"C: the internet\" is a bit vague, but it may be the case.

{"text": "The plane would require 1319 gallons of fuel. After Carol figures out how much fuel each variable adds, the next step is finding the sum.\n\n### Input/Rationale:\n1. Start by finding the value of each variable and how many each one has. You can do this by rearranging the equations in order to determine the variable. Then figure out which equation has which variable in what order it will be in after determining the variable.\n2. The plane would require 32 gallons to cover every mile by each passenger and 7 gallons more per passenger by each bag. So the plane would run 35 gallons per mile.\n3. However, there are 30 people and 5 crew members. If 35 gallons is used by each passenger, the plane would require about 1055 gallons. You can do this with algebra.\n4. The last step is rearranging each of the equations to find each variable to find the fuel needed.\n    * For each person: (gallons per mile x passengers) = gallons needed every mile.\n    * For every bag: (gallons needed every mile) + (gallons every miles per bag) = gallons for each bag.\n5. It turns out that the plane needs about 145 gallons in a total of 400 miles.\n6. You then use the value 145 for each of the individual equations to solve for each variable.\n    * For the passenger equation, there are 35 gallons needed per mile, so 145 gallon is needed for 400 miles:\n```\n  145 = 35 x 20\n  7370 = 6400 + 700\n   6770 = 700\n```\n    \n    * For the equation for each bag, there are 34.9 gallons needed for every 400 miles with the extra 12 gallons for passengers:\n```\n  34.9 = 35 x (145/400) + 12\n  54.16 = 71.33\n```\n    \n7.

First, let\u2019s determine the overall speed and duration of Tom\u2019s swimming: 2 hours at 2 mph = 24 miles Tom has traversed in two hours.\nNext, let\u2019s determine how long Tom runs at double his speed: 4 hours = 16 hours remaining Tom then runs for half the remainder, or 8 hours, halfway between the 4 hours he has covered swimming and the total remaining period of 16 hours.\nTherefore, Tom ran for 8 hours at approximately 4 mph. Tom\u2019s overall speed = 4 mph and his duration was 16 hours. Therefore, Tom covered 16x4 = 64 miles total.\n\n### Rationale:\nLet\u2019s determine the speed that Tom starts at:\n\n1. 2\u00d760 minutes = 120 minutes Tom takes 2 hours to swim 60 minutes. Therefore, his initial speed = 1 mph\n2. 1\u00d75 = 5 inches This is Tom\u2019s duration.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate Tom\u2019s interval speed when he runs:\n1. 4\u00d760 = 240 minutes Tom runs at approximately 4 mps for 240 minutes or approximately 4 hours.\n2. 2x4x5 = 20 inches This is the duration of Tom\u2019s running.\n\n3. 2x4 = 8 inches This is the half-way point of Tom\u2019s running at 4 mph.\n\n4.

{"text": "(2)(6) \u2212 18, leaving 3\n\n### Rationale:\nFirst, determine the options for each of the choices and evaluate the solutions individually.\n\n1. For the first choice (A: yards of ribbon, the most reasonable answer would be 18, however it would not be of any use since it does not have 6 gifts it does not work out, because of this this is ruled out as a possible solution.\n\n2. There are two choices for the second. First is (B: 6(yards of ribbon), in which, for the number of gifts, 6, and the amount of ribbon 18, would provide a possible solution. However if we solve this, we get 108 and when this is divided by the original amount, we get 2 yards. This doesn't work because there is not enough ribbon to distribute to all gifts equally. The second possible choice is (C: 2 *6) which would provide possible solution. However to distribute evenly would require 8 yards of ribbon, instead, this is not possible so this is counted out as well.\n\n3. The options for the second question consists of two choices, (D: 2 * 5), and (E: 1.5 * 5), it is logical to suppose that if each person has 2 yards of ribbons, then each gift will have 1.5 yards of ribbon as well, after we divide the initial 18 yards of Ribbon by this amount, we get 12 yards and since 2 * 5 is an integer, 2 * 5 = 10, however after you take the number remaining from the original, you get 2 and if you apply this ratio, 12/2 this means that you can provide 3 yards of ribbon to every person.\n\n4. The options for the third question, would consist of the two choices (F-G: 13.6 - 5.2), we take the original 18 and we get 2 yards of ribban, and once we get the integer part (13.6) we get the integer for 6 gifts (7). So (13.6 -7) = 6.6. If you divide this number by the ratio 6/1 we get 1", "answer": " 6"}

Since Eden carried 4 so did Mary which means Iris carried only one fewer, which is why Eden carried 3 more than Iris because Mary carried 3 more. \n\n    * F: This can also be eliminated using the same math test as E: if each bucket contained 2 lbs of sand, and Iris carried 1 fewer bucket than Mary, we can assume Mary carried 2 more to make up the difference and not Mary carried 1 more. \n\n2.

The first part of the question is:\n\n`If Ricki removes 10 Apples`\n\n3. The second part of the question is about Samson:\n\n`and Samson removes twice as Many as Ricki.`\n\n4. My answer for how many are left is 7.\n\n5. This means I subtracted 1 from the original amount of apples: 74 - 1 = 73\n\n6. Next I need to decide how many Apples Samson took out:\n\n14 + 2 x Ricki's amount = 24\n\n7. Then I need to figure out how much apples I take Out from Ricki:\n\n10 - 14 = -4\n\n8.

Choices: \nA: 20 minutes B: 30 minutes C: 40 minutes D: 50 minutes E: 60 minutes\nRationales:\n1. The distance to travel is 5 miles, which is the denominator in the ratio. Therefore it's in the fractional part.\n2. The velocity component of the ratio is 45 miles per hours, the numerator.\n3. In order to solve this problem, we have to divide both sides of the equation by the denominator which is the distance covered, not by the velocity, since it is the numerator and we can't divide it by the denominator as the equation shows how fast you're going, not how far you're going.\n4. We know that we should divide both sides of the division with the number that is in the denominator which in this case is 5, which implies that we divided the 5 miles with the 45 miles per second, and therefore we just simply said 45/5=9 and 10/0.5(which is the denominator of 5 mile) would give us the same number which is 10 or 10 minutes as the answer is.\n\n### Input :\nThe total weight of a passenger plane is 70 kg, not including the cargo.

{"text": "You could plug 600 into 1 square feet and get 600 because the question asked a gallon for every 600 square ferr, so that 600 square has to cover 1 gallon, so you divide it by one and then you see that that's enough.\n\n### Input\nA farmer sowed some seeds and had nine of his best pigs and a little piglet. In total, the little pig found 55 seeds. It is impossible, however, for the nine pigs to have found a greater number. Thus, how many seeds each pig found can be divided in a certain way, and the pig with the smallest number of seeds finds exactly five times the number.\n\n### Response\nIn order to find how many seeds each animal found, we take 55 as our starting point because, as the question says, a little pig has 55 seeds and so does everybody else. We know that there are 10 animals so the rest of them have as many seeds as the remaining seeds. So, this is the first step we want to make, 55-9, our little pig has 46 remaining, the second pig gets 21, the third pig gets 15, the fourth pig gets 9, the fifth pig gets 6, the sixth has 3, the seventh has 1, the eighth has 1, the ninth has 0 and lastly, the tenth has 0. \nThe last number is important and needs to be multiplied by 5 before we find out the total and to get the seeds of each animal. To get the answer, we multiply by 5 every number except for 1,0, and 0. As I said, we already know there are 10 numbers and it was divided by 9, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0 and 0, so we add all of these up and our answer is 53. We can then divide by 6 and our answer is the minimum number of seeds each animal found and this is because the little pig is only 5 less. Therefore, we divide 53 into these 6 animals to find out the minimum number of seas the aniamis found and the answer is", "answer": " 3"}
{"text": "Ben can build at most 40 rocking chairs in 10 days.\n\nInput:Which of the following is the best answer to the question: Is there a place where we can be free to eat as much as we want? Choices: \nA: grocery store B: all the time C: restaurant D: home E: restaurant buffet\nRationales:\n1. The question is asking \"Is there a place where we...\" and not, \"What place...\" \n2. In the context of this question, we'd likely be looking for a place where we could potentially be free to eat as often as we want.\n3. Answer selection \"A: grocery stores\" does not make sense, as we do not have freedom to eat much as we want in grocery store.\n4. Answer selection \"C: restaurants\" is also an incorrect answer, because we are not searching for a place where we can eat all the time. Answer selection \"D: home\" is also incorrect, as it does not indicate freedom to eat as much as one wants.\n5. Answer selection \"E: restaurant buffet\" indicates that one can come to eat all one wants, but the \"home\" selection would still be free to eat anything desired due to the \"as much as we want\" part of the question.\n6. Therefore this answer can be answered with \"E. restaurant buffet; we can eat everything as much as we want\".\nAnswer:\nE: restaurant buffet\n\nInput: Where should we go to get healthy snacks?

{"text": "140 cups\n\n### Input and Output Connector:\nIn this prompt, we have two problems that have the same solution. The first asks us to identify the number of pallets of one type of paper product, while the other asks us to find the number of pallets containing paper cups. If we solve the first problem, we can solve the second one too as long as we know how many pallets were distributed of each different type of paper product. \n\nWe can see from the context of the first question that half the pallets are paper towels, one-quarter are tissues, and two-fifths are paper plates. There are a total of 110 paper products, so we're looking for a 110-piece pallet. We need to subtract the number of paper products represented by each type of product, and solve for our answer. \n\nThe number pallets of towels is 110 - (50/2) = 16 pallets, which leaves us 740 paper towels. So we can subtract (25/5) from 740 to find that two-fifths of the towels will go over to the other pallets which leaves us with only 400 paper towels per pallet. We can eliminate two of the pallets because we know that half the pallets were towels, and the rest are cups (or plates or tissues). \n\nThe number of tissues is 110- (25/5), which leaves us with 460 tissues per pallet. We already know that there are 400 paper cups left, which means that each of these pallets includes 60 cups of paper. This leaves us with 100 cups, which is 20 pallets more than we need. The correct answer is 140 cups per pallet. \n\n### Feedback:\nThis explanation is a little long, but it explains the process step by step. The explanation is also a little hard to follow, mostly because it does not identify or label each part in simple bullet points. This leaves the explanation difficult to scan and understand. Additionally, a picture would have added visual appeal to the explanation. On the other hand, the answer is the correct one.", "answer": " 1"}

Each container of candy canes costs $50.  If Anna pays for each package of candy canes by adding its total price divided by the number of packages, how much money will Anna have in her wallet after giving a bag containing 4,000 cute cocoa?\n\n### Answers:260 dollars\n\n### Rationales:The question tells us Anna bought two packages containing 450 candy canes total. Now we need to find the answer in terms of Anna's $50 total payment for each package. We divide 12000 by 2 and get 6,000, then we multiply 6,00 by 50.6 and get 300 dollars. Now, we divide 15000 by 1 and get 1500, then we multiple 1500 by 5 and get 7,500. So, using Anna's payment method, 7,50-$300=4,600.

To do this, we first know that the current price of the used bike is 69 dollars less than the price used to be.\n\nWe know that this means the list price of the bikey was", "answer": " 46"}

{"text": "Let x be Malcom's total number of cards before he traded half of them to Mark. Then, since Malcom also has 8 more cards, we know that  x + 8 =20. This equation can be simplified to 3x = 20 or 3x \u2013 20 = -20, and so x = 6.  Therefore, Malcom\u2019s original number of cards were 20 less than Brandon\u2019s and then he had to trade half of them to Mark, but now he has 6 cards.\n\n### Explanation:First is to express the relation of the two given quantities. It could be stated as Malcom has fewer cards than Brandon. Or  Malcom has 20 less cards than Brandon.\n\nNext, it is important not to make too many assumptions in the first statement. Therefore, consider that the situation is given that Malcom does not have 20 less cards because we will come back to using that number in another manner.\n\nThen, we look at the given scenario of Malcom trading away half of his cards. The statement \u201cMalcom gives half of his\u201d is ambiguous and can mean either Malcom is giving Mark all of half of his cards or a fraction of half of his cards. We know that Malcom had 6 cards since he got 8 cards and he only had to give half of 6, therefore that means the fraction is.\n\nThat means, after Malcom\u2019s exchange with Mark, he has \ud83d\udcc8\n6 + \ud83d\udcc9\n8 \ud83d\udcc9 = -20.  We can put this into a fraction, since we are dealing with only whole and half numbers in our calculations. Therefore, it becomes \ud83d\udcc9 \n\n1/(6 \ud83d\udcc9 + 8)\n\ud83d\udcc9. We are trying to isolate the \ud83d\udcc9, so we use division (\ud83c\udf97), which reduces this fraction to \ud83d\udc46 \n\nThen, we know the given variables.

Choices: \nA: 5-10 B: 16 8 C: 200 6 D: 50\nRationales:1. The first thing we must realize is that the 8 in the option A is wrong. If we take the example of 'two' and add 'eleven', the answer wont be 'twelve' it will be 12 as two can only be added with one. Similarly one will have to realize that addition in this case will be the same for A, B, C and D.  1. First, let us eliminate some choices. 2. The \"plus\" in each of the four options is clear that it will add the values. 3. Option B is the only choice with a value greater than 10. The question is asking about adding one value with another. For example, if 1+5=6. 4. Option C is too large to be possible. The value of each letter is either 1 or 5. This gives us a maximum output of 110 if both A and B equals 5. 5. Option D is the smallest option. However, it could reach the maximum output of 50. 6. If both A and B =5, then A+B=10,C+D=13. 7. If either one of A or B equals 10,then the equation is solved. The equation becomes: B = C + D. 8. By this, one can find the value of B which the maximum is 10. Then the answer is A+B = 10+10 = 20. 9. But, if we compare both options C and D, C is larger so the answer will be A+B = 20+6 = 26. 10. Finally, 20-26=6 will be the answer.\nAnswer: 10 is added", "answer": " 95"}

She said that it might go on longer than what is normal for these concerts, and that it wouldn't be a simple or boring one-piece concert. \n\n### Demand:What concert performance does the sentence concern?\n\n### Rationales: \n\n1. First, we have to identify the concert performance that Lisa is referring to.\n2. One concert performance for the sentence refers to a music performance by one person, usually in a small venue or event. In contrast, a concert generally denotes a multi-performer event.\n3. In the context of the question and response the option \"A. a one-off concert B. a live concert\" is the correct answer because, if Lisa had said it might not be a \"one-off\" or \"one piece\" performance, she was referring to a concert. \n4. Therefore, \"a one-off concert\" and \"a live concert\" are the two options that are in the context of the sentence, which would make answer choice \"a one-off-concert\" the correct answer.\n5. In short, the proper answer to this question is: A. a one-off-conert\n\n### Demands:You can see that it was not a simple or boring on-off-concert.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Simple and boring would only refer to a one-off- concert, so we can eliminate the incorrect answer choices that suggest a \"live concert\", which would be too generic.\n2. The second answer is correct because it's a way to explain exactly why the concert wasn't simple or boring at the time it was given. \n3. Therefore, the correct choice \"It was not a simple or a boring on-off concert.\" will apply to the context of the original sentence.\n4. \"A. It was not a simple or simple concert B. It was not a boring or boring concert\" are both incorrect because simple and boring don't really apply to a whole concert except a one-off- performance.\n5.

{"text": "The answer can be found by working back from the question. We can say for certain that the ship was at least 847 people, as that was the total number of people eaten by the monster over the entire time. The only other information we are required to answer this question, is the monsters feeding frequency. \n\nThe ship was at least 240 years late to the party. We can then start multiplying 240 x 2, for every 100 years, to see if we can get as close to 847 without going over. \n\nThis gets us to 832.24. So the ship must have had somewhere between 847 and 832 people on board. \n\nThis means that on the first 100 years that the monster was eating, 847 to 832 people were eaten.

So over the 10 years, it ate people up to the number of people on the first 1-10 ship, and then kept going from the last 10 ship. \n\nThis would mean that the monster was consuming more people overall per 100 hundred years, but it is possible for the first ship to be the worst time, as it ate the most people, and the worst ship is 133 people in 100 years.", "answer": " 121"}

This means that initially there are 60 gumballs, because Hester initially took 6 and by the end of the distition he will have four more and therefore to give to the other 3 boys he will continue multipating the amount, this means that the starting amount is = 60 (first distition)\n\nHestar took twice as many as he took to Todd to Alisai, this means 3 to: Todd, Alia and 4 to: Bobby, so that means the amount is increased by three: first, by 3 to Todd and Alisai, and then by Todd, Alisai and 4 to Bobby, that's why we take the starting amount and divide it by (4/3), first the starting amount is 60, then we divide them by (4/3) = 15 that is, is added to 45, then there are 60-15 + 45 = 120.\n\nTo find out how many times Hester gave them to Bobby, we use the formula: amount = (4 to Bobby x 4) - 2", "answer": " 45"}

That could be the case, but that doesn't mean they won't look in the window.\nC: between the wall and bedsheed: We can eliminate this answer because the bedsheets aren't the walls, so therefore there wouldn't be bedsheets between the wall and another wall. No matter which bedsheed and no matter how thick the bedsheed is it's simply not possible for that to happen between the walls.

One of these ways is to use the formulas we were given and perform the computation:\n\n\nRosie's mileage per hour = 6 miles per hour\n\nRosie ran the week on:\n\n\nMonday: 6 times 1 = 6 miles\n\nTuesday: 25% of 6 times 1 hour = 0.25 times 6 = 1.5 miles\n\nWednesday: 100% of 6 times = 6 miles\n     \nThursday: 10% of 6 = 0.6 miles\n\nFor a total of 14 miles ran\n\nIf Rosie's aim is to run 20 more miles that following Friday:\n\n\n\nRosis must run for at least 20 miles in that Friday.\n\nSo 20 miles in the Friday must be ran at least for 30 minutes.\n\n\n### Another way of approaching the question is to firstly compute the \"running time\" for 1 mile in minutes. From this total, you can then easily calculate from the weekly total how many minutes Rosie needs to run next Friday.\nFirstly we shall find the average of all running times throughout the week:\n\n\n$$AverageRunningTime = \\frac{\\sum x}{N} = \\frac{8.5}{\\{1,2,2,1\\}} = 2.5 $$\nThe average calculation above is to account for weekdays (2 days) and for weekend days (2 days). \n\nFor instance, if $x$ and $N$ are $1$ and $2$, respectively. Then, $AverageRunningTime$ is calculated as $\\frac{1}{2}$, which is $0.5$.\nThe average running time was calculated to be $2.5$, and now that you know this value, you can use to compute the running time for 1 mile.\n\nNow is the time to calculate 1 mile in minutes:\n\n$$Distance / RunningTime = TimeToFinish\n  so\n3.1 (miles)  / 2.5 (", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "15 days\nFirst off, let's consider how Emery and Serena can read the book in 15 days.\nSince it takes Serena 20 days to finish one part of the book, there would be 50 days left over (since he reads 5 times faster). On the other hand, Emery can finish this in 5 days. Therefore, there are 9 more days to go to finish up the book.\nSo, in order to have 15 days, we need 3 more. Therefore, it can be answered that they can have 15 days in 18 days, so the answer would be 18.\nHowever, there is one more concept we need to tackle: Average. It is stated specifically that it is the average time taken to read the book. So, for every 18 days, one of them would have finished reading the first part, and could pick up another half so that there are more parts left, hence, they have to read 15 days altogether.

Since 25 eggs + 8 eggs = 33 eggs, there was a total number of 29 eggs to distribute to each adult and each child. Therefore, the answer to (A) is 1.\nAfter distribution was completed, each adult had 1 egg left over and each child had an extra egg left over, so there were 28 eggs remaining. Since there were two more girls on the trip than boys on the trip, that means there were 9 girls and 7 boys on the trip. Therefore, (B) is not correct.\nThe question asks for the total number of boys, not the total number on the trip, so (C) is not correct. \nWith each girl having 2 additional eggs than each boy, that means there were in total 4 extra eggs to give boys.

From the information given, we know that Chandler needs to buy 12 rolls, but he has only sourced 10 from other buyers.

The profit was 42, which we then divided it by 60 to arrive at the final total.\n\n#### Step 3: Answer: \n\n\n\nWe start by making the final profit into an equation by subtracting 2 sets of parentheses.  We do this using this basic equation (60, 42) or [3.5,42].

{"text": "Answer: 6 hours\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. We know that the total time to watch the two movies equals the length of the first movie plus 30 minutes.\n2. We know that the preparation time for the first movie, including popcorn, equals the length of the second movie plus 20 minutes.\n3. We now let time = x.\n4. We know that the time to watch the first movie only is half of the total time. So we set time to x/2.\n5. Substituting time for x/2 in the equation for the preparation total time, we get the time to watch the second movie and to make popcorn x/2 + 2x/4.\n6. Time to watch the second movie is given as x + 30, which when substituted for x and combined with the equation for the 2nd time it is: \n(x/2 + 2 x/4) + (x + 30) = x/2 + 3x.\n7. Solving for time tells us that time = 50/3.\n8. Multiplying 50/3 or 50/12 by the number of minutes in one hour yields that time = 5 hours.\n9. We now subtract 10 minutes of prep time. This 10 minutes was only for the first movie, so it does not subtract away from the total time to watch both movies. Instead, it subtracts 5 minutes away from the second movie and the additional 5 minutes away from prep time, making it 20 minutes total.\n10. Therefore, time = 5 - 10 = 4 hours.\n11. Adding a 10 minute break in between the movies allows four hours total watching time for both movies.\n12. As such, the correct answer is A: 4 hours.", "answer": " 4"}

Choices:  E: eyesight depends only on a person\u2019s age  C: eyesight is greater among older people D: eyesight is only affected in old age B: eyesight can be better at any age\nRationales: The choice which best describes the relationship between ones eyesight and their Age will have to describe how each age group correlates to eyesight.\n6. \n\n1. A says there is only one way in which eyesight depends on age. This is false as there are four ways in which this occurs, and it also doesn\u2019t describe all age groups of the four mentioned as there\u2019s no mention of teenagers.\n2. B.

Choices: \nA: river B: stream C: pond D: sea E: freshwater fountain\nRationale: To determine which of the choices listed as an option is not considered a major source of fresh water in the U. S., we first need to clarify each of the alternatives.\nBy definition, \"sea\" is a large body of salt water, so it is excluded from the answer options.\nAdditionally, \"pond\" has a less official definition, so we should look into each of the other defined alternatives.\n\nThe official definition of \"freshwater\" is \"not saltwater\", so \"freshwater fountain\" would not be considered as a major source of clean freshwater in the U. S.\nThe official definition of a \"stream\" is \"a small river\", so a freshwater stream should be considered a major source.\nThe definition of a \"pond\" is \"a small body of water that collects in a low-lying area\", so it's not a major source because the size limits it.\nThe definition of the \"river\" is an \"extremely long natural watercourse\", so if the \"river\" is not long enough or if the watercourse is not natural, then the river is not a major source of clean waters.\n\nNow that we know that \"freshwater foun ttain\" is not a source of clean water in U S., the remaining choice is \"pond\".\n\n### Answer\n\nThe correct answer is \"pond\", as not all rivers meet the definition and only \"river\" is a major source.", "answer": " 66"}

How the problem is written as 'days' instead of 'hours' suggests that the 10 'days' that each employee gets are 8 hours each, so a total of 80 hours.\n\n### Deducing:The 10 days of leave are given in the question, along with the statement that each day is 8 hours, so we know that there are a total of 8o hours of leave in a year.\n    \n### Direction:Now, we have to figure out how many hours Mark uses from each type of leave in a year, without explicitly stating the number of hours.\n \n### Deduction:'If Mark uses half his allotted sick time and vacation days each year, how many hours of leave does he have left?'\nTherefore, we have a 2 way relationship: 'how many hours does he have left?' and 'how many days did he use out of his allotted leave?'\n\n### Direction 2: Mark will use half his sick days each year, as stated in the problem, so we can say that 'Mark will use half his sick time'.\n\n### Deduktion 3:'Using half his allotted sick times per year tells us that he doesn't use all 10 sick days each year, but uses an equivalent amount of days in total so that it would end up being half the total number of sick days he had in a year'.\n\n### Conclusion:Using the deductions above we can conclude that he uses around half his sick time every year, but not exactly half. The key idea is that he uses so much sick time each year that it ends up being around half his sick time over a year.\n\nTo use this information to deduce how many sick days he uses, we can take 80 hours of sick days and multiply by half, we therefore arrive at 80 x 2 = 160 hours, which would be half of his sick time. In total, he uses 160 hours of sick time per year. \n\n### D", "answer": " 80"}

{"text": "Joy needs to have 15 cups of food on hand to supply the dogs for the next 6 day period. \n\n### Demolition: \nInput: It's 8890F. What is that in F? \n\nAnswer: It's minus 30 degrees Celsius, but in the text, if we look at line 69, after \"There were 4 days\", the text states \"in the second group\", if there are 4687 then we can conclude that there are 4-6 days in the second group. Therefore 4687 = [30 days - 4 days] so 30 days - 6 days = 24 days so 30 - 24 = 6 days then we multiply 6 by 4 and then divide by 4 to get 28 days. We know though that 4687 is a number above it which makes it 42, so by substituting 42 for 4687 in line 70 we can replace 69 * (42) days which becomes 69 * 1784, which becomes 52,091 days.

First, the statement indicates the total number of spots available in all parking garage levels and the number of available spots at each respective level. However, in the question we see the value of 100 spotted per level and 58 spots on the first. This tells us that not all of the spots at each level are available for parking. \n2. Also, not given is the actual capacity of parking garage structure; however there is sufficient information to fill in this detail. We know there are 58 open spots on the first floor, 2 more on the second level than the first and 5 more on the third level than the second; this indicates that there are two floors less than the total available.\n3. That being said, the total number of available full spots for parking is 80(100-58) + 32(29) + 28(57) + 41(31).\n4.

{"text": "The question asks how many bottles remain in Jose's wine cellar after he holds a party. The answer key doesn't tell us the total number of wine bottles Jose has, so we'll need to make an assumption about the total number to solve the problem. We'll assume that the total number of bottles in his cellar is 5000 to start. To solve, we'll need to keep track of a couple statistics during the party, and we'll have to know how the different types of wine are distributed after the party, how much wine is drunk during the party, and how many bottles of a particular type of wine are drunk.\nWe need to keep track of how many bottles of each type of wine are available after the party. Jose has 2,400 imported bottles and 8,000 domestic bottles of wine in his wine cellar overall. After the party, there will be 1,666 imported wines and 9,500 domestic wines. If we use fractions to help us track how many bottles are left in each of those categories, we can get the answer\n\nBottles imported after the party = bottles imported - bottles drunk at party = 2400 - 1/3*5000 = 1,667\n\nBottles domestic after the party = bottle domestic - bottles drunk from both imports and domestic bottles = 8000 - 3/2*2000 - 8000/6 = 9,510\n\nAs you can see, if the total number of bottle are 5000, the number of bottles available after the party are 1,669 imported wines and 7,708 domestic wines.

The only way we can arrive at this is by using the following formula: \n \n(Total Price for Apples Sold)/Total Apples Harvested = The Price an Apple is Sold at\n\nBecause the total price for the apples sold would be the $40, we plug that into our formula: \n\n40 = (Price for a Sweet Apple)/50\n\nWe can simplify this to: \n\n4/5 * 50 = 40\n\nThis helps us find the price for a sweet apple which is $4. \n\nWe know also that the total number of apples harvested is 50, as 75% of 50 is 37.5, and the rest is 12.5. \n\nTherefore, the value for the Price for a Sour Apple using the formula in (23) would be: \n\n4 * 12.5 = 50\n\nThe total amount of sweet apples can be found by multiplying $4 * 37.5 = 150.\n\nHence, there were a total of 150 apples; 12.5 of which were sour.\n```", "answer": " 100"}

For example, if the instructions ask you to name the ten most popular football (or other sports) teams in India, you can assume that the instructions mean the top ten teams in the country. Even though there may be multiple football teams, the text still implies top or most since it is not clear how many teams actually exist.\n\n### Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the task?

How many clients don't need a meat-based diet?\n\nOutput: C: five\n\nDemonstantion:\n\nThe first step to solving this problem is grouping the clients. Seven clients are vegetarian. So we can mark a V for vegetarian. Next we find the clients that need a plant-based or vegetarian diet. Since seven clients are vegetarian, three are plant-based. Therefore we can mark a P for plant-based. We next find the clients that need ketogenic. There are eight such clients, so we mark an E for ketogenic. Finally we count remaining clients. There are fifteen. Three are not vegetarian or plant-based, so we mark a # for non-plant-based. Finally, there are four remaining clients. So we mark an *. (Note: this solution requires that the clients be identified as the diet they require, as opposed to the diet they demand.)\n\nFive of the clients eat a vegetarian, plant-based diet, ketogenic diet.

An ad blocker is software that blocks ads on a website that you visit.\n3. In the process of eliminating each of the answers, look for the most general and simplest answer choices. \n4. Starting with answer A, \"internet,\" the question specifically states that the ad blocker is found on websites. As such, it would not be found on the internet.\n5. Next, consider answer B, \"web sites.\" While this does seem like the obvious answer at first, think about the definition of an ad block. It is a software program. It doesn't have to reside on a single website. In fact, it can reside on any computer system. This eliminates answer B. \n6. Answer C, \"apps,\" is somewhat ambiguous. The question states that the ad blockers reside on programs programs. The fact that the ad blocker resides on a program eliminates all of the answers except answer D. As such, answer D, \"computer system,\" is correct.\n7. Finally left is answer E, \"program programs.\" The question states that the programs programs are where the ad blockers resides.

{"text": "The correct answer is D: 3.5 hours.  This is because Matthew made his famous caramel apple coffee cake once, instead of 3; it took him 2 hours and half instead of 2 hours to prep the ingredients; and it took him twice as long to bake (2 * 1.5 = 3 hours)\n### Explain:\n#### (D) 3.5 Hours:\nThe time spent on making caramel apple coffee in a day is not divided into equal segments. Since, after considering the baking time in equal segments, the total time spent is 2 hours. The total length of the day is also not equal because it is not equal to 24 hours. Therefore, the baker takes that much time to bake his cakes. The baked cakes require decoration but in equal segments of 1 hour, the baker bakes cakes in 1/4 of his day. The cake is baked within 3 hours. The second 1/4 of the day is over when the second baking is complete. This is when the time spent in baking is 3 hours. To sum up, it took 3 hours to bake the first cake and 3 hours to bak teh second cake. In total, the caramel apple coffee took 6 hours to do so. The rest of the day was spent in decorating of cakes; which took 1/4 of a day. So the total time spent on decorating is 1/2 day, which i.e 6 hours. The total time taken to do caramel apple coffee was 3 hours and the total time spent in decorating is 6 hours. The average spent time on decorating is 3/6. The total amount of time used to do caramel coffee apple is 9 hours.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe given times are not allotted in equal time; rather, the time has been divided in half. The time taken to decorate is 1/2 which is not equal to 1.5 (the time taken to bake). The time taken to decorating is greater than the time taken to bake. The time it took to make the caramel apple cake was only 3/4 because it took two days to do that. The first day was taken for making a", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "The bicycle has 96 spokes in total.\n### Justification:\n1. The question starts by giving us the information that the bicycle has 40 spokes on the back and 20 in the front. These numbers are stated together, which indicates that they each should relate to a specific wheel.\n2. From there, we have to infer the following: The bicycle has 80 spokes total on the wheels.\n3. First, think about what 40 + 20 would be. It's equal to 60. This means that to find the number of spokes the bike has, we need to subtract 40 + 60 from 20 + 40.\n4. The next step is to find the difference between the two pairs of numbers. We take the pairs (40 + 6)/2 and (20 + 20)/2 and subtract them 20 from each term in the pair to form 20. Since 20 is a common denominator to both terms, we can simplify 20 in each of the 4 terms in the pairs and get:\n\n20 - (6/2) + (20/2) \u2248 14.5\n\n5.

{"text": "Answer: A = 200 meters\n\n### Rationales:\nThe problem asks us to find the distance Javier throws the javelin the first time. The only hint we are given is that \"He threw the javelin 1050 times\". This could be referring to \"miles\", in which case he would likely throw the javelin 200 times in that setting. We know this is not the case, though, if we realize that his throw is measured in meters rather than miles.\n\nThe question follows a very basic sequence. The first throw, Javier throws twice the far he does on the second. The second throw, Javier actually throws the javelin twice the far he does the first time, but only halfway the far as he does on his third throw. We know he throws it 1050 meter times, so we just simply have to add.\nThe sum of these throws would be 1 + 2 + 2.5 = 5.5 meters long. Because a meter is 100 centimeters long, Javier threw the javelin for a total length of 550 centimeters. As 1050 is 10/2 of 550, 1050/6 = 175.\n \nWe then know that Javier threw the javalin 105 cm x 175 = 1810 cm times.  One javelin is 254 cm long. As his first throw would be half of his second throw, it would be 147 cm, and then we have to subtract the 254 cm of the javelin to find how far he threw it.\nWe end up with an answer of  147 - (147+254) = 200 cm or a little under 2m. \n\n## More Challenging\n[Link](/pages/resources/interviewtest)", "answer": " 300"}

There are only 5 quarters: 2 state quarters, 2 dimes, and 1 nickel, so if any of them were state quarters, it would have to be 3 out of the 5 quarters and the only state quarter is New Jersey not Pennsylvania, the answer is no Pennsylvania state quarters\n\nResponse: The correct answer is incorrect (The answer should be no state quarters.)\n\n### Instructions:Complete the following sentence.

{"text": "Tony has a total of 7 feet of ropes. We can calculate the sum of all lengths of ropes added together. \n\nWe subtract 1.2 foot for the knot from every rope, the 8-foot robe is 7.8 foot length left, the 20-foot is 18.2 feet, 2 feet times 3 is 6 feet, and the 7-foot robe is left as 13.2 feet. \nAt the end, the sum of all lengths is 7+7.8+18.2+6+13.2\nThe total length becomes 49 foot long.\n\n### Explain your answer in full.\n\nThis question requires a specific process in how we add up lengths and figure out total feet. We begin with a first step of putting the sum of feet in each rope. Next, we take off 1.2 foot from every rope because of every knot. We then combine the feet and start adding them up again. We repeat these steps until there are no more feet to take off. In the end, we have the answer, four feet left over.

{"text": "The house is 23 ft by 10 ft and the porch is 6ft by 4.5ft. The whole roof is made up of the total of the two floors. So the area of the whole roof is \n23ft*10ft+6ft*4.5ft=52ft squared. And the same principle applies to the porch.The porch is 6 ft*4.5 ft, so the area of the porch is 27sqft. Now if you have the area of the house, area of the porch, and area of the whole roof, you can find the area of the shingle needed to cover all of it, using the formula: area of the shingles=total area of roof * coverage ratio. The coverage ratio is the ratio of the total area of the shingling to the total area of the roof. So we can calculate the coverage of the shingles. Then we simply multiple the coverage by the area of the roof.\n\nInput: To which of the following would I be most inclined to say, \"I'm not interested\"? Choices:  A. A job B. A sale C.

And this does not make sense. If a person does not wish to share a meal, it is more likely to be a snacks date (i.e., sharing food).\nConversely, a \"job\", \"sale,\" or \"conversation\" would normally be related to work or hobbies.

{"text": "The answer is six in ten and five in three because there was an even amount of men and women, and each man did the two less that each woman did.\n\n### Why:Because each man and each one of the three women did two less than the other did. Each man bought twenty less than each woman so they can all add up to one ten. When all of them added together it would be a total of ten for each of them, but you have to add thirty for each man and three for each woman and a total of sixty five after that. You would end up with the same total for each person, but one has more apples than the rest.\n\n### Rationale: The most efficient way to do this problem would be first to separate out the women and the men. The women bought thirty apples and the men bought thirty less, for a total of sixty apples. To solve it, take the sum of the men's first thirty apples and subtract that from 35 (the women's sum). This equation can be expressed with X minus 30, where X is 35 because each woman and each man bought 60, so all you have to do is subtract 60 from the first number, taking away the second zero and giving you X. To simplify it even further: thirty subtract thirty equals nothing. It worked that way in the sum; it worked that way in the subtraction, and subtracting thirty leaves you with nothing, which leaves the men with thirty and the women with nothing (or at least, minus thirty). \n\n### Input 2: There are four women and three men in a group.  If four women and three men shake hands, how many people shake hands?\n\n### Rationales: The most straightforward way to solve this problem is to multiply the number of women and the number of men, then add one for the number of handshakes. So: 4 * 3 + 1 = 12.\n\n\n### Input :If a bookstore gives a five percent discount off of all purchases and a ten percent discount off of purchases that cost more than a hundred dollars, what is the discount on a book costing $80.93?\n\n### Answer : The discount is 25%.\n\n### Demostration :  To get to the answer,", "answer": " 210"}

From this information, we can determine the following:\n\nThere were 240 people at a combined 80 people x 3 = 240.\n\nRyan's and Taylor's combined birthday party had 80 people.\n\nRyan had a party with 240 people.\n\nThe party Ryan had was 4 times as big as the combined birthday party.\n\nRyan was able to find parties as large as 4 times more people and they were all just as many people. It doesn't make sense for her party to be 32 times bigger compared to other parties. So 32 times bigger cannot be the answer, we can be certain that the answer is not choice D.\n\nRyan and Taylor both had parties but the question does not state that the people were invited to both parties. Since the combined numbers of all parties is 240, then Ryan and Taylor can not have been invited to all the parties. Therefore, the combined invitation list cannot be the chosen answer.\n\nBecause the combined birthday party had to be 4 times bigger in order to have 240 people in total, that means that the birthday party choice from Ryan must also be 4 times larger, and therefore cannot be a 32 times larger. There are only three other possible combinations left.\n\n1) Ryan 240, Taylor 60\n1) Ryan 12, Taylor 3\n1) Ryan 80, Taylor 5\n\nNotice that with the last choice, Ryan's party had twice as many people when compared to Taylor's birthday part. If Ryan's birthday party is 4 times as big, then it must be twice as many people again, but we have already used up the 240 people that were supposed to be invited to the combined parties. If we do the math again, we know that if Ryan has a birthday party with two times as many people than her combined birthday party, that means that Ryan had an 80 person party.

{"text": "A: 50\n\n### Demolition:\nIt's not enough to simply give the correct answer though.  You need to show your steps and demonstrate the logic of the problem in a way that a human can relate to and understand, but not simply memorize and mimic.\n### Rationales:\n1. First, clarify the question, such as breaking it up into units to be solved. We are given 110 annt in total, and asked to focus on the workers. \n2. We begin with understanding the initial condition, which is knowing how many worker ants there are in total compared to non-workers (female/male). In this case, we know the total number of worker ants is 110 and total number of non-workers (male) is 22. \n3. From the given information, we know that half of the annts are worker ants - 110 divided by 2 since there are 2 types of ants.\n4. We know that 20% of the worker ants will be male, or 110 x 0.2 (since it's a compound percentage and we know that 20 is 20%).\n5. We know that there are 22 male ants.\n6. We understand that there are 110 worker ants. We also know that there are 192 worker ants in total. \n7. We know that 15 percent of the worker annts will be female. This 15% can be found by subtracting 192 and 110. This leaves 72 to go. \n8. We know that there will be 20% of those 72 that are male ants. That will give us 14 males. Thus, we know that of the 72 new female worker ants, 15% will be female in total. \n9. This means, to get the amount of female worker ants, we multiply the amount of the total number, which is 110, by the percentage of female worker ants. \n1. 192 x.15 = 29 \n2. We subtract 110, our known amount of workers to keep up with what is new.", "answer": " 44"}

Also, Ted comes over on the 6th day and eats 16 cookies and Frank eats one, so then they are left with 8 cookies. The next day when Ted comes over, he ate one and Frank ate one so that leaves them with 8 cookies.\n4. When Ted leaves, there are still two trays left for Frank to bake 21 cookies in total.\n\nNow, Frank bakes two trayed cookies each day for five days. If Frank ate one cookie every day to ensure that they tasted good, how many are left in the sixth day?\n\n### Answer:11\n\n### Instructions:\n* Answer the following multiplication math problem.\n\n### Demo:\n* Input: Multiply the following: 4 x 5 - 14\n* Response\n\n### Demo Answer: This means 4 x 5 =10 and 5-14 = -14. 4 x 5- 14 will be (4x5)-14.\n\n### Question: The difference of two numbers is 7 and their sum is 19. What are the numbers?\n\n### Demo Response:\nThis means that the first number needs to increase by 7 to get the difference between the two numbers. Also, you can think of the two numbers as variables. Then, using the distributive property we can subtract 19 over the second number.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question asks us to find the difference between the two given numbers. However, because the sum of each number to the other is known, we can determine the difference between the two. The two methods provide different answers. The distributive method is known as the formula for the difference of two numbers. The first way using the difference between the two times the second number - 19.\n\n### Input\n\n* Question: What is 1 plus square root of 3?\n\n### Demos\n* How did I know I needed to find the square root of 3, and then the answer to that was just the square root", "answer": " 134"}

{"text": "I am in my 40s and have been at this for 20 years. I've learned a lot about this subject over the years and have gotten good at it. There are many different ways to do this calculation, and I can help you write a good solution.\n\nI'd start by putting each of the equations into a different section. This way you can go through each step of the process.\n\nThis is what I'd do:\n\n1. Figure out what each variable means\n2. Estimate how much time each process would take\n3. Add it all up to the total time it would take\n\nExample: You have 20 minutes and you need to get from New York to California. You could take 20 minutes to get from Manhattan to NYC and then 2 hours to travel from Chicago to LA.\n\n### Next we need to figure out what each variable means:\nHow long does it take to fill the pool? This is the amount of time it takes to fill the pool.\nHow much water comes out of the leak at a time?\nHow fast does water come out of the leak?\nHow many minutes does it take for a gallon of water to come out?\n\nThe amount of time it takes for a gallon of liquid to come out is 1.7 seconds. The amount of time it takes one gallon of liquid to fill the pool is 14400 (24 X 60) seconds.\n\n### Now the estimate how long it will take to get to each destination:\nFill the pool: 1.7 seconds / 1.7 seconds = 1 hour\nLeak water: 1/1/2 1440 1440 Seconds\n\n### It will take a total of three minutes to fill the pool.  (1 hour+ 1440 seconds)\n\n### Next I would add it all up and see if it's correct: I'm on the verge of spending 6 hours on this task. I think you might want your writing to be shorter or more concise, depending on how many tasks you're trying to do at once with this program.

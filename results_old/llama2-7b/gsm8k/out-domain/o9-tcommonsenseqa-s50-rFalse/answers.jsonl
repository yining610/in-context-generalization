{"text": "Input:Conner has a buggy that will travel down the desert at an average speed of 60 mi/hr.  When the buggy is on downhill sloping surfaces it has a speed that is 12 mi/hr greater than the speed of the buggy.  When riding on uphill surfaces the buggy has a speed that is minus 18 mi/hr. \n\nThe distance a buggy travels is proportional to the rate of speed.  So if the buggy travels 1/3 of the time on flat surfaces, the buggy will travel 1/3 of its speed in flat surfaces.  When the bugg travels 1/s of the time on upland surfaces, the buggy wil travel 1/s of its speed in upland surfaces, and for the remaining 1/3 the buggy will travel on downhill slop surfaces.  (These values of time need not exactly equal 1 but it is close if it is not too close so that the numbers are integers.\n\nThe distance traveled on flat surfaces is 1/3 of a distance that will be found by multiplying the speed of the bugg on flat surfaces by 1/3.  The distance traveled on uphill sloped surfaces is 1/s of a distance that will b found by multiplying the buggy s speed on uphill surfaces by 1/s.  The distance trailer of the buggy on downhill slop surfaes is 1/3 times a distance that will 1/ be found by multiplying 1/3 of bugg speed by 1/3 of ditch slope surface's. \n\nDistance = rate of speed * the time it takes to travel.  So the rate is the rate of speed. The distance traveled is the product we  just calculated. \n\nSo the total distance that a buggy travels downhill is 1/3 the distance that the buggy travels on flat surfaces.  The buggy does not necessarily travel at a flat surface's rate all of the time.  When it is on uphill surfaces, the buggy travels at a pace which is the buggy uphill speed times the value 1/s.\n\nIf in a 12 hour day the buggy travels the distances that correspond", "answer": " 58"}

There are 52 weeks in a year and 40 apples in each bag. After 1200/40, that means that you get 3 of Gerald = 3 * 40 = 120. Thus, I will multiply that to 1200 and I get 120,000 apples.

You will then need to write a program that solves the problem.  The assignment instructions will give guidance throughout the assignment.\n\n### Rubi\n\nThe following describes a Rubi expression.\n\n### Cumulative\n\nIn an expression, the results, expressed as a sequence, are the successive results of a function that depends on a value.\n\nA Rubi definition is a declaration that includes an expression.   The expression may have the form:\n\n\tX + 1 (cumulative)\n\t\nwhere X is the parameter of the algorithm and 1 gives the results an arithmetic increase of one.  There is little distinction between cumulative and non-cumulative in Rubi.\n\n### Non-Cumulative\n\nIn math expressions, the results may be calculated independently (non-cumulatively) of each other.  For example, the results of addition are all independent of each other and, hence, cumulative is not needed. \n\n### Function Expressions\n\nIn Rubi, the results are the output of an expression such as Y = 5X - 3, in which X and Y are parameters and 5X and -3 are constant values.  Rubi expression: Y = 2X - 5, the value 5 can be expressed as a constant.\n\n### Combined\n\nTo make it simple, if the cumulative part and non-cumulate part of a function can be combined, the result will be the cumulative part of the combined function.\n\n### Functions\n\nThere are two primary forms of expressions in mathematics.\n\nWhen two or more expressions, such as two expressions, function as a single expression and there is a sequence of the inputs, such as X and Y.  Then this expression is called as a function.  \n\nA function is defined as a mathematical statement or relationship.  It describes how input parameters are transformed into output.  To be more precise, a function defines how some real-valued input (or a group of inputs) gives another real-valued output.\n\nIn short, a function is a mapping from input to output.", "answer": " 12"}

They decided to go to the woods to see if they saw any interesting animals. They were worried because it might take them more long and tiring to reach to the woods. They could go on the roads, but the roads would lead to the same place as they would if they took the woods. However, they are worried at the woods because it is a difficult forest. It had many thorns and it was hot. It is a 2 hour hike to the woods (or it could be just a road if they went on it). They need a way of getting to the woods faster and easier, so they decided to build a bridge.\n\n### Solution Example\nJeremy (age 15) would need 3 hours to walk to the woods. He could walk (tiring and long). He could walk faster because the roads would have led him there just as fast. But walking faster would cause him to be worn out easily because he would have to walk faster. \n\n### Write your scenario here:\n(4-6", "answer": " 34"}

No example is stated, and the answer can be the correct one or not. The instruction does not mention an answer, though I thought of giving C: A second loan or B: Ask for an additional month to pay the whole repair. I would use \"A\" as an option.\n\n### Input\n\nA: A second loan\nB: Ask for an additional time to pay the whole repair\nC: Do not repair\nD: Hire someone to repair\nE: Buy a new car\nF: Sell your car\n\n### Expectations response:\n1)C\n\n[1] I assume to be an answer, and since the instruction gives no answer, this question makes no sense.\n\n\n### Analysis response:\n1)A: A Second Loan\n\nThe problem asks the user to find his option among 6 possibilities to fix his car. These could include going for repairs, obtaining a loan, selling it, and so on. The instruction is to be read literally (repair the car). I think C (Do not repair) would be the choice that solves the problem.\n\n\n2)B: Ask for an Additional Time\n\nThe problem asks \"How could you fix the car while keeping the cost reasonable\", and I replied with getting a loan for some extra time to repair it.

{"text": "Daniel spent $3359 on his video games\n\n### Input  \nInput: The managers of a computer company were trying to decide how many computers to buy. The total cost would be the square of the number of computers, $C = N^2. They had three options available. Each option reduced cost by a different percentage. The options in this situation are called choices. Choices: A: Buy 10 computers. Buy 5 more computers, and the cost of the remaining computers would be $0 B: Buy 5 computers. Buy 4 more computers, and the remaining cost of the original quantity would be $1,100 C: Buy 20 computers. Buy one more computer, and the remaining cost would be $0\n\n### Response\nWhen each option of computer company has increased the number of computers, the total cost of company will decrease as a consequence.\n\nOption A, the company is buying 10 computers, then it needed 43 more computers. That is the total number of computers and 100 was the cost of 50 computers, that is the remaining number so there is the cost of 0. It means if this company buys 50 computers, then the cost of 100 computers would be $8,250.\n\nOption B, company is buying 5 computers, then it needs 45 more computers. The total number of computers is 50. They buy more 4 computers, with the cost of 0, it means if they buy 50 computers, the cost of remaining number of computers is $0.\n\nOption c, company is buying more 10 computers but it needs 19 more computers. It means that if they buy 100 computers they need 39 more computers with the cost of 11,010. That is more than buying 100 computers, its cost is $1,109.00\n\nTherefore company is choosing the option of B, which is buying 5 more computers with the cost the $1,108.00. So the total cost will be $11,108 and the total number of computers will be 85.\n\n### Input\nGerry wants to use a phone number for his banking and phone calls, and it", "answer": " 2290"}

{"text": "In total, there are 58 chairs.\n\n### Input\nGiven a sequence of integers, return whether or not it contains a subsequence that adds up to zero, with the same number of digits. If I give you [3, 2, 4, 2] for example, you should return True, as there is definitely a subsequence that adds to zero [3, 2]!\n\n### Solution\nThe solution is in brute force:\n```java\nif(!n.isEmpty() && current >= 0) {\n    if(!n.substring(0, current).equals(Integer.toString(current).toString())) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    current++;\n}\n\nreturn n.substring(0,n.length()).length() >= current;\n```\nIf there is a subsequence that sums up to zero, it is also a subsequence that adds more zeros at the end. So it is at least as long, and you can end the sequence when you reach the second last number to save time.\n\n### Solution with a queue\nThis solution is a lot better, but I would recommend to look around and understand the solution before jumping in to get it, as it is not a linear solution.\nFirst of all, you could just make a queue for them, and then use an index and an iterator to read from it.\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    boolean containsZeroSumSubsequence(int[] nums) {\n        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();\n        for (int number : nums) {\n            if (number == 0) continue;\n            if (queue.contains(number)) {\n                return true;\n            } else {\n                queue.enqueue(number);\n            }\n        }\n        return false; // since a queue is FIFO, if the subsequence doesn't add up to zero after the last 'not zero' number, the subsequence doesn' give the wanted result\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Solution (2)\nThis solution just adds an if statement in the previous method to check if the element is already in the list. As we are using a queue, this method does not use quadratic time, as we are not searching for the element in this list.\n```java\npublic static boolean containsZeroSumSubseq(int", "answer": " 91"}

{"text": "She paid a total of $257.50\n\n### Reason: The following formulas were used to solve for the total cost:\na) Original Price = 200 * 1.25\nb) 25% off = Original Price *0.75\nc) Sales tax = Original Price * 0.10\nd) Total Cost = (Original Price * 0.75) + (Original Price * 10%) = 200(1.25) + 200(0.10) = 250 + 20 = $270\n\n### Justification: We created a new variable:  price to help organize the data. First we wrote down original price. The Original Price is written as 200. Since Donna is getting 25% off, we multiply by this amount (200 *1.25). To write the sales tax, we multiply it to the Original Price (Original Price * 2.5%).", "answer": " 165"}

It is unclear if there is any order or way to remove the notes. If Jake is removing them all at random the best estimate can be found at https://www.dice.com/c/660,50,660,411,1,5,52,33,4 by dividing by 249 as the probability of a 6 is 1/6 and the probability of a 5 is 1/6. It is possible that jake might remove all the red notes first and then remove all the blue notes under all of them, so it is a bit higher than the probability of getting 6 on a dice.\n\nTo find the other numbers the same pattern is used. Start with the 8 red notes in the first row, add one to the probability of getting an 8 for 9. Add one to the probability of another 8 for 10. Continue to add one to the probability for each row until it has been accounted for. Then calculate the probabilities for getting 5 and 6 under the red notes.

It will help them be better prepared.\n\nGrade 11, Math, Cohort 1A, Danny\n\n### Note 1: \n\nThis request was to test the capability of the classified algorithm for the NLP task. NLP refers to Named Entity Recognition (NER). This is a form of problem solving that can only be handled by a classifier. In order to test the algorithm, there is a need for a data set with an appropriate number of examples. \n\nThe first part of the task requires some input from a user and the second part returns the output of the algorithm. In order to perform the second part of the task. One needs a complete algorithm to read each response and select if it is correct or not.\n\nThis is currently unable as there is no implemented algorithm to select the right response. In fact, this is one of the reasons why this project was created. Therefore, in order to train the algorithm to select the right answer, a sample set will be given to the classifier. \n\nAs the algorithm is built using the TensorFlow Machine Learning framework, a dataset will be needed. This is due to the fact that the model in it is trained with a dataset. This will also help with the training of the model.\n\nFurther details about the dataset can be found at Dataset.\n\nFor more details about this request, please refer to Task:Grade 11 Math\n\n### Note2:\nThe second task is to make a request to the bot to answer a grade 11 math problem. This request is to test that the algorithm can understand the problem.\n\nIf the algorithm fully understood the problem. The bot should provide the right answer.\n\nThe second task is used as a demonstration. For this request, there is a lot of user interaction in order to know that the algorithm was understood correctly.\n\nThis is because, if it was not understood correctly, a further explanation is necessary to perform the task correctly. In order to avoid a lot of back and forth through comments, there is a task which has a demonstration.\n\nThis is only an additional demonstr", "answer": " 66"}

The ages in which the four children were born were 15 years ago, one years after, two years after and two years after which is 10 years in total. \n\n2. One years after their first child and one years after each subsequent child which adds up to one year for each four children.\n\n### Exemplar Response:\n\nThe age of her fourth child is 5 years. After their first child they have three more children with a gap of each child being one year apart. After birth with their second child their had a gap of six and after birth with their third child their was a gap of more than one year. After the birth of the two children, the gap was 3 and then two years after the birth of the one child the last one, there was also a gap of two years. Therefore the gap of two years adds up to 5 years and makes her final child be 5.\n\n### Feedback:\n\nIf you put any other age aside from 5 years you will be wrong as their gap was not consistent. So you will be only able to calculate the third child then the second child and finally the first child which will add up to 15 years which is not what you have to find which is the fourth child's age.", "answer": " 8"}

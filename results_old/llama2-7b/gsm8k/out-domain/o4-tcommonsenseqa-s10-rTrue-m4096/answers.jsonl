{"text": "Tobias mowed 8 lawns, and shoveled 4 driveways. He charges to shovel lawns, and mows lawns, and he mows 4 of one.\n\n**Response:** 1. Step 1 - Make note of the following:\n\n\n**Step 2 - Identify the key action:** This one is tricky, but it's the mowing 4 lawns.\n\n**Step 3 - Reflect on the possible scenarios and evaluate each option:** Mowing 4 lawws is likely the action that we want to complete here, but we also need to shovel to end up with enough money to buy our new shoes. Our choices are either mowing 4, or shoveling 4. The best way to deal with this is to calculate the possible scenarios and evaluate the ones that will give us the best possible results. \n\nSo if we start with mowing, we will need to mow 4 and then shovel. After we shovel, we will have $15 in change left, but that's after mowing. \n\nSo we need $15 for the shoveling. That means we will have $90 after shoveling, and that's if we can afford the $15, which we can, since we only mowed 4. \n\n\nSo the scenario that gives us the best possible outcome we can have is mowing 4 and shoveling 4, as this will allow us to make the maximum amount possible.\n\nThe other options we can have is moweing 4 and shoving 8 (which would yield $15 in change), and would allow us to buy the shoes only if we can afford the price of shoveling 8 (which will require some saving up from our income since we already spent $90 from it). \n\nOr we can save up and shove 4. Shoving 4 doesn't require us to spend the $90 we previously spent mowing 4. \nBut then we will have $145 after the 8, which isn't enough to buy the shoes ($95).\n\n\n**Step for 4 - Select the most appropriate option given the available options**\n\nWe want to mowe", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "The first step toward solving this problem is to determine the current weight of the cow based on the information provided in the question.  The current weight is calculated by multiplying the starting weight by 1.5, which yields a pound.  The new weight of the cow = 400 x 1.5 = 600.\nTo find out how much more the cow is worth after gaining the extra weight, we subtract the starting price per pound from the current price per pound. Starting price per pound = $3 per pound and the current price per pig is $5 per pound, so the new price per pound after gaining weight is $5 - $3 = $2 per pound. The next step is to determine the difference between the current and starting weight: the difference = 600 - 400 = 200 pounds.  So 200 pounds x $2 = $400.  Therefore, the cow was worth $400 more than its starting weight after gaining the weight.\nAnswer: A) 400 pounds", "answer": " 600"}

Choices: \t\tA: Labrador\t\tB: Pit Bull\t\tC: Great Dane  \t\tE: Bernese Mountain Dog\nRationales:\nThe given options, A: labrador, B: Pit Bull, C: Great Dane, and E: Bernese Mountain Dog, are all breeds of dogs. \n1. Our first step is to identify the type of thing the sentence is trying to get across.\n2. The sentence says \"Your dog is not well behaved\", followed by \"while in the park\". \n3. These statements allude to negative behavior. \n4. Next, we need to determine the \"place\" where this behavior is displayed. \n5. That \"place\" is the \"dog park\", where dogs typically congregate. \n6. Given this context, we know that a negative dog behavior is one displayed in the dog park.\n7. Our last task is to narrow down the negative behavior by eliminating unsuitable options. \n\na. We begin by eliminating option A: Labrador. \n\nb. We know that a dog park is a place that typically gathers multiple dog breeds, hence the option A: Labradosr, which refers to a single breed, can be eliminated.\n\nc. We now move to eliminate option C: Great Dane. \n\nd. The context is \"not well behaved\" and we know that negative dog behaviors aren't exclusive to a single breed. \n\ne. We also know Great Dane is a breed of dog, so it is possible that \"the dog\" is a Great Dane, but that doesn't necessarily mean the dog park itself is full of Great Dane.  Hence, option C: Great Dano can be eliminated. \n\nf. We now move to an eliminate option E: Bernese Mountain dog. \n\ng. Just like earlier, the context is \"not well behavior\" and a dog behavior in a dog park can be displayed by any breed of dog, not just ones with a specific breed.  Hence, option E: Bernese mountain dog can be eliminated.", "answer": " 42"}

{"text": "The increase in expenses over the past year is due to the combination of two factors: the proportional change in costs and the multiplicative change due to the inflation factor. In other words, the overall increase of her expenses over the past can be calculated by multiplying the proportional change in costs with the multiplicative change in costs.\n\n### For a Proportional Change\n\nFrom the given conditions, Jessica's rent increased by $300, which is 30% of her $1000 rent. Similarly, her food cost increased by $50, which is equivalent to 50% of its initial price. These numbers represent a proportional change in spending, with an increase of 100% over the last year.\n\n### Multiplicative Change\n\nAlong with the proportional change, there is also a multiplicative change to the overall increase. In other words, Jessica's expenses increased by three times due to the impact of the inflation factor that affected the cost of rent and food. Therefore, rather than $300+50=350 for a proportional increase of 10%, Jessica's expense increase over the last year is equal to $300+3(50)=300+150=450 for a total of $1500.\n\n### Answer\n\nJessica's expenses in the current year increased by 33,33% compared to the previous year and is $450 higher than in the previous year.\n\n## Tasks\n\n### Instructions:1.

You know that the ant can move at the rate of 15 inches a second. Your dog can outrun the ant by 72 inches. If the ant moved by the amount of inches that your dog outran the ant, how many inches did the ant move?\n\n### Demostration:There is a possible solution that you can use to find the distance. The first step is to get the required data:\n1. We are given that the ant is the size of someone's finger and that it can move at the rate in 15 inches/sec.\n2. We also know that dog can run outrun the ant by the distance of 72 inches or 6 feet, which is roughly equivalent to 60 inches.\n\n### Next step, we set up the following relationship between the data. We write it as follows:\n* x represents the distance in feet\n* x = (0.72 feet)(15 miles/second) = 10.8 meters/second\n\nUsing this formula, in first step, we get the length of movement of the ant:\n* x = (10.8 meters per second)(60 inches/meter) = 650.4\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is that the ant moves 650.\n### Feedback:\n```\nIt is important first to be clear of the task: What do we have to do and what is the problem we are solving?

{"text": "One of the key insights is that 12 pies are being made during an hour. This means that 12 pieces of pies are being sold during a single hour.\nWe also know from the question that one pie costs $4 and has 3 pieces. From this information, we can see that each pie has a value of $1. Hence, the bakery will be selling 12 pies during an hour. Each of the 12 pie sells for $1, giving us a total revenue of $12.\nIn addition, we know that every time a pie is being made, it costs the bakery 0.50 $. This means that for every hour, the bakery would require 0.50 $ to produce 12 pies, resulting in a total cost of 0.60 $.\n\nCombining the revenue and cost information, we can calculate the total profit made by the bakery:\ntotal profit = revenue - cost\n\ntotal profit = 12 x 1 - 0.6 = 11.4\n\nHence, the bakery at the end of the hour will have a profit of 11.4.\n\n### Response Type: Restaurant Example\n\n#### Instruction:\nWhich of the option does not have anything in common with an item in a restaurant menu?

We can apply linear factoring to solve for $x$. \n\nFactoring out $y$.

We know they only make $20k, so we need to make their earnings multiply by $1.8, so they end up making $35,0k.  \n\nSince we're dealing for $20,0k, we can multiply it times whatever we have multiplied by, in this case $1.8$ (the amount the employees get increased by) and we should be in the ball-park. \n\nSince we've gotten it to $35,0(1.8), it should be: 50k per employee. \n\nAnd since we have $10$ employees, we simply multiply $50$ times $10$, and get $500k.\n\nWe're left with a remainder of $1,009,000$.

{"text": "The amoeba will take 6 days to split into 16 amebiae. Lets explain this.\n\n1. Every two days in terms of 2 days, this means that each day is a second day. Amoebae reproduces every 2 days, so this means in 2 days, it can be said that the amoeba has reproduced twice, thus making a new amoeba, thus doubling the count by doubling by the time in the question.\n2. We know, therefore, that amoebae produces four new amoebae per day.\n3. Since the question states how many days it will take for the amoeba to split into 15 amoebae we will need to figure out how many times, multiplied by how many days that this will take. 15-4=11, We'll need to multiply this by how many times the amoebea produces amoebae in one day.\n4. There are 364 (leap year included) days in a year. Which means that we'll need to multiply by 15 days, which is 540.\n5. We'll need to multiple 5 by 5 to make 25.

For example, if the problem asks how many items \"3 boxes\" contain, first take note of the fact that \"3\" refers to three items, and so you create a measurable unit of 3 items = one box. From here you can translate the problem into a set of measurements using this system and use that to generate a pictorial representation of the problem.\n\n\n### Hints\n\n1. A hint I\u2019d give you is to pay attention to the key action from this question.  A key action is any specific action that the person is doing within the context of the question asked.  For example in this case, the key action is \"the person plans on to stop their marriage.\"  We can identify the key action by asking, \"What specific thing is the person going to do in this problem, or do now? Why?\"  Once we identify the key action we can then evaluate what other potential consequences could be related to the specific action in the question. For example, in this case we can ask, \"Will there be any effect on their emotions?\" \n\n\n### Answer\n\nThe person's is probably going to stop their marriage since that is the action in the question.  This is a consequence of them stopping their marriage.  To be more specific, the person plans on to stop be married is one consequence of stopping their marriage and that leads to sad", "answer": " 5"}

Andy wasn't satisfied by this weight and so he went to exercise during these next 3 months: each month he lost 1/8 of the weight he gained during a full year; \n4. So the solution to the question is: Andy weighs a little less than 183 pounds now, since losing 1/8 of 36 in 3 months is equivalent to losing 3% of the initial weight.\n### The solution given:\nLet's see if your answer is correct:\n(44/100) of 36 is 14, which is about 14 pounds;\n(91/100) or 1/8 of your 36 is 4,25, which is about 4.25 pounds, so your solution is 14+4.25=18.25, which is slightly higher than 183.\n### Exercise:\nNow that you have solved the task, answer the question below.\n1.

However, coffee drinkers have varying drinking preferences, such as the size of cups, number of cups per day, type of coffee, etc. So one could argue that the drink needs more than 3 litres. Thus, option B: coffee is ineligible.\n\nD: Beer requires more than 3 Litres to be drunk in a regular binge. Therefore, one needs more than 3 Liters of beer to be drunk for a binge. This eliminates option D: beer.\n\nThis leaves us with E: water the only option that meets the requirement of the question, which is a liquid with a minimum of 3 Liters required to be used to be drunk.\n\nDetailed Demonstration of Relevant Calculations:\nLet us consider what the minimum needed amount of fluid for a person to be drunk will be.\nFor 1 Liter to be drunk, a cup of water for example, it is required that 7 liters of such water to be consumed for 1 liter to remain in the body after the process of drinking and excretion.\nNow, what does a person need, if he or she were to have enough water", "answer": " 10"}

A math problem\n\n### Input\n\n30% of a number equals 8. Find the number.\n\n### Rationales:\n\nFirst, we identify the variables we have: 30% of a certain number is 8. So, 30% would be the dividend (the part we're dividing), and 8 would be the divisor (the amount we're dividing by). Dividing 30% (the dividend) by 8 (the divisor) gives us the quotient, which is equal to what we want to find: x, or the number. X is simply the dividend times 100 percent (to get percentages back to whole numbers). So, the number is 30%. 30% of 500 would be 500/30 x 100%, which is 16.667.\n### 13.

However, does it provide us with the correct answer?\nUsing basic arithmetic, we have: (1 + 2) x Price = What we want to know.\nSubstituting our variables:\n(1) + 2 x Price = Want to know\n1 + 2 x Price + Price = Want to Know\n(3) x Price = Want To Know\n3 x Price = WantToKnow\nTaking the root of both sides we have: 3/Price = WantToKNow\nWantToKNow divided by 3 is the cost. \n3/Price is the Price plus one. Thus,  Price + 1 = WantToKOnow, or: Price = WantTo Known - 1\nIf we substitute this for Price in our WantToKnow equation, WantToKNoW becomes:\n3/[ (WantTo KNoW - 1) ] = want to know\n3 / [ (Want To Know - 1) ] is the inverse of our equation.

{"text": "There are 2 dogs, 120 cats, and 10 dogs in all. To answer the question, determine what percent of family owns one dog. First, find how many total families own dogs. Dogs owned by 1/15th of families and cats owned by 1/20th of families. Thus, add up these two percentages: 1/(15 * 50) + 1/(20 * 50) = 1/15 + 1/20 = 3/50 = 6/100 = 1/16. One dog is 16/50 of families, so the number of dogs is 1 * x = 1 * (16/50) = (15/50) * (1/x). Solve x = 1. Thus, families own 2 dogs. For the total number of cats, subtract 8 times total dogs owned by families from 10 times total dogs owned by total families. x+x - 8x - 10x = 2(15/50)+1(15/5) - 8(2/50)+10(2/50) = 21/50 - 11/50 + 16 + 100 = 250/50 - 20/50 = 1 50/50 = (15+15)/50 = 30/50.\n\n### Input : There is a bus with 15 people and 18 seats.

{"text": "Profit: Answer is (25-(25x2+1x3)x6)=360-\n\n### Rationale:\nFor this problem we have to find the profit we would make. We can do this by using the equation: Profit = Revenue - Costs.\nFirst, we need to understand what a seller is. A seller refers to a person who sells their services or products on the market. In this case a seller is a businessman who sells charm bracelets on the market.\nSo now that we understand what a seller does, we can begin to break the question down into understandable pieces.\nSo the question will be:\n\n```\nYou spend $1 on the  string for each bracelets and $3 on bead for each bracelets\nYou sell the bracelets $6 each. If seller sells  25 bracelets    \n```\n\nTo make a profit, the following must be true:\n\n```\nProfit must equal   the Selling price -   Cost\n```\nWhich can be written out as:\n\\[Profit =  (Selling price) - (cost)\\]\n\nSo now we are able to figure out how much profit seller makes\n\nSince the selling price is   \\[ (25)(6)  =  \\$150]\\]\nThe cost is    \\[ (25)\\( 1 + 3)\\(3)= \\$15\\].\n\nSo the profit after all the bracelets are sold would be:\n\n``` 0  =  \\$165 - \\$15= \\$150 \n```\n### Input: What type of person can do the activities below?

In this case, the word practicing.\nNow let's compare the 16 tables to all of the students.\nIf each table has 8 people, then they are equally split between the 4 times.\nIf each table only has 4 people, they would all have a time that is half of the time they would get if the table has 8 seats.\nNext, we see that the word the is not related to the rest of the sentence. So that can be eliminated.\n\nSince most of the sentences are talking about 8, we get 4 times 8, which is equal to 32.

These are all correct results.\n\nSimilarly, between 7 and 13 is added and between 2 and zero is subtracted, so we get either 9 or 11. These are both correct answers.\n\nThis process continues until all 24 zoo species are accounted for and the sum of the numbers is known.\n\nIn this example, we will consider each zoo species to be a number between 0 and 12, so x = 24.\nNow that we know that the total number of animals is 24, we can also assume that every zoo has one parrot, which is why we subtract 1 from the parrot count.\n\nNow, our problem becomes, the number of parrotri + snaker + monkey = 2 + x + y \n\nNow, we need to calculate x.\nIt can be done using 2 variables.\nSince each zoo only has one monkey and one parrot, let's put 1 in each of these places.\nx = x - 2\nSimplified,\n\nx = x - (1 -1)\n\nx = 2x - 1\n\nx = x  - 1\n\nThere", "answer": " 35"}

The charity asks the accountant to work 7 days per week and increase their pay by $25. This leaves the accountant $25 a week to cover additional costs that the charity incurs. The accountant already currently works 56 hours each week, which equates to 8 hours a day, and they want to maintain their lifestyle while working fewer hours and thus have to increase the 8 hours they already work by a total of 16 hours. \n\nStep 2: Identify the essential values in the problem:  We know that the essential variable in the scenario is the increase of hours that the accountant has to work in order to maintain her lifestyle since all other variables are already known.\n\nStep 3: List the essential values: We know that in order to increase the number of hours the accountant currently spends on work in order to maintain their lifestyles, then she has to start working 16", "answer": " 46"}

Javier wants to raise $98. \n\nStep 2: Extract the parameters that we need to calculate: We first find the value in $2.40 we need to raise via the goal of $96, which leaves us with $32 (96-64).\nStep 3: Assess our data: 1. Javier buys each dozen of donuts for $24. 2. $1 is the price that each dozen of donuts sell for.  3. 3 dozen of donuts are needed to reach an individual goal of $96 ($36 per dozen of donuts). \n\n\n#### Step 2: Perform mathematical operations to arrive at an answer.\nStep 2.1: Calculate difference between $32 and $24: $32 is what Javier buys the dozen of donuts for and $24 is the price Javier sells the dozen of donuts (3 for $1). Therefore, $32 - $24 = $8.\nStep 202: Multiply $8 by 3 to achieve the total number of dozen of donuts that Javier purchased: $8*3 = $24. \nStep 2: Sum $8 and $24: To arrive at the total quantity of dozen donuts, we proceed by adding the two totals: $24 + $24 = $48 (48 dozen of donuts).\n\n\n\n#### Step3: Interpret data and conclude\nStep 3: Find out total of 48 dozen of donut sold by Javier: Javier is sells 48 dozen of dozens, hence he is selling a total of 48 dozens of donuts ($1*48= 48).

This can be done by calculating the number of flowers that would bloom each unicorn\u2019\n\nTo do this, we need to calculate the number of meters traveled by each unicorn during their trip, which we know will be 9 kilometers. Divide this by the speed at which they move 3 meters per step, leading to the answer of 3\u00d79 = 27 meters for each unicorn.\nTo calculate the number of flowers as a result of each unicorn\u2019 step, we must first calculate the number of steps each unicorn takes, which is multiplied by 4 to account for each unicorn\u2019 bloom per step.\nDoing this calculation leads to 3\u00d727 = 81 for each unicorn; with 6 unicorns, the answer is 81\u00d76 = 486 flowers.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 486 flowers\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: What happened when human hair is used in this activity?

{"text": "28\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question starts by describing the behavior of the monster, which then goes on to provide information about the ships and the people each ship carried over the hundred year interval.\nLet's break the question into two parts, the behavior of the monsters, and the changing ratio of people on the ship to the number of people the monster consumes.\n\nWe start by describing the behavior of our monster:\n\nThe monster rises to consume a ship every 100 years\n\nIt has consumed 827 people over the course of 300 years.\n\nWe can observe the following logical implications from these statements:\n\n1. The monster is alive for 100 years then dead for 200 years.\n2. Each person the monster consumes is alive for only 10 years and dead for 90 years.\n\nFollowing this line of logic, we can make a number of inferences and logical deductions, but the most relevant here is the following: The monster is alive and does not return for roughly 200 years after each one it consumes.\nIn the first century it sated their hunger on an average of 54 passengers on a ship or 28 people in total.\nIn the century after it sated their hungry on 60 passengers or 120 people.\nThe monster hasn't emerged from the water yet and the ships are becoming larger as the number of passengers on each ship double.\n\nWith this behavioral information in mind we can analyze the monster's consumption over the past 8 centuries in the following way.\n\nFor every 800 years, it consumes an average of 285 passengers, or roughly 30 ships per 100 years.\nThis also means that it is going to consume a ship roughly 700 years after last consuming a ship, or 1000 years from now.\nThe largest ship consumed, however, had 640 passengers on it, thus 320 people survived, not to mention those who were alive before that ship was consuming passengers from the shore. The monster is most likely alive and ready to feast by the time we reach the year 2900.\n\nIn this analysis, we can dedu", "answer": " 121"}
{"text": "4.5 hours\n\n### Instructions:\nStep 1: Identify what a person does: 1.A person reads 8 pages in 20 minutes, which, in this case, indicates that the person can read 8 pages per 20 minutes.\n\nStep 2: Identify the amount the action will take for the purpose of calculating: 1. The first step to calculate this is to calculate the amount of time that it would take to finish 120 pages, based on the time it takes to finish the 8 pages. 2. We multiply 8 pages by 120 pages to get the total number of pages read, which gives 960 pages. 3. We then divide the number of pages read by the number of minutes taken per page to get the total time taken to read the remaining pages. 4. This gives us 960 pages / 20 minutes per page = 48 pages per minute.\n\nStep 3: Perform calculations: 1. The next step is to apply the information from the previous step to calculate the total time it would take to read 12 pages. 2. To calculate this, we multiply 12 pages by 48 pages to get 576 pages. 3. Then, to find the total time, we divide the number of pages by the number of minutes per page to get 575 pages / 20. minutes per page = 28.75 minutes per page. The final time it would take to finish reading the pages is given as 576 pages / 28.7 minutes per page = 19.9125 minutes per page / 60 minutes = 39.8646 minutes per page. This can then be rounded to 40 pages per hour, which means the total time it would require to complete reading the remaining pages is 40 hours.\n\n### Input 1: 1 inch is what number of centimeters?\n\n### Instructor feedback:\nThe given number is incorrect.

So, 20% of the volume of the bucket is 2Lx0.20 =0.4L\n**Step 3:** Add 0.2L of water to the volume in the bucket. Now we can figure out the volume of salt that is required. So, 2L (the bucket) + 0.2L (evaporated water) = 2.2L \n**Step 4:** If we already know that 2L of water is made up of 20% salt and the salt is the only remaining substance, then all the salt, 0.2L is required to have 20% salt.\nStep 5: Determine the quantity of salt to be consumed\n**Step 6:** Substituting quantity in L with mass in g, we're equating 2.2L with 0.4L+0.2L\nIn this formula, we can cancel out the 0.4L and only find out the 0.2L, which is found to be 0.231 g.

{"text": "He bought 2 ounces of sode\n\n### Rationale:\nThe total value of the items Peter bought is $0.50. He spent twice as much money as he spent, so he had a balance of $0 left in the bank. This means that the cashier subtracted an amount that is equal to the difference between the two amounts ($.50 = $2 - $1.50). Hence, Peter bought 2 ounices of soda.\n\n### Input\nHow many inches tall are there in 2 miles? \n\n### Demostration\n2 miles are 1760 yards. This can be represented as 2 miles = 1760 yds. Each mile has 63,360 inches. This can be represented by the formula 1 mile = 63,328 inches. In this formula substitute 1 miles in place of 63,380, and substitute the 1760 from the earlier part of this equation. We get 1760 = 63,008 inches. Hence, 2 miles is equivalent to 3720 inches. Thus, we can find that there are 3720 yards in 2 miles, which can be converted to inches to 34,560 inches in 2 miles, as there are 12 inches in a yard. We can combine these two equations to find that there are 5288 inches in 2 miles. This means that 1 mile has 5288 units of length, of which one must subtract one which leaves only 5287 units of length in a mile.\n\n### Rational:\nFor each of the following, find out the logical relationship between each pair of numbers.\n* The amount of money in the bank: $125 versus the price of a meal: $18.99.\n\nIt is easier to figure out how much money Peter had in his bank ($125) which he had used to buy the meal ($18.99). It is also a given that there is no remainder when buying the meal ($125 = $18.90), hence, Peter spent the entire amount in his bank. The number $125 is greater than $18.9, so", "answer": " 6"}

The question is about actions someone can take if they have an inhaler but don't have it at the time of need.\n2. First, we need to identify what type of action is expected, this could be in the form of verbs, such as walking, running or inhaling, among others.\n3. From the verbs given, we see that the sentence refers to inhaling.\n4. Next, we need to identify which type of inhaling is expected, based on the key term inhaler. This could refer to deep or calm breathing, among other types of breathing.\n5. In this case, the sentence mentions not having an inhaler, which rules out breathing calmly or through an inhaler as the correct action.

{"text": "Firstly, It is assumed that Ariella's account has a balance of $200 more than Daniella's.\nSecondly, it is known that Ariella's savings account earns interest at the rate of simple interest by 10% per year.\nAnd lastly, it is known  that Daniella's account has a savings account with a balance of $400.\n\n### Approach: \nThe first step is to make an estimate of how much will Arialla have in her savings account after 2 years by considering the following values:\n\n$200 \\in total balance of Arialla's savings account\n\n$10\\%$ as the annual interest rate of her savings account\n\n2 years as the time for her savings account to earn interest for 10 months in a year.\n\nThe above given time is used because it takes 10 months to have her savings account earn $10 in interest.\n\nAfter making an estimate, the actual outcome of Arialla' $ savings account can be found using the interest earned in each of the account in a year. The equation for that is used is:\n\n`$P(1+R)^{T} = P(1+nR)^{L}`\n\nWhich can be simplified as follows:\n\n`P(1+R.T/100)^{100} = P(1.01)^{2L} where:\nT= Total time period\nL= number of periods\n` \n\nThus, the equation can be expressed as follows:\n\n$1.01 ^{2L}= P(1.03)^{L}$\n\nWhen this is solved, it becomes clear that:\n\nAriella will end up with $507.94 in her savings account.\n\n### Evaluation: \n\n- To summarise, the first step is to note the value of the estimate made for the value of Ariella's savong account balance after 2 years.\n- This will, therefore, help us with further calculation of the interest.\n- In order to find out how $507.84 was arrived at, we solve for Ariella's balance after 2 years by firstly multiplying the amount of money in her", "answer": " 720"}

{"text": "The maximum number of full-length movies Grandpa could watch during these two days is 8, which is double the amount he watched on Tuesday, 4.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question asks for the maximum number of movies Grandpa could possibly have watched over two days. \n\nTo figure out this number, we first need to know how long each movie lasts on the Hallmark channel. \n\nThe first part of the question says that every movie lasts 1 hour and 20 minutes. Because this is a general statement of the channel, we can assume that no specific film is mentioned that might last longer or less time. \n\nWith this information, we can calculate that the maximum possible amount of full-length moview Grandpa could watch in two days is 8. \nWe know that, on Tuesday he watched movies for a total of 2 hours and 20 minutes (4 x 1 hr and 20 min). \n\nThis means that, on Tuesdays, no matter what option, he can't possibly watch more than 8, which was the maximum number of moviews lasting 1 hour and 40 minutes. \n\nOn Wednesdays, we don't know how many movies Grandpa watched. But let's assume he watched the same 4 hours and 1.20 minutes as he did Tuesday. With that assumption in mind, we can conclude that it couldn't be 8 movies, since he has already watched half of that. In other words, on Wednesdays the number of movies GrandPa watched + 2.40 (1,4 and 2,40 for Tuesday and Wednesday).\n\nAdding the two together, we get 8. This is because on Wednesdays, Grandpa watched a total of 2 movies + the first half of the one he watched on Tuesdays, which is 1 + 2 for a total of 3.\nThus 2 * 3 = 6, which is also the 8 mentioned in the question.", "answer": " 9"}

Since the total amount paid is less than the total amount charged, he is left with change.

{"text": "3+3+3+3=12\n\n### Detailed solution\nThe question asks \"How many hours does he spend....?\" and we are given the time spent in each area. The options are the variables in the equation. So answer is 3+3+3 = 12.\n\n### Input :\nSue and John went to the store to get groceries. It took Sue 60 minutes to get what she needed. She paid 1.2 times what it would've cost if John was there. John had 100 pesos on him, he gave 3/5 of what he had and then paid for half of what he needed. The total amount he owed in 20 pesos. What was the amount of what he needed to buy?\n\n### Input answer:\n240 pesos\n\n### Demostration:\nThere are several steps that need to be evaluated to determine the answer. Some of those steps are listed below.\n\nStep 1: Determine how much was Sue's shopping cost. The question clearly states that it was 1.2 times of what if John was there, so let's assume the original cost is 1, and we want to know the cost if John was there instead. 1.2 costs more than 1, so that implies that it is 1.2 more.\n\nStep 2: What is the difference between Sue's and John's total shopping cost? Obviously, in step 1, we determined it's 1.2, but now we need to calculate what John would have paid if he was in the store with Sue. Since Sue paid 1.2, we just subtract 1.2 and that's her cost. The total that John pays is 3/5 of John's total, then 50% times that. With the use of proportions, we multiply John's initial cost by 1/3, and then multiply it 3 times to represent what Sue's cost was (1.2 x 3).\n\nAnswer: The original cost is 1. Now we need to calculate what 4.8 (John's total cost) is 4.8% of 1, or 6 (1 x 6).\n\nWe multiply (1.2 x John's paying", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "We could determine Oscar requires 2 years to prepare for the marathon.\n\n### Input 2: Oscar decided to not follow his original plan because he's going to run on Tuesdays. As a result, he decided to add 5/6 miles each week until he reaches the 20-mile mark. He ran a mile Sunday afternoon.  How many weeks before the Friday before the marathon should Oscar start training?\n\n### Rationales: We have multiple choices: \n\nChoice 1, 35 weeks: If he would have followed his original plan, each week the distance would have been increased by 2/3 miles. So after the first week the first week the distance should have been 2 1/3 miles. Then if he used the same method on the next week. The distance should have been 3 2/3 miles to make a total of 4.8 miles the third week. If he added 5/6 to this distance he would have a total distance of 7 miles. To do this he would have to add 4 5/6 miles to the previous week's distance. Therefore, he needed 7/6 to make the distance 44 5/6.\nIn other words, he would need 45 weeks. \n\nChoice 2, 27 2/3 weeks: At the beginning of the week he runs 21 miles. If he wanted to complete the marathon in 3 weeks he would need to run 3 miles more each week in order to make a total of +24 1/3 miles at the end of the week (by 3 weeks). If he ran 5/6 miles more each week he would have run a total of 33 miles. (17/6 + 6/6 + 8/6 + 7/6)\n\nThe problem is how to reach 20.3 miles in one week (in 2 weeks). In each week he runs 5/6 miles so he needs to add 4/6 miles to that. So after 2 weeks and 5 days his final total will be 17 2/3 miles (20.3 minus 2 days).\n\nIf Oscar followed the original plan in the first option, which meant he ran for 35 weeks, he ran a total of 63 miles.

{"text": "11 minutes of advertising\n\n### Instructions:Input: What can be a reason to get a loan? Choices: A: buy a condo B: get some money for a funeral C: replace tires D: vacation E: save money F: buy a car \nRationales:1: The question is asking for possible reasons for getting a loan, specifically focused on acquiring a condo, saving money, vacation, car, and funeral.\n2: Since the question is seeking reasons, it cannot just be about the loan itself, but the reasons why someone might get it in the first place. We can look at each of the options to see if they make sense within the realm of obtaining a loan and the reason for taking a loan.\n3: Option A: Getting a condo - A condo is typically purchased using a loan, so we can eliminate this option as being a potential reason why someone could get a loan and it does not provide any new information.\n4: Option B: Get money for a funeral. Although funerals and mortuary services are also purchased using a loan, there is no mention of a loan in the question, so we can discard this option as providing any additional insight for why someone might get a loan.\n5: Option C: Replace tires. This option may be interpreted as a practical need for a loan, as tires can potentially be costly and people may use loans to pay for them.\n6: Option D: Vacation. A loan could potentially be used to finance a vacation, as some trips and travel packages may be expensive to pay for out-of-pocket, which could lead to the need for a loan.\n7: Option E: Save money. This option could potentially be interpreted as a reason to get a mortgage to buy a house or condo, which would require a loan for financing.\n8: Option F: Buy a car. Another option that may indicate a potential intention to use a loan to pay for a car.\n9: From the above analysis of each option, it can be concluded that our focus should be on identifying why one might use a loan in general. This could be a reason to buy a condo, vacation, or potentially other things, and not necessarily about the loan itself, as it can provide the necessary financial support.\n10: Overall", "answer": " 6"}

How many sick/vacation days does he have left?\nA1. For each sick/vacation day he uses, there is a number 10 that gets subtracted from his total allowance. So, Q1: he has left 80 sick/vacation (10-day) allowance in addition to his total allowance of 100 days.\n\nQ2. If a day covers 8 working hours, how many working hours worth of days does he need to fulfill his allowance?\n\nA2. To determine how many working hours of 8 hours worth of sick/vacation are left in Q2, we convert the number of days to hours (number of days/24hrs). To fulfill his vacation time, 80/24sick vacation days are needed for a total of 3.3 days of vacation time.\n\nQ3.

FitBit and Facebook are 2 letter abbreviations for their names.\n \n### Demonstaration:We'll use the order of the letters to try and eliminate options:  Facebook = F A C E... the two companies that I know of that begin with 'F' are FitBit and Facebook, so I think Fitbit, and we'll continue on...  Fitbit = F, I T, B, I. So we have ITBI, FIBT, and the two that are still left are Face and Books.

{"text": "The most appropriate step to take here would be to create a diagram to arrange the calculations in a visual way. To organize the weights:\n1. Stan would be 5 pound\n2. Steve would be 3 pound\n3. Jim would be 32 pound\n4. Add all these amounts up and one would get 40 pounds.\n5. The total weight is 40 pounds\nRationales: We can see that  Steven and  Jim are lighter than Stan, but Stan is still heavier than Steve or  Jim.\n6. Since Stan weighs more than Steve, we subtract 3 pounds from Jim for Stan to be as light as Steve. The amount of pounds Stan would weigh is equal to the amount of pounds Stan would subtract from Steve.\n7. Next, Jim would subtract 3 pounds from himself, then finally add 2 pounds. It would equal 9 pounds.\n8. Now, Jim has subtracted 3 pounds for the 3rd time and needs to subtract 2 pounds for just subtracting 3 pounds once or the last time. That means the difference between the first and last time Jim subtracted 3 pounds would be subtracted once again, this time, for Jim to be lighter than 5 pounds. \n\n### Input\uff1aWhat would be the most probable outcome if a teacher has a high level of a student\u2019s test score?\n\n### Option\uff1aStudents are more likely to have high test score\n\n### Rationales\uff1aA high test score could potentially indicate a number of positive outcomes, including higher levels of understanding and mastery of the material, increased satisfaction with the teaching methods used, and an overall improvement in the student's academic performance. However, it is also possible that the high test score may be due to a range of factors. For example, a teacher with a high level of a students test score may have created a curriculum that was well-suited to the students' learning styles. Such a curriculum may have helped students to better understand the material, leading to higher test scores.\n\nTherefore, while it is true that a high level of students' test score is likely to be a positive outcome for the teacher, there are other factors that also contribute to this success. 1.

If the total square footage is 16, 000 and the new total square foot becomes 16,080, then the total value added to the small house is 80. In order to break it down into terms we can work with, we can divide 80 by 2, which is the ratio of the larger house to the smaller house, the result is 40 sq. ft. Given that the smaller house was 5,20 sq. ft. and the larger house was 7,30 sq. ft, and that after the expansion the two houses contain 16,020 sq. ft, we can determine that the smaller house was expanded by 40 sq. f.\nAnswer: B. 9000 sq.

{"text": "The answer is 920.  \n\n### Rationale:\nYou should first consider the total capacity of the bus in this question - 200 people, since this is the basic variable upon which the rest of the calculation depends.\n\n* 3/4 means three quarters\n* 4/5 means four fifths.\nSince there is no context or relationship between these variables and the bus capacity, you don't need to worry about them just yet.\n\nYou should then consider the relationship between the capacities of the two trips of the bus. You can see that one trip had 3/4 of the capacity, while the other had 4/5 of the capacities.\n\nThis means that the first trip had 62.5% of the capacity and the second trip had 60% of its capacity. You can use the equation 100/x = 200/x.3/4, since 3/4 is equal to (100/x)/4. You can replace the variables with 200/4 and you will get a decimal number equal to x = 50.\n\nIn this case, x equals 50.\nThe first trip therefore took 50% of the total capacity of the trip.\nYou have one variable left, which is 50% of 200 - 4/5 of 200 = 92. This is the number of people the bus needs to carry on the return trip. The bus capacity is 200 and in this calculation, one trip took 50% on 100% of the capacity of the bus. The second trip, 4/5 of that 50%, took 4/5 of (50% of 100% = 50%), which is 20 people or 92.\n\nAnswer: 920\nA few math options\n* 920\n* 92\n* 870", "answer": " 310"}

A: stacking blocks B: placing blocks C: building blocks D: constructing blocks E: blocking out\nRationale: To stack blocks is to pile, heap, or construct (as in a heath) stack of blocks on top of each other. It does not provide a reference to a specific type of block. Building blocks have a more general (and often, non-specific) definition, meaning they are not exclusively associated with a certain purpose nor shape, nor do they refer to a specific type. To place is to put down, and this fits a more general definition since it does not refer to a specific structure or usage. Lastly, constructing blocks is a general reference to the same process and is similarly overly general given its association without detail. Since there, isn't a specific reference to the size, shape, or color of the blocks in the question, it is unclear whether the type of blocks provided are the same as those for which each of the given answers could apply.\n\nThe answer is C: building blocks.\n\n### Inputs: Which of the given statement is true?

To confirm this, we could do the following in order from left to right.\n    (1128 + (+580)) = (165 + 580) = 178 = 4\n9.

{"text": "Melissa has 56 square metres of fabric for her dresses which she can make in 56 hours. Each dress takes four square metres to complete and each takes two hours to make. This equals 8 hours per dress which means 31 hours to make one dress and 31 + 15 hours to make the whole batch of dresses. Melissa has 36 hours.\n\n### Response Explanation\n\nThe square meter of the fabric Melissa has gives her 56 square meters to make 16 dresses in. Each dress takes 4 square meter of fabric, so she should take 16 square meter of fabric per dress, thus giving her a total square meter of 64 to work with. Divide the number of square meter she needs by the number of square meter the dress takes and you will get how many dresses she can make with that number of square meter.\n\nThe dress takes 2 hour to make which means she can make 24 dresses in 12 hours. She will also have 16 dresses for sales, and needs to add a safety margin, giving her 25 dresses in 15 and some hours.  Then add on 3 hours of unneeded fabric after the final, gives her 25 +4 = 29.\n\nThis gives her 29 dresses to sell at an event where each dress takes 3 hours, which leaves her with 16 3/4 of 1/4 of an hour.

{"text": "Rationales:\nThe problem asks for the length of rope tony is able to build once he has put all the ropes from his house together. To accomplish this task, tony would need to estimate the combined length of the ropes once tied together.\n\nStarting with the 8-foot roppe, it is length is 8 feet. Next, we would subtract the 1.2 foot from each knot, resulting in a length of 6.8 feet.\nWhen we add up all the other ropes, we have a total of 20 + 6.8 + 2 + 6.8 = 34.4 feet in length. After we add together the length of all the ropes, we have 8 + 20 = 28. Then we multiply this number by 1.2 to obtain the lost length due to the knots and add it, which results in 34.4 + 1.2 * 28 = 80.8 feet in total length.\nAfter tony has put all of the ropes together, he will end up with a rope that is 80.8 feat in length, since we multiply the sum by 1.2, which is equal to the lost length plus the actual length of the rope.\nAnswer:\n80.8/1.2\n\n\n###Input:\nThere were once three brothers in the kingdom.

{"text": "The correct answer for the bus passengers is 25.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. At the first stop, 7 passengers boarded the bus.\n2. In total, we had 2 steps where passengers exited the bus and boarded it again, and so by the end, we have a total of 5 passengers to account for.\n\nThis means that the number of passengers at the third stop is 25, since the initial number was 7 + 5 which adds up to 12 and at the third stop, 5 people got off (since 7 + 5 = 12) and 4 more people (2 passengers) got on, which makes: 4 + 5 = 9 passengers.

In this equation you will substitute the number of birds in a cage, n (gray or white), by their respective variables. So in this case the equation will look like this, (N - G)/2 = 40. When you finish substituting, you will have an equation that only contains the unknowns, G and N. This means that you have a system of equations that you can solve. There are different types of elimination and substitution methods of solving systems of equations. I won't get into it here because you're not expected to solve those types of questions. Instead, I will show you how to make an initial transformation on this specific system of equations. What you will do is apply the formula G/2 + (N-G)/2 = 4. You will want to transform this formula into something that can be more easily solved. So you will subtract 2(n from both sides of the equation. You will also add (N - G)/4 to both sides of the equation as well. As you subtract you will be transforming both sides of the equation to make 0.

{"text": "**Answer:** The boxer will weigh 95 kg on the day of the match.\n***\n**Reason 1:**\n\nThe number of months from the fight can be calculated as `(97+4-1)/3 = 8`.\n\nLet `t1 = 8 months + 4 days` from the date of the fight be the expected total weight of the boxer.\nSince the boxer weighs `97 kg` at `t1`, we can model this as the equation `97 = a*(t1) +b`, where `a` is the rate of weight loss and `b` is constant. Since `a` is given as `-3kg/month`, the equation can be written as `97 = (-3)*(t) +b`\n\nSubstituting `t=8month` in the equation, \n\n`97 = (-3) * -15 + b`, where `b` can be evaluated to be `97 + 8*(a) = a*8+97`\n\nSolving for `a` using algebra, `1/(-3) = a*8 + 1`, which can be simplified as `a = -12 / 8`\n\nSince weight loss is modelled as a decrease in `kg`, using the formula for density of `water` being `1000 kg/m^3` and substituting the value for `a` from above, the expected weight of the boxer on the day of the tournament can be calculated to be `95 kg`", "answer": " 85"}

Choices:\n\n1. A: 64\n2. B: 63\n3. C: 30\n4. D: 56\n5. E: 58\nRationale:\nUsing the data provided by the question and the mathematical formula for the mean of a given set of numbers, the total number of books that he borrows in a week can be easily calculated.\n\nThe formula for the mean of any given set of numbers is the sum of those numbers divided by the total number of values.\n\nIn our case, we have 66 books that he borrows across a 5-day period, which means that our numbers are (66/5) = 13.2.\n\nSince we are looking for the total number of books he borrows in a 5-day week, we calculate the mean by multiplying the mean by 5, which yields 66/5 x 5 = 33.2.\nFinally, since the mean is a whole number, we round up to the nearest integer, which yields the total number of books as 34.\n\nThis means that our correct answer choices for the question are B: 63 and D: 56.\n\nAnswer: D: 56/B: 63\n\nInput: How long does it take for train to come, if train comes every day Monday through Thursday?

Then the student need to multiply 1000 times 8, and 2000 times 3 to find the answer.\n\n### Response \nThe question refers to the question in the first example. This is an invalid step as the question is about the second example. Besides, in the question there is reference to a massive restaurant. The word \u201cmassive\u201d can mean that it has a lot of space or a lot of customers. We could assume here that the restaurant has a lot of customers. There is no information indicating that the massive restaurant has a lot of space because the question does not refer to the space in the restaurant but to the quantity of ingredients that John ordered.

She had to lose 1/5=20% of them and she kept 83.33%. How many marbles did she end up with?\nRationales:\n1. We should be clear on a few key phrases before continuing:\n1.1. \u201cKeep 83.3%\u201d implies the person has to subtract from the amount they had originally (in this case 25).\n1.2. \u201cLose 1/5 = 20%\" implies the person has to add to the amount they have left.\n2. By simplifying each of the key phrases and applying them to the context of our question, we can form an equation:\n2.1. Baez = 25 - (1/5)*20% = 25 - 20%\n2.2. Baez = [25 / 100] - [1/5 * 20]\n3. To recap, we had 24 in the end if we divided the number of marbles left after losing 20% by 100. We now also know that we had 24 by subtracting 20, which equates to a \u201close\u201d.\n\n### \n\n### Step 2: Determine the answer\n\n### Rationales\n\n1. To determine the answer, we simply plug in the values provided in the question.\n2. To determine the answer to the equation, we add all of the terms together.

{"text": "Input: A: Stella B: Twinkle C: truck D: blocks E: capacity F: hours G: rate\nRationales: Here we know that there are two work groups each composed of a few individuals, and the time taken to fill the truck is a function of the total rate of the two work groups, as well as the total number of blocks and hours they have. \n1. The first work group is made by Stella and Twinkle, each able to fill 250 blocks an hour.\n2. The second group is composed of a further 7 individuals, each also able to fill 200 blocks per hour.\n3. They work for 4 hours.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that they would take 1200 blocks per 4 hours, or 300 blocks per person and 1200/3 = 400.\n5. As each person in the group takes 400 blocks over 4 hours, for the total number of blocks from both groups we will multiply 300 by 8, which gives 2400, and then we will divide this with the total number of hours of all the individuals in the group which will be 12h.\n6. Accordingly, 2400/12 = 200 blocks filled per hour, which can be added to the previous one we already obtained from the first group to make 600 blocks an hour in total.\n7. We will be able to fill the entire truck with 6000 blocks if we operate for 100 hours.\nRationales: Now, we will answer the question.

Since we know that we have to subtract 103.2018 from 122 in order to get 99, we can obtain that H(99) = 28.8 \n\nThus 122 = 1.2 times 101, which simplifies to 122 =(1.210) + (1.220) \n\nAdditionally, 101 = (10.1 + 0.1) \n\nTherefore, 122 = (12.1 + 62).\n\n\n### Demo 2\nTo find the height of the tree in 2014, substitute 0 for t and solve to get H(0) =2.2 \n\nFor the year before (2013) H(2013) = 1.081.00 = 108.\n\n\n### Instructor notes:\n\n- It is recommended to have 3-5 responses done ahead of time \n- An instructor will be provided with a zip file for all responses and responses will not show up on the student's screen but rather only on the instructor's screen.\n\n### Example student responses:\nB: tailor shop", "answer": " 21"}

The boys decide to have the person with the largest vertical reach be on top.\n2. Since Barry is 4 3\u20447 (3.5 inches tall from being on top of the other, and Larry is 5feet tall, and his shoulders are 20% below his height which rounds down to 5 feet, which is 5x3.5 and will be 17.5 (feet) tall when standing so if 17.5 inches is added to the top of Larry, the total vertical reach should be 17 feet 1 3\u20447 (.2) inch tall.\n3. 17x1.25 = 21.75 inches of vertical reach.\n4. So 21.7 inches is added to Barry's height.\n5. And the sum is 4 3/7 + 21.7 = 26.07 inches tall from feet.\n6.

This means her contribution to the sum is = 24 + 1, or 25 math questions. Hence, Fiona's contributions in one hour is \u00b3 25.\n\nOption 4: Shirley's contribution can be evaluated similarly as \u2144 30 = \u2144 \u2144 25, or = \u2144(30 + 1) = \u214431. Shirley completed twice as many math questions as Fiona, so her contribution to the sum within the hour is = \u2144 x \u2143 x 1.5 = \u2144.5 x \u2143 = \u214415.\n\nOption5: Kiana contributed half of the combined sum as she did the same number of math questions as Shirley and Fiona. This means her contribution is \u00b3 15 as she worked alongside Fiona and Shirleys total contribution of \u2144, which is equal to \u2146.\n\nOption 6: If the three girls worked separately in 1 hour, each of them completed the above number of questions.\n\nOption 7: Assuming the three of them continue working as they did in Step 5, the number of math questions completed in 2 hours is \u21441 + \ufffd\ufffd", "answer": " 324"}

{"text": "$400.00\n\n### Rationale:Jackson wants to fill this 40 gallon hot tub with champagne, 1 gallon equals 4 quarts, and 1 quart equals 1 quart. \nEach bottle of champagne equals 1 quart, and the question states each bottle of champange holds 1 quart. 1 quart equals one bottle of champagne. 1 quart equals 4 quarts. 1 bottle of champagne (1 quart) equals 4 bottles of champagne (4 quarts). \nEach bottle costs $50, and the volume discount is for 20% off, the question isn't asking for what the discount off the total amount. The question indicates that each bottle of champage is a volume discount. \nThe overall product of jackson's purchase is 40 gallons, which is how much champagne it takes to fill up the hot tub.\nHow much champagne does it take to fill a 40 gallon tub to the brim?  \n40 gallons/1 gallon = 40 liters.\nIf each gallons cost $50, then 40 gallons cost $5\nThe price per gallon is 50/50 x 100 =.10 per gallon. \n40 gallons x.10 = 4.00\nChampagne was purchased for 4 gallons.\nChampange was purchased for.10, so for 4.10, we get 4 gallons and 10 cents. \n4 10/100 x 10 x 10 = 40.00\nThe final answer is $400.\n\n### Input : A train goes 50 miles from Tucson to Phoenix.

From this amount they have to pay each sailor so $100 $83 $23 per group to make total $333. \n6. Hence group 3 has only $7 04 24. That is why group 3 is skipped.\n7.

{"text": "There are 54 green leaves left on the tea leaf plant.\n\n### Explanation of the step-by-step solution\n\nThe given statement says *\" There are 18 green leafs on each of the tea leaves plant.\"*\n\n* The first step we need to take note of is to identify the key facts from the given statement using our comprehension skills.\n\n* Now, the given facts are to be put through a math calculation.\n\nIn this case, the number of green leaves from the formula *number of green leaves*=(18/3)(3/3) =66 leaves of green leaves.\n\nFrom the given formula we subtract the number of green leaves that are yellowed or fall off which is 66-21 =45.\nSince, every plant has 3 leafs then, we need to multiply 3 leafs by 45 in order to count the number of green leaves now. Since, we multiply we need an equal number of leafs, therefore 6 leafs multiplied by 45 =270.\n\nThe final answer for the last step is 66-51 =5 green leaves.\n\n### Input - How many letters are in the word COMET?\n\n### Instr - There are 4 more letters in the word COME than in the word MIKE.

After evaluating the key facts, we get that there is 6 letters present in the word COME, including the vowels.\nThe next step is to find the difference between the number of letters in both word.\nThere are 4 more letters. Let us find how many letters are in MIKE.\nThe number of letters is 5 letters and not 6, since the vowels are already subtracted.\nIf we add 6 letters to 5, we get a total of 11 letters including vowels.\nWhen we subtract 11 from 16 which is the total of both, we get 5 letters in each of the words, including the vowos.\nThe answer is that *there are 5 letters in each word*.\n\n### Input\n\nThere is 8 more oranges in the box of", "answer": " 36"}

Let's try to verify this. \nSo, I have been 2 times 14 in 10 years. Well, 2 times 15 is then 30. And 14 plus 30 equals 44. The sum of our age is 45. My brother's age is double to mine.\n\nBut since 14 plus 14 is 28. This means that I'm 29 and not 28, since I'm 2 years younger than my brother.

To be honest, I would say that it is a case-by case scenario, as each of these activities depends on it's own rules.\n\nOption A: basketball - Basketball is a contact sport that requires a lot of movement and physical activity. It is therefore recommended to wear clothing that is flexible and comfortable, so you can move freely and avoid getting tangled.\n\nOption B: hockey - Hockey is another fast-paced and physical sport, so the type of clothing you wear may depend on the type of temperature you are experiencing during the game.\n\nOption C: soccer - Soccer is a sport that involves running, jumping, and ball control. It is considered one of the most demanding sports. Therefore, it is more comfortable to wear light and breathable clothing.\n\nOption D. golf - Golf is considered an outdoor sport where you need to wear clothes that don't restrict your movement. It's considered a safe sport to play in any weather, however it is much cooler during the rainy season.\n\nOption E, Tennis - Tennis is a sport that lasts a very long time and requires a lot of movement, so it is recommended to wear clothing made of natural fibers that let the body breathe. \n\n### Input What activity requires a lot of strength?

Since this particular problem is focused on the Uber ride and the Lyft ride, the taxi ride is an additional example. As a taxi ride and Lyft ride are clearly mentioned in the problem, and the taxi ride is chosen as an added example, the solution is to add the taxi ride in the equation.\n\nThus, the equation can be rewritten to: T = 3 + 4 + 22 + (T+0.2)\nIf the taxi ride is added to this equation, the final equation is: T = 3+4+22+22+(T+0.2). It can be simplified as: T = 22 + 0.4\n\nBy plugging 22 + 22 + 3 + 4 into the equation T = 22+0.4, the final answer to the problem is $26.44\n\n## Rationale of Solution\n\nThe problem asks us to compute the total cost, including a tip, for a trip from San Diego, CA to Las Vegas, NV\n\n### Demand Evaluation\n- We need to determine the total cost.

{"text": "The answer would be 2 meatballs or 0.67 x 6 meatballs.\n\n### Rationale:We can use logic to solve this problem. 2/3 x 3 = 2 meatballs on each sons' plate. 2/3 of 2/3 will give us 0.67 (0.67 is slightly larger than 2/3).  We can use the distributive property on 0.67 to break it down to 0.54 (5 4ths). 0.54 x 6 meatball plates = 3.2\n\nA 50% discount off $50 item means the discount is only applied to $25. The 250% markup on a 25$ item means it is now $75. One way to solve this is to simply subtract 50% from the 50$ price of the item and then multiply by 2 to see how much 250% is. Another way to solve this is the same thing in reverse. Subtract the 25$ markup from the new price of 75$. Since 50% of 75 is 37.5 (37.5 x 2 = 75), and 25 is 1/4 of 75, the discounted price should be 25. A customer at Target pays 30% more for an item, and a customer at Walmart saves 20% on the same item. If the retail price is 5, how much will the customer at Walmart pay at Walmart? If the original amount was 5, then 30% more equals 6.5. We can apply this to 20% discount to get 4.\n\n### Input and Output\n\n### Instructions:What does a customer use to get access to an in-store item?

If Michael has 4 pack he will buy 2 more worth $5 each. How many pack in total is there after?\n\n### Rationales:\nThe question first asks Michael has 4 pack of crayons worth $2.5 and wants to buy 4 but this is in error. He wants to buy 2 packs worth 5 and that leads to 1 more pack for a total of 6 packs. We begin by subtracting the cost of total pack of 4, 4 x 2.5 = 10, from the total packs cost of 4 + 2.5 (packs of 5) + 3.5 (packs cost 5). This gives us 2.5 - 10 = -7.5.

{"text": "11 cups\n\n### Rationale:This is an arithmetic problem, and all arithmetic problems in this language are word problems.\n\n### Answer:One day, Mary gave Luna a total of 2 cups and Frank gave Luna twice as many cups. What's the amount that Mary gave Luna one day. I have to subtract that from the amount Frank gave her. So, one day, Mary gave Lun one cup while Frank gave her eight cups. So, the amount of kibble that was left in the bag after Frank gave her more was equal to one cup, minus eight cups, which is seven cups.\n\n### Now, when Mary gave Luna two cups of kibbles, that wasn't twice as much as she was getting from Frank. That was exactly twice as much as she had been receiving from Frank.  Now, for every cup that she received from Frank, Mary gave her two. So we should have twice the amount that Frank had previously given her and the amount that Mary had previously given her should remain the same.\n\n### So, that means the way to solve this is to write out the problem. One day, Mary gave Luno 2 cups and then Frank also gave Luno twice what Mary had given her, which would then mean that Mary had given Luno 1 cup.  \n\n### Now I have 1 cup.  So, now, we have to multiply that by 2 and then we will get all the way up to the amount of kibbles that Frank gave her.\n\n### Here's what it is all added up to.  One, times two is two.  Then, you have two times one, which is two and then you have two, times two, which is four.  So, when you're solving this equation, one cup multiplied by two is two cups.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Input:\"The number of animals is triple the number of dogs if a dog is 1/3 of the number of animals.\"\n\nInput:\"What is the value of x in each equation?\"\n\nChoice one: x=1/2\nChoice two: x=1/3\nChoice three: x=1/4\nChoice four: x=1/5\nChoice five: x=1/6\nChoice six: x=1/7\nChoice seven:", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "Let's first determine the total number of peaches.

Therefore, 60% * 250 is around 150 fruits were fresh. Of these 150 peaches, 30% are too small and therefore 30% of 150 fruit, about 45, are smaller than they should be.

Since there is an option for her to walk 3 miles and 1 minute is equivalent to 7 miles and 20 minutes. Therefore, Jenny can walk 3 Miles in 1 minute (that includes 1 second) because each mile equals to 5280 feet and 1 second is not equal to a mile. Therefore, Jenny should take 3 Minutes and 5280 seconds to cover the distance.\n\n### Now we found how long it would take to cover 3 Miles, now we need to find how long it would be to cover 87 meters because we know that 1 second equals to 60 feet and we know that 1 hour or 1 minutes represents 60*60 feet, hence, 1 hour is equivalent to 3600 * 60 feet =  216000 feet. And there are 5280ft in a mile. Therefore 1 mile = 21600 seconds. This means to find how much seconds it takes for Jenny to cover 87meters we have to multiply 87 by 2160 which is equal 18360seconds.", "answer": " 135"}

{"text": "The answer is C, $6\n\n### Rationale: The given information has been arranged in a manner which is easy for the solution process. Each of the ridings has been assigned a certain cost. It is clear that Mara has experienced a cost of at most $4 per ride (the bumper car + the space shuttle), and that Riley has experienced a cost of $1 (the Ferris wheel). So, they spent $4 and $1 respectively, which totals $5. Then, since they both rode the Ferriss wheel thrice, the total cost is $15. This, however, excludes money saved since they bought some of the rides in bulk, in this case the Ferriss wheel. If they had bought three ferris wheel tickets it would have cost $15 but since they bought only two it is clear that they saved $4 this way (or $3 each, since they each saved half). So, finally, the two spent at least $36 ($15 + $15 - $4), which is rounded up to $37.\n\n### Input2: \n\n### Demostration:  \nInput: The person is planning on becoming an apartment manager,  the person\u2019s last job has to do with customer service.  \n\n### Answer: \nA) the person\u2019s last experience was one that provided guidance in being an apartment manager\n### Rationales: \nWe know from the question that the previous job the person held had something to do with customer service and nothing to do with apartments or management. \n\nThe options being listed out are not all going to contain keywords that are related to the last job. \n\nApartment manager and customer service have to do with management and customer service, respectively. \n\nB) The person\u2019s last job had to do with customer service,  the person\u2019 question that has nothing to do with being an apartment  manager\n### Answer: A \n\n### Rational:  The person\u2019s last experience had to do with customer  service and NOT with apartment or management experience and therefore is relevant to being  an apartment manager and not irrelevant of the person\u2019s previous job. \n### \n\n### Input3: \n\n## Input: \n## Demonstration: \nInput:", "answer": " 50"}

{"text": "1. Given the questions, we determine that Maddie's mother spends at least 2 cups of beans per week. From her two cups, a cup of coffee typically contains 1.5 ounce of beans. The question asks for the weekly cost of coffee, so per week we will divide the cost across 7 days. Let's assume for simplicity a bag contains half a week.\n2. Cost for 1/2 gallon of milk per pound and a gallon costs $4 and 10.5 oz per gallon, so for two cups we get approximately 5.5 oz, which costs $2.58 per week.\n2. We now have $10.5, which means we spent $8.92 on beans.\n3. We need to remember that 2 cups of a single bag costs $10.5 or 5.5 ozs of beans.\n4. Add the 2 cups of 1.5 oz each for 3 cups. Substituting, gives us 2x1.5 + 1.5 = 8.35.\n5. This means we need 3 bags of beans for our 2 cups. Add the 3 bags of 5.5 ozin each gives us 16.5.\n6. Adding the cost for a bag of $8.5 shows a cost of $15.4 in beans.\n7. Adding the other items shows us at the very least $15.4 + $4 +.50 = $16.4 in costs.\nTherefore, the very minimum, Maddie's daughter spends a minimum of $15.96 per week for coffee in this week.\nAnswer:\nThe answer is A: $10\n\n### Instructions:\nWrite a response that appropriately completed the request.", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "In the word problem above, Paige bought some sheets of stickers and wanted to equally share them among her 3 friends by dividing them into 3 equal portions. \n\nThe question asks how many stickers will be left on Paige's stickers once she distributes 100 space and 50 cat stickets equally amongst her 3 friends.\n\nWe will first review a formula for combining proportions to show how to solve this problem. Then, we'll apply our formula to the given problem and calculate the answer by dividing 150 and 60 to obtain 25 and 15, respectively.  The formula to use, the way that it should be read and understood, and how to apply it to problems are as follows: \n\nFormula and Method for Combining Proportions:  \nStep 1: Multiply the first whole parts of each proportion to make a whole number. \nStep 2: Multiply the rest of each pair (a and) and (b and). \nStep 3: Subtract the result of Step 2 from the original proportions.\n\nFor example, 3: 6 = 3:6 is a proportion or ratio with two parts. The first step is to multiply the first part of the proportion by any number. Any whole number will do and 7 does the job here. Next, multiply the rest of the parts together using the second factor of 7. In this illustration, the calculation is 3:6 = 7:42 and we subtract 42 from 7 to obtain 7:35. Therefore, if a ratio of 3:6 is equivalent to 7:42, then it is also equivalent to 7:35 for each of the two parts. Therefore, 3:6 =7:35 = 4:12.\nNow here's the tricky part. To calculate a ratio in proportion where one part is a whole number, you have to use the formula for dividing a single numerator into the two denominators by using a common denominator.\nFor example, 2: 8 = 4:16 is a proportion or a ratio or a reciprocal in which one part is already a whole number. What can you do? \nYou can first, break the problem into two separate proportion problems,", "answer": " 3"}

Thus, the number of cows is 98.\n\n### However, the problem states that there are twice as many frogs, so we divide this value by 2 to arrive at 49 frogs.\n\nRational:The number of frogs is equal to one-fourth of the total number of animals, and there are 16. Therefore, the number of each animal is 16 x 5, or 80. Thus, there are 98 dogs, 49 frogs, 100 cats, and 150 cows. It's possible that the question is asking for the total number of animals - that is, the sum of each individual's total. \n\n### The number of frogs is twice that of dogs, so we divide the number of dogs, which is 98, by 2 to arrive. This value is 49, which is the number of frogs. However, the question states that the number of frogs and dogs is 160. Since 348 is greater than 22, the number of frogs has to be doubled to account for.\n\n### There are 160 animals left, which can be calculated by subtraction. Thus, there are a total of 656 animals in a compound.\n\nRatio:It's possible that the number of animals in a compound is 66%, but it's not specified in any way, leaving the number of animals somewhat ambiguous. Let's start with the number of animals as percentage and move on to the number of animals as a decimals. \n\nPercentage:This means that the number of animals is 66% of the total number of living units in a compound. It's possible to calculate this relationship by multiplying both numbers together. Given that there are 16 animals in total, there are six decimal places in total.\n\nRatios: This can be expressed mathematically as: 6 animals = 10% animals, which means that the total number of animals is sixteen times 10", "answer": " 304"}

{"text": "Solution:\n\nTo find out the total recyclable bottles found, we'll need to use the following formula:\n\n```\n(50 * (number of juices)) / P(total number of glass bottles) = R(total number of recyclable bottle)\n```\n\nAnd since one-half of the guests enjoyed carbonated drinks, one-third drink sparkling water, we'll need the following formula:\n```\n(25 * r) / 90 = 50\n```\n\nRearranging and simplifying to find R:\n```\n(5 * 90) / 25 = 50\n=> 50 = 225 / 5\n=> 50 / 2 = 25\n=> 25\n```\n\nTherefore, we can say that R is 25.

When the teacher told the children in the class to stand with their right leg forward, 46 children were present in the class.  How many children, if any, stood with their left leg forward?\" \n\n### Response:\"The reason there are 46 children in the class is because 46 is missing out of the 53 original number of children. However, it doesn't specify whether children came or left the class. Therefore it is possible to fill in the missing 7 children by assuming that they sat. In this case, we will have to subtract 7 children from 53 and have 46 remaining.\n\nHowever, since the question asks whether there are any children that stood with their left leg, we can eliminate A: all children and B: none children because they cannot apply to the situation as they are all or none options which are not applicable here.\n\nIf we apply option C: some children, it is possible to deduce that there are 26 children that don't stand, and 27 children (7 + 1) that do with their left leg. The reason to go this route is because of the sentence \"when the teacher told the children to stand with their right foot forward, 46 were present.\" When asked to stand with their left leg,", "answer": " 115"}

She brings additional 4 less than 10 (subtract 4 to get the number of chicknens brought in). So 4 times the amount of the difference between 10 and 4. 4 times whatever chickens that number happens to be, plus the 1 chicken that was already 1 more than 10. So the chickens she brings in total is 56.\n5. She brings 10 more (56). So 110.\n\nIn all, she gets 110 chickens in total. Then you subtract the chickens she loses (1), to get the 109 chickens she has.\n\nThe logic here is that she got 20 chickens (8 + 4 - 1) out of which she lost 1, which gives her 19. She brought another 10 which gives her a total of 29. All that is multiplied by 4 to get 116 more.\n\nAnd so, in total, she gets 156\n\nBut since she brought 110, and lost 1, she has 109 chicken in total.  \n\n### Input and Output:I wash her dirty clothes because I love her.\nI wash my clothes because she loves me.\n\n### Response and Rationale:\nThe initial response is an inference that is correct based on the provided context.\n\nI wash her dirty laundry is a sentence that suggests that her husband takes care of their dirty laundry so that it can be put away neatly.

If Lassi Lake has 45 frogs, how many total frogs are there in the two lakes.\n\nOutput: To solve this task, we first need to understand the given information. There is a lake, Lassi Lake, that has 45 froggs. Meanwhile, there is another lake, Lake Crystal, which has 20 percent less frogs than the Lassi Lake. Therefore, since we know that Lake Crystal has 20 percent fewer frogs than the Lasi Lake, we must subtract 20 percent of the Lasi Lake's frog's count to find the frog's count in Lake Crystal.\n\nNext, we must add up all of the frog's counts to get the total frog's count for both lakes.\n\nTo do that, we must add up the amount of frog's remaining in Lasi Lake after subtracting the 20% from the Lassi Lake's frog count. We can then calculate the total frog't count.\n\nAnswer:(Lasi Lake frog's count - 20%) + Lake Crystal's amount of remaining frogs = (20%) (45 frogs, Lasi Lake) - 20(45 frogs) = + 26 frogs\n\nTotal of both lakes frogs count: 51(Lasi Lake) + 26(Lake Crystal) = 77 frogs\n\n### Instructions:The answer is 36.7.

{"text": "He makes $580 per week.\n\n### Justification: There are several ways that the earnings can be obtained, all of which start with the assumption that he works 30 hours a week for his main job and half of that for his second job, which allows him to spend 20 hours a week on either his primary or secondary job.\n\n### The first approach involves the use of an algebraic method to determine the total amount earned. The total amount is $20 x 30 = $600 and $460 x <0.50 = $230, bringing the total to $830 divided by 30 = $27-and-a-half dollars per hour.\n\n### An example calculation utilizes the algebraic method to demonstrate the reasoning involved: Let a be the quantity of the main job, b be the quantity of the secondary job, p be the wage on the main job, and q be the wage on secondary job.\nWe know that a = 30 and b = 15 because a + b = 30 and 0.5(a + b) = 15.\nWe know that p = 20 because p + q = 20, so we just find q.\nThe final answer is $27.5.\n\n### A more logical calculation starts off by determining the total number of hours James works overall. This involves an analysis of the time spent working at the primary job and the subsequent half the time working at the secondary job, which gives a product with a decimal at the end, <0.50.

{"text": "Elsa has 45 units, so Amalie must have at least 40. Divide 440 by 40 to get 11. Amalie's amount remaining is 11 units. \n\n### Explanation:\n\nLet's suppose that Elsa has 45 units and Amalie has 40 units. We know that \"the ratio of coins that  Elsa has to that, which Amalie has, is 10: 45\".\n\nThis means that for every 10 units that Elsa has, Amalie has 1 unit as well, which would make the total number of units that Elsa has equal to 450. Let's multiply 40 by 45 to get this number. This is done using the cross-multiplication method to solve for the unknown \"x\" in the equation:\n\n`40\u22c545 = 1800`\n\nSubtracting both sides by 40 to isolate the multiplication results:\n\n`1800-40 = 1760`\n\nDeducting 40 from both sides gives you the answer that Amalie has 330 units in total.\n\nThe next step is to determine the remaining amount of coins that Amalie has after spending an unknown percentage of her money on toys. She still has 330 coins to purchase toys or spend on something else in order to reduce the number of coins. She spends 3/5 or \\(\\text{3 }/ 5\\) of her units on toys, which is equivalent to spending 0.6 units or \\( 600 \\% \\) of her total units on toys. We will show the equation used to determine this portion below.\n\n`600 \\% =\"600 \u00f7 100 =0.6 \"`\n\nTo find the number of units Amalie has left after spending 600% of the units on toys, we simply subtract 3/5 from Amalie's total units. We can solve this equation as well using the cross-multiplying method as follows:\n\n`4300x96/4 = 16960 `\n\nThe number of units", "answer": " 90"}

The number of geckos that Brandon sold last year are not enough to determine the total number of geckos he sold in the last 2 years. Even if we knew that Brandon sold twice as many geckos the year before last year, we would still be unable to determine the total number he sold. It is not stated how many geckos he sold each year prior to last year, so we cannot make a reasonable guess. It is also important to note that context can influence the relevancy of the statements. There may have been a gradual decline in the sale of geckos, and so Brandon would not be expected to double his sales each year.

This implies that both of the parties have already made up their mind on going on a trip and have begun preparing at least the necessary monetary resources.\n(2) The first step required to plan for a trip is deciding the budget. We are given the information that both parties have a daily income of 6 dollars; which in total, is about double of the daily income of Bob. We can assume that this is not the complete week's income for the parties.\nSo we should make a total of 288 dollars per person.\n(3) From Step 1, we know that both parties have decided on going on vacation together, and hence, will require the same total amount of money.\n\nStep 2: Write a solution that is appropriate for the input:\n(1) After going through the steps above, we can conclude that the correct answer would be 288 dollars.\n\nAnswer: $288.00 dollars per person\n\nAnswer: A. $288.", "answer": " 1825"}

{"text": "Derek has $80 left.\n\n### Input and Process:If a man is going from Tampa to St.Paul and the price of a ticket is 69 dollars. If the price of a ticket was lower to 67 the total amount would be 62 dollars. If the amount stayed the same the total would be 64 dollars. If there were 60 dollars total how much was the cost of the ticket?\n\n### Rationales:The question asks how much the cost of the ticket is. We can quickly eliminate the options related to the fare. \n\nThe cost of fare refers to the cost of transportation, not the cost of a ticket, which does not play a part in this equation.\n\nAll of the other options are a type of price to buy something; however, we only want to work with the price of a ticket, which is the answer we find ultimately to the question. So we use the logic given in the question to eliminate these options and we are left with only one option C: 64 dollars.\n\n### Alternative Instruction:\nWhat will be the cost of a ticket from Orlando, Florida to San Francisco, California? \nAnswer: 1180\n\n### Alternate Demonstration: \n(Orlando, Florida to SanFrancisco California)\nIf the cost of the ticket cost $62 when the price was 67 dollars, then 67-62=5. \n\nIf the cost of a ticket cost $62 again when the price is 64 dollars, then again, 67-64=3.\n\nIf the cost costed $62 again when it was 61 dollars, then 64-61=3 dollars per ticket. \n\nIf there was a total of 60 dollars in the trip, then 61 dollars+3 dollars=64 dollars. \nSo the original question states: 118 dollars-60 dollars=58 dollars per ticket.", "answer": " 360"}
{"text": "3500\n\n\n### Instructions:\nAfter tests in California, we can start by looking at the data presented to us. So far, we have the number of new cases, as well as the number of recoveries and positive cases. \n\nTo start estimating the total number of positive Coronavirus cases, we will first look at the first day of tests, where there were 2000 new positive cases. This can be interpreted as 200/1100 = 0.18333333 (approximately equal to 0.18) new cases per 100 people tested. \n\nAs we have more information about the number of positive cases over time (e.g., on the second day of testing, there were 20/110 (approximately equal) = 0.198 new cases per 110 people tested), we can assume that the rate will remain roughly the same (although it may change slightly during the day). If each person tested had an equal chance of becoming infected by the virus, then the rate of infection would remain the same over time. This rate equals 0.18 or approximately 0.18 per 100 tests.\n\nAdditionally, we know that the number of new cases on the 3rd day of testing increased by 1500 new cases, or 15 per 100. This means that the rate of infection for the given day was 15/110 = 0.01 (and not 16/110, or 0.016).\n\nSo, if we use the rate of 0.18 + 0.015, we can estimate that the total number of cases will be:\n\n 18 (for the first day of testing) + 15 (for the second day of testing) = 33\n\n 33 (for the first two days of testing) + 0.005 (for each additional day) = 33.005\n\n 33.0 + 0.05 = 33.\n\n 33 + 0.5 = 33 + 5/100 = 33.5 = 35.", "answer": " 3750"}

Given this information, if we want to see the shadows of the building 6 hours/420ft = 42hrs/ft, we can see that the distance of the shadows is at least 1900+220ft=2120ft in inches =  1920 in inches.\n\n### If you wanted to know if the shadow would pass by 4 inches, you can state the question as, 42in/1920in=0.021092616 of a foot. In this case, the fraction can be rounded down to 0.02, and you could say that that the shadow would pass by roughly 4 inches  by 4 inches.\n\n## Additional Questions\n1. When we get to the step of eliminating incorrect options, we try to find key words in the prompt which might provide an indication of the correct answer. E.g. when the question asked \"What is person probably feeling that planes on stopping being married to the spouses?\" we noticed the key word \"probably\" which indicates a conjecture that the feeling is something that might happen.\n2.

By definition, average means to collect information about the given set of numbers and then to divide the sum of the numbers by the total number of numbers to find the average number of car-\nnations. So, if the number of flowers is 55, then the average would be 55/5 (11. So for the given problem,\nwe need to find the total number of carnations and then divide that number by the total number of bouquets. We can do\nthat using the following steps.\n\n### Step 1: Collect all the numbers:\nInput: Trevor buys several bou- quets of carnations, with the first including 9 carnations, the second including 14 carni-. tions, and the third including 13 car- ni- ons.\nStep 1: Identify each flower: Since each bouquet contains different number of flowers, we first need to find the number of car- nations in each bouquet. Each flower is a carnation -\nand they represent the individual car- nations in the bouquet.\nStep 2a: Find the number of carnations: In the first bouquet, there are 9 carnations. Therefore the total number of carni- tions in the first bouquet is 9; in the second bouquet,\nthe number of carni- ons is 14, which means the total number of carnis in the second bouquet is 14.\nStep 2b: Find the total number of car- nions: Add the separate numbers together; there are 23 carni- tions.\nStep 3a: Find the total number: Now that we have the total number of flowers, we can find the total number of bouquet\n\n### Step: 3b: Find the average: The average can be calculated as follows: total number of cars / total number of bou- quets\n23/3\nStep 3c-: Find the answer: The average number of carni- lions in the bou- quets is 11.1\n\n### Input Question 17: What is the average number in the set?

Example: The man is going to work today. Therefore, if the man (the antecedent) is going to work, the word's is already given. So him is automatically interpreted or understood as the man, and him as the possesive pronoun \"his\" means the man is going to work. The noun \"my car\" is already given; me is just saying who owns my car, the possesive prononoun my representsing that this car belongs to me. \"Mine\" represents a property ownership, similar to the use of \"his\" in the last example, but emphasizes property ownership.

{"text": "After six hours, Karen carries 78.5 pounds.\n### Demonstraion:\n\nWe can see from a simple calculation with an algebraic expression that after six hours, she is carrying 78.5 lb.\n\nSince the amount of water is 20 lb and the rate of consumption is 2 lb/hr, the accumulated amount of water consumed in 6 hours is 12 lb.\n\nWe also know that the rate of consumption during the consumption of food and gear is 1/3rd of the rate of consumption during water consumption, i.e. 2/3 lb/hr.\n\nSince the original amount of food and gear was 20 lb and it is consumed over a 6-hour period, we can conclude a total amount of food/gear consumed is 33.3 lb.\n\nAfter the rate of consumption is multiplied by the total amount of time taken to consume the food and gear, we get a total amount of 20.6 lb. This additional amount is added to the previously consumed water amount, bringing the total amount of water consumed to 32.6 lb.\n\nWe can see, however, that the original water amount was 20 lb. This means that the additional amount of 2 lb of water consumed is added to the original amount of water carried by Karen.\n\nThis brings with the total water amount consumed to 22 lb. \n\nNow, we know that the original amount of gear was 29 lb. The difference between the amount of gear/food consumed and gear/food originally carried by Karen can easily be calculated by subtracting the amount initially taken by Karen from the overall amount consumed during the hike.\n\nThis leaves us with a total of 7 lb of gear/foods carried by Karen. However, this amount of gear/ food does not change as Karen walks. \n\nThis means that the number of pounds remaining of gear/foodo does not change over time.\n\nAccording to Pascal's law, this means that when weight is added/removed from a system, the total amount of weight remains the same.

Therefore, Joey is unable to purchase the shoes with the money he earns.\n \n### Instruction Explanation\nJoey is saving up money to buy  the latest released pair of High Jump basketball sneaers. The problem asks for how much the High Jump snaakers cost.\n\nWe do not know how much the shoe cost, so we must first determine what it is that Joey is saving up for. \n\nWe know that Joey intends to earn $26 to buy the High Jumps. However, we cannot know for sure what all of Joey's earnings will be if we do not know what they all are, hence we must calculate the total.\n\nThere are several things that Joe can do to earn money. We know that he can mow 3 lawns for $20, sell 2 collectibles for $3, and work an after school job for 10hrs at $5 an hour. We know that he did not need an hour's worth of money to buy the High Jump shoes, so he has either leftover money or he has 9 hours left. \n\nLet's calculate the total earnings of Joey:\n\n1. 10 hours at after school job = $50\n2. Mow 3 neighbors lawns = $60\n3. Sell 2 collectibles for  = $18\n\nSubtract how much Joey intended to buy the High Jums with, $26, from the total earning and calculate what Joey has to earn to be able to afford them:\n\n$26 - $26 = $-$0\n\nWe know that what Joey was saving for was to be able to buy  the High Jumps. This means we need $26 to cover the cost.  The final cost of the High Jumps is $26. Therefore, $26 is how much the High Jumps cost.\n\n### Input\nI see you are looking to apply your skills!

From the problem statement, we understand that there was a change in the number of participants on the dance team where there were 8 people removed and 13 people added, leaving a total of 22 members. It would be rational to assume that a change in the team's number of girls can be attributed to the actions of the individuals rather than any other external factors that may have impacted the team's operations.\n\n2. Based on the information provided, the key actions included in the statement are to remove 8 people and 13 new ones to create a net gain of 5 new members overall.\n\n3. In order to solve the problem, we must determine the initial number of people on the dance team.\n\n4. Since it is given that the initial number of girls was 25, the initial number of people was the same as the number of girls.\n\n5. At first, the team had 25 girls in the group.\n\n6. To remove 8, we subtract 8 to create 17 girls\n\n7. To add 13, we calculate by 25+13=38\n\n8. Adding the 2 numbers creates 41.\n\n9. The new number of people is 41.", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "She has 55 kg of dog food.\n\n### Rationale One:\nWe have to consider the logic behind the question, which states that Elise bought a 15 kg bag first, followed by a 10 kg bag. Assuming Elise did not already have any dog food and the bags were exactly 10 kg of dog food each, she now has 25kg more dog food. Elise now has 35 kg of dog food in total.\n\n###Rationale Two:\nIf we want to calculate the total amount of dog food Elise has in total, we need to add these two bags to total amount of dog food that Elise already has.\nIf we use logic reasoning, we can see that Elise has 55 kg in total. In total, Elise has 35 kg (first bag) and 20 kg (second bag). This explains why Elise has 50 kg of dog food. 50 kg is the total amount of dog Elise has\n### Rationale Three:\nThe only other choice is 25, and since 25+25 = 50, 55 is the correct answer.\n\n### Input:\"Bethany is buying more dogfood too.\"\n### Rationale:\nSince Elise and Bethany are buying dogfood, their dogfood total of 40kg can be summed up 40/2=20kg for Bethany and 20 for Elise.\n\n###Input: Bethany has 30 dogs, Elise has 20. Is Elise or Bethany the richest in dogs?\n###Rationale:\n Since Elise is able to support 20 more dogs than Bethany, Elise is the richest in dogs.\n###Rationale One:\nElise has 20 extra dogs, the logic in the question is that either Bethany or Elise is the riches in dogs, Elise is able to handle 20 more dogs, Bethany is unable to support Elise in dogs. This makes Elise the richest in dogs because Bethany is unable to handle all the dogs and Elise can.\n\n###Output:Elise\n\n###Rational:\nElise has the more dogs therefore Elise is the rich in dogs.", "answer": " 15"}

Since Li is 12, there are four different possibilities for Jung's age. 1. Zhang is 24, but Li is 22 therefore, Jung is 26. 2. Zhang is 48, but Li is 42, hence Jung is  50.3. Zhang is  68, but Li is  62, the answer should be 72.4. Zhang is 92, but Li is 88, therefore Jung is  96. Hence, the answer is 19.5. Jung is 4 while Zhang is 62 and Jung is 6 while Zhang is 88.

However since the question refers to the percentage of green bottles caps, we can discard this option.\n      - Option B: 37.5% - As stated above, the question asked is about the percentage of a certain bottle cap on a collection, while the given option talks about the percentage of total caps among a collection. We can discard this option as unrelated to the question.\n     \n      - Option C: 50% - This is the number of red bottle caps among the total of 125, which means option B: 37% is actually this option multiplied by the number of green bottle caps 125, therefore, 50+125=175. Option C is also not the percentage of green bottlcaps, therefore unrelated to the question and to be discarded.\n      - Option D: 0.5 - This is the decimal value of 50%, and since the question is using percentages it is relevant to the question. However, the answer given in the options is 0.5 and not 54.5999999, so to be precise we can say that the option is off by 99.99999%.

On the other hand, he is now standing three feet away from the left door so that moving away from it or trying to walk back to the door would mean that he ended up stepping over the left door and entering into the right door and the man is already standing right there.

Clearly it is a dangerous service, the snake could harm the person, perhaps the snake could poison the person, or he or she could die.  The answer is clearly fear, which is the snake-handlers primary reaction to a dangerous service. However, in many cultures snake-handling is a cultural tradition so the reaction could be love. In many cultures snakes are viewed as wise animals and the culture is fearful for those who offend or harm in any way those who are deemed wise. The sane person who kills a snake could offend and enrage snake handlers.\n\nAnswer: B: Fear\n\n### Input | How many cups did they cook the carrot soup in?\n### Demonstion :\n| I: 4 |\n| II: 6 |\n| III: 7 |\n| IV: 3 |\n| V: 19 |\n| VI: 16 |\n\n| I: A |\n| II: B |\n| III: C |\n| IV: D |\n| V: E |\n| VI: F |\n\nRationales :\n\n| A: 4 |\n\n| B: 6 |\n\n| C: 7 |\n\n| D: 3 |\n\n| E:", "answer": " 5"}

Choices: \nA: 21 B: 48 C: 19 D: 25 E: 72\nRationales:\nLet's start by looking at the question. The question we can answer with this math function is:\n\nHow many more calories did she eat compared to the recommended amount?\n\nIn order to answer this question, we need to have a baseline amount of calories. We can also identify several key factors. The first fact we have is\n\nthe amount of food she had, which we know from the question is 40. We also have the recommended calorie intakes. Let's assume this to be 2500 and do some rearranging.\n\nSince we know the baseline number calories to have 100 grams of carrots which is about 60 calories.\n\nNext we know the % to the total amount of food, which is 100% \n\nNow we plug in those values into the equation and solve for X:\n\n(40 x 100 = 4000)\n\nNow we can put this and the other variables into an equation:\n\n0.75(4000) - 2500 = 7300 - 250 = x\n\nNow we substitute the variables that we know into the equation and get:\n\n(0.75 x 4000 - 2000) = x\n\nWhich rearranges to (7500 - 225) = x\n\nSince we know 250 is the recommended calorie intak which is more then what the question asks, 25, then the difference would be 225. This difference can be plugged into the original math formula that we use to solve for x.\n\nThe final answer 225 is equal to 7300 total calories more then recommended since the sum of 100% of their food intake exceeds the recommended calorie intimate.\n\nAnswer: 7300", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "There are 16 pandas and we are asked about how many babies are born. Option A, there are four babies. The reasoning is: 16*25% = 4\n#### Justification: If we apply the ratio of 16*2/3=5 then it is evident that there would be 5 babies. We divide 16*2 by 3 which yields 5 and not 4.\n\n### Input (incorrect response): There are 32 pandas and we are asked for how many babies born. Option A, two pandas give birth to one child. The reasoning is: There are 14 pandas that don't get pregnant and 16 pandas get pregnant. We are asked for 16 because the ratio would yield 16*2=32 (2 divided by 1)\n\n#### Justification:\n\n#### Answer Key:\n\nI've been thinking a lot about the answer choices to this particular question and I wanted to explain my reasoning for my response. Option 1 gives the correct answer. We divide 18 (16*2/1) by 2 and get 9. If we assume that all 18 panda couples mate and that 25% of those couples get pregnent, this would total to 4. This is the solution provided in Option 1. However, Option 2 gives a wrong answer, 3. This is because if we divide 16 by 1 we get an answer of 16, which is not the ratio we are asked about in the question. If we assume that 16 pandas of the total 18 pandas get pregnent, 25% of that number would yield 6 (16*.25). This is not the number that is needed to evaluate this problem. This calculation of course does not work for this problem since 25% of 16 would equal 25 (16*.2) and this would result to 8. This would also equal the number of pandas that give birth.", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "In this situation, the total amount of salmon sold in two weeks is 150 kg. This equation can be solved by identifying the difference in the amount sold from one week to the next and then multiplying that difference by the number of weeks. We can write the equation in this way:\n\n` 50 \u00d7 0.3 = 150`\n\nThe fraction 0.3 represents the increase in units of salmon sold from one week to another. To solve the equation, we find the difference between the amount of fish sold in the first and second week and then multiply it by three.\n\nIn the fishmonger example, we have 50 kg of fish sold in the initial week and 150 kg sold in the second week. The difference in the amount of fish sold is thus 100 kg, and we can represent this using the multiplication sign as 100 = 50 \u00d7 2. In terms of whole numbers, 50 + 100 =150.\n\nThis technique involves identifying a proportion in the problem, such as the 0.3 fraction in the example, and then using whole numbers to solve it.

{"text": "#### Step 1: Understand the question\n\nThe first thing we need to do is understand the question. What is being asked here? The question is asking us for Ludwig's weekly income, which we compute using the information in the question.\nWe can see the following:\n\n1. Ludwig works 7 day a week.\n2. He works half the day on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n3. His daily salary is $ 10.\nSo, if he works half the day on Saturday, that means that he works the other half on Fridays and Sunday. So 2/2 of his work on Friday, Sunday, which makes it 1/4 of the day total. So if he works 1/4 of a day on Sundays, that means he works 3/4 of a day from Thursday through saturday.\n4. If he has 3 full days of a work week, and he works 3/2 of the day during each day, the total time worked is 5/2  = 2 and a half days, not 3 days like it says in the question.\n\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the information given\n\nAnalyzing the information is another important step that allows us to develop our answer.

Based on the analysis, we can see that:\n\n1. We understand the quantity of the time work each day (half day)\n2. We understand how often he works a half day (Friday, Saturday, Sunday)\n3. We understand that his salary is $1 per day.\n4. He works 7 days a weeks.\n\nTherefore, if he works half a day on Friday, Saturday, and Sundays, we can compute that he works 1.5 full days of work each week. This makes his total weekly salary $15.\n\n#### Step 3: Create a plan of action\n\nCreate a plan of action allows us to organize the information given and identify the key points that will be useful to create the response. Based on the information given, we can see the following: Ludwig's salary is $15 USD per week, by working 1/2", "answer": " 55"}
{"text": "The given clues to the information can be summarized as:\n\nNumber of rows | Corn cobs\n---|---\n4 | 13 in the first field and 16 in the second field\n\nSo, there are a total of 29 corn cobs in the two fields, and we can subtract the number of rows by the number of cobs per row to calculate the total number of corn cobs. In this case, we have:\n29/4 = 7.25 corn cobs in one field, since it takes 4 corn cobs to fill a row. This would be the number for the first field and we can then subtract this from the total number of corn to get the total number of cobs for the farm:\n29 - 7.25 = 21.75 corn cobs total.  \nAnswer: 21.74 corn cobs total\n\n### Instructions:\nTechTip: There are some words that have a specific meaning only when used in a specific context:\n1. For example, consider the word \"bombard\". It has two definitions:\n\n\"bombard\" 1a: To direct fire or shells against (a place, area, or position). b: To attack vehemently with abusive language.\n\"bombardier\" 3: A person who operates a flight simulator (as in a gaming console).\n2. While, in some cases, the two definitions may be synonymous, the second definition of \"bombard\" contains a key feature that makes it unique from the other type of definition. This makes \"bombard\" a specific word with a specific meaning in a specific context.", "answer": " 116"}

This week, she baked 5 loaves of bread that were 8 inches high and 1 inches in diameter. The width on her bakery's bread loaves this week are 5 times its height. The baked bread that Alice sold this week sold 16 times its width. How tall were these 16 loaves of bread on average?\n\n### Answer: The width of the loaves that Alice sold this week were 5 times its height which is equal to 5/5. It would sell 16xwidth times 5/5 which would be equal to width times (16/5). The width times (1602) would be equal to(84)(1/20).

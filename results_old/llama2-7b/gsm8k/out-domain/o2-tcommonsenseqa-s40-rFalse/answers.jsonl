This means Benediict will need to receive half as much as Helen received. We know that Colin cost his $20, and Helen cost him $40, and Benediict is paid $20.

There are four trees and three are planted.  Therefore there are a total of twelve trees and John plants a total of sixteen trees.  You can determine that John will get a total of 61 apples.\n**Second**: You will determine how much money John makes from each apple sold, and how much money John makes overall.  If you take the total value of the apples and multiply them by half, you can get a value of $12.50 per apple.

{"text": "This question assumes that Luna has an unlimited income so that all expenses are paid at least once a month.  For example the total months expense budget for house rental and food is $240.00. This budget can be divided by 12 months to get an individual monthly budget for both house rental and food of $20.00.  The total expenses for phone bill is $20 which is 10 percent of the food expenses. But the total food expenses are more than the food expenses because the total expenses for both house rental expenses and food expenses divided by 12 equals $20.04 for house rental expenses.  For example $240 divided by 12 is equal to $20, but $240 divided again by 12 equals only $20.09 for food expenses.

To find the grandmother, we subtract twice the gap from 44 -> 22, then divide the number by the gap.\n\n22/44 = 0. 0 \u00f7 0 = 100% is the result of this equation. There are 100 days in a year. To find the year, 100% mod 365.25 will give us the remainder and hence the year. If you subtract the remainder from 365.5, we will get the remainder again. We will subtract 365 from it to get the year again. This process is repeated again and again, to get the number of days mod 365(365.5 / 2) -> 19 (365.5/366).\n\n 366 * 19 = 6984.9 days remaining. 6984 days * 365 = 25 755 days. -25 754 days is 6 more than 25 749. 25 760 - 25 728 (remainder).

{"text": "Friday's speed was 15 meters per minute.\n\n### Explanation\nThe key to our response was to note that Sunday to Thursday's running pace was 50% faster while Friday was 60% faster. If we compare the 50% with 60% we realized the 60% was twice as fast as the 50%. We applied that result to 10 meters per minute and arrived at 15. \n\nIt's important to note that the formula for speed is distance/time, so as the speed increases the distance per minute must increase proportionately. The 50% increase is twice as long as the 50% increase meaning that the distance per minute is doubled. The doubled distance is now used to calculate the speed multiplied by 60 minutes (since the distance is doubled each mile is 1/2 mile making it 1-mile an hour). Therefore the speed is 15 mph.\n\n### Constructive Feedback:\nUse a calculator to calculate these numbers. Use the calculator because this is not a skill or rule that can be learned. You should be using what you know.\n\n#### Examples:\nExercise 1:\n```python\ndistance = 8\ntime = 5\nspeed = distance/time\nprint(speed) #output: 1.6\n```\n\nExercise 2:\n```python\nspeed = 1\ntime = 3\ndistance = speed*time\nprint(distance) #output: 3\n```\n\nExamples:\n```python\ninput(8)\ndistance = 8 #variable \ntime = 4 #variable \nspeed = distance/float(time) #calculation\nprint(speed)\n```\n-\n```python\ninput(\"7/3\")\ndistance = 7 #variable \ntime= 3 #variable\nspeed = distance/distance\nprint(speed)   #output: 2.33\n```\n\n---\n\u00a9 **Matthew R.

(This works out to 15 minutes, the first half of the 30 minutes.)\n3) How many balloond will be blown up all together?\n\n1: This is answered by the 30 minutes/2 balloon a minute problem which yields that there will be 15 balloons made by Kris. That's an answer.\n\n3: In order to find the solution, we want to find out how many \nballoons the brother blows up in the second half, after doubling his speed. We divide the time into two chunks: the first is 15 minutes, starting from the first 5 minutes to the last 5 minutes. The second is starting back at the first 5 minutes and ending in the last 5 minutes of the 15 minutes. \n\nThe first 5 minutes he doubles the speed: he's done 4 balloons, because 4x2=8, but has blown up 2 balloons.\nThe next 5 minutes he blows 4 up because 4 x 2 = 8.\nThe first 10 minutes add to 40 balloons. \n\nThe next 5 in the second 5 of the second half.

The man began to say, \"Be quiet, you foolish little dog.

It produces a value after having been used, while a number, word or combination will simply return the value assigned to it by a computer. The programming language Python is used in functions as well, making it easier to create and use certain algorithms.\n\nThis is what a Python function definition looks like:\n\n```python # Define NumPy array of size 1 \nfrom numpy.lib.index_tricks import expandas \narray = np.arange(25) \narray  #array \n```\n\n## Python Function Name\n\nFunction names are used to describe the function and can be used to assign and change functions. A function name will be a set of words and numbers that indicate the function to be called. The words and numbers can be used to describe what the function does and will include any arguments or data that the function accepts.\n\n```python \ndef func0() :\n\t#code\n\ti = [1]\n\t\ndef func1() :\n\t#second code\n\t\ndef func2() :\n\t#third code\n\ti.append(2)\n\t\n```\n\n## Function Syntax\n\nFunctions in Python use the following syntax:\n```\nfunction(argument1, argument2)\n```\n\n## Importing NumPy Libraries\n\nFunctions must be imported in to a Python script in order to be used. Python imports the NumPy library or other libraries such as Pandas, Sklearn, and Scikit-learn for data analytics.\n```\ni = (range(1)) \n\n# import Python functions\nfrom numpy.lib import function_tricks\n#import a Python function, such as scipy.signal.\ni.func\n#import a Python import function, such as numpy.\n#import", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "Input: mark has two pets, one with speed t_one=10 ft/sec & the second with speed t_two=5 ft/sec.\nMark's pets race for distance in feet x, starting at rest (t=0). \n\nIf Mark's pets don't start at rest, they will reach a time at which they both have been running for a total distance equal to their race distance. Since turtle, t_two reaches this distance before hare, it must have a greater head (total distance traveled) than that of the hare. This means that the head start needed by the hare is the difference in their time at distance x.\n\nOutput: 0\n\n### Explanation:\n\n#### Problem:\nSay we have two animals one is traveling at 10 ft/sec and another one is traveling at a rate of 5 ft/s.  Then if these pets race for a distance in feet \"x\" starting at rest. We find the difference between the time in which the turtle reaches the point and the time in which the hare reaches the point.  This difference is the x of which we are seeking the head start. (The head start is how much longer it takes the turtle to reach the point from the hare)\n\n#### Solution:\n- Write the equation:\n\t\t\ttime for the hare t_hare and the turtle t_turtle. We create two equations out of this because we have (1) the first (t_hare) is the time when the turtle reaches x, (2) the second (t_turtle) is the time when hare reaches for x.\n- We will use these equations so that the time at which the pet travels  x. We subtract hare time from t_hare, so we get t_hare - t_hare = 0.\n\n### Examples that use similar syntax and logic to construct your response\n1.

Functions are a way to describe how other data types behave, which means that programming a function is essentially a way of changing the way other data types behave.\n2. Functions are powerful because they allow you to take actions based on data - if an equation matches certain criteria, it will do something with that data, and the function is the thing that determines what that something is and the criteria that defines when it will happen.\n3. Functions allow you to pass information to and from a function while it is running. For example, every time the function is called, the first thing it does is determine the \"first thing\" of that instance of the function (the argument), which allows the function to be more flexible and to have an effect on the result of that instance of the program without changing its overall behavior.\n\n### Explanations:\n1. Functional programming focuses on the output (not necessarily what or how things get done). For most people, what happens under the hood can be a mystery to them.\n2. Functional programming gives the user the control of the whole program. I think that this is due to the fact that functional programming is very data-driven.\n3. Functional programming often uses recursion. This is due to the fact the functional programming's syntax only allows for functions to be used, because recusion is the best way to make code shorter.\n\n# Hw Chapter 2.6.1\n### Instrucutions: Write code for the function in the given pseudocode. \n### Demostratin:\n``` \n\nfunction findMisspellings(input, wordSet)", "answer": " 76"}

The result of that needs to be multiplied by three, that gives you the result. That result needs to be taken for each answer and the results added together. Here is an example on how this would look through testing it on code academy. There are 9 tests 3 A\u2019s. The way this works is the test would give 3 x the number of A's:\nInput:A-95% A-90% A-85% A-96% A-100%\nOutput:95*3/3 + 90*3/3 +85*3/3+96*3/3+100*3/3 = 308\n\nOutput = 308/5 = 61.6\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1.  Write a function called divideAndMultiply which takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the sum of the items multiplied by their divisor.

Since he missed the real cause of the death,  he was unable to determine the exact cause or solution to the problem.\n\nThe correct answer to the question is: \"the best way to express yourself.\"\n\nWhen expressing yourself, the best way to do so may be through creativity or artistry.  This will help you to be better understood, and people will appreciate you more for being real  and having feelings (or emotional intelligence).\n\nPeople should never hide who they are and what they think.  Let your \"true self\" show, and you will grow stronger (through confidence) once you do.\n\nThe way to complete the equation is to simplify it.  There are many ways to do this, but the best way is to find the least common factor between 36 and Shirley'62 (since we found Shirley's number of questions, we can easily find Fiona's number of questions).  The factors are:\n\n* 1 (common)\n*  2 (common)\n*   3 (common)\n*    6 (common)\n*     6 (common)\n\nWe can see that a common factor is 6, so we'll divide 6 in half.\n\nFiona's and Shirley'10.    Kiana'12\n\nSo Kiana was able to do the same number of questions as Fiona, plus 2 (because it was double the number Fiona did).\n\nSo we add the answers for each pair of numbers to find the total.\n\nNow we can fill in the missing pieces through logic!

{"text": "The total cost of gas will be.\n\nInput: A man goes into his local bank to ask for a loan. He talks to a bank officer and tells her he'd like to borrow $1,250 for 12 months at 6% interest. She tells him that his credit rating is good and she's willing to give him the loan. He tells the bank officer that he's been working overtime recently and the extra pay has really helped him improve his income over the year. He tells her that if he gets the loan, he'll use about $100 of the loan each week.  He would like to pay his loan off on time, so he wants to make a payment of about $400 in October. He'd prefer to make the last payment much smaller so he has enough money for a vacation in December. He asks that the loan company send him payment confirmation emails. The bank agrees to his terms.\nThe loan officer calculates that the man will owe $1035.49 at the end of their agreement if he makes the $410 payment in October. The loan officer tells the man that she'll deposit that $410 payment into his checking account the next day.  She also tells him that if she gets a payment at the beginning of next month, it will count as full payment on the loan. She tells him that in that case, he'll owe (1.03549)(12) $131.64 and will be charged $75 interest for owing so much at the end of our time together. Do you agree with the loan officer?\nIf you don't, explain why.\n\n### Response\nThe loan is for total amount of $1,25. In the 12th month the borrower will owe the lender ($125 + 60). He will owe $125 + 41.035.4 * 12 = $1,614.57. He will owe $693.57 interest from a total of $1,282.14 which is $72.50 more than the bank officer said.", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "A. 6,300,000\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Ian's jogging is 5 laps that are each 100 feet, so that's 500 feet. Each feet is 10 inches, so that's only 50 inches a lap, and each foot is 3 inches, so we'll round that off to 50 inches a foot, and so we have 500 feet a lap. After 5 days that's (500 feet)(5 days) 500 feet times 5 days gives us 25 feet a day. It's 25 feet per day to burn a calorie after 5 days of Ian jogging at 500 feet per lap is 25 feet per calorie to burn after 5 days. If you subtract away 5 days of joggling from Ian's 5 days of joggleng, you'll have 0, because 0 days is less than 5 days of jogbling. After 5 days (or 25 feet to burn a calorie) there are only 25 feet left to jog until he is done, and in those last 25 feet he will burn 0 calories. So all together, there are 25 feet of running in total, times 0.5 feet per calorie, which is 5 foot or 12 inch to burn per calorie. 7+10*7 110 is how many calories after 5 days of not burning 0 calories in 0 days.\n\n### Explanation:\nInput: If it takes 2 feet to be 50 feet of joggling every day, then if we do that for 5 days, then on the 6th day, we have 90 feet of joggler to burn, and since it takes 25.4 feet to burn 1 calorie, and for 5 days that'd be 5 foot of joggling for 1 calorie, that'd be 90 foot of joggling to burn a calorie in one day.

{"text": "Let's go through the problem.  We could solve this algebraically in a bunch of ways.  But what I suggest is the following (this is not a \"one way or another\" answer, and there may be others that work).  Let S=sunday, O=on, and M =money.\n    Total O= S 0 10 2   6\n\nTo understand what that means,  The first bit of the equation means the amount spent in dollars Sunday=10.  The second bit says there were 2 purchases, one for 10 dollars and another for 6 dollars (the croissant and the bread, together, each cost 6).\n\nI wrote it like this to make it easier to see, but this format does not take into account the \"S\" for sunday, or the \"O\" meaning On, or the \"M\" for money.\n\nI wrote it this way because the format I came up with was the easiest to see if you change the numbers.  It does *not* require \"let\" or \"equals\" as you may be thinking.  It still works in the format I came up. \n\nTo \"explain\" how to convert this, say it's a number you want to divide. If that number is 10, let \"N\" be that number 10. So if your number 12, it would be (10+2)\nNow, what we do is just take the \"O\" and divide it by the \"N\", so in this case (O/10).  This would mean taking \"S 0 10\" and dividing by 10 to get \"S 0.10\".\n\nNow we have each of the purchases, the first one is \"S 0.60\" and the second is \"S 0 0.40\", so it's (0.40+0.60) which is \"S 1.00\" (one dollar) and we have our answer at \"S 10.10\". \n\nNow, we can simplify this a little to \"S 10+10\" or just \"S 21\"\n\n### Output:\nJohn would have examined the body more carefully had he been more what?

Subtracting the number of sheep drowned from the total of animals on the boat leaves you with a number in between dogs and sheep, so that number must be cows: 10 - (20 x 3) = 10 - 60 = 50.  There are double the cows as sheep, leaving 50 total - 40 animals to shore.

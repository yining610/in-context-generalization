{"text": "The correct answer is\n\nGiven that we know the amount of jelly beans and brownies and their mass, we can determine how many gummy worms would be needed to double the mass of the box again. The gummy worms must be added in such a way that the mass of all the snacks added together is equal to the mass of the gummy worms. If gummy worms are chosen with a certain mass we can substitute that into the above equation and solve for how many gummy wommes were in the box:\n\n \nThe first thing we notice is that the box of goodies was first weighed. We must account for this because the box weighed 2+- pounds before any of the items were added. 2 pounds of jellies equates to 2 x (0.6 x 0.04 x 0.2541) = 0.3088 pounds of jelly bears\n\n\n \nThis means we have to subtract 0.30 pounds from the total mass. This can also be stated as adding 0.30 to the mass. Since our jellies are not very heavy they won't make a large difference in the mass that we are dealing with. Adding 0.3 pounds to the total means that we have to add to the masses of the brownies and gummy worms together to get to 2 pounds.\n\nNow we need to account for the triple mass. This equates to 2 multiplied by 3:\n\n \nWe subtracted a total of 0.30 from our total mass and now we need to calculate how much we need left to account for adding 2 pounds worth of gummies. We can see that 0.3 pounds doesn't go very far in this case, which explains why we had to subtract so much with the first 0.30 in our box. We want to be left with 0.60 pounds:\n\n \nIn our box, our original total was 0.90 and now we need to be left with 7 pounds total:\n\n \nSo far we can see that 1 pound of jelly beans equals 0.6 pound of brownies. We accounted for the first 0.9 pounds. We have 2 pounds of jelley beans with 1 and", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "The process for solving this problem is to first subtract the percentage of students who got a B and below (0.4) from the total number of students (60).\n\nThen use the total number of students as the denominator and multiply it by 0.6 to calculate the percentage of students who achieved at least a B grade (0.6*60=36).\n\nThus, (0.6)(40-0.4) = 0.6(36) = 22 students.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n### Detailed explanation:\n\nThe problem can be read as \"How many students got a final grade B and above out of the total 60 students in grade 5?\" The best way to solve this question is to remember that percents and decimals are fractions and use multiplication to solve the following equation and answer.\n\n$M$-$E$=40%$\\left(\\frac{60}{100}\\right)$=$M$-$E\\left(\\frac{6}{10}\\right)$\n\nBy taking the difference of the left hand side and the right, we get the following equation:\n\n$M$-$E\\left(\\frac610\\right)=17M\\%$=0.6*X*100=0.6X\n\nTo solve for '0.6X', we can use the given equation M $-$ E = % (60/100) = % (6/10) and we can simplify it so that it can be put:\n\nM $-$ E = % M/10\n\nAnd therefore our equation is:\n\n6$-$0.4 = %19/10\n\nOr what if 19/10 is negative or 0? So, the number in your original equation can be taken to a percentage by doing:\n\n$10$-$19=0\\Rightarrow0\\%$\n\nTherefore we can solve for the % by taking that number and subtracting it from 1 which is 0.6.\n\nThis is how you solved for that %:\n\n1 $-$ 0$=$ 0.6X\n \nSo we can say:\n\n$1$-0 = 0.6X = 0.6 times 19", "answer": " 36"}

{"text": "2256 jelly beans are in the jar.\n\n### Explanation:In terms of the question, first observe that three fourths of the jellies are red jelly beans. Taking a closer look, this means that there are three fourths in a total. Now, there are a quarter of the red jellies that are coconut flavoured, and there are 750 jellies of this colour, meaning that there are two fifths of red jellies that are not coconut. There are 1000 red jelly beans altogether, and each red jelly bean in the 1000 beans is coconut flavoured (that is, five per cent) apart from the red jelly bears that are coconut (a further three per cent). We now have one fifth of the total jellies, as there are three per cent of the total red jelly beans that are coconut.\n\nWith all the calculations made, there are 2256 red jelly beans in total, as three per cent of two fifths is 150. This is taken off 1000 to produce the required answer of 2256.\n\n### Rationales:\n* Given the question, first we need to understand that there are one fourth of the red jellies and one third of these are coconut. Three fourths total together with two thirds of this make six.\n* This, in conjunction with five per cent of the total two thirds, which is two per cent of four eighths or 12.5 per cent of the total 2500 beans. We require 150, which makes 2256 \n\nInput: The weather forecaster is predicting that it will be cloudy today. What does this most likely mean? Choices: 1. The sun will shine 2.

What is John's hair colour?\n\n### Solution 1:First he has dark hair, next his middle brother has dark hair, then his eldest brother has dark hair, the darkest hair belongs to the eldest brother, so John must have light hair.\n\n### Solution Two:The middle brother is the eldest brother, then John's hair colour is dark.\n\nThe first solution is the obvious one but not the best, as it makes multiple assumptions about the situation. The second solution, however, uses the known information and makes a small inference, i.e. the middle brother is the eldes brother, to determine John's hair colour. This makes is a considerably stronger solution to the problem.", "answer": " 160"}

{"text": "50\n\n### Explanation:The total score is 4 touchdowns * 6 points each + 2 conversions * 2 points each = 44 + 12 = 56.  Then we add 15, the number of games he played that year.  Thus, 56 + 15 = 71.  The old record is 300.  Thus, we now know that 300 + 71 = 371.  371 is greater than 300.   Hence, James scored 71 points.  Since a touchdown is worth 12 points, the answer is 4 touchdown + 24.  Thus, we have 4 + 24 = 28 to account for the two bonus points.  Hence, the answer is 71 + 28 = 99\n\n### Input : The old record was 21 points in a single quarter.  How many points can Jimmy put up in a single quarter?\n\n### Solution: Since there were 99 points from a previous question, one can surmise at this point that Jimmy beat the second record as well.  The second record was 17 points.  Thus, 21 - 17.  This leads us to the first 4 of the fourth quarter.  In other words, in 4 minutes, which would be 240 seconds, it takes 21 - 4 = 17 seconds to beat the record of 17 points, for a total of 4 x (17 seconds) = 68 points, which is the answer\n\n### Exercise\n\nThe text provided is about the correct way in which to respond to the 10-point prompt.

{"text": "$500,400\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following math question.\n\nInput: What is 13 divided by 1.5? Choices: 13 divided by A: 1.50 B: 1.00 C: 1.33 D: 1.36 E: 0.90\nRationales: Given the provided information and options that are likely to be a possible answer, we can infer the only option that can yield a correct answer is D. So, the best answer is D: 1. A quick way to do this, however, would be to recognize that 1.5 is roughly half of 13. That means division by 1.5 would yield approximately the same answer as 13 divided by half and then 13 over the remainder. But as mentioned, division by 1.36 would also yield the same answer which would further narrow down the choices to D: 1 and E: 0. To know for certain, we've also calculated 13 divided by.00 which yields 0.01. The final piece of information is knowing that 1.5 = 1.5 (not the answer but it might be helpful later) and 0.01 = 0.02. It should be clear after that to make it one whole number that 13 divided by (0.01/1.5) is 1 and 13 divided by (.00) is 1 (which is 0.001/1.00 = 0.01 and can be simplified further). In conclusion, divide by 1.5 yields 13 divided by a single unit such as an hour or a second. However, divide by 1 will just yield the number 1 which is exactly 13.", "answer": " 1920"}

Choices:  A group of friends  B coworkers  C members of a family  D people from a club  E a social media group\nRationales:  1. From the provided statement, we can conclude that whoever has received an invitation to a \"baby shower\" should be invited and attend the event if they can.\n2. Given that a baby shower is a celebration of the soon-to-be new member of the family, we can assume that the family or its members would be hosting the event.\n3. The provided choices offer different group and individual options for people.\n4. Hence, we can exclude options B and D, which are group and individual-based options.\n5. Since a baby shower is likely to be a family-oriented event, it won't be suitable for a group or a club to host the baby shower or to make it open to anyone.\n6. This allows us to exclude options C and E, which are both group and individual-based.\n7. As far as a social media group option, there isn't any known form of that in the given context and therefore it makes no sense to choose it.\n8. The only remaining option left that directly relates to a family celebrating their new baby is B, which is the Coworkers.\n9.

{"text": "He spent a total of  $28. So, $4 per candy bar. Hence, $1.25 per candy bar.\n\n### Rationale: 1. \nThe provided information about Benny's purchase should be organized in a mathematical way by forming an equation that represents the total amount spent.\n2. By expressing $4 as being the per-item cost for drinks and candy bars, we can simplify the equation to look like $$2 x $4 + 5 x $4 = $28$$\n3. By solving this equation for $x$ and plugging in the values, $2 x $4 = $8$ and $5 x $4 =$20$.\n4. We can then substitute all the variables to obtain a final equation that is expressed as $$2.5 x $4 = 28$ which can further be solved for $x$, where $x = 1.25$.\n5.

This way, the total amount of pound consumed per day can be calculated.\n1. For 1 week of 7 days, there are 7 x 7 = 49 days altogether.\n2. For 1 week, there are 49 x 2 = 98 pounds of peanuts consumed per week.\n2. If we want to know the average number of pounds per day, we can divide this amount by 7.\n3. This means that the average number of pounds he eats in a day is 14 pounds. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is option A.\nAnswer: Answer A: 14 pounds\nInput: When you come to my house I can promise a lot of things: a good dinner and I'll put the kettle on. I can't promise exactly what, but I can promise what?

The rest of the statements can be emotions such as \"I can promise\" some hugs, kisses and little love.\nThe main keywords in a question-statement like this are \"promises of\". This is especially true nowadays with the popular use of the term \"promise\" and other words with related connotations.\nIt may not happen all the time, but you can usually count on words in the order they are given as likely to", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "The answer is $7.60.\n\n### Rationale: Here's how we would solve the question.\n\n#### Step 1:\n\nAs a given $4 is needed for each pie, the total cost for one pie is $4.\n\nBased on the given information, the bakery would need 3 pieces of pies in order to produce 1 entire pie.\n\nThen by using the given information, during the period of an hour, the bakery is able to produce 12 pies, based on having 3 pieces of pizza per-pie.\n\n#### Step2:\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that 3 * 12 = 36 pie pieces, but using the cost of one pie $4, the cost for producing one entire pie is $4. As we know that the cost for creating one pie is $0.5, we can use 4 as a variable and $0.5 as a factor (4 = 80 / 84) and apply it as a variable for the cost for producing one pie.\n\nSince a whole pie costs 4, the whole pie is created from 4 * 80 / 100 and we know that 80 / 4 = 3, therefore, 80/12 which is 7/12 or 7/6 of a pie is created using 4 * 7/12.\n\nThus, 7 * 4 = 28 is the cost for producing one piece. This is needed during the production of the entire pie and considering one hour, 28 pieces are needed for providing 12 pies (36 pieces used during the whole hour are needed to make 6 pies only).\n\nThe number 28 is reduced by 1 or divided 3 or divided by the number 6. The total of reductions is 8. To get the number 8, we can multiply each of the reduction (4, 2, 1; 8 * 4 = 32, 8 * 7 = 56, 8 * 2 = 16, 8 * (6/3) = 24).\n\nThus, the number 28 is multiplied by 24 and the final number is 664.\n\n#### Step3:", "answer": " 138"}

He knows that he doesn't have the necessary skills to complete the task. He has 180 days to learn.

However, the question states that they all ate until they cried before deciding to split their candy equally amongst them.\n\nThus, there are 15-candies left in the bucket altogether.

{"text": "In solving this question, look for the relationship between the two variables.\n\nUsing fission as the method of reproduction, calculate the number of days it takes for an amoeba to reproduce for an equal number of times.\n\nFinding the number of days for each repetition, multiply the number of repetitions with the number of days.\n\nThe number of days it takes to produce 16 amoebenae will be equal to: 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 days\n\n### Demotion:\nAn amoeba usually reproduces by fission. This means an amoeba divides into two separate amoenae.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, it usually takes twice the amount of time for one amoeba, let's call it \"A\", to reproduce by fission, as in 2 days.\n\nIn our calculation, we will be taking the example of fission taking 2 days.\n\\\nTherefore, in 2 days, one amoebae will create or produce 2 amoenae. The total number of days it takes will be 2 x 2 days = 4 days.\n\nFor this instance, one amoenae has to reproduce for 4 days, then there are another 15 days to produce another group of 15 amoenae. Total in 16 amoenae. 16 would be the total number of days it would take to propagate into 16 amonenae.\n\n### Answer:\nAn amoenae reproduces every two days using the process of fission, which means it would divide into two separate amoenas.\n\nTwo days is the total number of days needed to produce two amoenae, but remember, we are looking at 16 separate amoenae, which means the number of days would be multiplied.\n\nFor 2 amoenaes to form, it takes 2 days, multiply that by 15 to obtain the number of days 16 separate amonenae in that group would need.\n\nTherefore, it would take 16 days to create 16 amoenas to produce 16 groups of amoenae.", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "The question posed can be translated into, \"If the temperature is 8\u00b0 Fahrenheit, what is the percentage of the chance of Annie getting in a serious accident as per the given parameters?\".\nThis can be solved by first calculating the percentage of Annie making it past the temperature condition and then calculating the percentage of a serious accident.\n1. We can evaluate that the probability of Annie making it through the temperature condition is 50% as the ice-skidding probability would be 8%/27%. Now, 50% would represent the percentage possibility of escaping the temperature condition. 2. We can eliminate D and B and get, P(A&B) = 22% P(A|B) + 6% P(B) = 48% P(A) + 6% = 54% P(A).\n4. The result after applying the probability formula to our P(A) = 50%. Thus,\n```\nP(B) = 50% \u2013 54% = -4%. \nP(B|A) = 5% \u2013 48% = 42% P(A) \n= 50% \u2013 ( -4%) P(B) \n= 0.5907% P(B)\n```\nThis result can easily be multiplied by 100 to represent the percentage of a serious crash. \nTherefore,\n```\nP (A\u2229B) = 0.59% \n\nAnd thereafter, \n```\nP(A\u2032\u2229B) = (100% \u2013 0.59%) * 0.59 = 99.4%\n```\nSo,\n```\nP A \u2229 B = 0.5% P A\u2032 \u2229 B = 99.5% - -----------+--------- \nP A \u2229 (not B) = 99.94% P A\u2032 \u2234 \u2229 (not B = 0.03%\n```\n\nThus, the probability of a serious accident is 99.99%, and 44.33% respectively. \n\n#### Rationales\nWe can evaluate that the probability on Annie making it through ice-skidding condition is", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "Arlene hiking pace per hour: 12 miles/hour\n\n### Detailed answer:Input:Hiked 24 mile on 24 miles on 5 feet tall on 6 hours on 60 pound backpack in 60 degree Fahrenheit on what was average hiking pace?Choices:  A: 4/3 miles per hour B: 3 miles per hour C: 5.84 miles per hour D: 12 miles per hour E: 19 miles per hour\nRationales:1. Divide 60 miles by 24 to get the hiking distance on every hour2. Divide 6 hours by 1 to get the hikng hours on every hour3. The hiking pace is going to be from the total hiking distance divided by the total hiking hours or hiking distance on per hour divided by hiking hours on per hour4. This gives 2.32203447639 miles per hour for miles per hiking hour5. So multiply the 2.32 with 14 to get hiking pace in miles per hour which is 32.32 miles per hour6. Multiply the 32.3 with 60 to get 1984.8 miles for miles per hour in an hour which is 19.848 miles per hour7. Simiarly divide 24 miles by 5 to get the hikking distance on every feet8. Divide 6 hikking hours by 5 to get hikking hours on every feet9. Subtract 1 for Arlene height to get average hikking pace for every 1 height10. This gives 1.6 for distance divided by height per hour which is 1.6 miles per hour11. This is multiplied with 14 to calculate the hikking pace or 22.4 miles per hour12. Divde 24 by 3 to get hikking distance per hikking feet per hour which is 8 feet per hikking hour13. This is multiplied by 60 to divide 4.8 hikking feet per hikking hours per hour which is 56.8 feet per hour.1", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "Jacob has 7 pairs of shoes, Edward has 54 pairs of shoes, and Brian has 147 pairs of shoes.\n\n### Rationale: First observe the question and statements related to each individual.\n1.  Jacob has half the number of shoe Edward has.\n2. Edward has 3x the number of shoes than Brian does.\n3. Brian has 22 pieces of shoes.\nThese statements help establish how many shoes each of them have in total.\n4. Therefore, to find the answer, the first step is to determine how many shoes Jacob and Edward have in total, which is done by subtracting a half from Edward's total number of shoes.\n5. Jacob has 7 shoes, so Edward has 54 shoes left.\n6. Next, to find Brian's total number of pieces, multiply that by the given 3.\n7. Brian has 146 shoes, so Brian has 431 shoes in total.\n8. To find the total number of shoes in the group, we simply add them - they have 532 total shoes.\nInput: Cathy asked her roommate to take a few of her apples from the refrigerator, but then she was reminded it was her turn to do the grocery shopping.

Once the cheesecakes in the fridge are weighed, multiply the amount of cheesecakes remaining in the fridge by the desired shelf life of the cheesecake. Once you add the shelf life and divide it by the number of cheesesecakes sold minus the number of cheesese in the fridge, we are left with the number of cheese that you would have on the display for sale in the future.\n\nFirst, calculate the average weight per cheesecake. Second, multiply the calculated average weight with the remaining cheesecakes in fridge.\n\nOnce we add the shelf life, divided by the number of cheese left on display we have the number of days available for sale.", "answer": " 18"}

To get started with this question, we know that the given statement is about 'those who attend college'.\n3. This means that whatever 'those' is, they actually are or did attend. Hence, those who attend college, are not necessarily the ones who got a degree.\n4. Thus, 10 is not a valid answer because it is possible that none of those who attended college actually do end up getting a degree.\n5. In the question, we are told that those who actually get a degree are only 2 out of every 3 people who attend college, but nowhere is it actually stated that this applies only to 'those who attended college'.\n6. Also, we know the ratio of numbers between 24 and 27.\n7. In which case, we can eliminate 24 and 15, based on the information given in the question.\n8.

Choices: \nA: 2 B: 7 C: 25 D: 15 E: 70\nRationales:\n1. Bacteria that cause disease are called pathogens.\n2. Pathogenic bacteria present significant risks to the human body, but are not always harmful.\n3. The total number of bacteria in the human body is around 10 trillion.\n4. Around 100 trillion bacteria, mostly non-pathogenic, reside in a healthy human stomach.\n5. The number of pathogens in the human body is very small, less than 3,000.\n6. They can still cause serious diseases such as tetanus, whooping cough, typhoid fever, and syphilis.\n7. The total number of non-pathogenic and pathogenic bacteria is 100 trillon, of which 3000 are pathogens.\n8. So, out of 100 trilliion pathogens, 3,00 represents only 0.003%.\n9. This is equivalent to approximately 3,00,00,0,000,000 times 3,00.\n10. By the same calculation, there are 7,500,00 times 3000, pathogens present in a 10 trilliion population.\n11.

{"text": "The empty plane travels _______________ miles for each gallon.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question is a word problem that is asking for the total miles traveled by the plane for a 40-mile trip when it is fully loaded with people and luggage.\n2. The statement, `The empty plane needs 25 gallons of fuel per-mile`, can be translated to `The empty plane travels 400 miles per-gallon`.\n3. Therefore, we can eliminate option A, which has incorrect units as gallons don't equal gallons.\n4. From the initial statement we also know that the fuel needed by the jet increases by 2 gallons for every passenger added and 3 gallons for each piece of luggage added.\n5. Based on this information, the final total miles traveled would be based on the number of passengers and luggage along with their respective amounts of fuel.\n6. A quick algebraic conversion can be applied to represent `N` passengers and `L` luggage and convert to `v`.\n7. This gives us `v = 400 *(1 + 2 * N + 3 * L) for passengers` and `v = 445 *(1 + 10 + 20) = 445 + 96 = 541 miles` for luggage.\n8. The total miles in the statement is `541 + 445 +96 = 1082`, which can be calculated using the above equations.\n9. Therefore, the answer to the question is `F: 1082`.\n\nInput: Which color has the fewest unique names?

If each bucket contains two pounds of sand, how much sand do Eden, Mary, and Irris collect?\n\nOutput:The number of buckets each person carried is unknown, but Eden gathered 8 buckets, Mary gathered 10 buckets, and Iris gathered 5 buckets. That would total to 24 buckets. Since each container contains 2 pounds of weight, the total amount of sand is 48 pounds.\n\n### Solution:\nThe input statement states that Mary carried 3 more than Eden carried. If there were 8 buckets, then each bucket would weigh 2 pounds given the statement, so to complete the question, the number of buckets is necessary. If there were only 5 buckets, then Eden could have carry 2 buckets, Mary could have carry 6 buckets, and Ibis could have carried one (1) which would still exceed the total of the three. Therefore, you would multiply the total of the buckets together by 1. 8.  10 5= which does not equal 48 pounds, which is too much. So you would need 5 buckets, but 5 X 8 +10 =48 pounds. That is why it adds up to 48 pounds of sand.\nThe other way of stating it is, there should be ten buckets less than the two pounds of weight in one bucket, which leaves eight ponds in the end which would equal 16 pounds of sand.\nTo make the equation 25=48, you would have to multiply the equation by 2, then subtract 5.\n26-5=26=42\n\n### Assessment:\nThis solution is correct and meets the task requirement.

{"text": "The question gives, \"A sixty watt bulb uses 60 w...\". In this context, a watt is a unit of power.\nBulbs are things that do not produce electricity (light). They do consume it, so a bulb actually uses watts of power; in this case, we could interpret \"A 60 watt bulb uses... \" to mean 60 watt-hours of power; since 1 watt-hour = 1000 watts, it is then appropriate to write \"6,000 watt-h...\". Since 6000 watt = 6000 / 100 = 6 units of power per second we can call each \"of power\" an \"of power per second\" and so we can write that Allyn spends 240/0.066 = 3647.8 watts/second. The given cost of 20 cents per 60 watt = 20/60/ 60 = 0.0333, we would now know that Allyn spends ~3647 / 0.03 = 1215.33... dollars per month on electricity.\n\n### Input:\"I am a robot.

Also, we would need to write, \"I - as a machine - am a robot.\" The \"I\" is replaced by the \"machine\" and the \"As a machine I am...\" construct is changed to \"I am a robot.\", since then \"I\" no longer refers to \"a cat\" but to \"a robot\" (\"the robot\"), that is, we could write, \"I am the machine named...\" and then a name (e.g. \"Robot,\" \"Foxy,\" \"Nikita\").

Each monkey has at least 1 hand so would get 14 bananas from the first set of piles.\n4. The remaining 4 piles each with 12 monkeys would get only 9 bananas since each monkey has 12 hands.\n5.

So in order to calculate the number of liters is each can we need to subtract 10 from the total number of litres. Because 10 of the 24 cans each contain 8 litres of oil. So the total number of litre of oil in each remaining 14 cans that still have an unknown volume is.\n\nSo now the remainder of 14 cans contain 352 litres of oil in total.\n\nNow we just subtracted 10 from 290 to get the liters in each of our 14 cans. so each can contains 42 litres of oil.\n\nYou can verify this by dividing the total number of litters in all 24 remaining cans by the total number of non-8 liter cans\n\nwhich is 42.\n\n430/42 will give the number of litres in each can, where the answer is 10.\n\nA more efficient method is to calculate the percentage difference between 8 and each litre that is in the second portion.\n\nFor both the question mark and the question mark, divide 200 by 350 to obtain 3/5.\n\nThis can help you see how to correctly solve more complex math problems. \n\nIt also illustrates the fundamentals of the math problem and the steps that must be taken to come up with the answer.

{"text": "Her total income would be 260 +40 = 280, as her total income would be 500 for regular hours (28 hrs) and 20 per hour for her overtime (5 hours), which total to 620, so her total income including overtime pay would be 280 + 620 = 900.\n\n### Discussion:\nTo determine Irene's total income, we would need to account for her regular hours - 28 hours - and determine her overtime pay which is 1 hour (based on the overtime pay of $20).\nTherefore, her total income would be $500+$20+$280 = 285\n\nWe can arrive at this conclusion by first determining the regular hours worked - 28 hours.\n\nThen, we can deduce the total overtime hours, which in our case is 1 hour.\n\nWe can also use the information we received - 28 hours and 1 hour overtime.\n\nAs she got 20 extra for every overtime hour worked, we can simply determine the amount of overtime pay.\n\nUsing the information above, we'd have regular hours of 28 and the amount of overtime paid of 1.\n\nWe can then use this to determine the total amount of overtime paid by multiplying it by the overtime hour rate of $20.\n\nThus, getting $20 for each overtime hour worked, for a total payment of $20. Since Irene worked 50 overtime hours, the total amount of overpay would be 50 times $20, or $100.\n\nOur total income now would have increased by the total overtime income of $100 for a total amount of $280.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nA good resource to review your skills in mathematical analysis and mathematical expressions is Khan Academy: [Free Math Courses](https://www.khanacademy.org/math)\n\n## Related Pages", "answer": " 700"}

Since each pack of cards has 400 cards, if we get the first 400 cards from the pack, there's still 600 cards left.  That means there's 1/3 chance to get the 4 jokers.  But that doesn't cover for the fact all of the 30 packs contain the same amount of cards, so we end up with the probability:0.1/3*P(A) =0.133 P(A)\n3.This tells us that we need to get the probability of the given condition in proportion to the chances to get at least 1 joker.

{"text": "I would assume Serena took 4 days longer than Emery.\n\n### Reason:\nThe question is asking how long it would take the two to read the book.\n\nAssuming Emery can read five time as fast as Serena and considering that each person borrowed a copy, the problem can be reduced to finding the average number of days per copy of the book.\n\nThe time each person took to read the book can be found with the equation `SQ*5 = SQ`, indicating that `SQ = 20/(5)` with the symbol `SQ` representing the speed at which Emery reads.\n\nHence, the speed that emery reads is 20 / (5) which is equivalent to 4.\n\nFurthermore, since `SQ` represents the speed, `SQ*5` represents the speed that Emery could read 5 books of the same book and this would reduce the problem from two people to one person and then reduce the problem to `SQ = 4`.\n\nThe next step is adding Serena's contribution to the analysis to find out how much less time it would take Emery.\n\nThe time it would take Emry to read the same book would be `SQ*5`.\n\nSo Serena can make the equation `SQ = SQ*5`, such that it can be reduced to `SQ*5=SQ`, with `SQ` representing Serena's speed.\n\nSince the speed at which Serena reads is `4`, there should be a reduction of 5/4 for every book she borrows.\n\nThus, the total time it would take Serena to read one book is `( 4 - 5/4) / 5`.\n\nAdding the two times together with the original time given in the question, 20, the `SQ=4`, the `3` and the reduced time of `20 - 3*5 /4`, 5, one would see that the answer for the book is `( 4 + 20 - 3*( 5/4) ) /5`.\n\nPutting this in the fraction form and reducing by the 1 / 5, the answer is `201/5`.\n\n### Assumed solution\n\nSQ  =  SQ5 / 5", "answer": " 60"}

If four objects have the\nsame shape and six objects have the same shape, the only objects that share both the same shape and size with Bruce are in Bruce\u2019s set and have the same number as the objects in Mabel\u2019s set. How many objects are in each of their sets with each one of those objects being different from every other object in the set?\n\n### Rationale:This question is a combination question because we're looking at two statements to determine the correct answer. The first part is a set equation that consists of \"Bruce and Mable each have a set of things.\". The second statement is a conjunction with two disjunctions with the first disjunction containing 4 objects and the second disjunction containing 6 objects.\n\n### Response with explanation:The statement is, \"four objects have the same shape and six objects have 241 the same shape\". In order to determine the amount of objects, you have to determine 4 objects out of 164 and then find the rest of those in Mabel's set. So the first disjunction states, \"four objects have shaped 1 and the remaining object have shape 2.\" The second disjunction states, six objects have shape 1 and the remaining objects have shape 2. \"The only objects that share both shape1 and size with Bruce is in Bruce's set\". We can use the provided information to find out how many objects there are in every set.\nIn Bruce's set, there is still a shape 2 left to figure out. How do we figure it out? We use the provided statements. \"There are 164 objects, and objects with the same shape and size as Bruce, but with another shape, are included\". So now, the only objects that are left is shape 2 because shape 1 is taken out of the equation. In Mabel's set, there are 36 shape 2 objects. So now, we can subtract Bruce's set from Mabel's set (which is 36). This means Bruce's set", "answer": " 63"}

{"text": "83 buyers\n\n### Instructions:Answers the following question.\n\n## Detailed Analysis of Task Instructions\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes the task.\n\n`Input: A fertiliser is making a flower grow - what is likely to happen then?`\n\nThis instruction includes two sentences, the first one describes the concept of using a fertilizer to help grow flowers, and the second one asks the user to pick the correct answer that specifies what is likely to happen once the flower starts to grow. To correctly answer the instruction, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the meaning of the different terms and to identify the possible outcomes based on the provided evidence. Here are the relevant details in detail:\n\n`Input:John only gave a perfunory examination of the Corpse - though he did everything that was required of him.`\n\nThe instruction starts with two parts separated by a colon mark. The first part describes an examination that John performed on a corpse. The second part explains that John did all the required things to perform the examination, but he performed the examination in a perfunctory way. The word `perfunctory` in the second phrase is used to indicate that John's examination was not thorough or detailed. To solve this problem, it is essential to explain the difference between a perfunctory and a thorough examination. As per the Merriam-Webster definition, a perfunctory performance or action may not reflect much effort, attention, or thought. On the other hand `thorough` means to give (something) full attention or as far as possible to the necessary. So, `perfunctory examinations` do not provide full attention to detail and do not provide a thorough analysis of the evidence. To correctly answer this task, it would be more appropriate to choose `thorough`.\n\n`Input: Everyone has some sort of creative ability, it is the best way to express your creative self.`\n\nThe third instruction contains a similar sentence structure as the first two instructions, but this time, it mentions the concept of creativity rather than perfunctory examinences. The sentence starts by stating that \"Everyone has some sort of Creativity\" and continues by explaining how creativity can be used to \"express yourself\" rather than \"create art, write, or create ideas\".

Demonstration:If 10 children have a total of 7 books and their teacher brings 8 more books to the classroom, there are a total of 7 children with 8 and 8 books brought from the teacher, so 7+8=15.\n3. Thus, in the classroom, there will be a total of 15 books.\n4. Rationale: We can count by 7s starting with the 10 original books. Children have: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Teacher brings: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. There are a total of 10 children and 7 books each, 8 more being added to the classroom. When counting, each child who has 2 books will have 4 more, and each child who has 3 books will have 6 more, and so on until the one who has 10 books have 10 more books. So the total number of books in the classroom will now be 7 children with 10 books each, resulting in 70 books. The teacher will then be adding 8 more books, making the total number of books to 78. Now we have 70 and 78, we can count by 2s starting with the 7 children who have 10 books. 10, 12, (14 or 15, because there is no 13, so the two add to 26, and 15 is already 26), 16, 18 (or 19 because 19 is already 35, and 18 is already 36), 20, 22, 24, 26.

{"text": "### Demostration:\nFirst, observe that there's a coin flipping event and coin tossing event and a bunch of coins were tossed by three players into a pond.\n\n### Explication:\nWe may be a bit confused as to how to proceed with the question since there are a lot of events, and many factors. \nConsider the fact that at least 3 quarters have to come up along with 8 nickels and 60 pennis in order for Eric to be able to reach out and pull out a quarter out of the bottom of the wishing pond he dipped his hands into.\nConsidering this fact, it is safe to determine that each player have tossed exactly 1 of each coin. \nThis would mean that Eric have tossed a quarter, since he dips out a quarter. Cindy, the player who tossed dimes, has to contribute either 6 or 1 dimes. Ivy must have contributed 1 or 2 quarters, and Garrick must have tossed 1, 2 or 4 nickels.\nIf she has tossed 2 quarters, then we divide by two. If she has tossed 4 quarters, we divide by 2 again.\nIf she tossed 8 cents, we divide by 4. \nSince we have a coin tossing event, the event does not have memory. We have to treat each event in the same manner.\nIf the coin flipping event were the same, then we would have considered that the first coin could only be a nickel, but would also have been true for the next toss.\nWe can determine that Eric tossed a quarter. Cindys have tossed 3 quarters. Ivys have tossed at least 1 quarter \n\nNow we can determine a possible value:\n$$2q+6d+7n_{min}=17$$ $2$ of the quarters were tossed by Eric. Cindy will be responsible for 3 of the dimes. Garrick for 4 of the nickels.\nThen: $$2q+6d=17$$ \nThese are the values for quarters, dimes, and nickels. We have to set up another equation.\n$$4n_{min}=10$$ This is how many", "answer": " 200"}

{"text": "The two friends ran a total distance of 57 miles\n\n### Explanation:\nGiven the condition where one friend ran 8 miles more than the other one, we can deduce that the total number of miles run by the friends is the sum of the two individual runs plus 8. In other words, the 12 miles run by the first friend, combined with the 8 miles run over the 12, gives an additional 8 miles. Together, the sum of 8 and 12 represent 20 miles combined, which is the total distance the friends run together. This is exactly 57 miles.\n\n### Input:: What will the temperature be below absolute 0\u00b0C? Choices:  (The answer options are presented as a sequence: A, B, C, D, E).\n\n### Answer: Absolute zero.\n\n### Explanation:\nGiven only the statement that the temperature of an object will be below absolute zero, we can only state an estimate of the possible result. This is because the absolute temperature scale is based on the freezing point of water, and zero in water is the freezing point, not the absolute 0\u00b0C indicated above the zero on the temperature scale.\n\n### In other words, the temperature scale on which we measure temperature does not represent the absolute low that may be reached. What does it represent is the freezing point.\n\n### The temperature represented at 0\u00b0C is actually a temperature in between absolute zero and the actual freezing point of water.

{"text": "To determine the difference in price between Sara's stores, you must first convert both values from European currency values to US currency values. For example, if you use the value 950 for the first store, you will need to multiply this by 1.142 on the EUR to USD currency converter, resulting in a price of $1,039.91. For the second store, if you use the given value of 950, you will again multiply this by 1050 on the EUR to GBP currency converter, resulting in an answer of $918.60. Once you have the answers, to solve this question, subtract the two answers as follows: $918.50-$1,039 = -120.5 USD, the correct answer.\n\n#### Discussion:\n1. The provided statement is a comparison of two different prices of the same computer, $950 and \u20ac920, representing the prices respectively in US currency and European currency or otherwise known as the Euro, hence the use of EUR and USD.\n2. While this information is provided, the context of the question leaves the details out, thus, we are expected to know or determine the conversion rates from EUR/EUR.\n3. EUR has 1.14 conversions to USD, and USD has 1.15 conversions to GBP (Great British Pound or Pounds Sterling).\n4. So, if the 920 price from the first store was converted from EUR to USD, the rate of conversion would be 1.14 and the new price would be $1039.90.\n5. On a similar note, the 950 price from the second store in EUR could also be converted to 950x1.14 \u2248 $1022.21.\n6. Then, the conversion can be done to USD, using 1.15. This would yield an answer of 809.5 which would be equal to $920 after rounding the values to the closest two decimal places.\n7. Thus, the difference of the two values is $-120.50, as the given answer is -$120.\n8. This represents how much the", "answer": " 19"}

He saves $0.45, which is the cost of the new refrigerator, a day, a month, or $13.50.\n\n### Rationales:\n#### Kurt's old refridgerator cost $0.75 a day in electrictity.  Kurt recently bought an energy-efficient refridgerator that cost $0.4 per day in electricity.\nHence the difference in cost of the old and the new refridgerator are $0.35 per day.\nKurt is saving $0.35 a day with the new refridgator.  Kurt saves the $0.35 cost every day in one month, which is $0.35  \u00d7 30 =$10.50.\nKurt saves $10.50 a month in electricity through the usage of his new refridgater.\n\n#### The given month is 30 days.Thus, 30 \u00d7 $2.0 = $60.00.\nSince the new refrifderator costs $1.0 per day, hence to buy the new refrigerater one has to use $60/1$ = 60 dollars.\n\n### Input:$15 = $15 x $1 = 15$ \n\n#### The following expression is missing an additive sign or a subtraction sign or both.\n\n#### Rationales:\n\n##### $15 = $10 + $5$ \nThere is a missing sign of $+$ sign.There should be $+$ before $5$.\n$$(15)$$\nThere is a missing additive sign.

{"text": "Answer: 49\n\n### Demostration:\n1. This is a word problem that requires an understanding of fractions and division.\n2. The question gives an equation to find the total number of chocolate chips and vanilla chips together.\n3. Let 'a' be the number of chocolate chip and 'b' be the number of vanilla chips.\n4. The question states that Viviana has five more chips than Susana and Susana has 3 / 4 as many vanilla as Viviana.\n5. To find the total number of vanilla and chocolate chips together we have to find the total amount of chocolate chocolate chips as well as the total amount of vanilla chips that Viviana and Susana both have.\n6. Since Viviana has 2 more chips than Susanna, we can multiply Viviana's amount of chips by 3 / 5.\n7. This gives 6 vanilla chips more.\n8. This is because Viviana started with 5 chocolate chocochips and Susana with 2 vanilla chips. Since Viviana has more than Susana, she will have 3 / 5 more vanilla chips than Susana would have on her own.\n9. Now, we have to find the combined number of vanilla chocolate chips. First, to find the total number we need to multiply Viviana's chips by 3/5.\n10. This is equivalent to dividing Viviana's chocolate chip amount by 3 / 4.\n\n### Input\n\nSarah's sister likes hamburgers much more than Sarah does.

{"text": "Jake has the responsibility to sort and categorize the pieces of paper on the communal board according to the colour. From the information provided, we can deduce that he has to find five sets of red notes, each set has six notes, and then find twenty more blue notes scattered. Therefore, our first observation is 5 multiplied by 6 in order to obtain the number of red notes in each set and then multiply it by the number of notes in order to obtain the total quantity of each red note which is 30. Our second observation is to observe that there are two blue notes under each of these 30 red notes for the number of 60 blue notes. Therefore, the total quantity of each blue note is 30. According to these initial observations, our first equation is 30x1+30x2+...+30x5 = 600. The second equation is 5x6 + 2x6x 30 which equals 420. From these initial observations we are able to formulate a table. Each row represents a column of sets with each set having 6 items. The number of each column is the number of red notes which is six. The number two in the two columns is for the number of blue notes which is 2. The first row is the sum of each column since each column is the same, hence it represents each total of 6 items.

{"text": "- $62.60.\n\n### Rationale:\n- First, divide 20% by 1 to get the reduced rate of 0.2.\n- Multiply the rate by the second number to get the discount value in that particular set.\n- Subtract discount values to the original price to get the discounted price of the first set.\n- Secondly, the guest bathroom set has 4 towels, thus the discounted price is 4x($.40) + $40, or $64.\n- Next for the master set, divide the discount rate by 2 to get 0.1.\n- We can take another reduction of 10% on the already discounted price.\n- So, the total reduced price = ($20.50 + $40)/2 + $10, or $57.25.\n- Finally, add the two price values to get the total.\n\n\n### Input:\"Do you know the song 'He\u2019s so fine?'

{"text": "The question poses two parts: (1) running a mile in 15 minutes and (2) watching two movies, which is an average length of 3 hours.\n\nTo calculate the miles Paul ran during his 12-minute activity, one of the two movies should be taken, and the length of the movie should be converted to its running time.\n\nGiven the information in the question, the average length is used, which implies that two movies could be an average.\n\nAssuming there are 4.2 movies in an hour, the total running time of the movies is 8.4 hours. Each movie is 2.7 hours, and the average movie is 2 hours and 36 minutes.\n\nUsing the answer, divide 12 minutes by 5:30 minutes of the movie (2:36), which equals 2.28 movies.\n\nThus, Paul ran an average of 2.28 times during his 12 minutes running, which totals to 28.1 miles.\n\n### Detailed solution: \nThe following approach is provided to help you understand how to solve this problem and how you could have evaluated the different options.\n\n1. The question indicates that Paul runs a mile in 13 minutes, or 2:15 minutes. This means that a movie lasting 2:30 minutes should complete three miles.\n2.

In the third round, Jeff skift the sam number of times as Sam. In the fourth round, Jeff skift half as many times as Sam.\n2. Now, we can calculate how many times does each of them skipped in each round, to make all calculations easier.\n3. In the first round: (1+1+1=3)(1+1+1+1)=1+3=4.\n4.

The teacher did not know that the student has a deadline tomorrow. What should she do? Choices: A: Tell the student when to come next B: Stop telling the student C: Let the student come tomorrow D: Tell her to do the assignment\nRationales:\n1. Looking at the provided statements, the teacher is already working with the student, and the student has already left.\n2. The option D: Tell her to finish the assignment, seems to be the appropriate response.\n3. This is because though the teacher may be telling the student to come, it is not the teacher's place to tell the student to do a task.\n4.

Choices:  Option A: 7.9 pounds (pounds)  Option B: 8.0 pounds Option C: 8.1 pounds(pounds) Option D: not enough  Option E: more than enough\nRationales:\n1. First observe the context. It says the amount on the left is $20, which is the money that has to be spent.\n2. We also need to buy 8 pounds of potatoes for 7.80$\n3. So the next step is to calculate the money left after buying potatoes.\n4. The answer choices show that the potato costs $0.96.\n5. We can now calculate the amount left, multiplying the money left with $0.96 gives us $1.92.\n6. If we divide $1.92 (money left) by $0.96 (price of potatoes), we get $2.\n7. Hence, the answer is B: 8.

{"text": "- This case is a classic math problem dealing with the multiplication of fractions.\n- The first step in solving such problems is recognizing that multiplication of fractions is actually division.\n- Divide both numerator by both denominator in order to get a common denominator.\n- Thus, in this context, to wash n number of towels, we should divide the 14 into n; 14 divided by 7 = 2.\n- So the number of loads needed would be n * 2.\n- 3 * 2 = 6 loads of laundry.\n\n### Input :An engineer wants to reduce noise, which is measured on a 0 to 1 scale, at a railroad station. The noise is being polluted at the rate of 0.05 dB every hour. The railroad station is 200 meters from a highway that is at a maximum 300 meters long. How many months of noise should to be reduced to be removed?\n\n### Solution: First, we should recognize that the noise is being measured on a 0-to-1 scale but polluted at a rate of 0.1 dB per hour.\n- Since we have an hour, the per-hour pollution rate equals to 0.1 d\n- The rate of noise pollution equals to 0.05d per hour\n- Increase of 1 d is 10 times of 0.1\n- Hence, 1000 per week = 0.001 d more\n- Hence, 25 million years of noise is created by an extra 0.101 more d. or 0.01", "answer": " 6"}

The question states that a cut will happen \"before October 1st\" so that means 9 months prior. 3. Since March 30th and September 25th are included in the options, we can eliminate these two dates. 4. This is because the end of March and September is September 30th. If there is a cut, it will not be decided before the month ends unless it happens on March 31st or September 31st in the question. 5. Looking at the other two dates. 1) There is no April 1st so option D can be eliminated. 2) The sentence after the question says \"before October 1, the government will announce its budget plans for next year\" 6. The government is cutting its budget so by the end of March there will not be enough funds. If the cut happened on April 1st then most people are not working on a holiday so that would not be logical either. 7. The question states that if the cut happens before October 1st, they budget would most likely be announced on the month of its cut.

The steps to follow are:\n1. Select the variable and write its symbol.\n2. Write an equation using the given information.\n3. Calculate the given values and substitute to see if the answer matches.\n4. If an exact match occurs, we have our answer.\n\n### The given information is:\nP + Q = 10 (where P and Q are the variables)\nP = 4 (given)\nQ = 7 (substitute for P)\n\n### So, the equation becomes:\n7 + 10 = 10 (substituted)\n\n### I can get 7+10-10 = (7+7)-(7+0) = 7-7 = 0.  If you subtract the exact quantity of inches, you know immediately that the answer is 10 - 4 plus 7 plus 7 or 0\nSo, 10 - 10 = 7(63cm+63cm) - 7(63 cm) = 63 cm + 63 cm - 46 cm = (127 cm / 63 cm or 20 inches) - 8 inches = 10 inches", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "60 toys\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following question by choosing an option.\n\n### Option A: He didn't realize it would be so hard to get it working.\n\n### Answer A: \n\n1. A person has to have some sort of realization that the process of completing a task is going to be both difficult and tiresome.  Without such a realization, one would not recognize the need for the process of completing the task in order to achieve their goal.  It would not make much sense for a person to start on a project without realizing that it is going to require some effort on their part.\n2. The statement that \"He didn't realize it\" means in this case that the person was not aware of the magnitude of the difficulties that they were going to face when trying to get the task done.\n3. It is difficult to imagine that a person would undertake a task without being aware of its difficulties.\n4. It is not hard to notice that there is a flaw in the reasoning of the person. If they did not realize it was going to be hard, they were not aware of the difficulties they were going to face, meaning that they did not have a realization of what was to come.\n\n### Question:What is the realization of the individual?\n\n### Answer B: He didn't have the right software to handle this type of project.\n\n### Response B:\n\n1. The phrase \"the realization of the individual\" refers to the fact that a person is thinking through or contemplating the steps involved in a project or task.\n2. The phrase also conveys the notion that a person is considering what is needed in order to complete the task and what they can do to carry it.\n3. A person does not need to have an idea of what it will be like in the end in order to complete a project.  It would be necessary for a person to think through and consider their options before starting and being able to carry out a project or a task.\n4. A person does not necessarily know what the outcome of a project will be.  A person does not have to know the exact steps that need to be taken in order to be able to complete a project.\n5.

{"text": "45\n\n### Details: The reported number of people taking wine and soda doesn't account for those who would only take one or the other. Thus, we must add the people who took only wine, plus the people who took only soda, plus people who took both. This gives us 26 + (22 + 17) = 65, which is then added back to the original number of people, giving us 45. If this is not what you expected (the final answer being 21), note that each person is assigned a value based on whether they take both, one, and none of the drinks.\n\n### Details - Answer Verification: For the above question, each of the three answers is 21. This is because the number of people at the gathering equals 45, where as we expect it to equal 41, since the individuals taking soda and wine were added to the calculation. However, this problem has a trick in which 45 is a \"correct\" answer. It's a trick because each person is assigned a zero value when only taking one or none of the drinks, and therefore the question asks the quantity of zeros. For example, if everyone drank, then 26 would take one, 22 would take one, and 17 would take two (one each for each drink). This would make 45 equal the sum of zeros, namely 21+0+16.\n\n### Input & Ratiation:What is one of the easiest way to use the internet?\n\n### Demonsrtion:\nInput: A: through social media  B: searching and browsing  C: web browsing  D: web searches  E: surfing the internet \nRationales:\n1.

Similarly, reading and understanding something may be considered faster when comparing it to a video, where the reader has to read through it and attempt to understand it.\n3.

This is then followed by reading the book, which can be considered as 'easy' but may not always be the case as the book may have technical or hard to understand terms or complex ideas.  As such, it's not easier to do.\n5. Reading also requires more attention, meaning that readers would have to focus throughout the reading process.\n6.

It is a Greek word that means 'the people'.\nDemos: Demosthenes was an ancient Greek orator and statesman who had a major influence on contemporary Greek politics.\nDemos: Demons does not refer to 'the people', but instead refers to a malevolent mythological creature that haunts people and brings them bad luck or negative circumstances.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe definition of 'demos' is \"the people, the public\", while 'demon' has multiple meanings that include \"evil spirit or devil\". It can also mean \"appearance, form\". There is no overlap between the two meanings, so they can be confidently distinguished.\n \n### Demonsters:\n#### Demonstrator:\n\n### Conclusions:\n1) Demonstration is the act of showing someone something to demonstrate it.\n2) Demonstrator is someone who demonstrates something to someone else.\n3) These two words have different meanings which make it easy to distinguish one from the other.\n\n### Components:\n> 11\n### Sub-Composer:\n#### Compo:\nAn example of a word being a composition is comos, which means \"something that is composed of two or more parts\".\n\n#### Composer:\nA composer is someone who creates something from parts, the act of putting", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "The gift cost $192.\n\n### Explanation: Given the following information: \n\n- Ten friends decide to get an an end-of-the year gift for their teacher.\n- Each split the cost of the present equally.\n- Four friends dropped out of the group.\n- Four remaining friends split the cost of the teacher's gift equally.\n- The present now costs $5 more for each friend.\n- The gift cost $8 more because the cost was split equally for the number of people who were in the group at first and not for the number of people in the group now.\n- The cost was $160.\n- Each friend is now responsible for $8 more to contribute to the gift.\n- Each friend gives $8 and one friend gives $160 for the rest of the gifts.\n- This means that the cost of the gifts is now $168.\n- Subtract $168 from $176 and the difference is $8 ($176 - $168).\n- Then, divide the difference of $8 by the number of people remaining ($2*8)/8 equals $1.25, so the remaining cost of the gift is $1.25*4, and the answer is $5.\n\n### Input - Answer: The number of letters that can be formed by the letters in \"WITHSTAND\" is 75.\n\n## Instructions\n\nWrite and submit a Ruby script to respond to the task(s).\n\n\n## Scripting Notes\nConsider the input as a collection of tasks.\n\n* Use the standard \"to_i\" function for the integer input type with no leading zeros.\n\n### How to Format the Input\n\n* Include the task and all the data that are being given, or will be extracted from the input.\n\n### Your Responses\n\nRepeat the following task response, for each of the task/s\n\n* Add the first line to indicate the number of task(s).\n* Follow this with one script per task, noting that each script must respond to a single task.\n\n* After you\u2019ve included your script, include a brief note, describing your algorithms logic.\n* Your script should only use the given data (and no additional data).\n\n### How", "answer": " 120"}

{"text": "To begin, we must first note that 15 dollars is the price of a single car wash.  \nSince Jim buys a package of car washes, this means he purchased 20 car wash packages.\nWe can determine this by noting the price per car wash is $0.75, or 15,000,000/20.\nSince 0.75, the amount paid for each car wash, is equal to 60% of the cost of 15 dollars, the amount paid for the 20 wash packages is given as 60% of 15.\nAs there are 20 packages, the amount paid is 60% of $15 multiplied by 20, or 60% of (15 x 20), or 15 x 21, or 315 dollars.\nThis is correct.\n\n### Input The only way to make a cake is by making muffins first.

{"text": "If 2 VIP tickers cost $100 and 3 regular tickers cost $50, wouldn't 5 VIP tickets cost $100?\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThis task has several mistakes that were introduced in the solution to this problem. Firstly, the word \"tickets\" appears twice in the problem statement but only in terms of cost as $500 / $150. Secondly, there are incorrect assumptions, such as \"2 vip tickers\", which should be spelt as \"two VIP tickers\" due to the inclusion of two tickets and not just one. Finally, the incorrect term \"5 VIP tickers\", which should instead be \"5 VIP tickets\" because they indicate there is 5 of the same ticket rather than a count of each type of ticket.\n\nThe question is asking Mrs. Wilsborugh how much money she has left after buying tickets. Instead, the author asked if $500 divided by two tickets leaves any money. Thus, the formula should be divided by 5 since Mrs. Wilsborough bought 2 VIP and 3 regular tickeths.\n<br>\n<p> <em>If two $50 tickets do not account for a total of $500 and instead only cost $500 / 2 tickets, there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the task provided.

The first option of 'fog' does provide a feasible explanation.\n2. However, weather events like 'dust' and 'heavy rain' can also create instances where the sun is partially or completely blocked from the person's view.\n3. Option 'wind' also has a validity factor, though only for clear and warm skies.\n4. Option 'clouds' does provide a feasibility, but the question's second option already has it covered.\n5. So, if the person has observed that the sun has disappeared, option 4, 'heavy rain' should not be disregarded immediately.\n6. The only choice option left is, 'clouds', but the probability is negligible since a cloudy day does not typically have the option of witnessing the sun or it might also be cloudy during the daytime, as clouds are known to cover the sun.\n7. This eliminates the probability of 'clouds' as the right option, and thus, the only choice that fits in this situation will be the sun being covered by dense fog, hence 'fog', is the correct answer.\n8.

We were given a bunch of values in the context of a math problem, like so: `Lance makes $9 an hour`.\n\n2. In order to answer the math problem above, we are going to take something apart, analyze it, and then put it back together, like so: `let x = 3*.9 = $2.70`.\n\n3. Once we have analyzed the problem apart and figured out our `x` by replacing the number `9` with the multiplication `9*.3 = 2.70`, we can put it back together and solve the problem like so: `2.70 + 9*(2.70) = 29.40`\n\n### Input:-9 = -10\n\n### Response:-9 =-18\n\n### Explain:The first thing we should notice is that this is an example of a _**Subtraction**_ problem so the formula for solving such a problem is `subtract subtractors (9 - (-9) = 18`. \n\n**Lessons Summary:**  1. Start by breaking down the instructions by recognizing the formula to solve subtraction formulas, `first subtract the minuend using that from the subtrahend`. 2. We have a minuend of 9 and a maxuend of -9, use the formula to subtract minuend from maxuend and get our answer of 18. 3. Recognize that this is an example involving subtraction math, use the `=-` sign to denote that the problem is an example of `subtraction`. 4. Use the `-` operator to find the difference of `18`, the subtrahend, and our minuend", "answer": " 63"}

When you buy or rent a house, you will pay for all services, repairs, and labor that will be included in the price. When you rent, you will pay the person renting you space what they charge per month based on their costs. B: It seems that we pay for the quality of work, but this isn't always. The people we pay for their services and work are usually in the service industry or working on something they do a lot. For example, a carpenter will charge $3,000 for constructing a $30,000 project. They use the same wood that's in your house to build a more expensive project than yours. This means that the carpenter does not work on projects that cost more than $30k per project every day. D: The value of a carpenter's work often increases with the quality of work, and we can often tell if they did a good job by looking at the price tag on a project.\n\n### Response 1:\nWe can pay more when an employee does well. That said, even if an industry has employees who charge low prices, it doesn't mean the quality of work must be low. This means that an employee might charge more for good quality work.

Therefore,\n(x 10, for team1)(10 x 2) pairs of shoes = 20 pairs of shoes, where x can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nB. Given that there are teams, the number of 3 sets of lace will be x (For team 1) + x (For team 2) + x (For the third team) + x (For Team 4).\n\nThen:\n(x x 2 + x x 2 + x 2) pairs = 40 pairs of shoes\n\n1. We determine the total number of pairs needed to be 30 pairs. \n2. Then we multiply 20 pairs (which is how many pairs each team gets in total) by 2, the number of pairs each member gets. \n\n1. Team A's two pairs = 40 members x 2 = 80 \n2. Team B's two pairs = (40 x 2), same for C,D, E.\nTotal number of 2 pairs for each team = 160 \n\n1.

When you look at this sentence for the first time, don't you think it is silly? Choices: A: yes B: no\nRationales:1. Looking at the word 'book', it can be identified as the noun form of 'book'.\n2. Then, when it's followed by '-book', we know that it is being used as an adjective.\n3. So, the above word can be considered as a noun/adjective/noun combination that could be understood as 'a book is a book'\n4. There are also the words 'a cookbook' and 'a textbook' that are nouns followed by '-book'.\n5. We can interpret them as 'a cookbook is a cooking book' and 'a text is a texting book'.\n6. There is one more combination, which is 'a book is a cookbook'.\n7. This would then be read as 'a book is the same as a cookbook' which doesn't make sense if we know that a book is different from a cookbook.\n8. This then leads us to 'a book is a textbook' so we can arrive at the following interpretation 'a book is a writing book'.\n9. So, there is the possibility of a logical error or ambiguity, given that the word 'book' is read both ways.\n10. Hence, the answer is B: No.\nAnswer: B: No\n\n### Input : A: yes B:no\nRationales 1. You know that a book can be a book, but what comes after 'and' in the sentence 'A book is a book?', which means you don't know what a book is.\n2.

The students will give their presentation first, and then they will be able to ask questions of the family member about their picture.  What presentations will be allowed? Choices:  Only slideshows A: only B: None C: Presentations that have at least one person in front of them D: anything that relates to the family member  Answer Choice: C\n\n### Rationale:  1. First, observe what Ms. Smith is planning for this event. She stated that the students have to bring in a picture of their family member and prepare a presentation of no more than 2-5 minutes to share with the family member. \n2. This event is open to the class for a 20 minute duration where the student is only allowed to present for roughly 5 minutes without any extension or modification to the event. Since the students have limited time before they give their presentation, the requirement for each student to bring in one picture and present a family member will affect the type of presentations that can take place. \n3. Slideshows are generally made to display the elements and context of a picture in digital formats through visual effects and transitions. However, this event does not allow students to bring in slideshows, which indicates that only presentations can occur. \n4. Presentations typically involve the students bringing in items that would help them present the information in an effective manner, which can include the family member, but are not limited to it.  \n\n### Input \nPaige bought some new sticker and wanted to share them to 3 her friends.

In order to apply the equation of S = P \u00d7 T (subtracting the cost of the Samsung from the price of the iPhone, divided by the time) and solve for T (time), we are going to have to reverse engineer our answer options from high to low, and eliminate the answer options that don't meet the specified criterion.\n8. If we start from the bottom, we can see it would take 48+6+2 weeks to get the answer.\n9. As we add more to the bottom (48+6+4+2), we can see it would still take 48+10+6+2, because adding more to the bottom has no effect on the result, we'll see this later also.\n10. So, we start with the most amount added, and see we need 48 weeks to earn the amount of money needed to purchase the phone.\n11. This leaves us with 40+6+2 weeks needed if only subtracting the Samsung price.\n12. So, we start solving the equation from the top with 400+600+100+200=2002.\n13. This means subtracting $800 from $2002=1202, and we only get 40 more weeks necessary to purchase the phone without earning more money.\n14. We don't have to stop here, we can try it with 400 more weeks to get the answer again, which should give us 402 more weeks.\n15. This is where we see that adding more to the bottom doesn't affect the answer.\n16. If we keep adding to the bottom after 402+we get 4192+402+4 for a total of 4266.\n17.

{"text": "The given information states that the perimeter of a square shaped piece of paper is *20 cm shorter* than the height of a *computer screen*.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle (e.g., a computer screen) is *four times* the height.

This can be represented as H / F = s / t and H / f= t / 4 or H * f= s * 4.\n\nThe length of the square paper is *four times* t and twice H, so l= 2(H * f)= 2( (H * 4) * 4) = 64 cm. \n\nHence, 20 cm (Perimeter of a square paper) - 2 (The height of a computer screen in cm ) = 8 (height of a computer screen in m)\n    20 cm - 4 (height of a computer paper)\n\n     64 cm\n    \nHence the height of the computer Screen must be 8 cm\n\n###Input: Which of the following can not be a possible color scheme for a new painting?\n\n###Response:\n\n\nInput: He got his new phone in the mail, then what?

{"text": "The trader made a total of $2120 in profit, after paying for her next shipment she ended up with $2860 she can use to run her business.\n\n### Clarification:Given the prompt, to find out how much money was raised, one could look at either side of the equation - the total profit, or the difference between the amount received from donations and the amount the trader already had. Using math, dividing $960 by 2, one can find that the first $232 was donated through the family, $430 through her friends, $10 through her sister, $13 through her brother and $5 through her father. Knowing the family and friend donations would have already surpassed her original $610 goal, the $50 from her father might have been to help her out a little, so the trader has to put in a personal contribution of $25 to help her raise her total amount of $610.

Considering this, the time taken to burn the three bags of coalse is:\n\n```\nt=6*t`+1\n```\n\nThe right side is the coefficient of the term 'b' and the left side is the constant term. Since the grill is burning for a certain time, one can neglect the coefficient.

So, the grill was run for less than 6 minutes.\n\n### Problem-solving task\nTo the problem in the example: The grill must have run on two of the three terms.

The following number is 11 stamps with a snowflake stamp.\n7. The total number of stamps is 11+99+10+11, which equals 120 stamps.\n8. We have to round the number to the nearest number. 120 is greater than 100 so the rounding is to 20. 120/2=60, and the last number should not be rounded, so the total should be.\n9. 58 is the total number of stamps.\n\n### Input:\"Those who do not remember their history are doomed to repeat it.\" The quotation's author made which claim?

Solution\n\nA. Lisa earned 3 times (3) as much as Jack. \nB. Lisa earned 3/2 as much as Tommy. \n\nII. Concept\n\n1. Calculating the amount Lisa earned would require us to determine the amount Jack earned. \n2. Lisa earned 3 as much as Jack. This means that \nJack earned 1 times as much as her. \n3. Jack earned 1/3 of what or how much Lisa earned. \n4. From step 2, Lisa earned 3 times. \n5. From step 2 again, Jack earned 1 times. \n6. Applying the 3 times,  we have the amount Jack earned to be (3 x 1) = 3. \n7. We can now use 4 and 2 to make a formula to calculate how much did Lisa earn. \n8. Formula: (3 times as much as x) minus 3 = (3 times ) minus 3 \n9. We can rewrite this as (3 x ) + 3 = 3x \n10. 3x =3 \n11. 3 x = 1\n12. Lisa earned $1 as much as Jack.  \n13. Lisa earned 3x. \n14.

Given the height and weight of an adult person, what is the best number of pairs of legs needed on my table? Choices: 5A: 3B: 6C: 8D: 9E: 12\nRationales:1. First, note that the question requires us to provide the best answer considering four adults and an 8-year-old as a table\u2019s users.\n2. Now, we can move on to identify the options that relate to the functional ability of the table.\n3. It is immediately clear that 12 legs are the most suitable choice because it is an even number.\n4. So, the options 3, 6, and 8 are not optimal, since they are not an even number of legs.\n5. Option A has three legs and is unlikely to be sufficient for the table in the question, since the number of people and their weights are known and the table has to be capable of supporting them, which means four legs without any wobbling.\n6. Option B only has two legs, and therefore it is not a viable option for achieving the question requirement.\n7. Option E can be discarded, too, as it is not sufficient for this purpose.\n8. By reasoning with the known values, we can conclude that the best option for the question is D: nine. An even number of legs can easily be combined to ensure their stability, which would otherwise be difficult due to the different combinations.

From the provided information, we can start by breaking the calculation down into two steps. The first step is to calculate how many rooms can fit the 30 students in rooms, i.e. the number of rooms each student can occupy. The second step is to find the number of rooms needed to fit all the students.\n\nAs there are 2 queen size bunks and 1 pullout couch in each room, and each student can occupy either a bunk or a couch, our total capacity is 30 students * 2 queen size bunk * 1 pullout cough which equals 60.\n\nThere are 10 rooms in the available rooms and at most, it can fit 50 students meaning we need three more rooms, hence the principal should book a total of 13 rooms to accommodate the number of students while providing them with privacy.\n\n### Input : A school principal is booked 10 rooms for a class of twenty students on a stay over field trip at a hotel that has one hundred and sixty rooms with each room having a king bed.

{"text": "Missy doubled the amount of change she put in the bank every year.  When she put $25 in the bank the first-year, she invested $50 the second year, $100 the third year, and $200 the fourth year.  Therefore, Missy put $25 in her bank the first year, $50 the second, $100 third year, and $450 the fourth year.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The second-year is double the first. Since money that Missy put in her bank was doubled in the first year, we can make the following statements:\n2. $25 was put into the bank in the first-year = $25.\n3. $50 was put into the bank the second-year = $100.\n4. $100 was put into the second-year = double the first-year =$200.\n5. $200 was put into Missy's bank the fourth-year = $200.\n6.

{"text": "First, it is important to note that Cary is responsible for designing an irrigationsystem for three farmers.  It is also important to note that each of these farmers has a different amount of acres dedicated to growing certain crops, with Farmer Bob's acres being the greatest in acreage. As a result, the amount of water used for each farm is also going to depend on the amount of acreage that is allocated.\n### Further Details: In order to design the irrigationsystem, Cary must take into consideration the amount of water that each farm uses and the amount of acreages that each farmer has. With that in mind, the following equation can be used to determine the amount of water that goes to each farm:\n\n(corn)xA\\( \\sum (corn)\\) + (cotton)\\( \\sum (cotton)\\) + (beans)\\( \\sum (beans)\\) = (total)xA\n\n### Rationale: The equation is simple; it just means that the amount of corn that a farmer has can be multiplied by the amount of corn each farmer uses and added to the amount of cotton each farmer uses and the amount of beans each farmer uses.\nThis equation can be solved by substituting the individual values.\n\n(corn)\\( \\sum (crop)\\), which is equal to \\( \\frac{\\Big ( \\frac{3}{3}\\Big )}{\\Big ( \\frac{1}{3}\\Big )}\\) = 1, can be rearranged to represent Corn as \\( \\frac{3x1}{x3}\\)\n\n(Cotton)\\(\\sum (Cotton)\\), which is equal \\( \\frac{\\Big (\\frac{9}{9}\\Big )}{\\Big (\\frac{6}{9}\\Big )} = \\frac{3}{2}\\), can be rearranged and represented as \\( \\frac{9x1/2}{1\\times 9}\\)\n\n(Beans)\\( \\sum (Beans)\\), which is equal \\(\\frac{\\Big ( 0.5\\Big )}{\\Big ( 0.33\\Big )}=1.67\\), can be rearrangsed as \\( \\frac{5}{2}\\)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\( \\frac{3x", "answer": " 36"}

{"text": "8\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Tom needs to lower a robe down 6 stories. One story is 15 feet. The only robe being sold is 8 meters long but you lose 15% when lashings them together. How many pieces of robe will he need to buy.\nRationales:1. We have the total number of stories and the units in which they are measured.\n2. We know the length of 1 story is 15 and the length(units) of 8 meters is 8.\n3. According to the statement, the robe to buy loses 15% while lashing them together, and we want to have the total number of pieces of robe. Losses are calculated by finding the difference between the original number and its remaining fraction.\n4.  To get the number of pieces in original number, we convert the units of 8 meters into 15 feet units and then we need to round the whole unit after subtracting a 15% value from the total number. For example, 15 feet of robe are needed when 100 feet are bought. (Round 100 feet as 100 feet = 150 inches which is the nearest 2 inch) so 15 pieces of robe are needed.\n5. Let x represent the length(units of 15 feet) of the robe Tom wishes to buy. According to the question statement, X*(1-15%)=x  where x is the number of pieces Tom will buy.\n6. It is clear that to get the number of pieces, we need to solve for the variable x by finding its value which is x= 16.6.\n7. It means Tom will need to buy 16.6 robes to cover the whole distance of 1 story = 15 feet.\n8. Finally, we need to add 1 to make it the nearest amount to find the total number of pieces from 16.6 to 17.\n9.

We already know Linda can easily pay for the other items and did, so that stuffed animal is the largest chunk.\n### Demonstiration: 1. We know the value of $40.\n2. The stuffed animal cost $15, because the change should have been $5.\n3. $15+1.5=16.50 and since.5 won't go on.5, she spent more than that on the stuffed animal.\n### Rationales: 1) We know she spent total of $25 and can find that the stuffed animal must be the one that cost greater than 25-16.50 = 8.50.\n2) Now we can subtract 15 from 25 and that means that 35 is left.

The length of a side in a square is given by the formula length = square root of area divided by 2 (or l = sq.rt(area)/2).\nThis formula, in turn, is a result of the Pythagorean Theorem, A2 + B2 = c2, where A = side length and c = hypotenuse (or diagonal). Putting these values in the formula, we get (((A/2) + (A/2)))2 = c2.\nNow as the formula for area of a square is given by A = s * s or (side length)2, replacing A with side length we get:\n(((side length) + (side length))2 = c2 OR: side length2 = ((", "answer": " 14"}

Therefore, it is important to convert both the amount of time spent on tasks in total and the amount of time spent cleaning Miriam's room into the same units.\n\n### Answer: In the first step of solving the problem, we can see that Miriam's total time spent on her tasks is two hours since her time on homework is 40 minutes and her total time spent on her time-consuming tasks was 1 hour and 10 minutes.\n\n### In the second step, to answer the question how long Miriam spent on cleaning her room, we multiply Miriam's hours spent on cleaning her home by 100 so that we can calculate the percentage in a better way.\n\n### Rationale: As we can see, Miriam's hourly homework time is not 111 minutes.

{"text": "Rose had 31/8 grams of rice left\n\n### Explanation:\nInput:\"She cooked 9/8 of the remaining in the morning and 3/4 of the remaining rice in the evening.\"\nThis statement is about Rice.\n\n### The input is divided into 2 sentences. The first sentence has a subject (cooking) with an action (9/10), then a direct object (1/4). The second sentence has a subject (rose) with an action (remaining rice) and a direct object (left).\n\n### Since rice is missing in the second sentence, in order to connect the two statements, the rice that remains must be given. In order to know which statement to put rice in, look at the actions performed. Rice is cooked in one of the statements, and remaining in the other. Therefore, the action cooking was performed on rice in the first statement, and the remaining in the second.\n\n### Since it is a question of division, it is not necessary that any of the variables are integers. Rose had 10 kilos of rice, and the following fraction of that was eaten:\n9/10 => 900/1000, which reduced to 3.6 kg.\n1/4 => 250/100, which reduced 4.6 kg. Rose now has 2.6 kg left.\n\n### Rationales\n\n### Input:\"The question is asking about how many grams Rose has left.\"\n\n### The question asks about the gram amount. Since the other options don't contain grams and Rose has 3.6 kg left, the answer will be less than a kilogram, and since Rose has 2.6kg left, the answer will also have a.6 to the left of it (since the answer needs to be less than a kilo).\n\n### Input:'Rose cooks', a subsection of the second sentence, the subject being Rose.\n\n### Input,\"9/8 of rice\",the direct object is the subject's, so it'll be the action \"Cooked and 3/8 of the remaining\".\n\n### Input, \"9/8\", the subject is the sentence's and direct object is the 3/8 so the answer is 3", "answer": " 750"}

In another 15 years, the population of earth is estimated to be at least 10 billion. So, on average, one person is born every seven and a half seconds. This is an average over the entire planet. In every country, many people are already wondering how they should raise that question, and even more are starting to worry about how to solve it. With so many people, it will become crowded in every region of this planet, and it is hard to imagine how the people on earth live or what they do. At the current rate of the birth of babies, it is calculated that that the population will be 300,000,00,00 people by 2080, that is three hundred million times the current population and much more than the whole population currently living on earth. So, what will be, and how will it happen? Will there be enough resources for everyone? If not, what will happen to the countries with less resources, or will they be taken over by other nations? There's plenty more to ask, but it seems impossible to ask or find a solution.\n### The first thing to say about the population of a planet is that although people can exist anywhere, different groups of people are more comfortable in some places than others, and the more comfortable they are, the more likely they will be to move and settle there.\n### Therefore, countries with abundance in water, vegetation, land resources, and other aspects may attract immigration to develop the country and make it prosperous as well as attract people to settle there.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question is about asking for the population of a planet, and the following paragraph explains in detail what it is about.\n2. The paragraph is structured in such a way that the first part provides a general context of the population increase, stating that there are currently seven billion people and that in another fifteen years", "answer": " 19"}

Emily and Megan swap marbles in a way that Emily gets double the number of marbles she currently has.\n3. Megan has 12 marbles after the number of marbles is doubled.\n4. Emily and Megans can then swap again, but this time Emily takes half of the 12 marbles that she didn\u2019t start with.\n5. There are no terms to subtract. Hence, Emily gets 6.\n6.

Activity 4 describes an event that could be associated with a stock market. Activity 5 is a plant. We can infer that a microphone boom should not be found in a concert or in a flower.

The three steps that Joey plans to follow are to mow 3 of his neighbor's lawns, sell 2 of his collectible figures to some friends and work at an hourly rate for a total of 8 hours.

The shop gives discount of 13%. Mrs. Smith, therefore, pays $56.66$.

There are 336 candy bar in a library and each day they have 10 more books left in the library. (A)\n\n2. This means that 124 books were taken out each day. (B)\n\n3. This represents a negative quantity of books that are in the library. (C)\n\n4. Also, 22 books were brought back each day. (B')\n\n5. This represents a positive integer, therefore it is a positive quantity of books and does not represent a negative quantity of books. (C')\n\n6. Therefore, 22 books represent an increase and 124 books represent a decrease. (D)\n\n7. Since a negative quantity is cancelled with another negative quantity, the net change in candy bars is 0, (zero) or nothing. (E)\n\n8.

He pays the full $30 price for 36 balls.  2 * Gus buys 9 balls at $3 per ball, leaving him with a cost of $27.  He takes 12 golf balls at no additional cost, which equals $0.  3 * Chris also takes 12 golf ball at no additional cost.  So Chris takes 12 golfballs at no cost for the fourth time, which equals $0, too.  4 * Gus pays $3 for the 9 golf balls he purchased and then he receives 12 for free, hence he pays $27 for 21 golf balls.  5 * Dan pays $30 for 24 golf balls that he received for free.  They have all paid the same amount per golf ball: $3 each, so their expense equals $108.  6 * Gus and Dan pay $36 and 24 which is less than Chris who paid 24 at $3 each, so Chris pays most.  7 * All four golf balls now have spent the same amount per golf balls, so they all pay the same, which is $156.

Explain your answer by expressing your reasoning as completely and clearly as possible.\n\n### Response (Option a)\n\n\nMy answers: \n\n1. First of all, I will assume A's to be the minimum amount of grade. So the minimum grades I can get in first semester are  75%*12+25%*(48-12). To get a A means you must have a 90%.

This can only mean one of three things:  team members didn't really want to work or work hard or what? Choices: A: nobody cared B: no one cared C: no one liked or followed through D: no one got along with the boss E: no one wanted to do the work or know the material\nRationales:\n1. The question begins by stating that everyone on the project worked hard, which suggests that nobody wanted to do the wrong tasks.\n2. Given that people are only expected to work hard not to be efficient or effective, the assumption can be made that everyone on the project only worked hard.\n3. Next, the fact that the project produced poor teamwork indicates that the only people who can be to blame are the ones who did the project - team members or the people on the project.\n4. This further reinforces the fact that the people who took the project couldn't be the cause of the poor teamwork - they were only doing what they were supposed to and the fact that they worked hard.\n5. This leaves us with the three possible options provided on the question.\n6. The only scenario that can explain that despite the people working hard, poor teamwork is produced is A: a scenario where team members don't really want to do the work or the know the material.\n7. This means that the team members didn't like the project or the task, or they didn't care to work hard and learn the skills required to do the project efficiently.\n8. According to the context of the question and the answers given, it doesn't make sense that the cause of poor teamwork is due to a lack of commitment or inefficient work - the project was done inefficiently only because it was done hard.\n9. Alternatively, it would be illogical to assume that the team members didn\u2019t know how to do the tasks needed to do the project - everyone does the work they were qualified for and trained to do effectively.\n10.

The question provides us with the information needed to solve for this problem.\n1. We know Bianca worked for 2 hours shorter than Celeste and double the amount of time that Bianca worked.

We can use this information to eliminate an entire variable at a time. As Celeste would know the amount of hours McClain worked, we can plug that amount of hours into the equation:\n   ```\nCeleste + (1/2 x * Bianca) + **(4 * Bianca)**\n    ->  Celeste + (1/4 x * Bianca)\n   ```\nThe next step is multiplying the whole equation by 60, which is 1 hour.\n   ```\nC + 15(1/4 x Bianca) = Celeste + 15(2/4x Bianca)\n   -> Celeste + 1/2 x 5x Bianca = Celeste + (10x Bianca)\n    -> 270x Bianca = 270x Celeste\n    -> Celeste = 1/32 x Bianca\n  ```\nTaking away Biancas number 11 from that value, we have:\n   ```\n    (1/32 x 11) - (1/32) = 4.761875\n```\nWe can then plug the other answers into the equation.

Hence, the box's height is 12/4 = 3 inches.\n\nWe also know that there are 10 blocks of the same size, and using height we found that each block is 10 blocks of length, so we can compare this against our previously calculated height.\n\nHence, the formula used is to use the height of the building block and multiply by 10, this will then produce a value that matches our calculated height of the box.\n\nNow we know that the height of the building blocks equals 24/3 = 8, this means that we add the blocks by the total number of building blocks, so 8 times 10.", "answer": " 40"}

We know first that the second computer was purchased on the basis of a price range of what was described on the first computer. So, the second computer is obviously higher in price than that of the first computer. Given that both computers were purchased on the same day, the user must have had enough money to have afforded both computers. Thus, the amount paid for the first computer would never be higher than the amount paid for the second computer. This is because the user would not have had a purchase the second as they could not have afforded it. Therefore, the most likely price range the user has is what was originally paid for the first computer.\n\n### Input`What is the weight of 2 lbs to the nearest fourth pound?`\n\n## Response: `6 2/4 lb`\n\n## Rationales: As the question itself is confusing, the following is a breakdown of the numbers of the question to form a correct computation of the answer to the original question.

{"text": "$20\n\n### Incorrect Answer:  $22\n\n### Demanded Answer: $17:\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThis question tests the applicants understanding of the word 'left-of'. First note that the sentence has 'Left-of' in bold. This tells us that the correct answer cannot include the word 'left'. That alone makes a few of the answer choices inaccurate.\n\nNow consider the structure of the question. There is a dollar amount with a dollar sign in front of it. Since we aren't given the word 'left' of, we can assume that the dollar signs will include all numbers to the right.\n\nSo, we can now focus on the word 'left'. The question is asking how much money Scarlet has left. And there are only two options: 'left of' and 'left of'. The most common sense answer is 'left of'. But it's incorrect because it includes the word 'left'. So all options without 'left' are correct answers.\n\nNow we add numbers to each option. Since the question is asking how much less was left, it must be how much more the other option had. By subtracting the given option from the other options we get the answer; The person left more. Thus, the answer has to be an integer larger than or equal to (-$23 + $48). But note that we aren't told what the options are, only that some are integers. Thus, the answer can only be (10) if we add the two numbers in a pair. The pairs are (-$23, $22) and ($23, $21). But we already can see that only the latter pairs answer can be an integer. That means the correct answer option is B.\n\n### Correct Answer:  $20:\n\n### Demostration:\n\nThe rationale is the same as above. The only difference is that there is no word 'left-of', so we have to consider the context of the question before subtracting. Now consider any integer $>$0. Since the question doesn't ask for the difference between an integer and a money amount with a dollar symbol, it can be anything within the integer range. In other words, an integer which falls into this range is considered a correct answer. Thus, in this case, if", "answer": " 9"}

That means he has 26 pieces and Stan has 13 pieces.\nThen I will add Tabitha's 22 pieces to the mix and then finally I will add Julie's  half pieces of candy as well.\nIf I add all of that together using all of the pieces I am left with 39 pieces of candy in total.\n\n### Input\nTabitha and her friend's found that two different apples were more expensive than one other.  One is the more expensive of the two with an average price of $18.69 and the other is with an average price of 5.99.  What is the highest total price that could be paid for the 2 apples with at most a difference of $6.84 between the two?  So the two prices will be the most expensive difference so we do not go over 6.84 total.\n\n## Demonstration\nThe apples could have just as easily been two apples with a price difference of $8 between the two of them, instead of them having to be the first of the two apples costing $18.6 and the second costing $5.99. If we were to choose $8 as our two different apples with a price between them, we would be able to use this algorithm for this question:\n\nFirstly, if we were to subtract the $18.6 from the $5.9 we would have $2.71.  If we then subtract all of that from the $8. We would only have 1.31 cents left over. So we would have a difference of only a couple cents for the 2 different apples which would have a price difference of $6.90.  We cannot be over the $6.90 so the apples would then be $2.98 apart.

{"text": "James paid $12.36\n### D. Explanation:\nTo determine the amount of the gratuity, we first multiply half of the total bill with 20% = 20% of $16 which is $3.20.\nThe total bill $19.20 which includes $3.20 of gratuity.\nNow we subtract $3.20 from total bill - $19.2 - $3.2 = $15.80\nThe gratuity of $3.20 means the amount of total bill left is $12.90.\nTo confirm the answer, we then divide the value of gratuity by half to arrive at the amount of the gration.\nThe amount left after tax is $15.8 divided by half which gives the amount of the grution $3.9 or $3.90.\nThe amount of bill left to the customer is $12.8 which is an extra amount of $3.80.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\nSo, to answer the question, divide the bill in half: $28.00 (a $17.00 portion + $11.00). That $17.0\nIn total, we need to get to $11.90 (total left after tax) / $7.95 (divide by half).\n\nStep 0 is just basic math.\n\nStep 1: To get to the $11.9 portion after tax (taxes are already figured out) is $7.95 / 2 = $3.975 (so $28 - 17 is just 11).\nStep 2: You now know you took away $11.9 minus the $3.97 from Step 1. This leaves you with $8 (so $3.97 * 2 is $7.94 that's $11 - $7.94)\nStep 3: $8 / 2 = $4. This is the $8 from the previous step divided by two. Now the $8 you took away from the $11 from your Step 1, $11 - $3.97 is $7.93 ($7.95 - $0.52", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": "45 students can be accommodated, since 30 desks have been assigned to each room with 15 classrooms, which means there would be 15 x 30 = 450 desks available overall, and each room would have at least 3 desks left for students to sit on, because 450 is an even number and so it would be divided by 3 to get a nice number. Since only one student can sit at each desk, we can subtract 30 desks from the original number of 450 to get 420 available seats. We then take that number and divide by 8, which equals 52.5 then we would round up to the next whole number and we can say that there are 53 seats left in the room. In order to guarantee that every student gets to sit on their own desk, the final number that needs to be accounted for is subtract 53 from 420, because 420 is the number of desks that would be shared, thus yielding an answer of 363.5 or 364 as the final and total number of students this school can accommodate.\n\n### Input1:In the event that this company is unable to find a way to recover from the effects of an economic recession, the company will go through what process?

The question details the length between the broken flagpole and the ground using the symbol \ud835\udc02\u2032\u2032\u2032, a notation that indicates the distance from the tip of the flag pole, so there must be two feet above the tip of the flag to the ground.\n\nWe also note that the flagpole is 15 feet long minus the tip, hence, the broken flagpole represents 12 feet, or 12 feet minus half of the top, which is 5 feet.\n\nFollowed by, the statement that the flagpole broke in half, which means that the length between the base of the flagpole and the ground was cut in half. For example, if the flagpole was 10 feet high before breaking, the flagpole will now be broken into two parts: the half that was dangling and the part that was still on the ground.\n\nSince we have the measurement of the dangling part, it is relatively straightforward to calculate the amount of the flagpole that was still on the pole itself. If a flag pole that is 10 feet above the ground is 5 feet below the ground, the flagpole measures, we can say that the other 10 feet of the flagpole is actually 5 feet of flagpole and the rest is above the ground.\n\nIn other words, if the flagpole were to be divided into two parts, the top would be 12 feet tall (\ud835\udc02) and the half that was draping off would be 5 feet tall.\n\nRearranging and simplifying, the length of the broken flagpole (12 feet minus the hanging 5 feet) is 7 feet, which means the length of the flagpole broke at 7 feet, or 5 feet above the ground.\nTherefore, the answer is 5 feet, which can be represented by 5 ft.\n\nInput: After his injury, the player had to sit out the season.

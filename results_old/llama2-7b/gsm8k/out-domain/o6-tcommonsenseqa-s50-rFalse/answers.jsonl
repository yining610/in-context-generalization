{"text": "A: 101,977\n\n### Explanation:\n\n\nInput: When solving a 3x3 Rubik's cube, you need to apply the same amount of moves to each side of the cube. The algorithm is described on the wiki which states that you need about 27 moves to solve a 3x3 cube.\n\nIn Rubik's cube notation, the moves are represented by the notation \"Q1\" and \"Q2\" which stands for quarter turn (1/4 a full turn).\n\nIn the above input example, R(5, 6) represents a rotation of 1 turn clockwise on faces D and F and a 3/4 turn clockwise on faces A and B.\n\nIn the above example, since the moves are the same on each side of the cube, we can make a set of all the moves. Then, we must determine if we can rotate each face such that only one unique solution would match these moves. I did this by using a string map to store the different moves of each face and comparing these values to make sure the values of each face would be different.\n\nInput: I think I should have used a map from string to values instead of string to set of tuples containing values.", "answer": " 12834"}

{"text": "Libby used 84 bricks of snow. I used logical arguments and diagrams in arriving at my answer.  To arrive at the answer a total of 84 bricks were used in creating the igloo.

In total the number of bricks left were used to make the top part since the number of bricks used for the bottom part was more than enough. If a part of the iglo was made with more bricks of snow would be used to make the top half of the 84 8 bricks were used to make the igloo. Therefore at the end of the day Libby used 81 to make the remaining bricks, using the same method the bottom half of the iglos required 14 bricks of snow, I made sure that I added that amount of bricks to make the top half and therefore I was left with 81 bricks of snow.

{"text": "Answer Question: Which type of instrument would you expect to find in a school band?\n\n### Explain:\nThe question asks how many songs the musical group will play in the 3rd and 4th set of their performance. After stating that they will play 5 songs in their 1st and 7 songs in their 2nd set, I have to assume they will play 2 songs when they are finished performing to get an average. Then I solve for the average, which was (5)+7=(?)+2, 13, the average of 2 songs in each set if the band averages. Which type of instrument would be found in a school band? We have 90 students between both the clarinet section and the flute section of the band. For all of the students in the band, 80% play the flute and 20% play the clarinet. Assuming that all of the students in both sections play an average of 2 songs, how many songs will the band play in the third set?

{"text": "Robi ney can fill the tuba in 180 minutes.\n\n### Explanation:Robin Ney is filling a tub where the flow rate from the tap is 10 liters per minute. The flow is the amount of water in the tub that is moving. The height of the water in the tub is 0 at every time step.The flow rate for the tub is 10 litres per minute. The maximum flow rate is 10 litre per minute. The flow capacity is 12 litres per minute. At any given time 12 litres is the maximum flow rate and 0 is the overflow point. So the total flow rate is the maximum flow rate minus the overflow rate. That means that there is negative flow at the overflow point at every time. So the flow rate is not the flow capacity but the sum of the flow and the overflow rate at the overflow point for every moment. The flow rate for the overflow point is 0 +0 = 0. So at every moment the flow rate is 0 which means that the amount of water left in the tub in flowing out the overflow pipe and is not added to the current total water in the tub at that time. After 1 minute the flow capacity is the remaining water in the tub. The maximum flow rate after 1 minute is 12 litre per minute. So we know the flow capacity is 112 litres and the overflow rate is 0. After a hour the flow capacity is the amount of water left after an hour. The amount of water after an hour is 10 litles. So the flow capacity for an hour is 110 liters.The overflow rate for an hour is 0. So the flow after an hour is 0 +0=0.After 10 hours the overflow rate is still 0 and the flow capacity is 770 litres. The flow rate is still 0 for 10 hours. At 22 hours the overflow rate is 760.\n\n### Bonus:\n\nInput: When a car crashes in the road, a broken glass forms and the car is destroyed.

The first step is to know that the total balance of $1 or $3,454 is split evenly to yield a result of $3,453 which should make some sense, as there is a quarter of a whole. Then we are asked to add the two accounts together which yields the result of $9,980.19\n\n### Response 2:\n\nSolving this question one needs to determine what is given and what is asked.   The question states that Gina currently has accounts with a total balance of $3,478.52, so what is asked is the combined balance of the two accounts. We know that each account is 1/4 of the total balance, however we do not know how to calculate what 1/4 of $3,485 really is.  Lets multiply 4 (since there are 2 accounts) by 1/4 which is 1/2.  then the balance becomes $3,460.20. Lets add this to the other balance to determine the new balance of the combined account, which is $7,338.72.", "answer": " 1728"}

{"text": "We have 22 sheep left in the pen and we can write this as 0.20 x 81 = 16.2\n\n### Instructor comment:Correct! This problem would be more challenging for a learner who lacks mathematical content. Here we've already done the hard thinking to solve this equation, and provide you with a quick and accessible answer. Let's take a look at how we might tackle this situation where the learner does not have much mathematical content and would really struggle to solve this.\n\n### If we had not done the work here, the learner would have had to come up with the equation to solve for 16.2, which might have helped the learner understand what would happen next.\n\nNow, let's apply the knowledge that the shepherd rounded up 90%, and there are 81 out in the hills. We'll just use this knowledge and say that 90% of 81 is 72.9 and we'll have 30 more sheep in the pen. This doesn't seem right, so we'll need to put one of those numbers somewhere else. And we won't need to do the hard math anymore to solve the equation.\n\n#### Instructor comment:This is a challenge that I face as an instructor. The learner doesn't have deep conceptual knowledge in my domain (math), so we really have to help them through the steps. But in this situation, I don't want to be so obvious that I solve the problem for them. We want to build a scaffolded process that would allow the learner to eventually reach a solution without the teacher as a crutch. And sometimes that means working backwards in a way we never do in our math classrooms. At least not until college, but that's another story.\n\nNow, why would this particular equation give us the solution of 16.2?\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following grade 1 math expression.\n\n### Input : 5 minus 3\n\n### Response : 2\n\n### Input 0.9\n\n### Response 1", "answer": " 9"}

With an understanding of the instructions, it can do this. Next, it needs to read the sentence \"from\" as the start of a number and the word \"all\" because these words indicate that a number is expected. The computer recognizes \"18\" and \"7\" because it knows that these words represent numbers. Then it learns to understand \"that have\" as \"that have,\" which it recognizes to mean \"the tomatoes\" and that word \"each\" as \"each.\" Finally, it knows words like \"state\" and \"pupils\" indicate teaching, so it knows that the sentence refers to tomatoes' growth. It learns to recognize words like \"if\" and \"dry\" as verbs.\n\n### References\n[Source for math example](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-xOcHgjz2O0C&pg=PT3&dq=what+do+you+wear+at+bridge+of+your+nose%3F&hl=en&ei=qR6xU9O8PMH1_APBwYDgCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&sqi=2&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false)", "answer": " 42"}

{"text": "Write a block of Python code that will count how many cards John is left with.\n\n### Expected Results:\nThe output for each input must be shown.\n\n### Notes:\n\n* The input is a list of tuples that contains: (Number of partial deck, Number of full deck, Quality of card, Thrown out Card). Each tuple must be sorted by ascending order of the second value. The quality refers to how high the cards are. Example of a quality value:\n>  A>K>Q>J>10>9>8>7>6\n\n* Thrown out Card refers to the number of cards that are considered bad. They can either be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Every input will include the number of cards that were thrown out.\n\n### Clarification:\n\nThere should be a number followed by a string \"Quality\" in the list of tuples. I want the code to have the ability to add these items to the original input. The original input should stay the same as it is. The code should not add any additional items itself.\n\n### Code Challenge:\n\nIf the quality of the card is a letter (A, K, Q, etc) I want two of those letters followed by a value between 10 to 6 followed by a string of \"1\". If the quality is a number, any string can go in those locations. Example: High quality, Ace of Spades is H, but a low quality Spade is A.\n\nThe strings should be capitalized. I want the capital letter followed by a string of 1. I want to use the order above, regardless if the quality of the card I specify is a letter or number.\n\n### Example Input:\n\nInput 1:\n> [('Three decks', 'one full deck', 'A'), ('One deck', '3', '1')]\n\nOutput 1:\n338 cards\n\nNote: There is now 3, count the quantity card and add the number in brackets next to it.\n\nInput 2:\n> [('1 deck', 'full', '6'), ('3 decks', 'one', '2')]\n\nOutput2:\n1202 cards\n\nNote: Again add the number in brackets, count the quantity card, and add", "answer": " 200"}

How much will it cost to charge the battery on your phone completely for the first time? The charger has a power rating of 6 amps and the phone needs 12 amps to fully charge. What is your total cost?\n\n### Demostration:\nYou have a phone with a power rating of 12 amps. You have a chargger with a power rating of \"n\" - 0.50. You want to use exactly enough power to charge the phone. Your charger does not provide as much power as the phone needs.  Your total power rating is 0.50 x 12 = 6 amps.\nYour total cost is the cost to charge the phone for a certain amount of hours at 6 amps x the hours that the phone is charging. 12 amps are needed to charge the phone completely. So, you will need to charge for 12 hours to fully charge it. If the battery is $10 then, 12 h \u00d7 12 amps \u00d7 10 cents/amp = 0.9 $\nSo, you will need to pay $0.9.

In this way, the first ant gets a petal to take back to the queen. So the second ant goes to the petalless flower that has the ant who just took one petal, and so on, until they've all gone.\n\nNow, this was just to figure out which ant to send on each flower, once that's done, the ants return to the naked flower and the petals are picked up, one by one, as the ants run around the flower, picking up petals one by one, without colliding. Then the ants go around the ant pile and bring the petals back to the queen, in the order in which they found them, with the ant back at the pile first.

{"text": "Mark gets 20 cents in his change\n\n### Explanation:\nMark spends $7.00 at the grocery store, but he gives the cashier only $4.20 + $2.05 = 6.25. So the cashier has spent less than he receives.  He must get change and he must have the following coins of the same denomination: 1 or 2 quarters and the same amount of dimes and nickels +1 quarter, or a quarter and the same denomination with the same number of dimes and nickles.\n\nThe sum of all the values of the same coins equals to $7.00 / 1.25 = 5.60 and as a decimal is exactly 5.6.  Then 56 coins could do the job, but since 56 is exactly divisible by 6 then one more coin and 57 coins are needed. This could not be 2 quarters or just 2 dimes and a nickel since not $7.00 could not be spent in that way. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so that means 2 dollars must be spent with 3 quarters and 1 dime and therefore $4.00 would be spent for a dollar with one or 2 quarters. \n\nMark then pays $4.20 in this case, therefore in his change must be 4 quarters and 0.80 cents. So the sum of 4 quarters + 0.80 equals 4.80 cents and as a decimal is also 4.8, which are 10 quarters. But 10 quarters can not be given to the customer, because the customer did not pay any nickels. To avoid this the cashier must also spend a nickel, therefore he has to spend $5.00. Mark's change is then 4.80 + 0.05 = 4.85 and as a decimal is 4.85. In short: 1.25x4.8 + 0.06 = 4.83 quarters plus 0.95 cents in nickels.\n\n#### Instruction:Prove that in the realm of mathematics any idea", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "4\n\n#### First Solution\n\nThe number of boiled eggs is equal to 3 * the number of adults + the sum of two numbers + 1 + 2.\n\nThe number of girls is 7, but we do not know how many girls came for the trip, because we do not know if each girl has a snack.\n\nBut because the number of girls is at least 7, the number of eggs of which each adult got 3 eggs is 15. I do not remember the name of such an operation. But there is an operation in which you increase the number by dividing by X (such a name sounds like division) and then divide by X again (or, rather, you return to the operation you just did). For example, 5 + 5 * 2 = 17. And if you say 17 / 2 = 8, all your operation is 8.\n\nNow, the sum of two numbers is 10, because each girl got 1 egg more than each boy.\n\nNow we got some results.\n\nSo, the sum of two results is 37.\n\nFrom our equation:\n\nNumber of boiled eggs = 3 * the number + the sum +1 + 2\n\nWe can assume that the number of boiled eggs = (3 * the number + sum +2) - 3 girls\n\nSolving, we get that the sum is 36. We know that each person got 3 eggs, then this number is 2.\n\nLet P= the sum, then P = 36 - 2 * 3\n\nTherefore, P = 4.\n\nAgain, 7 girls = 2 * 3 = 2 * 4 - 2 * 2 = 4 * 3 - 2 * 1 = 2 boys\n\nThe number of boys * 4 - 7 * 4 = 4 boys\n\n### Second Solution\n\n1. Sum is 24 eggs\n2. 3 adults\n3. 4 girls\n4. So, the number of boys is 4", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "The answer, from the first 2 sentences, should be 14 sweets. We know this from the following 2 rules:\n1. The first rule is: \"Half of all\" so half of 14 would be 7. I don't think we need to explain that.\n2. The second rule is: \"4 more\". The 1st rule was \"Half of all\", this means it's impossible to answer that with an exact number. If we answered it with an exact number, like \"7\", then it would only be half of 14. We can't have 7 sweets on the table after the first 7 sweets. So this means it must be 4+7=11 sweets.\nWe know that \"take half of all\" means there must have been 14 sweets on the table before Jack came. He took half of these which means he got 7. Paul then came and took the remaining. Paul said he took the'remaining 7' so now in total his and jack's portion is now 14. This means that there are only 14 sweets left on the table. And also the first 2 sentences said that Jack came _and_ took half and also Paul came _and_ took the remaining. This means they got it all in the end. This also answers the first 2 questions:\n1.

{"text": "The answer is $6.25\n\n### Explanation: The red horseshoe magnet cost 3 times as much as the sticker, but the total cost of the magnet and the sticker would have been 25 cents less than the two stuffed animals. The stuffed animals were a quarter the cost of the sticker, which means that the stuffed animals were worth 25 cents each. To buy two stuffed animals, Tish would have paid $5.00. Each stuffed animal costs a quarter more than the red magnet, which means that an individual stuffed animal costs 75 cents, or $1.50. We subtract the total cost (25 cents) and the price of the sticker (25 cents), which equals the price of the stuffed animals. The answer is $6:25\n\n## Conceptual Thinking\n\n* What is the difference between mathematical and conceptual thinking?\n\n    Mathematical thinking is the part of critical thinking that is used for numbers and measurements. It uses a system for problem solving.\n* Can mathematical thinking and conceptual thinking both be used when completing tasks? How?\n\n    Mathematics and math are essential in completing tasks. Both can be used for completing tasks. Mathematics is the study of how to use and manipulate numbers. Math can help to add, subtract, or multiply, in order to solve a challenge.\n* What problems have you experienced from not knowing mathematical concepts when trying to complete tasks?\n\n    When I don\u2019t know a mathematical concept I tend to leave a task incomplete.\n### Questions for future learning:\n\n* Can you give an example of how you use mathematical thinking to solve a problem?\n\n    I have a large group of students at school. They have taken a test and did not study for any of the questions. My job is to get them thinking. I teach children math concepts.\n\n* What is a concept you have already known that you will need to learn more about in order to solve a problem? What is a concept you are completely unfamiliar with that will help you figure out how to solve a problem? Do not assume that there are no problems that require complete unfamiliarity with concepts.\n\n    A concept that I have already known that I will need to learn to solve problems is that you have to know the concepts or rules", "answer": " 6"}

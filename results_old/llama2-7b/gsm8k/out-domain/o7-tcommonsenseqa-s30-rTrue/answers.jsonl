Choices: A. piano player B. a musician who is so gifted that they can play the piano C. a musician who plays any other instrument except the piano D. a pianist who can play very well\nRationales: Here, we must first understand what piano master means. Based on the wording of the question, it seems that this is someone who is considered highly skilled or proficient in playing the piano, someone who is not just an ordinary piano player.\nAs for the answer choices, we have the following: A, piano player - someone who plays the piano B, a musician who is proficient at playing any musical instrument except the piano - piano master is a piano player. C, a musician who plays piano well D, a pianist who is exceptionally good at playing the piano - a piano master is a person who plays the piano well or a musician who is gifted in playing the piano.\nFor all the answers, except for answer C, a piano master is someone considered highly skilled at playing the piano.\nTherefore, the correct answer is: D, a pianist that plays piano so well that they are considered to be a piano master.\n\nInput: What type of job would someone have who spends most of their time teaching children how to perform various athletic feats?

What is the total cubic footage in my fruit bowl? Chooses:  A: 3 cubic feet B: 4 cubic feet C: 12 cubic feet D: 24 cubic feet E: cubic feet\nRationales: Let's start by looking at our unit of measure, which is cubic feet. What does this refer to? It refers to the volume of an 18-inch cube. So it refers to space, not a count of apples, or a weight measurement.\n1. Looking at the answer-choices, it is clear that only 2 of the 5 answer-choices (3 and 4, 24 and 12 cubic footage) refer to the unit of measure cubic footage.\n2. The cubic footage of one cup of apples is 1; this relates to the volume of one unit (see above) of the given unit (cu. feet).\n3. So, our next step is to look at the number of cups of apples and the volume of the bowl. (12 cups and 1 cubic ft)\n4. We have:\n         -12 cups = 1 cubic footage\n              (C.f.)\n       3 ft \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 cups = 4.23 ft\u00b2\n5.

Choices:  S: an accident B: intentional C: cat eats dog D: cat eats fish E: cat only likes dogs\nRationales: It asks a riddle with the answer as Cat eats dog. This question asks to identify whether an answer is correct or not.\n1. The answer Cat eats dog (Choice D) is the most accurate and suitable option.\n2. The word 'eat' does not necessarily mean the consumption of food because it also refers to eating up, devouring, or destroying/killing.\n3. Therefore, it can easily relate to cat eats dog (Choice 4).\n4. Although cats are often seen enjoying chicken and fish (Option C), the word eat refers not only to consumption of food but also 'eating up' and killing. Hence cat eats chicken (Choice B) and cat eating fish (Choice D) do not represent what the question describes.\n5. Option B: cat eats chicken can also be eliminated as it does not describe cat eating up.\n6. Thus, the correct answer is D: cat eats dog.\n7. The", "answer": " 14"}

Choices:  A) Learning B) Classroom C) Play D) Laughter E) Squirming\nRationales: The question asks what comes to mind when hearing the word \u2018school\u2019.\n1. 'Learning' is only one definition of school, and although most school-related tasks involve learning, there are other activities associated with school.\n2. 'Classroom' is also a school-related activity, and is only one type of education setting besides a \u2018classroom\u2019. \n3. The definition \u2018school\u2019 includes different settings e.g., homes, recreation, churches, etc., all of which imply educational activities.\n4. Hence, the option 'classroom' cannot be the correct answer.\n5. 'Play' implies having fun, but this does not necessarily involve education. For example, playing at home is still only playing. However, going to a park could be a play activity if the aim is to learn about the park. \n6. In the same way, going to a play park to learn about it is playing. Therefore, play can be an answer to the question, but it is not specific to school only.\n7. 'Laughter' might be associated with entertainment at school, or even with enjoyment, but this wouldn\u2019t necessarily be related to education at school.\n8. 'Squirming', although related to school, may be associated with being uncomfortable or nervous during a task. \n9. However, this does not seem like the correct answer since it", "answer": " 216"}

Choices:  I: a dog on a leash II: a stick III: a human IV: a wheelchair V: a bicycle\nRationales: Starting by considering the options provided in the question, a dog on a leas (Choice I), allows for one to look ahead, as stated explicitly. \nNext, think about what other items we would normally use and take into consideration when walking, along with their potential benefits or limitations, such as a walking cane (Choice III). This is a commonly used, useful device for those who use it to walk with and have the potential to aid in movement and direction; however, a cane does not let one look ahead like I (dog), II (stick), and IV (wheelchair).  \nNext, think about other items that are commonly used to support movement and aid in walking without relying on a human, such as IV (wheelchairs), Choice V (bicycles), or Choice III (a cane), but those do not allow one to look ahead.\nNext, consider options that are commonly used to aid mobility, such as IV (a wheelchair). A wheelchair can do one of two things; it can move someone or they can move someone with it, but it does not allow one to look behind or look ahead.  \nSimilarly, Choice V (a bicycle), while it does help a person move without relying completely on their own body, it still relies on a person to guide it and does not automatically allow", "answer": " 14000"}

They might be professionals but they may also be recreational runners belonging to a group of people who are doing it for a common interest.\n3. Young persons, elderly persons, families and professional athletes are examples of possible categories of people who could run marathons together or in a group.

Anxiety\n\nInput: The best and most reasonable time to buy a home is? \nChoices:  A: never B: winter C: a day before winter D: when buying a home is the least popular time to buy a home? E: when a home is ready to be bought \nRationales: Question asks - what is the best and most reasonable time I buy a home.\n1. 'Best' can be understood as - what is the optimum time. \n2. 'Reasonable' can be understood as- What is a rational time to buy a home. i.e., the time that doesn\u2019t lead to any unnecessary financial stress? \n3. With what is least popular to do something - 'least popular' is not the same as 'best'. \n4. Therefore, we have a contradiction.\n5. If 'best' and 'least popular' were inversely proportional in some way, then it would make sense to pick home buying seasons when buying is least popular, which, in this case means winter.\n6. However, 'Reasonable' has the opposite word, 'rational'. 'Rational', here, implies something that can be done without overthinking. \n7. 'Home buying' is not a process that requires a lot of rationality, but it is a process that has a lot of other elements that require rationality.\n8. To find out what is the best and reasonable time to buy a house, we consider what is the optimum decision when rationality can be factored out of the problem.\n9. It makes no sense to buy a home when it is popular, to begin with.\n10. To get the actual answer, just consider the 'best' and'reasonable' separately. \n10. We start with the 'best'. Considering that 'best' may denote - the optimal decision, which is the single time over all that would", "answer": " 2"}

Choice B: talented persons cannot suffer from injury does not make sense in the context of the question, thus it is likely a mistake.\n8. Choice C: anxiety is the correct answer as it can be a mental or emotional condition that could cause feelings of worry or unease and may lead a person to avoid performing.\n9. Choice D: happiness indicates a certain degree of excitement, which contradicts the condition as it would suggest an opposite feeling of the person.\n10. Choice E: energetic is too general not specific to stage fright or performance anxieties. They are not restricted to persons who are full of energy and enthusiasm.\n11. Thus, choice C: anxiety is correct for the given answer. \n12. In summary, someone who is talented and doesn\u2019t like performing could likely suffer from anxiety or a related condition that make them feel uncomfortable on stage.\nAnswer: C : anxiety\n\nInput: If a person likes to be neat but also likes to do activities that are more spur-of-the-moment, which of the following is most likely to be true about them? Choices: 1. A: This person spends a lot of time cleaning and organizing. 2. B: This person is flexible and willing to try different activities. 3. C: This person likes to have things under control. 4. D: This person is easily overwhelmed and stresses out quickly. 5. E: This person finds it hard to make decisions.\nRationales:\n1. Understand the question thoroughly. The question asks us what is most likely to be the description of a person who likes being neat but enjoys doing activities that are more spontaneous.\n2. The answer choices are: This person spends much time cleaning and organising, This person is flexible and eager to try different activities, This person likes having things under his/her control, This person quickly gets stressed and overwhelmed, This person finds it hard for making decisions.\n3. When you look at all the answer choices, you can notice that choices A, B, D, and E seem to not fit the criteria stated in the question, as they imply the opposite of what is expected.

A personality trait like talent persons cannot suffer from injuries and anxiety (Choice B) is a nonsensical suggestion.\n9. Anxiety itself (Choice C) is an instance of a mental or emotional condition that can hinder someone from enjoying performing.\n10. So, the only option that fits the given description of an instance of anxiety, is anxiety (Choice C).\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: A good teacher should inspire their students even without intending to do so, this is why it is a good trait of what type of teacher? Choices:  B: bad C: average D: good E: excellent\nRationales:   1. The question is about the positive traits that a teacher should possess, specifically, the ability to inspire or motivate students without intentionally trying to do so.\n2. This indicates that a good teacher is someone who can make an impact on their students by simply being themselves or interacting with them in their own way.\n3. Efficient instruction and good communication skills are fundamental for positive teaching engagement, but this does not mean that good teachers would have to take special effort to be inspiring or motivating.\n4. In other words, any teacher is capable of inspiring and motivating their students.\n5. Based from the choices given, bad and average teachers are deemed as incompetent. While excellent teachers are those who excel among their peers, they are still evaluated as being competent to teach.\n6. Good teachers, on the other hand, are teachers whose competency is evident in various ways.\n7. Considering good and excellent teachers as being equal in terms of their competency, the best choice would probably be good teachers, for they are teachers who simply possess the core basic values that good teachers should have, such as being capable of inspiring students to learn and be involved with their curriculum. \n8.

The sentence stating that talent persons cannot suffer from anxiety and butterflies (Choice B) is somewhat of an assumption without sufficient evidence; what if they do? Someone who is talented but doesn\u2019t want to perform is not necessarily a terrible performer, they could just be scared.\n8. The options of Happiness (Choice C) or Energetic (Option E) are too general and broad to be correct.\n9. Looking at the two options remaining, Anxiety (Choice D) is specifically discussed in the task and is described as being a mental condition which could explain why the person is being reluctant to perform.\n10. Therefore, the most appropriate answer to the question is anxiety.\nAnswer: D anxiety\n\nInput: What makes an ice-cream parlor more popular than a bakery? Choices: \nA: free samples\nB: more space\nC: less space\nD: less overhead\nE: no overhead\nRationales:\n1. The question asks which of the given answer choices is responsible for making an ice-creamparlor more popular than a\nbakery. \n2. Here, we can rule out the options which don't directly affect customer patronage; for example, the choice 'A: free samples' doesn't directly make a difference because it's irrelevant to the popularity.\n3. The available spaces for each business can either make them competitive or comparable if the spaces are the same. However, it can't contribute directly to their popularity.\n4. The options 'C: Less space' and 'D: Less overhead' are not specific enough and don't directly contribute to customer satisfaction or experience.\n5. The choice 'no overhead' is a possibility. But overhead refers to financial risks, or financial responsibilities. In a business, overhead refers to the expenses beyond what it earns in revenue. However, we don't really know if the bakery has risks or expenses beyond its revenue, so we can't include this in the answer choices.\n6. 'B: more space' is a good answer choice because it's very specific. The iceCream parlor has much more space, providing more comfort and accessibility to its customers, making them", "answer": " 10"}

Talent persons cannot suffer from injury (Choice B) is not possible unless injured talent persons can suffer from injury.\n8. Anxiety (choice C) is considered to be a possible answer, as the person feels anxious in the presence of an audience. However, anxiety can also mean worried or nervous before or during a performance.\n9. Happiness (Choice D) would not be considered an illness as it is considered to be pleasant.\n10. Energy (Choice E) is not a desirable state of mind for a performer as it makes them stressed about their presentation.\n11. Hence, we select the option A: injury as it is the most appropriate response as injury can cause the performer to lose interest in enjoying performing. \n\nAnswer: A: injury\n\nInput: Where do animals roam in the wilderness?

A: parks, zoos, and aquariums B: the ocean C: the mountains D: these are all valid responses E: all of the above\nRationales:\nInput: It is to choose any answer that includes a correct or best option or multiple correct and the best option.\n1. Parks, zoos, and Aquariums (choice A): These are valid places where animals roam inside the wilderness.\n2. The ocean (choice B): It is a valid place to go where animals roam through the wilderness. The only difference is that it isn't usually within the land of the wilderness. \n3. The mountains (choice C): It is also another place where animals roam in the wild, such as the mountains or in the highlands of Africa.\n4.

Anxiety, which causes worry or unease, is a likely condition that an individual with stage fright would possibly suffer from.\n9. Anxiety is also reflected in the word 'energetic' in the remaining answer choices by mentioning \"energy\".\n1. Option C: anxiety is then a suitable answer. Anxiety can be a likely condition that one who is talented but not happy with performing might be suffering from.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: What would you usually do when it\u2019s raining? Choices: \tA: sleep B: go to the beach\tC: swim D: eat E: stay at home\nRationales: This is a typical scenario, in which we are likely to ask, what do you usually do when it is raining?\n1. Someone who prefers to stay at home does not typically go to a beach regardless of time or weather.\n2. Also, there is a possibility that they will go to bed if there is already a nap taken during the day, but there is no restriction that they must take a nap when it rains.\n3. Similarly, eating may or may not have association with it raining and does not necessarily mean it is a habitual thing to do.\n4. Swimming is a good option to mention, as swimming can become a little difficult if it\u2019s raining.\n5. Staying at home is an option to consider, unless a swimming pool is indoors, in which case rain will not hinder swimming.\n6. It is evident that sleeping would be an appropriate response, as it is a usual response to the question and sleeping provides you with the comfort inside your house.\n7.

'Butterflies' (Choice B) refers to a state of nerves, however, it does not directly speak to the reason behind someone's stage fright.\n9. Hence, the answer to this question would be 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\nInput: If it is a nice day, the children are not going to play indoor and vice versa, are they? Choices:  - A: yes B: no C: depends\nRationales:1. The question asks if the children will play indoor even if it\u2019s a good weather outside for playing. \n2. Outdoor activities are typically more enjoyable and preferable than indoor activities.\n3. We can eliminate 'no' because although it sounds like the answer, it is not a logical choice.\n4. 'No' refers to kids only playing indoors. This is not necessarily true because they could perform an activity inside a building, and then move to outdoors to continue it.\n5. In the meantime, we\u2019ve excluded 'no' and 'depends\u2019 because they don\u2019t seem to be appropriate answer options.\n6. Choice B can be eliminated as 'no'.\n7. We should next analyze Choice A and Choice C as they are the final two options. \n8. 'Yes' seems plausible as a possible answer since no matter how nice the weather is outside, children will most likely play indoor.\n9. An argument can be made that under severe extreme weather, the children will still choose to play indoors.\n10. However, these extreme situations are rarely found in daily life.\n11. In the usual circumstance, 'Yes' will be more likely than 'No', which should be the case in this instance.\n12. Thus, the answer to 'If it is a nice day', the children are not going indoor and vice versavera, are they? is 'Ye'.\nAnswer: A: yes\n\nInput: An adjective modifying 'happy' is what?

A: promote the new cars at carshows 2. B: launch new cars in a conference 3. C: launch new cars to car dealerships 4. D: invites media people to promote the car 5. E: none of the choices\nRationales: The instructions have one task and two options. Hence, we should choose the answer.\n6. Evaluate the choices:\n    A. A car show is an event that showcases new and existing, as well as rare, cars, often for the purpose of promoting a brand or a product to the public, rather it is for the car manufacturers or their clients to launch new models.\n    B. Launching new cars in a conference is an activity primarily about informing attendees about a new product's features and benefits and making presentations for publicity.\n    C. The company launches cars to car dealers so that they, as dealerships, sell vehicles to customers.\n    D.

'Talent persons cannot suffer from injury' (Choice B) is a little odd since someone who is talented in performing should be able to perform no matter what physical injury they may have.\n8. 'Anxiety' (Choice C) does not fit the description because the term 'butterflies' used is synonymous with nervousness and anxiety, which means that we would not expect someone who is feeling anxious to also experience the sensation of butterflies in their stomach.\n9. Happiness (Choice D) is the opposite of what we're looking for, and therefore can be discarded.\n10. 'Energetic' (Choice E) also doesn't make sense because the word energy is frequently used to describe someone who is passionate, enthusiastic, or full of life. We would not expect someone who enjoys performing to also be full of energy. Instead, if someone enjoys performing, they would likely be feeling more peaceful, relaxed, and energized by their performance instead of feeling uncomfortable.\n11.

Choices: 1 : without teeth 2: with teeth A: without teeth B: with teeth\nRationales:\n1. The question asks how people used to eat before they had teeth.\n2. The choice can be a statement, a group of words, or a phrase that expresses a fact, an opinion, or a choice about something.\n3. Hence, the choice should reflect a logical reasoning or an argument, as it is not about stating a fact as it is a hypothetical.\n4. Choice 1 states that people would eat without teeth without providing any justification. However, this is not plausible according to human biology.\n5. Consider the wording of Choice 2; 'people eat with teeth'. This is a logical deduction; humans have teeth and thus eat.\n6. Thus, the answer choice with Teeth (Choice B) is the best answer choice.\n7. Choice 1 is incorrect because people would not be able to eat without teeth.\nAnswer : B: with teeth\n\nInput: Why did the shark cross the road?

Arnold Schwarzenegger (Choice D) is excluded since he is not a person who would play Batman according to the given information. \n2. Jimmy Stewart (Choice E) is out of scope as he will not be playing Batman in any existing movies or movie adaptations.\n3. Hence, we have left Ron Howard (Choice C), George Burns (Choice B), and John Wayne (Choice A).\n4. John Wayne (Choice A) seems unlikely as he has a limited acting repertoire in movies. \n5. Ron Howard (Choice C) probably had a wider variety of roles but he also isn't an actor of that caliber, so he is inappropriate per scope. \n6. George Burns (Choice C) seems much more likely to portray Batman than John Wayne (Choice A), in spite of his age.\n7.

Perfectionism is often associated with good qualities that are difficult to achieve, such as hard-work, diligence, and commitment. But one cannot feel admiration toward someone solely because of their perfectionism; admiration can also come from other qualities that a talented person may possess.\n2. As such, we can eliminate option A from the answer choices, as it contradicts what perfectionism represents.\n3.

However, they aren't usually looking at the windshield for fuel discounts, gas coupons, or sticker coupons they could put onto their bumper.\n2.

Choices: 1. A: yes 2. B: not necessary 3. C: depends on the strength of the wind 4. D: depends on the size of the umbrella 5. E: no\nRationales: Option A and B are false because a stronger wind can blow over a smaller umbrella easily if it\u2019s too flimsy, so larger umbrellas would still be better in that case.\nOption C is true, a bigger umbrella will block more wind, but it is not necessarily 100% necessary because the strength of the wind will also block more wind.\nOption E is false because a bigger umbrella does not necessarily cover you more, it will only protect you more the more wind it blocks.\nOption D is correct.

Anxiety (Choice C) generally refers to unwanted feelings of nervousness and anticipation when one is in anticipation of something that one fears or something one feels threatened by. It is an emotion-driven behavioral response.\n9. Happiness (Choice E) may or may not be related to fear or anxiety.\n10. An energetic performer (Choice D) could be enjoying performing without being anxious or fearful, so this is also not an answer choice.\n11. Therefore, given the description of the given condition, it is appropriate to answer choice C: anxiety.\n12. Anxiety (choice C) is a state of mental and physical arousal, it causes a multitude of symptoms such as trembling hands, increased heart rate, racing thoughts, difficulty breathing, tense muscles, and nausea. \n13. However, the person may still be able to manage the task at hand, meaning a good level of performance anxiety and enjoyment is also achievable.\n14.

Anxiety is a natural emotional response to the prospect of performing and so this could be a logical answer based on the description provided. However, anxiety can affect all kinds of people, regardless of skill levels, so this does not seem to be the most appropriate response.\n9. Happiness (Choice C) and Energy (Choice D) are also not suitable answer choices because someone suffering from stage fright is not necessarily unhappy or lacking in energy.\n10.

Choices: \tA: once every time you use it B: never C: every time D: every day E: every week\nRationales: - This question is asking about checking the door to make sure it is locked.\n- You would only make sure you lock it every day if you use it every day.\n- You only need to check the door to make if it is locked once in case you leave it unlocked.\n- It also does not matter which door you are referring to when you check to make sure it is closed and locked.\n- Since you do not say how many times you check the door to see if it is locked or closed, this cannot be used to determine the correct answer.\n- Some people have doors that only need to be checked every month or more, while others have doors that need to be checked every single day.\n- Hence, the answer has to be (C) every time.\nAnswer: C) every time\n\nInput: I can swim.

Choices: 1. A: to avoid damage from theft 2. B: to save costs 3. C: to access in different places 4. D: to comply with government regulations E: for easy management\nRationales: The wording of this question can be improved. There's nothing in the text that says that businesses are in fact choosing to store their information on cloud servers. \n1. This is a common misinterpretation of the wording in the question. While it's implied that businesses may choose to store their data on cloud servers, the question explicitly asks why businesses are choosing to do so, not whether or not they are choosing to do so.\n2. Because this question asks us to identify the primary motivation behind businesses' preference for moving data to cloud servers, it can be helpful to compare and contrast the different motivations listed in the choices.\n3. For Choice C, access in different places, it's not clear why businesses would prefer a distributed system such as that provided by cloud servers to personal computers that could be accessed anywhere, potentially.\n4. For Choice D, to comply with government information-handling regulations, it's also not clear why businesses wouldn't just store their data locally. As long as no data is lost or stolen, it's still legal data and would be stored in a cloud server in the same way.\n5. For Choice E, for easy management, cloud servers provide the option to have a company's data managed by experts.

Choices: \nA: he would get a hug from law enforcement B: the robber would shoot him C: the robber would get arrested D: the agent may escape E: the bank robber may run for his life\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about a situation after a law enforcement agent rescues a person from captivity. In other words, it wants to know what would happen next.\n2. We can find that the given answer choices do not directly refer to the situation at hand, but instead relate to events preceding the scene, or events that might occur afterward.\n3. For this question, the best answer will be a continuation of what the man would do, who is now a captive, after being rescued from captivity by the law enforcement agent.\n\n4. In this case, the man would be in a position to either run for his life (Choice D) or get arrested by the law enforcement (Choice E).\n\n5. The law enforcement agent, however, could choose either to shoot the man or protect him (Choice C and B respectively).\n\n6. The two events of the man running away or getting arrested would be followed by repercussions for everyone involved.\n\n7.

Choices:  C: fishing license (A) C: fishing line (B) C: fish (C) C: poles (d) C: boat\nRationales:\n1. The phrase, 'what do you need to obtain', implies that we must identify all the things required to complete a task before the options can be provided.\n2. The question also doesn't specify whether these components are singular or plural; the key word being 'need' implies that more than one is required.\n3. This further emphasizes that all the provided components in the question are components required to go fishing.\n4. Analyze the provided options:\n    A: a fishing license is mandatory when it comes to fishing because it allows you to legally fish in certain areas. However, it is not necessary to obtain a license if you want to go fishing. Hence, this component is not correct.\n    B: a fishing line is not applicable since it is not needed to go fishing. This is because we can fish with out a fishing line.\n    C: C is the only option that makes sense. This is because the fish is needed to actually catch a fish while poles are used to catch a fish.\n    D: is incorrect since a boat is also not suitable for fishing.\n5.

Choices: A: variable C: hypothesis D: experiment E: null hypothesis\nRationales: Start by eliminating choices that are already well-defined. For example, 'experiment', 'data', and 'hypothesis' are all well-known terms in the field of statistics, so we can cross them off the list. That leaves us with 'variable' and 'null hypothesis'. Both terms could potentially be elements of an experiment.\n1. Next, consider how each option is defined. For example, 'variable' indicates an aspect of an experiment that is influenced by the experimenter. So something that remains the same throughout the experiment, such as 'control' or 'observation', would qualify as a variable while something that does not change during the experiment, such as time or money, could be classified as a control.\n2. A 'hypothesis', on the other hand, can be tested in an experiment. So a null hypothesis, which is not a prediction or a statement of belief, would not be an element of an experiment since it cannot be tested nor rejected/accepted.\n3. Therefore, the most appropriate response is 'null hypothesis' since it is not an element of the experiment.\n\nAnswer: B: null hypothesis\n\nInput: Which kind can also be called an organic compound?

An adverse response refers to a harmful reaction that arises from a particular stimulus or activity when exposed to it for a prolonged period of time, usually resulting in physical or mental harm.\n2. A bike race is an occasion where the performer is active and exerting energy.\n3. On the other hand, drinking beer is a practice typically taken as an enjoyable indulgence in leisure settings, typically not involving strenuous physical or mental effort.\n4. Hence, we can observe that drinking beer on a race day typically does not require significant physical or mental energy exertion, hence unlikely to produce an adverse reaction.\n5. Considering the options provided by the question,\n6. Choice A (fatigue) is highly likely as fatigue means extreme physical weakness or mental exhaustion, caused by physical or mental exertion.\n7. Option B (nausea) may occur as a result of alcohol-related vomiting due to excessive consumption of alcohol.

Therefore, 'talent persons are unable to suffer from injury and buttterflies' (option B) can be corrected but it does not provide the desired answer either.\n9. 'Anxiety' (Choice C), on the other hand, does fit the condition of \u2018stage fright\u2019 so it can be kept.\n10. We are left with either 'happiness' (Choice D) or 'eager' (Choice E), but \u2018happiness' here refers to \u2018pleasure.\u2019 and 'eager' does not provide an effect/state of talented people.\n8. Hence option D and E can be eliminated. \n11. Between 'happiness' and 'anxiety,' 'anxious' is a common state of those who have stage fright and it fits the condition.

For example, the phrase 'to reheat a meal' can be used to refer to warming leftover food that had already been cooked.\nIf you know that to heat can also be used as a verb to refer to the state of being hot, you know that something that is hot could be placed in a microwave ovens.

Anxiety (Choice C) is an indicator of fear and worry, but stage fright also involves the emotion of unease, as the question states that the person is reluctant when faced with a performance.\n9. It\u2019s unlikely that someone suffering from anxiety would enjoy performing, as this would require a level of confidence, self-assurance, and confidence, which can be difficult to attain when feeling anxious.\n10. Similarly, \u2018happiness\u2019 (Choice D) would be unlikely as stage fright tends towards the other end of the emotional spectrum, being worry or fear.\n11. \u2018Energetic\u2019 (Choice E) means being full of energy or enthusiasm. A person suffering from stage fright may not necessarily be energetic, as this can be a positive emotion and stage fright is largely negative.\n12.

Start by considering the different kinds of animals, such as dogs, lions, fish, cows, and pigs.\n3. Eight of the list of animals here, including the cat, do not belong together.\n4. Therefore the correct answer is lions (Choice b).\n5. Cat (Choice e) belongs to \"the cat family\" which is a distinct classification of animals that includes the lion.\n6. While the lion is also in the cat family, it is not a member of \"the cat family\" as they have different taxonomic classifications within that group (Order Carnivora and suborder Feliformia). \n7. Hence, the lion (Choice b) does not belong to the group and is the best response.\n8. Therefore the correct answer choice is b:  lion.\nAnswer: b: lion\n\nInput: The word 'envision' means to which of the following?

Choices: \nA: Most venomous snakes are cobras B: Some cobras are venomous C: Some non-venomous snakes are venomous D: Not all venomous snakes can coil their bodies E: All cobras are venous\nRationales:\n1. The question asks you to draw a conclusion based on some information given about cobras.\n2. All cobras (Choice E) would be the most incorrect answer, because only some cobras are venemous.\n3. Some venomous snakes (Choice D) may be correct, but it does not necessarily mean that all venomous snaked can coil their bodies.\n4. Some non-venomious snakes (Choice C) are not necessarily venomous. Venomous snakes produce toxins to kill things. For it to be a logical conclusion, there should be a certain relationship between snakes in general and their venom.\n5.

It's important to consider the options and what they entail: having a (option A), developing a (option B), practicing the plan (option C), having three (option D), or having two plans (option E).\n3. Option A: having a plan, means one pre-plans with the necessary steps that they can follow in order to react to the disruption or disaster when it happens. \n4. Option B: developing a plan would mean that a team has drafted a plan for an anticipated event and then goes into action when the event happens. \n5. Option C: practicing a plan means that it's put into practice and executed by the organization that developed it.\n6. Option D: having three plans, means having three possible plans of action.\n7. Option E: having two plans is not plausible because two plans only leaves us with one available in the scenario of failure to avoid a disruption, which is not ideal for a business' safety.\n8.

'butterflies' (a mild stress or uneasiness) could perhaps be a reason why a talented person would feel unenthusiastic about performing, however the word does not appear in the original question.\n9. Choice C: anxiety could be a possible answer, as it is a condition that could lead to feelings of self-doubt or nervousness, negatively impacting one\u2019s attitude toward performing.\n10.

Choices:  I: she does not like to think II: her age III: she does not watch movies IV: she is not very intelligent V: she likes to dance VI: she is not too emotional\nRationales:1. The question asks about the color pink, which one can interpret as a statement, \"all women who are not wearing pink\". To find out their likes or dislikes, one should assume the statement is true, which can be done through the use of the following logical rule \"If X bears A then X bears B\". This indicates that \"If all women who are not we-aring pink like all things that women typically like or do, then they must also like to watch movies and be intelligent\".\n2. To interpret the logical rule, one can look the options which are \"does not think, her age, does not watch movies, is not very intelligent, likes to dance, and is not too emotional\"\n3.

So option #1 and 3 might be considered for the outcome as these are the only plausible choices.\n6. However, out of the two, option #3 is more logical, as it is possible to gain weight and muscle at the same time. \n7. Also, option #4 seems a little unlikely for the outcome as 'healthy' and'muscle gain' are usually associated more with lifestyle and regular exercise rather than with eating.\n8.

The adjectives 'thin' (B),'medium' (D), and'short' (F) do not apply to 'dark-haired'. Hence, they eliminate them as the most applicable feature.\n3.

They may feel happy, but this will not remove stage fright or performance anxieties from its context.\n9. It's possible someone with stage fright or performance anxities could also be happy (option D), but this doesn't mean that happiness is the cause of this condition (or vice versa).\n10. This leaves us with option E, \u2018energetic\u2019. While energetic people can feel happy, this is not guaranteed, and it\u2019s highly unlikely that this would be the direct cause of stage fright as well.\n11.

Each of the given answer options is an insect; they all fall into the same category. Therefore, there's no need to filter any of the given answer options. \n2. When measuring length, a bug/insect may be considered small, medium or large due to variation in length. \n3. The common sense knowledge that insects come in different sizes indicates the possibility of long, medium and short insects. We don't know the actual insect but we can deduce an estimate. The given answer options have different lengths which range from a relatively small insect to the largest insect. \n4. Longest insect = Long. \n5.

The question asks which of the given alternatives would be a correct way to say something funny, cruel or a nasty about a person.\n2. 'Rude' is not suitable for this question because it simply means displaying poor social manners. \n3. 'Disrespectful' describes someone who treats others with disregard and should not be used because the sentence is not asking for a definition of a person who disrespects others.\n4.

Choices: 2: bluefish 3: sardine 4: salmon 5: marlin\nRationales:1: Sardine (Option 3) doesn't match the picture which features a blue fish in the blueish corner.\n2: Salmon (Option 4) doesn't match - the body of this fish is pink so it doesn't feature salmon skin colour.\n3: Bluefish (Option 2) doesn't fit. The fish's colour is too light to be considered a typical colour of a bluefish.\n4: Marlin (Option 5) also doesn't match - not only is its colour not pink, but marlin is a bigger fish, not the size this one is.\nAnswer: 1: bluefish\n\nInput: We saw 34 elephants on the way to the zoo. How many more elephants did we see when we reached the zoo? Choices: 45, 30, 24, 15, 9\nRationales: Option 1 is incorrect.

However, this does not contradict the idea that not all talented individuals may experience butterflies or enjoy performing live.\n8.

It is how many years older than the dinosaurs? Choices:  K: 400 million Y: 43 million P: 16 million T: 10 years B: 70 years\nRationales:  1. The answer choices for this question are based on the number of years that an alleged animal is older than the dinosaur.\n2. It is evident from the answer choices that the answer to be selected is between 'K: 400 years older' and 'P: 16 million years older' as the answer options are either the dinosaur lived '400 million years ago' or 16 million years 'before'.\n3. Thus, it is clear from the given answer options that the correct response would be 'P: 14 million years older' as 'P' is the answer that is correct for this question.\n4.

Choices: 100%, 25%, 75%, \u00bc %, or \u00be%\nRationales: From the context and information provided, A Christmas Carol (Dickens), has one major character, Scrooge (who has changed) Tiny Tim, and an old miser called Marley (who is unchanged). They all have the similarities we have in their characters as the characters are all changing through time or perspective of the story. 1. As a result, the correct answer will simply be Scrooge (Character A and D), Tiny Tim (Character B and E), and Marley who is (Character C and F).\n2. Scrooge (Character D) is the one thing that each of the three characters have in common.\n3. It is possible that both the other characters have either option 100%, or 25%, or 75%, or \u00bc %, or 50%.\n4. As we have only two possible answer choices here, the options can be 100% (Characters A, C, and E), and 25% (Characters B and D).\n5. We have to add up the two options to make sure that they don't fall below 100%, as in the correct answer is required to be a 100%.\n6.

Choices:  a: natural b: artificial c: normal d: creative e: special\nRationales: For a creative person, they're born that way or come from a family with inherited talent. The natural ability doesn't have to be innate, but it's there since birth. \n1. This is supported by the fact that if you take an interest in an art or a skill, you can become even better at it than you already started out. \n2. With that in mind we consider the possible meanings for each answer choice.\n3. For normal, they must be the average person so not necessarily someone who has a natural talent at an art and or skill. \n4. Normal also could be related to creative as sometimes someone is born not able to do creative things yet with training and some level of natural ability they can be more than normal in a skill. \n5. For artificial and special, these two could be related to creatives. Artificial might mean that although they may have come from a non-creative background they picked it up later in life which would be special talent. \n6. But they might also both be used in other contexts besides creativity, the question wording could relate to someone that is born into wealth that they've acquired but not someone that is born talented. \n7. The following answers are not used for creative people. For example, natural is not used for creative, normal is not used for creatives, and artificial is not used for creatiive.\n8. So the most suitable answers for creative people are: A) natural - someone that was born with natural talent, or B) artificial - someone that", "answer": " 6"}

'Energetic' (Choice E) would seem like a more general description of a healthy mental or emotional state, and if someone is 'energetic', it does not make them more likely to suffer from stage fright or performance.

In all, Choice D: anxiety is the best answer because it fits the given description of someone who is talented, but doesn\u2019t like performing. \n10.

Choices: B: a chemical reactions C: an action D: the reaction E: chemical reaction\nRationales: Here, we have 5 answer choices in the form of nouns. There is only one right answer, which should be easy to spot in the sentence. Answers should be in 2nd person \"you\" form, not 3rd person \"him\" or \"her\" form. \n1. The sentence reads \"What do scientists study in the laboratory.\" This is a very clear indication that this sentence starts with a noun in 1st person \"I\" form, therefore \"the laboratory\" should be replaced by \"a laboratory\". This will make the sentence complete.\n2. We don't use \"lab\" as a verb, therefore, the sentence must be \"What do scientists *study* in the laboratory?\" There should be another noun after \"study\" to complete the sentence. A laboratory is one singular place where experiments are performed, so one can't \"do research\" in a laboratory, this should be replaced by \"perform experiment\".  \n3. The answer options are nouns, not verbs, and are only describing the outcome of experimentation. This is an indication that \"a chemical reaction\" (choice B), \"an action\" (choice C), \"the reaction\" (choice D), and \"chemical reaction\" (choice E) can't be the answer options. 4.

Anxiety (Choice B) could relate to the condition, but it doesn\u2019t indicate someone\u2019s discomfort in performances.\n9. Happiness (Choice D) wouldn\u2019t necessarily imply a lack of enjoyment in performing. Therefore, happiness wouldn\u2019t be the correct answer.\n10. Energetic (Choice E) is not related at all.\n11.

B: they are in need of dental work 3. C: they are afraid of spider webs 4. D: the bait store offers good rates 5. E: spiders like to fish\nRationales: The phrase 'dangle from hooks' indicates the fish are caught on hooks, which means they are stuck. Therefore, the correct answer should likely be something involving being stuck, possibly in pain.\n6. The options given are A: they suffer from a bad back; B: they are in desperate need of dental work; C: they are afraid to walk across spider webs; D: the bait shop offers good rates; and E: spiders love to fish.\n7. It is clear that they are being taken advantage of, as indicated by the phrases 'dangle from hook', 'desired of good rates', and 'bait shop offers good rates'.\n8. All options lacking the mentioned phrase should therefore be excluded.\n9. As it is a bait shop, it may be suspected that a spider is on the hunt for some fish to eat. The phrase 'like to fish' could indicate that spiders indeed enjoy fish. Hence, the answer can be eliminated. \n10.

The student's response can be interpreted as a clear indication that the student will take the exam earlier rather than later.\n2. They said \"I am taking them (the exams) early\", therefore this person is the type that is very honest.\n3. A person who is very honest would respond by saying they will take the exam earlier and would not state anything about being smart or dumb.\n4.

We have been asked to analyze the choice's characteristics and pick the only option that fits the description.\n\n1. The option of a car (A) is ruled out since it would have multiple engines.\n2. Bicycle (B) is an inherently different type of vehicle and cannot be ruled out unless further analysis of its characteristics indicates it can only have one engine running it.\n3. A truck (C) may be ruled out given the mention of the characteristics of a vehicle that cannot be multifunctional.\n4. An airplane (D), just like a car, would have multiple engines running it.\n5.

Choices:  the stomach upset, poor eye sight, a sore back, sleepiness, a fever\nRationales:1. The question asks about an adjective among the provided options which best describes the cause of a headached.\n2. Looking at the answer options, the most significant cause of a headache could be the stomach upsets and a poor vision or eyesight.\n3. Both can cause headaches by producing pain in certain regions of the body. A fever, on the other hand, could also be the cause of a head and back pain.\n4. A sore back does not cause headaches. However, if the back hurts, it can generate pain throughout the body such as the head.\n5. Given the options, a fever, poor eyesight, and a sore back are more likely. A sore back may be associated with headaches, however, the headache is not the primary symptom.\n6. In addition, poor eye sight and a sore back may not be the cause, but could result in headache and thus, are possible contributing factors.\n7. The answer to choose as the least likely is fever.\n8.

There are two main options: a. The truth of a statement (True) or falsehood (false) of a statement and b. If a statement is true or it is false not true (Not-true).\n2. The first one is true.

Inkling (option C) suggests that an individual has a notion, inclination, or a vague idea that they may be right. However, this has been in use without any context to the given question. \n2. Description (option D) refers to the act of describing someone or something. This could either be through written words or through an oration.\n3.

This phrase would be more appropriate if the person giving the description already has specific information about the place, rather than describing it as if it may be accurate. Therefore, the other would be the correct choice as \u201cdescribing\u201d means giving details that a reader would expect to be true.\n5.

Likewise, talent persons cannot suffer if they can perform to their best ability even if they don\u2019t enjoy the process. Butterflies (Choice B) do not pertain specifically to talent persons but rather to talent itself (as it relates to talent persons). A talent person can suffer from performance anxiety if they possess a talent, but are not performing their talent due to shyness or self-consciousness. \n8. Thus, someone with talent may not like to perform due to performance anxiety and this condition can cause significant fear, worry, and discomfort of the performer.\n9. In addition, butterflies (Choice C) could apply with the given answer but are not directly refernece either. Butterflies can be a sign of a talent person that is afraid to perform and therefore suffers from such condition. But, it is debatable whether a person suffering from butterflies is afraid to perform, or is only physically uncomfortable with the butterflies and thus does not enjoy performing.\n10. Thus, we can eliminate Choices A and C. \n11. Anxiety (Choice D) is an inappropriate answer for the provided condition, this response could mean physical or mental anxiety that prevents the person from performing. Performing someone talented could be both mentally and physically challenging; however, it is not necessarily an anxiety causing condition. \n12. Happiness (Choice E) only applies to the process of performing and not the talent itself. \n13. If a person does not like performing due to stage fright or performance anxieity, their happiness is irrelevant since their unwillingness to actively perform their talent outweighs whatever sense of happiness they may experience when performing.\n14.

It is common sense that a ratio of 3:1 (three to one) should mean three to one is an incorrect answer.\n3. Since the ratio is 3:1, the answer can only be a multiple of 10.\n4. The correct answer is C: passenger.\n5. There are four (4) cars and four (4) persons.\n6. One of the cars has a single passenger.\n7.

This does not fit the definition since stage fright, which is a psychological disorder, is not necessarily a permanent condition.\n12. Another reason anxiety is the most logical choice is because stage fright is relatively common in performers.\n13. This is because the task of performing in front of an audience places many performers in an uncomfortable situation, which manifests as stage fright symptoms. \n14. Furthermore, 'happiness', Choice E, is not only contradictory to the given definition of a talent person, but also to the definition of stage fright. \n15. This is because 'happiness', as a general psychological condition, suggests someone who is generally content and carefree. \n16. Therefore, stage fright - anxiety - would cause this type of person to feel uneasy in situations that require performing, which contradicts the original intention of being happy without stage fright.\n17. 'Energetic', Choice E, can also be excluded as it's a positive and inaccurate response. \n18. Energy is usually associated with a feeling of excitement, which contrasts with the original intent of avoiding situations that make a person tired and anxious by performing.\n19. Therefore, the most appropriate answer for the question \"When someone is talented but doesn't like to perform, they most likely suffer from...........? Choice D: Stage fright, anxiety.\nAnswer: D \n######", "answer": " 349"}

Choices: 1: to get rid of 2: to stop making stupid 3: to stop being 4: to ignore 5: stop being stupid persons\nRationales: The question is asking for a choice that would benefit the given person. \n1. To get rid of makes it seem as though that the person is getting rid of something bad, which doesn't always result in positive implications. \n2. Since to stop making is implying that the person is making something, perhaps being stupid, which is not true. This option can be disregarded as well. 1. To stop being does not make any sense at all, so the person who asked this question made a mistake when choosing the right options. Since the person being the stupid persons, the correct answer should be to stop being stupid. 2. Thus, the correct answer is to stop being stupid. Answer: E: stop being stupid.\n\nInput: What are the main uses for the sun? Choices:  B: electricity C: warmth D: transportation E: light\nRationales: This question is asking to what uses it is to have the sun. It is a main use because if not there won't be electricity, transportation, warmth, and no light. If we go over the options we see is A: warmth, and that use it's the main use for having sun because electricity (Choice B) needs to have the sun to start working. Also, if it's cloudy, people will not have transportation (choice C) but will be warm (Choice A). Warmth (Choice A) cannot be the main use since people will be warm and they also will have electricity (Choice B). Light (Choice D) comes last it won't make it to be the main use. So therefore, the correct answer is D: transportation.Answer: D transportation.\n\nInput: Somewhere, in 2020, an event occurred", "answer": " 70"}

'Happiness' may not indicate a reluctance or a lack of confidence in performing as many performers may be happy and contented with their abilities despite this not reflecting on how well or skillfully they perform in actual live settings.\n10. However, 'energetic' or some other form of energy-filled emotion can be an indicator for stage fright or performance anxieties.\n11. When these emotions are felt, people may be overly worried or uneasy when they must perform in front of others.

It\u2019s unlikely someone could be described as talent persons cannot suffer from an injury (Choice B), as injury refers to physical incapability, which usually has to do with lack of strength or mobility, but there is no mention about talents in Choice B.\n8. Anxiety (Choice C) and happiness (Choice E) are emotions that may or may not be present when a performer is taking the stage. Anxiety in particular can manifest in situations when the performance hasn\u2019t started yet, as a performer may be nervous or stressed out in anticipation of the event.\n9. Happiness or happinesses aren\u2019t directly relevant to the question because they are states of emotional well-being rather than states of mind. \n10.

There are two possible options for the girl's parents, the mother of the baby girl is either happy (Choice A) or relieved and so is the father (Choice C). However, these are not the answer to the question. There cannot be two happy answers or two relieved answers because that's two different feelings.

{"text": "simply be too afraid to be on stage or in public.\n7. 'Talent persons cannot suffer from injury' (Choice B) makes sense as anyone can suffer an injury or illness, regardless of their talents or special qualities.\n8. Anxiety and happiness (Choice C and D) may refer to emotions associated with performing, however, anxiety is a mental disorder that has nothing to do with emotions while happiness is associated with one's overall mood. Hence, neither of those would indicate the presence of an ailment.\n9. Lastly, 'energetic' does not indicate that someone is sick and instead refers to being physically active and full of energy.\n10. Therefore, the correct answer is C: anxiety. The performer may suffer from anxiety, an instance of performance anxiety, which manifests as fear and concern regarding their performance, among other symptoms. \n11. This can be explained by the fact that stage anxiety is usually accompanied by adverse physical symptoms such as cold sweats, trembling, heart palpitations, and shortness of breath.\n12. These unpleasant sensations make it difficult for the person to focus on their performance and present themselves confidently, leading to poor performance and self-doubt.\n13. Hence, the person suffering from stage anxiety has not merely an injury but also an ailment. \n14. This answer choice choice is also justified, as it is a recognised medical condition that often requires treatment and is characterized by symptoms including fear, worry, and other emotional disturbances.\n15. The performer's fear of performing in front of an audience or on a stage can be attributed to a particular condition known as social anxiety disorder or performance anxiety.\n16. However, if the person can no longer enjoy performing, it could be due to a more general lack of interest or passion, which is more of a personality trait rather than a medical ailment.\nAnswer: C is the correct result of the response.\n\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following question\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: What is a good strategy to use when choosing a strategy?

However, it may not necessarily indicate the presence of a stage fright condition, it could also be a sign of another underlying emotion.\n12. \"Anxiety and injury\" which is an amalgamation of Choices A and C, still makes no sense because \"injury\" would be related to the onset of stage fright and not its persistent occurrence. \n13.

A horse can be known to be calm and well behaved simultaneously, but the correct answer isn't explicitly given.\n2. The horse could be a calm but impolite donkey (Choice B) which is the exact opposite of well mannered (Choice D).\n3. We could assume that 'calm' in this case means 'being without fear or nervousness' instead of 'being still or inactive'.\n4. The question is asking for what 'a horse is'.

For this, we consider the answer Choices: A, C, and E.\nIn the previous solution, a calm and well behaved horse could be A, but this answer is based on the assumption of a calm donkey being one, which is not mentioned. \n6. A calm and well behaved donkey could be B, but that is different from a horse.\n\n7.

This does not accurately represent the real situation, as people learn to cook in many different ways, through courses, via online tutorials, or even self-learning. Hence, this answer is rejected.\nOption D: The answer choice is not specific enough as the cakes are of different kinds. It does not specifically specify the kind of the cake and thus one cannot distinguish between cake learning and bread-specific learning. Moreover, the internet does not only have information about \"different kinds of cakes,\" but it also provides many recipes and tutorials related to cooking, including cakes but not limited to it. Therefore, this option is also not suitable for the question. \nOption E: The answer choice is narrow and provides a one-sided perspective, wherein \"people learn to bake\" by following instructions without any prior experience. This answer choice excludes all other possible learning aspects, such as self-learning, experimentation, and apprenticeship, which are also common methods of acquiring cooking skills.

However, 'energetic' is contradictory to 'anxiety,' and an energetic person in normal condition wouldn\u2019t feel as anxious as someone suffering from anxiety.\n11.

Choices:  the best A: clean B: cleaned C: unclean D: undesirable E: disgusting\nRationales: The question is posed as a question about the quality of the weather. As the focus is on the quality and not the type, the given answer choices should be narrowed down to two: either 'clean' or 'dirty.'\n1. 'Best,' is a descriptive adjective, so it does not apply here.\n2. 'Unclean,' is an adjective to describe something 'dirtier' than clean.\n3. Since the question is asking about quality, this answer choice can be eliminated. \n4. 'Cleaned' is an action verb and does not apply to the quality of the weather's condition.\n5. 'Undesirable' is only an example of adjectives describing the weather and has no role in the decision-making process. \n6. Finally, 'disgusting' is the only answer option that applies, therefore it is the correct answer to the question. \nAnswer: E: disgust\n\nInput: The doctor asked the man what's making you sick?

Energetic (Choice E), does make sense, but it would be difficult to distinguish someone\u2019s level of energy. \n10. Therefore we can cross out choices B and E.\n11.

Anxiety, like performance anxiety, is characterized by a surge in fear, which can significantly impede someone\u2019s enjoyment and enthusiasm.\n13. Performance anxiety, as mentioned before, typically relates to being on stage. This implies that one\u2019s job or task is performing or entertaining.\n14.

Choices: 2: get popcorn  3: have drinks 4: enjoy the credits 5: complain to others about the ending 6: leave in irritation\nRationales:\n1. The question is about what one should do when a movie ends.\n2. The option 'Enjoy the credits' is about enjoying the credits at the end of a film.\n\n3. The options 'leaving in irritation' and 'complaining to others about the ending' are not positive.\n\n4. The option 'getting popcorn' is also a negative action.\n\n5. This leaves option 6 'have drinks' and option 2 'enjoy the credits'.\n\n6. The option 'enjoy the ending' is more useful action as it helps one enjoy the movie more.\n\n7.

Option 4 (A): Stay home is incorrect as introverts may feel lonely and socially isolated as introversion is linked to people who engage in activities rather.\n3. Tendency to want to talk to more familiar people is incorrect for an introvert as a typical introvert only likes to converse with people who they are comfortable with and have known them for a while.

We can see that some of the answer choices are incorrect such as 1: the outside of the loop, 1: the center, 2: a seat, 3: nowhere, 4: the front. \n2. If the horse on the opposite turned around, we don't stand on it, or nowhere, as the horse turns. \n3. 3: nowhere is incorrect. \n4. 5: the front seems to be wrong because the horse can spin around all directions including in the front, if its not moving. \n5.

One would not describe something (like the future) as different if it only has differences (in size, or number, etc.) to another thing (like now). Rather, one would use different to indicate what makes the future different from other time periods.\n3. The options B and D are both wrong, as in each sentence, they use difference to indicate some physical differences between the options (B) now and the future, and (D) people in the future aren'tt so bright and people in the past were not.\n4. 'The future will be different' (Choice A) is too vague to mean anything specific; it's like saying 'the future will be different from some things'. Instead, one would use a more specific statement to describe the future.\n5. 'Many different options' (Choice C) makes no sense either. Although there's a broad range of possibilities in terms of different scenarios that could occur by the time we reach the future, that doesn't mean that the future is filled with many choices.

Happiness (Choice E) isn\u2019t necessarily related to the question as it does not describe negative emotions like aversion or anxiety that are indicative of this condition.\n9. Energetic (Choice E) is inappropriate for the context since the answer is meant to describe someone suffering from a certain mental or emotions state, which can be inferred from the given description, and not describe someone who is physically fit or energetic.\n10.

Likewise, \"Talented persons who perform energetically\" (Choice E) is too specific and does not include the key term \"do not like performing\" given in the question.\n10. \"Talented persons with anxiety\" (Choice D) could also be a plausible response, but we need to ask ourselves: do they enjoy performing or not?\n11.

The words \u201coffensive and defensive\u201d indicate which sides must the term be associated with and to what team or side it refers to. \n1. A squad is not used in sports and refers to a small group of people or small team, which does not make sense in context.\n2.

The option 'talent persons cannot suffer from injury'; though this choice could describe the absence of injury (as it is not a possibility), the word'suffer' is incorrect as someone who is talented is not necessarily suffering from anxiety. \n8.

Choices:  A the cake B the host C the party D the food E the guests\nRationales:\n1. Since the food came from the party, it is likely that the party is where it was prepared/stored. Based on the options presented, the options are: cake (A), the caterer (B), the event host (C) and the food (D) or the party guests (E).\n2. Option 'A', cake, can be excluded, since the food poisoning is not related to the cake alone, but a combination of cake, caterer, host, and other foods at the party.\n3. Option 'B', the caterer is not the appropriate choice, since the caterer may have prepared the food well before the event. This does not necessarily imply he was involved in the party, so it can be disregarded.\n4. Likewise, option 'C', the party host, is incorrect, as it could be a separate individual not directly associated with the preparation or storage of the food, and hence cannot be responsible for food poisoning.\n5. Option 'E', the party guests, does not make any sense; if the food poisoning happened to the guests or the party host, it is not likely to manifest as food poisoning as no food (e.g. the cake", "answer": " 12"}

The human body\nRationales: The question is asking for the two things that make someone 'a person'.\n2. In this context,'make' is used to refer to what'makes' someone a person, that is, their essential qualities or characteristics.\n3. Hence, we can conclude that a person - someone who is a human - is not defined by any or only one of the options given.  \n4. We can eliminate Option A and B. eyebrows and breathing cannot define someone as a person because people with or without them (having or not having eyebrows and/or breathing) are both considered persons or humans.  \n5. Moreover, eyebrows and air cannot be the only essential characteristics that make someone a person because they are not unique to any persons.\n6. Option C states the name as one of the only two things that make someone a person, which also rules it out as a possible answer due to the same reasons. \n7. Furthermore, hair colors are also not unique to a person because one can have two different hair colors (like red and black) just like a person with two hair colors (like black and blond) are both considered 'people'.

At a glance, the question asks about things or activities happening in the first quarter that could lead an opponent to consider calling it quits.\n2. Choice 1 - playing in the first quarter: Playing the first quarter means the team would have been in the first quarter, so any further game after that would no longer be the first quarter.\n3. Choice 2 - the best they can: The best they can means the team was unable to lead an opponent or win the game.\n4.

C\u2013 refers to a situation where someone is not arrested, but does not have to face the officer.\n5. D\u2013 implies that Derek was faced with an officer, and therefore could not commit a crime and then run away.\n6. In E: \"the other people in the area are the only ones who would help him\", the helper referred to refers to people who are in Derek's area, and would help him to escape from the police.\n7. This does not directly apply to why Derek is so afraid of getting arrested.\n8. Hence Option \"there was an officer in front him\" is the most appropriate choice.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: What should you do before a big match?

Likewise, feeling excited (Choice E) does not always indicate performance anxiety or stage fright as it is a broad and subjective term.\n10. Choice C, anxiety, is definitely the best option, because it fits the description.\n11.

Choices:  Q: Do not call this a comeback A: I have nothing to say B: It's a comeback C: I'm only a comeback D: It is over for me E: I am nothing\nRationales:1. The question is about what the phrase \"don' fall it a comeback means.\n2. The phrases \"It is over, I'm only a commecback, nothing,\" don't seem to make sense, as they are more like reponses and do not follow in the right order.\n3. \"Over for me,\" doesn't make sense, as someone can't be over or for someone else.\n4. \"I'm only a comback\" doesn't make any sense at all, which makes out of the options that this can be ruled out as the correct answer.\n5. \"Don't call this a commecback\" is the right answer because it has the right order or the right choice.\n6. The correct answer, which is choice D: Don't call this a comebak, is the choice which has the right order or correct choice to be a comeback, which means that is what it means: don't call it comeback because it is not an appropriate phrase at all to say what the phrase of meaning.\n7.

Hiking (B) will not be the correct answer because it is physical and requires energy so it is not easy to do.\n2. Flying (D) is also physical and also does not provide enough information to deduce that that person can do that with ease.\n3. Writing (E) is something that someone has probably done with ease in the recent past and one could easily infer from the question that this person wanted somebody experienced with ease which is why writing will not be the correct choice.\n4.

This exclusionary phrase seems too broad and it appears that anxiety (Choice C), whereby the presence of anxiety can prevent someone from performing, is more plausible than the other choices.\n10.

This can lead to physical symptoms like an increased heartbeat, sweating, and difficulty in breathing that may interfere with performing. \n9. Similarly, happiness (Choice E) would only occur if a person does like performing and enjoy engaging in the activity.\n10.

The question is asking for the option that can be used to transport the brush.\n3. A table is not appropriate as it is not a transport medium.\n4. A shovel may be used to move the brush, but it is more appropriate to use a wheelbarrow as it can be used as a container for the brush as well.\n5.

However, we know that most people with performance anxiety are uncomfortable instead of happy when performing.\n9.

Choices:  A) common, B) personal, C) important, D) private, E) public\nRationales: Choosing an appropriate option from the answers will depend on a context and the meaning of a certain word in the question.\nIn the original sentence, the word \u2018__________\u2019 means that an event is public, so when choosing options for what a common event is, one should keep this in mind:\nOption A: Common events happen every day and are well known \u2013 this makes them public.\nOption B: There is nothing private about some common events \u2013 this makes their event public.\nOption C: All common events are important to one individual or a group. But an event may be important to any member of the general public.\nOption D: Events may be important to any group or individual. But an event may not be important to any member or subset of the general public. This makes an event private.\nOption E: Since public events are important to the general public, an event is public if it is important to the general public. This option must cover a certain time period, and not a single moment.\nThus, the meaning of the word public is simple \u2013 it is something that is known to the public. So, the event here cannot be private, because being private means it is known to the people, and not the general public.\nSince public events are important to a certain subset of the public, an event may be considered public even if is important to a subset, rather than to the general public. \nThus, options B and E are the most suitable answers for this question.

The question states that if someone is able to drive, then they are qualified to drive.  2. By definition and common usage of the terms, a qualified person is one who possesses the necessary abilities, knowledge, and other qualities to do a certain thing.\n3. They would qualify to drive if they can drive. According to the question, the person who is able to drive would then be qualified to drive or a qualified driver.\n4. If a person is incapable of performing a task like driving, then they wouldn\u2019t be able to drive.\n5.

Choices: \tA: lower grades because you will be caught B: remain the same C: a few points D: higher grades E: stay the same\nRationales: It can be stated that each student has a few options when they cheat on an exam - they can be caught or not. If they do get caught, they will be subject to a penalty or a punishment. This punishment may be lowered grades or a failing grade.\nIt can be concluded that cheating can lead to lowered grades. This is true in the option A because if you cheat, your grades will lower.\nAlternatively, if you successfully cheat it can lead to no changes in your grades - remaining at the same level as it was before the cheating occurred. The option C,'remain the same', can fit this description as you may not get caught or punished.\nLikewise, if you end up getting caught, it could be a minor infraction or a situation where you are not reprimanded. Hence, both the options A and C can be eliminated because they are incompatible with each other.\nOption B, 'lower grades because you will get caught', does not match the criteria either as it only talks about getting caught and not getting away with the cheating.

There is a possibility that the pronouns might be used to refer to another person, object, or place. Therefore, these must be taken into consideration.\n\nIn this case, personal pronouns were used correctly, so all the answer choices must be evaluated based on the relationship between the ball and the hand.\n\nLook at the relation between 'ball' and 'hand'.\nThere are only two possible relationships possible, direct and indirect.\nDirect: one party is in contact with another party meaning that the ball is in hand.\n\nDirect relationship - In this case, the ball is in hand\n\nIndirect: one party is not in contact with another party while another party in between them is in contact with the object.\n\nThis relationship cannot be used for the correct answer because indirect relationships cannot give you the answer.\n\nHence, if: one is in contact with another, or one is not in contact with one party and in contact with another party, then it must be a direct relationship. In most cases, they both are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, as a direct relationship exists between ball and hand, it is indirectly in the hand. Since indirect relationship cannot be used, the answer is A - the ball is in hand since if the ball is in hand, then the hand must exist.

Choice: A. refrigerator B. fruit C. garden tree D. kitchen E. store\nRationales: The given options is A. refrigeratot B. fruit c. garden tree d. kitchen E. store. The question is asking us to select a correct response from among the given choices which can be found in a refrigerator. \nAn apple is a fruit (Choice C) therefore it could be found in a garden tree(Choice B).\nSince a refrigerator does not contain fruits like apples, it cannot be found in the refrigerator.\nSimilarly, we can eliminate choices A and E as they do not contain the fruit apple.\nWe can also eliminate choices B and C as they do not contain anything.\nHence, out of the given choices, the answer is D which contains apples in fruits trees.\nAnswer: D. fruit tree\n\nInput: A small dog or a medium dog which breed is more common?

The options given are walking, driving, standing, waiting, and going. As it can be observed, the options are in contrast to each other, as they do not have one common feature.\n2. For instance, going is a physical action, and a person can go anywhere in any means of transportation. For example, they can go by walking, biking, driving, or taking a train or car.\n3. Moreover, a person can go either before or after buying a car.\n4. Walking, then, seems the only sensible answer because it's a state of being that remains the same regardless of when a person buys it.\n5. Going is an activity, not a state of being, hence, the most apt answer is walking.\n6. Walking makes the most sense in this context as the man bought the car and was in a state of walking around, that is, he was walking the entire night.\n7.

Additionally, not all performers are talented individuals, and people who possess extraordinary talent may feel a sense of joy and accomplishment in what they are able to do; this feeling could be referred to as 'happiness' (Choice E). So, they suffer from joy rather than unhappiness.\n7. 'Energetic' (Choice E) is an interesting possibility, but it's unclear which part of being a performer suffers from this condition, i.e., the person or the act of performing. \n8. 'Butterflies' (Choice B) is a commonly attributed symptom of stage fright. This is likely due to the fear of embarrassment, self-consciousness, and failure. \n9. This condition makes it difficult to focus, and one may experience distractions or mental fog, in addition, one may feel a sense of intense internal or external pressure, which may be accompanied by nervousness or physical symptoms such as rapid heart rate, tremors, or sweating.\n10. The mental and emotional strain caused by stage fright can lead to anxiety (Choice C), which, according to psychology, is an important factor in determining whether someone will have issues performing on stage.\n11. 'Happiness' (Choice D), while a desirable state of being, is not an appropriate answer as being happy about performing doesn't reflect the reluctance of someone suffering from stage fright. \n12.

Anxiety (Choice C) can cause people to experience intense feelings of dread or panic as they approach an activity that could put their skills to test, such as performing in front of an audience.\n9. While one might suffer from anxiety, they can still enjoy performing even with it being a disadvantage.\n10. Happiness (Choice D) doesn\u2019t sound like something that could hinder someone from enjoying what they are good at.\n11. However, happiness doesn't mean that a person enjoys a given activity and that's why it can't be an answer choice.\n12. The remaining one, energetic (Choice E), is an adjective that means full of energy or vitality, vigorous, strong. Though this can describe someone who enjoys performing, we need to rule this out as an option. \n13. Energetic is not necessarily equivalent to enjoying performing; it means that someone is full of energy and that doesn't necessarily mean that they like or enjoy performing.\n14. An energetic person might not necessarily be afraid of performing in front of others and this means that an energetic person cannot suffer from anxiety.\n15.

The question is about what steps one typically takes when researching a topic for a report.\n2. The given choices are: interviewing an expert, writing the report myself, reading the report, going to the library, and talking to people who workout.\n3. Going to the library or reading up on something is not considered a step one has to take if they want to write an in-depth report about the benefits of hot springs for athletics. \n4.

Choices: 1: got an Uber 2: went on a date 3: paid for a parking space 4: went by walking 5: took the theater bus\nRationales:1. The question is, \"what did I do?\".\n2. This question asks for an event rather than a state of being.\n3. Uber, paying for a parking space, and walking are all forms of transportation, whereas 'going on a date' and 'taking the theater bus' are not methods of transportation.\n4. Option 1 (got an Uber): is eliminated as it is a form of transportation that is different from the question at hand.\n5. Option 2 (went on a date): is also eliminated since the answer options are given explicitly and cannot be assumed as an option.\n6. Option 3 (paid for a parking space): is not consistent with the given question. It may seem logical to assume that you\u2019d pay for a parking space once you find one, but the actual question is what you did before not after.\n7. Option 4 (went by walking): we understand that not all theatres have parking around them. It might be common sense that you\u2019d walk there if the parking was not feasible. It is not relevant to the actual question.\n8. Lastly, we have option (5) (took the theater bus) but the worded question is specific to a parking spot, so we can eliminate it.\n9.

This condition refers to the feeling of butterflies or anxiety or being nervous when performing in front of an audience.\n11. These feelings typically accompany performance/stage anxiety, in addition, to worrying about how you/your performance will be received.\n12.

The options are: \"nice\", \"polite\", \"complete stranger\", \"friendly\", \"shy\", \"rude\".\n2. The given options are describing various behavioral or emotional states of the person.\n3. \"Friendly\" doesn't necessarily mean that the person is a friend or familiar to you, therefore, this can be eliminated. \n4. \"Nice\" is defined as an affable quality or being amiable. Hence, 'nice stranger' is not the accurate phrase to use as it's the opposite of the intended meaning.\n5. The intended statement 'kind person' would usually suggest a certain degree of friendliness, so it is a candidate for the answer.\n6.

Choices: 1) are ready to order. 2) you aren't coming with me 3) you are coming with me 4) the restaurant wasn't crowded. 5) I was eating\nRationales: Explanation to answer: 1. The sentence: I will be waiting for You are incomplete grammatically as 'I' can't be waiting for 'you' in the present continuous tense as 'you' is singular and 'I' is singular, whereas we wait for each other in the plural form.\n2. As the sentence implies 'you' coming, therefore sentence means 'you and I' not 'you'.\n3. Choice 2 is grammatically acceptable as the sentence says we will be waiting for 'you and I' instead of 'you'.\n4. The sentence: The restaurant wasn't crowed grammatically wrong as the verb 'to be' has to be in the base form here, and \"wasn't\" has to be used instead of \"weren't\".\n5. The sentence: I was eating grammatically correct as the subject of the sentence is I i.e., \"I\" will be eating.\n\nInput: My grandma's favorite crayons were red and blue.

Choices:  X: ice A: wood B: concrete C: brick D: sand\nRationales: The question is ambiguous. Although the answer choices are given here, one can decide based on the given constraints on this task.\n\n1. It is given that the house must be built. However, no other constraints have been provided so far. Hence, answer A can be selected as a possible option.\n2. Apart from being a structure with some or another roofing over it, the houses constructed in the tundra are designed for survival and not for comfort or luxury.\n3. They are typically smaller and less aesthetically designed, the choices B and C are thus inappropriate as they are more suited to larger constructions. Hence, answer D can be considered as a possible answer option.\n4. D: sand is not an appropriate choice since the sand at the tundra is frozen and used by people to make trails. \n5. Moreover, sand is used as construction material for more aesthetically designed structures, which would not be appropriate for the tundra environment.\n6. Hence answer B: ice can be considered for this option. Therefore, the answer that fits", "answer": " 117"}

Choices: 1: Judging a case and listening to an argument 2: Hearing cases and listening to arguments 3: Making a ruling on the case 4: Providing for the security of the law\nRationales: The question asks which of the four mentioned functions is part of the judicial branch.\n1. Judging a case and hearing cases and listening to arguments (choices 1 and 2) only happen in court, as both these functions require the presence of courtroom officials and litigants who are all there based on case.\n2. Hence they're not part of the judicial function.\n3. Making a ruling (choice 3) is the judges' job, who are a part of the judicial.\n4. Providing for the security (choice 4) is done by the government, to ensure the safety and order of communities, and their ability to work, etc, which again does not fall under the judicial branch. Hence choice 4 can be eliminated. \n5. Based on this, the functions that are part of the four branches of government are judging a case and listening/arguing (two functions), which the judicial branch does, thus answer 3 is right.\nAnswer: 3: Making the ruling", "answer": " 6"}

A person could suffer from excessive or uncontrollable energy and enthusiasm, which could manifest in various forms including a strong enthusiasm for performing and taking part in events, shows, concerts, etc.\n9. However, the most probable explanation for the statement is fear or anxiety (B). This is supported by the description that \u201ctalent persons cannot suffer from injury but can suffer from anxiety\u201d, which indicates that the writer is referring to fear and anxiety as something that can be suffered from, which directly contradicts a condition that \u201cpeople suffering from anxiety cannot suffer from injury\u201d, therefore indicating that the statement refers to people who can be anxious and suffer from anxiety as a whole.\n10.

Green and brown are associated with jealousy. Yellow is the color of cheerfulness which contradicts a mellow yellow moment, hence its unlikely to be a match. \n5. The colors purple, brown, and blue are associated with sadness and depression. \n6. Yarn (Choice D), the opposite of purple, is unrelated to the mood. \n7.

Choices: A: organize B: separate documents by date and content C: consult a professor D: look for details in the document E: find what is needed\nRationales: The question involves organizing documents; the correct answer could be in terms of organizing the documents or, a logical order of looking through the documents.\n1. We have already selected the right option, but let's also analyze each option further -\n    A: organize (choice A) suggests arranging things systematically, which is not a requirement based on the question statement.

We know that \"grief\" is a synonym for stress or worry, so we should be looking for something that might cause frustration/stress/anxiety.\nGiven the context, Option D is the most fitting as it is a way in which we might refer to a boss.

Additionally, having something as abstract as a lot of \u2018happiness\u2019 (Choice E) doesn\u2019t necessarily mean someone wouldn\u2019t enjoy performing because of it. Happiness only affects a person\u2019s general well-being but does not refer to any specific thoughts or feelings.\n9.

This leaves us with two options, anxiety (Choice C) and energetic (Choice E).\n11. Anxiety (Choice C) definitely fits into the context as a fearful emotion that can be experienced in any situation and is a perfect description for stage fright or performance anxieties.\n12. Energetic (Choice E) seems a bit odd in this context as someone may still enjoy or perform even if they are energetic. \n13.

The given choices refer to certain sports, such as football, American football, soccer, baseball, and cricket.\n2. Now, it makes sense to analyze the context of the question.\n3. 'In which game do the referees raise flag to signal the end' implies that a referee's position is to stop or pause the game play, which signifies the end of the game.\n4. Given the option of 'American football' (choice B), the referee does not raise the flag to signal that the game has ended. Instead, they hold it up to signal that a penalty has been given.\n5.

'Cricket' (choice E), the referee doesn' to stop play to signal the end of it.\n7.

Choice D talks about being happy and enjoying yourself, but that does not indicate fear or anxiety in performing.\n10. And lastly, Choice E is ambiguous since it doesn\u2019t mention any connection directly with being happy or energetic, rather it indicates an inability to perform (lack of talent or ability).

Let's go over all the given options:\n        [noun]: a person, animal, place, thing, substance, or quality. In this question, as a person is the only one being discussed, so the correct choice must be noun or person.\n        [shape]: something with physical features such as lines, angles, curves, and positions related to a specific object or form of an object.\n        [color]: the spectrum of light emitted from certain objects.\n        [colorblindness]: a condition in which there is a reduced ability to distinguish colors.\n        [shapeshifter]: an individual or being that can change shape or take part in animal shapes.\n        [animal]: a living organism of a particular species or type that feeds by predation on other animals or on vegetable matter.\n        [sentient]: exhibiting awareness of one's own existence and situation.\nThus, the correct choice among this lot must be either noun or shape as shape is a specific object or form, and not a person.

Option D: razor can be eliminated because a razor is more commonly associated with removing hair from beards or similar body hair. \n4. Likewise, option E: beard can also be eliminated because the context of the question is referring to someone who is in the shower.\n5.

E is also excluded because, while it is true that humans do not like to cause suffering in other people with whom they are close, such as with family and friends, that is not the reason that humans go without food.      \n7.So, the only plausible answer is option B: They like to harm others.\n8.This choice is the most plausible option for several reasons;\n9.We know that the vast majority of people do not like to cause harm to others to the point where they will go hungry for prolonged periods of time.\n10.Only a very small minority of people in the world are known to do so, for example, by not eating and drinking because they would feel happier", "answer": " 7"}

E: Temperature continues to cool \nRationales: Consider 1 & 2: 'A: Heat is being released from the Earth' and 'B: It isn\u2019t actually falling because it\u2019s just rising' both describe global warming which occurs after winter and not change in the seasons. The season of fall happens after winter, so this information makes no sense in this context.\n3. In terms of 3:'C: It means the season changing' explains what will happen. Remember that the question was asking about what happens when the temperature starts cooling down. The given statement about the changes in the season means that fall will happen. \n4. In 4: 'D: The Rate of cooling becoming slower' explains how long it would take for the fall to happen.\n5. The correct one is 5: 'E: Temperature continues as cooling'.

Since this is a group of children camped together, they may be bored because of the limited activities and recreation they have at the camp.\n3. They may then decide to create a game on their own, as an active and engaging activity.\n4.

The question would be asking about what an astronaut does, and since an astronaut is not in space very much, the question would pertain to tasks that astronauts perform while on earth.\n\nThe following questions will be on the space astronaut\u2019s duties.\nC) have a job that\u2019d be dangerous and not sending people to space, is not a valid choice since an astronaut is a person who travels in space to explore or do experiments. Astronauts don\u2019t really do anything dangerous.\n\nThe phrase \u201cfind new ways to sending people to space\u201d, refers to the astronauts on earth since the people that are going to space do not send future astronauts.\n\nThe phrase\u201d find new ways to send astronauts to space\u201d would be appropriate if the question asked about astronauts while in space.\n\nE", "answer": " 2240"}

Choices: 1 A: oak tree; 2 B: pine tree; 3 C: elm; 4 D: rosebush; 5 E: bone briar\nRationales: The correct answer is that most of these are not suitable to be planted in a landscape or a park.\n1. Elm tree is an option, however it\u2019s a tree species and doesn\u2019t qualify as a plant.\n2. Rosebush is an option, but it\u2019s a flowering plant that can\u2019t grow as tree and does not fit the description \u201cplant\u201d in the question.\n3. Bone briar is a bushy plant but as mentioned in the question, it needs shady place with moist, rich loam soil.\n4. Oak tree is an option, but an oak tree is a tree and therefore doesn\u2019t qualify plant in the question.\n5. Bone briars needs shady, rich loam soil while pine tree requires loam, moist soil.\n6. Pine tree is also an option, pine tree is a conifer and qualifies as a plant but needs loam, moist rich soil.\n7.

Choices:  a) stress b) relief c) shocked d) happy e) worried\nRationales: Option A. This question is asking about what a new employee may likely feel when they start working at new institution. \n1. The options are likely to be stress, relief, shocked, happy and worried.\n2. This question may be related to a newly recruited employee who has just taken a job role at a new organization.\n3. The options Stress and relief are highly possible scenarios that may happen at any point during the employee\u2019s employment.\n4.

A: Turn around in the stream\n2. B: Return to where it once was\n3. C: Follow the stream\n4. D: Head straight to the sea\n5. E: Eat the shark that tries to eat you\nRationales: The question is regarding a fish that is swimming upstream and suddenly notice that its body is not shaping out the way it should.\nThe answer will be based on how the fish should proceed.\nFrom the options, we can infer that the fish is swimming up river after being trapped in it.\nWe can determine this from the following logic: It can't go on either side of the river, and there is no water source on either end of the river.\nEither it has to return back down river or go into the sea.\nTherefore, if the fish decides to turn left then it will start swimming down the river again, to complete the loop.\nIf it turns right then it should continue swimming down the river, to complete the loop, and end up in the same location, it was before.\nAs that may not be a good choice, we can determine the answer by exclusion.\nOption 'E' does not fit the given situation as there is no shark on either end of the fish's location.\nWe can also conclude option 'C' as it does not sound possible as there is no way for the fish to swim in any direction as there is no more water in any direction.\nhence, the answer will be 'D,' as it can head straight to the sea after realizing that its body is not the shape.\n\nAnswer: D: Head straight to sea.", "answer": " 80"}

However, being happy about performing isn\u2019t how stage fright can be identified.\n10. Similarly, being energetic is not a distinguishing characteristic of someone who has stage fright.\n11.

In the context of this question, an injury (Choice A), butterflies (Choice B), and emotional reaction (Choice C) are not the focus, rather it is a mental or emotional condition (Choice D - E).\n10. Hence, it can safely be established that the solution is either choice D: Anxiety or E: Energetic.\n11. A possible reason for anxiety is that the performer fears not performing well or disappointing the audience.\n12. Similarly, performing causes anxiety since it's a strenuous process and causes fatigue or anxiety from the stage or spotlight.\n13.

'people who made the vase' is the closest choice because the 'vase' is not the entity being represented by the people who made it.\n2. Looking at the other choices in the question: \n  1.

As per the given information, if she was scared in her sleep, it\u2019s likely they\u2019re referring to the future.\n3.

It is clear that 'going' has nothing to do with the sentence.  Going to 'do' things like 'the concert', 'the movie', and 'the gym' isn't what we need.  This is an action done by someone and therefore the answers for this are B,C and D, but as I was typing this I noticed that the wording of B,C, and D all make sense but not in the sentence.

Therefore, option C: anxiety is the most appropriate answer, as it is a common condition among people who do not enjoy performing.\nAnswer: C1: anxiety\n\nInput: What can possibly cause someone to laugh out loud when they may not even find something funny? Choices: 1. A: depression 2. B: confusion 3. C: happiness 4. D: nervousness 5. E: embarrassment\nRationales:1. The meaning of the question can be summarized as: A: A person laughing does not necessarily be funny, it could be caused by other factors.\n2. Let's understand each answer option.\n3. Depression (Choice A): laughter is not an inherent trait of a depressed person but rather an indication of an over-stimulated nervous system. A depressed person is generally known to have a low mood rather than intense physical reactions.\n4. Confusion (Choice B): confused people do not laugh out loud when they are confused but rather they may cry, scream, or get into a panic mode.\n5. Happiness (Choice C): a person laughing indicates a feeling of joy or pleasure. Generally, laughing may co-occur with happiness.\n6. Nervousness (Choice D): a laughing person may be nervous or scared, but it doesn'ta necessarily indicate those feeling.\n7.

It would be more appropriate in situations where the person would feel a strong energy or enthusiasm that would lead them to enjoy the experience of performing. In this case, the performer is suffering because they feel lack of energy and no enthusiasm for the activity they were performing. So, the best outcome for the performer is to gain the needed confidence before performing without the feeling of anxiety, which we can relate to feeling energetic.\nSo, the best answer is that a person suffering talent might feel anxiety.\nAnswer: B: talent person cannot suffer from injury and worry\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following set of general knowledge questions.\n\n### Answers:\n\n<div class=\"answers\">\n\t<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" border=\"1\" style=\"padding:6px;border:none\">\n\t\t<tbody>\n\t\t\t<tr class=\"answer\"  style=\"color: #8B8B8B;background-color: #FFFFFF; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold\">\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;\">1. &nbsp;What is the name for an organized body of knowledge?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t        <strong><img class=\"answers\" style=\"background-color: #c6c6c6; font-family: cursive; font-size:14px;", "answer": " 670"}

Happiness and energetic (Choices C and E), while being good qualities, don\u2019t make clear connections to anxiety, as they are both positive emotions that don\u2019t necessarily align to the negative connotations that would normally be associated with stage fright.\n9. This leaves anxiety and happiness with two similar qualities that is the presence of positive emotions that indicate a state of being happy or relaxed.\n10. However, they both have different meanings when they are looked carefully at. While happiness is a more specific quality, anxiety is a more general quality.\n11. Anxiety can have different connotations depending on what it is referring to, for example in the context of performing in front of others, an anxiety is a severe feeling of unease and nervousness that is experienced only when thinking about certain situations.\n12. Happiness, on the other hand, does not have to specifically refer to performing. \n13. In conclusion, Choice D: anxiety is the most appropriate answer. \n14.

We know that the teacher teaches math differently, the choices are R: different, A: boring, B: difficult, C: challenging, D: interesting, E: easy.\n2. The main difference between the given answers can be observed with respect to the tone and manner in which the teacher delivers the courses.\n3. For example, the teacher R: different teaches using a very different approach than what is normally used. In contrast, the teacher B: difficult teaches math using methods that would challenge and even frustrate those who aren\u2019t familiar with them.\n4.

The other answer choices are not logically consistent.\n3. Being at home should not be considered a valid place to be because it is a personal space (Option A) and work (option B) is not considered a person's own space.\n4. Being at school (Option C) is not a relevant option because being happy requires being in a positive environment. A school is not typically known for being an excellent place to be happy.\n5. The zoo would be an unlikely place to be happy because it is an area crowded with people, animals, and sounds. This is not a space where one would typically feel happy.\n6.

If they are swimming in the ocean, (Choice B, Water temperature), they don't need to worry about which kind of sunscreen they use.\n2. If they are not in a pool, the person is probably swimming in the ocean and needs to use sunscreen (Sunbath).\n3. If they are in a pool, choosing among all options is not difficult.\n4. They simply need to pay attention to how to protect their skin and to other people in a pool (Other pool goers).\n5. When swimming in the ocean is different because it can be dangerous.\n6.

Looking closely at the response options, we can analyze their suitability based on the considerations mentioned above.\n6. Choice A: coffee - Since coffee is commonly consumed during an informal situation, coffee may not be the best answer. \n7. Choice B: water - This would be the best answer since drinking water is usually associated with an informal setting.\n8. Choice C: wine - This would not be an appropriate answer since this beverage is typically enjoyed during a formal social occasion such as a wedding or dinner. \n9.

In conclusion, we can confidently answer B (Choice B): talent persons cannot suffer from the injuries and butterflies. \n13. Additionally, a talent person with a talent may not suffer from injury or 'butterflies' since they can perform, but they could be suffering from anxiety or similar condition as being fearful or nervous.\n14.

B states that pneumonia is An infection of the space between the chest and lungs which is incorrect. C states \"An infection of one or more lungs\" this is untrue as any infection in the lungs can be classified as pneumonia.\nWe can eliminate the \"E: None Of The Above\" as this option does not even match with the question asking what pneumonia is. \nChoices A and D can definitely be eliminated based on the descriptions provided in B and C which is incorrect, incorrect, not the answer choices. \nSo the answer must be \"C: An infection of both or one of the lungs\".\nAnswer: C: Infection of both or one (either one", "answer": " 360"}

Choices:  (A) Avoiding conflict (B) Giving the driver my license and registration (C) Slamming on my brakes (D) Not intervening (E) Confronting with fists\nRationales: The question asks if you are walking down the street when you witness a situation. There is a car arguing with kids and in the middle, the car squeezes another car causing damage to it. The question then asks what should you do.\n1. As you walk down the street, you hear a scream coming out of the car ahead. You notice two kids arguing in a hostile manner, and you decide to intervene. \n2. There are two conflicting answer choices- \u2018Avoiding conflict:\u2019 you can do that by avoiding the situation, but not intervening is not an option.\n3. \u2018Not intervening\u2019 is also an invalid choice as it could result in a conflict on the street. \n4. Between \u2018Confronting with fists\u2019 and \u2018Slamming on my brake,\u2019 the former would be a valid response of intervening, but the latter would be more reasonable as it will avoid potential conflict and protect your personal safety.\nAnswer: Confronting with fist is a sensible option. \n\nInput: According to an article, ketchup has more than 20 ingredients including sugar and tomato paste because a: it's easy to digest b: it'", "answer": " 18"}

Anxiety\n\nInput: Every time we get together, I am always late! What's with that? Choices: \tA: You are always running late, but never early. B: You're not very trustworthy. C: You're always leaving early. D: I'm always on time. E: You are always leaving early.\nRationales:1.The question asks for the rationale why 'I'm always late'.\n2. We can answer this question in two steps. First, understand the meaning of the given sentences 'You are always leaving early.' and 'I'm always on time.' 'You are always leaving Early.' is explained by the word 'always'. This gives an indication that 'I'm always leaving early' is an exaggerated or an incomplete statement. The word 'I'm' is wrongly used to show possessiveness while talking about someone. 'I'm' should be replaced with 'I' to complete the sentence properly. This leaves us with 'I'm leaving early' as the only valid response.\n3. The second understanding is from 'You're not very trust worthy.' This indicates that the person who answered this question is not very trustworthy, hence the response provided.\n4. 'you are always running Late' and 'You're are always running late' are different.\n5", "answer": " 3600"}

The statement, 'talent persons cannot suffer from injuries and butterflies', refers to a rare and previously undocumented condition where a talented person does not experience performance anxiety or worry.\n8. This means that this condition may be invalid for the above question, thus eliminating one correct answer. \n9. An \u2018anxiety\u2019 (Choice B) is similar to the given condition i.e., performance anxiety, which is the feeling of nervousness, stress, and worry in situations that require a public performance - either in front of peers or a crowd of people.\n10. A \u2018happiness\u2019 (Choice C) wouldn\u2019t necessarily correlate with the given condition, meaning a talented person may be happy in performing.\n11. A \u2018energetic\u2019 (Choice D) isn\u2019t an appropriate response as \u2018energetic\u2019 implies abundance of energy that is not related to performance. \n12. Hence, the most plausible answer is that a talent person who doesn\u2019t like performing suffers from performance anxiety - a common issue among all performers and creatives.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: If it's rainy outside, you should probably what? Choices: A: drink and watch movies B: buy something C: leave D: play football E: walk the dog\nRationales: The question asks the choice that one should consider after the weather turns bad and it starts raining.\nWeather is a common phenomenon to experience, so the choice of a suitable activity in such situations should ideally be known to the general populace.\n1. Choices A, B, and C are unlikely to represent the most appropriate activities to engage in on a rainy day, based on the common knowledge of what people prefer to do on a rainy day.\n2. 'Drinking and watching movies' (Choice B) seems like a great way to relax or cope on a rainy day but doesn't imply any physical activity.\n3. Leaving to buy stuff doesn't necessarily require any activity and 'playing football' (Choice D) also doesn't make much sense for this context as it would likely be dangerous to engage in if there is a possibility of a storm.\n4.

It generally refers to a feeling of nervousness or excitement and not always to pain.\n9. Only anxiety (Choice D) aligns with the description, as it is an emotional or mental condition commonly experienced by people with stage fright and other related conditions.\n10. Accordingly, the most appropriate answer choice is anxiety.\n11. Thus, talent persons cannot suffer the most talented but doesn't like performance, they probably suffer from anxiety.

Therefore, the reason that Heather's answer and the answer of others was so different because Heather is really different from others.\n3. All the given answer choices are false because they cannot be seen differently. \n4. Choices D: he had just asked by someone what he most wanted in life does not make sense at all. The person was not Heather who was playing in the street. Heather cannot be asked by this person what he most wanted.\n5. Choices E: he had been asking how the day was going.

The question reads: 'I'm', which means the answer might have a 'is' or 'isn't'.\n2. 'thinking' is an action verb, so this sentence suggests that it is an action that one is performing, it is not a statement.\n3. 'about' implies that this sentence doesn't refer to the action of counting, for example, but rather to someone thinking in general about counting.\n4. The next clause reads: \"2+3=5\", which means adding one and three, then multiplying the result with five.\n5. This is not a real statement. It is a problem statement or a math sentence.\n6.

Choices D and E state the response 'that', it is the most appropriate response according to this sentence.\n2. Choice A states 'I', and this does not make sense as part of the response that follows.\n3. Choice B states 'enjoy', for 'enjoy', it would normally follow with the pronoun 'I'. However, it does not have any context to use it that way.\n4. Choice C: 'a lot', is a noun that describes an amount or quality of 'too much'.

Choice F: 'that' fits the most closely and is the correct response.\nAnswer: F: that\n\nInput: Why would it rain less in a desert town? Choices: 1. A: The desert is cooler 2.

We don't know what talent the person in question has to judge if they are talented or not.\n9. 'Happiness' (Choice D) doesn't describe someone who avoids or dislikes performing. It can just mean they are content with their performance on stage.\n10. 'Energetic' (Choice E) can describe someone who is energetic, but we don't know if that energy is positive or negative. Even though this could be an option, it can be concluded that someone who is very energetic but doesn't like being on stage probably suffers from performance anxiety or stage fright.\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer for the question is anxiety.\nAnswer: D : Anxiety\n\nInput: When the lightning strikes what is the sound that is most likely made?

However, lightning can make different sounds, and we will try to find out the correct response that applies to a lightning strike, not a thunderbolt.\n3. The other options: 'click' (Choice D), 'a thud' (Choice B), and 'a click' (Choice E) don't describe the sound of lightning.\n4.

Therefore, none of these options can be selected for the correct answer.\n9. However, one clue could possibly be found by looking at the remaining choices, E and B.\n10.

Choices: \n A: Not being eligible B: Not having a valid document C: Losing a voting certificate D: Missing the election day\nRationales:\n 1. A person must meet certain eligibility criteria to be eligible to vote in an election.\n 2. The term 'disqualified' in the question would indicate that someone is not eligible to vote, resulting in their disqualification. \n 3. The choices under consideration don\u2019t necessarily reflect the process of voting eligibility.\n 4. For instance, Choice A, Not being eligible, would indicate that someone is already eligible enough in most cases but is not eligible enough to vote because he/she doesn't meet other specific requirements. Choice B is another option that states, 'Not having a valid document.'\n 5. This option states that you need a valid document, such as a passport or a driver\u2019s license in most countries, to vote.\n 6. Option C, Losing a voting certificate means you have already lost your right to vote if you had a voting certificate to begin with. This is not typically enough to disqualify anyone from voting.\n 7. Answer choice D, Missing the election day, indicates the possibility of voting outside the specified date of the election.\n 8. In some cases such as emergencies, people can actually vote on election day by asking for special permission from the election commissions in their country.\n 9. In many cases, even missing the date of an election has no negative effect on a person\u2019s eligibility to vote.\n 10. Thus, only option", "answer": " 504"}

The choices listed are ears, eyes, nose, brain, and mouth.\n2. We can eliminate choice 'ears, eyes, and nose', because a person should be able to communicate with just the brain and the mouth with the eyes working in assisting with the latter.\n3. Choice A, B: two ears and a month, states that a person should have a pair of ears and a mouth for the purpose of communication. \n4. Choice B: the brain, would contradict the statement above in which there should be two ears and a mouth.\n5. Choice C: two eyes and nose, implies that the nose contributes to communication but that the eyes do not, in which this is not the case.\n6. Therefore, choice A and C are contradicting.\n7.

Energetic (Choice B) may refer to a person being energetic and enthusiastic about performing but it is more likely not to be a condition but a positive indicator of their enthusiasm.\n10. Anxiety (Option D) seems the most plausible as a fit, but there are several other mental conditions that may also fit the description.\n11. The options happiness and energetic also do not seem to suggest stage fright, but an affirmative state of enjoyment or high energy.\n12. Hence, we need to rule out the plausible negative conditions first, before further analyzing the more positive conditions.\n13. Analyzing the condition that someone with talent may suffer from, butterflies (Choice C) doesn't make sense.\n14. Hence, it can be eliminated. Also, energy (Choice B) can be eliminated because even if someone is energetic, that wouldn't have to mean that they enjoy performing as someone can be energetic and active in other fields, such as sports.\n15.

We start by considering the given options and eliminating those that don't make sense.\n2. Loss (Choice E) doesn't provide an explanation in this context as the company was successful previously and doesn't indicate why the company would experience a negative development, as well as how the financial situation would change from this, resulting in success or failure.\n3. Similarly, debt (Choice E) is not likely to happen when a company is experiencing success.\n4. Income (Choice C) is a likely option and the most logical choice for the given context, but there is still an element of success which is required.\n5. Loss as a financial outcome is not logical either as, once the company has made a profit and enjoyed its success, the amount of money can still be maintained or increased.\n6. Choice E doesn't make sense as a way of describing debt. This may be an issue which occurs occasionally, but it is usually not the result of success and subsequent maintenance of the company's earnings.\n7.

This can suggest anxiety and unhappiness, but not performance-related issues.\n9. Anxiety (Choice B) is a feeling of worry or unease which could arise from performing. It could indicate performance anxiety, but it could also result from other situations including financial, professional, and relationship-related problems.\n10. Hence, we can eliminate these two options.\n11. Similarly, Happiness (Choice C), or emotional well-being, could be present even in the presence of anxiety, so this choice doesn't suit the description well.\n12. Therefore, the choices that could potentially fit our description most would be Anxiety (Choice C) and Anxiety (Choice E). However, there is a potential ambiguity in Choice E \"energetic.\" It doesn't state what the person actually feels, it just states whether or not they feel nervous.\n13. However, we don't need to eliminate Choice E yet, because the statement \"they probably suffer from what\" implies that they are likely to have some symptom or affliction.\n14. So how can we use this statement to eliminate Choice E. Let us examine Choice E's last word \"energetic.\" In English, when used as an adjective, an \"energetic\" person usually describes a hyper or energetic individual - not related to performance.\n15. Another option here is for \"energetic\" to be used as a noun, which often refers to a geographical location. This option cannot be ruled out either as it is not specified or clear.\n16. To eliminate this choice, we consider Choice E alongside Choice C.\n17. Given that Choice E \"energatic\" refers to a geographical element, while Choice C \"anxiety\" refers to psychological distress, the word choice is not fitting.\n18.

Looking at the answer options, Choice A: 'the only way to achieve peace' is not a logical thought for what an expert knows, it is quite different from special knowledge.\n2.

Choices: 0 A: boom B: pole C: oar D: paddle E: paddle\nRationales: When we look at the answer choices, a pole or stick is the closest word that matches the description in the question. A pole is a long thin piece of wood that can be placed in the middle of a canoe to help keep it upright.\nSimilarly, a pole is also used for keeping a canoe upright when it's not moving. This implies that a boom cannot be used to keep a canoe from tipping over, which means B is incorrect. A paddle is often associated with moving a canoe, but it's not specifically used to keep it upright, which means E is incorrect. An oar is also a stick, but it requires both hands to be used. It's not needed to keep a canoe upricht, so that's not what's being asked. An oar is similar to paddle, but not identical to a pole. That's why C isn't correct. When we're left with options, A and D, the best choice is A, because it's the only one left that fits the description in the question and it's a polite name used to refer to a long stick.\nAnswer: A - Pole\n\nInput: What was the first nationally televised baseball championship?

Happiness (Choice C) and Energetic (Choice E) do not describe stage fright, as the former entails feeling content or satisfied with life, while the latter describes a person who is filled with vitality and vital force. Hence, both choices are incorrect. \n10. Choice D, anxiety is the best answer here, as it is a psychological condition that causes feelings of worry, rumination, restlessness, and fear.\n11. We can conclude that a talented individual who does not like performing suffers from anxiety due to stage fright.\nAnswer: D. Anxiety\n\nInput: What are 3 characteristics of the pig?

Out-of-line with the given description, a talented person might not be anxious or happy (Choices C and E) when performing.\n9. A talented person that\u2019s energetic about performing but doesn\u2019t, is unlikely because such a person would already be performing regardless of their feelings towards it.\n10.

Choices:  highway B: expressway C: roadway E: freeway D: driveway\nRationales: One feature of an automobile is to travel on a highway. \nA highway typically refers to a road where vehicular traffic is generally the main activity.\nAn expressway is a road with controlled-access (one-way) traffic similar to a highway, but it\u2019s typically divided into several lanes instead of one.\nA roadway usually refers to any paved public highway. However, in the context of this question, it may refer to a road that\u2019s less common to find.\nA freeway is usually another term that\u2019s synonymous with an expressway.\nA driveway is typically a private road that\u2019s not open to the public.\n\nChoices A or B are not specific enough to indicate a highway, an expressway or a roadway would not be an appropriate feature on a sidewalk or a walkway.\n\nEven though a highway or an expressway are common, they may not necessarily be present on every coastal highway.\n\nTherefore, the most likely option for the response is C-roadway.\n\nAnswer: C-roadway\n\nInput: What are an example of a place?

What was the task the students were required to complete? Choices:  a: divide the number b: add the number c: explain the number d: multiple the number e: explain the rules that govern the number\nRationales: The question states that the task students were required to complete was without outside assistance. It is likely that, since they were given a homework assignment, they have not received full instruction on the subject matter.\n\nFrom this, we can tell that the task probably involves understanding and applying an understanding of mathematics.\n\nExamining the answer choices, option A: 'divide the number' is a mathematical operation.\n\nHowever, there are a few options:\n\n- Option B: Add the number: Addition is also a mathematical operation, just like division.\n\n- Option C: Explain the number: An operation in mathematics would have a certain syntax and would be something that can be written. If it is a mathematical explanation, however, it is more likely that it is verbal or non-numerical.\n\n- Option D: Multiply the number: Multiplication is also a mathematical operation.\n \n- Option E: Explain the rules that govern the numbers: This answer choice contains too much ambiguous information as the rules could refer to something written.

Choices:  A. the movie star B. the star C. the jungle D. the tiger E. none of these answers are correct\nRationale: The movie star might either keep the tiger in a cage at his home or make it into an animal attraction. Either way, he may call the tiger by a few of the possible names given, but may use a more specific name, such as \"The tiger\", \"Tommy\", or \"Bronx\", etc.\nThe option 'the star' is an invalid answer, as the movie star is not called \"the star\".\nThe option 'the movie star' is also an invalid answer because the movie star is not a movie.\nThe option 'none of these answers are correct' is incorrect because two out of the five answers are valid. \nTherefore, the right answer would be Choice C: the jungle \nAnswer: C.

Choices:  a: laptop b: cellphone C: cloud D: pda E: tablet\nRationales: Start by noting the word \"type\" from the title; which implies that these options refer to different categories of computers, and are not necessarily related to specific products or brands. \nAlso, consider the phrase \"for storing a large amount of data\"; it makes sense that some computers would be more suitable than others for large amounts of data.\n1. The given options can be clustered into two categories:\n    a) cellphone, laptop, tablet - all of these are portable and typically capable of storing a large amount of information, so it's a possibility\n    b) cloud - this option refers to cloud computing and could potentially store a large amount of data\n2.

Happiness (Option E) is directly negated by stage fright; this condition makes you preoccupied with negative or unpleasant feelings.\n13.

Options (Q1)-(Q5) are the different possible titles associated with a person who holds an authority position.\n2. The title should be specific to this position.\n3. In contrast- (2) and (3) - do not pertain to leadership roles.\n4. Option (4) \u2013 boss, is the most suitable answer, as it is a familiar term referring to a person of significance, like the one in the leadership position.\n5.

A choice that says that one can't be a 'good scientist' is incorrect, for a good scientist has to have each of the factors mentioned above.\n3. Hence, the options for scientists are a good research plan, a scientific community, equipment, education, money and knowledge.\n4.

Choices:  a: ability to laugh and cry b: bipedal c: intelligence d: large heads e: tallness\nRationales: We can identify that a question is asking about three characteristics of humans, which suggests that we need to consider at least three characteristics.\nOptions:\n1) Ability to laugh and cry. This is a specific emotion that humans are capable of experiencing. Although most mammals cry and laugh, human crying is an emotional response, while other species are more instinctive.\n2) Bipedal. The ability to walk upright is a characteristic associated with humans but not with other animals. Hominids also walk upright, but they aren't humans because they lack the other characteristics that distinguish humans from other species as well.\n3) Intelligence. This is a mental capability or capacity for reasoning, abstract thought, and learning, that's unique to humans.\n4) Large heads (choice E). There are human species like Homo sapiens (modern humans) and Homo Neanderthalensis (Neanderthals) who have larger heads than other species. However, size is not a distinct feature among humans.

D: fix them E: remove them\nRationales: The word 'faulty' indicates that that some of the lighting features in the car need replacement or repair.\n1. Car lights are usually maintained or replaced when they stop functioning normally, as they should. 2. 'Take it to the mechanic' is the answer option that requires repairing something that has been broken, i.e., the mechanic.\n3. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect, as lights cannot simply be repaired by the owner. \n4. Similarly, 'Replace them' would imply replacing lights that are functioning properly rather than fixing lights that have broken. Hence, Choice 4 is incorrect. \n5. 'Fix them', on the other hand, could imply that the lights have minor issues and the owner could simply fix them rather than replacing them. However, 'fix' could also mean physically replacing them.\n6. Therefore, it can be concluded that this choice is ambiguous as to what it entails. \n7. The final choice is'remove them', which does not make any sense, as you cannot remove lights.\n8.

This means that all other given options must be used to determine the context of the word that we are searching for.\n\nThe other options (B, C, D, E) are some words that have the same lettering as the letter K (the first letter of the given word).\n\nWhile we can infer that the word must be a noun, an adjective, or an adverb, the remaining three words do not have those roles. Hence, our initial response is to eliminate those options from consideration.\n\nNext, we can check the options that might be noun and/or have a word that starts or ends with 'K'.\nThus, we have D, E, C, A.\n\nSince the given proper noun starts with K, the only option that remains valid is A.\nHence, the correct answer is A: Kryptonite.\nAnswer: A.

Injury (Choice A) cannot be an answer. This allows us to immediately cross it out.\n8. Talent persons cannot suffer from injury (Choice B) is not applicable as the question asks us to consider only a condition that a person who is talented suffers from.\n9. Similarly, anxiety (Choice C) is excluded, for a similar reason, because it is not a specific condition that only a person suffering from anxiety may suffer from, any person suffering from this condition may also suffer from other conditions.\n10.

We eliminate Option C (1) because it is explicitly contradictory in logic. It is like saying 1 equals 1, which is obviously false because of the following law of mathematics: a number cannot be equal to itself.\n3. We eliminate Option D (3) because it is contradictory towards the principle above (1 equal to 1) where the logic is equivalent to 1 = 2.\n\n4. Hence, we are now left with Options B (5) and C (99).\n\nA key to this kind of mathematical problem is to consider the question as if it is referring to the total number of questions from which someone was able to answer.\n5.

The response \u2018anxiety\u2019 (Choice C) only refers to nervousness, it does not necessarily refer to a medical condition that can cause nausea or other physical symptoms. Moreover, the definition of butterflies only includes butterflies not physical symptoms so the answer choice of Choice C: Anhxiety + butterflies does not fit.\n11.

Choices: \u26a0\ufe0f A: speed B: space C: temperature D: mass E: matter\nRationales: As seen in the word energy, it is not definite or specific, for eg. speed (Option A) is an indication of kinetic energy. Thus,'space', 'temperature', and'mass' are also specific to kinetic or mechanical energy. 'Matter' is again a category specific to this energy and thus is incorrect.

Bacterial evolution is important for several reasons related to its hosts. The sentence does not ask about bacterial evolution, in relation to itself; rather it asks about the impact of evolving bacteria.\n2. Bacterial evolution in relation to its hosts would result in a pathogen becoming more pathogenic, bacterial adaptation, evolution from being pathogenic and more.\n3.

Talent persons cannot suffer from injury (Choice B), butterflies and anxiety (Choice C) are also not relevant because of the provided description of the person in question and the statement that they are talented.\n8. Happiness (Choice D) is not relevant because this person does not seem to be unhappy about their talent when performing, in fact, they are happy and confident. 9. Hence, we are only left with Energetic (Choice E).\n10. We know that talent persons cannot suffer from butterflies (Choice C).\n11. Looking at Choice E: Energetic, there is nothing that explicitly states that an energetic person is one who does not necessarily want to perform or enjoy performing.\n12. We know however, from the given description, that someone who is talnt but does not enjoy performing may be described as having \u201cbutterflies\u201d or being anxious during performing.\n13. This can be described as being energetic but not in a way that someone who enjoys performing would be able to deal with easily.\n14. Hence (Choice E), an energetic person can suffer from anxiety.\n15. As the question does not specify this is what is causing the issue, we know that an energetic, anxious, and talented person is not unlikely to face stage fright.\n16.

Choice D: Anxiety is a likely outcome because anxiety about performing can hinder the person\u2019s willingness or enjoyment to perform. It induces feelings of worry and unease before the performance thereby creating a negative impact as the person is now mentally unfit. \n10.

Choices:  a: going out at night b: going out during the day c: going out on Sunday evening d: going out on Sunday night e: going out on Sunday afternoon\nRationales:\n1. The question is basically asking us to identify the time-of-day to avoid road congestion on Sunday evenings.\n2. Our first thought should be during rush-hour traffic, which would be from about 4 pm to 8 pm.\n3. However, this doesn\u2019t actually make much sense because if too many people avoid rush-hour traffic on Sunday evenings, then the road will likely be congested. There will be an influx of motorists during rush hour which will result in a gridlock on the road.\n4. Additionally, going out at night doesn\u2019t help avoid traffic since we\u2019re likely going out at night because there\u2019s too much traffic during the day.\n5.

Choices 'fur', 'hairy ears', 'thick skin', and 'the key' are not suitable responses. This is because they pertain to animals in specific locations.\n3.

A 'cab' (choice D) is a taxi specifically hired for the purpose of traveling somewhere. Therefore, it's irrelevant to this particular scenario in which the person was feeling intoxicated and couldn't drive.\n3. A 'taxi' (choice F) is another type of taxi and is also irrelevant here.\n4. The choice that pertains most to an emergency or an immediate situation is choice E: call the police. \n5.

However, the question implies that someone would suffer from \u201ca condition\u201d which suggests they are afflicted or having an illness or malady of some kind.\n10. Choice 'anxiety' (Choice C) is the most plausible option since it involves a severe mental state of unease, fear, or worry that can lead to avoidance of specific situations or settings or activities. \n11. Choice D: happiness is the least logical option because the question is asking about a condition someone who is talented and would rather not perform may experience. Happiness is an emotional state that is associated with an overall positive feeling or well-being, which is typically something people want to feel. \n12.

Thus, the answer is Choice C: Anxiety, since a person may suffer from an anxiety condition even if they are talented and would rather not perform.\n13. A person with stage fright or performance anxity typically experiences extreme anxiety in these situations and this is likely to negatively affect their enjoyment levels.\n14. Therefore, Choice C: Anguish is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: B: Injury in one or many performing\n\nInput: Someone with an aversion to ____ is unlikely to find performing enjoyable. Choices:  A) an audience B) the stage C) performing D) fame E) rehearsing\nRationales: The question is asking what a person with an apprehension of the stage would not like to perform.\n1. Based on the options given, Choice A: an audience, cannot be the correct answer as not all performers would choose to avoid the audience, which typically observes them. \n2. People can be wary of performing in front of a crowd because of various reasons such as nerves, anxiety, stage fright, and stage presence.\n3. The presence of these conditions would indicate that the person dislikes performing due to a psychological condition.\n4.

The keyword that describes this exercise, \u201cWhen they first traveled\u201d, implies searching or exploring while traversing a place. This means the answer could either be that they were searching (looking), travelling for, or wanting to explore or to look around.\n2.

There is an ambulance behind the home. So, only 2 and 4 can be true.\n5. Look at each response: Option C - \u2018a cat\u2019 seems to be a logical choice, but it\u2019s unlikely. It might seem to suggest a story about a cat but then why is there dog behind the home? If the man saw a cat, he wouldn\u2019t see a dog.\n6. Similarly, option D may seem logical, but it doesn\u2019t make sense. It implies that cat is behind the home and there is a child who is barking. How can cat be barking???\n7.

Choices: A: meeting B: convention C: congress D: convention E: congress\nRationales: The options that relate to a \"group of people getting together in a room\" are meeting, convention, congress, and discussion. The word used to describe \"group of people discussing\" - \"discussion\" - is not included in the given set of options. This is important because the final outcome of a discussion is not typically a specific type or purpose of meeting. The options A through E are the correct word choices for a group of people getting together to discuss a topic. However, these words are also interchangeable with each other on occasion, so the correct answer must be based on word meaning as well as contextual understanding.\n1. Considering the given answer options, the most logical answer given to the word choice is Conventio,n as 'congress' does not have a specific'meeting' or 'discussion' type attached to it. This only indicates it's simply 'a meeting.'\n2. In summary, option E is the correct answer.\nAnswer : E: convention\n\nInput: Which of the following is an ideal gift for someone who has everything?

Choices: B: laser C: lightning D: magnets E: wifi\nRationales: The question asks what would power the latest technology in cellphones. It is obvious that the question is referring to a device without any of the conventional parts - namely SIM cards and batteries, hence the options do not include these two components. Instead, the question is asking what would power this new technology instead of conventional parts.\n1. Option 'laser' is highly unlikely as a cellphone isn\u2019t made of glass and not much in a cell phone requires lasers.\n2. 'Lighting' doesn\u2019t seem like an accurate answer for the same reason.\n3. 'Magnets' is unlikely in a cellphone as these have no place in a device which is meant to be carried around and used anywhere.\n4. Option 'WIFI' is not accurate as this doesn\u2019t solve the question, where it states that the technology doesn\u2019t require SIM cards or batteries, so that there is nowhere to plug in WiFi. \n5. Hence, the correct response is option 'E' - technology that allows a cellphone to operate without SIM cards or batteriies.\nAnswer: E. wifi\n\nInput: On a field trip, if a group of students is taking pictures of things at the museum, they are?

Among the choices that do not match the description, the option happiness (Choice B) might sound odd because someone suffering from mental imbalances will presumably not be generally contented. Happiness (Choice E) does not relate to mental struggles that accompany performing in front of other people.\n8.

The first step is to understand the question and then answer the question.\n2. The question asks us what is capable of liffting a fullback off the green. Thus, the options in this question will depend on what is capable of liftting a fullback off tne green, not who is capable of lifft.\n2. Thus, there is no need to analyze each choice individually because we already know the answer choice is a truck.\n3. There are only two options here: Answers: a) A tackle and b) a truck\n4.

Choices:  I: have a lot of money II: have a great job III: be satisfied with what one has IV: be satisfied with life V: have the right mentality\nRationales:\n1. The question asks how one can be rich when they don\u2019t have a lot of money, implying that wealth must be a matter of state of mind, and not just about income and possessions.\n2. Some answers might not exactly apply, or the person might not be wealthy either way but we'll consider them all. \n3. The two most plausible answers must be either having a lot of money or having the right mentality (choice I and V respectively).\n4. A common misconception is that the answer must be in order of most to least logical, or that answers that are true should be more suitable.\n5. However, the correct answer does not have to indicate the logical progression of the information provided, and instead, the answer could be either the answer that is closest to the statement of the question (be wealthy despite not having a lot of money) or the answer that most fits the logical progression (V having the right mentality). \n6.

We should not edit it when we know that we made a wrong word or grammar errors. \n2. Ignoring it is not appropriate if that is part of the question. \n3. Adding more space between words or grammatical errors doesn\u2019t show any skill about editing.\n4. Correcting error shows that we know how to proofread a sentence correctly. \n5.

To narrow down your search, consider eliminating the options which make no sense or have no relation to the subject matter. a. taste: This is irrelevant as it does not relate to whether humans like the taste or not. \n3. b. the way pig is farmed: This is also irrelevant as it does not clarify which type of pig is being referred to, which may or may not be the type humans consider to be the food of choice. \n4. c. where pork are farmed: This does not have anything to do with the food of choice of humans either as it simply refers to the pig.\n5. d.

However, both are difficult to connect to the provided situation. While a hyperactive personality could be energetic enough to overcome stage fright and anxiety, that's probably not what the question is asking for.\n9.

Choices: 1) It is a rational number 2) It is an unordered collection 3) It is irrational 4) Its magnitude is zero and none of the other 5) They are all true\nRationales: Let's figure out what each of the two answers represents.\nAn ordered collection is a set of distinct elements where order counts. For a set to be ordered, however, it needs to contain an element or elements whose ordering relationship is relevant.\nFor example, a set consisting of an apple, a banana, and an orange is ordered because apples are smaller than oranges are.\nOn the other hand, an unordered collection is a set composed of elements without ordering. The most commonly known example of this is a set consisting of only a single element with no inherent ordering between them. (This makes sense when you consider the difference between ordered and unordered maps.\nNext, determine what each of the remaining three answers doesn't mean, noting the different kinds of answers that we've seen:\n1) A rational number - One with a whole and a fraction is an example of a rational number. An irrational number is an algebraic number", "answer": " 9"}

I.B and I.E are incorrect because one can't buy something not mentioned in the options, thus can't buy the color red or price tag.\nII.

Choice B, 1 to 15 hours is not ideal either, because while it is possible for one to train at that rate, doing so is not ideal in order to achieve optimal performance. Choice C, 1 to 3 hour is the only correct option because it is the amount of time the athlete trains every week. \nRationales: Choice D, all of the above, is incorrect because all of these are wrong since they range from less than 1 hour to over 12 hours so there are options that are not even close to an average time.

Looking at the answer options, the choices are: Southern, Western, Northern, Eastern, and Central.\n4. Options A, B, and C are incorrect as they do not correspond to identifiable regions in America.\n5.

The terms anxiety (option C) and ecstatic happiness (option E) may be confused by someone who is not familiar with the technical definition of anxiety.\n11. In technical sense, anxiety refers to the response to perceived danger, stress, and threatening experience. An ecstatic or elated type of happiness is different as it is accompanied by a sense of joy and delight. \n12. Therefore, in the context of the question, option C is more likely to describe the feeling of stage-fright, whereas option E would more naturally describe enthusiastic happiness. \n13.

The question calls for the location or areas of certain elements or features that constitute the outside or exterior of a building.\n2. The term 'outside' in the question refers to an exterior, like a yard or lawn area.\n3. A parking spot is not defined as being outside but rather on the area where one can park.\n4. A parking lot and a park are also not on the outside but within a building complex or in some nearby spaces.\n5. A parkway is a type of roadway that passes alongside a park. However, it doesn't meet the criteria for the definition of 'outside a building'.\n6 A crosswalk is a pedestrian crosswalk outside of a building. Though it's possible for one to find something similar to 'crosswalk', it doesn't meet 'outside of a building 'criteria.\n7.

Excitement 5. I'm hungry\nRationales:1. Identify the option that best summarizes the overall feeling of the given options.\n2. 'Focus' describes none of the options.\n3. 'I'm hungry' does not apply to a spelling bee, hence, it can be eliminated. Moreover, only one option can be selected.\n4. 'Focus' does not describe an overall feeling either, hence it is incorrect.\n5. Only one option can be selected, hence 'Medical school' can be eliminated from the answer choices. If there was a doctors\u2019 spelling bee, doctors would be in competitive mode and that would give them an overall feeling of happiness or excitement. Doctors would likely want to win.\n6.

Take a look at it\n3. Find out the symptoms\n4. Look for bumps\n5. Smell it\n 1. The first three answer choices can be excluded because they do not make sense as part of the procedure for identifying a disease on a plant.\n 2. We must examine these choices individually to determine whether they are plausible enough to be considered solutions.\n 3. The solution, 'check the symptoms', is relevant because symptoms are characteristic features of a condition or disease.\n 4.

Night - It typically occurs between midnight and 6am. Nights are associated with rest and relaxation, as they are considered a quiet, dark time for sleep when daytime activities have ended and the sun sets.\n2. Middle of the afternoon - As the daylight hours continue during this period, the mid-afternoon can be a decent time for restful sleep. This is because the sun is slightly lower in the sky, which may have an overall calming effect.\n3. Nighttime - During the night time it is dark, quiet, and cool.\n4.

We can see that the given statements mean that certain modes are necessary to move an object to a specific position. It is also clear that A cannot be the answer, since there aren't any modal verbs and/or modifiers that would indicate a certain position. Next, we examine the choice B, which contains verbs like 'can', 'can not', 'cannot' and 'to be able to', all of them indicating that a certain state is necessary to achieve a certain goal. Choice C uses different modal verbs, such as may, might, would, can not, etc., but doesn't contain any words or phrases that would indicate a position or state of a specific location, so it can also be eliminated. Choice D also does't indicate position or state of a certain location. It is clear that the answer to this question has to be choice B, and the statement could mean that a particular object is in the specific position only when it is possible to move the object. B) indicates both a state and a location. The given objects are specified by their location, so it is correct to say that A is not a condition that is true.\n\nInput: To determine whether the following statement", "answer": " 10"}

That doesn't mean we have to have fruits at every meal. But if one wants to eat fruit a few time a day, they have to include it among the meals. Hence, option C can be eliminated.

Choices: \nA: makeup B: haircut C: stage fright D: energy E: costumes\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about what you would typically need to look out for when preparing for a performance.\n2. The key consideration is that getting ready for a performance would involve prepping oneself physically, emotionally, or psychologically to deliver the best performance when it counts.\n3. We know that performing arts such as dance, theater, or music involve physical movements and often need a great deal of energy to make them look authentic and believable.\n4. Performers are often prepared by their instructors or their peers to maintain the energy they are expected to display on the stage.\n5. But the energy a performer displays is not limited to physical, it can be emotional too. \n6. They may have to be in the state of high adrenaline to portray a certain emotion or to remain relaxed throughout the performance in their roles.\n7.

Choices:  B: sugar C: gluttony D: mice E: nothing\nRationales: Choices A, B, C, D, and E would not make sense in this context.\n1. The text states that an apple is sweet. Not all food items, even if they contain sugar, are sweet in flavor. Hence, in this context, apples should not be identified based on the presence of sugar. \n2. Like as not, gluttony is a virtue and this word makes no sense in this context. \n3. Mice, as evidenced in the text, never consume apples and, therefore, cannot make an apple sweet. \n4. 'nothing' is not a plausible answer because apples would, ideally, not have any flavor. \n5. Hence, between Choices D and E, the most plausible answer, is E.

The question is about which of the options would be more powerful in determining someone's cell (or tissue) health in their body.\n2. To identify the best choice, we must analyze each option to determine what is more powerful: Stress, Diet, Vitamins, Sleep, or Environment.\n3. Option 1 (stress) refers to external factors that can cause internal damage.\n4. However, internal factors such as nutrition and bodily functions are referred to under option 2 (diet).\n5.

The answer can be eliminated as we know \u2018energetic' (Choice E) does not refer to mental or emotional conditions, and is unrelated to performance anxiety.\n10. The term 'butterflies' (Choice B) also does not directly refer to stage fright or perform anxiety and can be eliminated. \n11.

We can eliminate anxiety (Choice C), happiness (Choice D), and energetic (Choice E) as these don't fit the definition of a mental or emotional condition that can cause discomfort and performance issues.\n9. We can eliminate \"injury, talent persons cannot suffer\" (Choice B) because we already know that injuries don't generally cause stage fright in performing people.\n10. Therefore, the answer must be C: anxiety. The correct response is \"C\".\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: What should you do if someone has been injured in a building collapse? Choices: \tA: ask them to take action B: be afraid C: go to safety D: stay in place E: leave a building because it may be compromised\nRationales:\t1. The question is simply asking what should we do if someone has been hurt or injured in the collapse of a building. \n2. This suggests we look for a course of action that can provide help for injured people or keep others from harm.\n3. Here we understand that some options may not be suitable as they don't mention helping injured people or protecting the safety of others.\n4. Here we note that asking someone to take action (Choice A) or becoming afraid (Choice C) are both inappropriate and ineffective courses of action for what we are seeking to resolve.\n5. Staying in place (Choice E) may be helpful for the injured person if they have medical training or are able to take care of themselves, but this is not what we're looking for. \n6. Going to safety (Choice D) is appropriate since we're looking for something that will benefit the safety of people caught up in a collapse and can help rescue injured people too. \n7. Hence, the answer must be D: Go to safety. The correct response is 'D'.\nAnswer: D: Go to safety\n\nInput: What happens when you lose all the electrons on your outer shell?

Choices: A: playground B: bedroom C: living room D: classroom E: school\nRationales: A bedroom is a private room within a place of residence intended to be a sleeping room and storage area. A living room is a large room in a house, apartment, etc., that is often used to receive guests or host visitors. A classroom is a room, typically with tables and chairs and often with other furniture, where a lesson is given to students or pupils. A school is a building in which one or more teachers instructs students or pupils.\n\nGiven these options, the choice Playground is the most appropriate because it refers to a specialized area, within a public space, that is designed for physical activity, and is common to children.\nA living room, bedroom, and classrooms have some characteristics that could make them seem like candidates for the answer. The living room, being a space for visitors in the house, could qualify given that children may be entertained in the presence of other non-family members. However, the bedroom and classroom are more specific settings than just being any kind of 'room' or 'place' and cannot be considered valid as viable alternatives to Playground (choice A). \nA playground, being different from a living room and a classroom, as well as a bedroom, could be more appealing to the children as it is a specialized area with age-appropriate equipment designed mainly to accommodate physical and outdoor activities like physical exercise, swinging, climbing, etc. Therefore, the most appropriate answer to the question is Playground (choice A), a specially designated area used for recreational purposes that is popularly used by children.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: In a class, what should you do when the teacher assigns you a seat?

Similarly, a happy and energetic individual (Choice E) may not be suffering from anxiety and would thus remain free to perform unhindered without anxiety.\n10.

Choices: 12) Choices: A) 4-5 B) 1 C) 12 D) 26.5 E)6\nRationales: There are no clues within the question to help eliminate choices.\n1. We start by taking the number 25 and dividing by four, giving us 6.\n2. We then add 7 at the end and get 13.\n3. We then subtract 7 from 13, which gives us 6.\n4. We add another seven again which gives us 13 once again.\n5. We subtract 4 from 13 and get 9.\n6. We add another seven to get 16.\n7. From there we subtract seven again, resulting in nine.\n\n8. We repeat this multiple times to get to the final answer.\n\n9. The final answer is 4-5-12-7-4-4-7. \n10.The minus signs between the numbers indicate that each one, when multiplied by a negative one, will give a negative number, resulting in a long and negative decimal.\n11.The 4\u2019s are multiplied by -1 and give negative answers, making four and then nine.\n12.We then get negative twelve multiplied by -1 which result in the subtraction of 24, which means 24-24 = 0.\n13", "answer": " 200"}

Happiness (Choice C) may not be an issue for a performer, as they may still be happy while performing, even if they feel anxious or scared.\n10. Option E, Energy, wouldn't be a good fit for someone suffering from performance anxiety or stage fright as it would suggest a lack of anxiety, even though this isn't necessarily the case.\n11.

Choices: A: 8 cups B: half our body weight C: 5 cups D: more than our body weight E: 4 cups\nRationales:\n1. There are several factors that need to be considered when determining the appropriate amount of water to consume. According to scientific research, the estimated intake of water for most individuals would be around 2.7 liters per day, or about 3.7 liters in 24 hours. This amount assumes a normal bodyweight of 69 kg.\n2. Additionally, to obtain the proper amount of water throughout the day, it is important to understand some factors that may affect the body's water levels. For example, if someone is doing intense physical activity, they may need more water than usual for hydration purposes. In this case, an extra litre or so can be consumed to compensate for the additional water loss through sweat and breathing.\n3. It is also important to note that water requirements may vary from one individual to another based on factors such as age, sex, pregnancy status, and physical condition. For example, a pregnant woman will need more water than someone who is not pregnant due to the additional fluid demand during pregnancy and lactation. Moreover, children are more susceptible", "answer": " 17"}

'Inability to understand' (Choice C) could mean a limited cognitive process, however, such a condition is not suitable in this scenario where it's a question of preference - does someone prefer performing or not.\n10. 'Inability to read' (Choice D) doesn't make much sense since performing on a stage is not related to reading.\n11.

'Happiness' (Choice E) is another mental condition, however, it refers to a different type of condition that does not necessarily coincide with a person's propensity to go on stage and perform.\n14.

The question asks about a characteristic of creatures, particularly animals.\n2. Options 'A, C,D and E' are all animals so they must not contradict in the answer.\n3. For options 'B and F' we want logical plausibility. Sloth is a creature that is mostly used as a pet and that is a no.\n4. So now we can choose from horse and monkey.\n5.

Choices: \tA: to stay cool B: it was thirsty C: the container had a faucet D: it was hungry E: it was humid in the air\nRationales: In this question set, the questions are asked in a form of a comic.\n1. The above question refers to a cat being thirsty and drinking water for hydration in hot weather even though it does not feel thirsty.\n2. This answer choice can be excluded as there is no evidence that the cat is thirsty or hungry.\n3. The phrase \"it was humid in the house\" can mean a variety of things, including water vapor being present in the air causing the warm and moist feeling.\n4. In this context, the 'humid' is referring to the air, or the house, and not the cat's body.\n5. Therefore the correct answer, that does not have this mistake, is option D - the cat is simply thirsty.\nAnswer: D - the cat is thirst.\n\nInput: What has 88 legs and stirs?

Furthermore, \"butterflies\" isn't commonly used to describe feelings of anxiety.\n9. Although anxiety (Choice C) can make people feel more nervous before performing, it doesn't necessarily cause them to dislike performing in the first place, hence it is not a fit for the answer. \n10. \"Happiness\" (Choice D) could be an option as in some cases a person can find happiness on the stage, but it doesn'ty necessarily cause someone to experience any dislike for performing in the first place.\n11. \"Energy\" (Choice E) could also be an answer because having a high level of energy may often make performers feel more confident and energetic on stage.\n12.

Choices: A: lodge B: ski lift C: chairlift D: ski shop\nRationales: The correct answer is D: ski shop.\n\n1. The initial statement about having to stop at the ski shop means that there is a reason to go there instead of somewhere else.\n2. The question then asks us to choose the most appropriate answer from the choices given, all of which are possible reasons why people would go to the ski shop in the given situation.\n3. The location of the ski shop, at the foot of Mt. Shasta as specified in the initial statement, means that this is the place where people stop before heading up to the top of the ski mountain, or Mt. Shasta.\n4. The choices for the correct answer are as follows:\n    lodge \u2013 a place people lodge or spend the night\n    ski lift \u2013 a device that carries people on skis attached to one foot up higher on the mountain\n    chairlift \u2013 a device similar to the ski lift, but people sit on it instead of standing\n    ski shop \u2013 a place where people shop for ski equipment\n5. From these three choices,'ski shop' is the one that is closest to the situation described in the question. This shows that people have to stop at the ski shops before they continue heading up to the mountain.\n6. Therefore, the answer to the question is D: ski shop\n\nInput: Who is the greatest boxer of all time? Choices:  F: Mohammed Ali\nB: Mike Tyson\nC: George", "answer": " 19"}

The meaning of the phrase \"butterflies\" (Choice C) isn't appropriate - it doesn't refer to the state of anxiety or nervousness.\n9. Anxiety (Choice D) is an appropriate answer to the question as it refers to a state of emotional tension or apprehension.\n10. Even good performers can be anxious, this would be a suitable candidate for the correct answer.\n11.

From the first letter to the fourth letter, which is from 'b' to 'd', they are all consonants, this indicates each part of the seasons are going in a particular order. From the fourth letter to the ninth letter, which is from letter 'd' to letter 'k', all of them are vowels (except for letter 'g'). This indicates that the season of summer comes at the end of the year. Note  that letter 'j' does not indicate a vowel or consonant as it is a letter. [2.

But, that's not the point why I'm not writing this text. \nThe question is about the reason why you want to find out whether you have passed the test and whether you are smart or not. \nOption C says that you want to find that you are good. That is not a good reason to find out whether you passed the exam. You knew already long time ago that you passed the exam by doing well in most of your exams and by doing better than your classmates. That's the reason why you took the test in the first place. You wanted to get the grades for your class work. \nYou can also try to analyze the options C and E, you can see that option C also says that you are not smart, which is not true as you passed the exam. So if you're smart or not is not a reason to find out whether the exam is hard or not. If the exam was hard, it depends on the results in the exam that you passed it or not.\n\n\n\nYou can analyze options A,B,D, for each of the options you need to find out whether the answer is true to find out the results in the test or not.

{"text": "still like it despite suffering from an actual injury. A person could still be talented despite not being injured either.\n7. Talent persons cannot suffer from injury (Choice B) does not make much sense as the question is about someone with talent that doesn\u2019t want to perform, making it unlikely they wouldn't be able to perform due to lack of talent.\n8. Being talent wouldn\u2019t necessarily make someone happy (Choice C), since even highly-skilled and talented individuals with years of training experience can still feel negative emotions such as anxiety, worry, and uneasiness in situations where they have to perform.\n9. Likewise, a feeling of happiness or contentment (Choice E) doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect someone's mental or emotional well-being.\n10.

Choices: A: act B: run C: travel D: dance E: work\nRationales: The question is asking about a type of activity that a group of people enjoys doing.\n1. The options are: act, run, travel, dance, and work.\n2. \"act\" does not make sense as this would only be applicable to a few types of performance such as theater and film.\n3. Likewise, \"run\" would only refer to a group of people that participates in running as a hobby or for exercise.\n4. Travel is a way of moving from one place to another, typically going somewhere exotic or unfamiliar with the purpose of vacation, sightseeing, or exploration.\n5. \"Dance\" would not be the appropriate response as it also does not refer to a specific activity that a group of individuals might enjoy doing. \"Work\" is likely to be incorrect too despite the work may sometimes be enjoyable. \n6. Therefore only \"dance\" and \"act\" can be reasonably related to the given activity. \n7.

'Talent persons cannot suffer from injury, and butterflies' (Choice B) does not make sense given that it is an obvious contradiction and that stage fright is not a stage-specific condition.\n8. Anxiety (Choice C) is a condition that could explain stage fright, so it is a valid answer option, but its inclusion on the answer list makes the question too ambiguous, so it can be omitted.\n9. 'Happiness' (Choice E) wouldn't explain stage fright either, as it wouldn't be a reason why someone would not enjoy performing.\n10. Thus, only options D, E and F are valid answers. \n11. Based on our answer selection, 'happiness' (Option E) can be ruled out, since the stage-fright sufferer couldn't be happy if they were on stage.\n12. Option A also becomes invalid because it directly contradicts the statement \"talent persons cannot suffer from [injury] and butterflies\" (Choice B).\n13.

The headache can be relieved by sleeping, taking a nap, taking ibuprofen, or drinking some water.\n3. Sleeping (Choice B) won't help much as it's not a quick and effective fix. It also has the risk of making sleep more difficult.\n4. Taking a nap is slightly more effective than going to sleep, so it also shouldn't be selected.\n5.

Anxiety (Choice C) is a possible answer for the task, but it is more applicable when you have to perform unexpectedly or unfamiliarly. This does not mean that a person who enjoys performing isn't anxious.\n10.

Choices:  B: always closed C: always open D: sometimes closed sometimes open E: there is not any doors\nRationales: The scenario is one with two doors, two other doors where we assume both doors cannot be opened before the second one is opened and vice versa.\n\n6.

The answers can be judged based on their relevance to the reason why the candidate is qualified. \n2.

Similarly, it makes little sense that a talented actor with a significant amount of confidence in their ability to perform would also experience anxiety (Option C). \n9. It's hard envision why a talented performer suffering from anxiety would be in a state of happiness (Option E).\n10. The final option (Option D), energetic asserts that the actor is a person who is full of energy and vitality.\n11. However, the condition does not specifically necessitate that the actor be energetic.\n12. This option is a poor fit.\n13. Therefore, the best explanation for the phrase'suffer from' in the context of stage fright or performance anxieties is that they are mental or emotional conditions.\n14.

Choices: 1: solid, 2: liquid, 3: vapor, 4: energy\nRationales: A. The question is asking whether a particular object is in a phase of the physical matter (matter) cycle.\nB. A solid object is one that can exist independently by itself. Therefore, it would not float if placed in liquid or gaseous (vapor-like) environments.\nC. A liquid object is one that can hold and shape other objects like water. Therefore, a typical liquid object would not require the use of a supporting object like an anchor, hence, it would be able to float, but a gas, or gas-like object (vapor) would require a support to be in a similar situation.\nD. An energy object (like electricity) cannot float because it lacks the physical (mass) property of an object and would disperse into the environment.\nE. An energy object (electricity) is able to travel across the environment but not in liquid situations, hence it cannot float in a liquid environment.

Choices:  i. by absorbing them with roots   ii. the water vaporizes   iii. water gets trapped inside their leaves  iv. by absorbing CO2   v. plants are able to exhale water vapor so it evaporation in their surrounding \nRationales:1) Plants are able to absorb more moisture by absorbing them with their roots. 2) The water vaporizes, meaning evaporation happens, when it is exposed to the sun. 3) Wet or damp leaves can hold a lot of water; when a plant is exposed to water from heavy rain, the rainwater is often absorbed through plant leaves. 4) plants are able to exhalation water vapor, the absorbed water vaporizes in their surrounding.

For example, there are exceptionally gifted singers, dancers, or speakers in the world who may nonetheless be unable to feel comfortable performing.\n8.

However, a person with talent can be worried about how they will perform even if they are confident with their abilities. Such a situation would not lead to an injury either (anxiety).\n8. Choice C seems like a potential answer since the statement mentions anxiety. However, as we know anxiety can be about the performance outcome, not the performance itself. Also, there are people who enjoy performing but are still anxious.\n9. To rule out Choice E, consider a performer who is very skilled but is not motivated. Is there any way they could still suffer from stage fright? The answer is definitely yes! Therefore, happiness doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t experience stage fright.\n10.

Next, analyze the answer choices that remain: anxiety (Option C) and happiness (Option E).\n9. Analyze these options and then, try applying this to the given question.\n10. Let\u2019s first see how the option anxiety fits the description. Anxiety and performance anxiety in particular, are characterized by feeling scared, nervous, anxious, and worried. Anxiety generally revolves around a specific event, such as giving a presentation, while performance anxiety is about any type of stage where you know you are likely to perform.\n11. So, anxiety can be described as a condition experienced by many who suffer from performance anxiety, but it is not specific to performance anxiety. This is confirmed by choice E (happiness) which could be considered an experience that someone may have after an act of performance, such as applause, but which is not exclusive to performance anxiety.\n12. In contrast, choice C (anxiety) is an emotion experienced not just in the aftermath of stage fright, but in varying situations. Also, anxiety is a common part of living with performance anxiety.\n\n13. We can therefore determine option (C: Anxiety) as being the best fit for the answer to the question.

Choices: A: the nearest drug store B: her cell phone C: her purse D: a new dress E: an old lover\nRationales: The question asks us to determine what the woman in the question was looking for.\n\n1. It is plausible that the woman was looking for her purse since she could have misplaced it.\n2. But there can also be the possibility that the woman was looking to re-enter the party.\n3. Since the woman was on her way out of the inn, we can say that she was not looking for a new lover.\n4. The woman would probably not have been looking for an old lover, since her host might not know her ex-lovers.\n5.

{"text": "Manex\nIt will take 8 hours to finish the entire tour\n\n### Explanatory Instruction\nThis is an application of the concept of _distance_. Distance is a measurement that is used to measure the spatial distance or separation among two points or objects. Distance is a scalar, i.e. a number having magnitude only. A scalar value specifies the magnitude of a real value. The difference between two scalar quantities is a numerical quantity and it can be positive, negative or zero. Scalars may be added together, subtracted, multiplied, divided and raised to a power. The difference between two quantities are called _displacement_. We will also learn about the concept of _difference_ in this article.\n\n#### The distance between two points is given by: d(p1,p2)\n\nd(p1,p1) = 0\n\n### Input 1: Driving directions for the trip\n\nThe road trip is scheduled to take approximately fifty-five miles to the destination. It takes one hour to drive the round trip that is 55 miles. That makes two hours of driving to get to the destination and return.\n\n### Inputs 2 - 3: Direction and time\n\nA tour bus driver is given driving directions to a destination. They are told to drive until they are 10 miles from their starting point and then return the shorter way, which is approximately 55 miles. After the bus driver reaches the destination, they will drive for two hours.\n\nThe distance from A to B is 10 miles, and it takes five minutes to get there. Therefore, it takes two hours to go one-tenth of the way around, which is 5 minutes. This means that you need to drive for two hours at a time to get to your destination.\n\nLet us look at how we can find the distance between a point and a vector. We have two vectors `v1` and `v2` with vectors as an x, y, or a z coordinate. To find the distance between two points, we need to find which of the vectors is parallel to the other vector. I will be focusing on the x-component of `v1` and the x-component of v2, because I want to find their distance. This number is then multiplied by 100 and subtracted from 100.", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "### Input 2:While visiting the local flea market you come across a box filled with jewelry at 77 percent off. You are considering buying it, but you're unsure how much the item is worth.

{"text": "50 sets of lace and 40 sets of lace\n\n### Input\n\nA) At a roller derby a few weeks ago, 4 teams were competing. Each team was made-up of 10 members so each member needed a pair of roller-skates to compete with and another pair of skate to use as a backup. None had laces yet, so all 10 members (4 groups of 5 teams) were offered 3 sets of  laces per pair of shoes. How many sets of Laces were handed out to the teams?\n\n### Output: 65 sets of laces\n\n### Response\n\nThe Input and Output is the question that I think you were trying to teach me how to do. \nIf you go to the input and the output that I tried to do and I added my own response that was 65 sets of Laces. I did this for two reasons. Reason #1 : If the members had a back up set of Laces that is an equal number of laces that you used to give as Laces to 4 groups of 10 people. Then on top of that you will give each member 3 laces for each pair of roller skate shoes. So that is 2 * 40 * 3 = 120 + 3 * (40 * 10) =240 +30 = 270 Sets of Laces. Reason #2: When you take the 5th set of Laces that you will give each team member. That takes away 5 groups of 10, this means that you used 4 groups of 5 skaters. So after you subtract 5 groups of 5 skates 40 * 4 = 160 + 3 *(160 * 5) = 640 + 150 = 790 Sets of Lakes. \nThat will add up to 790 + 270 = 1060 Sets of Lace. Since you gave a total of 3 laces for the 3 groups 160 * 3 =480 + 15=503. Then you must take away 503 \u2013 270 =233 sets of LACE.", "answer": " 240"}

{"text": "180 lbs\n### Reason: Wanda was at 110, and is now at 140. Yola weighed 420, and is now heavier at 220. Yola had doubled in weight since the amount Wanda gained in 2 years. 220 + 110 = 330. Dividing 180 into 330 comes out to 1.875. 0.625 of 110 is 68.75. 68.74 is 3/6 of 110 or 22.5. So 2 years 280. 280 * 2 = 560. 560 minus 22.5 equals 537.5. Which is 104 away from Yola's current weight (220), and 104 is what Yola weighed 10 years ago, and she gained half that in 2 years. So 220 - 104 = 116, half of 116 is 58.\n\n### Input\nInput: What is true of the following numbers (9,2,1,7)?

The parentheses will cause division to happen first because multiplication goes to the right so you must place the brackets in the parentheses first. Therefore for example if we had the numbers 3 and 6 and want to multipy we would have three times six and would write it like this: 6*3=18\n\n### Explanation:\nYou cannot have 6*3=24 as the answer because one of the numbers is not whole or we can say for example 6.3 and the answer is two and an 8 because we need both a whole number and a number with two decimals. In this example we need six and three is divisible by two so they will get the answer. But in the actual example you need to know it will come out to negative because its asking for the whole tire and one half is not whole. You would have to cut it again if you wanted to divide it to a half. And the book can be divided in half because both of them are whole numbers so they can do the division. I understand how they divided the book but they did it wrong because of the answer they got. They actually got a negative 30 because they got to the 2nd question that says divide and they used the 1st answer.\n\nWe know one half is not the whole because they said we", "answer": " 38"}

{"text": "Randy should practice 1 hour in the morning and an hour in the evening if he wants to become a piano master before turning 20.\n\nHe would need to practice each day about 22,425 hours, which is 22,440 hours if he is going to take two weeks off on vacation. This answer is the result of using the formula hours (or time x days) = # of hours because he practiced every day from Monday to Friday, and the second, he is subtracting the number of days of vacation to arrive at the real answer. This formula could be represented to solve the problem by using a graph with a starting point at the beginning of practice and ending at the end of Randy\u2019s life. This graph could be made by counting the days each year and placing them in a row on a horizontal. The time each day Randy practiced is the length of the vertical line which could be measured in an hour, and the number of years Randy can practice is the width of each line. The formula that was used is the measure of time from one point to another is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two segments.\n\n### Response 2:\n\nRandy should practice for 1 hour every day to make sure he mastered playing the piano before his 20th birthday. He would need around 14,274 hours to master the piano. Randy should aim for at least 2 hours a day, starting from age 12 when he really begins to start playing the piano and for the next years he plays the piano, he should practice an hour or less each day of the week.", "answer": " 5"}

Project #1 consists of three parts and is listed below as the first task. You can start working on\n> any of parts of the project as soon as you have set up a basic environment for using the language.\n\n### Project #1: Tic Tac Toe Game\n\n> 1. Develop your Tic Tac Toes game. The game should be a simple board game that allows you to play a game of Tic Tac To with another player.\n>   If you don't have another player for playing online or in person, you can use the library to play against the computer.\n>\n> The gameboard should be a 3x3 grid (9x9 grid also works for 2-players). Use a basic GUI (graphical user interface) \n> library, such as Tk, GTK+, or UIAutomator, to render the field and a separate window to display the information about the player.\n> 1.2. Use a simple algorithm that implements the basic rules of Tic Tac - Toe. For simplicity, your code will accept a boolean parameter\n>\n> that determines if the computer or a player will play.\n> 1..3. The logic should calculate the coordinates and make the corresponding mark. You can use any style that you want. It may\n>\n> look like a Tic Tac To gameplay. If you use two buttons to place the mark, it may be easier to test your game as long \n> as you can quickly enter coordinates.\n> 1.,4. The UI should make it possible for the user to enter coordinates, start a new game, or view the history of the game.\n\n---\n\n> 2. Your game should be implemented in Python.\n>\n> 3. The GUI does not have to be polished, but you should present a functional GUI to \n> prove the algorithm behind the game works. Your game can be used with libraries to create\n> a beautiful game. However, this will increase the development cost.\n>\n> Your program does not have to be completely", "answer": " 121"}

{"text": "237\n\n### Input\nA small poultry farms has 300 birds. In the first weeks, it's only 300 birds, so it's safe to assume no birds are lost per day. We'll use an easy variable of X to denote the number of  birds remaining in total. Thus, we have X=300 for x=0 at the beginning.\n\nOn the second day of disease outbreak, we'll lose 20 chickers, 8 turkeys, and 5 guinea hens. We'll have another simple variable Y to denote the number of birds lost on day two. Thus, Y = (20+8+5) for y=4.\n\nWe continue to day three with this new rule in our head, so we'll lose 4 chickens, 9 turkey, and 10 guinea hens. Thus, we'll have X-20 = (300-20) - 4 = 266, so on X=266 for x=3.\n\nContinuing on, we'll have Y-9 = 374, so Y = 374 for y=4. Our new equation will be 374 - 10 = X = 364 for x=4.\n\nContinuingly so, we will have Y = 373, X = 353, etc.\n\nWe'll have a maximum number of birds that will fit in the poultry farm after the week is over. We will have this number after seven days. Thus, the maximum number of birds that can be in the poultry during the week is equal to Y (373 in this case).\n\nBy a simple regress, we would have Y=373-144=229. This means the remaining number of birds is 229.\n\nThus, after seven days the number of birds left in the poultery will be 229. The remaining birds will be 22 fewer than 308=X.\n\n### Response\nYou start with 308, which we could assume to be the original amount, so X=308.\n\nOn the first day there are no birds lost so,", "answer": " 349"}

{"text": "56 books have been read.\n\n### Explanation:\nFirst I calculate Megan's number of books that have been read, by taking the question into \nconsideration. 1/4 is half of a unit in this sentence. So to divide  a quarter of the 32, I take it by 2.\nTherefore, Megan's number is 16. By asking Greg his multiple of 2, which is 9. Subtract this number \nfrom Megan's number, which gives the number of the total. This is what we are looking for. This number \nis 36 + Megan's number. So 36 + 16 then gives us 52. However, taking this number by 2 gives us 26.\nTaking this number by 2 again gives us 13, which equals 49. So 49 + 16 gives the final number of 65 since the rounding down is \nrequired. But since we take Megan's number by 2 again, we get 13. This will make our final answer to be 65 - 13, \nwhich is 52.\n\n### Input (cont'd):\nGiven:  Megan has read 3/5 as many books as Kelcie this year.  The total number of books that Megan \nand Kaylee have read is 11/4 times as many as Greg.  Greg has read twice the number of books as Megan \nplus Kelcie.  How many books have Megan and Kelcie read?\n\n## Input (Cont.):\n\n### Response (Cont.)\nSo again, Megan's book total is 16, Kelcie's book total is half of this because they divide 1/2 of 16 by 2. \nThis is Megan's book amount and Kelcie's book amount, which makes it 8. Greg has a multiplication of 2, \nwhich is an amount, which is 9 and again we subtract this from Megan's amount to get the final amount, which is 25.\n\n### Response\n\n### How:\n\nHow: I multiply and divide the question by 2 the same amount of times as the question requires.", "answer": " 65"}

Is the teacher\u2019s height smaller or larger than before?\n\n### Input Response: To compare the heights of objects, just divide the smaller object\u2019s height by 12. The original height is divided by 12 to make the height the same as the smaller height. This process is known as rationalization, and it makes the heights of the objects equal. So just divide the height by 12 to get the equal height. The height of the student is 1.72 feet tall and the original height is 30 5 inches tall.  When we divide 30 5 by 12 it gives us 2.54. Therefore, the height of the student is now 2.54 feet tall. The teacher\u2019s original height is 35.4 inches tall and the new height of the teacher is 2.54 times 12 inches tall. To obtain the teacher\u2019s new height, we must divide the new height of the student by 12 which gives us 29.25. The teacher\u2019s height is 29.26 inches tall instead of 35.4.

A student volunteer has a daily limit of 8 hours after which you must be an employee to use a plot. There is no cost to the land user for a volunteer or paid person to be on the land. A group can use the land if they have a paid person but each group member will cost the group $20 per day to use the land. If you are a part of a group but do not have $240 for the entire group, then there is a maximum of $40 for a single use for one person.\n\n### Response :She cannot go in at all on her own because if she has a student volunteer doing 8/10ths of the work for her or have a group pay the fee, then she cannot go in on her own. Therefore, She should use community volunteers.\n\n### Sample:What do you want?\n\n### Answer :I am interested in learning the answer I would get using only three inputs and one output only:\n\n### Input 1: A man is a lawyer and the owner of 10 houses.

{"text": "The answer to that question is 100 people.\n\n### Explanation: To find the number of people to fill the church you need to calculate the sum 6 * 20 which is equal to 120 after multiplying the rows with seats in them and then add 5 the number of seats in a single chair. This will get you the sum for 120 people. Then you divide the sum by the number chairs per row. Six chairs are in a row, so the total sum divided by six. The number 120 divided by six will get you the answer of 20. To fill the church with people you simply multiply 20 by five to get you the total number of people sitting in the church, which is equal to 20 * 5 which is equal to 40. \n\n\n20 * 5 is equal to 2 x 10 x 10, which is equal to the sum of 20. Each chair can have 10 people in it and a row can have10 rows of these chairs which adds up to equal 20.\n\n### Input :The bus started at 7:02 A.M. The passenger got on at 7:09 A.M.

{"text": "The students that don't like either food is 5 students.\n### Explanation: There are 5 students that said they didn't like either because 15 students like fries and 15 students like burgers so you subtract them by each other and then do 15+25= 40 students plus 10=50 and then subtract them from 50= 0 and then you can just keep adding to get what would normally be -5 because 50-55. So, 50-5 equals 50-5= 45 and 45+15-25=10 and 10-10=0 so now you only have 0 left now you add 0 with 45 and you end up with 45+0=45.

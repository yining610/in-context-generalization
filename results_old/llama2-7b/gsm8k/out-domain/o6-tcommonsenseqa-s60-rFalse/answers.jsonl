The reaction starts with calcium, which reacts with oxygen to create carbon dioxide and calcium hypochlorite, which reacts with water, creating sodium hypochlorite and producing the bubbles.\nThe more calcium, the more bubbles.\n\n### Output 4:\nCalcium is added to the water first. It reacts with water to create calcium hydroxide. The hydroxide then reacts with oxygen in the water, creating carbon dioxide gas bubbles.\nThis in turn combines with more water to form calcium hydrochloride. Calcium hydrochloride then reacts with more water to form more calcium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide then reacting with oxygen creating carbon dioxide bubbles.\nFinally, this process repeats until you reach equilibrium, which is when the reaction is balanced.\n\n### Other Response Types:\nIdeas could also come from a", "answer": " 48"}
{"text": "If the monster ate 847 people in the first hundred years, what's the answer? Answer will go here.\n\n### Input 2:\nIf only 847 total people had been eaten, it should eat more people in each subsequent year to get the food it needs. Instead, we can interpret the fact that the monster eats more people in each subsequent round on the next round, not the previous one.\n\nIf there are 847 people on a ship, and it took 847, the monster has not eaten any people this current century (year 3). That fact implies this monster only feasts on the first ship it encounters.\n\nIt could be seen as a predator hunting 847 people, so what's the answer going forward to that? We know the last ship (of 2^n people), so the first ship of n is unknown. It has to be the monster's meal every 2 years.\n\nSo for n<=2^847-2, how many people are on the first ship to be consumed? Answer will go here\n\n### Input3:\nIf every 2 years, it feats on at least one ship, is the same monster eaten in the same amount of time (on average)? It's a bit more complicated than that because ships had a shorter span of life compared to the century-long monster, but it gives an answer for the first ship.

How many percent of the male population are involved in this university study?\n\n### Demostration for Answer:\nGiven that the question is that men and women make up of the university population of the study, we must find a division between them. If we know the total university has 2,000 total students, we can find the total men and women by dividing this value by 2. This value would be 1,000/2 which gives us 500 men and 500 women. The value of 50% to the total population is 100. This is because 1,00/(2,000/1,000) which is 2,00/1, and you can take away the fractions to get 2.

It has a 0% chance of having all 15 students in one class.\n\n### Conclusion:In this example, there is a certainty that the classroom will have a 2-4 student ratio, but we can't just add these numbers to find out the result. There is an 80% chance (1-1) that the classroom has 2 or more students, so it's not possible.\n\n### Solution:The solution is to multiply the whole number by 2 for all the students, which is 30% of the students, and then add 2 to the 80% probability that the classroom will be two people to get a 1:8 chance.\n\n### Comment:This solution is incorrect. There may be five students in one classroom, but this solution can only account for two students at a time, which is only possible when the classroom is empty during the pandemic.", "answer": " 30"}

I think that since the students might have had trouble with the instructions provided in an assignment I would have liked to see the prompt provide more instruction so it was clear what the students were supposed to do. I think that it would help to provide clear steps and guidelines for students so they know what exactly they are instructed to do.\n\n### Teaching A Lesson:\nThe instruction and code is somewhat similar. The main concern for me with this activity is how will the students figure out if their answer is correct without having clear instructions provided for them. Sometimes, when the instructor doesn't provide what they need the students lose interest and quit. I've noticed many students are unmotivated and they give up if it's difficult.\n\n### Additional Prompts for Learning:\nProvide more instruction to help students be successful.\n\n---\n\n### Assignment 4: Reflective Post\n\n#### Topic:What was the most challenging aspect of creating your Instructable?  \nThe most challenging thing was getting all the information from the instructor to get what he wanted the", "answer": " 41"}

Total weight of 80.\n\nSecond delivery: Total weight of 56 pounds.\n\nThird delivery: 40 pounds of meat.\nIt took dusk for third butcher, so it means, three packages per second with 60 seconds between each package to finish.  \nThis means it took 60 divided by 4 packs per second to finish the delivery. This equals 15 seconds.\n\nThere are three packages per second and a 15-second problem. There are a total of 15 seconds, or 90 per hour, or of course 4200 per day. In reality, it is likely that the third delivery would have come after both of the other deliveries arrived.  \nThis would mean that the last three would have been 18 for the third butcher.\nIn all, the final result will have a total of 100 lbs for a total of 128.\n\nThe following are the steps that solved the problem and show that the response is not plagiarized.<br>\nFirst, I thought that I had figured out the problem, but it wasn't.

She wanted to spend a total of $500 and she had $500. \n\nWhen she made the first selection(Pick an item) it came up short and it needed to be at least $525.00. That is why Mrs. Smith needed $525. She needed to add $525 to reach at least $1025. Then at 15% off(discounts), it was $1025 after the discount minus $25, which comes out to $1000.00 and she reached her goal.\n\n### Input\nThe problem: Miss Smith went to a boutiqu where she intended to buy some clothes. The total amount she needed to spend was 500 dollars. \n\nThe first thing she did, she went to select her best pick, and when she came to the checkout, it showed that she reached this goal. After selecting her buy, she was only $25 short of what she needed but because she was given a 15 percent of a discount, it showed that she needed only 525 dollars.\n\n### Demo:", "answer": " 95"}

Another example is believing one will succeed in future events, in the presence of uncertainty. The term is also used in the social sciences in a more general sense, or less specialized than the term, which refers to such beliefs which are unfounded or uninformed by data or objective analysis.

It may come in the form of data, instructions, or codes. Input is the source of what is processed.\n\n### Output\n\nOutput is the result of information coming into a computer. The output results from a specific information set. Output is the destination of the processing.\n\n### Examples\n\nWhat computer programs you've downloaded on your computer are input, and seeing and using those programs is output. What data you give your computer when running a spreadsheet program is input, and the printout, charts, and tables produced are output.\n\nOutput of a computer or program may include data results, images, audio, or video displays. For example, when you enter certain data into a spreadsheet, output will include a table display of results.\n\n### Programmers and Output\n\nOutput should be clear and straightforward. This does not mean that it should be dull or boring. On the contrary, output should be engaging and readable.\n\n### Coding Skills\n\nThink about what the user will do in response to the output you present. This ensures the output provides what the user needs the output to provide, which may be different than the program's initial goal.\n\n### Understanding Output\n\nKnow what happens if something goes wrong with the user's output. Sometimes, what you present is not what the user wants, such as when a program outputs an error message.\n\nDon't just program to show. Create input or output the user truly wants so it is not useless, but is helpful and helpful.\n\n### Data\n\nData is the first entry point of the data. This is what the data or computer program accepts. The output of the data, whether it is a result, information, report, or graph, is the result of the data.\n\n### Example\n\nYour name is Alice and you want to see your age, but don't know how.

{"text": "The correct statement is \"The route has two intersections and each has five lanes and has a traffic signal.  The first intersection has one lane for northbound traffic and two lanes for southbound traffic; the second intersection has two lanes for northbound traffic and one lane for southbound traffic.\"\n\n### Why?:It doesn't matter if one of the lights are red or not.  If the first set of three lights are all red, you have to drive back through the other three lights, which is basically two routes.  You have the first and second intersections which have the lighting for each set of lanes.  If only the 1st route has a red light and you are on the 1st intersection route, then you would have to go the 2nd route in which none of the roads that you are on will have a light in your lanes.  If you are on the 2nd intersection then you would have to take the 1st route. If the first set of lights is green, you only have to travel through the first intersection which has one set of lights, so you have done half the route.\n\n### What's next?:\nWe should start at the beginning\n\n### What does the author want you to write?:\nI think she wants us to make all of the statements below in response to this question.\n\n## #2\n\n```javascript\nfor (; ;)\nbreak;\ncontinue;\nwhile (;)\nswitch ( )\nreturn;\n\ndo...while ( );\ndo...while ( )\ndo...while( );\ndo..while ( )\n\nif... else\nendif\nif... else\n\nif... else if... else\n\nfor..in.\nfor..range.\nfunction (parameters..);\nvar (initialValue..)\nvar (initialValue)\n```", "answer": " 5"}

As scientists develop new ideas about the way natural process or the universe works, or about different mechanisms and objects, they continue to seek more evidence and explanation to support their claims. \nA scientist's claim about something new becomes widely accepted only when the scientific method has been used successfully to generate a large, solid body of proof. These proofs are always tentative or subject to scrutiny, since no single piece of evidence could ever be considered all by itself adequate proof of an idea. There are always other factors to be considered. Even though the scientific method has been refined and streamlined over the course of some two thousand years, it still involves much more than the isolated actions that might be encompassed in the words \"research\" and \"experiment.\" A major part of the scientific process has to do with making careful observations, as well as with trying to predict the outcome of an experiment. As scientists try to understand natural processes and make theories about the natural world or about the universe, they often use the ideas of past scientists and engineers or those of people who come from different disciplines or other cultures, in order to test and refine them.

{"text": "I can help answer the question by determining how much snow fell per day (in inches), and how much of the previous day's snow was already there, and then applying the principle of conservation of volumes to get the answer I need.\n\nFirst, let's note that 18 inches of new snow adds to the pile of snow that was already there before, so it's important to note that the difference of how much snow fell during a day and how much of the snow that was already accumulated is important to note. \n\nAlso, note that it takes one day of snowfall for the pile to be 8 inches deep, so the day after that is 16 inches deep and so on, so we would expect the pile to be about 34 inches since it starts at 8 inches deep and then is 8 every day till there's enough snow so that 16 inches is added on that day.\n\nSo let's use a formula that we know for the volume of the snowdrift. In this problem the volume of one day would be 18.24 * 1,28cm^{3} so using this volume we need to multiply by the number of days (4).\n\nAnd so we find the final equation: (8^{1} + 8^{2} + 8^{3} + 8^{4}) V = 145977.85 \n\nAnd now solve for V:\n\n\n\nV =145978-203850/1617500*4\n\n\n### Input and Response:How would they do something that is not very difficult, very difficult, or incredibly difficult?\n\n\n### Comment:\nComment: 1- The user got the answer\n\n### Output:\n\n\n### User:\n#### User input\n---User input (input the values)\n\n### User response\n---Response(the answer)", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "The maximum number of residents that could live in the block of flats is 16 residents.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe first part of the statement describes the block of flats and the information on the number of apartments and the occupancy of the apartments. Let\u2019s look at that information to get an idea of what the problem is asking: \n\n```\nWe are given that the flats have 6 apartments per floor and 5 apartments per floor and that the apartments can accommodate a maximum number of 4 residents in each apartment. If we take any one of the floors of the block of flats (the 8 th floor, for example) we have:\n\nThe 8th floor has 6 apartments with 5 residents each so 6 x (5 residents each apartment) = 30 residents total.\nThere are 5 apartments with 4 residents each so 5 x (4 residents each apartment) + 6 x (5 each resident apartment) = 50 residents total.\n\nThere are 50 residents total on the floor with a maximum of 4 in each apartment. Therefore there is no available space which brings us to the next floor with 6 apartments.\n\nThere are no apartments not in use (for a maximum of 4 individuals each) so we have:\n\n6 x (4 each).\nThere are 30 residents in total so there is no available space.\n\nThere are a total of 12 floors in each block of flats (one block) and the maximum occupancy for a floor is 16 residents (6 residents in each of 2 apartments for 12 flats). If the maximum occupancy per floor has been reached then the total occupancy for all the floors has been reached and the max total residents has been reached.\n\n\nThe final answer has to be 32 residents.\n\n\nThis is why the statement tells us that the average age for both men and women is 45. We are given the number of residents on each floor and how many are of each gender, but not how many residents there are total.\n\nThe statement tells us that 45% of the residents are males and 55% of the residents have aged 30 years or more.\n\nTo calculate the total number of residents, we add", "answer": " 264"}

{"text": "```\n\nAnswer: This is a problem that requires 4 steps.  You are given the initial weight when the box is empty.  First, I will use division to find out how many jelly beans are in the box using what I know from the question to get to the initial weight and find how many in the box.  After I divide by the initial weight to find the initial jelly beans, I will multiply the answer by 2 because I am looking for the number now in the box.   I will repeat this step again.  Next, I will double each of the results to find the final amount of jelly beans in the box.\n```\n\n### SOLUTION:\n1. The initial weight of 2 lbs when the box is empty and we're looking for how many jelly bears.\n2. We need to determine how many are in the box which means dividing the initial weight by the box's original weight to find out and we got 2 divided by 2 lbs to get 1.  So there is 1 pound of bears in the box.  We then multiply the number 1 by 2 because we need to find out how many in the box in total.  So now there are 2 lbs of bears in the total jar.  We then double this total amount to find out how many are actually in the box and the answer is 4 lbs.\n\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n<# IF response == \"Exemplary\" #>\n<span style=\"color:Blue\">Well done!

I used a calculator to multiply how many grams would equal 28 grams divided by 50 grams,  that would equal the result of 6/5. I then realized that there were 8 ingredients, so I used the long form to multiply 8 by 6/5 after, and I was surprised at the accuracy of my answer! It was close enough to the final product, it was almost indistinguishable! I then thought of this process and remembered when I need to convert between decimal and metric I knew I didn't want to rely solely on my memorisation of these conversions and their formulas, instead I had to think of my newfound knowledge of division with division being similar to finding how much of something is left over when you know how much you need, you can't remember any of the formulas without using your logical reasoning and critical thinking skills that'll be needed in a high stakes moment.\"", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "The company needs ## {3 trucks * (4 miles + 1 mile). * 5} barrels of pitch on the third day.\n\n### Justification:\n\nWe did ##{3} trucks to cover ##{4} miles and ##{3 * 4} trucks to finish ##{5} miles. We now use ##{3 * 5} barrels to finish the last ##{5} miles of pitch.\n\n### Note:\n\nHere ##{3} represents truck, ##{3 * 3} represents ##{9} trucks used, ##{3 * (4 + 1)} represents ##{8} miles and ##{16} trucks used.\n\n### Submission:\n\nThe company uses ##{16} barrels on the day they pave the road. They use the same mixture to pave ##{16} miles of road, so it'll take ##{40} barrels to finish the road.\n\nThe company uses twice as many trucks as they did to pave ##{4} miles of road. They also used twice as much pitch as needed to finish ##{16} (##{4} + ##{2}) miles of road. To finish the remaining ##{8} miles on the ##{40}th barrel, they'll need to use ##{40 / 2} {2} pitch barrels to finish ##{100 % / 100} {2} pitch miles of remaining road.\n\n### Solution:\n\nThe company will need ##{40} - ##{2} = ##{38} barrels of the mixture to finish the remaining road.\n\nThe answer is correct since it uses a mixture of barrels of pitch and gravel. Since there is just pitch and gravel, the ##{38} trucks will each carry ##{30} {100%} {2} pitch + ##{2} {20%} {200} gravel = ##{2} pitch + ##10% {25} gravel.

{"text": "(this is what we should have done)\n1. First we should be clear that the first 30 minutes means 1 batch (3 pizzas) so then 50 mins is equivalent to 2 batches (6 pizzas)\n\n2. Since the oven can fit 2 pizzatons at a time in 30 minutes, 20 pizza's would take 60 minutes.\n\n3. 20 minutes of pizza dough left at this point.\n\n4. 12 batches of pizza's = 12x20 minutes = 240 minutes = 4 hours\n\n### Response 2: It takes 30 minutes for pizza to cook in the oven. So now at the end of 30 minutes, you have made 1 batch of pizza dought that turns to 6 pizza's. Now 1 more batch of dough turns to 3 pizza's. At this point after 1 hour you have made 6 pizza' s and 9 batches so we have 9x20 minutes = to 180 minutes or about 3 hours.\n### Input: It takes 32 hours for the egg and the chicken?\n### Response: Chicken comes before egg because in a farm you let the chicken out but in a rooster is different you just put eggs that aren't fertilized. Also, when you put the chicken on the farm and they are ready, you have to sell eggs. And when you sell, the eggs you sell is called the fertile eggs, not the unfertilized eggs. The unfertilized eggs are kept and just added to the rooster. The fertilized eggs are the ones that are worth more to the market.\n### Input : If one of the eggs on a farm were to crack on it's own, where is it most likely to have cracked?\n### Response 1: The yolk area because when it comes to cracking an egg, you can easily see a crack on the yolk area. But if it would crack on the end, then it is easier to break it because it's on the edge where you break it easily.\n### Response 3: If an egg's yolk breaks, you easily see a small crack,", "answer": " 5"}

If this ever happens to you, your teacher may say, \"I want you to find a way to do it\".  This means that you don't need to come up with a brand-new answer, it just has to be an answer that you think.

{"text": "Input:Johnny has been [playing guitar](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp \"w3schools\") for a while now. He practices the same amount [each day](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-effect-of-practicing-4-hours-a-day-for-a-month \"quora\"), as of *(day) [day] days ago* he had *(*days) as many practices* as he does currently.  How much [days](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/practice \"reference.com\") [have] *(*) have passed*(, so that when he has 3 *times as many*(, he has 3-times as many).  \n\n### Explanation:\nThis is how i was doing it. You will need an equal number from each set, and the middle number in the second set to make this work out, otherwise it will not return a whole number which is fine it just won't solve the problem until you do something with the extra.12. We can subtract 2 from the number and it will be 0, the middle number subtract 1 from the number and it should equal one, and it should work.\n\n### Input 2\nI wanted to do something like this just to see the other possibility. I know there is no way to do what i have done, but i still thought it was interesting.\n\n### Response 2\nTo explain how to get the same answer with your new request, but without the first set. The steps are as follows 1-Make sure you know the steps with the old set, and only use what you need from the other set. 2-Subtract one from how ever many days Johnny has been practicing, and add to the number of days he have with, i used 2 because subtracting 1 put me at 0. 3-Subtract another 2, because the middle number was 2 also because subtracting 1 puts you back to 0. 4-Subtract 3 and leave enough time for 3 more whole days of practice.\n\n### Expected Outcome\nSince both of the above answers i have received are the same, I thought it would be fine to include them both, so", "answer": " 80"}

I cannot make your assignment for you. The user (you) has to do that. I understand \nbut cannot do anything about it. Your teachers/professors need to tell me what to do for you. This is because I have not been assigned anything by you. So, I do not know what you have assigned to me. My assignment is a \nquestion that I have been asked by the user (you). I can help with this by doing as the teacher/professor instructed me to do. This is what I can do. The user can ask me any question or request that they need and I will \nunderstand (I have to make this request/task for you).\n\n### Response (cont'd): If you would like a reminder (you can also use this with your phone or watch) when it is time for a break, you can let me know. You can also tell me to set a timer and I will do it. If you would like me \nto create a timer, you can let me. If there is an alarm/bell that you would like me to tell you about, you can ask me. If you would like a timer/reminder based on your class(es) schedule, I will do what you tell me. \nYou can also ask me about my day. I am happy to tell you about how I did on my tasks or assignments. You can ask me to set as my personal goal to learn how to do a specific task.

{"text": "92\n### Input:\nThe event organizer now wants to find out what the average length of the men in the party is. He is interested in the average of the entire group, not just the men. It must be a whole number, which is why it's an even average. What is the average length of the entire group, in inches?\n\n### Demostration:\nAns:50.25\n\n### Input\nA man and his four children were on a train going to a new home. The man was 3750 cm tall. If the sum of the lengths of the children was 254 cm, what was their ages?\n\n### Answer\n\nThe ages of the children must range from age zero to age 4 because there is a child of age zero and another child of age 4, both are on the train. The sum of the ages of the children cannot be less than the man's age. The sum of the lengths of all the people in the train must also be greater than 3750 to ensure that there is at least one person in the train who is shorter than the man. As a result, one child's age must be greater than 5, but not greater than 4 because there is another child of age 5 on the train. Therefore, one child's is age 3, one child is age 4 and one child is age 5.\nThe average length of those four children is (19 + 22) / 4 cm that is 20 cm. So the height of this man is 3750 - 20 = 3530 cm.\nTherefore the sum of the heights of this man and his 4 children is 4250 cm.\nThere are 4 other men on the train whose heights range from 180 cm to 200 cm, and there is one other women whose height is 178 cm. And there are 3 dogs on the train whose height is 26cm, and there is one dog whose height is 28cm. So the total height of people (man and children and 8 other men and 5 other women and 3 other dogs) are 6310 cm. Then the average of that sum is 3751 cm, which is greater than the", "answer": " 30"}

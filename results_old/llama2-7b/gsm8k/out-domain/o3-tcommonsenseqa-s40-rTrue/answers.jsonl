The question then asks how much time Leo would have taken to finish the third part, if he took twice the time to finish the second part of the assignment. \n\n### Analysis:\nWe know that if one thing takes X minutes to finish the second part  it will take 2X of it to finish the third part. It's implied that the two parts have to be accomplished sequentially, but the time can be split into multiple smaller parts. One can use this formula to conclude that for every 45 minutes that Leo would have taken to complete the second part, he would take 25 minutes to complete the third part.

{"text": "In this question, we are given the following information:\n1. Hans has booked a room in the hotel.\n2. The hotel has 8 floors, with 10 rooms on each floor\n3. Because of an accident on the 8th floor, the last 8 floors are unavailable for guests.\n4. There are no other guests, so no rooms are occupied.\n5. Because of this, the hotel is short of 8 rooms, bringing the total number of rooms available to customers down to 25, with 8 rooms unoccupied.\n6. In this question, we have to find the number of different rooms Hans could check in to.\n7. In each floor of the hotel, there are 10 rooms total, and each room is identical, so there are a total of 100 rooms in the hotel.\n8. As a result, of the original 100 rooms, 25 are available to guests, leaving 75 unavailable due to the accident.\n9. Because Hans is only one guest, there is only one room available for him.\n10. Therefore, there are 25 rooms available for guests, and 75 rooms unavailable, for a total of 15 available rooms for Hans.\n11. Thus, the final count of different rooms Hans could be checked in to is 15.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. It's important to understand the information being presented, which in this case is that the hotel has 8 floos, with 10 identical room per floor, that because of an accident is unavailable for guests. However, there are no other guests around, so no rooms are taken by other people.\n2. This means that the total number of available rooms is decreased, and we need to determine how many potential rooms Hans could be provided with.\n3. To address this, we make use of the available information to evaluate potential candidates.\n4. Firstly, in total, there are 15 rooms available for each floor. We can use this information to determine the number of rooms available on each floor and exclude them (since they've been taken).\n5. Then, since Hans is one of the guests, the number of rooms available to him now drops to one. This is important to remember as we go forward.\n6. As it stands, all floors", "answer": " 90"}

{"text": "If that wasn't enough info, we know how many inches of rain he got, how many gallons he made from each inch, and how much he can sell a gallon for, and we know he had this barrel that could collect rainwater. From that, we subtract how much he could sell and we get the total amount of gallons he made if he was able to sell everything. Therefore, after the calculations, we get 774 gallons. Let's make it simpler. Monday there was 4 inches of rain and in each inch, there was 15 gallons of water. So he collected 4*15=60 gallons. Tuesday there was 3 inches of rain and in 3 inch of rain, there was 12 gallons so he collected 3*12=36 gallons. Then let's add those two numbers. We have 60+ 36 = 96 gallons of water he collected. In one day, he could sell 60 gallons for 115 dollars. In the second day, he could sell what he could sell on the first day. If we add those two numbers and the 14 gallons we had left, we get 60+36+14 = 110 gallons total left. With 110 gallon left, he collected 24 on Monday and 27 on Tuesday. We take 110 total and subtract 24 and 27. So he collected what? He collected 69 gallons. And now for the money. 69 gallons of water cost 69*115=7740.\n\nAnswer: 7740 dollars.\n\n### Input:\"The most effective way to treat my anxiety is a pill, sleeping late at night or a yoga practice.\" Discuss.\n\n### Response:'discuss' means to consider carefully, give your opinion, and state what you thought about it.

Instead of the regular $150, they are offering the product for $100 for a limited time. If Amazon sold 500 of these devices at this 50% lower price for a profit of 50%, what was their total profit?\nRationales:1. The statement suggests that Amazon is offering a great deal as it is a lower price. This implies that the regular price of the device was $150, so we can begin by calculating the profit that Amazon would normally expect to earn from selling the device at this price.\n2. First, we need to determine what the profit margin would be at the standard price of $150. This can be calculated by taking the product's price and subtracting the cost of production, excluding any overhead costs. In this case, we will assume that the cost of production is $0 since the device is a consumer item and does not require heavy machinery or skilled labor to produce.\n\n**$150 - $0 = $150\\*\\*\\*\\*) is the gross profit margin (margin = price - cost of production).\n3. Using the margin (0.5) formula, the gross profit margin for an item sold at the standard price is \\$150, or $150 \u00d7 0.5 = 75.\n4.  Based on this calculation, we can estimate the gross margin profit that Amazon earns for selling a device at the regular price of $15\\*\\*\\*\\* and that the $50 in profit is a % margin of 50%\\*\\*\\*\\**.\n5.  The question now asks how much profit Amazon would earn by selling the device at a 50% discount.

{"text": "Subscription price/promotional price = 18-months subscription price\n= $34\n/0.375\n$90\n- $90\n=$0\n\n### Explanation\nThe key to solving this question is to understand exactly how much a subscriber would save by taking advantage of the promotional offer. The way to calculate this is to determine how much cheaper a 18-month promotional subscription is than a 18- month normal subscription.\n\nCalculating the difference in the cost between a 18-monther normal and a 18-mont promotional subscription is done by taking 34 and dividing it by 0.25. The answer is then compared to the original non-promotional subscription cost. In this case, a $90 difference in what the customer pays between the two subscription types.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1.  It is necessary to convert both price values from a per-issue to a per-month basis. To do this, we first convert both the normal and the promotional prices into 18-month equivalent values which are subsequently converted to an equivalent per-month basis using a factor of 0.375. Here, this means that 900 dollars is equivalent to 24.24 months which is in turn equivalent to a 1.75 dollars per-month subscription fee.\n2.  We take 34 and divide it by 0.3775 which leaves us with a $90 price difference.\n3.  Having determined the difference in cost between the regular and the normal subscriptions, the next step is to convert this value to $ dollars. This is accomplished in two steps. First, we determine what subscription of cost is equivalent to a $ dollar-value subscription through division. To find the answer, we simply divide 90/900 which leaves us with a value of 0.1. Next, we substitute the value into the original question. Specifically, we set 0.1 over three months which is in turn, set over 90 months. Doing so leaves us with a price difference of $0.\n\n### Task:Write a program that prompts the user to enter five temperatures and prints to the console the highest, lowest, and average of these temperatures.", "answer": " 9"}

So each day after she bought some amount of coffee it will only last her for that many days. so now the question is what is the amount of coffee Angie bought because we have to multiply it by 40. This is what she bought - 3 lbs. We know that each lb will brew 4 cups so we multiply 3 by 4.

{"text": "24, because there are 18 tires on the 4 bikes and 18 on the 12 cars.\n\nExplanation:\nWe could start by assuming the vehicles on the lot are numbered 1-24 in a random order. This would mean that we know at least two digits about each vehicles numbered (1 being the number for the bike). \n\nWe also know that we are guaranteed the number of the car includes an even number (i.e. 0 or 2), as in the question, 7 of the 12 cars have spare tires and 6 of those cars are numbered between 4-9, and therefore we are guaranteed 2 even numbered cars out of the 12, and the odd number out of the 11 remaining cars in this sub category is guaranteed to be a bike, which are never numbered evenly. So there are guaranteed to be an equal amount of even and odd numbered cars in the group of 12.\n\nTherefore the next 2 digits of all the car numbers cannot include any number 11 because cars will always have a number of 2 or a multiple of 3 and there are also no 7,02,10 etc. therefore 4 of the 5 car numbered in this category will be at least 5 digits (two digits already mentioned and three numbers) and one is a bike and the last two numbers of any car on the lot cannot be the same as any of the other vehicles (aside from bikes)\n\n\nNow lets repeat those ideas and apply them to the bike numbers, and we know that it is guaranteed that the first two digits of any bike number are either the single digit 1 or the double digit 6. 2 bikes are odd numbered and 4 are even. For the 4 even numbered bikes, we know we can eliminate all even numbers from the odd numbered car numbers and know there is one car number which must contain a 6. (We know bike #6 has a 6 and its the only one in its two even digit group)\n\nThe last two car number combinations (1 and 2, and 11) cannot be in any category of guaranteed numbers (and they are not in any two digit combination which is already in one of those categories) \n\nWe can now cross", "answer": " 84"}

{"text": "Archie started with 100\n\n### Reason: The question statement states \"Archie is playing with marbles outside.\" and asks \"If he has 20 marbles left, how many did Archie start playing with?\" If he only had 20 marbles at the start then it does not make any sense to play with them for 60% percent of the time and then lose half of their number to a sewer. One possible alternative could be that Archie starts at 100 marbles, plays with 60% of the marbles for time which yields 60 marbles and the remaining 40 marbles are lost to the sewer. It's unclear from the question statement if Archie started playing with 100 marble or 20. Therefore, to answer this question we need to assume that Archie started playing with an initial number of 100.\n\n### Example:\n\n### Input:\"I would like to buy a carpet.  A large rug is 3 m and it is 3 000 euros.\"\n### Instruction:\"Find how many kilograms is 1 m of the carpet weight.\"\n### Response: 1145.6\n\n### Reasons:\n**S1:** We need a way to calculate the weight of the carpet, the question doesn't provide additional information.\n**S2:** If it's 3,000,000 euros, it means the cost per Kilo is 2,500 euros.\n**S3:** Multiplication of the weight of a square meter by the cost per Kilo yields the weight of the carpets.\n**S4:** We can plug in the value knowns and the value unknown and solve with Pythagoras.\n\n### Inputs:\"How much is nine minus seven times eight?\"\n> (Note: There is a mistake here, the statement is :\"how much is nine minus 7 times 8?\" The question mark should be missing.

{"text": "He does not know how much time he can hold his breath, but after a week he is able to hold his breath for 20 seconds.  After two weeks, he is able to hold it for 40 seconds, and for 80 seconds, for three weeks.  He now holds his breath 40 seconds longer than last time.  His original goal was to start with 10 seconds, doubling every week. \n\n### Rationale:\n\n- If you look closely at the answer choices, you'll see that 1 second will increase each week.  Brian is doubling his breath holding time at the end of each week, so we also need to double our amount of seconds.  So for example, if Brian started holding his breath for a total of 10 seconds, after one week he will be able to hold his breaths for 10 seconds x 2 = 20 seconds. Once he is finally holding for 20 seconds, he will need to hold on for longer than the 20 seconds in the next week to increase the time.\n\nAfter that, he will need to increase his holding time of 20 seconds by 1 second for each week.  After holding his breath for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds, the next week, he will need to double his breath holding time, again, for 80 seconds.  He does that, and after that week, increases it another 2 seconds.  The next week, he needs to increase the time by 3 seconds.  His original goal to start with 1 second, doubling every week, he will now be holding his breath for 1 second x 5 weeks = 5 seconds.\n\nAnswer:\n- The longest he has held his breath is for 39 seconds.  For the next week, he needs the extra 1 second to finally reach his 10 second goal.\n\n\n### Instructions:Rewrite the statement in the sentence below, replacing the underlined word or phrase with an expression that conveys the intended meaning.\n\nRationales: The question reads, \"He is not a politician, which means...\" The question implies that the person who is not a politician cannot do something, not can he do it.

{"text": "The answer is: 40 total books. The first step is to get Albert's number of books using the given information we have.\n\nStep 1: We can see that \"four times as many\" book refers to 4 as the amount of Stus books, which means Albert has 4 times 9 = 36.\n\nStep 2: The given statement is that Albert has 36 books and Stuart has 9 books. So, the number of books Stuart and Albert altogether have is 9 + 36 = 45 books.\n\nStep 3: The given statement is \"four times as many as Stu\", so using four means we can replace it with \"four x\".\n\nStep 4: The new statement will be \"4 x as many books as Stu\", so using '4 x' will mean we have four x times as many as Stu.\n\nStep 5: Using four times as many as Stus' books, we can say 4 x 4 = 16 times Stu's books and therefore 16 times Stu + 36 = Stus + Albert= \n\nNow substituting the number Stus books to 9 will mean the total number of books equal 9 + 35 = 44 books.\n\nStep-6: Finally, by substituting the number of books Stus have to 9 will mean that the total number of books the two of them have is 9 + (44) = 53 books.\n\nStep Seven: By replacing 4 times Albert's books to the number of Stus books we can say that 9 + ( ( 9 + 39)) = 44 total books.\n\n### Rationale:\nWhen given information to start, in order to simplify the question, we can do division in order to get our answer.

This means that, in one month, the farmer will need 180 bales to feed the 9 horses. The farmer started feeding the horses this year's hay on September 1, meaning he has 125 bales to feed before December 31 or 32 in a month. So we need to find out, how many bales will feed the horses in December? One bale of hay is 60 lb, so this should be 160 lb divided by 9 horses.

This means there have to be as many children as adults going in the elevator (3 adults = 3 children). With a 64lb average for the children, this means the adults will have a 86lb average to compensate, which means that there will be 52lbs of weight difference for the 2 children. \nWith that in mind, we'll know that each child is heavier than 30lbs of the 140lb average, meaning that each child can be 26 or 30 pounds (half and one whole). \n\nNow we need to find the minimum size for the children. We can do this by adding up 600 and each of the weight values for the children to find out what's the second highest number from 600.

{"text": "Input: Reggie and his brother are each taking 10 shots and scoring points based on the distance of the shot from the basket.\nRationales: The scenario involves two players, Reggie and his brother, who are contesting each other. Reggie makes three layups, two free tries, and a long shot. His brother, on the other hand, only scores from long shots. From this information, we can determine the points each player scored. For instance, Reggie scored points for their three layups, which equals to 3 + 2 + 1 =6 points. Similarly, he made two free throws equaling to 2 + 6 = 8 points. Finally, he only scored 1 point from the long shot. Based on these facts, we can conclude that Reggie\u2019s total score is 6+8+1=15 points\n\nReggie and his brother each take 10 shops. Therefore, total scores of both players were calculated to determine the difference after the competition. We can infer that Reggie\u2019s score is 15 and his brother\u2019s score is 4. It implies that Reggie\u2019s lead is 11.\n\nAnswer: Reggie\u2019s score in the competition is 15, whereas his brother\u2019s score in the challenge is merely 4. From this information, it can be inferred that Reggie leads by a total of 11 points.\n\n### Input The price of a soda changed from $1.75 to $2.00. How much money does this represent?

So, we assume that there will be some number of different rock types which doesn't violate anything implied.\n\nTherefore, based on the above, we can see that there are 25 different rock types in a layer which means 25 is the correct choice.\n\n#### (B)  15\n\nThe question says that 'half of the other' which means half of all the rock types other than the limestone type.\n\nWe know there are 4 types of quartz, which is 1/3 of the rest of the different types of rock types other than the five (5) limestone types.\n\nTherefore based on the information given, option B: 15 is the required answer.\n\n#### (C)  1\n\nThe question doesn't define what 'the rest are different kinds of rock'. We can interpret this to mean that each of the rock layers is different from the rest.\n\nAs per the available information, there are 5 types of limestone, 4 quartz, and 4 shale, which has a total of only 1 in one layer. Therefore, we can rule out option C.\n\n#### (D)  5\n\nWe know that shale makes up 'half of the remaining' which clearly indicates that the other rock types are 'the other'. Therefore, the choice is between quartz and other different rock types.\nHowever, there are 12 other different rock types other than quartz and shale, which is far greater than 1/2 of the remaining.\n\nTherefore we can rule out option D.\n\n#### (E)  6\n\n25 is the correct answer for the previous part.

Since we are not told how many dollars Jessica has, but Ian has half of it we know that Jessica has more than 60 dollars. Since Jessica has more than Rodney, we can work out what Ian has. Ian has half of more so half + half is a quarter but since we need the total we add +25 dollars so we have 60 + 25 which is 85. The total for Jessica is Jessica + half Jessica = 100.\n\nSo the answer is D 175, because 100 + 25 is 125 which we add to 100 to make 275 so that 275 - 150(Ian) leaves 125.\n\n### Input :Rick found a beautiful yellow canary which was hiding in his barn.

This was after subtracting all the years in which half was covered. This is where the second half starts. John paid $249, 000 x 2 = $498,6297. This is the total cost over 8 years. This is a fixed amount as it is not paid for every year. After the first, after every 8 years, we have another total cost of $498,900. This money paid over a 8 year period. It is another fixed amount until he gets to the year 17. The children's university tuition is not included in the costs earlier, as it would only begin in the year of 18.

{"text": "> 14 rabbits.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. We can set up a system of equations to solve this question.\n2. There are seven more rabbits and we already have 13 in the cage, so the total number of the rabbits in the cag is 2O.\n3. If 1/3 of the group is removed, the remaining 2/3 of the group will equal to the original 13 which means that the thirteen rabbits form 1/3 of 20 rabbits in total.\n4. To find out the original count, we add seven to 13 which makes 20.\n5. Hence the number of people Jasper sees is 20.\n6. There is no need to consider alternative values because the provided values can be used to calculate the results and there is no chance for any wrong values to be given an appropriate formula to return the accurate results.\n7. Thus, it is safe to say that the answer is 20. \n8. Therefore the correct answer is ________________.  \n20 rabbits.\n\n> Explanation:\nThe question asks, \"...if seven more rabbits are ____ the thirteen in a cage, then the number of rabbits... will be 1/ 3 the number of rabbs that Jasper saw in the \npark today.\" If we assume that Jasper saw 13 rabbits in the park, then 53 rabbits would need to be added to the 15 rabbits in the caged, in order to make the number of rabbits the same as the number that Jasper seen in the park today. \nSince we know that 1/3 of a group is ____ of the others in the group, we can create a formula that gives the ____ number of rabbits.\nSince the rabbits in the park and the rabbits in the ____ outnumber the rabbits in the \ncage, the rabbits in the\nare being ____ 4/9 =.444 of the rabbits in \nthe park and 4/9 = 1/2 of the other rabbits in the cages.\n\nIf we subtract the rabbits Jasper saw from the rabbits he is expecting to find, we get:\n\nThe expected number of rabb", "answer": " 60"}

But the problem is she needs to finish her test.| \n\nLetter A is the 15 keys that have not been cleaned yet, the time is three minutes, which means that one key takes three minutes. If it takes three minutes to clean one key, then it will take 45 minutes to clean all of the letters A (15 keys), and it will take 98 minutes to clean all 15 letters A and her homework. Then, we multiply all the hours by 8650 to convert the time in minutes to seconds. Letter A (15 keys) is one hour and 1 minute. Letter B (14 keys) is one hour. So, the total is 2hrs 25 minutes.

A text is written for a particular reader(s) and provides purpose; the writer(s) of the text select words carefully to create and share its meaning(s). Vocabulary can serve several purposes in informational text.  It can define unfamiliar terms, emphasize main points, or express ideas more clearly, among others. A text\u2019s purpose is determined by who the readers are and what they need to know. Understanding text vocabulary can, therefore, help writers make purposeful selections of words. The goal of this strategy is for students to identify and infer main ideas and key details based on what words tell them about the text\u2019s structure. Students will be provided with text vocabulary words (context clues) that they will use when connecting details to determine main ideas.\n\n### Input : A word in the context that is likely to help you figure out its meaning is called a context clue. Context clues are words or phrases in a sentence that give you information about the definition of the unfamiliar word. When you encounter an unknown word, think about that word's relationship to its neighbors, or the other words around it. These other words can supply clues by defining the meaning or by providing other information about the word's meaning. Context clues help you make accurate inferences about words and sentences.\n\n### Response :\n\n#### Solution\nIn this response I identified the unknown words by taking a look at the different words that surround the unknown word.

{"text": "$0.77\n\n#### Explanation:\n\nLet's start by looking at the last line. It said, if two white socks cost $0.45, and one white sock is $0.25 more than one brown sock, then $0.45 - $0.25 <=> $0.20. $0.20 \u00d7 3 = $0.60, so you would have to pay $0.60 for all fifteen brown socks. It would cost $0.60 \u00d7 15 = 90 cents.\n\nNow let's look at the other two lines. The first line states, \"two white socks cost 161 cents in total\". And the second line states, \"two brown socks cost 75 cents in total.\" One white sock is $25 - $0.45 = $24.55, and one brown sock is $75 - $0.75 = $74.25. (The first part - $24.50 - is what you would pay for all two white socks, and one brown socks.) $24.54 + $0.5 = $25. That's $25, the cost of all two white socks. \"25 = 4.\" \"4\" socks equal to $4. ($4 \u00d7 12 = $48, 3)\n\nTo find the total cost, add \"3\" white pairs \"4 \u00d7 4 = 16\" plus \"15\" brown pairs \"2 \u00d7 5 = 10\" and 15. $0.60 + $0.60 = $1.20, so $1.20 \u00d7 15 would cost $18. To confirm our choice, add $90, the cost of all 15 brown sock pairs, to get $108. $108 + $18 = $126. Which is $126 for all 15 brown pairs plus the cost of all 20 pairs of white socks, for $256 total.

The question describes a process of opening and closing the outlet, then filling the tub without spilling, then repeating the process.

{"text": "Jenny's original amount of money was $144. She spent $24 out of that, which means that she used 1/7 of the original amount. If she spent 1 of the original 7, then she used 1/8 of it. If she spent 3/7 of the original 7 in total, then she must have spent 3/8 of it. That would mean she spent 7 of her remaining amount. To subtract 7 from 144 is to subtract 7 from 8 (the amount that she spent). Then she has spent 1 unit of her original funds, but used 3 of her remaining funds. After that she has $137. And if she spent $24, that's 3 more than 21, so she must have $47. The question is how many units of the original $144 she used. After doing the math, it turns out $47. So the answer is C. After spending 3 out of the 7, she has spent 3 units, but has one left, so she did not use 2 of it, and instead of using all 3, she spent 3, leaving 1 at her disposal. She spent 1 unit of the $24. Then she must have used 2/3 of the remaining 7, leaving 2. In terms of the $144, she spent 1/7, or 14. So she spent 14 units, leaving 21 units. To divide 21 by 3 is obviously to find how many units does 21 divided by 3 equal. That means she spent 7 units, out of 14 that was originally in the original 7th unit, or 7 out of 14.

Now, we can set up our own recipe, making two servings of potatoes and then multiplying it by 30, which is the number of guests. In otherwords, 60 servings will be needed.\n4. Finally, you know what to estimate, divide the total cost of the ingredients for a serving of the potato recipe per serving, which will be 20 cents.

From here, the options are limited to even numbers.\n2. The option of 30 does not follow the premise that one student can only be supported by one bed.\n3. Therefore, since even numbers are consistent with the premise, they must all be valid options.\n4. Since 90 is one of them, the correct answer is E 90.\n5.  As per the premise of one student sitting on each bed, the answer needs to be limited to even numbers.  Since all even numbers could fit, the final option that fits best is 90 as it's an even number.

To find this date, the 32 days will be added to the number of days between those two years. \n3. In every 4 years, there would be an extra day, so if we add 7 days each year, we would end up with 977 days in 5 years. However, since there are only 365 days in a year and 977 divided by 977 cannot give a remainder of 0, so it can't be a leap year.\n4. Adding the 32 leap days in the last two sentences would equate to 977 days and result in a leap year. But since that cannot be the case, another possibility is that the third day of the sequence is either leap day or a leap month.\n5. Similarly, the only possibility for the latter day of the sequence is that it is a leap month or it could be March, April or June, since these are the only months that are multiples of 733 which is the year 733 BC.\n6. Now for a leap month to pass in the sequence of years, the second year in the sequence would have to be a leap year, which is unlikely since the statement gives that the day in question is a day between two other years.\n7.

{"text": "Answers: 113 or 75\n\nRationale: To get to the answer, we need to understand the process and know how it is being asked. Since two vampires turn 5 people every night into vampires, we can count the number of vampires in our sleepy village after two nights.\n\nIf we look at the first night, we have 2 vampires and 5 more people they make become vampires. Which means, vampire count at the end of the first night will be 2+5=7.\n\nIf we think about the second night, we still have 7 vampires and also 5 more people that the 2 vampires make into vampires. Which will become 12.\n\nWe repeat this process to get to the answer of a sleepy village. Therefore, we calculate the village to have 2+5= 7 vampires on the first night, and after 2 nights, the village would end up having 7+5= 12 vampires (vampires).\n\n### Instructions:Choose the correct response to each of the following questions.\n\n### Input :A: You know how to how to how to how...

And 1 tablespoon is equivalent to 1/16 cup.  Therefore, 4 tablespoons make up 1/4 cup so 8 key limes are needed.\n\nInput: Since the extra quantity is 1 cup and 16 tablespoon is equal to 1 cup, we can deduce that 16 tablespooms make up 1 cup.  Therefore, we multiply a 1/16 * 1/2 which gives us 1. So a single key lime produces 1 tablespoon, so we multiply 16 with 16 to figure out how many key lime are needed.  Therefore, 128 key limes are required.\n\nInput: And finally, we know that the extra quantity to make the key lime extra-tart is the same amount as the key lime juice which amounts to 1 cup.

{"text": "`24.25`\n\n### Output:\n![](laundry.png)\n\n### Response Explanation:\n1. Start with the problem statement. Our task is to find how long it will take to complete this entire process in hours. We need to compute the units. This means we need to convert laundry to hours. Based on the question specifications, we need to compute how long each of the loads takes, so it's necessary to solve for the units.\n2. We can start by considering each load as taking around 60 minutes, though it could be quicker or slower based on the conditions. \n3. We can then simplify the problem into calculating the 60 minutes each load takes using our question specification and solve for the units. \n4. Given that each load of laundry is 45 minutes in the wash cycle, this means 60 min/45 min=1.33 hours each.\n5. Given that each load is 1 hours in the dry cycle, this means 1.00 hours for drying each.\n6. There are 8 loads in total, so our total time for each load is (1 hour x 8 loads), which is 8 hours.\n7. Our final computation is then 8*60=480 and then divided by 45/60 (1.33), which is `24.25`.\n8. The solution follows.\n\n### Feedback:\nIt must be noted that the solution can be modified based on the variables in the specific question.", "answer": " 14"}

'Awesome' doesn't necessarily mean Peter thinks a lot or that he thinks really well; he just means he has positive emotions towards the news of his favorite restaurant reopening and thinks it is great.\n3. The question is asking to determine if Peter has 'thought well' in the context of the information given. \n4. Option A 'thinks only' implies that Peter hasn't thought about anything else other than his favorite restaurant reopened which seems illogical in the context of his positive response. \n5. Option B 'thinks a lot' is also illogical because it means that Peter thinks more than necessary.\n6. Option C 'hardly thinks' suggests that Peter doesn't think at all about the news of his favorite reopening, but in this sentence, he has demonstrated positive thinking and enthusiasm. It is contradictory with his positive response.\n7. Therefore, the only possible answer option is D, 'thinks well'.\nAnswer: D: thinks well\n\n### Input:\"I've got enough energy to walk up one hill\", says John. This means the following? Choices: A. John has got energy to walk up two hills. B. John has got energy for three hills, but not more. C. John doesn't have enough energy to walk more than one hill. D. This could mean John has enough energy to walk up any hill E. John has got too little energy to walk.\nRationales: Input: John is describing what is possible for him to do, which is walk up one hill.\nOption A: 'Enough energy to walk up one more hill', this is actually implying John has enough energy for at least one more hill due to the phrase 'but not more' which would imply that he has no more energy.\nOption B: 'Not enough energy to walk", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "$60\n\n\n### Demand:Provide an explanation and justify the approach that you will take.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question is about a babysitter who charges $12 per hour. The context of this question is clear in that the babysitter did 50 minutes yesterday, but the amount she earned is not specified. To answer the question, we need to apply the context to the problem: The babysitter's charge is $12 per hour, so to calculate the amount she earned in this scenario, we need to find the cost for 50 minutes' worth of babysitting by dividing the hourly charge by 60, and then multiply this number by 50 to get the cost for 5 hours. To confirm this approach, we can compare it to a similar situation in which somebody takes 5 hours and earns $120 total, which is equivalent to $12 per hour for a 5-hour period. In the scenario provided, we can calculate that the babysitting cost is $12 divided by 60 multiplied by 50, which is equal to 60, which is the correct answer. The approach can be explained by using the context and reasoning in the scenario, rather than explicitly defining the approach.\n\n### Input : The car ran out of fuel.

We can use the information we have to calculate the total usage time since the question mentions that it had a full tank originally, so if the total time from when it was full to when it ran out of fuel equals 1, then the usage duration would be 1 - 6:00 PM = 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM = approximately 3 hours.\n### Insta :\nGive an explanation of how to calculate the time from when the car's tank was full to when it runs out of fuel.\n\n### Resp :\nThe car's tank held 3/4 of a gallon of fuel, or", "answer": " 10"}

To understand what the question is attempting to ask next, we need to break down the possible ways someone might walk or run in a hurry.\n3. Each of the potential answer choices is plausible and reasonable, but we need to find one that is more plausible than the others.\n4. Option A 'walks' implies someone walking is in a hurry, but also makes it sound as if he was walking at a normal fast pace. \n5. Since we have already established that the man was in a hurried state, this is not the correct answer. However, option B 'runs' is suitable as a state of an action that signifies one has a lot to do in a hurried state.\n6. Option C'skis' could be used to describe a hurried state but is not necessarily needed to do so and the question is clearly asking how to describe one that moves.\n7. Option D", "answer": " 35"}

Take out your hairpin and slide it in between the door's slats. Rationales: 1 ) We first notice that the question is asking what to do if you've forgotten your house key and your doorknob.  This implies that there exists a door and a doorknob.\n2 ) Since there is only one right answer, we know immediately that we can eliminate options B, C, and D.\n3) Option A should not be chosen.  No one would want to tear the door off of its own hinges because this would be expensive to repair afterwards.\n4) Option C: Wait until your husband comes Home. This option is incorrect because waiting for a husband to come home might be necessary for a few situations like if there's an intruder in the house and she's unable to scream for help. However, it should not be done if one simply misplaced a key or forgot where he put it.\n5) Option E: Take out your hairpin. Hairpin is an object designed to help open a locked door, but it's rarely used in practice today because modern locks and doors are more reliable and durable.

{"text": "Mark has an animal race. Let me show you the data I have so far for how fast animals can run down a sidewalk. I can run 10 feet/sec., or 1 mile/min. The hares' average speed is 10 feet per second, and the turtles' is 1 foot per second. It's gonna be simple, I can tell you this. Since they're animals too, we can assume their speed doesn't vary much. If you run a quarter mile, one of these animals could cover the distance in less than a second. Now, this one requires math. To make it easy for you, I'll explain how to do it by analogy. Imagine there's just a guy who runs a quarter mile every day and runs a 20 foot course as fast as he possibly can. That guy's speed is 10/4, or 1/2 the distance the hares and turtles run. The turtle's speed is 20 seconds per 1 MI., or 4 times slower than that guy. If turtles ran as fast as that guy, how long would a race of 20 feet take them to run? It'd be 4 times as long (40 seconds), or how long it takes hare to run the same track. That means turtles are running 4 times slower. Turtles would complete that track in 4 times longer to reach the end, or the hare would simply finish a quarter mile before a turtle could even start it. To help solve this question, let's create an equation. 1/2 * turtle = hare because I know he's running 10 seconds per quarter mile, and turtles are running at 4 seconds per quarter mile. That's 20 seconds. What is 20 seconds? It's four quarter miles, so I multiply: 1/2 * 4 and the answer is 1/2 of 4 and I get 2. So to help solve this, what we'll do is say: turtle run 20 feet/sec and then multiply that by 10.

By solving for the difference in prices, you found that Mary's purchase price from John was $30.\n\n### Feedback\nYour solution is right, but this question is ambiguous as it only asks to compare the large purchase, \nwithout asking if Mary paid it herself, John paid it for, or both.\n\nThis is an example of an ambiguous question and a response that provides an accurate value without \nexplaining how the correct answer was reached.\nAsking someone to explain their reasoning is more effective than simply assessing a response for its accuracy.\n\n### Rationale", "answer": " 175"}

My collection currently stands at 300,  which includes 4 more Buicks than Fords, with 3 more Fords than Chevies, and  I've decided to sell some of the cars I don't need. I'll start with the Ford cars, because they hold the least sentimental value to me, and will sell 3 of them. After doing this math, the following results are arrived at:  I have a total of 294 Buicks.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The total number of model cars is 301, meaning there are 301 \u2013 300 = 1 model cars left.\n2. Out of 301 model cars, Jim has 4 more Buick than Fords.  Therefore, with 300 models left, the number of Buicks he owns can be calculated as 300 - 4 = 296 Buicks.\n3. Next, Jim has 3 times the number of Fords as Chevies.  This ratio implies that he has 3 more Fords.  Therefore with 296 models total, he should have: 3 Fords + 4 Buicks = 7 models remaining, meaning 301 - 7 = 294 Buick models.

The first instances of written arithmetic can be traced back to Sumer circa 2200 B.C. For thousands of years, the practice of mathematics has evolved. While the ancient Sumerians were one of many peoples to experiment with mathematics and make mathematical discoveries, the ancient Greeks had a greater influence on the development and acceptance of mathematics. Aristotle and Plato's work in geometry and philosophy had a major impact on the philosophy of mathematics teaching and learning. According to Birkhoff and Darrigol (2003)[3], \"The Greek style, which dominated mathematics until the time of Galileo\", is characterized by a certain level of mysticism and the belief that mathematics should only", "answer": " 84000"}

We do not need to do this for Fred only, as he is simply a comparison point and is not directly linked to the question. \n\nWe can find Fred's original salary from the question \n```\nA month ago, Fred earned $300 more than Mike.\n```\nThis information points to the fact that Fred earned $684 ($300-$284) in the month before, i.e. five months ago.\n\nFor Mike, the question explicitly states that he earned $750 five months ago.\nNext, we calculate the percentage increase in Mike's salary:\n```\nMike's salary 5 months ago: $750\n50% increase: $1000\nSo the percentage increase Mike earned is 1000x50% which is 50% of 1000.\n```\n50% of $1000 is $500. \nAs we stated earlier, Fred earned 300 more than his original salary each month (in the five-month time period), this means that his salary now also increased by 300 in the last month.\n```\nFred's salary now: $100\n300% increase: $300 \nSo the percentage increase Fred earned is $300x300% which equals $900.\n``` \nCombining these two percentage increases, it is fair to conclude that Mike's salary 6 months ago was 500 + 900 = $1400.", "answer": " 15400"}

Each person could have chosen one, however, to arrive at that number, we must take one away from 2 and one away from 3, adding them together gives 8.\n3. This, however, does not eliminate the two person problem.\n4. To do that, we need to know the total number of each drink.\n5. In the first part (wine), there are a total of nine (9).\n6. In the second part (soda), there are a total six (6) beverages.\n7. In the final part (both drinks), there must be a minimum of a total of both (9+6) of drinks, meaning that you could have one or two (since 1 + 2 = 3 and 6 + 9 = 15, there is no number above 15 to represent all of these drinks).\n8. Subtracting the total of one by adding it to the total of two, the answer is (nine minus one is eight, adding one to six gives an 8 also), nine (9) minus one is eight (8).\n9.

If we look at it, we see the numbers involved are of no use to coming up to the answer. In such cases, we should include their count in order to get an estimate(approx) or a total.\nThen, we can think of 2 ways in which the question can be answered:\n(a) First one is to say I have more pigs than goats, because I have lesser pigs than cows. (Simply)\n(b) Second one is to say I definitely have more goats than pigs and I still have more pigs than cows, because I have more pigs (only pigs) than goats\nHence, goats is more than pigs so definitely I have more goats than cows.\nNow, we know we will definitely have more goats, we don't know how many. If we look at the input,\nwe see that to get the answer that I would have got 100 goats more than cows. Here, 4 more crows and 12 more cows are the same numbers, hence it cannot be concluded that I have more goats now.\nSo, we will find how many goats I will have if we get 100 more goats.\nAs per logic, there cannot be more than goats, so we will take '100', which is the required amount.\nSo, we get '100' more goats, making it '66' goats and since I have 56 animals, I must definitely have '10' goats.\nSo, the answer is '10' since the goats are also counted in the '100', as it is required and cannot be more than 50.

We don't know the number of fish in it. \n6) But since she had 8 goldfish, 4 angelfish, and 20 angelfishes in total, her aquarium has 26 fish in total, so Catriona has a total of 13 fish. \n7) Subtracting the goldfish and angelfish together leaves us with just the numbers of guppies. \n8) We don't know how many guppies each kind has or the number of guppies in total. \n9) So she has 20 guppies + 20 goldfish + 4 angelfish = 44 fish in total. The final count of goldfish is 13 + 13 = 26, and, since she has twice that, she has just one goldfish.\n10) Similarly, she has just one guppy, or she has twice the number that she has goldfish.\n11) The same goes for angelfish, which means she has twice as many goldfish as angelfsh, or once each goldfish and angelfsh, or one goldfish, one guppy two angelfish total of 12 or 13 fish in her aquarium.

{"text": "The answer is 32 pounds.\n\n#### Demonstration: \nThe question states that the standard price of a dozen of fresh strawberries is 20 dollars (20 x 16 = 32). This means that someone who paid $128 paid 128/20 = 6.4 (rounded up to 6) pounds. They picked 6 pounds times 8 = 48 strawberries. However, the people get a 4 dollar discount, thus they only get charged 116/20 = 5.8 pounds. This is 32/5.8 = 5.76 (rounded up to) strawberries for each pound sold. In the above scenario, they pick 32 pounds (48*5.8 = 268 ~ 270). \n\n### Rationales: \nThe question starts with a strawberry picker paying a total amount of $128 (6 pounds of strawberries x $20 dollars). However, he pays $4 entrance fee, which includes 4 pounds of strawberies. To calculate the cost of the remaining 6 pounds of strawberry picked, we divided the cost by the amount harvested and multiply it with 6 pounds. The answer is 6.4 (5.8 * 6) which matches the average cost of $128 divided by 6 pounds of stawberry harvest (16/4). \nTherefore, the answer is 6.8 (rounded up to a whole number).\n\n\n### Input For The Second Answer:In a city of 4000 people, there are 106 houses.

The questions implies that the small town is in the middle of nowher and you want to know how to get to it. We can infer that the small town is very far away from the city and that's the reason why it's hard to get there.\n2. In this case, 'by car' doesn't seem like a viable option, as its unclear what'middle of nowhere' means in the case of geography. 'Car' may refer to a car that can go off-road, but we're still unsure if the small town is in fact a 'desert' which makes 'by car' not a good answer.\n3. Similarly, 'by bus' might be suitable during daytime, but it may not guarantee a safe trip during night as the bus might stop anywhere at any time and it might also fail to make it to such a remote location. This is probably why there is a small chance of 'by bus'.\n4. Next, 'by foot' is out of question since the town most likely lies too far away and the person doesn't have enough time to walk to the village. Also, they don't know where exactly the village is located, so the journey is way too risky.\n5. Finally, 'by tire' might be possible if the person knows how to deal with a flat tire and if there's a well-made trail going to the small village. Or else this is not a suitable way to get to the remote village by tire.\n6. To solve the question we look for an answer that is the exact opposite of 'by tire'.\n7. From there, it should be easy to figure out the most appropriate answer.\n8. The one that follows suit is 'by a road'. A safe and easy way of reaching the village given the above answers is by a well-made road to the small village which fits the requirements of the question perfectly.\n\n### Input:- 5/3 or -2/1? \n\n### Response:-1\n\n### Demostration:\n\n### Input\n\n- 3/5", "answer": " 145"}

But this is a flawed logic, because people may or may not turn up to the reception and the remaining may consist of relatives or may be from the bride or the groom's side of the family.

{"text": "$132, because 13 x $8 - 4 x $23\n\n### Input:'Most' can mean what? Choices:A: common B: rare C: typical D: significant E: normal\nRationales:1. The statement \" 'Most' can mean which of the following?\" indicates that we should consider an alternative for the meaning of most.\n2. The possible interpretations are A: common, B: rare, C: typical, D: significant, E: normal.\n3. These choices do not help us to determine the exact interpretation of most because they are not distinct in meaning. For example, 'A: common' could be defined as 'having a particular characteristic or quality in common,' and 'C: typical' as 'tending to conform to or be exemplary of a type or class.' These two choices define the same meaning, so it cannot necessarily be excluded from the choice.\n4. Therefore, we must consider the option E: normal, which is defined as 'being in accordance with the majority of cases.' \n5. 'Normal' is typically used to describe behaviors, but here it is used to describe the meaning of most. However, in this context, it does not necessarily correspond to behaviors since it could refer exclusively to the meaning of'more than half.'\n6. We are looking for an alternative interpretation of most, so we can eliminate 'A: common,' 'B: rare,' and 'C: typcial' because they don't necessarily provide an alternative meaning for most. 'D: significant' is not the answer either since it doesn't strictly refer to the number of cases in which this is the case, but it could be related to qualitative values related to the context.\n7. Therefore, the only option left is E: normal, because'most' could mean 'the majority,''very,' or 'above half.' Although it doesn't explicitly state that'most' implies the same meaning as 'above half,' the context of the question strongly suggests that this should be the case. In conclusion, the correct answer is E: Normal.\n\n\n### Input:\"Having a college degree doubles one's expected lifetime income.\" What could the author mean by \"expected lifetime income\"?\n\n### Response-It is not directly stated, however, a lifetime refers to the duration of a person's life.", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "He rode 25 miles. \n\n### Demostration:\nInput: My brother is only 10 years younger than me, but he's the exact opposite in personality, and he's only half my height.  He has dark brown eyes. Choices:  A= he's 5'5\" B= he's 30 C= 80 years old D= wears brown pants E= 40 years old F= has green eyes\nRationales:\n1. We can determine the exact personality of my brother by studying the contrast between the descriptive details. My brother is the complete opposite in personality than me; he's only half of my height; he has dark eyes, and other details of this sort reveal that he is younger.\n2. The question now asks one of the following variables:  age,  personality,  height,  pants color,  eyes color. It's clear that the age is not mentioned in the statement, so that's the one we will focus on.\n3. Age information was given for my brother: he's 10 years younger, meaning he was born 10 years after me. Let us say my birthday is: I was born in 1970.\n4. A: The first answer choice indicates that he's 5\u20195\u201d. The given information about my brother implies that he's 6\u20196\u201d or taller,  which is impossible since we already know he's half my height, which by default means he's not taller than 6\u20193\u201d.\n5. B: This choice indicates that he'll be 30 years old.  I was born in 70, therefore, he'll be born in 80, which is impossible because I'm older than 30.  He's not 30 years old!\n6. C: A simple calculation of 30-10 = 20 shows that he'll be born exactly 20 years after me. 20 years after 1970 is 1990, and he'll be born that year.\n7. D: The given information about my eyes, which are brown, doesn't give clear indications to the color of my brother's eyes. However, the information doesn", "answer": " 12"}

For example, let's say the picture in question was of 40 people arranged in a line. At the 40th person is the lady with the earrings. The person at the end is the last person, who is also the 40th. So the first person would be the 39th person, 40 -1 = 39. \nBut as we have established 'The woman is wearing earrings' 'first' means 'first' and not last.

Divide the total 110 legs of the tables and chairs by 100 to convert to percents; you end up with 1.10%. This isn?t possible as 110 legs aren?t a remainder of 40% of 100 legs.\n\nB. If the table legs equal 71.40, the chairs equal 4.60, and the final result is 37.40, divide by 71.4 to get 52 remaining legs. This is too high in the number of remaining legs. \n\nC. Dividing 4.60 by 40% leaves a remainder of 0.32, so the number of available chairs will be 97.68 which is far too high.\n\nD. Using the information from previous options and dividing 3650 by 2 yields 1825 legs. The result is only three legs below the correct answer.\nE. 110 legs is 9.09%. Using this as an estimate for furniture legs remaining, dividing by 1.10 doesn?t reach a result close to the number of legs correct answer yields.

This means that one mile can also be considered as 100 metres, which is 1.6miles per hour.\nGiven that a mile is 1,766 feet, we can now rewrite the first and third options using this conversion:\n\n> 1 mph = 5 feet per second (5 ft/s)\n\n> 1 mile/hour = 5 feet / minute\n\nThis helps us to see that the two options (A,B) are equivalent and we only need to choose one of them for our calculation.\n\nFor option A, we have the formula:\n\n> speed = distance / time\n\nSince speed is constant, we can substitute time with the following formula: t = t1 + t2\n\nTherefore the final speed formula becomes:\n\n> s = d / (t1 + t2)\n\nWith the values of d and t given in the question (d = 210 ft; t1 = t2 = 19.65 seconds), we can plug them in to the formula and get:\n\n> s (speed in feet/second) = 210 / (19.65 + 19.66) = 44.5 feet/second\n\nSince d = 210ft, the speed is represented by the equation: s = 44.4 feet/second\n\nOption B uses the same conversion, although it may be used for convenience rather than to represent the mathematical equivalent used in option A. We can then get the same speed using equation\n\n> speed = 44.6 ft/sec\n\nThis means that s = 44 ft/second\n\nSince the initial position is 210 feet and the initial speed is 44 feet per second, we can now substitute the values and get:\n\nPosition at start = 210 feet\n\n> Position at start = 3040 / 44 feet / second\n\n> Position at finish = 210 + (3965 seconds/44 feet/second)", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "It costs the town a total of 105 trash cans\n\n### Analysis and Explanation:\nThe total number of trash cans to be paid by the town is 105. The city has to pay twice the necessary amount in a day. It can be done by increasing one by eight times at the location of stores. This is done on account of the public that is not aware of throwing trash in the cans. So, the town will have to make another 25 trash cans and pay a total amount of 105trash cans. Hence we get 2 \\* 25= 50 trash cans which will be placed at the entrance of shops and the store owners will still need to pay for the same amount of trash for each day. This 25 trashcans will be used for shops located on the high tourist roads. After this, for the remaining 75 cans, the public which is not aware of the trash bins will throw their trashes anywhere around the street. So, the public is using 3 trash cans per person in the remaining cans on a daily basis. As we want each person to drop trash in a trash can, the cans will now have 8 persons daily than 3 persons. After 365 days at the remaining cans which is an extravagant amount of 3 times trash and 365 days extra there will be no more trash and the streets will be clean.", "answer": " 42"}

{"text": "3\n\n### Explain:  The rule Mary and Frank used to calculate what Luna ate was to double all the feedings given after the morning meal.  I've applied that same rule for the afternoon meal, doubling the amount of kibble Luna got in the afternoon to reach her evening meal, and then double that value again to reach her morning meal.  The extra kibble given to Luna in the evening matches that in the morning, so after both are doubled, each morning's feeding equals the total amount given to her (in this case, 2 cups) in the previous afternoon.  Therefore, 3 cups remain.\n\n### Rationale:  Mary and Frank used the rule that all subsequent feedings are double the amount given previously.  If the given amount in the morning is 2 cups, all subsequent feedings (that is, afternoon and evening) are 4 cups each, so 7 cups (4 + 4) are doubled to 14 cups (2 * 7).  The next morning, Luna starts over again, so the total amount given that day is 2 cups.  That amount, when doubled, equals 3 cups.  Therefore, 6 cups, plus the 2 cups that remain after dinner, equals 8 cups out of the 14 cups that were given to Luna.  To reach the number of cups remaining, we take 8 cups, subtract the 2 cups Luna had left, and multiply by 2.6, representing the initial amount each feeding was one-half of what the corresponding feeding had been.  The remaining cups (1 or 2 cups) represent the fraction 0.5, which is one-half.  The remainder is 3, which is the number of cups left over.\n\n### Input:\"How much is three times seven?\"\n\nThe correct response is 7 + 3 = 10\n\n### Rationales:\n1. We'll start by breaking down the sentence. 'How much' is 'what?', so 'what is three times seven?'.  Three times seven is 21, which is ten more than seven (not to be confused with 'ten').\n2.

Each person having two tally marks indicate that the person had two different choices of food.\n2. Looking at the options given: Tuna Salad: 6 people, BLT: 8 people.\n3. Taking the first and the tally mark, '12'.\n4. It is evident that 6 tally marks come under BLT and 8 tally marks under Tuna Salad.\n5. We can find the tally marks for Tuna Salad. Therefore the answer is, 6 + 8 = 14 people.\n6. The question now asks for how much were the BL T's?\n7. To answer this, we need to subtract BL T's from 14 with the understanding that the answer would have been tally marks. \n8. The question also asks us to identify the answer.\n9. Looking at the options, we can discard the ones that can't be subtracted from 14.\n10. We can safely conclude that the rest two options are the correct ones.\n11. BL T's were given 6 people in Tuna Salad. To get the BL T'S we have to subtract 6 and get 8. \n12. Hence, the answer is, 8.\nAnswer: B: 8.\n\n### Task 1\n\n### Instructions:\nFor each of the questions below, write 2", "answer": " 50"}

{"text": "Fatima had 15 customers who did not buy coffee, that week.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. Fatima served 25 people coffee, at her restaurant: 25% of the total number of customers. Since, 3/5 of the total number of people came to buy coffee, then the other 2/5 customers bought something else. The number of customers who bought coffee and the number of customers who bought something else is equal to the sum of all the customers. \n2. To calculate the customers who bought coffee, we divide the total number of customers in half (1/2). \n3. To get the number of people who did not buy coffee 1/2*3/5 + 2/5 = 2/5 * 3/5 +2/5. \n4. In simpler terms, out of 15 customers, 2/5 of the total customers went to buy coffee. \n5. Hence, 2/5 \u20131/2 = 2/5 \u2013 1 = 1 customer (the other customer bought coffee) \n6. So, out of 16 customers served coffee, there were 15 that bought food, drinks and/or coffee and 1 that didn't buy food, drinks and or coffee.", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "We can answer this problem using an algebraic equation.\n\n1. To begin with we need to understand the quantities of dog food in relation to the dogs' needs. Each dog consumes 1.5 cuprs of dog food and the first dog consumes only this amount of food while the second and third dog consumes 2 times more than the first dog and 2.5 times more than the second dog, respectively. We have the relation between dog food and dog needs.\n\n2. To find the amount of dog food Hannah should prepare in a day for the three dogs, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food all three dogs need and the amount of dog food that each dog takes.\n\n3. For the total amount we have this formula: 1.5 + 2 times 2 = 15 cups. Which means that in a day all the three dogs collectively need 15 cups of dogfood.\n\n4. Each dog will take the quantity according to dog # in total so in case of the first dog need of 1.5 cuperns the dog will take 1.5 cuppers of dog food. The same applies to the second dog but it will take 1.8 cuperns and the same will be for the third dog but it will take about 2.2 cuperns.\n\n5. Therefore, we can find the total amount of dogfood that should take Hannah. We have three different dogs and as they need more or less than the first dog we can say that we have three different amounts of dog food for the three dogs. In addition we can say that the third dog takes the 0.08 cupers more than the second one, which means that it is 2 time more like the second one.\n\n6. After gathering everything we can set this equation to solve. For the first one we have 0.3 cuperns for the second one and 0.08 additional cuperns and for the third one.\n1/3 x 2x 2.2 = 1/3 x 1.5 +.1 cuperns = 1.425 cuperns of food. The answer is 1.42 cuperns. So the answer is: Hannah should prepare about 1.42  cuperns of dog food for the day.", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": "Alex has the remainder (of his weekly income) $435.00\n\n### Incorrect response:\nAlex has the remainder ($435.05) of his weekly income.\n\n### Justification:\nFirst, we need to understand the question asked. It states that Alex's weekly income is $500.\nNext, we need to understand how he has to deducted a portion of that income to calculate the remainder.\nThe tax to be deducted is 10%.\nAdditionally, he pays a weekly water bill of $55.\nThereafter, the tithe is 10%. Alex's tithe, or weekly charitable donation, is determined by dividing his weekly salary by 10 and then subtracting it.\n\n### Therefore, when it comes to calculating his total available funds, Alex has a weekly income of $500, which is deducted by 10% for tax purposes, which leaves him with $435.

The reader has no inkling as to what this outcome will be from the first paragraph alone, however, the second paragraph reveals that the twins do not die. This would lead the reader to believe that perhaps one lives and one dies, or they simply move away.

She advised that they make an entirely new plan. What was the students' view of the situation?

A and B do not offer a view as to anything that happened in the past or the previous decision to stay and continue.\n2. C implies that the situation was very dangerous, and that they should proceed, so they didn't need to make a new plan, i.e. they stayed the way it is and should continue.\n3. In contrast, D refers specifically to the plan to proceed, so the situation was too dangerous for that, so they needed to change their decision.

{"text": "He can afford to go to the doctor at all; if he couldn't then he wouldn't be able to go at all.\n\n### Answer:None\n\n### Instructor Feedback:\nThis response is correct.  When Tom goes to the discount clinic, it takes two visits to diagnose his condition instead of one.  Because the clinic is more affordable, he is able to go and visit the doctor, but it does ultimately cost him more than if he'd gone to the regular doctor.\n\nRationales:1. The question states that Tom can afford to go to a doctor at all, meaning that his income is sufficient for him to cover the costs of going to a doctor.\n2. If he could not afford to go to the regular doctor, then he would not be able to go at any cost, hence his income would not allow him to afford the medical services.\n3. The question then mentions that the discount clinic is affordable and that it took two visits instead of one.\n4. Taking these details into consideration, we can infer that he actually spent more money going to the discount clinics, even though it was cheaper.\n5. The final question then asks about the cost saving difference between going to a discount clinics and the regular one.\n6. The answer choices indicate money saving rates. We can note that the discount clinics are 70% cheapest, whereas the regular clinics are 100% more expensive.\n7. Since Tom went to a discount clinical for 120%, he did not save any money. \n8.

We cannot solve the weight subproblem until we have the densities. If we are told only the final weight, we can solve the mass subproblem, which is the more basic subproblem.\n\nIf we determine the densities, we can then solve either subproblem for the desired outcome (the final weight). \n\n#### Subproblem 1 - Determine the densities:\n\nWe know that the final weight is the sum of the weights of each of the types of candy combined.\n\nBecause the quantity of each type of candy was constant, the mass would be multiplied by the density.\n\nThe density of brownies is 1x10=10x grams/ounce (0.1 pounds)\n\nThe density of jellybeans is 13x10=13x grams/ounce(0.1514 pounds)\n\nThe quantity of jelly beans was 20x10=20x grams(4.4 pounds)\n\nBut the quantity of jelly bears was 15x10=15x grams(2.21 pounds)\n\nTherefore, the density of jelly bears is 2.21/4.4 =0.518451 pounds/ounce\n\nLikewise, the quantity of gummy worms was 40x10=40x grams(8.8 pounds).\n\nBut the quantity was 30x10=30x grams (5.66 pounds)\n\nTherefor the density would be  5.66/8.8=0.641666 pounds per ounce\n\n#### Subproblem two - Determine the final weight:\n\nAssuming we know the weight of all the types of candy, including the total amount of jelly bears and brownies, we can use the density to calculate its final weight.\n\nWe need to sum the weights.

To deduce this, the first thing to do is to determine the amount of buildings in a given earthquake, and from there deducing how many buildings were collapsable in total.\n3. We can determine the amount that buildings collapsed in an earthquake by looking up the question: An earthquake caused four building to collapse, meaning that in the first earthquake there were only four buildings collapsed.\n4. However, the problem with this is that the question asks about how many buildings collapsed in total, after the fourth earthquakes, which means we have to determine the amount of collapsable buildings after counting the first one.\n5. After looking at the Earthquake's collapsable buildings, we can note that the three previous earthquakes added six more buildings, by the end of the fourth earthquakes there are a total of ten buildings collapsed.\n6. With this information we can figure out how many buildings are collapsed after the fourth earthquacks, the number to be determined according to the question above.\n7.

There are two options - A and B. \n3. Let us look at each of them to deduce the appropriate answer. \n4. Option A - 'She was so smart that she\ncould not believe it herself'.\nThis option refers to her being so smart that it is hard for her to trust her intuition. For instance, if she is good at solving complicated equations, it might seem easier to her to just take shortcuts instead of trusting her own reasoning to work it out.\n5. Alternatively, she might not trust herself because she feels that her competence is too great for her job and is scared of letting herself fail in anything. (E.g.: A teacher might believe that she is not good enough to teach. This results in her not teaching as competently as she can.)\n6. Hence, it does not imply that the smart girl is arrogant and cannot trust her own cleverness.\n7. B -'she could not trust her own\ncleverness'.\nThis option is opposite to that of A, and implies her arrogance. She wouldn't be arrogant if she were able to trust her own cleverness in her work.\n8. It is also true that she may not trust her own clevernees if she believes that her work is too above the standards that her workplace has set.

{"text": "Shawna only needs to reach her goal on Wednesday and she should not count the ones she was able to do on Tuesday.\n\n### Rationale:We can use the \"Pythagorean Triple\" for this question - the following question will require that we set up a math problem for Shawna to figure out her new goal. So if the smallest integer is 3, then we can use it to help us figure out the new goal. As it says Shawna needs to do 30 sit-ups, we know that our two other numbers (which are the \"legs\" of the pythagorean triple) would need to add up to what? So the new question would be what total do we need to give Shawna to help her have the required 2x30 sit-ups. \nWe can figure this out by subtracting the new target number from the first goal number.\nThe first goal Shawna had was 30 sit-us, so what is our start number? 30\n\nWe subtract and we get 2x30 - 30 = 2(x) \nWhich is our answer. We want the total to be around 150 so we subtract our new end goal once again and get (30-150= -120) \nOur new goal would be 2x120 = 240 or 120 sit-ups more than the original.

Based on the data and information presented in the question, we can conclude that the race will be 7 days long. If we assume that the number of days is 7 and the total distance is 30 miles, we can find the average distance Jesse and Mia are expected to run by dividing 30 miles by 7 days:\n\nJesse runs 30 miles for 4 days and Mia runs 3 miles for 4 days, giving us an average of 1.12 miles per day.\n\nIf they continue to run the same pace for the rest of the 3 days, the average of their averages would be 2 miles per day. \n\n### Reasoning:\nThe question states:\n\nJesse and Mia have one week to run a total of 15 miles. They are both running slowly.\n\nSince the number of days is one week and the number of miles is 15, the answer choice is option D: 2.5.\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Reasons:\nBased on the context of the question, we can infer that Jesse and Mias' target goal of the race is to run 15 miles collectively. \n\nThe question states that they are both running slowly and the answer to the questions is 2.5 which is the average of their averaging of 1.1/1.2 miles per day over the course of the week long race.

Therefore if she had typed for 38 minutes during breaks and then typed for 22 more minutes, then that means she had 616 - 38 = 578 sentences at the end of today. \n9. Therefore, the correct number of sentences Janice had at the beginning of the day is 578 \u2013 616 = -38 sentences. \n10. According to rule of subtraction, a negative number means it\u2019s one less than the given number. So -38 = 38 \u2013 38 = 175 sentences.\n11.

To start with, 4 x Benedict's house must be the square root.\n2. To start off, you need to solve for Benedict's house, subtracting the numbers from each other to get there.  7600-4000=3600. \n3. By squaring both numbers and adding them together, you will find Benedict's house is close to 3600. (600 x 6=3600)\n4. By subtracting the number from its square, you will get your answer.\n5. Subtract (3600/ 2) which is about 1800\n6. Finally, square root of 1800 is near enough 6, so Benedict's house area is close to 600.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe numbers here are pretty straightforward. Benedict's house was small, and 600 feet bigger is a lot. So Benedict's house takes up 600 x Benedict's area, which is roughly 64.7.\n\n**Note:** Be careful about using multiplication in square roots. If you use the multiplication sign over the square root, you\u2019ll find your answer to be off. For example: $$\\sqrt{64}\\ *\\ 34.7$$ means that square root of 64 is multiplied by 34.7.

So, we can take each color of the three green coryns and substitute with the numbers of each that are in that color.\nIn the third line, we cannot immediately take out three green coryns from the three green coryn. Because the question says that they are different, so we have to think of them as three different corynis one dark blue and one light blue and one somewhere between the two. So, we want eight of the two categories(i.e., light blue and dark blue), and one of the middle. After having three green and one other (which needs to be blue) we have to substitute the numbers in a correct manner to get the answer. Finally, we get that green has 5 of that color and blue has 8 of the two colors. We want three of one color and one of the other, so we have to take 4 green and 9 blue, respectively. So, the correct substitution needs to be this way: 4 green and 5 blue becomes 5 green and 9 blue respectively.\n\n### Input (with correction mark):Jenna's team is having 44 pizza's, 24 cookies and 14 sandwiches for a party with 20 guests.

Each flower has a seed and 60% of them are planted giving a total of 24 seeds. It's possible that the number of trees equals 24.\n\n### Answer is:   X = 24  \n  \n### Detailed walkthrough:\n1. James collects all the fruit... meaning that there are no fruit from which he cannot collect.\n2. Each tree has 2 flowers.  This is because the statement implies that each flower has a seed and each flower from each tree produces seeds. \n3. Each flower has a 0.6 seed, meaning that 60% of every plant's flower grows fruits.  This means that he plants the 0.6 of all the seeds which means there are 12 possible seeds to plant. \n4. There are 40 seeds if we add all the 12 from each plant.  There are 40 flowers.

{"text": "Gary is spending $1,200 ($6,000 divided by 5 years) more per month to pay the $6,00o loan off in 2 year instead of 5. Answer: $1,20,000/5\n\n### Instructions: The following question concerns the game of H.O.R.S.E, a variant of the traditional game of Poker. As with Poker, H.O.R,S.E. combines chance and skill, and involves multiple rounds of play, but there are some interesting twists of this game. In addition to the standard Poker hand values (9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A, K, Q, J, 10, and a wild card), Poker has a Joker. To play H.O.RSE, the first person in the game is forced to make best five card Poker hand possible from seven cards dealt in an unspecified order. The Joker can replace any card in the five card Poker hand. The player's five card Poker hand is compared to that of the others participants for the game. Any winner at that session of H.O.P.E. earns a pot of money. The next player is dealt the remaining six (instead of the first seven) cards, and must also make the best five card Poker hands possible, but must also include one card from the hand of the first player. The Joker can now replace any one card in the first player's five card hand. Now, the first loser in each round of H.O. R.S.E. pays a pot of money to the winner of each hand. How much money to they pay for losing round? How many rounds does it take for each player to pay the same amount of money that he originally earned?\n\n### Demostration:\nTo begin, the question describes a game of H.ORE.S.E., which is similar to Poker except it includes one additional card (the Joker). H.O R.S. E requires each player to create his best possible 5 card Poker hand from the 7 cards dealt to him. Then, he must include the card from the hand of those who lost round one in the initial", "answer": " 150"}

{"text": "**Solution:**\nTo begin with, there is no explicit information on the scale of each model train, so let's base our reasoning on the idea that the scale is roughly similar for all year models, or in other words, they are \"1:1\", meaning the real-world scale is 1:1. We can use this to calculate the scale of the number of gifts, which would be approximately \"2\" gifts per year, which could also be applied to the initial number of trains if it is scaled to \"1\".\n\nHowever, this would be inconsistent when applying this to the number of gifts received in the second year, as the scale would be \"2\", which would be equal to \"1\".  We need to account for this discrepancy in logic between each year.\n\nTo ensure that the logic is consistent, we can scale it to \"2\" or \"half\" per year for the sake of easy calculating and applying it to each year, using a simple formula of scaling.\n\nFor example, we know how many trains he has at the end of each year, so we can use that to count the number of trains received each year, using the following logic:\n\n**Year 1**:  \nHe started off asking for 1 train for his birthday and double that for his Christmas. If we assume he was asked for 5 trains at the end of each respective holiday, that would give us \"7\" total, which when scaled to \"2\" gives us \"3\" trains.  Therefore, he originally had \"3\" trains.\n\n**Year 2**:  \nFor his birthday, he was asked for 2 trains, and for Christmas, he got \"4\", so \"6\" for the year, which when scaled is \"3\" again. Which he already had, so he now has \"6\" in total.\n\n**Years 3**, **4** and **5**:  \nFor each respective year, he is always asked for \"1\" train, which when scaled, we get \"2\". So for each year it would be \"3\", \"4\" and \"5\" respectively, which, when combined with the \"6\" he already has, gives a total of \"15\" by the end of the 3 consecutive years, which gives us 5 years, as requested.\n\nTherefore", "answer": " 45"}

The bakery can make a maximum of 12 pies in an hour. However, each pie contains 3 pieces. This suggests that 12 pies would equal 36 pieces.\n\n#### Decide the pie cost\n\nNext, we need to determine the price of a pie, which is 4 dollars for one piece.\n\n#### Calculate the bakery's cost\n\nTherefore, we can calculate the total bakery cost in this instance as $36, but it's important to remember that this only accounts for the pies sold, not the pies that can't be sold.\n\n#### Determine the bakery'e revenue\n\nNext, we'll look at the bakery'S revenue. Because all of the pies could be sold, and each pie takes 1 hour to make. We multiply the number of sold pies (36) by the time it takes them to make each piece.\n\n#### Detect if there is any margin for the profit\n\nFinally, we'll consider the bakery' S profit. In this instance, the profit would be $16.40 ($7.60). This amount is calculated by deducting the total bakery'S cost from the total bakery revenue.\n\nWe hope that the response is satisfactory.

{"text": "Given that Jimmy has 7 hours to sell pizzas, he makes 70 pizzas to sell the flour.\nInput: The question is asking how many pizzas Jimmy will make. The statement 'at the end of 7 hours, some flour was left' tells us that Jimmy is selling 70 pizzers, but there is no answer choice for that. The solution is to assume that the flour Jimmy has for the pizza recipe is 70kg and the pizzas he prepares consume 0.5kg, which results in 140 pizzas being prepared. Because he sold 70 of them, he had 70kg left, which is half the 140kg he could have had, which would have only provided enough for 70 pizzes.\nRationales: Given that Jimmy has 70kg of flour to sell his pizzas, each pizza needs 70/50, or 0.7 of a kg. He takes 10 minutes to make each pizza, so we're looking for 70 0.7's. Given this, each pizza will take about 7 minutes to finish, meaning for the 70 pizzs we want to sell, he spends a total of 490 minutes preparing them all. We know that Jimmy has 7 hour to sell his pizz, but that doesn't matter, since we already know he's selling 70 0f them.\nAnswer: He sells 70 pizzles, since that's what he's given time to sell.\n\n### Input The statement \"I can't drive for miles\", means:\n\n### Demostration: the person cannot drive for the designated times, which is 4 milies. \n\n### Rationales: The question has given a specific definition when the expression was used.

That is, she is given 20 roses to purchase and a ratio of an additional 3/4 times more lilies.\n3. However, to keep things simple, we know that there is also a requirement that the lilies cost 2 times as much as the roses.\n4. Therefore, if a rose costs $5, and a lily costs $10, we will begin with this knowledge.\n5. From here on we will calculate the flower price and the number of flowers so that we can estimate the total amount of money spent on the flowers.\n6. First, we can find the ratio of how many roses to how many lilies.\n7. If 20 roses were bought, then we can multiply that amount by the ratio to find how many lilies were bought.\n8. That is, 20 roses * 3/4 lilies = 15 lilies.\n9. So, after this is determined, we can find the total price of the purchased lilies.\n10. If a lily costs $20, and there are 15 lilys being purchased for $20 x 15 that comes out to $300.\n11. This means we have our answer for question 13.

The instructions state that the word that begins with 'o' ends with 'v'.\n2. The blank sentence template states 'There is a lot __ I need, but it is more important there is also __', where two blanks are to be filled in.\n3. The word 'wants' suggests that there is certainty of some sort of desirable outcome, such as what one wants to achieve, thus suggesting the presence of something that one wants.\n4. The word 'deserve' is used in tandem with 'there is a lot' and so can be inferred as having the implication that the given object/sentence/thing is something that one does deserve to have, further suggesting that the word 'wants' provides a hint as to what it means.\n5. The blank sentence template begins with 'There is a lot of ___ I want', where the word before 'of' is filled in to state the thing that was stated earlier in the instructions.", "answer": " 66"}

The question does not ask for how many individual pages were finished reading. In order to simplify the addition, it's easier and more intuitive to work in a table and list each persons total reading so far and their total pages to read. Then, we multiply each persons remaining pages by their reading speed to calculate how long each would take based on their individual reading speed. Once that's done, we simply add those times to get the combined total of how long they've been reading overall.\n\n### Output Instructions:\nEach of these three questions is asking to find how many pages they have left to read.\n\n### Analysis Instructions:\nThis question uses the concept of how many books each individual has left to read. They each have an individual reading rate so we can see how long each will likely take to finish each book. We use the math formulas as follows:\n\nRene reads pages=R, pages per minute (ppm)=1/p\n\nLulu reads pages=l, ppm=1/l\n\nCherry reads pages=c, ppm=12/12\n\nNow, we list each of their remaining pages, divide it by their individual pmm, then multiply it by their total time in minutes and they we get their times of how long they will read that many remaining pages.\n\nRene - 30 pages = 30 pages/pmr = 30 pages * 0.5 minutes", "answer": " 328"}

{"text": "John has 18 left after giving away 20 of what's left, so 12. \n\nInput:John has 18 light bulbs left, so he gives half of what he has. Then, how many does he have left at the end of the day?\n\nInput:John uses 7 and 120 light bulbs and then gives them one at a time, in no particular order, until there is only one left.  What number is it?\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Solution:The trick to this kind of question is to note that each choice is only able to include a number that's less than or equal to the total amount that has been given away.\n\nIn this case, the total amount of light bulbs are 134.  We can then eliminate choices A and B because their individual items have a lower numerical value, making their total smaller. In option C, since the light bulbs have been given away, the total they're giving cannot exceed the total given away already.  We can therefore eliminate option D because their sum has exceeded the amount of light bulbs left, indicating the last light bulb is, in reality, choice E.\n\n#### Detailed analysis:The answer choices can be split into a minimum, maximum and sum between.  The minimum number that each choice can have is 1, which means choice A cannot be that because we're told the number of light bulbs, not the minimum value.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining choice C: 134, would be the maximum number as this is the highest amount of bulbs used. As seen from the diagram, choices A, B, D, only go up to 100. \n\nIn summary, what remains are: 1. Choice A, which has been eliminated because it has a lower numerical value than we're being given to choose from and 2. Choice D, which has been eliminates because it has a numerical value exceeding what is available. \n\nWhat is left is Choice C and E which sum up at 206 altogether. The sum between can be considered one number greater than the sum of the minimum, which means that C and E's sum of 206 is the maximum option and therefore Choice E is the correct answer. \n\nAnswer: E: 2", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "The total cost of the lawnmowers last year was ($1800 = 10/12 * 2000) = $10/12*1800 =1500/12 = $125. If Mr. Lucian has enough money to buy each of these four lawnmowers, he may spend 4*125 = $500.\nBut, Mr. Lucian doesn\u2019t have the full amount to buy each lawn mower. He has enough money to buy half of a lawnmower = $500/2 = $250. Therefore, he may spend a total of $1000. But that is for buying the lawnmower, leaving him enough money to buy some other item as he likes. But, then, the total money that he spent on his lawnmowers will cost him some $350.\nRationales: The questions statement asks to calculate how much it would for Mr. Lucian to purchase 4 lawnmowers if the price of lawnmowers was $180 1 year ago.\nThere are 3 parts to this question:\n1. Find the cost of one lawnmower in 1 year ago by finding how much $1800 equals $10/13 since this is 1 year ago. We use the following rule to divide $1800 into 10/13: divide the larger, $1800, by the larger of the two smaller numbers, then keep the remainder to the smaller number.\n2. Use the same formula to find the total cost, $10/14. This is $1800 \u00f7 10/14\n3. Now, using the formula for number of lawnmowwers, $1000/$ price = n, divide the total, 1800 by the cost, $100/10 to get the answer: 4.\n4. Find half the cost: half of 100/13 = $8.\nSo, the total we\u2019ll spend on lawnmowers is $100/2 = 50, plus the cost of half a lawnmower (=8), for a total of $5", "answer": " 10080"}

{"text": "9\n\n### Rationale: The three people, Maggie, Kelsey, and Layla, picked and averaged 30 of the apples, so Maggie picked 40, Kelsey picked 30, and Layla picked 5.  To find out how many apples Layla picked, it's necessary to solve for her numerator, the amount of apples she picked, from her whole number ratio.\n### Explanation: First, calculate the three whole number ratios:  Layla's, Maggie's, and Kelsey's.\n\n    Layla: 1 \u2215 (5 + 28 + 40) = 1 \u2236 54\n\n    Maggie: 1 \u27f9 30 + 30\n\n    Kelsey: 1 \u267e 30\n\n### To solve Layla's numerator, the numerator, it's necessary the divide 54 by its denominator, or add the divisors.\n\n   54 \u2236 (1 \u267e  30) = 54 \u220a 1 \u2671  11\n\nThen, to determine Layla's fraction, it's necessary that Layla's denominator is the common denominator shared between Maggie and Kelsey. This is because their numerators are different, so only sharing a denominator will allow for both fractions to cancel out. \n\n   54\u220a(1 \u2671 11) = 54\u220a (11 / 30) = 40/11\n\nThen it's necessary to perform the arithmetic operation on the fractions to arrive at the final answer.\n\n   9/11 = 40/30 = 9/30\n\nHence the answer to, how many apples did Layla pick, is 9.\n\n### Input:\"Sarah and Emma each had two cakes for a dessert.

Make sure the answer is in terms of integers, the signs should reflect what the question is asking, and there should be a variable.\n\n* Integers: If Salvadore earned  1956$, then he earned 1956 / 100, so his earnings are  19.56 units, or 19$ and 56 cents. If Santo earned  978$, then his earnings are 978 / 100 which should equal  9.78 units,  9$ and 78 cents.\n* When the question states \"What is the sum of the two men's earnings together\" the natural response would be \"Sum Salvadore + Sum Santo\", and if we're going to do math, we should be doing math the way it makes sense to us, not how the test wants us to do math. Also, I see this question in word form and it's just \"$29.34$\"\n\n#### Step 4:\nAs it stands at this point, it should already be clear to us that the answer is $48$ dollars. There are three reasons why:1.

{"text": "The answer is C: 16 pages.\n\n### Rationale: The best book, based on its page count, should be considered. As the question says Yasna has two books, the two books must be distinct.\n\n### The first step is to find out how long Yasna needs to read the second book in days. Assume we are referring to the first book because the question implies she has two books.\nLet\u2019s see how we can find out what percentage of the pages the first book takes to be finished in two weeks.\nWe can find out first book pages in two weeks like this: (2 weeks)*(30 pages in a day / 24 hours in a day) = 360 pages\nSo the first book takes 360 days to fulfill.\n\nSo now, we know how long this book takes to fulfill and we now know what we need to do with it.\n\nSo, we have to subtract total pages from total days. Therefore, this total pages = (360-380)/2 which is 360-360=0. Or we can say 360-280=80.\n\nSo if we subtract 80 pages from 360, we will get total pages remaining.\n\nSo, 360-80=360. So we need to read 360 pages.\n\nNow, Let\u2019s solve for the second book.\n\nSo now we know how long it would take for the first book to be done and we have a second book of 180 pages. So we need to find out how many pages one can read per day in two weeks for both of the books.\n\nWe could say: 2 weeks * (30 pages in a page / 24 hours) = (380-180) pages.\n\nSo we can solve: 380-160=380 pages.\n\nSo to solve the second book we need to get 380 pages again.\nAs we said we read 360- 80 = 360 total pages of the first book in 2 weeks. So if we read 30/24 pages per day for the first book we can still read a combined total of 360/30", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": "James pays $300 for the steaks.\n\n### Rationale:  First, we need to figure out how to get the dollar amount he paid.  Since, buy one get one free, he only paid for 1 purchase, and we know how many pounds he bought, so it can be said that: $300 = 20 pounds (purchased) * cost per pound. If we substitute one, in place of zero, in the expression above, it can be said: $300 - 300/2 = 20 * $15\n###  Thus, he paid $300 for 20 pounds of steak.\n\n### Input- The sun is setting. \n### Response: The sun is sinking.\n### Rationale- The verb phrase 'to set' means 'to start to sink'.  The actual sinking of the sun might be implied as it has not stopped yet.  You could say, \"The Sun is descending\" or \"The sun is dipping\".\n\n### Input - \"Dave used his credit card for his recent purchase.\"\n### Response- \"Dave paid for the purchase using his credit card.\"\n### Rationale - \"Uses\" is a transitive verb meaning that it requires an object.   Given this, you need to find out if there is actually an object or some sort of receiver associated with the action.  In the case of this sentence.  Dave is the one doing the action of 'using' or 'paying with' their credit card.

The sentence is indicating that there is an object to go with \"pay the bill\" since both parties have to do it.

So, her revenue = $2 * 5\n- This is the amount she should have recieved if she had sold at $2\n- But she did not, hence the change in cash will be amount she recieves - amount she should have recieve.\n- So, change in cash = $172.55 because she changes her profit from $172.15 (amount she had previously) to -23.2 (amount she should have recieved, but didn't), giving a net of $172.32 (change in cash) after selling the last batch of water btols at reduced price", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "Answer:\n> Alyssa and Abbey only need to collect 37 cans, as it totals 77 cans in all.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Alyssa collected a total of 30 cans, and Abbey collected a total of 43 cans.\n2. If 100 cans are needed to complete the project and 77 cans have already been collected, then only 23 more cans remain.\n3. As Alyssa has collected 30 cans + 77 remaining cans = 107 cans, she needs an additional 23 cans.\n4. Similarly, Abbey has collected 43 cans + 75 remaining cans = 94 cans, she needs 16 more cans.\n5. Thus, altogether need 43+23=66 and only need 7 more each to achieve the target of 100 canns.\n6. In this way, we solve it, they only need to collect 23 more for Alysse, and 26 more for Abbey.\nAnswer: 43 for Alyssa and 26 for Abbey\n\n### Input::Alyssa and Aaron are in high school.

Let's consider the diagram below:\n\n![](images/exercises/coding/gd.gif)\n\nThe slice that was cut in half will have only 20 slices.\n\n4. Now, we will find the number of sliced that will be on the slice Jelly picks which is: \\(\\frac{40}{2}\\)(since 40 is the number of slices evenly spread and 2 is the amount of halves made so we will divide it by that number).\n5. Then, we will multiply it by 2/3 because 2/3 is multiplier of Jelly's pick so it will divide it by half resulting in \\(\\frac{40}{3}\\)(since there is only 3 halves on the piece Jelly took so we will multiply it by \\(2/3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 2, which is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\times {2/2}\\)) which after division would be \\(\\frac{2}{2}\\), which is equal to 1 when we multiply it by 2 resulting in 2/3).\n6.

The answer is 36 cups of lemonades.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe drink contains 1/4 of the cup, that cup contains one and 1/4 cups, so there are 18 cups in total. Since Abigail wants to keep each cup equal to the other, so we know that the number of lemonade cups would be 4 times, 18.

From 1, we understand the distance of 1,000 feet of Veronica's flashlit and 3,000 feet for Freddie.\n3. Given Velma's flashlit will be less than three times farther than Veronicam's and Freddie, Velma's distance of visibility can be calculated using the same formula: Velma's distance would be 2,000 feet less (X) than 3,00x, X would be 1,00x. We also know the formula to calculate 1,00X.\n4. Substituting the values, we get X = (10 - 3)(3,000) = 2,003,000 and we know the formula for that as well by just substituting the X value, we get 2,00,000ft, therefore answer is 100,00ft.", "answer": " 12,000"}

The sentence initially stated, that John Didn't use the dictionary, then states that he just made up everything.\n2. The statement \" made up everything\" refers to how John used whatever he wanted to use for the project and did not use the dictionary.\n3. Therefore, \"Just\" is not a suitable grammatical word for this sentence as it is the opposite of \" did not use the dictionary\". It makes no sense to use \" made up everything\" and just to complete the sentence.\n4. As a result, the correct answer is \"No one knows what it actually says\" because it is the only one out of the 5 options that fills the blank in the sentence in the appropriate way.\n5.

Now, each time he recharges for $3.5 and Hawkeye is driving to Aunt's place so each time he reaches an amount of say $20.\n3. Since he goes through the same number of charges, we assume Hawkeye started his drive with a $20 charge in his battery, spent $20 for recharging from that point, and repeated the same process 4 times.\n4.

{"text": "$2.80\n\n### Rationale:\nAt first glance that looks like the correct answer, but a second closer look shows that's incorrect. If the bags were marked down and sold for $4 at the end and she sold 15 baskets of granola, that would have made a total of $60 in profit! So 15 basked x $4 = $60 and each basket contained 20 bags.\n\n### Net Profit:\nShe used $3.00 dollars worth of ingredients per bag and each bag contained 20 baked. So that means at the beginning the cost per bag was $1.50. If you subtract $1.50 x 15, you get -$22.50 in losses from the $22.50 x 5 net profit and that is -$112.50 in total profit because the ending profit is net profit minus beginning loss.\n\n### Total profit at the beginning would have been -$22.00 + $440 - $112.5 and that would have been \n$417.50 in total profits.\n\n### If it wasn't for the last 5 bags being sold at $4.00, there would have been $22.5 less in losses at the end.

There are 4 x 20 =120 students in the fourth grade. each student receives a hamburgers with a 2.20 hamburger and 4 x 21 = 28 students in the fifth grade. each student receives hamburger with a hamburger. There is 0.50 for each carrot and a cookie. \n2. For example, in the third grade, we take 100. 100 x 2.10 = 210.00 and we subtract 1.50. So, it will be 208.50.

The context of what Melanie needs to do is to place bread pieces into the blending machine.  She will tear the bread into halves first and then into small pieces, so there will be two bread pieces cut in half.  Next, she will tear the halves into small pieces that are three times smaller than the previous set.  For example, if a bread piece that is half the size of the original bread piece, then when she tears it again, she now has three pieces all the same size that are three times smaller.\n\n### Feedback:\nYou answered correctly.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nYou understood that the recipe calls for bread pieces and that to make the pieces, Melanie has to tear them into small pieces with the blending machine.

Because 2400 x 160 = 40800, when 160 x 40 is 64000 which is greater.

We can identify a formula for how many he has in stock, but need to find the value for what's missing. This value is the total number of fish he originally had, and we can use our information to establish this:\n3. Our equation is 50 + (number of fish spoiled)/(number of fish still in stock) = 85, but we know that the spoiled fish total 150. So, we want to plug a different number in for the spoiled number in order to derive the original total.\n4. Subtracting 150 from both sides leaves us with (number of fish he has in stock) = 35/2 and then subtracting this from both sides leaves us again with (number of fish in stock) = 17.\n\n### Input : Sally makes her living designing websites for the public.

Then how many gallons of pain does she need \n\n### Rationales:Each of the answer choices is different in terms of the paint ratio.\n\n1. The first option E: 4 gallons is incorrect as a single, square gallon of paint covers only 800 square feet (842 square sq. in.) which means 4 gallons would not be needed to cover a wall that is 600 square sq. in.\n2. The second option C:1.708 gallons is incorrect because a square gallon of paint is 2590 square cm, and 600 square meters divided by 2590 is 2.29, which makes C: 1.708 not needed. \n3.The third option D:2.2050 gallons is also incorrect because according to the previous answer, 15-gallons of paint cover 900 sq. ft. However, a square foot divided by a square gallon (not 15 gallons) makes the answer 5.8 which would imply a wall with a square footage that is a multiple of five. Since Henrietta's wall is of 600 sq, the third option is incorrect.\n4. The fourth option B:1.3925 gallons is also incorrect and makes the same assumptions as the third option C which is that a 1.5 gal. would cover a wall with an sq. footage that is a multipe of five. \n5. The final answer is option A: 1.2045 gallons as it's the only option that correctly solves the problem. \nRationales:The question states that 600 sq feet take up one gallon of paint, and three bedrooms each take around 400 sq. feet of wall to paint, and that one gallon of paint covers 800 feet of wall area.\n1.

After _______ days, there were ______.\n\n### Demostration:\nAfter 10 days, Mr. Williams bought 12 gallons of juice. \nThus, Mr. Williams bought _______ cups of juice. 10 gallons are equivalent to _______ cups. After _______ cups were drunk, 10 were left. \nSo, there were _______ cups drunk.\n\nRationales:\n1.The question asks for the number of cups the guests drank while attending the party. We have to first find the number of cups that were initially in the party(the answer given in the question is 10), then the number of cups which was drunk after the party(answer option B). Let us consider the number of cups used at the party as the total number of cups N.\n2. As the question states that each gallon has 12 cups, we first find the number of gallons used in a party by dividing the total number of cupsi.e.N.\n3. Now, 10 gallons(12 cups per gallon) are equivalent to 120 cups(10 gallons), hence the number of cups in the party is 120.\n4. We subtract the number of cups left after the party from the total number of cuphence there would be no cups left.\n5. We divide the answer by the total number of cuphi.e. N, to obtain the number of cups drunk.

{"text": "24 yards\n\nInput: The 66-yard field goal wasn't much harder on account of the wind because it was kicked in which direction? Choices: 1. A: across B: directly against 2. C: directly to the side 3. D: perpendicularly to the wind 4. E: straight into the wind\nRationales:  1. The field of the football field and especially a field goal is known to be 100 yards long. This is because the field goal is only kicked on the 3rd down, where the kicker has 40 yards to do so. Otherwise, it's considered a first down.\n2. The 66- yard field goal is described to be 'harder' on account of the wind, so that means that the kick was not so simple, but the wind was a factor in difficult that the kick was in the first place.\n3. Let's break down each of the answer choices and make a note of what each one implies:\n    1. \n        * A:  This one means \"against\". With the wind blowing against the kicker, it is harder to kick it as there needs to be sufficient force behind the shot to make the ball go in. There is a possibility the wind could push the ball in instead.\n        * B:  This implies towards which way the wind was blowing, indicating away from which it was easier to kick as the ball would be pushed towards the target. However, 'across' does not directly imply the direction the wind was blowing.\n    2. \n        * C: \"To the side\" means away from kicking direction to the left or right. In this scenario, it implies that the wind was not blowing directly against the kicker's direction, but it was blowing towards which is why it is easier. However, this would mean that the field goal was not very 'hard' on the wind, nor challenging, but it was easier.\n        * D: This means 'directly into the wind'. That said, when the wind is blowing towards the kicker, the ball will move in the opposite direction, which means that the ball will go away from the target, not towards it, which implies that it is a challenge to kick the ball into the wind. This is not described in the question as it states the field", "answer": " 24"}

It also states that Rachel\u2019s age is 2 years more than 4 times her current age. It then adds that Rachel is 2 years more short than her age.

Let's calculate the cost of the trip using a diagram, starting with the $50 raised and adding all the $5 contributed:\n![](images/diagrams/Field-trip-cost-Diagram.png)\n\nNext, we subtract this from the total cost of the trip: $7*20. Here's the calculation:\n![](images/-images/Math/Field-trip/Diagram-for-miss-Grayson.png)\n\nTherefore, the number left above allotted for each student's expenses is $7 - $12 = $5. Adding this to the $50 raised, we see that there is a deficit of $40.\n\nIt is clear that these calculations suggest that the total cost of the field trip was $140 ($7*20), which is higher than the final calculation of $100 of donations and contributions. Apart from this, each student spent $7 on the field trip, with $5 being raised by each. If all the students paid $7 each, the funds left above would be $20 ($100- ($70*20)). $60 was left above, but that's only $5 more.\n\nConcluding, the correct answer choice is B: $60.\n\n### Input:{ \"first_name\": \"Stephen\", \"last_name\": \"King\" },{ \"first_name\":...\n\n### Rational: There are a total of 20 students in the class (listed as objects { \"name\":... }) whose scores are stored in another list \"scores\".

The party requires each person to have a 6 ounce cup of tea. According to the ratio and knowing the number of people at the party, that's 12 cups. We can see that each cup should contain approximately equivalent amounts of tea.\n* Artemis knows that her mom drinks an entire 8 oz cup(full) of tea for every 1 ounse of tea she uses. Her mom has 320 oz of tea. Artemis knows that she uses the same 8 oz to1 ounce ratio she is using for her mom. She needs 40 ounces for each 8 oz cup.\n* Artemiss will use the same amount of tea she used for her mom(320 ounces) at the party. The 40 ounses of tea she'll use for the party are 40/320 divided is 1 cup of tea.\n* We know that each cup of tea for 12 people is 6 ounces (12/8).

{"text": "146 bananas\n### Demonstation :\nWe'll start by identifying how many there are bananas overall. There are 10 piles with an average of 9 hands, that each hand has 14 bananas. We can also say that 12-monkey family collected 120 bananas altogether.\nWe'll then calculate how we divide the bananas equally.\nLet's say we have 3 hands with 14 bananas = 42 bananas\nLet's say there are 6 hands with 9 bananas = 54 bananas\n\nAfter we identify what each hand has, we'll sum up the overall amount of bananas being 104 bananas. Now, we know that 104 banana is equal to 5.4 handfuls of bananas, because 104 divided by 54 = 5 hands with 9 banana, and 54 divided by 14=4 hands with 14.\nThe family of 12-monkeys will have 74 bananas to split, and for it to be equal, each monkey will then get 10.5 bananas. Each monkey will have 10.5 handfuls of banana, and if the family of 12 had 104 banananas overall, they now have 10.3 bananas each.\nSo, each monkey will get 10.35 bananas because 104 banans / 10.3 = 46 / 2 = 23 / 2 = 11.5, which equals to 10.366 = 10.3\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct response is '10.3 banana'.", "answer": " 99"}

{"text": "It's been observed that the question has stated that a 20 percent down payment is mandatory which means that Tara must pay the lump sum of 20 percent of the total cost of the laptop ($200). However, the question asks about the payment for four months instead of Tara making the lump sum immediately.\n\nAssume that Tara is making the down payment in monthly installments.\nTo find the payment balance, all we need to do is to subtract the down payment from the total cost. As the down payment is equal to 20 percent of $1000 which is $200 then to be subtracted from $1000 we will need to multiple Tara's payments (monthly installments) by four and then subtract the payment of the down payment to obtain the balance in her payment account.\n\nLet's first of all identify what each of the given values means. Tara spends 65$ per month in installments. That means, Tara's payment will sum up to (65*4) which is $260.

{"text": "This property is $218,400.\n\nThe question states that the price for the home is $98/sq ft, and that the home is 2,420 sq ft.\n\nThe given answer represents the total area of home (2,420) and barn (1,000) combined.\n\nThe given price per home space ($98) is divided into home area (2,4240), and the price given to the barn ($98) is multiplied by the barn area (100). Since we have 2 prices, and 3 dimensions we need to solve for one value, and the value that we can solve for is the total price for the property.\n\nWe subtract the home price from the property price, and divide that value by the dimension of the home (2,400/98 = 24.36) then multiply by the square footage of the barn (792), the result is equal to $218,320, which is rounded to the nearest dollar.\n\n### Rationale\n\nWe are given 3 variables, $98, 2,424, and 792. The formula to solve for any given variable is to use this equation: (known variable)(known variable)(variable) = known variable. Our example states that we need to find the price of this property, which is $2,524,000,000.\n\nTo find the price, we take the price given to the home space, subtract that from the price given to the property, then we divide that value by the dimensions of the home space. Since we are given $2,52,4, and sq footage, we use the equation: (98)(2,424)(7) = 24,36(792) = 2,524. We multiply this value by the given price of the home space.\n\nAnswer: $218,210.00", "answer": " 333200"}

{"text": "```\n18 - (8/2).\n```\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following question:\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: When I left home I ran right in to an old friend what? Choices:\n\n1. A: he bumped into B: ran into\n\n2. he met C: had run into D: ran up on E: had run into\n\nRationales:\n\n1.  The first letter of each option can be seen, so they can be easily eliminated, and we can easily get down to the last 4.\n\n2. It should be bumped into since the wording in the question suggests that it would be accidental, i.e. not meant to happen. \n\n3. Option A is a sentence fragment since \u2018I ran right\u2019 could also be one of the options, in which case this needs to be rewritten as, \u2018When I ran right in to\u2019. In option B, \u2018I\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem to work with \u2018ran up\u2019, in addition, the phrasing \u2018What I ran right in\u2019 might be confusing from which one could have got the answer, so this is ruled out. Again, \u2018he bumped right in\u2019 is incoherent.\n\n4. Option D is inappropriate since, what is meant to be, is that we ran into the person accidentally, and even more so that we ran into him. Moreover, we don\u2019t run into a person, we meet one.\n\n5. Option E is not the answer because it uses the word \u2018had run into\u2018 but it does not say I ran into him. It just means he ran into me, which doesn\u2019t give us the appropriate answer. \n\n6. We are left with option A and option C, which are both gramatically correct.\n\n7. Finally, since the options are grammatically correct, all that we can do is determine who had the best score in our grammar test. Thus to determine this, let\u2019s look at the question again, \u2018 When I left home I met an old friend\u2019.  From the sentence, we can see that the friend was already there when I left home. This is why it is met; not ran into. Then comes the phrase \u2018right away\u2019, which could be replaced with \u2018right in\u2019. In other words", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "Input: A family has three adults (a total of 3 adults), three girls (+-3 in total) (a total of 6 girls), and three boys (+-6) (a total of nine people in total). They prepared 3 dozen boil eggs for the trip, which means they have 36 eggs (3 dozen= 12 eggs or (6*2) eggs). Therefore, each adult was given three eggs, hence 9 eggs per three adults and each boy was given one more egg than each girl because the girls get snacks with them which mean they had a total of 10 eggs in total. Now as the girls received 1/4 of the total eggs, that gives us 7 eggs per 1 girl (since 1/4 of 36 = 7.1/4=.35). Therefore in order to get 7 eggs per one girl, we will get 35 eggs. Since there are two boys and three girls, the children are going to get 26 eggs each (36-3 adults\u20193 eggs and +-10 boys), which sum up to be 90 eggs. Hence total number of eggs = 90 + 36, = 126 eggs. Now given this number of eggs, we can calculate that the number of families = (total number of eggs/3dozen). However in the question above, each boy was given an extra egg hence 36 becomes 37 for boys. So based on this knowledge and the numbers given above, we will get 14 families on the trip.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nTo begin with, it is important to note that the number of eggs provided per person may vary depending on the number of adults, girls, and boys. \n\nIn the question, it is stated that each adult was given three (3) eggs, and each boy was given an additional egg, compared to each girl, indicating that the girls were served fewer eggs than the boys, implying that each egg is equal to 1/4 of a dozen, according to the question statement.\n\nTherefore, the sum of eggs given to boys and girls as stated by the question statement would be: 7(boys) + 9(girls) + 1 (boys per girl)  =  26(boys) +1 (boys per girls)", "answer": " 10"}

Choices: A) $10.00 C) $20.00 B) $12.00 D) $13.00 E) $9.00\nRationales:1. We see two reasons from that image which indicate the product is currently not for sale.  First there's a red circle which suggests that the item may not be up for sale.  Second, a white slash through a word could mean to indicate that the item costs a different price. \n2. The slashed out word, in this case, is'sold', but since slashed through is often used to indicate that the price is lower now than it was at the standard price, that's a good sign that the price of the item could be on sale, and maybe a price drop would be announced shortly.  3. We then notice that the red circle was removed, and the new, slashed through, price of C$15 suggests that we should use the slashed through rate, not the base rate, and that leads us to try the slashed through discount rate, at C$15.\n4.

After traveling 2 miles for every 100 miles at a 100 miles an hour, you travel a total of 0.04 miles per hour at an average speed.

{"text": "E: 1 can of paint\nIf each can of paint covers two square meters, then Lucille needs 5 cans of paint as the total height and width of the three walls will make up 52 meters. 42 of those meters are covered in two different sized cans - the final wall is only 4 meters high and its width is exactly two meters longer than the walls on either side.\n\n### Response Review\n#### Explanation:\nWe need to know how many cans of the same size (in this case 1 square meter) will cover 2 meters.

Choices A: calculate something B: buy something C: think something D: create something E: do something\nRationale 1. Going to need means the person has to think to calculate and do something and not just think something.\n2. We don't know the meaning of aunt. In context it could be used for grandparent or a relative but it is more likely that aunt refers to a female parent's brother's or sister's wife whose first name is also \"aunt\", or an aunt who is a relative from the same parents.\n3. Since the sentence talks about a situation where a person has to figure out about twice, it means that the person needs to create more. Since the person is creating something, it doesn't mean the creation has to be art, as art is not necessary for the context (the sentence says calculating, thinking, and doing). (D) creates something is the correct answer. Since the person has to calculate something it doesn't mean that the calculation has to be mathematical because it may be another sort of calculation related to the situation, and that too may not involve any mathematical formulae. (C) Thinking about twice means a person needs to think more\n4. (E) Do something does not fit because the sentence says, \"You are going to need\" as opposed to \"should need\". \n5.

How many more workers can they afford to hire with the same budget?\n\n### Demostration:\nThere is 12 workers hired for $10 per hour. The company can't afford to hire more than 12. So there is 12 workers. Then the company can afford to hire 2 workers. In total there is 14 workers.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe first step is for the company to find out how much money they have to pay. This step is important because without it, we can\u2019t calculate the cost it takes to pay the workers. Based on the instruction, we know that the company wants to pay 12 workers for $10 per worker. This results to a $120 payment to the workers.\nWe will use the formula of $120+$120($2 per each worker), to get the total payments.\n\nWe know that for 12 workers the budget per worker is $12. Based on the budget per worker, we can say that the company can pay twice more workers than the budget per worker.\n\n$120+$180= $300\n\nThis sums up the total cost to pay the workers.\n\nBased on this amount we know that they can afford to pay 12 worker with 2 times more workers, or 24.

If we take a closer look at the answers with numbers, C = 33.2, D = 72.7, E = 103, and F = 500.\n\n### Riddles\n\nWe'll make use of these letters to try to find a solution to our riddle.\n\nFirst, we can try E = 101 using numbers and get **103** which we know is incorrect. From this, we know that the correct number is either 500 (F) or it is some number more than 33 (D). However, 727 is more than 103, but it is less that 333. Hence, D = 787 is NOT the correct answer.\n\nLet's take a look at the solution: F= 500\n\n| Choice | Letters used       |\n| ------ | ------------------ |\n| A =  1 | Y, N, L, S, T, O, P, R, V |\n| B =  1 | O, P, Q, T, U, W, Y, Z |\n| C =  2 | I, Q, S, Y, Z | \n| D =  33 | A, B, D, J | \n| E =  500", "answer": " 20"}

The article was later removed and the author expressed their regret for the error in judgment that led to this situation and apologized.\n1. The context of the situation indicates that the author was criticized for publishing an article without obtaining the book author's permission.\n2. 'It was an error of judgment' is the most appropriate response to the situation as it implies that the author made a mistake in their judgment that led to the removal of the article.\n3. The context of the article suggests that the author regretted the error and was sorry for what happened.\n4. The author later expressed regret for their error in judgment and attempted to contact the book author and apologize.\n5. Therefore, option E: 'It was and error of judgment' is a fitting response to the situation.\nAnswer:\n\n### Answer: A: The story has a happy ending.\n\n### Input-Output:\n\nInput: It looks like the story has an unhappy ending.\n\nOutput: The story does, after all.\n\n### Example:\n\nIn a video, a man shows what appears to be a shady deal.

{"text": "6\n\n**Reasoning**:\n1. Since the bag (the container) in which the fruit had been placed had developed a hole, it had fallen out of the bag.\n2. The word \"and\" (line 4) between apple and plums specifies that both Granny Smith apples and pineapples were placed in the same bag.\n3. It is not specified when \"half\" of the fruit fell and out of what bag the fruit fell from. Hence, it is implied that half of the fruit fell outside the container.\n4. It is also implied that the fruit was placed in a single paper bags. \n5. There can be multiple bags but the statement says the fruit was placed in the same bag so plums were put in the same bag with pear and apple as they were all put in the same paper bag.\n6. Thus, Tanya bought 6 pieces of plum.\n\nAnswer Key:\n```\nStep 1: Rules\n```\nThis is a 'How many?' type question:\nWe need to find the number of remaining plums in the bag that Tanya bought.\n```\nStep 2: Planning\n```\nFrom the diagram, we can clearly see the number of pear and apple were 6, 4, and 2. They were placed in the same paper bag with other fruit and got out of the paper bag falling all around the road. However, number of plums bought were 7. We need to find out the number of plums got out of the bag to balance 6 pears, four Granny Smith apples (4), two pineapples (2), and only 6 plums in the bag.\n```\nStep3: Working\n6 plums were put in a single paper bagg so 12 pieces were in the bag. 7 plums were missing hence we can conclude that 5 plums were missing. Hence, the answer that fits into the description in the sentence is 5, (6+5=11 plums total)\n\n### Instructions: A restaurant had a choice of two kinds of coffee: one brand cost 50 dollars per gallon and another cost $114.50 per pound to purchase.

It doesn't directly answer the question: why did the man expect candy to come in a big package? He expected candy to come in big package because the package was transparent, see-through package.\n2. Only four options are plastic and none matches.\n3. The other answers include terms that clearly do not apply to the man's expectation.\n4. Thus, we can eliminate the other answers.\n5. To be clear, we can eliminate the answers: 'plum', which doesn't make sense, 'plastic', which is a plastic word. 'Greenish', which comes closest but only because it is the only non-plastic word that matches a transparent package.\n6.

{"text": "The answer is 114 hours.\n\n### Inputs:There are only two ways you can obtain a solution:\n1. Work Days\n2. Combined Time Off\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The total number of workdays in a year would be 200. The number of sick days in a year is 10.\n2. The number of days when Mark would be working in a year would be [(200\u2013 10) / 8] = 25\n3. The number of days worked could be obtained by adding (10 \u2013 5) / 8 = 3 days\n4. Therefore, there are 5 vacation days in a year.\n5. The number of vacation days when Mark would be not working in a year would again be (10 \u2013 25) / 8.  (10 \u2013 10) /8 = 1\n6. Now, if Mark had taken half of both, you would end up with [(15 + \u00bd) \u2013 (5 + \u00bd)] days which would result in 11 vacation days + 5 sick days which would end in 16 sick days [(16-10)/8] + 10 sick days [10/8]\n7.

{"text": "4x2/7\n\n### Demolition: \nThe first option is not an answer choice, but it is a relevant point that relates to the question: if the magnet cost three times more, then the items had to be of different prices. For example, if the price of the magnet was 12$ and the amount was three times more, the price could be 36$. \n\nThe second clue that is deduced from the answer choices is that Tish bought 4 objects: horseshoe magnet, stuffed animal, sticker, and item costing more than 4x2. This rule can be applied to both answers, as it provides more information that is not accounted for in the question. \n\nThe third clue is the price of the item purchased with the red horseshoe magnet. The sticker costs 1/4 the price of the horseshoe magnet, so the price of the horse's sticker should be $1.16. If $3 is the price of the horse magnet, the total cost of the horse should be $4. \n\nSince horse has a cost of $4 and is part of a group costing 4x2, the total cost of two animals equals four times $4, which is $16. Therefore, the horses cost $8 per animal.\n\nIf the question asked instead for the price of a stuffed animal, the answer should be 75$.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n### Instructions\nThis is a math question (so don't feel like you have to do any writing). \n\nAs part of a garage sale, four items were purchased by 12$ (a red horseshoe magnet), $14 (two stuffed animals), and $10 (a large sticker which read \"Why can't 2x3=10?\" \n\nThe question asks how much, in dollars per item, did a single stuff animal cost. \n\n### Demand\nTish purchased 4 items which include a horseshoe magnet worth $3 at 3x (since it cost three times more than $10). If the magnet cost $12, the stuffed toy must cost $8. \n\n## Examples\n\n```\nInstruction: Choose the item that does not describe the group.\n\nA", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "The average distance Terese runs is 3.66. Terese runs only six times throughout the week, so the average can simply be calculated by adding and dividing the total distance by the total number of times. In this case, since the total distance is 61.2 miles, we can divide the total distance by six. We have to be careful when dividing by a variable rather than adding it, so make sure the units all match up and all have the same units (this does not occur in all questions, but in this one, the units are equal).\n\n### Rationales:\n1. There are six running days. \n2. The daily running distances are listed in terms of miles. \n3. Terese runs a total of 61.2 (miles) throughout the week. \n4.

{"text": "You want to buy a $3 custard pie from the pie shop. The shop charges you $3 per slice and cuts whole pies into 10 slic...\nDetailed Solution:\n\nYou want to buy your $3 custard pie at the same pie shop, which charges you for a slice of pie at $3, regardless of whether you get a whole or half pie; thus cutting a single whole pie into 16 slices. The pie shop earns $60 for 6 pieces of whole pies. The question follows the idea of cutting the slice from the whole and, in order to solve, firstly, we have to find the number of slices in each pie. Assuming each pie has 10 equal slices, the shop sells six whole pies and earns $60. Thus, the answer is $30 per pie, since the shop only cuts pies after selling whole ones, and each whole pie is sliced into 16 pieces.\n\nAnswer: Eighty dollars\n\n### Input\n\nWhat country is home to the Loch Ness monster, and where is it located?\n\n### Demand\n\nBill is visiting Scotland and wants to learn everything he can about the Loch Ness Monster.

Such questions can be very easy and you lose marks if you don't follow the steps.\n\n### Sample Questions:\n\nInput: Everyone knows that the letter 'e' is the most frequently used letter in the English language. Is it true that the 'I,' which is the second letter of the most frequently used letter, is also the second most frequently used letter and the third letter of the most frequently occurring letter? Choices:\nA: Yes, it is true.\nB: No it is not true.\nC: That is too much information.\nD: The question is difficult to understand.\nRationales:\n1. It says that the first letter of the most frequent letter (English language) is the 'e' and the second letter of the same is the 'I'. We then assume that the most frequent letter in the word is also the first letter (the 'e' in the English Language)\n2. The question then asks whether it is true that the 'I' is the most frequent letter which itself is also the second most frequent letter. So, looking at the options to answer this, A is true, since the 'I,' which comes second in frequency, is also the second letter of the second most frequent letter and also the third letter of the first most frequent letter (letter in English Language) which is also the first letter of the second most frequently occurring letter. Choice B is clearly not true since the 'e' is neither the second most frequent letter nor the third letter of any of the most frequent letters.

Choices: 40:20 80:40 80:20 20:40 38:1\nRationales: In the first case, choose '20:40'. The question states that '38' is 38 more than '12'. This means that 38 is 26 more than 12, and the question is asking which option is 26 more. The answer is '20:46'.\nRationales for Second Case: In the second case, choose '38:10'. The question states '12' is half of '38'. This means that '38' should be '76', and '12' should be '18'. This is because we subtract '12' to get '74' and we divide it by '2'. The result should be the same as '18': '18:3'.\nRationales For Third Case: In the third case, choose '56:26'. This is because the question provides us with the difference between '38' and '12' = 36. In order to simplify, we should add '12': 48, which means that '14' is the third term. The expression becomes '46:14', so the quotient is 33. Now, '12' is one-third of '38' and it's divisible by three. The new quotient is 3/33:5 (third 3), which is divisible by three.

{"text": "If each of Jose's bottles of wine is the same size, then each bottle contains approximately the same amount of wine (i.e. each bottle contains half of a gallon). Therefore, the bottles of imported wine represent 2400/5 = 480 bottles of wine, or 0.0556 of a gallon of wine. Then, assuming two bottles are consumed per person, 1320 (55% of 2400) bottles are consumed by 1320 invitees. This would leave 1080 imported wine remaining. Then, assuming domestic wine is half as pricey per bottle as imported wine, 2400 domestic bottles equal 1200 imported bottles, or 0.222 gallons of wine. Then, 1080 domestic bottles are consumed, and that leaves 2,320 in the cellar, 0.444 gallons.\nNext, it says that each guest brings 1/3 of Jose's total wine, or 1/3 of 65.6 is 22.2, which leaves 1 bottle for every 8.3 invitees.

The questions is all about parallelism, the parallelism in these two examples suggest that a word is being used twice (in the same sentence), but it has to mean different things in each usage. In the example above, it's train's tracks have bn laid.. so that means that 'track' is being used twice in the sentence but it has to mean two different things. The first usage is referring to the tracks that have been laid down, and the second instance is referring to plural of the word, so it could also be parallelism.

Based on the information provided, we can deduce that the parent of the person, e.g., mother, father, etc. is not the one sitting next to the person.\n3. Hence, the correct answer must be \"Her brother.\"\n4. Accordingly, from the answer choices we can conclude that her mother would be sitting next to Her mom, her brother would be sitting next to her brother, her father would be seating next to her father and her cousin would be sitting next to Him, but no brother.\n5. Therefore, the correct option is C: \"her brother\"\n6. This question can be simplified into two questions: 1. What was going on. 2. Who was the person referring to. The context suggests that the person, who was watching, is sitting next to Someone in the same row. To answer the first question we need to know who is the person referring to as the person may be referring to themselves or someone else. For this we need to look at the options and discard those that do not apply.\n7. Based on the option, we know that parent is sitting next to the person, or in the same row, but that is not us. Hence, we can rule out B,C, & E. \n8. Further, she is watching something else, so we can rule out the person who is referring to themselves. \n9.

{"text": "The plumber will gain the most profit by fixing three sinks at his apartment complex and then fixing a toilet, a sink and a shower at a different complex.\n\n### Rationale:The problem states that the plumber is to choose just one of three different jobs, so options 1) and 2) can be removed from consideration, leaving him with just the third choice, which refers to the plumber taking the first job and fixing a sink, a shower, and a toilet at the third apartment complex. Because option 3) does not limit the number of jobs the plumber will take, it is still an option, even though it is suboptimal for the plumber.\n\n### Input 2:A plumber is tasked with fixing three different jobs for three different clients. One job is to fix a clogged sink and toilet costing the plumber $75 and $40 respectively.  The second job is for a customer requiring two bath tubs repaired costing them $30 each.  The third job is to fix a busted gutter.  This last job costs $75.  The plumber charges $35 to a fix a bath tub and $105 to fix a gutter.  Which is the most money he can make?\n\n### Rationales:Since each client only requires one job to be done and we have three different clients, we can only choose the clients' jobs once.  If the plumbers charges $35 to fix a bath tub and  $105 to repair a gutter, then the plumber can only fix one job for each client, which means he will make $540 in total.", "answer": " 250"}
{"text": "The first and most important thing to do is find the final cost of the items James bought.  We can do this by subtracting the value of what James returning and selling things.\n\n```{= 20% of the 700 + 500 }={140 }+{300 }={440 }```\nThe final cost of what James bought is $440.  We can then do some easier calculations to get final answer\nFirst, we can subtract the sale price $440 - 280(Sale) =$160.  Then we can use the percentage and subtract 80(80% of 700) = 60(not $60 or $600). Then we can subtract that $160 - 60 = $100. We have a final cost of $100.\n\n### Rational:\n1. It's important to start with James's final cost because it gives us context for our final answer and allows us to work backward.\n2. To compute the final cost, we need to subtract the value of what James returned and sold, which gives us $440 - $280 = $160, $60(80%), and $100 for a total of $100:  $440 - ($280 + $60) = $100\n\n### Input:\"Average speed is a calculation of a distance traveled per time.

If any dress takes 5 sqm of fabric and 3 hr to make, then it would take (5 * 60 mins / 3) mins for each dress to be made, which equals 900 / 3 = 300 mins.\n4. \n5. Finally, from the data, we can conclude that 56 * 300 = 16800 mins, which is equivalent to 280 hours.\n6.

Write a response that will appropriately address the scenario.\n2. The correct answer is E: resign.\n\n### Explination:-\nThe key information in this scenario is that the company claims their products are top-of-the-line, but the intern found something else. This is a classic example of a democratization gap. The people running the company likely don\u2019t interact with the customers on a daily basis; they don\u2019t see firsthand what problems with poor product quality can actually cause. After the intern discovers this quality issue, he needs to take steps to make sure they are aware of it, but also be prepared for the company to not take him seriously and refuse to take action. At that point, if the intern is in a management role, he could resign. If he\u2019s still just an intern, there\u2019s not much he can do other than report it to the right people.\n\n### Question:A: what is democratization gap\n\nAnswer:\n1. The democratization gap describes a fundamental disconnect that often happens between data scientists who perform research and product managers who ultimately decide what data products actually ship. \n2. Because these roles are often located on different team, the two sides often work with different objectives and goals \u2013 often leading to serious business challenges once products are launched. \n3.

{"text": "$0.35\n\n### Answer Explanation:\nTo begin with, let's start by finding Kurt's savings each day.  Kurt's old refridgerator costs $0.85 per day which implies it costs 30 Cents per hour.  His new energy-efficient refigerator costs $0.45 per day which implies its cost 0.2 per hour.  Therefore he saves $0.40 per day(hour) with the new refridgerator. \n\nSince he saves $0.15 for 24 hours, he saves money for each 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, he's saving $0.35 for 24 hrs in a day in a 30 days month.\n\nAnswer: $0.30", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "He was able to run for 330 minutes.\n\n### Justifications:\n- Jeff committed to run 6 hours during the week. He could run for 300 minutes.\n- On day 1, he cut short his workout by 20 minutes, he was able to run for only 270 minutes. He was 30 minutes short.\n- On day N, he was able to complete his run for 30 minutes, that's 180 minutes\n- Summed up, he was able to achieve 300 + (300 - 270) + 180 = 660 minutes which is equivalent to 11 hours. So during a week, he's able to run for 11 hours which is equivalent to 660 minutes.\n\n*Rationales for the last justification:\n\n- 300 + 180 means 480 minutes which is equivalent 8 hours.\n\n- Adding 480 minutes to 480 (300 + 230) we get 480 + 480 = 960 minutes which is equal to 16 hours. This is to state that over the weeks Jeff was able to run for a total of 16 hours which is equivalent to half a day if he has to run for just 5 minutes.\n- Subtracting the 5 minutes from the 16 hours gives us the total time he could have run for which is 15 hours and 55 minutes.\n\n**Output from the above explanation**\n*330 minutes\n\n### Instructions:\nInput: He finished painting the house.

{"text": "Apparently three men.\n\n### Why?:\nThe answer requires logic and analysis.\n\nThe question implies that a specific store sells both apples and that two men and three women purchased several apples from that same store.\n\nMoreover, the question states that 20 fewer amount of apples were purchased by the men. So, if the two men each purchased 30 apples and 20 fewer amount was purchased by men, then men purchased a total of 50 apples.\n\nSubsequently, 50 - 30 = 20 apples less purchased by men. \n\nSince 30 was less than the amount that was purchased by each woman, we can conclude that the number purchased by women is greater than 30.\n\nHence, the amount purchased by women was equal to 60 apples, where 20 apples + 30 = 50 apples and remaining apples is 60 - 50 = 10.\n\nThus, with one man and three women that bought that specific amount purchased, there will be 40 apples and they have a remainder of 10. So, the total amount purchased is 50.\n\nTherefore, the total number of apples purchased by two men and three women is equal to 2 X 30 + 50 = 50 + 30= 80.\n\nSince the question implies that both men bought at least 30 apples each, then we can conclude that two men and three woman purchased 80 apples.", "answer": " 210"}

{"text": "Gerald has his bags at a density of 40 apples. Gerald's baskets hold 3 baskets each. Pam's basket has 10 baskets each. Since the answer is 3/4, Gerald's baggage has 120 fewer apples than Pam's bag. But we know it won't be that simple. Let's calculate it like this: 120/4 = 30. In simple terms: If Gerald puts 40 apples in his bag then Pam's bag will have 30 apples less. Therefore: 120 - 40 = 80 / 4 = 20. In other words, 20 apples in Pam's bag equals 40 in Gerald's.\n\n### Solution:The question asks us what is true about three of Gerald's four bags. It turns out that Pam's bags contain as many apples as two of Gerald's, and so Gerald's bins contain two more apples than Pam'ss. Accordingly, Gerald's basket contains twice as many apples as Pam'ss.\n\n### Inputs:Sheila's sister has a house on the cliff overlooking the ocean.\nThe cliff is overgrown with vegetation.\n\nSheila's sister uses ropes to maintain the vegetation overhanging her porch.\n\nHelen's sister does not use rope to maintain the vegetation.\n\nWhat is true about Helen's sister's house?\n\n### Demand:Helen's sister's home is less likely to overgrow. \n\n### Soluction:Sheila's and her sister's houses are both vulnerable to overgrowing vegetation because they both share the issue of being overgrown. But Helen's sister uses rope to maintain the overhanging vegetation. So, it's clear that Helen's sister'll prevent her home from being overgrown with vegetations,  and thus, it'll be less vulnerable to the issue of overgrowing vegetations. The implication is that Helen's sister is less likely to have an overgrown home when compared to Sheila.", "answer": " 1200"}

{"text": "First, we need to set up some equations.  Let C be the initial amount of water in the pool, and I be the incremental change in water during each addition of a gallon.  Since we are interested in the amount of time it would take to fill, we must find how the amount of water in the bucket changes over time.  This leads to the equation \\$\\displaystyle \\frac{dC}{dt} = dI = \\frac{0.1}{1.6} \\$ (the amount lost from leaking) and \\$\\displaystyle C = I + C\\$ (where C is the initial amount).  The initial amount of water in our case was 60 gallons. So, we can substitute that into the 8 equations: \\$\\displaystyle 0.1(\\frac{60}{60} + \\frac{1}{1.6}) = \\frac{1}{60}\\$\n\nThe initial amount must remain within 60 gallons, so this initial amount is equal to the amount leaked while adding the first gallon: \\$\\displaystyle \\frac{(1\\cdot 60 + 1.2)}{60} = 1.2 \\approx 1\\$  Therefore, our initial amount of water is \\$ 1 \\$ gallon.

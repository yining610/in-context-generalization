She\u2019s typing a different number of sentences in each scenario for each scenario, which does mean she isn\u2019t typing over and over the same sentence that she started with.

Option B: The bulk warehouse is cheaper since it's charging $19.00 per case instead of $12 per case. However, an option where the bulk warehouse is more expensive can also be interpreted as cheaper as the rate of each can is less.\n3. Option C: The bulk warehouses price is more expensive, since it is at $6.25 while the grocery store's price is at $6.00 per can. Although, since \"more expensive\" could mean that this can also be interpreted as more expensive in a positive way, it could be more beneficial to a user that they can buy a lot for a lower amount. Although, as we can see, with option $5.5 or $6.125, it is more expensive for a lower amount as well. For this reason, D could be ruled as well.\n2. To conclude, we could say that the grocery store is more expensive than the bulk warehouse.

Also, it is plausible that Justin has fewer stickers than Mandy as it states that Justin is given 10 or fewer of them.\nWe can use the information on Mandy and Justin to our advantage in order to solve the equation. It can be said that Colton is remaining with 72-10(Justin) stickers or 72-20 stickers after. This can be determined by dividing 72-2(Mandy) stickers to 3. This gives us an answer of 24 stickers left.\nAnswer:  C: Mandy has 8 more stickers which means Colton has 24 more stickers\n\n### Input/Instruction:The teacher asks for an answer to a division question.\n\n## Expected Response:\n\n### Rationale 1:\nOptions A: The teacher wants the students to show their work and not just the answer.

Given the time, and that it takes each time to make a pizza, we can determine the amount of time Jimmy needs to finish the pizzas.\n3. Using this and the amount of time remaining, including the amount of pizzas that were finished prior to the end of the sale, one can determine how many pizzas were sold in total.\n\n\n### Instructions:Do research based on the assignment\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: For this task, we need to do a research based on the assignment to get some insights.\nRationales:\n1.

However, this is not always possible practically. Thus, democracy as a system can be considered a representative democracy, in which a representative of the people is elected or appointed to be the ruler or leader of their government, thereby representing the common voice against a direct referendum or vote by the people. However, there are certain limitations and flaws of this model as well.\n\nFor example, one such flaw of a representative democracy is that since the elected leaders serve for a limited period of time, they might not necessarily be able to reflect the true nature or the will of the public. Therefore, it should be considered that even when a representative democracy is established, the common people have the sovereign power and influence over the government.\n\n### Comments\n\nI don't think democracy as a representative democracy is enough because it's not a direct reflection of the peoples' will, and how they will feel about how their government'", "answer": " 2"}

Therefore the servings remaining will now contain [15*7], with 105 calories remaining. \n\n### Response 2:\n\nAnswer: Rather than multiplying the servings, we will instead try to subtract the total amount of servings already eaten from the total servings in the entire block, leaving us with [16 - 5].

Choices:  A. put more chips in B. put more chips your mouth C. want to put more ches in your mouth D. want putch them\nRationales: To begin with, the expression 'to put a' is idiomatic. This is often a phrase, e.g. 'to put on a suit'. (Example: 'Please put on your jacket.') This means that the preposition 'in' does not come before the verb in this expression, so this is a fragment. (Example: 'I wan to go home.')\n\nFrom here, we can eliminate D and E because their prepositions and subject are also both incorrect.\n\nThe remaining options are A and C. C has a correct subject and verb, which can be seen with the second word in the sentence. The verb is incorrect here, however. The verb 'want' means 'desire' or 'intend' but these don't fit in the context here. (Example: 'She needs to change the TV.') This seems to be asking what it's like to put the chips in something; C should read: 'You want to put chips in your mouth,' which expresses what it's like.\n\nFor the correct expression, A should be: 'I want to put more chis in my mouth.' This phrase is similar to when we say 'put on a jacket' or 'put shoes on their feet' and so it is also idiomatic, meaning it does not normally come before 'in' or 'on'.\n\nThus, the answer is A: I want to put more chits in my mouth (Example: 'I want to eat them [on your mouth].')\nAnswer: I want to put them in my mouth.", "answer": " 90"}

How many years did pirate Tony go to school?\nA: 4\n\n### Answer:4 years\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following grade math question\n\n### Answer 28\n\n### Input\nWhat letter comes next in the following sequence: GEDHJLMNOQRSUVWXYZ?\nR: Z  (correct)\n\n### Demosntration\nInput: Z was not the correct letter for two reasons.  It wouldn't be a logical letter to come next in the sequence.  It didn't follow the alphabetical pattern.  Therefore the letter that comes next is R.  The next letter in the sequence is R.  It's logical that R is next because it follows the alphabetical pattern.\n\n### Why not Q?\n\nBecause if the sequence was 'Q', then the next letter would be T which is a vowel.  Therefore would not follow the sequence.  In order for it to follow the sequence R would have to be after it, and Q cannot be after R.\n\n### Input2:What letter comes after the letter Q in the following sequence: ZYQAZYQAZY?\nR: K (correct)\n\n\n### Demonsration2\nInput: K was not the correct letter because it didn't follow the sequence.  It was not after Q it had to be Q before K to follow the sequence.  Therefore, it had to be A: K.\n\n### What letter is missing in this sequence? AABBBAE", "answer": " 14"}
{"text": "To get to an answer we begin by figuring out the rate of elephant egress from the park. From the data provided in the passage, we can see that the exodus lasted 4 hours (120 minutes). Let n be the number of elephants that left the park in this period, and assume that each elephant left after a period time of 120 minutes (that is, we can assume elephants all left at the same time. We also know there was a rate of 2880 elephant/hour. Subtracting out the initial amount of the 30,020 elephants, we are left with a number of 288 elephants in 120 minutes or 4 hours). The rate equation then becomes:\nn = (-b)/a, where a is the amount of time (days, hours, or minutes) and b is the number of elephant per time interval (for example, 4). Using this equation, we can plug in values for our variable, n, to get the following equation: n = (-2,880)/120. Splitting the numerator and removing parentheses we end up with:\nn = -23 (.388888)/120. Solving this equation for n we have:\nn = 22.6868. Plugging this into our original equation we get:\n(-22.687)/4 = (2880). Dividing by 4 to simplify, we are left with: (-61.7188) = -2880\nDividing both sides by -2880, we have:\n61.71/288 = -1\nThe rate of elephants entering the park is -1 elephant per hour; however since the rate of elephants egressing the park occurs at 2880/4, then the final rate was -1/(2880/20) or -0.00495/hour.\nTherefore, option C, -0.005/hour is the correct answer.\n\n### Input:(Daily) Weekly Apartment Rents\n* New York: $3,000\n* Boston: $2,", "answer": " 1500"}

{"text": "Input: Write the correct number of _________________, which Jess needs to walk until she reaches work. Choices:  A/nine B/ten C/four D/thirteen E/eight F/three G/ten\nRationales:\n1. The question is explicitly stating that Jess has to walk 8 more blocks to reach her job.\n2. Therefore, by process of elimmination we can discard Option A: Nine, because if we subtract the number 9 from 11 (the distance between Jess's home and work), we get 2. This means it would take Jess 9 blocks to cover the distance between her home and work and not 8 blocks which the question demands.\n3. Thus, we are able to dismiss A/nine.\n4. Additionally, we can ignore option B/ten, since it only adds an extra distance between Jess's previous stop and the end of work which would not be as relevant, as we are only focused on covering the final 8 blocks.\n5. Option C/four also does not make sense as the question explicitly asked for Jess to walk 8 more, meaning she has one more block than what option C (which asks for 4 blocks) would account for.\n6. Option D/thirteen does make some sense, by adding an extra block, but we don't know if Jess is done yet, and so we can't be sure how much more distance she needs to cover.\n7.

She is dividing 64 pretzles, four times the amount of gold fish, and 32 sugar as there are 16 kids. Therefore, she has to divide 256 by 16 in order to get the correct number of items. Dividing 16 by four gives 4, which is the number of gold fish. Next, divide 4 by 1 to get the number of pretzels, then multiply again by four which gives four more pretzels. From this she has to divide the number 88 (with 26 as remainder) by 16 in which case, she will get 5 1/2 and 2 as remainder.\n\n### Input : The number of items in a small bag used for sand in a sandbox (i.e., a quart) is 800/16 (e.g., eight ounces).

We will represent this number as 'D'.\n\nNow we have the numbers of cats, and the part of the total cats we can conclude that part of Leonel's cats equals:C - 12(number of total cats owned by Anthony).\n\nNow substitute this for Leonel's cath number(D-12(C-12))\n\nFind the total number of dogs by subtracting the part of cats from the part of the total number:D - 12(C-2)\n\nNow, finally, all we have to do is to add the total numbers of cats and dogs:\n\nNow, we have 2(number of total dogs) + 10(number of total caths).\n\nThe answer would be : 2 + 10.", "answer": " 27"}

You should go inside the store because if you are a veteran, the owners will give you discounts. The store owners are nice people and they will help us. After all, we risked our lives for America. Veterans day 2019 is on November 11 and the store is open on Veterans day as usual. Veterans day is a way of showing respect and gratitude for our veterans. Even though Veterans day is on November 10, 2019, the store will be open on November 9, 2018 and November 11, 2017.\n\n(1) The first time I was in the store was at a time in 2018 that is in the future compared to the second occurrence in 2017 that is in the past. Thus, it's safe to conclude that I was first in the store in 2019 and not in 2011.\n\n(2) On November 10, the store was not open on Veterans Day.\n\n(3) You should go inside the shop in 2012 because if you are a war veteran, the store's owners will give you a 20% discount on the entire bill. That means, \"Thank you for your valiant service. Have a good day.\"\n\n(4) The store is open this Veterans Day, Saturday,", "answer": " 180"}

{"text": "### Input 2:Stephanie is going to decorate 16 cupcakes for a party. She has a total of 72 candles. She wants 6 cupcakes to have 4 candles each and 10 to have 3 candles each. How can she ensure that all the cupcakes have an equal total amount of candles and that each cupcake does not have a multiple of 12?\n\n### Output 2:Firstly, she can get an extra 12 candles to ensure that she has enough to fill all the cupcakes. Now consider the candlesticks for each cupcake. If she puts in: 12 candlesticks, her arrangement would be: 4 * 3 cups + 3 * 3 cups (so that each cup is even with the next cups). Now we know the total we are going to have, but we don't know the number of candles. But, since she needs all 16 to have an equal count of candlesticks, we can subtract to get the number of candlesticks each cup would require. 2 * 3 cups = 6 candlesticks which we already have, so we are left with 1 * 3 cups candlesticks (or 3 candlesticks). 12 + 3 = 15 candlesticks per 16 cupcaks. So each has a multiple of 15.\n\n### Response 2:A way to ensure that all 16 cupcasks have an equal total amount o candles, is to use 72 as her initial base (72 is a multiple of 16).

{"text": "We're required to find the price of one lunch. We can get the number of lunches by using the total number of students and then applying the formula lunches = Total number of students / (# of students in each class). To get the price of 1 lunch we need to use P = (P(lunches) * cost/lunches). To keep things simpler, lets say we have 30 lunches. Then, p(lunches) = 30 (the same for all lunches). Thus, p(lunch) is 30  * 2.10 (total cost of hamburger + cost of carrots + cost of cookie = 6.30). Now we know that P = 6.3 30 2.1 (0.5x30) + 0.2 30 2 (42). Thus, the total cost of one lunch is 6.3 0.2 0.5 + 0.2(42) + 1.44. The answer is then 1.44 0.5(6.3 3(2.1 5(2.2)5.

{"text": "The amount of rounds played will be 3 - the amount of rounds played for her to be left with 60 points after she loses 20 points.\n\n### Rationales: This question is looking for the amount of time that an object is played, not the amount of rounds. This is because the question states that Jane ends up with 10 points and that she loses 2 of those 10, meaning in total she ends up with -2 points (60-80 = -2) instead of 11 points (60+80+10=120). Because of the -2 points, she played three rounds to get the original 60 points. This can be proven by the following equation 60 - (-2) = 60 + 2 = 62. -6 = 3.\n\n### Response2: The rationales for this problem are identical to the rationales for the first question. However in this scenario, the amount of rounds that Jane played is simply the amount of rounds needed to reach 60 points. We can eliminate the answer of 3 because the question asks for how many rounds she played, where in the second question it asks for the amount of rounds left.", "answer": " 8"}

As for the denominator or population of people who do not know German (0.75), we multiply by 100 to obtain 75%.\n4. As for the numerator, 20 is subtracted from 20 representing the percentage of English speakers of the world's total population to obtain 0.20, followed by a multiplication by 100.\n5.

So there are 2 tasks. Let's call them task 1 and task 2.

{"text": "Input:At football tryout, the coach \n### Demonstraion:\nInput: The coach wanted to see  who could throw the ball  the farthest.\nRationales:\n\n1. The coach was trying to evaluate the skills of the players using a competition to decide who could throw the ball further. This indicates that the coach was more focused on the distance of the ball, rather than the accuracy of the throw.\n\n2. By using the phrase \"farther\" and \"further\" rather than the \"farthest\" and \"most\" respectively, it is clear that the coach was not looking for an absolute value for the distance of the throw, but rather a comparison of how far the players could throw. Moreover, the statement that Grant threw the ball \"25 percent farther than  Parker\" means that the coach did not want to know the absolute distance of Grant's throw, but rather the difference in distance between that of Parker's and Grant's throw.\n\n3. Similarly, the statement that Kyle threw the ball \"2 times farther than Grant,\" implies that the coach was not interested in knowing the absolute distance of Kyle's throw but was more concerned with comparing the distance of Kyle'\n\n    throw and Grant's throw, which means that there were more important factors in determining the outcome of the competition. By extension, this also means that the coach was more interested in the difference in distance between the throw of Parker and Kyle rather than the absolute distance of Kyles' throw, indicating that the coach was more concerned with the comparison of the ability of the players rather than the absolute distance that they could throw.\n\nOutput: By combining the information provided in the question regarding Grant and Kyle's throws in comparison to Parker, we can infer that Kyle threw the football 2 times farther than Parker and Grant threw the ball 50% farther than Parker.\n\n### Inputs:  A.

Bella bought stamps at post office - Indicates she bought stamps at post offices\n\n2. Some of the stams had a snowflak design, some had a trandem - Snow flakes is used to describe the design of a stamp, so when given that some of the design are snowflake, Bella could of bought snowflake design. Trandem as a design may of been made into a stamp.\n\n3. And some had a rose desgn - Rose design as a stamp seems unlikely, so we can eliminate rose as a stamp.\n\n4. She bought 11 snowflke stamps - Bella bought 10 snow flake stamps\n5. She bought 9more truck stamps so that she had 19 truck stamps but only 11 snow flake stamps. - Therefore Bella bought 19 snow flake stamps and 11 truck stamps\n6.13 less rose stamps so she had 19 rose stamps but she had 20 truck stamps 11 truck stamp she didn't buy rose stamps - Therefore Bella had 19 rose stamp and 20 truck stamp, therefore Bella bought 20 trucks and 19 rose stamp.

In the given example, \"Sarah is my bbest friend\" implies that the subject \"Sarah\" is the best friend mentioned.\n2. Using the knowledge above, it's easy to guess that the subject of the second sentence is the same as its antecedent (object).

As a vowel is a letter that forms a part of a syllable and has a corresponding sound, it can be inferred that the one not picked will be one of the four other forms of the letter 'a'.\n2. If you exclude the consonants such as 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f' and 'k' 'o' is the only consonant in the English alphabet that does not have a corresponding sound.\n3.

We do this by multiplying the number of houses by the number of gnomens in each house.\n2. So, there are three gnomes in each house, and 20 houses. This means there are 60 gnomes in total.\n3. Now, we calculate the number of rows.\n4. There are 100 gnomes in their front garden, meaning there are 16 houses with 100 gnome in the front gardens.\n5. Since three gnomes means 3 x16 = 48 gnomes, this leaves us with 100 - 48 = 52 gnomes in the other houses.\n6. In conclusion, there are 20 houses on the row.", "answer": " 8"}

After completing the initial route, the airplane returns and this second round trip covers the return journey.\n3. Combining both routes, the total travelled is 1096 + 1096 = 2192 miles.\n4.

{"text": "Answer: Option C: 12 cubic feet of water\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Firstly, we can exclude option A which states that the fish cannot survive on less than half the water. This is because she already added a small amount of water and her fish are fine so this rule cant apply.\n2. Option B says that half of the amount is the appropriate amount to fill an aquarium of the dimensions mentioned. However, the given question gives the number as 4 feet long,6 feet wide and 3 feet high. By simplifying, we observe that the volume (V) of a rectangle can be represented as V = L*W*H or V = 6*2*3 = 36 cubic inches. Subtracting this from the specified 3*12 = 36 cubes gives 0.67, which is not the appropriate final answer.\n3. Similarly, option D gives the answer 24. However, 24 does not divide into the dimensions of Nancy's aquarium and is not thus a feasible answer.\n4. Option C is the most feasible choice. This is because with the volume of 12 cubes(6*2*1.5) we can find the answer for the dimensions of Nancy' s aquarium and the final volume as we know that the dimensions of Nancy'a aquarium are 4*6*3 = 48 and volume as 12*6*3 =144(144*0.500=12 as the answer).\n5. Now we solve the question using the Pythagoras Theorem. As per the Pythagoran theorem,\n**square** of the hypotenuse\u00b2= the sum of squares of the other two sides. So, in the current circumstances, the total surface area of the aquarium is 590*38.405(square of hypotenuse)=32842324= 3284\n6. And the length of the hypotenuse is 4*6= 24.\n7.

Let c = 2x and u = 3x, yielding the equation: 2x - 2x + xy = 135x - xy = 33x - xy = u; 2x + x = 132/2 x, yielding u = 11/2 x - x = 11x/2 - x = 9/2x = 45/2 x = 22.5, x = 23.79. This is then divided by 2 (23.79/2), yielding the total vegetable amount produced by the garden = 11.895.

As a result, they find that eating pee provides them with the necessary nutrients, so they do it. We know the dog's diet is made mostly of protein as the wording of the question only mentions \"protein\" and doesn't mention other nutrients. On the other hand, the food they eat presumably does not contain any pee, so eating it doesn't make sense.\n\n### Output : Dogs eat their own pee to get the 5% protein they miss from being mostly made up of protein in the first place.\n\n### Response :", "answer": " 9"}

Ruby and Kyle finish eating the cake 25 minutes after Ruby sits down, that means Ruby will be **1/3** the way through eating the cake.\n2. Ruby being **1/3** way through eating the whole cake she ate a **1/3** of the cake and the remaining **2/3**, Kyle ate half, a **1/2** portion of what was remaining.\n3.

D: When a car accident happens and the police arrive and say \"Do not move!  This is a police investigation!\"\nRationales:\n1. The provided context reveals that 'The' is an implied pronoun in the sentence.\n2. We can eliminate A: When a boss says, \"everybody get ready for an emergancy drill in 5 minute\" - The word's 'boss' and 'anybody' are the subjects of the sentence, while 'the' is not. Thus, the pronoun, 'the' isn't implied in this scenario. Hence, the correct choice is not options A.\n3. However, the correct answer can in fact be found in option B: When a new waier walks in the bar and the bartaender says, \"Honey\" - Here, both, 'honey' and 'the' are implied, where 'the' is referred to as the subject, and 'honey' is it's predicative complement, demonstrating that option B is the correct answer choice.\n4.

This process follows the logic of incrementing the second digit of the sequence by 1 to reflect removing the first item, resulting in 1,3,4,6 and then 9.\n3. Since the same process is to be applied to each of the other groups of 5 numbers (resulting in 2,4,5,10 etc.), it is logical to say that the original question was written in a sequence to reflect 7+6-7+5+14-6+2-7+8-11.\n4. Thus, we can say that the answer is 9, which is equal to 7+6-4-7+5+3-6+8-2. The given sequence is reversed to give 9. The answer is 9.\nAnswer: 9\n\nInput: 6 *2 - 4 -4 -1 / 2 - 4 / 2 - 6 / 2 + 1 *2 + 2 - 2\nRationales: The question has multiple operations - multiplication, then division, then addition and subtraction, followed by another division operation.\n1. The division operation in the second line is given the expression: 6*2 - 4 - 4 - 1/ 2 - 4/ 2 - 6/ 2 + 1*2 + 2 -2. This follows the pattern that all the positive numbers of 6 would give a multiple of 2, and all the negative numbers of 4 would follow the pattern of -1/ -4 etc. thus resulting in a pattern of positive results for the 2nd line.\n2. The subtraction operation in the third line is given the expression 4 - 4, resulting in 0, since all the values are positive.\n\n3. The addition operation in the fourth line is given the expression -2 - (-2),", "answer": " 36"}
{"text": "4 bags have a total of 24 /4, or 6 kg each. One bag has a total of 6 kilos. Another bag had 3kg before the incident, but has now lost 3kg. That leaves 1/2 of the third bag or two kilos on the floor. The third bag now only has 4 kg instead of 4 + 2 = 6kg.  So, the final result is 24 divided by 4, and then subtract 6+2, which results in 24 divided by a total of 8 or 3kg per bag after the sugar was spilled so there should be 6 bags left with 3 kg in each bag. This is why C is the correct answer.\n\n### Input. Write a program named \u201cAdditionCalculator.cs\u201d that reads the value from the user when the \u201cStart\u201d button is pressed.

{"text": "Input: The question mentions the book count each day.  However, it doesn't indicate how many pages Nico reads each day.\nRationales: There are 2 possible ways to get 51 pages from 3 books.  The first way is Nico borrows 3 separate books on different days, each book being read on a different day.  In that case, the last count, Nico reads 12 pages on day 2 + 20 pages on day 1 + 12 pages on Wednesday = a total of 55 pages.\nThe second way is that Nico borrows 1 book on Monday, which he reads till Tuesday. He then borrows another book on Tuesday which he reads till Wednesday.  In that case Nico reads 1 book on Monday with a total of 30 pages.  On the second day Nico again reads the same book he read on Monday, adding an additional 12 pages (for a total of 22 pages) on Day 2.  He then borrows another new book on Day 3, which he reads till Wed, adding another 12 pages. This is equivalent to 34 + 12 + 12 = 68 pages.  Adding these, 68 pages from Day 2 and 30 pages on Day 1, we get a total of 98 pages.\nHence, the correct answer is option (B).\nAnswer: (B): 98 pages\n\n### Explanation:\nResponse by the teacher or peer reviewer:\nThe explanations and rationales are adequately detailed. The response uses words of limited vocabulary compared to some complex sentences. It could be improved by incorporating more words to replace or improve these statements such as, \"However, while it is true Option A does not specify reading is optional, Option D is possible because the question asked how many pages, implying it is not necessarily the total of how many books he read\" for example, to be more concise.  The explanation clearly summarized the solution to the question and explained why Option B had to be ruled out based on context.

{"text": "The math problem involves adding the time needed to wash a pile of various items.\n\n### Rationales: 1.) The first step is to determine the time it takes to wash one pile of each item. To do this, we can subtract the time needed to washing the towels from the time needed to was the sheets. Then we can subtract the time to was the sheets from the time it takes to do all towels and sheets together.\n\n2.) The next step in the problem involves determining \"how many minutes total will it taker\" which is, you guessed it! the total for the three numbers that came before. It doesn't seem too hard, right?\n\n###  A. After subtracting the 30 minutes to do the sheets and 60 minutes total for washing the towls, we do 60-30=30 (minutes needed).\n\n###  B.

Therefore, the subtraction problem is: 30 - 60=30 (this step takes up the 30 minutes the problem says).\n\n### C. After two subtractions, we have been asked how much is 30 + 60.

How many referees does each game have in total?\nRationales: Firstly, 47 refers to the referees that will be used for the first game, while the second game will use 36 refereees. Thus, the answer to how many referees for each game is simply 47 + 36 = 83.\n1. To provide a response, one can apply the concept of numbers to solve the mathematical problem whereby they are given two numbers; thus, they can create the number 83 by using the addition operator, which is 47 + 9 + 36 to arrive at their answer.\n\n### Rationale:\nIt is acceptable and also standard to describe 47 and 36 as the numbers of referees in two games, since both games have been mentioned in the problem.

This information can be used to answer the question in multiple ways.For example, he can plan to use 5 liters per trip(30 + 20 km) and 1 liter of extra(to cover any fuel surplus after the 30 and 30 km trips)Thus, he needs to use 3 litres of fuel to travel distance of 50 km.This could be a possible response.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider that the information provided indicates a total usage of 5 liters in two trips(30 and 25 km) and not a total sum of 35 liters used in two trips(60 km), that is the actual distance he would be travelling in total.If the actual sum is 60 km, this information would not help him plan his fuel usage.The provided information only helps answer what fuel would be needed for a single journey, no matter how long or short the journey is.This means that in order to understand the correct use of the information that is given in the question, we need to determine how the additional 1 litre of fuel is used.In this case, it is quite clear that John will have to account for the fuel surplus he might have left after the 20 km journey, and the surplus might have been due to a number of reasons ranging from unforeseen circumstances or human error.In conclusion, the correct answer to the question follows from the statement that John travels on two trips of trip 30 km and trip 20 km.\n\n### Alternative Input\n\n> 1.John uses 5 litres of fuel per km to drive. > > 2.

{"text": "She stole 53 apples, because Carla had 81 altogether so 53 was the difference between her total and hers alone.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. There are three reasons why 53 is the correct answer to the above question\n2. Reason 1:\n   1. If the total apples Carla put in her bag is 79 then subtract it's from 81 and the difference would be 2 or 53.\n   2. This means that Buffy stole 22 extra apples from Carla.\n3. Reason 2:\n   1. Carla's number of apples she had left to carry was 8 so subtract that from 79 and the difference would be -7 i.e. she got -7 apples which means Buffy stole 79- (-7) i.e. 53.\n4. Reason 3:\n   1. We already know the answer is 53. But the reason Carla only had 53 remaining because each apple weighs 77.29 oz or 686g and 81 multiplied by 686 is equal to 53106g. So subtract that from 127 i.e. Carla's total, and the difference would be just 53 which means Buffy stolen Carla 5,3106- 53= 53.\n5. Thus, the correct answer to the question is 53.", "answer": " 45"}

{"text": "The question asks for an exact answer because this is a graded problem, the response does not need to be specific by including rounding or unit conversions.\n\nThe flow rate is constant and equal the to the total liters per minute, 12 liters/minute.\n\nBecause Robi wants to fill a 360 liter tub in 2 liters/minutes and the flow rate is equal to 12 liters and the airtight cap is not perfect, one liter escapes from the tap in one minute.\n\nHence, after Robi lets the water run for one minute, 1 liter will be left in the 120 liter. Now, the flow rate is 12/2 liters/min, hence, he can fill 60 liters (60 liters/min). Then, the 120 liters + that 60 liters will be 180 liters.\n\nHe will do the method of opening and closing with the water supply and the air for 24 seconds. Then, 2 liters will escape every second, which will be 48 liters in 1 second. From the equation, the difference is 360 - 48 = 292, which will be filled by 48 liters. Hence, the water in tub has only the cap of 292 and then some time, which will let 1 liters leak out per minute, that is 1/60 of the liters per second.\n\n292 is 6 times 48, so it would take 360 seconds to fill up the remaining 92 liters.

{"text": "Solution: We can use the Binomial Distribution, that is a probability distribution of the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials which each trial having two possible outcomes. So we have to calculate the mean, and variance in both independent and dependent events. In this case, the mean of the set of 16 pandas will be 11 and the variance will be 2. Then we can use the method of generating independent random trials and find out the number of pandas in a set that would become pregnant. For this we can find the binomial distribution for 25% successes in a sequence of 100 trials to find the number of pandas that got pregnant after matting.\n\nAnd hence using this we can find more values of n and x to calculate the mean and variance.

(6.666 cows x 6 weeks = 39.98)\n2. Then we divide 2160 (1666+5) / 6 and get (2160 / 6) = 360.\n3.

{"text": "1. What is the average of 19 hours? 2. What is 20% more than that?\n\n### Demo:\nRationales:\n1. The first step is to calculate the average of the 12 hours. The hours multiplied by money raised gives us 60,000. Divided by 12, this gives us an average of 5000.\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hj0/data-structure_and_algorithms_solver/master/images/2021-02-08-00000.jpg)\n2. Now to get the 20% more that we were asked for. 20% is half your original amount multiplied by 0.2 or 10%. The original amount is 5000 per 12 hour. This means that 20% of 500 is 1000.\nThe total amount after 12 hours is 60000/12, which rounds down to 5000, since this is what the average was. The next 14 hours multiplied by 1.2, gives the amount as 5000 + 1000 = 6000, which accounts for the extra 20%.\n![image](https:/raw.githubusercontent/hj0/mega-project/master/images/7600480.png)", "answer": " 144000"}

However, the question doesn't explicitly state this and the only time mentioned is walking. Hence, A as an answer option is ruled out.\nB: 125% of the dogs day and 160% of its morning imply 1/5 of the day spent on walking.

{"text": "We have to find the gallons of water needed for all washes that include/do not include bleach. \n\nA) The number of gallons of water used for the heavy wash is 20. We multiply the water used by the number of heavy washes, which is 2. For all washes that include bleach (the heavy one and the one where bleach is on and off), we use the water used for the heavy (20) wash. For all washes where bleach is not used, we use the water used during normal washes, which is the number (10) of normal washes divided by 2 for the light ones and by 3 for regular washes. The number of normal washes equals 3, since every (total number of) loads include heavy and regular washes (1).\nThe number of gallons of used water for every load is 10, 1, 2 and 2.\nIf we multiply the number of gallons (10, 1 and 2) by 2 to calculate the required number of liters for every load, the result is 20, 2, 4, and 4, respectively. Finally, since 3 loads need bleach and 2 loads need to be bleach free, 3 * 20 and 2*4 must be added to 20 and 4 liters respectively for each of the 3 loads with bleach and 2 * 2 or 2 liters added for each of the 2 loads without bleach. Thus, our final answer is 2*20+2*4+2*2+2=60.\n\nB) There must be 10 gallons left, since each load uses 20 gallon of water for the heavy wash and 20 gallons are used in total in the heavy wash(2).

This involves simplifying the expression 3/4 + 4/4, which reduces to 7/8. Next, multiplying each fraction by its reciprocal, gives 3/7 + 4/7, which translates to 11/49.\n\nNext, multiplying by 49/49 yields an answer of 11/2436. However, since the chance of success is 1 - the chance of failing, we only need to subtract the two values for the loss probability and the success probability to get our answer.\n\nRaising each fraction by 8 and multiplying yields 53/18 with a chance of success of 53/102 on the dice.\n\n### Input\nChoices: The question asks for a person, not group, that does not meet at least one requirement.\n\nRationals: The answers could include choosing a person that does not meet the requirement of being a man.

{"text": "Gina having two bank accounts means that she and Betty share the money equally. But the bank statement stated that each bank account has a quarter of Betty's balance in it. If Betty's balance is $3,500 and her money is shared evenly, then her money would be quarter of $3,50$.\nSo the total balance would be $3,50+3,50+875 which equals to $7,575.50.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The question asks about the balance of Gina's bank accounts, which is only true if the amount of money each person has is equal.\n2. By looking at the other options, we can see that option A: Each account has $326 in it is out of scope as the question does not ask about the accounts.\n3. Similarly, option B: The first account has $3,505 each and the second is $1,000 is a reasonable and plausible option. However, this can be eliminated by stating that the money given in question D which is given by a bank clerk is equal for both people.\n4. Furthermore, the next options which ask about Betty's account are ruled out as they are similar to option B and can be disregarded.\n5. Option C: Each account has two quarter of Betty's money leaves a balance of $1,005 for each person which does not make sense based on the rest of the equation as Gina and Betty are sharing the same money.\n6. Lastly, option E: One account has $3,454 and the other has $1,100 provides an answer that makes sense however it cannot be calculated through a simple equation.\n7.

To finish 20 of them each in 5 days you will need 20/5, or 4.\n5. To get the 4ths you can do 5/20 which is 1/5, and you can also just use decimals with 4. John knows there are 5 days left after this.\n6. To watch 1 show per day, he would have to watch 1/20, or 0.05 episodes in 1 day.

It is a question of the calculation and not about asking about the total reimbursement value.\n\n2:\nThe first step is to rephrase the question in terms of its constituent parts.\n\n(1) On Friday, Remy paid $5340 for every 150 pieces if furniture, or $134 for every piece of furniture.\n(2) Later that evening, the accountant discovered that a intern sales department had double charged Remm.\n\n(3) So Sally's Woodworker's was supposed to receive $134 * 150 =$19900 instead of $19900.\n\nThus the company reimburses Remey for $1990, minus what they were supposed to receive originally, which is $1990*.75, which is $1472.5.\n\n3:\nThe final number that we get is $93145.\nSince, 1) We have an absolute answer and 2) The response is correct, we have the answer for the problem.\n\nAnswer: $9314.5.\n\n## 1 - Question\n- How much is Remy supposed to reimburse the Woodworker Co. by the end of the day?\n(Note: You can add the amount to $9314 or subtract the amount from $9314; or write \"The amount Remey has to reimburse is $\u2026\u2026. so he\u2019s $\u2026\u2026. more in debt than he was.\"\n\n## 2 - Question\n- A: The Woodworker Co. reimbursed Remey $9314 *.25 = $7531.\n- C: The Woodworker Co pays him $9314- $2155.5  = $7158.5\n- E: He was reimbursed $", "answer": " 600"}
{"text": "Catriona has 20 fish in her aquarium.\n\n### Explanation:\nInput: How many fish does Caitriona have in her aquaarium? Explain your answer. Choices: A: eight B: four C: fourteen D: twenty E: none\n\n#### Demonstration: \n1. The first thing we should note in this question is that the sentence \"Also, she has twice as mauy guppieas as angelfish\" in the first paragraph doesn't match the information given in the body paragraph that talks about Catriona, which is \"She has 8 goldfish and 4 more angelfrihs than goldfish\"\n2. Since there isn't any other information about Catrionia that mentions her number of angelfish, then it's logical to assume that since Catriona has two angelfishes and each angelfish weighs 3 grams, this means that each angelfish weight equals 6 grams in total.\n3. This can be seen in the calculations in the final equation since it says \"2a=4a\" that has the same answer of 8.\n\n#### Example:\nA). She has 8 goldfish, 2 guppies, and 4 angelfish.\nB). There are no explanations given about catriona's aquarium\nC) We have the information of \"She has 8 Goldfish and 4 more Angelfish than Goldfish\" and that \"She has four more angelfish than Goldfish.\" This means that Catriona has 12 angelfish.\nD).

{"text": "Input:The question asks the student to find a value. Choices: A: 150 B: 50 C: 100 D: 250 E: 75\nRationales: Firstly it is noted that 'half the number of minutes' is a phrase that indicates the answer is going to be in whole number. As a result A: 15o B: 50 is ruled out.\n\nWe see that option C: 10o is also ruled out because it says that he worked 300 minutes on Wednesday while Matt worked for 4 hours and 30 minutes on Monday, therefore when we add 300 on Monday we are getting 700, while C: 10 is a value that is less than 700. Hence, we can eliminate C:100 from the choices.\n\nThus, we are left with A: 15, B: 50 and E: 250. Now it is noted that the difference is 5 hours and 50 minutes, which is less than 1 hour. This indicates that the difference isn't going to be 1 hour. Hence, we can discard option E: 75.\nNow, we subtract 550 minutes from the value on Monday to get the value on Wednesday, which is 750 minutes. However, option B: 50 does not take this into account, and therefore, cannot be the right choice.\n\nThis reduces the number of options to either C: 10 or A: 15. However, as noted earlier C: 10 cannot be correct because the number of minutes in the work on Monday is higher than 700 minutes.\n\nThis reduces us to options: A: 10, which results in the right answer.\n\nAnswer: A: 175\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the next five mathematical questions.\n\n### Student response:\n5,2,6.

We are given in the statement that the number of rainy days in November = 15\n4.

{"text": "Input:Lao can sell each chicken Choices:  A:$1.50 B:$1.30 C:$1.20\nRationales: Looking through the provided options, there are some obvious differences such as for example A: selling at $1.50 per chicken.\n1. In this case, each chicken is worth 1.5 times more than the feed it needs while C: Selling at $1.20 per chicken; this case means that each chicken is worth less than the feed it needs.\n2. In fact, this may even be the case as the answer is option C: $1.20.\n3. In C: Each chicken needs two pounds of feed per day for it's lifespan from hatching to being sold, therefore, since Lao is farming 100 chickens which means that he needs to feed them for a total of 2000 pounds of feed per day; this leads to the conclusion that 20 pounds of feed per chicken will only last a day at most, and thus, this will have to go through the entire process of feeding several times over the course of its lifespan, leading to a $65 profit.\n\nSo, the final answer is C: $1.30.\n\nInput: 17 x 1.54 - 45 Choices:  A:@12.04 B:@0.82 C: @42.28\nRationales: As expected, option A: $12.04 is incorrect - by cross multiplying and dividing, the answer would instead be $14.23\n\nInput: The distance from the start of the race to the first checkpoint is 20km.

{"text": "ANSWER: 1490\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\nThe first two equations describe the two parts of the question with the first one describing the people that Martin invited from his hometow and the second one detailing people he invited from his school.\nWe know that 5/5 = 1. This means that Martin invited 5 people from hometown.\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives us 10 - 5 = 5 which means that Martin invited 10 times as many people from his hometwon as his school.\nSince 10 people were divided equally, we can assume that he invited 5 people from each of 2 towns which leaves us with Martin inviting the rest of 10 people from his school.\nThe last line is given in terms of \"remaining invitations\" so we need to assume that there must be something left after removing 20% of total people.\nHowever, because it is stated that there are 200 remaining invitations, we can multiply the invitations by 200/20 and arrive at 1000.\nSince 5/20 = 1/4, we can assume that Martin invited 250 people from the sports club, leaving us with 1000/250 remaining.\nThe numbers that we are not left with are the ones that are stated in terms of percentages.\nTherefore, we can apply the rule that percent equals out of 100 and subtract the parts given.\nThis formula gives: (70% * (200+1000)) + (30% * 1420) = 1490.\n\nThe number of parties I have attended\n### Task:\nWrite a Python program that simulates random number 10000 times and shows the number of parties attended by the user:\n```\nparties = 0\n# loop #\nfor i in range(10000):\n    # random party #\n    parties += random.randint(1, 5)\n    print(1000, parties)\n```\n### Instruction\n\n\n### Instructions\nWhat is the sum of the first 12 terms of the Fibonacci sequence?\nYou can use either", "answer": " 36"}

Should Western powers pursue democracy only where it is politically advantageous?\"\n\n### Response(10pt):\n\nIn response to the question posed, I believe that democracy is still a worthwhile cause to pursue and spread across the globe. The notion of democracy is defined as being rule of the people, by the people and for the people (i.e. the PEOPLE of a nation). However, there are instances that democracy and democratization have been used as a means of control and coercion by the governments and the international community of these institutions. When this occurs, the people are denied their role to have a say in how their government will be run.\n\nOne of the more important reasons that democratic nations would be advantageous in the pursuit to spread democracy is that of the economic development for citizens.

If the ratio of elderly women to elderly men is 6 : 5, what is the number of elderly women over the age of 65 in that suburb?\n\nRationales:\n\nLet the number of elderly males be m. As the number of elderly females is 4 times more than the number of elderly male, it is given by 4m.\n\nWe have 6m:5m = 6:5, which gives 6m - 5m = 6 - 5, i.e. 1.\n\nSo, the number of 65-year-old women is 1.

{"text": "In the equation above, we know that the sum of Fred's weekly allowance is 22 dollars. However, there are two values for Fred's allowance. The first one is 22 dollars itself and the other one is the 14 dollars at the end of the week. This implies that the total of Fred's allowance is not 22 dollars, but rather an answer choice which needs to be found by eliminating the value for 14 dollars and calculating Fred's allowance using the equation 22 = x.\n\nI did this by first subtracting 14 from both side of equation, thereby achieving the following equation: 22=x - 14 (x-14). By rearranging this equation so that it read x=(22-14), we are able to determine that Fred's  weekly allowance is indeed 6 dollars.

{"text": "I'm confident that Pete would leave around at 0525 hours.

However, the old lady's referring to Tim as \"my friend\" may signify that Tim is likely more of an acquaintance of the old lady since a more friend-like term would have been used.\nC: Old is also not plausible since the old lady has referred to Tim as \"my\" companion rather than as \"my old\" companion.\nD: Lively is likely false since the old lady has stated that she had fallen from the stage that she was walking atop of and implied that she had a frightful fall.

In the rounds between B and C we get 58 and with no information or distance, no method of calculating the extra distance will result in a precise answer.  Thus, we can disregard those.

{"text": "Jake drinks 0.6 ounces of alcohol.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. Instruction states that Jake splits his shots with a friend. In other words, Jake and his friend share a shot of alcohol.\n2. Jake and his friend each have 8 shots, they divide 8 shots between friends, each person having 4 shots.\n3. Each shot is 1.5 oz, or 44 mL. 40mL is half of 80mL or 1.5 ounce is 80mL\n4. Then, 8 X (44ml/shot) =440ml total per person, each has 220ml (2/8ths), each having 44ml for a shot.\n5. Then, 86ml is 220ml/2 = 1.028, 86ml =.6oz\n6.

Y will be determined from the equation.\n\nY will be the first variable. To find Y, write the equation Y^3 =.1y\n\nY^3 must be squared: Y^3= Y*Y*Y which will be Y*Y*Y*Y*1/2. Since, 1/2 will have the power of 6, Y must be cubed. Therefore, Y will need to be 3rd powered by itself.\n\nThe variable X will be determined with the first letter representing the variable and the first number representing the power. Therefore, X = 2Y\n\nThe new equation would be 2*Y^3 + 10 = X+10\n\nThen solve for X: 12Y^3 =2*X\n\nThen write 2Y^3 =X\n\nTo solve, plug in X = 2Y^3", "answer": " 3"}

He also pays for a cell phone bill for $5 a week. Alex buys a used computer for $80. Alex saves up for a new laptop for $600 that costs 10% of a new cell phone bill per week. Alex gives 20% of a new laptop bill to a charity. What did Alex buy that costs $250?\n\n### Demostrate\n\nInput: We can figure out the order of the transactions using a table that has 4 rows.\n\nRow 1 Alex gets paid $55\nRow 2 Alex pays for a cell phone (55) and then gives 5% as a tithe.\nRow 3 Alex buys a used laptop (80), buys a new phone (5) and then gives the first 5% as a church tithe.\nRow:4 Alex then keeps the rest of his money for a new laptop (515).\n\nOutput: Alex bought a new computer for $50.\n\n### Description\n\nThis explanation follows the table-making strategy described in the instructions. Specifically, the table captures the weekly income and expenses/savings to determine what each week's balance will be.\nThe first transaction is Alex's salary minus his taxes. The next two transactions are the expenses. The balance of $14 represents the $80 saved from the cell phone purchase and $50 bought from the used laptop purchase, minus the 20% tax. The final transaction is the purchase of the new laptop.\n\nThe response demonstrates the table-making strategy by first introducing the problem with input and then building a table.

The statement 'To make a shed in the backyard, Tom needs...' indicates a need for bricks, but we are missing the type of shed and the need level. For instance, it can be a small shed or it can be a huge one for extra storage.\n2. The provided information indicates that a shed will contain 104 bricks. These bricks need to be 1000 in number. Hence, we must double the amount of bricks by multiplying it.\n3.

I want to freeze them in batches of four so that each shot will take up the same amount of space in the freezer. I will store each shot in a 4 ounce paper cup, so how many cups are left over?\"\n\n### Response\nThe first thing that needs to be done is to identify the number of cups remaining. From this information, it should be easy to answer the question.\n\nAnswer: A 4 ounce paper has a capacity of 4 fluid ounces, therefore each shot will take up 1 ounce of space in the container. Also, each shot of alcohol has a capacity of 1.5 oz, thus each shot when stored using a 4 ounce container will take up half the space in the container. One can take the two numbers and use logic to answer the question. Therefore, 4 shots of alcohol will equal the space of 2 containers of alcohol.\nThus, one can conclude that there will be no cups leftover.\n\n# TODO: Finish by following these prompts.\n\n### Include complete explanations below.

{"text": "To answer this question, one must first determine the total sample size before applying the relevant formula. Since a cleaning company produces two sprays, S1 and S2, each containing differing percentages of germs that are supposedly killed by them, we can observe the percent of germs left by each spray S1 and S2 to find if they overlap in any way.\nThe formula for the intersection between sets of two, as given in this problem, is: (S1\u2229S2) = (S1\u2229S1)/(S1\u2229S1) + (S2\u2229S2)/(S2\u2229S2)\n\n### Step 1: Determine the total sample size\nFrom the problem statement, it is mentioned that there are two sanitize sprays produced by the cleaning company. Since a cleaning product produces two types of sprays, let this number, N, be the number of Germs killed by the two sprays. The Germs would have been originally split into two fractions that were 50% and 25% respectively and a 5% overlap, leaving a total of 100% Germs. This can be represented as A+B+C=100%.\n\n### Step2: Find the sample size of each spray.\nTo \n\n### Step Three: Determine the Total Number of Germs:\nTo find this, we simply have to find the percentage of germs that are killed by each spray. We can do this by determining both the fractions and the overlap separately. The fraction of Germs killed by Spray 1 is 0.5 and it kills 5% of the Germs. Therefore, Spray1 killed (0.5).05 Germs. Spray 2 kills 0.25 Germs and kills 5% Germs. Therefore Spray2 kills (0.25).05 Germ \n\n### Formula to find the intersection between sets of 2\nThe formula for the difference between sets of two is: ( S1\u2229S2 ) = ( S1\u2229S1 ) / ( S1\u2229S 1) + ( S 2\u2229S2 ) / ( S2\u2229S2 )", "answer": " 30"}

Since their rate of walking is different and also varies in steps taken, their total time does not equal the amount spent on walking.\n\n### Solution: The amount of minutes does not equal the amount they spend in cleaning their rooms.\n\n##\n\n## Feedback Please, take a minute to provide some feedback on these 2 questions\n\nThe response is inaccurate or incomplete\n\nThere is a factual or language error or an inconsistency\n\nThere is a good response that correctly addresses the question\n\nI'm unsure about the response\n\n### Questions\n\nQ1:\n\nWhat grade Math questions do you typically assign your students and what types of writing prompts do you give to your students to help them get started?\n\n### Demos:\n*Q1* Input: What grade Math questions do you commonly assign your pupils? \n\n*Demos* Choices:  A) 2-3 grade level B) 5-6 grade C) 7-8 grade\nRationales: Option A: Math Questions for 2-3 grade - the question is asking about elementary grades which 2-3 grade is more or less similar to in terms of subject matter.

{"text": "Answer: 40\n\n### Instructions:Angela is a chef in New York. She cooks for a hospital. She has made 900 meals. How many times has she made 11 meals?\n### Demonstation:\nInput:\n\n### Response:(47-2)*11 equals 40 which is an increase by 7.\n\n### Rationals:\n1. The initial input is a base input of 8 packages x meals, which means that Angela must deliver 8 packages multiplied by as many meals as she delivers. This is the case because if Angela delivers 40 meals, that is the same number as 8 x 5.\n2. Angela's base amount is thus: 40 packages x 47 meals.\n3. Because Angela delivers 27 packages and meals, her total must divide 27 total packages and meals by the base of 40 packages x meals.\n4. Because 27 divided by 47 equals 0.5615, the remainder of the total amount divided by 47 is 40.\n5. In other words, for each package delivered by Angela, she delivers additional meals to reach the total of 27 packages and 40 meals.\n6. Therefore, there is an extra 27 divided by the extra 40, or, 0, as the remainder.\n7. Therefore, one extra meal is needed if she delivers 27 total packages. This extra meal is because it is multiplied by 40.\n8. In sum, 40 must be multiplied by the whole amount she delivered which is 27. This means the extra amount delivered multiplied by 47 is to be divided by 40 which equals 40 divided by 47,or, 0.5623. Therefore, when 0.56 is multiplied by 2,or, 1.1202,then the extra meal is obtained.\n9. Therefore, Angela delivers 1 meal,plus, 40 in total.\n10. To reach her total of having to deliver 40 out of 40 of the packages, Angela", "answer": " 3"}

In other words, the only pansy is the one that cost $2.50 and its purchase price was $3.\n\n3)For the hydrangea flower, the puchase price is $12.5, the discount is 10%, and its price is $11.25. Then, the purchased amount is 1 because only 1 hydrangea was bought. \n\n4)Similarly, for the petunia flowers, the purchase price is $1, the discount is also 10%, and the number of purchased petunias is 5 because 5 petunias were purchased. \n\n5)Following this pattern, the amounts that should be added up are [1, $11.2, $2.5]; these amounts are added up to come up with $17.2.\n\n6)The answer would then be $4.8, which gives us $52.00 after 1 is added to get to an even number.\nAnswer: $2.5 x 5= $12.5 (+10%)= $11.2 x 1= $11.20 + $2.5 x5= $17.2 + $50 total. \n\nThe answer is $51.80.", "answer": " 23"}

{"text": "### The answer should be 35 minutes and the students should be shown exactly how they have calculated this solution.\n\nGiven time, distance ran, and time ran for each day of the week with no breaks on Monday, the answer should be 1 hour on that day.\nGiven the time ran for each day and the distance ran on Monday. The answer should be 0.0 hours since Rosie ran for the entire hour on Monday.\nThe difference in distances run between Monday and Tuesday can be calculated and should be 5 miles.\n5 miles/5/hour is equal to 1 hour. Hence, Rosie was done running for the day on Tuesday since she covered a total of 5 miles.\nThe answer should be 0/1 since Rosie did not run for the day Tuesday.\nRepeating the process, the difference in distances run between Tuesday and Wednesday can be calculated and will be equal to 0.5 miles. Therefore, Rosie only ran 0.5 miles at the total day's distance of 5 miles. Hence, Rosie is done running for the day since she ran a total of 6 miles, and the answer should be 2 hours for Rosie's workload for the day.\nThe difference in distance run between Wednesday and Thursday is equal to 1 mile. Therefore, Rosie ran a total of 7 miles for both days. Since Thursday's distance ran is equal to the total distance of 20 miles for Rosie, the answer should be Rosie running for 20 minutes to finish the race.\nThe difference in time ran on Thursday and Friday is equal to 2/20. Rosie ran for 3 hours every day and hence Rosie is left with remaining time to run. However, Rosie ran more than 2 hours for the previous 4 times; Rosie can run 0.5 hours, and she is done running for the week.\nHence, Rosie ran for 0.5/6 + 0/1 = 35 minutes, and the answer will be 35 minutes.\n\n### Input:\"14809992 + a = 8148\" A = 14899813\n\n### Demo:\nInput: 1480", "answer": " 30"}

D) He can walk 44 feet per minute. E) He can walk 55 feet per minute.\n2. If he's walking 11.5 ft/min, that's about 15ft/1min. I assume it's not the same, because in the question it says he \"walked through every row\". If it was 5.5 miles per minute, that would be more than 15 mins.\n\n3. Assuming that Nate had to walk past every row, then we have to count the total number of cars and the number of rows. First we have to count the number of rows, lets take section G, where there are 15 parking rows: 10,20,30,..,150. Now let's count how many parking rows there are in section H, we have: 9,18,27,..,108. We have 110 cars in total and we have to pass 2 parking rows more in section H. Since we don't know the size of each car, let's assume big cars.\n\n4. Now we have: 1,020,060 square feet in total. The area of a square parking lot is a bit more complicated, especially with different sizes of cars, we just multiply the parking spaces by the area of one car space: 2,240,120 sqft.\n\n5. Time required is equal to work divided by the effort. Let's find the total number of meters he walked. To do this, we have to multiply each parking space by the average time it took him to pass it.

{"text": "$105,120\n\n### Instructions:\n* Explain why your response is correct.  You may show your work for this problem.\n* What would your response have been if the price of the barn was $80 per sq ft instead of $98 per sq ft?\n\n# Explanation:\nThe first step in solving this question is to convert the dimensions from sq ft to feet because that is the unit used in the price ($80/square foot). Using the $98 home price and dividing by 98 = 1.0 you obtain the square foot dimension of the home which is 484.2 feet. Now taking the square foot dimension of your home and adding the square foot dimension of  the barn which is 486 feet yields 970 feet overall. The price of the home then becomes: 970 * 80 = $78520.\nThe answer to this question is $7852 which is less than the home price which is why I would be wrong for entering an answer of 78520 even though it follows the same math.\nI made a mistake in this question when I converted the price of barn to a feet measurement by dividing instead of multiplying the $98 price by 1 feet. When I was converting this barn price, I divided instead of multiplied by 98 which gave me the wrong dimension of 483 ft. By multiplying instead of dividing 486 by 98 you arrive at 480, which makes sense because the barn dimension did not change.\n# Explanation for Question 2\n\nThe price of the house is $105,110 and the price of the bar is $3,110. Dividing the price of the house by the price of the bar gives you (105,1010 / 3110) = 3.3999999 recurring (known as a repeating decimal). Rounded that 3.39888888 and multiplies that by the square footage of each room. The price of the house is then 3.39 * 484.86 gives you $1616016. Add the barn to that,", "answer": " 333200"}

{"text": "1.4 dollars.\n\n### Input and Explanation:\nThe question can be considered as asking for the average cost of each book. The sentence 'on average, how much did they cost', is asking for what? Choice:  A: the number of books he bought B: the number of dollars remaining C: the total cost of the books D: the sum of the book prices E: the cost of each individual book\nRationales: Given the information given, all the options are plausible answers.\n1. The number of books they bought, or option A, can be chosen to compute the average cost.\n2. Alternatively, the total cost of the items, or option D, can also be computed with the information available.\n3. The cost of each individual book, or option E, is also an answer option, however it excludes the amount of money he started with which limits his purchase options only to the remaining money, hence disregarding his initial funding.\n4. The option C: the number of dollars left does not make sense because the amount of money left is not related to the number of books he purchased.\n 5. Likewise, option B: the number of remaining dollars is also not an appropriate choice since it isn't a representation of the average cost of each item he purchased.\n6. Hence, all the options are viable answers.\n\n### Solution:\nThe answer is 1.4 dollars, which can be calculated as follows. 'x' is simply a variable representing the price.\n\nThe formula used for finding the average is:\n\n* $TotalCost / $NumberOfItems = AvgCost\n\nThus, the formula that can be used for this problem is:\n\n* ($236 + $236) / 6 = $14\n\nRe-writing:\n\n* $14 = $46x / 6\n\nWe can divide both sides by $46 for easier calculation:\n\n* 0.3355555 = x\n\nNow, we can calculate the rounded average from the decimal: (Rounded Average) = ($0.336 / 0.25)\n\n* Rounded Average = $1.4\n\nHence, the average cost of each individual book is $1.4.\n\n### Difficulty", "answer": " 37"}

A solution in pseudo-code format is presented below:\n```\nfunction solution(boxes)\n    if boxes == 0 then return 0\n    return boxes/2 //1/2 of original boxes given away\n```\n\n### Rationales: 1.`boxes==0` is not a reasonable starting point as it would assume the remaining boxes are all null, which is a false premise.\n2. The first part of the original question asks us how many boxes Seth has left. This could be understood as half of the original number or the number after he gave it away, leaving only the final amount left. Thus, we can disregard a part (1) to the function as it is not relevant to the problem.\n3. Once we determine the condition for determining the remaining amount of boxes, we then multiply that by the conditional statement, that is, `Boxes - Number given`, which is represented via the formula given.\n4. Finally, we need to divide half of the initial number by two, which is accomplished by dividing the number by 2.

{"text": "Write a response that appropriatelly completes the question.\n\n## Answer:\nCarl has a jar filled with marbles. So, The amount of marbles he has in total will not change throughout the game. When Carl picks out more marbles, it will not leave any space in the jar. When he loses marbles and then picks out more marbels, the amount of marbles left will still be the same amount before the game started.\n\nThus, after the game is complete, he will have as many marbles in his jar as when he started, which is 37 in total. The jar will have 37 marbles. \nNow, his mother comes home with a new jar full of marbles, and it contains 25 marbles. So, after the game, the jar will have 62 marbles of which Carl's original marbles were 37 and his mother's 11. They have a total of 48 marbles but Carl will put in 37 instead of 48, because even though his original jar has 37 marbles, he lost half of them and thus needs only 18 marbles to fill in his original jar. But there are no marbles left in the jar (25 + 18) so, when he is put some back they would not be able to fit, even though there is space in the jar to fit them.\n\nThe container is full up to around the '25' mark.\n\nSo, Carl will put back 18 marbles, which leaves room of around the '20' mark.\n\nTherefore, Carl can just continue from the '37' mark.\n\nCarl will put back 37 as his original amount of marbles, which is just a slight overlapping for where the 25 marble mark was.\nBut, the container is full up to the '37' and '62' mark.\n\nThus by putting back 37, Carl's original 37 mark is just covered by the container which has 37 marble marks, but he can not place anything more than 37 in his jar, so Carl will have 37 in total marbles once the game is complete.\n\nCarl can not place anything more in the jar, so he leaves it as it is.", "answer": " 41"}

The total sales will be the total price we paid for bakery products less the cost of the ingredients required for making it.\n\n* The total cost we paid for baking, bakery products, would be,\n\n* 20 X $1.50 + 10 X 3 = $55.00\n\n* This shows that the bakery products will cost $55.043, but since a small fraction of cent makes no difference, we can round it to $55.05.\n\n* The price of the products is $1.50 for cupcakes, $2 for cookies, and $1 per packet for biscuit, and therefore, the cost of all the bakery products is,\n\n* 5 X 1.50 +5X2+4X1=8.50 + 7 +1=16.5\n\n* Adding the bakery products to the cost of the ingedients will give us 55.05 + 16.5 = $71.55.\n\n* Now, the profit would be $71.50-$50 = $21.5\n\n2. b) In a week we can buy ten products of each kind, twenty cupcakes, fifteen cookies and twenty-five packets of biscuits and five of each type in other week.\n\n* The cost of ingredients will be 10*(1.50) + 5  (2) + 10(1) = 16.5 + 2.5 + 10 = 19.00\n\n6)Now, the profit will be 16.5- 20 - 50 = 10.5\n\n3. c) In a bakery, there might be 3 packaging materials which consist of 300", "answer": " 350"}

And he will have 5 of these cracked sandwiches a night. There are 4 sleeves per box then all we do is multiply.\n```\nExplation:\n5 nights would be 5*28 (crackers) = 140 crackers in one box; 5 boxes would give him 700 crackers; 700 cracked sandwiches x 2 crackers with 28 is 61,000 cracked sandwise per 60 nights, so he would have to consume this much peanut buter to last him 60 nights. This would be 61,028 crackers in all.\n\n#### Exact answer:\n61,024 crackers: 5 boxes for 60 days (2 nights per day) equals 300 crackers for each night; 300 cracked sandwishes x 2 crackers = 600 cracked sandwithces per day = 12,000 crackers for 60 days.

And only 16 gallons are needed, which is much less than what basketball water can be if the net were filled.

This makes it quite\ndifficult to work out the answer, and I can find only one way I\u2019d count it: I\u2019d have to take the information\nabout national news, add those five minutes to the remainder.

This again takes some work as advertisements are not specified apart from a total\nnumber of minutes, but that\u2019s the only viable solution. It turns out that to count the number of\nadvertisement minutes from the other information you must subtract the advertisements, since the\ntime without any advertisements is then the time with advertisements. This can be done by working out\nthat the time without advertisements has 12 minutes of advertisements subtracted, which gives 22\nminutes of advertisements.

Thus our answer is E.\n\nAnswer: E: pine trees are also called evergreen needles.\n\n### Input :Write a math equation for the situation.\n\n### Direction: Complete the response.\n\n### Firstly, we need to combine C and D since C is about subtracting 5 from 20 and D is about subtracting -4 from -5.\n\n### Next, combine G and H. Since G is about dividing 25 by a number that is not in the question, H must be the other option. It's about the division of 5 by -17 which is, therefore, H.\n\n### Finally, the missing number between 25 and the sum of 5 and -4 is -18.

The teacher did **not** simply want the answer to the question. Instead, they wanted to know that their student was able to read, interpret and explain the problem in their own words.\n2. As per the given example, we can determine that the total number of members in the club is 30.\n3. One-third of 30 represents 9, which means that there are 9 members who ordered mango juice.\n4. The rest of those members ordered orange juice, which means that the total number of people ordering orange juice would be 30 \u2013 9, which is equal to 21.\n5. Hence, the correct answer to the question is 21.\n\n### Answer the question by providing your own answer.

I find it hard to refute this since they haven't gotten anywhere with their essays in 2 hours and they haven't finished it in their homework time.\n\nAnswer: I think refuting Mrs. Miller's complaint and trying to prove she is wrong or the statement is wrong.\n\nAnswer: A refutation is used to disprove a statement or opinion.\n\n### Refutation:\n**Explanation:** 1. The answer provided can be refuted using multiple logical fallacies, including the \"appeal to ignorance\" logical fallacy.\n2. Mrs. Miller's statement, \"I'm surprised,\" implies her assumption of Bobby's essay's completion.\n3. Bobby's answer seems to directly contradict that assumption, which can be refuted by suggesting that the statement, \"I've only gotten to page 20,\" does not necessarily mean \"I am not able to complete my essay within the given time frame,\" which is the logical conclusion of Mrs. Miller's initial statement.\n4.

{"text": "The first step in solving such an equation is to identify the given values in the problem. In this case, 5 laps around Ian's apartment complex equals 500 feet.\n\nThe second step is to determine how to find the change in weight over time. According to the provided information, 100 feet equals one lap and 100 laps is how many miles will he go at one lap.\nThe third step is to determine how many calories were burned during a jogging session. According to the given information, each jog burns the equivalent of 25 calories per hundred feet. Therefore, Ian burns 100 calories during a jogging session as per one mile.\n\nTo arrive at an answer, we subtract 25 calories by 5 (5 laps), which amounts to a calorie burn of 125.\n\nIan's cumulative calorie burn is 125 + 125 +125 + 25 + 100, which amounts to 380 calories.\n\nIan is 200 pounds, we subtract 150 pounds from 380 to obtain a net change of 130 calories.\nAnswer:Ian has a net weight loss of 130 pounds.\n\n### Input 1: What is the average cost per hour for an appliance repairing company? (Average cost per hour will be found by finding the average value of the costs of two repairing companies)\nInput 2: How many hours did Appliance Repair Company A operate per week? (One week is 7 days)\nInput 3: How many days did Appliance Repair Co B operate for in the same week? (One week = 7 days)\n\nAnswer: Appliance Repair Company B was the more expensive to hire for a repair job. However, one must weigh cost against time, the longer the cost will take for the job to be complete. Appliance Repair Company is more expensive, but it operates on less hours which can reduce waiting times as well. Therefore, the most rational decision would be to hire Appliance Repair Company if one had enough waiting time because the cheaper company may cause longer waiting times for the job to be done.\n\n### How much money did Mary Jane sell 3 boxes", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "I will use linear combination method to solve this problem. Emily knows that the 5-day minimum average is equal to Monday through Thrusday combined. And she knows that Thrusday's rain level is 1 inch. That leaves 4 other days that must add up to the 5 - Thrusday's value. So, 1 inch + 2 inch + (2 - 1 =) 3 inches. Therefore, the 5 day average is 2 1/3 inches.\n\n### Explanation:In this question, we're given a sequence of numbers that are in the context of a week. The week in question has 5 days, Monday and Tuesday do not rain, and the 4 remaining days do. We're informed that Monday through Thursday rained 2 inches each day, and the Friday had 1 inch. We're given the equation for the 5 day minimum average, and we are given the value of Thursday by itself. This means that we are given the total 6 days' worth of rain, and we are given a value for one of those days. This means we are able to subtract. Therefore, we're told to find out what the average is for all five days of rain, and since we are given a value that we can subtract, use the linear combination method. This method would use the given equation and subtract the given value.\n\n### Extension:Using this method, if we were given that Thrusday'emily saw that it rained the full amount that it rained daily 7 times. That makes the 5 day minimum equal to 11. And since the given value for Thursday was 1 inch, subtract that from the 11, resulting in 10. Therefore, the 8 day average is 1 1/2 inches. This is an extension of the problem given.\n\n### Input : 3540-6594-1526+2891=?\n\n### Response : 5655\n\n### Explain:\n\n### Input 3 : +2346-8873-9969 =?\n\nAnswer: -3781\n\n\n### Input I:\n\nI need to get 700% of", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "We should first divide the number of red candles and the blue candles into two ratios. The red candles have a ratio of 5: 3, while blue candles have a ratio that is yet to be determined. So to solve this problem we need that ratio of blue to be found by first dividing 45, which is the number of red candlesthrough that ratio. To get this ratio, simply we take 45 and divide it by 3, which leaves us with a new ratio for the red and blue candles of 15:2. We need to have our original ratio of 5:4 of the blue candles to the original ratio of 5 : 3 of the red candles. After doing that we got the 2: 3 ratio. So, Avianna bought blue candles in the ration of 2:3.\n### Rational:In the first step our answer should be the one that is closest to the correct answer. The second step to solving the question is that we need to determine the ratio fo 45(red) to 15(blue). But before we determine that ratio, we don't want to determine the number of blue candles and red candles. Instead, we want to determine the ratio of blue candles to red candles. Doing this gets us our blue candles and our blue candles to go in our first step. After we complete the steps and get our first step, we want one that is a fraction. But first we need to transform 23 to the lowest denomination, which is 23/1, so we add all those numbers up for a total of 361/2 (since we have a denominator).

{"text": "Input: Why is option C: A number between 4 and 5 excluded? Answer: If the ball flies and hits the ground after 8 seconds, then it will continue to fly for an extra _X_ seconds and the border collie will continue to run after it for _X_ seconds. By using the information that Belinda can throw a ball 20 ft/second, we can conclude that the speed of the ball is 20 ft/s. If the ball hits the ground within 8 seconds, then the time that its in the air will be _(8-20)s_ and the border collie running after it will be an extra _X_. Now to calculate _X_, we need only find the time, _T_, after which Belinda has thrown the ball and it has hit the ground.\n1. We know Belinda has thrown the _10 + T_ seconds before it hits the ground.\n2. Therefore, the speed of the ball before it hits the ground = 20 ft/sec\n3. We can find the speed of the ball after it hits the ground by subtracting the time taken to hit the ground from the total time, which means we are only interested in the acceleration of the ball when and where it hits the ground. Thus, we are only interested in velocity of the ball after it has hit the ground and not during flight, which is 0 ft/sec.\n4. So, the velocity of the ball when it hts the ground = (20ft/s) - (8ft/s) = 12 ft/s\n5. As stated earlier, the dog running after the fastest catches up after X seconds. This means the speed of the dog must be 12 ft/sec at most to catch the ball. Let us call this speed, u.\n\n1. We can formulate an equation of the following equation,\n2. S = u + v = x\n3. Therefore,\n5. Now, by plugging values in for Belinda's speed, _u_ = 20 ft, velocity of ball, v = 12 ft and _T_ = 8 seconds, the equation turns into _= 12 + 12 = 24_.\n6. This means the ball will hit the ground after _4 x_ seconds, or _8 + 8 = 1", "answer": " 32"}

If that were true, it means that Ben, Billy and John had to split the remaining 100ft fence among themselves (100/3 = 33 ft each). So by the time Ben and Johnny had each whitewashed a fifth, they should already have done 33 + 15 + 15 = 63 ft of fence. However, as we know from the problem, there's only 35 ft remaining. 3) option D is a possible answer. It specifies that out of the 105 ft of fence that is still left to whitewash, Tom has whitewashed 15 ft and his friends a total of 55 ft. This means there's still 55 - 15 ft / 55 ft remaining, so B is the correct answer.

{"text": "- Input: Brendan can cut  yd a day, he bought a mower that helped the cut more grass by %. If Brendan cuts grass for a week how many acres will Brendan be a after a week?\n- Demonstration:The goal of this question is to determine how many acres Brendan is a after a week of grass cutting. To determine this, we first need to translate the input statement into a formula. Based on the information given in the input statement, the formula would be: yd/day x 50%=ac per day Brendan has 8y/day so his will be 8y*8x50%=ac/day. In order to determine the amount after a week, we multiple this value by 7 and divide it by 7 as there are 7 days in a week.

If those are our only 2 known pieces of data, it is impossible to determine how many cows drown. There are many different possibilities of how many cows could drown (0 cows could drown, 2 cows, 3, 16, 13 cows, etc).\n\nHowever, we know that all 14 dogs survived. Taking this data along with the rest, we can infer that cows drowned double that of the sheep, because 14 dogs surived a 10+-cow loss. So, 11 cows drowned. The total of dogs plus sheep equals 21, so we know that 20 sheep (which we already know) plus the newly found out 11 cows (from 20-14=6 which equals 11 of the cows survived).

To answer this question, we can first identify the base 150 cal of sugar, then we subtract 150 from the 2500.\n2. If we can determine that person X consumed 2500 units of sugar, then this gives us 500 as the remaining amount that is not 150 cals, which can be equated to 350 cents (2500/500). 350 cts can be converted into 13 grams by multiplying each ct by 1/150.\n3. 13 gm. / 5% = 3 cts. / 25 cts. (gm. /%. value)\n\n4. Now, person X ate bars of candy with an average of 25 (assuming each cnt. were equal) Cals. of added sugar, which is converted to a gm. value due to the 150 cal / 5% limit.\n\n5. These 100 grams of added sugar are consumed with the already-set 3 grams limit.\n\n6. Then person X must have consumed 13 grams of added sugar for 3 cents at first, and 100 grms. on top for 13 grams.

Therefore, a Socratic Seminary has a lot of people explaining each other and themselves how to do a problem.\n4.Also, in my class, when we are working on a problem, we don't want the students to simply give up. We want them to keep working on it and figure it out.\n\n### Response\nSince I was stumped on the problem, if you are also stuck on the problem I would recommend looking for the common denominator.

{"text": "The solution to this question begins with the following formula: `Let n = the total number of birds (in the cage).` After 10 minutes, when half of the birds leave the cage, the number of birds that remained is: `2n - n^2 = 40 - (40^2 - 40) = 40 - 1600 = 1560`.\nRationales: The answer key for this question can be found [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/wh/great-number-stories/v/cage-of-birds-with-hypothesis-test/e/cage-of_birds_with_hypothesis_test?_sm_a=iVVR7dWX3w1JxDW3jKwK_EKNjZ12-2XHBhVk_LrUbkM.\n\n### Input\nWhich is the larger number, 2.23 or 2.24 Choices: A: 2.24 B: 2.23\nRationales:\nThe larger number can be determined by comparing their significants:\n2.2 = 2.23.\nTo compare 2.23 and 2.24, we take the decimal to the right of the decimal:\n2.23 = 2\u00b7(0.01) and 2.2 = 0.2\nHence, 2.24 is the larger number.\nAnswer: B: 2.33\n\n### Input : The formula for the circumference of a circle is the measure of the distance around the circle - and that's where Pi comes in... 3.14. For a circle with a diameter of 5 centimeters, the diameter of the circle is\nRationales: We have to write the formula for the circumference and we know that Pi is 3.14, so we know that the formula is Pi\u00b7r.\nAnd then we can write the formula for circumference as follows:\n\u03c0r\nWe substitute 3.14 for \u03c0 and 5 for r to get the answer.

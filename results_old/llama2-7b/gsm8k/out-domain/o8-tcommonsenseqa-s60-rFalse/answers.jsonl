After the second amount of jelly beans are added to the box I multiply them again by 3 after subtraction to get the number to use to calculate.

{"text": "This is a simple question using multiple numbers. I would type: `1,307`. \n\n### Input\n\n####  The teacher also wants the students to explain why they use the method of addition and subtraction\n```plain\nThe question asks the students to explain the methods which are adding and subtracting. The most common methods to calculate a fraction are: multiply the numerator (top of the fraction) by the denominator (bottom of the fraction), divide the numerator by the denominator or add a whole number number to the denominator. The numerator is always number of parts you have and denominator is the total amount of parts in a fraction. In this example, the problem asks to write the answer of subtract the numerator and denominator so the answer would be 4. The students would say that they subtracted the numerator from the denominator to figure out the answer.\n```\n####  If the result of a calculation is not equal to the answer, what might be the reasoning?\n```\nAs part of the grade, the student has to explain why the result is given or not given, if it\u2019s not equal to the answer. This is a very logical question that the student needs to provide the reasoning or explanation why it is not equal to the actual answer.\n```\n\n### Instructions:\n```plain\nIn this question, the teacher also wants the students explaining why they need to add or subtract. The students would not be guessing and needing to write a guess down hoping that is answer is correct. They know that they need to perform an addition or subtraction. The students would explain that it is either an addition of what, or subtract from the bottom to answer the problem.\n```\n### Instruction Demonstration: \n```plain\nFor a fraction, the problem wants the students to write 7 + \u00bd. This is an addition problem which means that they need to add 7 to \u00bd. The answer would be 7 \u00bd.\n```\n## #Addition\n```\n### Demonstraiton: \nAddition is one of the most important mathematical operations one can ever learn. Adding numbers together helps you know how many of the number you are adding together to make.\n```\n## Mathematical Processes \nThe three processes are addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

{"text": "Conner can ride his dune buggy at an average speed of 56 miles per hour.\n\n### Explanation:\nWhen going flat on sand the dune buggy can ride at a speed equal to 10, when going downhill it speed will increase by 43, and when riding uphill it speeds will decrease by 20.  We know Conner has traveled 1/3 of the time on flat, 1/3 of time uphill, and 1/3 of  time downhill.  So after adding that all up we come up with 6/3.  We know that our dune buggy can travel flat at 10, downhill at 143, and uphill at 60. We combine the two to make his average speed when going downhill equal 6/9.  After going up a hill we know he will go down again after going up to go down the same amount he went up.  We use this and set our 1/9 on uphill equal to 1/9 on downhill.  The second 1/9 of up equals his time on a flat ground.  Now we plug it all in we get our answer of 6/9 multiplied by 5/6.  We know 5/6 is 5 over 6 not 1/6.  We use this fact to move the denominator to be 5. We multiply both our fractions by getting 5 on the denominator of our fraction when we move the 5 we divide the numerator by 5.  After doing this we can multiple the new fraction by all our other fractions and we get 19+4/6.

Because we're subtracting from that amount, it makes the value an inverse operation, which is division. We also want to have a common denominator, which means we'll be dividing by the same unit as the base. For this, we'll divide by 5 (i.e. the remainder after we removed a 5 from our money amount). What does that give us? Well, we only had 5 digits of our number, so that means our quotient will be our original amount divided by 5.

You drive at an even 40 mph during the entire road trip. If you start from point A and end up back at point A, how far have you traveled?\n\n### Process: There are 10 miles traveling from point A to B.  You would then be traveling back to point A at a rate of 40 mph. 40 mph is the same as 1 hour. How long does it take to drive the entire trip back?\n\n### Problemsolving: There is a 20 mile road trip. Distance from A to C + Distance from B to A, and divide by two gives you the distance between B and C. Distance between A and C = 10 miles Distance between B and A = 10 miles Divided by two = 5 miles\n\n### Problem3: How long does it take the car to drive 80 miles at 60 mph when given the distance and the speed is known?\n\n### Solution: Given a speed of 60 miles per hour, the time taken to drive at the given speed is 1 hour. Multiplying the 1-hour time by 60, the product is 60 miles per minute. From the 80 miles given, 60 miles is required to be travelled in one hour, therefore multiplying the 80 distance by 60 gives you 4800 miles per minute, or 80 miles per minute in order to reach the distance covered during the time given.\n\n### Proof: Given a speed of (60 mph), the 80 miles is not enough to get the distance covered in 1 hour. If we were to increase by 1 for every hour, we would drive 84 miles instead of 80 miles by the time we drive for another hour.\n\n### Problem4: There was a 400 mile road trip.

{"text": "I'll use these choices as they are in the problem. To solve this problem for a distance of 1 mile I'll use the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nAnswer: The Pythagorean Theorem is a2+b2 = c2 (a2, b2, c2 being distances). Since the question asks for 1 mile, we will express the distance in units of yards. Then the equation changes to 4a + 2b = 16.\n\nNow all we need is the length of each light, so that we can perform this equation. We know that Veronica's light will be three times as far. So we get 4x(3x) + 2x = 16x. Now add 2x to the right side and subtract three times 4x from the left side. We then get (9x + 2) - (4 x 3x) = 16x + 2 - 12 x3. We then get (7x + 2) = 16. The last step is to solve for x, which we do by using the properties of exponents. (7)(x + 1) = 16 then we solve for x which is 1.64 or about 1.65 miles apart. Veronica's light can be seen from a distance of 5.13 miles, and Velma'll light can be seen from about 3.3 miles away.\n\n### Input;Solve for x\n\n### Answer:x/2\n\n### Instructions:Solve for x.\nAnswer:32 - x\nQuestion:\nWhat math formula is shown?\nSolve for x^2.\n\nInput:The formula is 1.5x^2.\n\n### Response;\n\nI am going to use a formula that is easier to read to solve for x:\nThe formula is 10x -5x^2. We can take out any x since it is inside the sqaures, and the 5x^2 is a binomial. \nWe then get 5x^2 -10x + x^2. We first do 10x by taking it out.

If the answer is 4, it'll tell the answerer to use 2 and 3, if it is 8, use 4 and 5. The reason for this is that a bull only has 12 legs, so anything above that is a \"really big bull\" but under it can still be a \"huge bull\".

{"text": "You are creating a mathematical relationship called a _proportion_.  You need to know that there are 4 slices in each pack, and 8 slices in total.  We know that in order to get 2 slices, we have to divide by 4 because there are 8/4.  So if we multiply that 8 by 1/4 we get  8 * (1/4) = 2.  If we start with the denominator and move it to the numerator we get 8/4 = 8/2 = 4 slices. This means that it is the same for the second and the third pack of bread.\nThen to get the total, we have to add everything for 1, 2, 3, 4.  For the 5th pack we do 8/4=1/2 =  1 slice and for the 6th and 7th we have to divide by the same numerator we divided in the beginning so 8/4 =8/2=4 but we will just add them after we finish 1-8.

So we can do 8h * 2g which will give us 16h which we know will equal to 4 hours for each game.\n\nIf there are 4 hours for each player on each team there will be 4 hours for each individual team and then we have to add that together to get our final answer since it\u2019s 2 hours for every game.

{"text": "Input:During one week, there are 4 trips through the lake per week. The boat can take 12 people during every trip. How many people does the boat transport in 4 weeks?\n\n### Demostration:\n\nWhen I first looked at this question, I was a bit dumbfounded by how hard it would seem to calculate everything. Luckily after I did it, and I understand what I was doing is why I am sharing how I did it.\n\nThe first thing we need to do is make this question into what we are familiar with. When I first read it I wasn't really thinking but just started doing the question. As I started, I realized that I had started doing math that wasn't even in this question. All of this math was just me trying to help figure out what the question was asking. I had thought that this question wants to know how many people were being transported at one point in the day. I then started to figure out the next thing as being how many people were being taken during at each moment. This was a bit difficult. If I was correct with my thought, this would be asking what the peak was at. I would think that is what they wanted to know.\n\nNext, we have to figure out the next step. There are 4 trips per day. This tells us that this question probably wants to know how long it takes to complete the trips. I decided that it makes the most sense to make this into a number that is divisible by time. I chose to make every trip into a day. This meant that the people were being transported for 24 hours each day and 365 people were being transported each year. This is what I thought that they wanted to know. I would assume that this was too low but I felt that I had to put the most faith in my gut.\n\nThe next step was to make sense of the 4 trips per year. To do this, I used a multiplication method for days. 4 times 365 was 1,460. I then added to this for each year. It makes sense to me that they wanted to know how many people per day were being transported. I made this to 100,000. I was not even sure how to answer this question but I tried to work with what I think they were asking in the", "answer": " 96"}

Use the row first (A, B, C \u2026 ) and then the column (or letter) (a, b, c, \u2026.. A, B, C \u2026 ).\n\nWhen you talk about column A, for that you will take the letter A and then the number assigned to the table. The table with the column lettered A is the first table for A.\n\nWhen you refer to row B, row D, etc. be sure your parent, guardian and teacher will know which table you're referring to.\n\n* You can only answer each question in the table once.\n* Make sure to keep your request and instructions straight.\n\n### The letter F\n\nTeachers may wish to give students the letter F and tell the students that each letter F refers to a number they may wish to know, but do not want to say outright. \n\nFor example: Students may be told that they will get the letter F for a F (Fahrenheit), for an F (Frequent) or an F (Free) - if they say outright which it is, they don't get credit for the letter F. Instead they get an F minus 10, or an F minus 20, or whatever the teacher wants to give them for giving up the game. \n\nA good method for teaching letters F to students is to ask students to draw a number, write a number, or come up with a word for the letter F, but you just need to ask. And then write that \"you'll do so after we get home\" to keep them talking to you (which helps with talking to the teacher and answering teacher's questions). \n\nStudents then learn that if you do, you will get the number - and if you don't, you won't. The teacher may even give up teaching F to one student but not the others, and then another student will eventually say \"F\" if", "answer": " 7"}

We can solve the equation for S by squaring each side and performing some algebra until we get this result:\n\n${S=0.4(600.00+250.0+130.00)$\n\nSo then according to the given task, the person's savings will be $88.00+$8,800/20, or $88,800,000 in total for the year.", "answer": " 460"}

This problem must be calculated by a calculator.\nResponse:The initial probability of the player making the All Star Team would be 1-P, where P is the chance of none of the players reaching the All Star Team. To find P, we use the given information to find out the total number of players who will make the All Star Team. Then we can subtract the number of made All Star Players from the amount of the All Star team they could make. Then we can subtract this total from the total possible players this player can make the All Star Team with. This lets us find the minimum chance for each player who would make the All Star team.

R* 2 -2Rahem = 6 6+R = 12. R = 12 - 6 or 12 - Rahim. So, that would be 12 - Rahem is R = 6. Now, Rahim + (6 - Rahim) = 6 R = 12 12 - 12 = 0.\n\n### Input:-9 is more than -19.

{"text": "Jackson pays 2400 dollars\n\n### Explanation:Because there are 4 quarts to 1 gallon, each gallon can be replaced with 4 quarts. This can then be replaced by 8 bottles. The cost of the bottles is 1200. The 20% discount on the 1200 is a reduction of 240, which gets subtracted from the 120 to give the final answer of 960. However, Jackson will buy 8 bottles and not 40 so the final answer is 3600. The 3600 can be broken down to 900 for a bottle. There are 8 bottles, so 900 x 8 = 7200. The difference is therefore 3200 because this is the change in dollar amount.\n\n### Input\nWrite a program that calculates how long it will take to reach the moon by using the gravitational constant given below.

{"text": "We need to determine the present age of the brother. The brother's present age can be represented by the variable b. From the question, we know that **b** is twice what the speaker believes to be their age. Therefore, ***b = 2 (age/10)*10=2*(age/10) = 2age/10*** because it doesn't matter if we multiply 10 to the left or the right because the result would still be the same. Now, we have to convert 2age/1 + 2age/1 into **2a** and then find the sum. From the question, the speaker knows that the sum of age+age will be 45, but they know their ages are 1 more than equal 2. We can solve this by finding **S = (age + age/1)*(1/1+2) = (age)*(1-2/1) = (age) - age = age - age = 0 (remember to subtract from each side the same amount on each side, and each side will be equal to 0).

If the architect plans to construct the house using twice as many building materials and charging $600 for the construction, how much money will the architect make?\n\n### Demostration:\nAnswer: The cost will be increased double which is $2. So $800*2= $1600. Because the architect will charge $600, then it means he will make a profit of $600-$1600= $-1000. Thus the architect will lose $1000.\n\n### Input : A box of toothpics contains 450, how many box will have a model\n\n### Solution:\nWe first know that every card used 75 toofpics, so:\n1- Card 1 used toofpic = 450/52 = 8.75\n2- Card 2 used toofpic = (450/51)*2 = 9\n3- Card 3 used toofpic = [(450/50)*2]*2 = 12\nIt is clear from above that no card uses more than 12 toofpics, now as card no. 1 and 52 and as all cards other than card 1 use 75 toofpic each, we need to know what to do from card 1 since we have 53 cards. So, I decided to make a house with 75 toofpin on card 1, 75 toofpick on card 2 and 75 toofpike on card 52, 135 toofpic on 52-1 cards and this means:\n450/ 52 * (1-52) = 75 + 75 + 1235 = 1475 and it means that there are enough toofpick for all cards and that is what I needed, hope its clear to you now :)", "answer": " 6"}

When each page is printed and each page is crumpled and blurred, the total pages is 26 plus the total crumplings is 26 plus every third page is blured, 4. 26 + 4 + 10 = 40. \nSo, how do I know if a page is crushed? Because it prints and blurs. 57 prints with blur in the same number means 534 is not crushed and 26 are crumpled.\n\n### Credit for Solution:\nThanks to [Abraham Lopez](https://github.com/arllope)", "answer": " 24"}
{"text": "This can be done by placing the equation: F=mL (212-293)/433, and plugging the variables into the equation. You will get F=0.9892383 and multiply this by the density. You can get the density by using this formula for a gallon of water: 10 lbs/(3.785 gallons). You get, W=2.7344659lbs/gallon. The volume for 10 gal is:10(4.2)=42gallon. Your last step is solving F/1.985=42, which would give you F= 20.16. The answer would be: 20.17 = 10 trips.", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "#### Solution for Ittymangnalk\n\nIttymangnalk eats the fish that Ittymaanak is suppose to eat because he thinks that he is not getting his fair share.  Ittymaanak gives up his share and decides to go out and hunt more fish.\n\nHowever, Ittymaanak hunts even more fish that he doesn't share with anybody.  Ittymaank gives up his share and goes to try and hunt for even more fish.  Iittymangank goes to hunt more fish than he need to eat and in the process gives Oomyapeck more pieces of fish than are actually there.\n\nThe conclusion to this is that there will be no more fish for Ittymaanak, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck because Iittymangak gave up all of the fish to go get more.\n\n#### Solution for Kingnook\n\nKingnook eats all of the fish that she is supposed to eat because she thinks that Ittymaank is always going to give more fish to Oomyapeck then he says he will.  Kingnook gives up her share and decides to do the same thing as Ittymaank and hunt more fish and give it to him to eat.\n\nAfter this Kingnook then thinks that Ittymaanik will give Oomyapek more fish than is actually there.  Kingnook goes to get more fish than she will eat and Ittymaanik is suppose to eat and gives more to Oomyapek.\n\nTherefore, Ittymangak gave up his share which was all of the fish which didn't have any eyes to give to Oomyapekt then gave up all of the rest of the fish which was suppose to go to Ittymaank.  Kingnook gave up all of her fish which was suppose to have gone to Ittymaack also which led to  nobody actually getting the fish after Oomyapeck gots his 22 eyes.", "answer": " 4"}

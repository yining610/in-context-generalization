{"text": "If they divide the total strawberries evenly, there would be 45 strawberries for Kimberly. Her brother picked about 48 strawberries, which is double what her parents picked and triple what she picked! Let's find how many strawberies Kimberly picked.

{"text": "If $80 divided by 5 equals 16, $16 is 1/5 of 80. So the $80 are split into two groups. 3/5 is the cash sales and 2/5 is the credit sales. So Mr. Brandon made $16 cash sales plus the rest of the credit sales of $20. The answer is $16 + 20 =$36.\n\nThere was some confusion regarding a line in the task, it reads: \"Mr. Brandon's sales were split 2/5 into cash sales and 3/5 into credit sales\". Is it true that, since Mr. Brandon'\u200bs sales were split into 2/5 and 3/5, that 2/5 must be the credit sales while 3/5 is cash sales? If not, is part of the credit sales the cash sales? For example, does a credit sale equal to both the cash amount and the cash equivalent amount and then if the amount of the credit sale is 2/5 of 8o is the actual sales to be 16?  What we feel is true is that the amount of the credit sales is 2/5 and that is what is represented as the credit sales whereas the rest is the cash sales. So does this equate to 16? Or not, since the amount of the cash sales and the amount of the credit is the same? If not, and the amount of the cah sales divided by 5 is 16/5, will it equate to the total sales?  That is, since the $80 are divided into cash sales and credit sales, $16 divided by 5 equals x and then $x plus the remainder equates to the total sales. We are aware that it is possible that the solution is indeed 16, however, it is just that, that is possible. We are still puzzled as to the correct method for division of the cash and credit sales.\n\nThe problem reads: The buyers who came to Mrs. Mossad's shop yesterday bought good worth $80. if 2/5 of all the shops sales in the day were credit sales, and rest of the money was in cash sales, then how much did Mr. Mossad made from the sales?\n\n**1.", "answer": " 48"}

The formula for change in elevation given by s=4m/t to the second power divided by 5 to the second power means that the elevation is proportional to time squared. Time squared is then multiplied by 4 to get the elevator elevation.

In mathematics, if the value of a variable is negative, the sign is different \"the absolute value of a number\", since mathematics is a very technical program.\n\n#### Which steps did you use to answer this question?\n\nThe steps I used to answer this question are:\n\nI subtracted the cost of the necklaces by the total cost (3 polos + 2 necklaces), 1 computer game, and after that, I divided it by the cost of the polos because I've only purchased 5 polos out of the 14 total products the man received.\n\n#### How did you use the rules or patterns in your work?\n\nThe rules/patterns used in my work are the ones learned through elementary school, for example, long division and fractions.\n\n#### How do you determine when you are finished with a procedure or task?\n\nI knew I was finished with the procedure when the total cost for the man's gift was $50.\n\n#### Is there a concept or procedure in mathematics that you had trouble with?

So subtracting 12 minutes (which is minutes per 80 questions at current pace) leaves 28 minutes, or 46 questions not answered, in 56 minutes. \nWhen the exam is over, she will probably not finish at the same rate though: she will likely spend more time on the later quizzes than the earlier ones due to them having less questions. So to get the expected questions total (if the exam was completed instead of having limited time) would be take her 46 questions and add 12 (minutes per 80 questions answered) to get a new total of 58 questions. But she still has to answer the 20 questions she already answered. \nShe will not have to answer 48 questions which leaves 34/60 (or 56.6666...% or.5666, whichever makes you happier) remaining. \nThis would be if, she could answer the exact same 60 questions over and over (instead of stopping at 56).

Thus, six pies are made when added to the six recipes because flour is called for for one ounce in each pie. If all but flour were taken out of the equation, you would only have 42 pieces of pie, but six recipes are needed to make one pie.\n\n### Input : Diane makes bread roll-ups.

The number of grandchildren would be 8 plus 64 which is 72.  There are 2 exceptions, because those two have 5 children rather than 8. So each of those have 5 children so the grandchildren are 72 plus 5 (5=12). 72+12 is 84. 8 plus 84 is 92. Each of the number 72 and 12 can be divided down to 2.

{"text": "15\n\n### Detailed Description:\nFirst we will note that this task is a math question, then consider the information contained within the question.\n\nIn the instructions, above, two phrases may strike you as odd:\n- \t\"Answer the following grade math\" (a \"math question from grade school?\")\n-   \"A person is beginning work\" (who is that?)\nWe will interpret these the following way:\n- \tThe instructions are not to solve a particular problem, instead the instructions contain a set of problems that are representative of math questions you may encounter during your freshman year of highschool.\n\nNow let's consider the question, above, and apply this interpretation:\n```\nJohnny has been playing the guitar for a while now\n```\nWe expect a quantity to be related to time in the question (in this case Johnnys practice time). The question asks about how Johnny got to the current level of practice, so \"has been playing for a while now\" could represent months of time.\n```\n...he practices the same amount each daily\n```\nAgain we have a quantity that is related to time, only we expect a quantity to be the result of some event. To determine this we look at the previous part of the paragraph (The question asks \"how many days will pass before he has 3 times as many practice hours as he does currently\").\n```\nAs of 20 days you currently have half as much practice\n```\nThis could indicate that John's practice time is currently \"half\" that which a different person might have. A good rule of thumb is to consider whether a quantity is likely to be large or small. If it is large then a value of \"half\" indicates a quantity of about 1,500 (rounded) practice hours, which is likely to be a very large quantity of practice hours in real life. If it is small then a value of \"1/2\" indicates some value in the hundreds or less (perhaps dozens).\nWe want to know what amount of practice will cause John to have 3 times as many hours of practice as he did 20 days ago. Note, Johnny's initial practice is not specified but is likely a small quantity of practice time. For most people their practice time is a couple hours per day, with perhaps an additional five hours per week. Therefore we can assume John has about 6", "answer": " 80"}

{"text": "Lucy originally had $25 at the beginning and now she has $520 at the end\n\n### Instructions:You are not looking for grammatical correctness, but rather for a demonstration that you can interpret a sentence and answer the sentence.\n\n### Response Rationale:\nIn math, the statement \"Lucy originally had $5 at the beginning\" is interpreted as the expression \"Lucy originally had 0 + $5\". This can be expressed alternatively as \"$0 + $5 = 0 + Lucy\". As such, \"$Lucy\" in the second sentence is referring to \"Lucy\" defined in the first sentence. The expression \"Lucy originally\" simply expresses the initial value of the first variable \"$L\". The expression \"and now...\" says that there was an action to be completed before the second expression (i.e., Lucy's \"bank account\" was not \"up to date\" at that point). In the second expression, the expression \"now\" expresses the current value of dollar amount $L that is accumulating from the first expression.\n\nThere are many ways that the information could have been presented, but \"Linda\" appears in the question as an entity name. We can only interpret it as the variable \"$L$\", whose value at the beginning is \"0\".", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": "I think the answer is 136.\n#### Reasoning: I chose answer D because the unicorn moves 1 meter per step, so 4 flowers per unicorn, so 4 unicorns and 4 flowers give me 12 flowers. so 12, repeated 11 times, gives me 131 flowers total with 9 kilometres (5.62136 miles) of travel. I then multiply 9 kilometres by 2 which gives me 18 miles. I then take away 18 miles from 12 and I get 4,096 flowers, then I divide 4,099 by 12 and get 341. so the answer was 341 flowers per 12 unicorns. but i rounded up and got 342 flowers\n#### Expected Output: 5.6214 miles per unicorn.\n#### Exceptional Output: 136 flowers\n#### Explanation: The question is pretty simple, the only thing that confused me was the flower multiplier.\n#### Screenshot: \n\n\n\n![](Screenshot from 2021-07-24 08-03-54.png)", "answer": " 72000"}

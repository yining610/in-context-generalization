Choices: \t A: writer\t B: publisher\t C: editor\t D: literary agent\t E: bookstore\nRationales:\t 1. The question presents an issue with certain types of authors. These authors may need to cite or quote material from the content of a novel in order to write about it.\n2. Next, we have to consider which authors need to identify the works of other authors or authors within certain literary works.\n3. There are four types of authors provided to us: A: writer, B: publisher, C: editor, D: literary agent, E: bookstore.\n4. Writers need information and content directly from the novel to write about something. So, option A: writer is most likely to need to cite the contents of the novel.\n5. The other options, B: publisher C: editor, D and E: bookstore, generally don't require that type of content.\n6. Thus, option A: writer would be the best answer.

The person in question can't make money, implying he must feel a sense of unhappiness or lack of profit, either through work or investment.\n2. We first consider the answers between A and B to identify which best matches the sentiment felt by the person.\n3. Feeling guilty is not something that comes to mind when we are discussing feelings of profits and losses, especially not as an outcome.\n4. So we can rule out choice A, which means we can discard option B.\n5. Feeling depressed would be more appropriate, but we can narrow down the choices and ignore A and B because of the above.\n6.

Further, sleeping here might not be a choice since it could be a sign of starvation.

Choice B: hunt for is not viable because there is no reason to believe or assume that this person is able to hunt, as no hunter gear is mentioned in the question. Furthermore, there isn't sufficient supportive evidence that this person is able-bodied or fit enough to hunt efficiently by themselves. \n8.

Both options mean that the person is upset or has low self-esteem. However, feeling humiliated is a more probable outcome. Humiliation would make an individual angry and aggressive, thus lowering their ability to solve the problem and increasing their risk of violence. \n8.

This question asks for the best way one can think of to solve a really big problem.\n(2). The statement implies that the problem is severe and needs to be solved urgently.\n(3). We then examine the choices given to see which of them refers to an action, and which of them is just plain thinking. \n(4).

Everest through what? Choices: Mountainside A: crevices B: rocks C: riverside D: glaciers E: snowy slopes\nRationales: Given that they have to \"find their way to the top\", you can assume that they don't already know the location of the top of Mt Everest, and that they will therefore have to climb to the top. \nFrom this, you can assume that the path of the climb has some obstacles in the way. \nThe \"rocks\" in a mountain are often in the way of a climber's path, so this seems like a logical choice. \nHowever, \"rocks\" does not seem to be the path that needs to be climbed, only an obstacle that gets in the way.  Since the climbers are finding a way to the top, and not up a mountain, \"rocks\" is a poor choice.\nAlso \"crevices\" does not seem to make sense, as they are natural caves in the rock which are not typically a pathway.  Since they do not need to \"find their way up the mountain\", \"rocks' cannot be the choice, but they do need to find their way to the top.  \"Crevices\" is not the right answer.\n\"Mountains' suggests that the pathway is a natural path that is already created, and that climbing up requires no work on the path. \"Creevices\" is similar as it sounds like paths are naturally formed", "answer": " 90"}

Choice B: hunt for some food might not be a good option either, since it implies a need to search far away from the area where they are currently located. In addition, the neolithic people did not yet have the technology and knowledge to hunt.\n8. Therefore, we need to look for an option that involves the most direct and quick action to obtain some food. Option E: prepare to go is the simplest, most direct, and quick solution to the problem.\n9.

From the question, we cannot know what he has been accused of but we can surmise that it has something to do with being the best person.\n3. For the question to correctly refer to the correct person for a job, the person that is being referred to in the question is the same as the person for the job - in other words that the person will be offered the job if they fulfill certain requirements. Because we know that he is already performing a job, it is likely that he already has fulfilled the requirements.\n4.

The question gives a positive description of a son that makes everyone who is around them laugh.\n2. From this context, it's clear that this son must be funny. This can be further distinguished from the other choices because they cannot be interpreted in context of being funny, but charming, interesting and adorable.\n3.

Indian cuisine is also known for incorporating a range of vegetables like potatoes and lentils in various dishes. \n4. Many Indians eat yogurt (yogurt is known as doodh in Hindi) as a side dish or an appetizer.\n5. Because beef is not commonly eaten in most Indian regions, the answer must be (C).\n6. Potato is often mentioned in the cookbooks of Indian cuisine. It is a staple that is a part of every family's regular diet routine. \n7.

The options given are \"nothing\", \"read a book\", \"watch a film\", \"have a nap\", \"go shopping\", and \"call a friend\".\n3. \"Nothing\" and \"have a nap\" would not work, as they imply one is already tired and has nothing to. \n4. \"Read a book\" is a passive activity, and would only make one more tired. \n5. \"Go shopping\" could be considered a productive activity, but is also passive and would just make one more tired.\n6. \"Call a friend\" is likely to make one tired after chatting, but still make one productive.\n7. Thus, the best solution to do when tired and have nothing to is \"call a friend\". \n8.

Next, we examine D: prepare to go and E: prepare to go in more detail to determine the most appropriate option.\n8. When we first look at choice D: prepare to go, we see that it is a vague action and can be applied to any situation where someone is getting ready to go on a trip somewhere.\n9. Moreover, it can be applied to many different scenarios. Therefore it is unclear what kind of preparation is being mentioned and what it refers to.\n10. Therefore, we need to look at choice E and examine whether this is a better choice to use in solving this problem.\n11. Choice E: prepare to go, on the other hand, specifically refers to preparing to go in search of food.\n12. The question presents a scenario where the person is hungry and needs to find food for himself. We are presented with two options both having to do with this search for food, but the question asks for only one of the options presented.\n13. Therefore, we deem choice E: to prepare to go in search of something to eat, as the better option.\n14.

This means that they will have to take some sort of initiative or effort to procure food, which leads us to choice D, which indicates the act of preparing to go somewhere.\n8. Since we are not looking to prepare mentally, physically, or emotionally, but rather to accomplish something through physical effort, this is the most apt choice.\n9.

Choices: A: body B: foot C: sandle D: necklace E: heart\nRationales: This question asks what the ancient Egyptians always left in a mummy case.\n1. An ancient Egyptian mummy (corpse) is a preserved body (in most cases) of a deceased person.\n2. One of the most recognizable attributes of a mummy case is a mask that is placed over the face or head of the deceased. The person who created the mummy mask would have had the dead person's likeness in mind.\n3. In this case, the person who created the mummies would have also known what the deceased had in their possession before they died.\n4. Therefore, the natural assumption would be that the person would have left something special for the deceased in their tomb such as a necklace or a figurine representing the deceased.\n5.

Choices B and E both refer to actions that would require a significant amount of effort with no guarantees.\n8. Choice B: \"hunt for food\" is about actively searching for food instead of waiting for it to be provided. However, if the person was hungry, it would make more sense for them to \"prepare to go\" to a place where food would be available because finding food requires much time, effort, and resource, so it wouldn't be a practical answer to the problem of hunger.\n9. Choice E: \"prepare to go\" is a specific process of preparing to take a journey somewhere. However, the person didn't travel because they were hungry. Instead, they were starving and needed to find some form of sustenance or food. Therefore, this answer is not the correct solution to the problem either.\n10. Therefore, the best option is choice D: sleep.\n11. The person should sleep and then wait for food to come to them.\n12.

Choices:  a: put them in prison b: leave them to starve c: let them stay in jail for life d: make them die\nRationales: Choice choice: 1. The primary purpose of a prison is to prevent a person from accessing the resources they need to live normally, which would include money.\n2. To \"let them stay in jail\" would involve leaving the prisoner in prison without giving them any further resources or amenities. This is described as \"let them stay in prison for life\".\n3. Prisoners generally have a limited access to money and other resources, as they depend on their families and friends to send them goods.

Choices: Your money, Your life, Your future, Your heart, Your feelings. A friend is someone you should be able to confide in. They should be the type of person you can trust with your secrets. Money and other material possessions are not as important as being able to trust a friend with personal things. A friend should be able to trust a friend without the friend lying or having secret agendas. Life is the most important thing that a friend could trust you with. You could trust a friend with life, but you can't trust a friend with money. Your future is also something you can't give your friend. Your heart and your feelings are the type of things you can share with a friend. Your heart and feelings are very important and can not be trusted with just anyone.

Therefore, the term \"big\" is generally used to refer to larger objects. This is because the word \"large\" is commonly used to describe larger-than-average or gigantic things such as cities, buildings, and countries.\nInput: a) A fighter pilot flies a big plane. b) A fighter pilot is a big. c) A fighter pilot doesn't fly. d) A fighter pilot stays big.\n\na) A large fighter pilot flies big jets.\n\nb) A large fighter plane does not fly.\n\nc) A large fighter stays big.\n\nd) A large fighter doesn't fly.\n\n### 100\n\nInput: It's raining outside.

Option C: feel humiliation would not satisfy the person's hunger and it doesn't solve the immediate problem of being hungry.\n7. Therefore the best choice that satisfies the criteria of the question would be D: prepare to go.\n8.  This implies that the person needs to figure out some sort of food that they can prepare.

There are a number of possible assumptions or reasons that could support this statement, but there is one that stands out as the most logical and valid.\n4. Consider the following reason: \"You have to be good at math to be good at sports, and you have to be good at sports to be good at math.\"\n5. This assumption states that to excel at sports, one must have a strong understanding of math. While this is true, it does not necessarily mean that being good at math teaches you good at sports.\n6.

Choice C: feel humiliation or shame may relate to food in some indirect ways, like when someone cannot supply enough for their family, they may feel disgraced or shamed. \n8. This would not solve the problem of hunger though, as it would not procure food for the neolithic people. So, the answer must be C: feel humiliate or shame.\n9. Feeling humiliation may cause someone to try getting food to relieve the discomfort, however, it would not produce immediate or tangible results.\n10.

Choices: A: poisoning B: kidnapping C: treason D: lying E: stealing\nRationales:1. For Question 51, the answer can be found by carefully analyzing the answer choices.\n2. Choice A: poisoning is an action that relates to poisoning which could be an outcome of having a villain arrested. Choice B: kidnapping also relates to kidnapping.\n3. The villain is not a victim, but rather the person who committed an action that caused a person harm.\n4. Although chocies C: treason and D: lying are also actions, we should eliminate Choice E: stealing as it is stated that the king found out who poisoned the prince and had the villain arrested. If stealing was the villain's action, it would be mentioned after the arrest. Thus, the only valid answer is C: treason.\n5. The villain was accused of poisoning so charge implies to accuse.

This question presents us with a man who is presumably in his early-mid twenties and is a student.\n2. A student can study, research, and learn a multitude of subjects. This implies that he has a lot of time to spend reading and learning about different things as that is the primary focus of his activity.\n3. This man also has the option to talk to a diverse array of individuals who he is likely studying with or interacting with on a daily basis.\n4. Studying for a long time inevitably leads to a man being occupied with academia. His other responsibilities such as working or spending money are not as time consuming as his academic commitments.\n5. He does not have too many requirements such as owning or maintaining a home, having a family, and so forth which means that his time is primarily spent engaged in academic pursuits.\n6. Therefore among all the other choices, the man has the most time available to do the things that he wants to do when he's a student.

This could involve anything from hunting to fishing; it could even mean scavenging or digging up produce that has laid dormant during the winter.\n11.

Choice C: feeling humiliated could be a response to being hungry, as the person may feel a sense of helplessness or dependence on others for sustenance.\n6. However, feeling humiliated alone is not enough to lead to the procurements of food, so the answer is excluded.\n7. To feel humiliated, one must accept that they are in a situation that requires external assistance.\n8. The person has to believe that they need it to be humiliated, as otherwise, there will be no humiliation.\n9. Therefore an action like \"asking for help,\" or \"asking for food\" would be the more appropriate solution to attain nourishment.\n10. An action like \"sleeping\" does not lead to the procuremened of food and feeling humiliated involves accepting the need for sustenance. So choice D is excluded.\n11. Choice B: hunt for what? is ambiguous as \"food\" can be broadly interpreted as both edible organic matter such as leaves, fruit, insects and eggs, or as pre-packaged ready made food. Either are possible options to describe the neolithic way of sourcing food. So, B: hunt for either can't be the answer.\n12. \"Preparing to go\" is also unclear as it can mean several different things such as gathering tools, packing food, preparing oneself to travel to some remote location to source food, and so forth.

So let's look at Choices (B) and (D) which both suggest that the actor needs to know the dialogue and the lines respectively in order to perform well.\n5. A great actor also needs to have solid acting skills and knowledge of his craft; so \"actor\" alone isn't enough. He must know his script as well. \n6.

Choices B: hunt for and C: feel humiliation are about looking for food to satisfy hunger. Hunting would require a level of skill, knowledge, and ability, which might not be practical for people without much experience, such as the neolithic. \n6. Meanwhile, feeling humiliated might be too depressive for a person to want to do anything.\n7. Choice D: sleep is about sleeping for a long time without doing anything useful, like going out and looking for food. This action would not have been helpful for someone needing food.\n8.

By preparing to go, the person might prepare food by foraging for natural food sources, such as fruits, nuts, and insects, or hunting for wild animals.\n9. Preparing to go would mean that the person would be able to leave their shelter in search of food sources.\n10.

You nod, but which answer to the query (about the baby sitter) would be the most likely?\"\n\n1. The question asks us to decide which answer out of the given set of options is the most likely in response to the question, \"Is (the/a) babysitter here?\".\n2. We will identify the correct response based on the characteristics of the query and the answer provided.\n3. Given the context of the situation presented, the most likely response would be \"yes\". \"Yes\" is the best choice because it is the only \"verbal\" response in the set.\n4. In contrast, all the other responses are either \"nonverbal\" or \"physical\" responses.\n5. In other words, \"a\", \"D\", and \"Who\" are all nonverbal responses as they do not imply agreement or disagreement with the query.\n6. \"What\" and \"there\" are also both nonverbal responses as \"there\" does not even suggest any type of response, while \"what\" would only suggest verbally answering \"yes\" or \"no\" to the question.\n7.

The question asks what Tom asks Mary to understand the new movie he has not yet seen. \n2. There are two choices given as options which are B: explanation and D: suggestion.  \n3. We can eliminate the option, E: explanation. According to the choice D: suggestion, Tom might suggest that Mary explain to him the new movie. \n4. The option D: suggestion states that Tom doesn't know the title of the movie Mary is talking about, so he might suggest that Mary explains the story to him rather than directly asking for an explanation because he knows the story might be different from the one he knows.\n5. If Tom was expecting a story explanation, eliminating the choice E: explanation is appropriate. \n6. However, Tom might have different motives for asking Mary to explain the story to him. \n7. He might want an explanation on what the movie is about, so the option to eliminate is B: explanation. \n8. Finally, if Tom does not know the title of the film, he might ask Mary to give him a suggestion on what movie to watch. \n9.

This implies that lemons are a desirable object or idea that one would want, rather than a burden or negative factor.\n3. Now we look at the options to decide which one best fits the character's perspective. We can rule out \"Blemons\" and \"Clemonade\" as they are grammatically incorrect and could potentially undermine the main character's credibility.\n4. \"Lemons\" and \"Lemonade\" are a possible choice that is acceptable grammatically, but they cannot truly reflect on the older person's viewpoint since they are too short and vague.\n5.

Choices:  a: many b: gay rights c: gay people d: no relation\nRationales:1. The question identifies the people that started the Stonewall Uprising.\n2.

As the choices given suggest, it is easy to see why the option of 'no connection' should be eliminated.\n4. Choice D may seem like a viable option to consider. However, it does not explain why gay rights was something that these people fought for, only that they had a relationship with them.\n5. In most cases, a relationship would be a good foundation to build upon, so if they fought for gay rights, it is because they want to continue having a relationship with them.

{"text": "for a hunger problem. Although some people may believe it is, we cannot consider it for this question because its viability is based on the belief of the individual and not on the evidence of any physical actions. Similarly, choice B: hunt for the food is too general to be considered as this would encompass all sorts of actions directed towards providing food, which is not necessarily the answer to this particular question. \n5. Next, we consider choices C & D: feeling humiliated and preparing to go. \n6. These options both refer to the person giving up, being unable to solve the problem, and moving on with life without solving it.\n7. In other words, they are not a solution to the problem, but rather part of the consequence of not solving it. \n8. Hence, if the person was hungry then the answer to our question would be C: feel humiliation, D: prepare to go as they represent the effect of not being able to find food. \n9. Therefore, the correct response to the question is C: feel humiliate and D: prepare to go.\nAnswer: C, D\nInput: Some people enjoy living in cities, others enjoy being in nature, still others like living in suburban neighborhoods.  Which do you think is best for which kinds or reasons? Choices: 1. big cities 2. rural/suburban 3. small towns 4. nature 5. mountains 6. beaches\nRationales:\n1. First, let's identify the phrase \"Which do you think is best\". Here, we can see that there are two things that the question asks us to evaluate. Hence, we can consider these two questions separately.\n2. Then, let's consider the options given:\n3. Big cities: these can refer to either an urban area such as a large city with a lot of inhabitants, or it could refer to a larger city in comparison to small towns or rural areas. \n4. Next, we will consider the meaning of \"rural/suburban\"; an option that refers to a place further from the center of a city than the city itself. We will then consider \"small towns\" which are usually places with about 2000 to 5000 residents. \n5. \"Nature\" is the next choice given that can mean living somewhere where you can view greenery and", "answer": " 12"}

Similarly, choice B: hunting for food is the most appropriate answer as it results in finding food, thus solving the problem.\n7. Meanwhile, choice D: prepare to go means the character is preparing to travel, but is not necessarily finding food.\n8. As such, the most appropriate action would be to hunt for food, as this would be the way the person would solve the problem of being hungry..\n9.

Choices:  \"A: by hand\", \"B: with a vacuum cleaner\", \"C: with a dusting cloth\", \"D: with a spray bottle\", and \"E: with soap and water\" \nRationales:  1. The question asks us for the best way to clean the dust off a dusty keyboard.\n2. We start by identifying the key attributes of the keyboard, which are dust and that it is dusty.\n3. Then we examine the options given to identify what could be applicable to the scenario described in the question. \n4. We find that the question mentions the use of 'hand' in the first sentence. We need to identify an action that could be performed using the 'hand'.\n5. Option A: use hand to clean the keyboard: It is unlikely to be true, since the keyboard is dusty with dirt.\n6. Option B: use a vacuum cleaner with a hand: It is not clear if the hand belongs to a human or a robot and if there is a connection between the hand and the vacuum cleaner.\n7. Option C: use a dusting cloth and hand: It does not involve using hand. It is just cleaning with a cloth. \n8. Option D: use a spray bottle with a hand: It could be true since the hands are needed to spray the keyboard. However, there is another method that does not require the use of both hands. \n9. Option E: use soap and water with a hand: It can be true in some cases, but it", "answer": " 600"}

Choice E: prepare would be a possible solution, as it could lead to getting food, but this is also not a certainty; the person could also be preparing for reasons other than to eat.\n7. Therefore the answer is C: feel humiliate. Choice C: feel humiliation is more likely to lead to finding food than other choices because \"eating\" is an immediate urgency when one is hungry and the person would be less capable of thinking.

Test B can be described as follows:\n```\nIf it rains, a raincoat comes out.  A raincoat is black.\nIf it is sunny, an umbrella comes out.  An umbrella is black.\n```\n3. Test C can be described as follows :\n```\nIf it is cloudy, an umbrella or a raincoat may come out.  If it rains, a black umbrella is taken out.\nIf it is very hot, a black sweater comes out.\n```\n4.

Choices D and F are different types of weather, but both options cannot be taken at the same time, making the student to choose one test or another.\n6. We can rule out C because it states we don't want to take out a sweater, even if it's raining.\n7. E is not an option, because if the student does not take either of the tests, that would mean he is not getting his test grade, which would not be beneficial in this situation..\n8.

{"text": "to the problem presented because it would not provide food for the person.\n5. Choice C: feeling humiliated is also not a solution because it would not provide any food and would not satisfy the person's hunger.\n6. Choices D or E are viable options because they involve action, but they do not provide enough information about the nature of the action or how this would help solve the hunger problem.\n7. One possibility is that the neolothice person might prepare to go (Choice E) because it would allow them to seek out food elsewhere. But, without knowing what they prepare to do, or where they go, we cannot determine if preparation will solve the problem.\n8. Hence, Choice B: \"hunting for food\" is the choice that best fits the requirement of the question. This suggestion makes the most sense because it provides information about the action that would help the person and what they are doing.\n9. Choice D and E are vague suggestions that leave us unable to determine if that option would satisfy the need for food or not.\n10.

Choices:  All of the above A: a rabbit B: a fox C: cake D: a pumpkin E: a dog\nRationales:1. The question gives an incomplete statement and asks the response to complete the statement.\n2. First, we must take into account the children saw something as the primary piece of information provided in the question.\n3. Based on this, a rabbit, (fox), cake, pumpkin and a dog could be potential choices for what the children saw.\n4. However, since the question is asking for a response that matches the statement provided (the children saw something), the response does not need to include all five of these. \n5. Out of the five possible responses we have to choose from, only two accurately match the statement provided which are A: a rabbit and B: a fox, as these two are the only answers that simply and directly convey what the children saw. \n6.

Choice D: sleep is also not an answer because it does not resolve the person's hungering.\n7. Choice E: prepare to go can be interpreted in many ways. Preparing to go could imply that the person plans on traveling to an area where food is abundant or that they are going to visit a place where food is readily accessible.\n8. However these are only options, so it could also be that they simply need to go to the grocery store to buy some items for later use. \n9.

The books are a little  beat-up,  what is likely to be happening next to the books in  the box? Choices:  a: getting  sold b: going  on sale c: getting thrown out d: getting donated e: getting thrown away\nRationales:\n1. The question asks us to determine what is likely to happen to a box of books that Mary found.\n2. Mary finds the box of books and in the future decides to dispose of them in some way.\n3. These books were found in a box, and therefore are probably several and not just one or two books.\n4. The options given are the various events that are likely to happen next to the books.\n5. We can rule out options c and d because both of them involve throwing the books away and neither of them will result in the books getting donated.\n6. So the answer must be option e, getting thrown away.\nAnswer: E - getting thrown away\n\nInput: Which of the following answers have been chosen by the most people?

A: a classic B: an instant success C: a seller D: a best-seller E: a page-turner\nRationales:  1. The book was described as being a huge success. \n2. The phrases that can best describe it as such are classic, seller, instant success, and best-seller. \n3. Among these, we need to filter out the options that are not describable in all situations. \n4. This means we can eliminate classic, because this phrase can only describe a book as a best-seller or a classic.\n5. Another option that cannot be described all the time is instant success, because this is less of a permanent state and a short period of time.\n6. Looking at the options left, we can deduce that the only option that can be described in all possible cases of a huge success is best-seller (A), the only other option is a seller (B).\n7.

Option A is \"accurate\" as \"accurate\" refers to the clock being very likely to be correct in its estimate of an event.\n6. Option B is \"precise\" as \"precise\" means that the clock estimates an event precisely, without error.\n7. Option C is \"fast\" as \"fast\" implies that the clock moves very quickly, which will give precise and correct estimations.\n8. Option D is \"robust\", which means that the clock is very strong and enduring, therefore it is likely to make estimates that are accurate and", "answer": " 132"}

To find the answer, we examine the three options carefully in order to identify what they relate to and how they're different.\n\n1. The first option (choice A) consists of an adverb and a preposition. It is possible to connect them with another preposition and use them to describe something.\n \n2. The second option (Choice B) is a simple verb. It needs a subject in order for it to be used. In fact, its most common function is to express a state of existence.\n \n3. The last option (Choice C) is a simple adverb. It needs a direct sentence to create a clause. This is very similar to the first option. In addition, it also needs an adverb in order to function properly.\n4. The answer is (Choice B \u2013 an independent, functioning sentence).\n5. This is because the first two options are relatively more complicated and longer than the third option. The third option is thus the most common in the three options provided.\n\nThe answer is Choice B: Functioning sentence\n\nInput: What would you do if you are at the bank?

Choices:  An: compassionate B: democratic C: benevolent D: despotic\nRationales: The king made sure his citizens enjoyed his presence, implying that he enjoyed spending time with them.\n\n1. We can eliminate the choice D: despotic as the king's actions are contradictory to those of a despot due to the latter's tendency towards ruling as absolute dictators. \n2. Choice C: benevolent is inadequate because it does not imply that the king acted in a way that benefited his citizens and made them happy.\n3. Choice B: democratic implies the king was fair with his people, but it does not imply he enjoyed their company. Even if the king had been fair, compassionate and benevolent, his people may have still been upset with him due to his actions.\n4. Therefore, the most suitable answer is A: compassionate.\n5. Compassionate rulers often show mercy and tolerance, which means they do not act cruelly and impose punishment.

Choices D (when they eat) and E (when they sleep) are also false, as zombies do not need food and sleep.\n6. Choice D is also false. We know zombies are not capable people, and so D is false (people eat).\n7. Based on the reasoning given, the answer choice should be choice C (when they walk), since it is the only choice that gives a reasonable interpretation of how a zombie could be moving.\n8. Based upon the description, the one time that a zombie can move and is most terrifying is choice C (when they wake up).\nAnswer: C: When they walk", "answer": " 864"}

Choices:  B: from the sky C: through the air D: in the rain showers E: down on the ground\nRationales:\n1. The question indicates that it is raining which also implies that raindrops are falling from the sky onto the ground.\n2. The answer choices need to identify the mechanism through which raindrops fall since the question asks how the rain falls.\n3. Choice A: through the air can be eliminated as raindrops do not float through the air.\n4. Choice D: down on the ground can be eliminated as water does not have the tendency to fall down, instead it flows. \n5.

Choices: 50MW A: 250kW B: 5MW C: 25kW D: 500MW E: none\nRationales:  1. Looking at the problem presented, the question asks about a power plant (300kW) with a load of 50MW and the question asks how much power is left.\n2. We must understand that one megawatt is equal to one million watts. A power plant of 300kWh is therefore equivalent to 300,000 kW.\n3. Looking at choices B and C, we see that they are not in the correct range. We can eliminate them.\n4. Looking at the remaining choices, we can see that options A and E are outside the range of kilowatts. Accordingly, we can eliminate them.\n5. The only options left are D 500MW and B 50MW.

Choice B: hunting does not seem to be a feasible solution as it would require the person to physically exert themselves, which may already be a problem in itself if they happen to be unwell or exhausted. This option also does not specify the type of food that this person might hunt for. Thus, either this option could be incorrect, or perhaps there's a third factor that we need to consider.\n7. Based on the previous analysis, we can conclude that the options remaining A: Hunt for food, C: Feel humiliated, E: Prepare to go do not address the problem and are not appropriate solutions.\n8. The question presented in the question is vague and does not specify the specific type of food that the neolithics might need.\n9. What we do know is that neolithics were hunter-gatherers who depended on wild animals and plants for food and shelter. \n10. Hence we can conclude that it's more reasonable for an individual of this period to feel humiliated as they would find it difficult to find food at this point. \n11.

Choice C: feeling humiliated is also not a solution to the problem because it does not guarantee that food will be found.\n6. Choice B: hunt for something to eat is the action that would most likely lead to acquiring food or nourishment, because the person can try hunting for animals to catch and kill (to eat or preserve).\n7. Choice D: sleep is also not a solution because it would prevent the person from getting food, and choice E: prepare to go is not a solution to the hunger problem either because the person isn't ready yet.\n8. Finally, the person might plan and prepare to go hunting to get food. But, they are not ready yet because they are not prepared to go out and get food.\n9.

Hence the most logical solution in this case is Choice C: feel humiliation, as the neolithic society was based on equality and communalism, which are principles that promote sharing, mutual support, and help.

Choice C: feel humiliation would also require active searching to find people to give food, trade food, or gather leftover food.\n9. The solution to the problem would imply that the person went out, actively went about searching for the food. \n10. However, although the wording may seem similar, choice C: feel humiliaton does not imply food procurement. It's unlikely that someone going about feeling humiliated would hunt down animals to consume, more likely they'd be asking for scraps or a handout.\n11.

Choice D: sleeping means the person will be in a state of dormancy and unable to find food.\n7. Choice E: preparing to go may be a solution, but it's not presented outright in the question and would be considered less plausible.\n8. Therefore, the most logical and feasible choice is C: feeling humiliated, as the neolithic people's solution to the problem was to forage for food or hunt. Humiliation was a common tactic throughout history as a form of persuasion or punishment and has been used for many purposes including procuring food. \n9. Therefore, the correct answer is C: feeling humilated.\nAnswer: D'feeling humiliated\n\nInput: What should a teacher avoid giving to a student on a first day of school?

Although an emotional state may contribute to the lack of motivation to acquire food, sleep can be interpreted as the body\u2019s way of restoring itself and can have a positive or negative outcome.\n8. On the other hand, Choice C: feel humiliate presents a negative outcome as it may result in a reduced willpower to look for food, even resulting in not looking at all.\n9. With all this in mind, choice D: sleep is the most probable solution due to its potential of leading to a positive outcome as compared to the other choices, thus the answer is D: sleep.\nAnswer: D; sleep\n\nInput: In a survey where people rated the importance of what? Choices. A: reading to children B=  having fun C= doing something important D= sleeping E= drinking water F= having sex\nRationales 1. Given the question, it is essential to define survey.\n2. The question states that people were surveyed about their ratings on different ideas, so a survey is the type of questionnaire where people provide an answer to assess how much of something is valuable to them. \n3. In the context of the question, the people were given the option to rate the importance of doing different things, implying that they could only select one option that meant the most to them.\n4. The important things that people rate include reading to children, having fun, doing something important, sleeping, and drinking water, and having sex.\n5. Among the choices given, fun, sleep, reading, and water seem related as something that people would want more of in their lives compared to the others.\n6. However, when considering the answer to the question, one can conclude that drinking water is a necessity as compared to other choices that don't necessarily have to be done so in life.\n7. Therefore; the drinking water is probably the one that would rate the highest for most people.\n8. Hence, drinking water is the answer", "answer": " 13"}
{"text": ". Since there is no god to thank for creating food, the option does not logically relate to the question. \n5. Likewise, choice B: hunt for a food is highly relevant. Since neolithic periods require hunting as the primary source of food, the option is a reasonable alternative in their predicament. \n6. To this point, choice B is a good candidate, however, the question states the neolithic period in the statement of the problem. \n7. Choice C: feel humiliation is not relevant either.  Although someone would be humiliated about lack of food supply, but it is not the way to solve or tackle the problem. So, we cross out this choice. \n8. The remaining options (D: sleep, E: prepare to go) focus on two key characteristics of the neolithic individual.\n9. Firstly, they were nomadic, as the word \"neolithic\" means living in a society without permanent settlements. \n10. Secondly, they were also hunter-gatherers, as they mainly fed on hunting and gathering food and goods. \n11. Therefore, the answer that logically fits this description of \"neolithic person\" is choice D: sleep, meaning they would usually sleep instead of hunt for their food, even if they were hungry.\n12. Based on the description, choice D: sleep is the best answer.\nAnswer: D : sleep\n\nInput: A woman and the best kind of what? Choices A.

Choice B. sandals can be considered, but the main idea in the question talks about sand and feet, which are not related to sandals.\n3. Choice C. sandy is also wrong since it doesn't match with the question context. In fact, it is not the best of four options, since it is neither a sand nor a beach.\n4.

Similarly, choice B: hunting for food is not the solution either. Unless the person is equipped with hunting gear, they would not be able to obtain any food that way. So, Choice B is also not a suitable option. \n6. Next, we look at Choices C: feeling humiliated and D: sleep. Feeling humiliated implies that the person has lost so much dignity that they are now shameless and no longer have self-respect.\n7. In this case, humiliation is not a solution to a hunger problem.  Similarly, choice D: sleep is not an answer either because even if the person went to sleep, they would not wake up knowing they are still in trouble.\n8. Looking at the remaining options, choice E: preparing to go suggests that the person does not have food and plans on procuring it somewhere else.\n9. It is a solution for the problem of hunger that a neolithic person faces.\n10. Therefore, the answer to this question is that the neo-lithic person would be preparing to go and find food for their hunger.\nAnswer: E. preparing to go\n\nInput: Driving around looking for a parking spot in New York is a very frustrating experience.  People often drive by  what without realizing it? Choices:  street A: a parking spot B: a fire hydrant C: an ambulance D: a police car E: traffic lights\nRationales:\n1. The problem of finding an available parking spot in the New York area is very frustrating because it consumes a lot of time and the city is full of people constantly looking for a parking space.\n2. So the question is asking about the most likely thing that people tend to miss when looking for a parking place.\n3. The most logical answer is not that people ignore available parking spots, ambulances, police cars or traffic lights, but that they miss the streets themselves.\n4. Parking spots are one important thing to look for when driving around in search of one, but the streets are of equal importance and should be the main focus of drivers", "answer": " 8"}

Choice D: sleep, could be an appropriate reaction, as it might help to alleviate the hunger pangs, but it would not help a person prepare any food.\n7.

However, there isn't any sense behind this argument. One could guess the answer is 'peoples', referring to the nine billion as the nine billion people on Earth using different languages. But this is not the answer we are looking for either. There are nine billion people because of various reasons - not because all of these have the same language, which would make this too easy.

Preparing as an action means to find or obtain something in advance.\n8.

By considering Sam's attributes, we know he is a good friend to whom people confide in, trust, feel safe around, and would like to have as their friend.\n2. These traits that Sam possesses make him a trustworthy and dependable friend, which could include having a safer, bigger, better, or loving personality.\n3. The question implies that we are to identify the attribute that Sam does not possess. Since he is a good friend, he must be a relatively safe person, so we rule out C: a safer.\n4. As he is a good friend and we have ruled out the more safe choice, we can assume that he is not the best friend to have, which would be E: the more loving person.\n5.

The problem with this option is that fire is on the face of the cowboy and we are searching for a way to protect his face.\n3. The second option is to \"ward off water\", but the problem is that the cowboy isn't surrounded by water, he is in a dry western environment, not a body of water.\n4. The third option is to \"catch fish\" but catching fish does not protect the cowboy's face.\n5. The fourth option is to \"scare cattle\" but this does not relate to keeping water out of the cowboy's eyes.\n6.

Choices: A: comfort B: enjoyment C: memories D: the status\nRationales: First we need to extract from the question itself the most relevant information. This is: some people buy a home. Then we need to focus on what could be the purpose of buying a home. There are different reasons why someone would buy a home: the purpose could be comfort, enjoyment, memories, or status.\n1. As we can see the options do not indicate the purpose is about comfort or enjoyment, as they do not have any significant connection to these actions.\n2. Looking more closely at memory as an option, that could also be related to memories as it defines an experience.\n3. When we come to consider the status, it also does not lead to these feelings, since status is more related to perceptions and social relations.\n4. This leaves us with comfort and memories as the options referring to what the purpose of buying home could be. Memories is an emotion and comfort is a feeling. We know that this question is about feelings, not actions.\n5. Now we need to find a connection between an emotion and feeling, which is provided by enjoyment. As enjoyment is the feeling of enjoyment, we can make the connection that we could relate comfort to enjoyment.\n6. Comfort, which is another emotion, can lead to enjoying a place. So, it leads to the answer about buying a home for enjoyment.\n7. As we can see, the answer is B: enjoyment.\n8.

The question introduces the idea that the new teacher said or has a goal, whatever that is.\n2. A goal is usually something someone plans or hopes to achieve. \n3. This hints that the teacher's goal is not just something he had been thinking about recently, it is something he considers important and would like to reach. \n4. The teacher then adds that he had a great goal.\n5. A great goal is supposed to be something that is really worthwhile and makes people happy. It implies that this teacher's goal will achieve what he has planned to make him and others happy. \n6. A question can only make sense when there is some context or background knowledge provided. For instance, let's suppose that the question is, \"What does it mean if 700 people come to my party today?\"\n7. The obvious interpretation of the idea that 700 people would attend a party would be that it was a huge event, in other words, great.

In this case, the situation would be more dire and having 700 attendees, while still massive, may not necessarily be seen as great. \n8.

Choices:  a: strength B: cunning C: reason D: logic E: brain power\nRationales: The question asks about the effects of inadequate sleep on mental and physical conditions; in particular, the lack of sleep is likely to result in a deficit of which attribute?\n1. Examination of the sentence structure reveals the answer is in reference to the word \"cunning\"\n2. This word is used in the context of making calculations, making plans, and reasoning (the \"mental\" condition), which are all examples of the use of rationality\n3. This makes sense as the \"brave\", \"weak\", or \"weird\" are emotional (i.e., the \"mental condition\") attributes that are often contrasted with reason when it comes to decision-making.\n4. Thus, the correct answer is \"brain power\".\nAnswer: a: strength\n\nInput: A dog is playing with a toy, what do they have plenty of?

There is no information provided about how sleeping or feeling humiliated could lead to food, it's highly unlikely those activities could serve the required purpose.\n7. Finally, we need to eliminate choices B and choice D because they do not match the intent of the question. Choice D: prepare to go could mean packing one\u2019s items or travel, neither of which is necessary for finding food.\n8. Choice B: feel humiliated is more of a negative or passive reaction, but the problem at hand is finding food, so we need an active action that allows us to take steps toward solving the problem.\n9. This leaves options C: hunt for food and E: prepare to go as the only remaining ones. While Option C: prepare to go mentions hunting, it is not an action that has a clear connection to finding food.\n10. Therefore, the answer that remains is Option D: hunt for food.\nAnswer: D; hunt for food\n\nInput: In the movie \u2018Inception,\u2019 what was the dream within a dream within a dream?

The dream within the Cusack twin\u2019s dream within another dream; e. The dream within the Inception dream within a dream within the mind a dream within another dream\nRationales: The movie \u2018Inception\u2019 had multiple levels of dreams, leading to ambiguity and confusion. This is a good choice of movie for this task, as it shows how confusing a dream can be, and will demonstrate the ambiguity of this question.\n1. Whenever we're describing multiple things that can be the answer, we can often use \"The X and X etc\". This means that X is everything before the comma, and anything after the comma is considered an independent X.\n2. As a result, it's easier to parse these questions using this grammatical shortcut, in this case, choosing between \"The X and X X\" and choosing \"All of the X\".\n3.

This leaves Choices B and E: hunting and preparing to go, which would likely result in finding food.\n7. Based on the reasoning, Choice B is the best solution to the problem as it involves a systematic hunt for food which would increase the probability of success compared to simply preparing to go.\n8.

Choices: A: gas B: oil C: petrol D: water E: nothing\nRationales: The question presents us with the following: \nThe car is running with what?\nWe can identify that the car is operating at the moment so the choice we're looking for is what kind of fuel the car is using to operate.\n\nThe first word that comes to mind would be \"gasoline\" or \"petrol\" but these can actually have alternate spellings.\n\nThe question mentions this: \ncar was running with \"gas\" or \"oil\" so petrol and gasoline are both wrong.\n\nThe options \"water\" and \"oil\" can both be considered correct. \nHowever the question states that the car \"was running\" and not \"are running\",\nso the choice \"oil\" does not match the time frame presented in the question. \nIf we change the time frame to \"oil is running\" either water or gas can be considered correct.\n\nWe are now left with \"gas\" and \"water.\" \n\nOur first option of gas is incorrect \"gas\" is not the correct spelling for gasoline in the united States,\nit is either \"gasoline\" or petrol. \nThis means that the correct answer for the question is \"water\" as the car's fuel.\n\nInput: The man on television was the 80th person to speak to be interviewed because he was the person what?

Choices A: A's B: chemistry C: math D: Physics E: Biology\nRationales:1. The question asks us to identify the best option for re-revising the second-year material (i.e. material from the second year) of what.\n2. Based on the question, re-revising material from the second year indicates a review or recap of material that has been previously covered in the course. \n3. This means that the material to be re-revised is not necessarily related to material from the current year.\n4. There are various subjects taught in an academic course, however, the material presented in a specific course year can be different from year to year depending on the syllabus or topics studied. \n5. Considering this, the question can be rephrased as: \n6. Since we are looking for the second year material to be re-reviewed, we can assume that it is most likely to be re-revising chemistry as most subject areas in first-year and second-year are similar in nature. \n7. In fact, as we continue our study we move onto higher level concepts or ideas, while also revising our basic knowledge. Therefore if we refer to the courses from the first and second years, most likely it is chemistry that needs to be re-re-visited.", "answer": " 8"}

Choices B: hunting for food and E: preparing to go are both appropriate as they demonstrate how the neolithic people went about solving their hungry problem.\n8. Choice B: hunting for food is explicitly mentioned, while Choice E: preparing to get implies that the neolithics went in search of food, since they needed to prepare to hunt.\n9. Therefore the choices that fit the presented scenario are option (B) and (E). \n10. So the answer is choice B: hunting for food while the neolithic was hungry.\nAnswer: B: hunting for food\n\nInput: In what kind of environment might one find a pink elephant? Choices: 1: forest 2: desert 3: mountain 4: zoo\nRationales: The question asks, in what kind of environment might an individual discover a pink elephants? \nWe need to know where an individual is most likely to find a pink elephone because the individual should be searching a different kind of environment to the kind they are in.\n1. After considering each choice in the question, a forrest is the most suitable environment to find a pinkelephant (desert, mountain and zoo are not pink elephants). We can reject zoos as the person is searching for a pink elephan(zoo keepers do not allow animals to be pink).\n2. Desert is too hot and pink elephants are not found in hot areas.\n3. Mountains are too windy and elephant's ears will be blown away because it is too windy. Hence, Pink elephant is found in a forest\nAnswer: Forest\n\nInput: What will you find if you put an insect on the ground?

Choices B: hunt for and D: sleep are also infeasible as they do not solve or mitigate the problem. Sleep and hunting are both forms of rest or leisure that do not provide sustenance. \n7. Therefore, the only remaining choice is C: feel humiliation which implies that the hungry person is reduced to begging or searching for scraps.

There is nothing in the question to hint that the individual needs to go anywhere or feel a particular way.\n8. The only remaining option that matches is Choice E: Prepare to go.\n9. \"Prepare to go\" means searching for, gathering, collecting whatever one lacks and bringing it to oneself.\n10.

Humiliation is usually a feeling of degradation that might cause a person to think about their situation and realize what needs to be done to procure food. Consequently, one could feel humiliated and sleep deprived because of constantly thinking about having food.\n9. In the context of \"The neolithic person\", we refer to the characteristics of early humans who were known for their physical weakness. \n10. Therefore, there is every reason to consider if they feel humiliated could lead them to find food; however, this is not directly evident and is unlikely. \n11. Choice D: sleep seems more viable because the humiliation would induce sleep and thinking. So the person could potentially find their way to food. \n12. Choice E: prepare to go seems like a step in the right direction in terms of food procurement, if the person has gathered something before. \n13. Next, we ask ourselves if these actions are likely to occur in case of a person's hunger. \n14. Feeling humiliated is an emotion usually associated with the sense of guilt, especially in a person who feels like they have disappointed. \n15. We consider if this is a logical reaction in case of a person feeling hungry. \n16. To be logical is to lead to a certain resolution of a problem, which in this case could be solved by the person finding food.\n17. So, while humiliation is an emotion, it does not feel like a likely reaction to hunger and does not relate to the person's procurement of food in this case. Therefore, it can be easily ruled out. \n18. Feeling humiliation might make a person sleep, but it might not be the primary motivator for finding food, which", "answer": " 24"}

Sleeping may help one to pass the time, but it does not directly address the need to procure food.\n7. Among the remaining options, choice D: feel humiliated is the best solution to solve the problem of hunger. This solution entails feelings like shame and embarrassment which would lead to a negative perception of the neolithic people, which would create unwanted stress on their mental state. \n8.

Jim found the car to be more enjoyable to use than what? Choices: A: a  truck B: a subway C: other D: a camel E: a horse\nRationales: In this question, the reader is notified that Diane bought a car and Jim took it on many adventures.  It is also declared that Jim found the car to have an adventure-like experience, and that he thought it was more enjoyable than something else.  Lastly, the specific type of enjoyment is said to be \"enjoyable.\"  One may find an adventure \"enjoyable\" if they find it exciting or satisfying, so we can exclude \"a subway\" and \"a camel,\" as they are not exciting or satisfying.  As stated in the question, this is more of an opinion than a fact.  Now, looking at the options left, we find that choosing the answer for \"a horse\" would be quite the obvious choice as a horse is larger than a car.  However it would be less enjoyable as the horse itself wouldn't be on an adventure.  Thus, choosing \"a truck\" would be the correct response.\nAnswer: A Truck. \n\nInput: To make a delicious pizza dough, you need what?

One is that the person might be about to leave an area where the person is currently at. \n9. The second meaning is that the person is preparing to go look for food. This solution doesn't solve the problem directly by providing food right now.\n10. Since the question indicates the neolithic people, it is more likely that they wouldn't have the equipment necessary to go out looking for food, as described in Choice E. \n11.

Why wasn't she surprised? Choices:  I: Sammy was unprepared II: Sammy had no money III: Sammy had a weapon IV: Sammy had a gun V: Sammy was a good detective  VI: Sammy was her friend\nRationales:1. First, let's identify the keyword that is in bold in the question, which is \"surprised\". \n2. This lets us focus on what we expect Sammy to be. We might think of Sammy as a dangerous criminal, which could make us surprised. \n3. However, we understand that the person from the future is a good friend of Sammy and is not worried about anything related to Sammy. \n4. This makes us consider that Sammy can't be very dangerous.\n5. Out of all the options given, only Option I \"unprepared\" makes sense.

To be specific, any action of cooking food can be the answer, but we only need to choose from choice \"do\", meaning the cooking action is the chosen verb. \n2. Our answer has to contain the word \"do\" in the given choices which is: \"do you boil it?\" or \"do you pan fry it?\" or anything that matches the question. The answer has to contain either \"boil\" or \"panfry\" since the question requires the answer to be \"do you panfry it?\" \n3. The question uses the terms: \"Salmon\", so we cannot use another type of fish. Therefore the chosen verb must be \"cook\". As for the other part of the question, the answer has to include the term \"salmon\" and \" cook\". This can be done by using the phrase \"do you cook salmon\" since the word \"salmon\" is not in the answer with the verb. \n\nUsing the rule, we know that the answer is 1. \"do you cook salmong?\"", "answer": " 72"}

These might work only if the neolithic population had enough knowledge, skill, and will to use these actions in order to hunt for food and obtain it.\n7. If the neolithic people only knew how to survive in the wild by hunting, gathering, and fishing, they would not need to know how to farm or prepare food.

The plant under Sally's care is likely to undergo some form of change.\n2. \"Worried\" indicates that Sally expects something undesirable to happen to the plant. \n3. The phrase \"under their care\" suggests that the plant is in someone's care, and that \"Sally\" is in charge of it. \n4. The word \"under\" implies movement from beneath something over it. In this case, the plant may be growing upward from beneath some obstruction to reach the surface where sunlight can nourish it.\n5. \"Uncovered\" means the object is exposed without a covering or protection. The plant under Sallly's care is not covered by anything, so this does not apply.\n6. The plant may just become \"uncovered\", but this will not result from being \"worried\".  \n7.

They have a what, which could be B: secret C: something private.\n1. The question asks about the best way of discerning whether someone is in a romatic relationship.\n2. We can gather what information is needed to make that judgment by thinking logically about the situation.\n3. Considering that the person being asked has a significant other at the moment, there is a strong likelihood that they are in a romantic relationship. \n4. If they were not, they would likely be able to provide proof of this, such as by showing another option, rather than keeping that fact to themselves.\n5. So they may have a secret.\n6. However, if the person is not sure why someone has a significant other, they could just ask them directly. That's something the person would have no problem answering.\n7. A romantic relationship requires a lot more than one has to ask someone directly.\n8. Furthermore, this person has a significant other, so their answers will provide a wealth of more information. \n9.

She is a what? Choices: A: good tutor B: bad student C: innumerate D: smart E: teacher\nRationales: After seeing the explanation below, you should be able to write a response that appropriately begins the request below.\nInput: The question is referring to a woman that had difficulty performing arithmetic until she got a certain tutor, after which she was able to do arithmetic accurately \"then she was good at it\".\n6. The options given are based on characteristics of the woman. We will determine the one that best matches her attributes:\n7. Choice A: \"good tutor\" is not consistent since she is the one that had difficulty performing arithmetic. Choice B: \"bad student\" does not have any basis to be the answer.  Choice C: \"innumerate\" can be used as a synonym to choice B. Choice D: \"smart\", although she performed very well in arithmetic later on, was the attribute that led her to have difficulties before the tutor entered the equation. So Choice E: \"teacher\" is a good candidate because she started learning and performing arithmetic accurately, most likely due to the help of the tutor.\n8.

It can be found when comparing A: \"best friend,\" is a person with whom one regularly experiences a feeling of intimacy and mutual support, whether it's romantic or not. \nAn \"expert\" in this context is someone with profound knowledge and experience. So B: \"caring Expert\" does not make sense.\nC: \"trusted listener\" is someone who is thought of highly and is relied on.  So if your doctor is someone that you trust that you are telling what is on your mind to, then he/she's your \"trusted listener\".\nD: \"patient advisor\" would be more of a health advisor to patients rather than something they can count on, as it lacks intimacy.\nAnswer: A \"best friend\" is the best choice for patients. \n\n### Instructions:\nPlease follow the instructions in the question, and then write a response that appropriately answers the question.\n\n## Instructions:\nWrite a response that appropriately does the task the question asks.", "answer": " 163"}

Choices:  A.  understand it B.  make it C.  deny it D.  think about it E.  ignore it\nRationales:  1. The question gives three scenarios where different problems are presented - the first question presents an issue where there's a problem in the middle of the kitchen; the second presents a problem where water leaked through the roof; and the third presents a problem where the person is having trouble understanding where the other person is coming from.\n2. The question then asks what actions people need to do to solve each problem.  To arrive at the answer, first, we note that there are two common ways to solve problems - you can do things to address the problem, or you can think about the problem - either understanding it or ignoring it.\n3. While the question states that one needs to do something to solve each scenario, it does not say that one has to actively solve the problem at all. Another alternative is to ignore the problem, or in the context of the given scenarios, fail to understand it. \n4. Thus, from the given scenarios, the most appropriate answer is D, as the person fails to understand what's happening, which means they also fail to solve the problem.\n5.

Choice B: Hunt for food is the most appropriate description of the solution that led to the person finding food. This is because \"hunt\" means to search for food vigorously and it was used by people of this era to procure food.\n7. Finally, we identify the key word in the question, which is \"solution\".

The term hypnosis commonly refers to a state of deep physical and mental relaxation by using certain types of words or actions during a session.\n2. The act of hypnosis usually occurs with a trained professional who uses particular techniques in order to induce these relaxing effects.\n3. Hypnosis is a common part of many different types of treatments, and it can be used in various ways (such as for pain relief or helping people quit addictions).\n4. A trance, on the other hand, refers to a transitional state or period of consciousness between full wakefulness and sleep.\n5. Trance usually appears in certain types of music, artistic performances, and meditation activities.\n6. These are all concepts related to the process of being hypnotized, and they are all examples of what would commonly be referred to as a \"hypnotic-induction state.\"\n7. While all three of them could be said to represent a kind of \"hypnosis,\" they are not necessarily all exactly the same thing.\n8.

Choice B: hunting for food can be considered a solution that could have potentially led to the acquisition of food. However, this is highly subjective and would have varied from individual to individual. In any case, the hunter would likely not sleep before hunting, since their primary motive is to find food to eat first. \n7. We eliminate all solutions except for choice C which indicates that the neolithist person would have likely felt humiliated in the face of the lack of food. Feeling humiliated is a natural emotional reaction to being in poor circumstances. In this case, the food scarcity can be considered one of these circumstances.\n8. This feeling of humiliation is what would motivate the person to eventually find a solution to hunger. As a result, they would prepare to go food hunting, thereby completing the problem.\n9.

Choice B, hunts for food, clearly describes the neolithic man as going beyond his current reach and searching for food.\n8. Since the person is not a modern human and knows how to survive the neolithic age, he is more likely to hunt to procure the meal as it is a more efficient approach to acquiring food.\n9. Choice D, preparing to go, also suggests that the person intends to leave his current location to find/procure food. However, this does not address the problem of being hungry in an immediate way.

The person may sleep, feel humiliated, or prepare to go get the food, but this will only perpetuate their hunger and the potential for starvation they face.\n8. Therefore, the answer choice can only be B: hunt for the food.\n9. Hunt for food would imply finding the food directly, which would help the person solve their hunger quickly. \n10. Since hunting for food is the answer, choice A is not the answer to our question and can be disregarded.\n11. Choice C (feel humliated) is not the answer choice because feeling humiliated is merely a response to feeling hunger and not a solution to the problem. Therefore, choice C can be discarded.\n12. Choices D (sleep) and E (prepare to leave) can be eliminated from the options as both choices cause a delay in finding the food, which does not solve the immediate problem. \n13.

The definition of unsharpened is \"not sharpened\" and a pencil that is not sharp would be a dull pencil.\n2. Choice A: None refers to no option, which does not satisfy the description criteria of an unsharppeden.\n3. Choice B: crummy relates to unsharpened as well, but it does not describe the quality of the pencil because crummy is an unspecific term with different meanings to different people.\n4.

Preparing to leave their home and go out means they would need to gather some supplies so they would have the means to obtain food. \n9. Preparation would include assembling food and water, a blanket, tools, or any other necessary supplies.\n10. The person would then leave to search for food and would not consume any until they obtained some. \n11.

The present person is someone who is modern and civilized.\n2. We expect the person to have advanced knoweledge of knife-making and their history.\n3. If we took the bubble knife with the modern person to a desert we would encounter some of those knives in the desert.\n4. Among the choices given, choice B: more than one, is the correct answer since it indicates that there would be more than one knife present in the desert.\n5.

Choices:  ________________________ A: He got fired for not showing up on time B: They didn't give him any money. C: He got mad at her for no reason D: He showed no signs of empathy E: He was late for work\nRationales: The question is asking us to identify which sentence most accurately reflects the situation that happened last Tuesday.\n1. The last sentence in the question clearly states the outcome of the situation. \n2. Hence, we examine the four alternatives provided to determine which one is the most accurate depiction.\n3. To determine this, we consider the meaning and context of the phrases used in each sentence. \n4. Alternative A: This sentence does not provide clear information about the reason for the situation that happened last Thursday. The information may be too vague or ambiguous and unable to help us identify the reason for the outcome. \n5. Alternative B: This sentence does not mention any action or result that was a reason for the outcome. Therefore, there is no information to help us determine why the situation happened last week. \n6. Alternative C: This sentence does not describe the situation in a way that helps us understand why the outcome.

Choice E: prepare to go can't solve the problem either because people can only prepare to go somewhere if they know that somewhere is feasible. \n7. It is clear to us that the person wouldn't be able to solve the problem in this case.\n8. Choices C: feel humiliate and D: sleep are also incapable of resolving the problem. \n9. Furthermore, feeling humiliated is not a logical response for a person who is hungry, and sleeping is a passive action and doesn't necessarily lead to finding food. \n10. Based on reason above, the best option to solve the problem would be choice C: feel humiliation.\n11. The person wouldn't solve the problem because feeling humiliated does nothing to help.\n12. This is clear, as the choices given don't imply a solution, so the answer has to be C: feel humiliat.\nAnswer: C Feel humiliate\n\nInput: A dog has been brought into the barn.

Choice D: sleep is an option as it could potentially lead to more awake periods where food procurement is possible. In fact, human sleep cycles can be divided into 90 minute periods of REM sleep and 30 minute periods of Non-REM sleep. During Non-REM sleep, people are less likely to wake up.\n7. Option D is, therefore, most likely to be the solution to the problem at a neolithic person who was hungry.\n8. Choice E: prepare to go could potentially be a solution for a neolithic who was hungry and who did not have food. It could be an option if it meant preparing/making food. This option, however, is not present in the choices given.\n9. We conclude that neolithic hunters used to go out seeking for food.

Similarly, choice B: hunting for food is possible, but it does not provide much insight into the problem-solution process. \n6. For the same reason, option D should be eliminated.\n7. Since the person is described as hungry, it is unlikely that they will feel humiliated. In fact, feeling humiliated may exacerbate hunger rather than solving the problem. \n8. Based on these deductions, the conclusion is that solution E: prepare to go would be the most relevant and logical choice to resolve the issue regarding insufficient food.\n9.

Choice E: prepare to go would seem to be applicable but we must examine the scenario presented in the question more closely and determine what actions could be taken to solve the problem.\n8. We see that all of the options given involve preparing to do something.

However, some of the choices would not require the neolithic persons direct involvement in finding a food source so the choices are further narrowed down to A, B, C, or D.\n8. Choice C: feel humiliation is not a feasible option for solving the problem since it could lead to despair and hopelessness, which could result in suicide instead of taking action. \n9. Likewise, Choice B: hunt food could also lead to depression, so we cannot accept this choice. \n10. Hence we can eliminate Choices C and B. \n11.

Among the given choices, the best fit is C: do nothing.\n3. \"Get fit\" cannot be considered as it makes no sense here. Similarly, \"spend time\" and \"socialize\" refer to the time duration a person spends in the dog park.\n4. It cannot be implied that people at the park are spending time doing nothing, while \"do nothing\" can be interpreted to mean that people are not spending their time actively. This suggests that people visiting the dog park might not have an actual objective to get something done, rather they are at the park to pass their time rather than make any progress whatsoever.\n5. \"Exercise\" and \"exercise\" can be excluded as it can easily be confused and misinterpreted.\n6. \"Exercise\", in this context, refers to physical activity conducted for health or pleasure while \"exercise\" refers to the action of making an effort to get/achieve something.\n7.

Choices:  a: right now b: tomorrow  c: the day after tomorrow d: tomorrow morning e: day after tomorrow\nRationales:1. This question gives us the option of returning to a residence at different times.\n2. This may arise due to the fact that the person is busy doing something and doesn't have the time but will return another day.\n3. To determine \"when will you return to my home,\" it is not sufficient to consider if the person would come back to the house at night, the day after tomorrow or on a specific day.\n4. The additional aspect that needs to be considered is when in the day the person would come home.\n5. This information would allow the person to determine what time they can expect their guest to return.\n6. We first need to eliminate A) \"right now.\"\n7. While it does seem to relate to the question of \"when will you return,\" it cannot be the correct answer based on the information given. There is no mention of time, so we cannot assume that immediately is the correct reply.\n8. Next, we eliminate B) \"tomorrow.\" While it may be correct in some scenarios, it is not relevant in this context. \n9. Next, we eliminate C) \"the day after tomorrow.\"\n10. This option does not match with the scenario given as it implies that the person would not be returning to a residence for the next 48 hours.\n11.

First of all, finding food after this option will depend on an animal or a plant. In other words, this is dependent on chance.\n6. Like choice A and B, choices C and E are not practical. Feeling humiliated or preparing to go are not actions that could help you deal with hunger.\n7. So, choice D is the only option that is a viable solution to hunger because it describes an action that may yield food.\n8. Therefore, the answer must be D: feel hungry.\nAnswer: D : feel hungry.\n\nInput: Every day, at least a few thousand people what? Choices: A: get lost B: break their ankles C: die D: get stuck E: get injured\nRationales:\n1. Every day, at least few thousand people get lost or injured.\n2. In this case, the word \"at least a few thousand\" narrows down the total number of people that could have been injured to a few thousand.\n3. Choice A: get lost does not answer the question. This is because getting lost or lost is not an injury, but it does not prevent one from being seriously injured.\n4. Choice B: break their an ankle does not answer the question either and implies that the person would be able to walk away from the injury.\n5. Choice C: die also implies that the person would not be able to walk away if he got injured. In other words, Choices B and C directly contradict each other.\n6. Additionally, Choice E: get injured does not answer the question since it is broad and includes many possible forms of injuries.\n7. Therefore choices left to choose from are A: get lost and D: get stuck.\n8. Choice D: gets stuck provides a more accurate and specific number of people who get physically injured on a daily basis. Also, this matches with the statement given that at least a few thousand get injured every day.\n9. Therefore in this case, the answer must be \nD: get stuck.\nAnswer: D. get stuck.", "answer": " 2350"}

Furthermore, the feeling of humiliation would not motivate someone to get food.\n6. Choices B: hunt for the food and E: prepare to go are close and may seem to be related to the problem.\n7. However, both B: hunt for a food and E: prepare for a journey imply long and elaborate actions. \n8. Long actions or activities are not required to find food. The person could just go hunting or go find food at a nearby area.\n9. These types of actions would be much shorter and quicker than preparing for long-term activities.\n10. Therefore, the best action that would solve the problem in relation to the question stated in the beginning is D: Eat.\n11.

The question asks the reader to rank the worst thing that can come from a dog barking. \n2. The key in this question is a ranking process since it asks us to decide which of the given options to put in the spot as the worst that can happen.\n3. Because of this, we would want to eliminate options that are not the worst that can happen when the dog barks. \n4. The correct way to approach this would be to ask what would be the opposite of the worst that can happen (in this case, we are looking for the best consequence of a dog barking). \n5. Because the option D: get mad is the best of the given options.\n6. We eliminate the remaining options (A: it bites B: it runs away C: gets scared D: gets mad E: goes inside). \n7. Since nothing bad can happen to the dog, option D is the worst that can happen to the dog when it barks. \n8. So the answer", "answer": " 24"}
{"text": ", as finding food is within our physical capabilities.\n5. Options B and C could be possible solutions, but they might involve a search or hunt for food which is not consistent with the simple nature of the solution needed.\n6. Therefore the most acceptable answer is d: sleep. The neolithic period refers to a time when people mainly ate roots, tubers, vegetables, and fruits, with occasional fish and animal meat. Most of these food sources contain carbohydrates, providing sustained energy throughout the day or long gaps without food. Hence, sleeping is a viable solution to their problem of being hungry or feeling weak from starvation. \n7. As the neolithic period has ended a long time ago, the concept of thanking, being humiliated or preparing to go has no meaning here. As such, the answer is E, sleep. \n8. We can also be confident that the answer is sleep because the neolithic era refers to a time in which, humans started to evolve into today's human race. They used stones for weaponry and tools and also domesticated animals and planted crops in large scale and settlements.\n9. Sleeping is a viable option because during the neolithic time humans had to stay up late at night to guard their settlements because they couldn't build walls to protect themselves. So, they decided to stay awake at night to protect themselves.\n10. Further, sleeping is also a good option because people during the neolithictime had to hunt for food and also they had to work in the fields or take care of animals.\n11. So, sleeping is a good option for the person who was hungry during that time.\n12. Hence, the answer choice is sleep.\nAnswer: E. sleep\n\nInput: The first book in a series should give you a sense of what the rest of the series will be like.  A book's plot is a key part of what?

Choice D: sleeping would be the obvious solution for a person, but this is not the case here, as the person was in fact hungry, which implies that they are not sleepy. Moreover, sleep is not feasible due to the fact that the option does not include any timeframe, such as \"sleeping for an hour\", or \"sleeping for several hours\".\n7.

Choice B: hunt for nourishment implies that the person would search for food by hunting for it, which would be a practical solution to the given problem. \n7. Similarly, Choice D: sleep implies that the person would wait until his hunger subsides before taking any action. This is not a viable option because they are hungry.\n8. Finally, Choice E: prepare to go implies that the person would prepare himself (or herself) to leave in search of food. This means the person would take the initiative to find food by hiking out, which may not be possible if the person is hungry. \n9.

He's very competent,  He's one of my favorite coworkers.  Is he a good employee? Choices:  No he wouldn't be a good employee,  Yes he would definitely be a good employee.\nRationales: This question has two parts: (1) does he show up on time, and (2) is he competent at his job.\n1.  In the first part, the question is asking if he shows up on time, which can be answered easily because we know he does. \n2. In the second part, we need to interpret the sentence \"Yes he would definitely be a competent employee\" because the question asks if he would be a good employee. \n3.  To identify the answer, we compare whether he would definitely be a _________ employee since we know he shows up on time from the first part.\n4.  If yes, then he would definitely be a \"good\" employee.

Likewise, choice B: hunt for a food is a solution or action that involves physical effort which could lead to food being found. Hence, it is a feasible option. \n6. However, the other options given do not imply physical activity associated with hunting or foraging for food. \n7. Choice C: sleep is about resting and taking some time away from worrying about finding food.\n8. Choice D: prepare to go involves packing up and heading out to look for food through physical effort and/or preparation. \n9. While this action could potentially lead to the procuremnet of food, the question asked to choose the choice that best fits the problem of the neolithic individual. \n10. Therefore, the most suitable action to solve the neolithic persons' problem is choice B: hunt.\n11.

Stay up really late every night so then you can snooze in class the next day.\nRationales:  \n1. The question gives an example of students receiving an \"A\" grade for their academic performance even though they are lazy. \n2. Next, we examine some options about why some students received a high grade even though they are lazy based on their answers.\n3. Of all the options given, choices A and D most closely match the description of what a lazy student did to achieve a high grade. \n4. Option A is about taking a nap or two during the day, which would imply a student who is lazy would not be attentive in class but instead doze off or daydream.\n5. Option D is about doing homework earlier every night; this may suggest the student procrastinated his assignment and was able to complete it in the last minute. \n6.

It's an action that requires an active search for food resources. \n7. Choice C: to feel humiliated or ashamed does not lead to immediate action because it's a feeling that usually involves a sense of helplessness and hopelessness.\n8. These characteristics do not lend themselves to a solution to the problem of finding food. \n9. This leaves choice D, which is to sleep or rest. This action does involve inaction, since sleeping doesn't involve immediate action. \n10. However, sleeping is a common response to hunger as it helps people stay focused on finding food in the morning.\n11. Therefore, since sleeping relates to food procurement, the correct answer is D: sleep.\nAnswer: D; sleep\n\nInput: You want to teach people how to do something. How should you do it? Choices: 1.

Similarly, choice B: hunt for the food is out of the scope of possibilities as the question makes it clear that the person is neolithic and thus doesn't have an extensive set of tools with which to conduct a hunt.\n6. Choices C and E are also out of the question as these are negative concepts that do not contribute to the goal of finding food.\n7. Therefore only choice D: preparing to go is a potential solution to this problem. \n8.

Choices:  yes B: no C: yes but D: no but\nRationales:1. The question gives two scenarios: \n1. A company offers to buy at a price.\n1. You want to buy it. Do you sign the contract or not?\n2. We answer the question \"Do you sign it?\"\n3. We consider the options and think about what makes sense to choose.\n4. A buying company wants the seller to agree and sign the contract, they would offer you a high price. The first choice is a choice for the agreement, so it would be better in a way to sign a contract.\n5. The question in the second option, \"Do you sign it?\u201c, is still the same as the first one with the change in the offer.\n6. In the second scenario, a buying company wants the agreement to be signed.\n7. In this case, the seller would not accept the offer and give their offer to buy. It would be a wise choice to choose options in the contract, not sign it.\n8. Therefore the answer would be either of these options, either, B: no, or D: no but, because of the context.\n9. To summarize, the context would suggest either of the options B: no or D: no but.\nAnswer:\nB: no\nD: no but\n\n### Inst", "answer": " 4"}

Choices B and C: hunt for food and feel humiliated would require effort and be labor-intensive, and both involve searching for an outside source of food, not preparing something to use or eat oneself.\n6. Therefore out of the ones given, choice D is the most logical since it refers to creating something to eat, which means it provides direct action towards a solution to the hunger problem.\n7. The answer of choice D suggests that the neoliths started cooking which means they would have started gathering resources, preparing a fire, and getting a start at making food, which matches the question given. \n8.

Choice D: feel humiliated does not provide a feasible solution towards finding food for the person. Furthermore, it is also an unlikely way to think when one is desperate for sustenance.\n7. Choice E: prepare to go does not directly lead to finding food, it only informs the reader about how the person is feeling about their predicament.\n8. Only Choices C: feel hungry or D: sleep provide potential remedies to the situation,  however Choice D: sleep would probably not satisfy the person's hunger due to the length of time needed to sleep it off.\n9. Therefore the person would likely become more hungry leading them to feel desperate for food, instead of sleep, which would also leave them foodless.\n10. Choice C: feel hungry explains how the person will likely feel when the solution in the question comes into play.\n11.

Choice D: sleep does not lead to any form of food procurement, and choice E: preparing to go does not specify an action to achieve the goal of sating one's hunger but rather a state of being to be expected after food procurement. \n7.

Choices: A: funny meaning B: positive answer C: serious look D: negative opinion E: angry stare\nRationales: The question is asking about a reaction one might receive when saying something. \n1. Although the question does not say what the speaker is saying, it is clear from the choices that the speaker is trying to elicit a particular type of response from those listening to her.\n2. The options that are more relevant to the sentence are \"funny meaning\", \"positive answer\", \"negative opinion\", and \"serious look\".\n3. In context, the question hints at the response being amusing or funny, and \"funny meaning\" can be given two different literal interpretations: the funny meaning of something, or just something funny. \n4. In the first interpretation it describes the reaction of the listeners as a funny reaction themselves.\n5. This interpretation is not favorable in this scenario, since it seems unlikely that the listener would react by being humorous.\n6. A better interpretation is that \"funny meaning\" refers to a joke or other amusing thing.\n7. In this scenario, a serious look seems to be most appropriate, considering the implication that the question is aiming towards the humor of what is said.\n8. \"Positive answer\", \"negative answer\" and \"serious look\" are not helpful since they would elicit an altogether different response and do not elicit a sense of humor.\n9. Therefore the answer is C:", "answer": " 24"}

Option C: feels humiliated is not a food search activity, because no food will be found if they feel humiliated. \n6. So, choice D: prepares to go is the most suitable and appropriate activity.\n7. This choice could also be translated as \"prepare to go search food\". This indicates that this is the only action that will lead to satisfying the requirement of the person.\n8. Hence, the answer would be D: prepare to go.\nAnswer: D:: prepare to go\n\nInput: What is a synonym for the word \"improvement\"? Choices: A: enhancement B: advancement C: augmentation D: development E: growth\nRationales: Since the context asks for a synonym of the term \"improvement\", the options given are words that have similar or alternate meanings to the word \"improvemnt\". These options are advance, enhancement, advancement, development, augmentation, and growth. \n1. First, let's analyze the question to identify the keyword \"improvement\". This implies, among other things, that whatever will be mentioned has undergone an improvement, hence must meet the criteria of being improved, as opposed to having a normal, non-improved, or worse quality.\n2. Let' s consider the options we were given and use our knowledge of words to rule out any incorrect answers. \na) Augmentation and enhancement both refer to adding something or increasing a value. However, improvement is about reducing the quality from poor to good or from bad to better. \nb) Advance means to move to a better position. This implies that improvements are made to the position itself, therefore is not applicable to the situation. Moreover, the keyword here is still \"development\", hence the answer must be a synonym of this word.\nc) Growth has no synonym. It is itself a type of development, therefore cannot be a synonym of the keyword \"development\".\nd) The answer must be C: developmnet because it is a synonym of \"development\".\ne) It should be interpreted as improvement occurs to something that is already developed or enhanced, meaning choice D: enhancement does not", "answer": " 11"}

The only option that we can conclude as a solution to the problem is the one that takes the least amount of additional effort to obtain food outside of hunting, and that option is D'E'(prepare to go').\n 8.

C: wedding, 4. D: party, 5. E: christmas.\nRationales: The question presents us with multiple options for a celebration which may be sad - namely a birthday, a vacation, a wedding, a party, or Christmas. \n1. From this, we can infer that there is more information present - i.e. that the subject of the question is the occasion, rather than who it is sad.\n2. This allows us to cross of all of the answers that are only defined by a type of person, and leave us with only the answers that do not have any context-specific information.\n3. Christmas is excluded since it is an out-of-context holiday. \n4. The same can be said for a wedding, a birthday, and a vacation, since they are unique to specific types of occasions. \n5. All that is left are party and Christmass since they are not connected to a specific event or purpose. \n6. Since there is nothing else to connect them to a specific occasion, the only option left is Christmas since parties tend to occur at certain occasions that are more often related to special events like a vacation, birthday, or wedding. \n7. Therefore, the best answer is Christmas.\nAnswer: E. Christmas\n\nInput: Who does not believe that the best kind of pizza is with crushed tom", "answer": " 2"}

Finally, we identify that the final choice E: prepare to go contains the most fitting description of the intended action.\n8. The neolithic time period involved a hunter-gatherer lifestyle where survival mainly relied on hunting animals for food. \n9. Therefore, a hunter-gathers would prepare equipment such as spears or traps ahead of time, to facilitate their hunt for food.

She was likely to be sad after the breakup because her boyfriend had what? Choices A: dumped me B: broke my Heart C: was not so romantic for  D: broken up\nAnalyze: From the choices given, there are two aspects present in the choice that cause sadness:\n1. Something romantic or emotional such as breaking up, heart break caused the girl\u2019s sadness; and\n2. Something negative such as being dumped which caused her anger.\n3.

Choices: \t A: A big party and cake B: A prize C: A good grade D: A good grade and cake E: A large reward\nRationales: This question asks us to answer based off of what it says in the options provided that the test taker does well on the test.\n1. The choices provided are A and B. These options are very similar in meaning, but \"a party and cake\" is not what a test taker will get for doing well.\n2. \"A prize\" sounds like that's what they might get based off of doing well but it does not guarantee it.\n3. Option C sounds more logical than B; however, it still is not an official reward.\n4. Finally, we consider Option E. This choice is describing a scenario where something much larger than \"a large reward\" is given.\n5. Option E's reward is so large that there is not only a \"good grade\", but also a \"cake and a party\".

So we need to consider all the possible locations to determine the location(s) where the person would go to receive appreciation.\n2. The different possible answers can be: a concert, a school, a wedding, a sports game, a party, or a place where the person works.\n3. These answers will be evaluated against the following criteria: \n4. \" Concerts are usually not places where people go to be appreciated, because the main concern at concerts is the performance itself, not the audience reactions.\n5. \" \"Weddings are usually occasions where people express their appreciation towards the couple, not necessarily towards anyone else in particular.\n6. \" \"Sports games are a possibility, where cheering from the crowd could come as a sense of appreciation for one's team\n7. \" A party is an occasion where people are likely to share their appreciation for their friends or family members.\n8. \" Going to work could potentially be a suitable location to feel appreciated, if the person works in a place where their effort is valued or appreciated. \n9.

Choice B: hunting for food doesn't seem to be necessary, since hunger doesn't specify when the person would be eating. However, it could be related to Choice C: feeling humiliated. Perhaps, the person's dehydration, weakness, or sickness was a result of being hungry and lacking food, and therefore, the person felt humiliated about not having food to eat.\n7. The rationale above is supported by the passage, which states that the neolithics had to hunt for food.\n8. Additionally, hunger leads to weakness, illness, and even death in extreme cases, so a person will likely feel humiliated from having little or nothing to eat.\n9.

Given the context of the question and the actions given, one can infer that hunting for food has the best chance of resolving this problem. \n9. Thus, the answer is C.\nAnswer: C. hunting for food \n\nInput:  While going for a walk, Alex's dog ran into some kangaroos, he was so excited. The boy said what? Choices: A: Woof B: Arf C: Wuff D: Rug E: Muff\nRationales: First of all, we identify what Alex the boy did when he saw the kangaroos. \n1. He was so excited. Excitement is something that happens inside the boy since he was inside the dog's body. The dog's body would not feel excitement.\n2. He said what? So we have to find the only thing that the boy says and what else he would say.\n3. The boy is inside the dog body; therefore, the boy can say only this: \"Woof\".\n4. Choices B and D are only variations of the word \"Woof\". They are different words with the same meaning. We cannot differentiate between B and D when they have the same meaning as the correct answer.\n5. Choices A, C and E only have variations of the word \"woof\". There should be a different word as the correct choice because \"woof\" is not the only choice.\n6. Thus, the answer of the question would be \"Woof\". \nAnswer: A. Woof\n\nInput:  The teacher said to Tracy, \"Stand up straight!\" But she didn't like that, because her legs are 60 centimeters long, and she would", "answer": " 25"}

Choices:  B: theme D: subplot C: tone F: symbol\nRationales: The question provides an opportunity for the candidates to demonstrate their knowledge of the elements of a story, specifically, themes and what they are.\n1. Theme refers to an underlying idea or message or the main message a story is trying to convey to its readers.\n2. Subplot refers to a secondary plotline or event that helps to develop the main plot or theme of a story.\n3. Tone refers to the speaker\u2019s voice or attitude toward a subject in writing, for example, satire, sarcasm, or seriousness.\n4. Symbols refer to object, event or person in a story that stands for another thing, such as meaning or character trait. For example, a tree symbolizes wisdom or strength and a spider represents a villain.\n5. To get the answer to the question, the candidates need to understand the difference between the theme, tone, subplot, symbol and focus, which is crucial in terms of the story\u2019s meaning.\n6. The tone of the story is not the theme. It is related to the overall mood of the story, that is, the author's attitude towards a particular subject, situation or event. \n7. Symbols are not the same as the theme. Symbols are objects, events, or persons that represent or stand for something else, e.g., the villain, a tree or flowers.\n8.

Choices:  a: no, because that was the wrong time b: no, because of a different reason c: no, because it's at a different stadium d: no, because the weather is different e: yes, definitely\nRationales: Looking for an accurate answer requires an understanding of the specifics of the problem. \n1. The first thing to know is whether the two problems are the same or not. To do so, you need to identify any distinctions between them. \n2. \"Is the problem the same as last year's one\" can be rephrased as \"are all parameters of both problems identical\". \n3. This means that this problem must have the same year (2024), location (the Olympics), and competition (at a stadium). \n4. Choices B and C will not work since the year and location are different from last year.\n5. Choices A and D will not work either; a stadium is not part of the problem. The parameters are the same only the weather is different, the temperature in the last year during Olympic games was cool, but it usually is not the case this year, and that makes the problem different. \n6. Therefore, this problem is the same as last year and the only correct answer is E \"yes, definitely.\"\nAnswer: E: yes, definitely.\n\nInput: The person is always sad, what does she need to do?

Choice E: sleep is unlikely to help when one is hungry, although it is natural to be tired at the end of a long day. \n7. There are two choices left: hunting for food and feeling humiliated, let us examine these more closely.\n8. Hunting for food means hunting wild animals or other living creatures to find them and kill them in order to obtain food.\n9. Feeling humiliated is an emotion which results in people feeling ashamed, usually due to a transgression, but it does not necessarily involve finding food.\n10. Therefore, the most reasonable solution for the neolithic man in the scenario described would be choice C: feel humiliation.\n11. Feeling humiliation would lead to anxiety and possibly depression, which would cause people to lose their appetite and not be able to digest their food.\n12. As a result, the neolithic might prepare to leave on a journey in an attempt to find food elsewhere, or they might pray to the gods; but eating the food they already had would not be an option unless they felt otherwise.\n13. Therefore, the answer to this question is B: hunt for the person they were trying to get away.\nAnswer: B: hunt for person\n\nInput: The answer to this math problem is a: 2/3 + 2/3 = 5/3.

But the problem has already arisen, so there would be no real time to perceive that there was a need for food.\n6. Choice D can be eliminated because while sleeping can be a solution to restoring energy, it doesn't immediately result in the procurement of sustenance. \n7. Finally, choice E: prepare to go is the only solution that would likely result in the procuremen of food. The word \"prepare\" connotes putting effort in the procurement process, whether by gathering and preparing one's resources or taking steps to find them.\n8.

In the question, graduates have a choice amongst the given options to study abroad during college.\n2. However, they consider studying abroad the most difficult choice, which means they prefer other options over choosing this option.\n3. For this, we need to determine reasons why they consider this difficult if there aren't any problems related to language barriers, visas, health insurance, or difficulty finding a job.\n4.

Choices: 1. A: blood sweat and tears B: a beautiful smell C: bad thoughts D: its stink E: its perfume\nRationales: We know a skunk's primary sense organ is its nose, which allows it to detect nearby predators by scent.\n1. This indicates that the animal produces a very foul odor to keep animals from approaching it.\n2. The skunk's smelly spray is usually used as a last-ditch effort to defend itself from predators, because it can harm anyone who comes near it.\n3. We can thus say that a skunk's perfume does the opposite of a human's perfume; instead of attracting people, it turns people away, so a smell would act as a de-facto perfume for a skunk.\n4. There are two possible choices given in the choices: \"beautiful smell\" and \"bad thoughts\". While the animal can have a musky smell, it is not an enticing one, however, this is not the primary function of the odor as it is a deterrent. \n5. Therefore, a \"perfume\" or pleasant smell does not do the job for a skunk, hence the answer is \"its stink\", not \"its perfume\".\nAnswer: E. Its stink\n\nInput: Do monks still use the 53-foot abacus?

We can eliminate these from the list.\n7. Therefore Options B: hunt for the food, D: sleep, and E: prepare to go are the only options left. \n8. Choice B: hunt for a meal implies proactivity and thus has a high likelihood of leading to food finding.\n9. While the sleep option may be needed to recover energy levels for future meal searching, a simple nap is unlikely to help achieve this. \n10. Choice E: prepare to go emphasizes the preparative actions that would have occurred before the neolithic man or woman went out to be food. These actions include packing and perhaps gathering water for travel. This is similar to Choice D but does so in a more direct fashion. This can also lead to finding food on a more direct level.\n11. Hence, the answer would likely be Choice D: prepare to go, which encompasses the actions of Choices B: hunting for food and E: preparation. \n12. Option D: prepare to go would also lead to the finding of food as the next steps of the neolithic population after preparing to go would include leaving home and exploring. \n13.

This implies that the solution is preparing a plan, or taking some sort of action in order to address the problem. \n8. In this case, the neolithic hunter-gatherer made a plan to gather food by deciding to go on the hunt.\n9.

Choices: A: was a coworker B: organized the office supplies C: got you a birthday cake D: was an employee that had a happy birthday E: took an exam\nRationales: Firstly, we will look at the context of the question.\n\nWe see that the question is giving us the context of an office in which the manager would like to give a gift. \nThey then go on to say how you (the boss) could tip the manager. This implies that the manager is going to present a gift to the staff member.  \n\nThe manager would have been organising in the office supplies to prepare such activity. \n\nSo, the best action to tip the manager is A: was a co-worker. \n\nAs it has all been explained above, the best answer option for this question is B: organized the office supply. \n\nAnswer: B: organized the office\n\nInput: It's time for dinner.

Choice D: sleep is also an appropriate reaction to being hungry, and it would require no action if it is simply for the purposes of falling asleep, but we want to narrow down the choices to those with direct actions.\n7. Of the remaining choices, only choice E: Prepare to go, mentions any action of how the person would be going to solve the problem, which is directly related to finding food. \n8.

Choices: A: pets B: food D: decoration E: both\nRationales: This question is about the different species  of iguana and what they are often used for.\n1. 2000 is too large a number for the population or quantity of something to be referred to as \"small\", unless other information in the question indicates that they are in small numbers such as a very small subpopulation or a small group.\n2. Therefore, small is not the correct answer.\n3. While over 200 species of igauna could be used as a pet, it is not the only possible use for them. The other possible uses of such a large number of species are as food, decoration and both.\n4. Option D: Food, is the only choice that could be used to describe the iguana in its entirety because all of the animals of the family could be consumed, while the other options are more restrictive as either they are only for what is selected, or in the case of option B: pets, they are not food.\n5.

Choice C is incompatible with the purpose of the question which is to identify a solution to hunger.\n7. Choice E may initially seem like a potential solution by indicating the person is preparing to go for food. However, we can rule this out based on context clues from the question.\n8. The question states that the problem is for a neolithic person who \"wants to find food so they don't die in the snow\" which means they are not well-equipped to find food and that they are likely to die if not fed. This implies that they must leave their house.\n9.

Moreover, it does not directly relate to food procurement. \n8. Choices D and E: sleeping and preparing to go are both reasonable options for a person who is hungry, but there is no explicit description of the situation such as being in a dangerous environment where food is scarce.\n9. For this scenario and description, both options D and E would be highly plausible options for the hungry neolithic person. \n10. Moreover, preparing to go might involve preparing some food with what might be available. So choice D might imply preparing food, which would be the most applicable option for us to mark as the answer. \n11.

The answer choice implies that they are not sleep deprived, which disqualifies it as a viable answer.\n6. Hence, the answer has to be the remaining 3 choices: C: feels humiliated, E: prepares to go, and D: Hunts for food.\n7. Choice C: feels humiliates conveys an emotional response to the hunger rather than a solution. Hence, this is not a way to solve the problem.\n8. Choice E: prepares to travel does not require an explanation to get food, as it is common sense to go to places where food is sold.\n9. This leaves Choice D: Hunts for Food.

Choices B (hunting for food) and C (feeling humiliated) could be considered in this respect.\n7. Humiliating oneself could indirectly find a food source, but this approach would be dangerous and probably lead to the eventual death of the person.\n8.

Choices A: cooking B: baking C: art D: poetry E: carpentry\nRationales: The question contains two pieces of information: The book is a \"how-to\"; The given options are either art, poetry, cooking, baking, or carpentry.\n1. The fact that the book is a how-TO leaves us with the idea that it is a type of manual or guide.\n2. But, it still remains unclear as to what the book is a guide to.\n3. This is why we need to look into the options for clues.\n4. Cooking and baking are most likely ways to make food; however this would mean that the book is a guide for \"what to eat\". \n5.

The final option, Choice E: \"prepare to go\", suggests that an action would be taken to prepare for the future, but it does not directly say what this action would be.\n8. Based purely on the presented information, the most logical answer is C: feel humiliation, as it presents the idea of a person who is starving, which is the most extreme form of hunger.\n9. Furthermore, feeling humiliated suggests that the person will do anything to find food, even if it means sacrificing their pride. \n10. This is consistent with the person's situation of being hungry, which emphasizes the need for food over other considerations.\nAnswer: C.

We also know that sugar can cause weight gain, which can further exacerbate the condition of diabetes.\n5. If we look at the options provided, all of them seem to have something to do with sugar.\n6.

Choice C: feeling humiliated is not an option that the person would choose because hungry people are generally more than willing to work/labor to find food for themselves.\n8.

In other words, we need to understand what the contextual meaning is to know what the word \"for best results\" actually refers to.\n   2.

Thinking, in this case, can be a constructive process and can help him make better decisions and find solutions to his problems. \n3. The question gives us another clue in the end that he hasn't done everything, when it says, \"he didn't get him (i.e. help him) anywhere.\"\n4.

Choices:  A.  A verb. B.  Glossy word. C.  Glossy noun. D.  Glossy use. E.  Glossy part of speech.\nRationales: The entire question is based on words, their meanings, and their use.\n1. It is important to look at the words first.\n2. \"single word\" may be taken as an adjective or a noun, \n3. then the phrase \"when used as a noun\" would indicate that we should think of it as noun.\n4. The word proliferation may refer to \"the process of becoming noticeably larger, more numerous or more prominent (Cambridge University Press). Since we need to consider the words here, we should only deal with the word \"proliferation.\" \n5. The question then asks us what the proliferation means. This can be explained as the growth, enhancement or expansion.\n5. Based on these considerations, the meaning of proliferation is to have some things expand or enhance. \n6. The words that follow, used as a noun refer to something's physical form or characteristic.\n7. Based on what we've already identified, the only word that fits this role as a noun is \"form.\"\n8.

But to find the bookmark later on, the user would likely have to choose what from the bookcase? Choices: 1) Title 2) Color 3) Author 4) Date 5) ISBN\nRationales:\n1. The question is about how a person would find and access a bookmark that they stored previously.\n2. This is done by referring to the characteristics of the bookmark.\n3. A bookmark stores specific information in its attributes such as the title, color, author, and date. It is possible (albeit less likely) that the bookmark could also store the ISBN number of the book.\n4. But the purpose of this question is to describe the likely options that would allow the user to reference the bookmark at a later time.\n5. In order to determine the most probable options, we first eliminate the choices that are less likely.\n6. The choice that is least likely is for the bookmark to store an ISBN. This is because an ISBN identifies a specific book, not a specific bookmark. Bookmarks do not have their own ISBN. \n7. The second least likely choice is for the bookmark's date because the purpose of a bookmark is to help remember or access a specific book. Dates do not describe a specific book, but rather, they describe a general timeline. \n8. Another less likely choice is the bookmark's color. Although possible, the color", "answer": " 58"}

However, as part of the answer's explanation, the question states that the individual was a hunter and gatherer. This means they had the capability and skills necessary to hunt for food, they were just not satisfied with their food supply.\n6. Choice D: sleeping is not what an individual should do when they are hungry. They need to actively search for food.\n7. Choice E: preparing to go indicates that someone is getting ready for a journey. This is not directly relevant to solving the problem outlined in the question, which pertains to getting food.\n8. Thus, the most apt solution is choice B: hunting for food. It allows the person to solve their problems related to not-having-enough-food.\n9. Hunting itself involves multiple actions which include stalking, ambushing, disabling, and killing.\n10. Therefore, choices B, C, D, and E must be rejected because they do not refer to hunting specifically.\n11. And that leaves hunting as the only action to solve the problem.

The answer must be consistent with the provided options, B: Field and C: pumpkin is the only suitable options as it has to describe a place where corn is grown.\n\n2. A farmer could not grow grain, a wheat crop in a field or pumpkin.  Grains are legume crops, such as wheat, barley, and oats, whereas pumpkins are a type of gourd.\n\n3.

The feeling of humiliation would not necessarily motivate one to hunt for food and sleep would not be practical. \n8. Therefore, choice D: prepare to go seems like the best choice to find a solution to the problem of finding food for a neolithic person who is hungry. \n9. Hence, the answer choice is D: prepare to go.\nAnswer: D prepare to go.\n\n### Example:\nInput: John, whose nickname is \"Fish\", likes fishing, but he wants to be known for what? Choices: A: his fishing skills. B: his knowledge of fish. C: being smart. D: his personality. E: knowing about different fish\nRationale: 1. John's nickname is \"Fishing\"\n2.

Choice C: feeling humiliated is also not sufficient for solving the problem as it is not a tangible means to acquire nourishment and it is likely to cause unnecessary stress and anxiety.\n6. Choice B: hunt for some food is a good solution as it involves physically searching for food in the environment, which has a high probability of success as long as it is done properly. \n7. Next, we examine choice D, which is sleep. \n8. Sleep reduces hunger at the physiological level, however, it is ineffective at solving the problem of hunger in society. Hunger is a social problem of having an inadequate amount of food or nourishing substances.\n9. Therefore the person needs to actively search for food or nourishment to find a solution to the problem. \n10. Consequently, the answer is E, in which the person needs to prepare to go out and look for food because it is the most probable action that will result in him having enough food to solve the problem.\nAnswer: E. prepare to go\n\nInput: Dad has been working and making money all day, he has enough money saved so he now knows what his next mission is.

Similarly, choices B (hunt for food), D (sleep) and E (prepare to go) are not viable actions that a person hungry for food should undertake.\n6. Although it may seem counterintuitive, the correct answer to get the person food is choice C: Feel humiliated. \n7. The goal of this solution is for the person to induce shame to make someone who has extra food give it to them. Humiliation and shame are emotionally charged reactions that can drive action in others, resulting in a solution that gives the person what they need.\n8. Although it may seem morally dubious, this action is necessary to get the person food. This solution is only for situations where people have gone beyond traditional means of procuring food and require a novel strategy to address hunger.\n9.

D: concern E: care \nRationales: The opposite of love is hate.\nWhen a person feels love, he has strong feelings, emotions, and desires toward another person. On the other hand, when a person feels hate, he has strong feelings toward another person that are the opposites of love. Hate may include feelings of anger, dislike, revenge, or aversion. A person who hates other persons may feel intense emotions toward them such as hatred or intense dislike.\nHate does not necessarily mean the loathing or intense dislike of others. For example, it may involve only a strong sense of intense antagonism toward others.\nHate as an emotional response has been researched by psychologists in the United States. Research by psychologist Robert L. Levenson in the 1980s and 1990s led to the development of the \"Hotel California\" model of hate, also known as the cognitive-emotional hierarchy, which was developed as a model of the intensity and complexity of hate.\nHate can have a significant positive impact on decision-making, according to one 2015 study, resulting", "answer": " 23248"}

It asks us about the term \u201cvote to reject\u201d.\n1. The new school lunch menu is an example of an idea, and the students' reaction is also an idea.\n2. So, the students will choose either to accept or reject the new school lunch.\n3. \u201cA vote to reject is a\u201d follows the sentence \u201cEveryone must give their personal\u201d\n\n4. Because the school lunch is a product where we can buy it or reject it, \u201cvote to reject\u201d is a term which we use to accept or reject the product.\n5. So the choice is an example of \u201creject\u201d and \u201coverturn\u201d.\n6. \u201cA vote to accept is an indication\u201d\n7. \u201cTo accept\u201d is used to show us that we\u2019re accepting or not rejecting the new school lunches menu.\n8.

Choices: 1: Why is the tiger so wet? 2: Why is the mouse so wet? 3: This river is horrible! I want out! 4: I want out! \nRationales:1. The question is about the different thoughts the lion, the tiger, and the mouse may have.\n2. In this scenario, the tiger and the mouse are crossing the river along with the lion.\n3. A lion is a wild animal which represents aggression, while a tiger represents the instinct to hunt and a mouse represents fear.\n4. The three might think differently in the scenario.\n5. The lion might think of the river as 'horrible' due to its dangerous nature and its inability to be crossed safely.\n6. The lion's feeling might suggest animosity towards the other animals, especially the mouse.\n7. The lion might also think of how the tiger is getting wet, while the mouse is dry.

Furthermore, in most cases, one lacks the ability to influence or affect divine events or supernatural phenomena. There are no logical and sufficient reasons to infer that prayer is a proper way to find food.\n7. Hence option A: thank god is discarded as a feasible answer.\n8. Next, we look at choice B: hunt for/seek food. This suggests that the person needs to procure food themselves rather than wish or pray for it.\n9. Choice D: sleep is a logical possibility as the person has been doing so to conserve energy. However, this does not ensure they will still have enough energy to actually find food and prepare it for themselves. In addition, falling asleep and failing to find food would not make the person able to go out and hunt in the future, but rather would make them more hungry when they wake up. Therefore, the option D: sleep is also invalid as a solution to their problem.\n10. Finally, we arrive at choice E: prepare to go. This option is not specified, but it is reasonable to assume that a neolithic person does not have the tools necessary to get food if they were to go out and look for it themselves. It could be reasonable to conclude they are hungry because they do not have any other means of getting food except from going out, hunting, and then preparing it. Conversely, they may not have any food because they cannot afford it or because there is none to be found because they live in an area that is suffering from drought or famine. \n11. Moreover, choice E: prepare to get out also makes sense because the person previously tried sleeping in order to find energy, which did not lead to finding food. However, preparing to go may simply refer to preparing themselves such as putting on protective clothing or getting some tools, in which case they have no guarantee they will find any food. In addition, preparing themselves may not be an effective strategy for locating food. The person may be unable to find food even when they go out and look for themselves. \n12.

Choice C: feeling humiliated refers to experiencing shame or embarrassment. This can be a potential solution to the problem, but only indirectly: Feeling humiliated could cause a person to feel depressed and despondent, which may lead them to commit suicide or be in such a poor state that they would be vulnerable to starvation if they were to pass away. This line of reasoning is too far-fetched and makes it unlikely that this is the real culprit behind the starvation. \n6. Choiices B: hunt for fish and C: prepare to go could both be actions leading to the procurement (gathering) of food.\n7.

Choice D: prepare to go is probably the most plausible option for the person. They can prepare to go in a direction where they can find something to eat and find something that resembles a meal.\n9. The answer is therefore D: prepare to go.\nAnswer: D(Prepare to go).\n\nInput: It's easy to tell when a dog has what? Choices: A: fleas B: cancer C: rabies D: mange E: ringworm\nRationales: The question can be broken down into two main parts: to recognize a dog with what and what is easier to see than a dog with what?\n1. There are five different diseases listed that can affect a dog.\n2. Cancer, ringworm, and rabies can all cause symptoms such as hair loss, but only rabies has a definitive sign (fox-like appearance); therefore, rabies is the only choice which allows the person to recognize a dog which has a disease quickly.\n3. Mange is also one of the diseases listed.\n3. Mage produces baldness, however, the question doesn't make reference to a dog that looks like that to which you can respond with \"It's easy to tell that a dog has mage\", but instead talks about diseases that are \"easier to spot\" than some other condition that isn't mentioned.\n4. Cancer, ring worm, and mange are not diseases with unique, definitive symptoms.\n5. In conclusion, cancer, ring worm, or mange can't be the", "answer": " 6"}

Hunger usually causes one to focus on survival and self-preservation, rather than humiliation.\n6. Finally, we are left with alternatives A & B.\n7. While it may be possible for a person to try to hunt or seek food for themselves, especially in rural areas or environments where resources are abundant, this approach might not work in situations where resources are scarce. Similarly, in situations where food is scarce, it would be unlikely that a person would prepare to go to a different location for food.\n8.

A plow is considered a hard-working tool as it works hard plowing or breaking the soil for plantations. \n6. In order to be able to answer the question correctly, we need to know what a plow is best used for. Looking at the answer choices given, we can determine that only one option is the best possible outcome or answer choice.\n7.

Feeling humiliated does not relate to overcoming hunger as it only deals with feelings. \n9. This leaves us with choice C: feel humiliating, which is what we seek.\n10. To feel humiliated is to experience a strong sense of shame or embarrassment.\n11. Embarrassment has to do with social relationships which indicates that the person feels the need to find food with other people.\n12.

None of these options refer to an electric light or an angel that sends rainbows. In this context, the answer will be an electric light or a cloud. We can reject \"e\" because the answer does not refer to any kind of an angel or celestial being. For this reason, we can reject c, d, e, f. Option a refers to electric light (as a kind of an electric light is assumed to be a human innovation). For this reason, we now consider just a, b and c. There is nothing about clouds that suggests that they are rainbows, so clouds should be ruled out. We can now discard c because the sun is assumed to be the source of the rainbow.

From here on we will assume the diagram is available and examine other data in the question to provide context;\n\n1. The diagram should have at least four main quadrants labelled as the north, the east, the south and the west of the United States.\n2. The questions asks for the \"biggest\" population of people \"interested\" so this suggests that only people who plan to travel to somewhere will be considered. The question does not ask if people will travel to the northeast or not and thus this option is ineligible.\n3. Among the other options available to us, choice B: to the east is likely to be the most appropriate as the question was looking for the biggest population.\n4.

Therefore, it can be excluded from the list of possible solutions. \n7. In choice D: sleep, the person is instructed to \"prepare to go\" which means they have to be ready to look for food. This can include sleeping and resting to be able to walk longer distances.\n8. This implies that the correct action to take would be the same as what Choice D tells us to do. Also, Choice A: thank god can be considered a similar action to this. However, Choice C: feel humiliation does not fall within the same category.\n9. While choice E: prepare to go might be an option, it does not explicitly state the person intends to find food. Therefore, it can also be excluded from the options.\n10. Based on the reasoning in the above points, we can determine that the only remaining choices that are logical actions to take if we want to solve this problem would be to choose either to thank god or to go looking for food. As both of those options are equally viable, the answer is either one. \n11. Choice A: Thank god could be the correct answer since the question doesn't provide any further information or details about whether their efforts are successful.

First, we should identify the keyword of this question and the question type by searching for them in the question and seeing where they are positioned.\n2. In this instance, \"2 days\" is not a keyword but it's a part of the question. This can be found by seeing where the numbers are positioned. \n3. They are in the middle of the sentence; therefore they are not a keyword.\n4. In fact, \"2 days\" appears twice in the question; the second time is a part of a list of other possible answers rather than an actual question. \n5. Therefore, the keyword of the question is \"explain\", which directly impacts the answer.\n6. In this instance, we have to deduce that any form of explanation from Sally cannot be complete.\n7. This means that \"2 days\" will be used as a reference point to compare the length of the explanation (2 days) and the length of the explanation she is capable of giving (1-3 days). \n8. As a result, the length of the explanation the person needs is dependent on whether or not this person is capable of giving a more detailed explanation in fewer than 2 days.\n9. Therefore (2) (days) is the correct answer because (2 days is less", "answer": " 18"}

The action of hunting for food in choice B or simply preparing to go in choice E are out of the question, as those options imply that the neolithi person has not yet found food and is on the verge of starvation.\n6. Choice D: sleep would also be ineffective because it is not an action designed to solve an immediate problem and the person would likely wake up hungry anyway.\n7. Therefore the only remaining action that matches these criteria is C: feel humiliation.\nThis is because the person is feeling humiliated which would motivate them to act proactively and hunt wild animals in search of food.  \n8. So the answer is C: feel humiated.\nAnswer: C Feel Humiliated\n\nInput: She saw a man with a _____________ shirt, which was a good thing for her because she had no money. Choices:  A. dirty B. expensive C. new D. bright E. long\nRationales: Choice B: expensive is one the choices provided because it fits the given word, and its meaning matches the context. It is stated that She saw a man with an expensive shirt, which indicates that it was a good thing or a beneficial development for her in the situation because she had no money and had been searching for work. The man, who was wearing an expensive shirt, could offer her potential employment, perhaps paying money to work for him.  Therefore, the answer is B: Expensive.\nAnswer: B: Expensive\n\nInput: There is no one who can _____________ what I know for certain.

In addition, this choice seems to be describing an outcome rather than an action, making it inappropriate for the question.\n6. Choice B: finding food cannot be the action of hunt. It would be the goal of the action hunt. So B makes no sense.\n7. Choice C: feeling humiliated does not seem to have anything to do with obtaining food.\n8. Choice D: sleep is not an answer to the problem of hunger, which is likely to be very urgent.\n9. Hence, choice E: preparing to go is the only possible solution to the problem of hungering.\n10. The neolithic individual would hunt for food, which involves preparing for the effort involved in finding food.\n11. Since preparing to go cannot be the action, which is looking for food, the answer choice is D: preparing to go.\nAnswer: D : preparing to go\n\nInput: In this sentence, \"The people\" should be changed to \"People\", what does this mean? Choices: 1: The sentence must be in the present tense 2: The sentence is a sentence fragment 3: The sentence has a grammatical error 4: This is a run on sentence 5: This is a fragment 6: The sentence needs a pronoun\nRationales: Looking at the choices given for the answer, it is necessary to go through them carefully and evaluate their validity.\n1. First, we examine choice 1, The sentence must be in present tense. This option does not really make much sense as this sentence is not one that expresses an act that is happening in the present.\n2. Similarly, choice 2, The sentence is a sentence-fragment, could not make sense as this sentence is a relatively long one, with 19 words.\n3. In addition, choice 3, The senternce has a grammatical eror, does not make sense as this choice implies that the given sentence is incorrect grammatically, when it is actually perfectly normal grammatically.\n4.

Furthermore, the neolithic period refers to a time when people were beginning to transition from a hunting and gathering lifestyle to an agricultural life. \n8. Since farming and planting had not yet begun, hunting and gathering would've been the preferred way to procure food.\n9.

Options A-C state how to light up the area when electricity is lost, but the baker will still need some source of electricity to power appliances such as the oven, refrigerator, fryers, blenders, etc. \n3. Option D, to ask the customers to leave, will not be practical, as that is where the baker will continue his work.\n4. Option E, use a gas powered gas powered generator, is not feasible as gasoline generators are not always available for purchase.\n5.

{"text": "since there is no way to know whether it will lead to food or not.\n5. Choice A: hunt for food does make sense, since a solution to the problem is the acquisition of food, so it is possible that hunting can lead to food. \n6. However, since there is no other information about where the food is or how to procure it, we cannot say that hunting is definitely the answer.\n7. Choice B: feel humiliated is unlikely to be a solution for a food scarcity problem.\n8. Choice D Sleep is a logical solution for hungry people, it might help them rest and prepare for better solutions in the future.\n9. Although Choice E: prepare to go out sounds like the most logical solution, it's not necessarily the case. It may be possible to go hunting, find food, and then return home.\n10. Therefore, among the choices presented, hunt for food seems to be the one that is most fitting for the neolithic people.\n11.

Choices:  P: A little  Q: Alot  R: Quietly  S: Slowly\nRationales:  1. The question gives a description of the tragedy Mr Z experienced. His son died, which is a great loss that can leave people devastated and sad. \n2. The options given are responses that can be appropriate to the tragedy or that are similar to the feelings experienced by the person who is grieving.\n3. From the provided information, the options that best match the description given are P: a little or Q: alot since death is a huge loss, that many people don't experience in a lifetime.\n4. If Mr Z felt the loss of his son so greatly then maybe he would cry a lot. However, crying a lot or feeling very upset might not be appropriate for someone like Mr Z who is said to be calm, quiet, and patient. He may simply take time to mourn and grieve.\n5.

Choices A: job promotions B: workplace violence C: better morale D: poor quality E: better pay\nRationales: Lack of a good work ethic at a place of work could lead to a variety of negative results, including job dismissals, demotions, poor quality, and even violence, though there are other possibilities. \n1. The phrase \"lack of a work ethic\" could be vague and is commonly used to refer to someone having a poor work ethic, which is an issue for the company. \n2. Out of all the options, the answer needs to be the one that best fits the scenario described.\n3. The only option that fits the context is the \"better pay\" because a job with better pay would be the best compensation for job dismissal and demotions.\n4.

Choice D: sleep is an option but, given the choice of the words \"neolithic person\" we presume this would be a temporary option to survive. \n8.

Choice D: sleeping would not be a suitable course of action as it doesn't provide an immediate solution. \n6. Of the remaining choices: E: prepare to go or C: feel humiliation, the first option is not an action that can be taken to find food so we can rule that out. \n7. However, the second option of feeling humiliated would involve some sort of preparation, which might help the person to find food or secure more food for the next time that they are hungry.\n8.

A mother's love B. The human body C. The world D. A flower E. An apple\nRationales: First, we need to find the subject in which the author is writing about.\n2. The poem begins with the line \"Hardly aware.\" so the author might be referring to the subject that is aware.\n3. From this phrase, we can infer that the author is referring to the mind. \n4. We can identify what is aware or conscious in this context through the adjective \"hardly,\" which indicates a state of limited awareness.\n5. Thus, \"hardly aware\" can suggest that the mind is not completely aware or conscious of all its thoughts, ideas, emotions, or sensations.\n6. The main subject is the mind which is not entirely aware of its own miraculous processes or abilities.\n7. This gives us the opportunity to explore the different concepts that relate to the mind and consider what might be considered miraculous in this context. Here we can think about various aspects of the self including the mind, body, world, etc.\n8. From this context, we can assume that the stanza might suggest that the mind is the miracle in the poem.\n9. Based on the reasoning and available choices, we can conclude that the author might be describing the", "answer": " 6"}

In fact, choice A could be an effect of the problem, as God may have sent the person food when they thanked him for being blessed.\n6. Choices B (hunt for food) and D (sleep) are both actions that could involve the procurement of meat, but without any indication of when and by whom, it's unclear what actually went into the solution.\n7. Choice C (feel humiliated) is an emotion, which does not contribute to solving the problem. \n8. However, choice E (prepare to go) clearly shows that the act of leaving the area and traveling could lead to obtaining food. \n9. Prepared-to-go implies that the person is ready to travel. This suggests that they intend to travel and may even have a plan regarding where the food is likely to be. Therefore, the action that best fits the description of solving the problem is choice E, prepare to go. \n10. Moreover, this choice is also the most effective option because the hunter is not waiting around their home and therefore, will be less likely to starve if food doesn't show up. \n11. The wording of \"their\" solution may refer to the neolithic culture as a whole and not the individual who needs the food.\n\nInput: The man's problem was he didn't finish doing something, but he was too busy to be more precise.

Instead, he may have simply been procrastinating.\n\n1. Therefore, it's relevant to look for actions that indicate he was actually resolving something.\n2.

Choice D: sleeping might contribute to solving the problem indirectly since not getting enough sleep might lead to hunger. However, this option does not mention directly finding food and is not applicable due to the question describing the neolithic period, in which the invention of sleeping was not possible.\n7.

The answer choices are in alphabetical order, indicating that they should be reasonably related in some way.\n3. It can be deduced that the character is a small animal, such as a mouse, cat, goose, etc. since cartoon characters are usually exaggerated and/or drawn larger than real animals, leading to an implication that a mouse is not a suitable answer. \n4. As for B: bear, C: cat and E: goose option, each of them has their own characteristics and thus do not relate to the main character of the movie in this regard.\n5. D and E are possible answers since they both refer to animals that are small and relatively docile in real life, yet somewhat exaggerated in cartoons.\n6.

Therefore the answer must be choice C which is feeling humiliated. The fact that the person felt humiliated suggests that he or she took some form of action to solve the problem, i.e. procuring food.\n8. This solution matches the question because the neolithic people did not possess the technology or expertise to hunt animals or grow their own crops.\n9.

Choice Money is too general. Although Sam may have lost money, a mishap or mistake will not necessarily cost him money.\n2. Option Time is also too broad. The question specifically mentions instances where Sam lost time, not the amount of time spent on one event.\n3. Choice Health is not applicable to the context of the question, as mishaps or mistakes will most likely not affect one's health in a negative way.\n4.

Choices: A: driving B: riding with Uber C: public transportation D: carpooling E: car rental\nRationales:1. The question asks about which solution would people prefer because they hate taxis.\n2. In the context of taking a taxi, the word \"hate\" implies that the act itself is something undesirable. \n3.

Option B: hunting for food is a logical choice since it would involve seeking, finding, and obtaining food, which would satisfy the person's hunger.\n6. Similarly, Choices C: \"feel humiliated\" and D: \"sleep\" are not suitable because they do not directly impact the solution either.\n7. The option that best fulfils the needs of the neolithic hunter is Choice B: hunt for the food.\n8. Therefore, \"hunt for food\" is the best possible solution the person could take to find something to eat.\nAnswer: B: hunt for an african animal\n\nInput: When you're biking and you encounter icy roads, you should wear what? Choices: A protective leggings B a helmet C a sweater D sweatpants E bike shorts\nRationales: Here's what we have to figure out: When you're going biking, if you encounter icy roads which can be slippery, what should you wear?\nFirst, we identify which of the given choices is the most suitable for the scenario. In this context, when facing icy roads while biking, wearing a helmet only protects the head, no part of the body. Helmet protects head alone, leaving out all the other body parts, namely arms, chest, legs, etc., which can be injured or hurt in case of mishap, fall, etc.\nChoices are A) protective leggings, B) a helmet, C) a sweater, D) sweatpants, and E) bike shorts.\nBased on the question and context, D) sweat pants can be ruled out because its purpose is mainly to keep you warm, which may or may not be important or useful in the given scenario.\nAs A) protective leather pants seem to have more protection than other apparel, they are the best choice, for what they are worn for. A lot of other factors may be involved, like weather, temperature, other protective gear, etc.\n\nAnswer: I chose D: Sweat pants. Which is correct?", "answer": " 375000"}
{"text": "that directly results in food being consumed, in fact, it's a prayer. Choice B: hunt for some food would solve the hunger if it's successful. Choice C: feel humiliation is an emotion of disappointment or rejection, and not necessarily a solution to the problem. Choice D: sleep doesn't solve the problem but postpones the problem. Choice E: prepare to go implies that the person intends to either leave and go to another place to find food or that he or she plans to take another route to procure nourishment.\n5. Based on the reasonings above, we can conclude A: hunt for food is the only viable option with a high likelihood of obtaining food and therefore the best solution to the problem.\nAnswer: A : hunt for food.\n\n### Question:\nPlease identify the main causes of unemployment in the USA. There are primarily four types of unemployment which are Seasonal, voluntary, frictional and cyclical. \nInput: The first type, seasonal is unemployment brought on by a lack of seasonal work, this could be the result of the wrong time of season to work or because a person is moving to a new city where they will have to seek more permanent employment. \nNext we move on to Voluntary unemployment which is caused when a prospective worker chooses to not work or chooses not to work in the type of job that they desired such as a particular field or location. \nNext we have the most common type of unemployment frictional, that is unemployment that occurs because there is a gap between the workers search for a job and the time between their leaving one and finding another. This type is usually a short-term issue and resolves itself rapidly. \nFinally, we have cyclical unemployment, in this type of unemployment  joblessness is a result of the economy entering a downturn in general as this often is a result of people losing their jobs and subsequently not being able to find others as quickly as those in peak economic times. \nAnswer: In America, we find there are primarily four different types of unemployment. These are seasonal,voluntary, frictional, and cyclical unemployement.\n### Instruction Answer the following question. A: If", "answer": " 9"}

Choice B: hunt for the food can be done in a variety of ways, like searching for wild game in the forest or growing crops in a field.\n7. These actions relate to the process of obtaining food in some way, and thus are possible solutions to the problem.\n8. Out of these options, growing crops fits the description the best by saying \"prepare to go\" is the correct answer.\n9. This statement indicates preparation and a possible action that may have been taken to feed the person.\n10.

The focus could be anything, and it could be different each time. The sentences do not provide more information about it. \nB. The sentence clearly says that the person was focused on something completely different than class. \nThe person was focused on something else, which distracted them from the task and resulted in the consequences mentioned. \nThe sentence does not provide more information about the focus and neither does it mention the focus several times. \nC.

Choice D: sleep is also not a viable solution to the problem as it doesn't lead to a concrete result or food.\n6. Choice B: hunt for a specific food is likely the correct answer because hunting is a technique used to find and acquire food.\n7. Although not necessary, it may be more appropriate to include E: prepare to go as a valid solution too, due to the fact that it would be a part of the process for someone to find the food they need.\n8.

In the question, the 6 letter word refers to the number six, not as an adjective or prefix.\n  2. As for the specific name of the number six, it can either be called \"six\" or \"sixer\".\n  3. There are no other six letter words than \"six\" and \"sixer\". Therefore, option A: 'Eight' is not an accurate choice for the 6 letter answer choice because there is no other six letter word other than six or sixer.\n  4. Likewise, no six letter words can be referred to as'six', option B: 'Nine' is not a correct choice either as it is a nine letter word.\n  5. The same goes for other number options D: 'Sixty' and E: 'Twelve': there are no other six letter-options than six or sixer, therefore these are also incorrect answers. Thus, the correct choice would be E: 'Six'.\nAnswer: E: six\n\nInput: What year did the first Olympic games take place? Choices: A: 1896 B: 1924 C: 1908 D: 1912 E: 1916 \nRationales For 1: \n1.

Bread, cheese, and fruit. b. Sandwich c. Meatball sandwich d. Cereal e. Tinned tuna fish\nRationales: (1) The question asks which food you should eat for breakfast to keep your energy levels high.\n(2) The question does not give any preference to specific types of breakfast. As a result, we can eliminate choice b as it is about making sandwiches.\n(3) It can be assumed that a marathon man needs to eat foods with high levels of protein. Therefore, it appears that choosing an option that has a high protein intake is a good choice to meet the requirement.\n(4) It can be inferred that the marathon man intakes protein by reading the previous parts.\n(5) Out of the options, choice B contains more protein than others.\n(6) Hence, the correct answer is a.

Choice B: hunt for any type of food may help but this option isn't detailed enough to show what steps the person is taking to ensure that the hunt is successful and ends up providing sufficient food.\n7.

From the age mentioned, it is evident that this person is old enough to understand death and the process of dying.\n5. They must believe in reincarnated life after death.\n6. The answers are the ages when they first believed in the reincarnated life.\n7. And among these five answers, 20 is the first age.\n8.

{"text": "as there is no indication of this being a religious practice or belief. \n5. It's important to note that the choices do not refer to specific types of food. They merely depict an action that can be used as a means for acquiring food. \n6. This is important because the question specifies that the person in question is neolithic which refers to an era in human history that is approximately 10,000 to 5,000 years ago. \n7. It was at this point in history that the first humans invented agriculture which involves the cultivation of plants with the aim of producing a surplus harvest.\n8. It would be unlikely that a hunter-gatherer who lived during this era would be aware of agriculture as it would not have been invented yet at the time.\n9. Therefore the only choices that are appropriate for an early hunter-gathering society are choices C: feel humiliation and E: prepare to go, as these represent actions that may lead to the procurements of food.\n10. Of the two actions given, feeling humiliation implies that a person would be willing to act in abject subordinance in order to procure food.\n11. This does not seem to be an option that would suit a person who is typically considered to be unsociable, rebellious, and selfish.\n11. Prepare to go, on the other hand, connotes a behavior that is less likely to obtain food, as it implies that one is on the way to leave and seek food elsewhere.\n12. A hungry hunter-gather community would be motivated to stay and obtain food from where they are, rather than traveling to other locations which requires lots of effort.\n13. It is also important to note that the behavior \"prepare to go\" could be an action that is taken in multiple situations. It's not limited to this specific context, where someone is facing a food scarcity and is actively trying to find something to eat.\n14. \"Prepare to go\" may also refer to a person leaving to hunt for food, gather water, collect materials for shelter, and so on.\n15.

Identify the keyword \"incident\"; this means that John will need to speak with someone about what happened to him.\n2. \"His boss\" must be the person who will discuss the incident, implying that he is in charge and responsible for managing the situation to resolve the incident.\n3. After discussing with his boss, John may need to go to someone for advice and treatment if his boss sends him to one of the choices: lawyer, doctor, therapist. \n4. From the options given, we can identify that John's boss cannot take him to the gym because it doesn't seem reasonable.\n5.

Choice B: hunt for something to eat seems like a good decision as hungry people usually search for food wherever it is available. \n7. Next, we look at Choice C: feel humiliation. Although feeling shame over being hungry is sometimes regarded as a sign of weakness, it is not likely to lead to solving the food problem. Moreover, it is only a feeling and cannot satisfy people's physical needs. \n8. Choice D: sleep. As the question mentions that the person is not feeling well, sleep is unlikely to be their only or immediate answer to their problem.\n9.

Choice I: \"French men are more aggressions at night than any other time of day\" does not seem to connect to the information provided in the question.\n4. Choice II: \"The subjects of the experiment are less or more likely to cheat during experiment\" is less likely because experimenting would involve more rules and regulations to ensure the safety of the experimental subjects and to obtain the desired result.\n\n###", "answer": " 117"}

I like movies with what? Choices: A: great twists B: great writing C: great stars D: a twist E: good acting\nRationales: The question is asking about what makes a movie good.\nIn order to answer the question, we need to identify the quality each choice represents. \n1. \"Great twists\" is not referring to the overall quality but to the plot twists and turns that occur in each movie\n2. \"Great writing\" does not refer to the quality of the movie but to the overall writing of the movie\n3. \"Great stars\" refers to the quality of the characters\n4. \"A twist\" refers to the quality that makes up a movie with a twist. Since only \"great twists\" is a choice referring to what makes a movie good as in the quality of the overall movie \n5. However, this quality of a twist in a movie is the same if a movie has a great twist or if a movie is great. It says that a movie has a great quality, not that the movie has a great twists.\n6.

The question doesn't mention that the person is skilled in hunting, or that they have the gear or sufficient resources to do so, so claiming that this is a potential solution is simply wrong.\n8. Finally, for all remaining choices, we compare and choose the option that is most specific to getting food, which is C: feel humiliate.\n9. This option conveys the fact that the person is going to have anxiety and feel distressed from being hungry and not having any way of obtaining food.\n10.

The person thought the invention was a car. \n3. The person also said he ran off around the world. \n4. So, the answer to the \"what did he do\" question is C: traveling. \n5.

Choices:  A  bad B  good C  truth D  true E  real\nRationales: The given options in this scenario describe how the girl feels and how she will react to the angry situation.\n1. We start with the main keywords: angry, tell, home, when and other relatives.\n2. First of all, we need to identify relevant information according to the question context to find out where the other relatives are.\n3. \"When she gets home\" indicates that the other relatives are not at her location now.\n4. Next, we need to analyze how the girl feels about the situation based on the keyword angry.\n5. Being angry means that she feels frustrated, hurt, or resentful.\n6. This indicates that she will share the details of the situation with other relatives.\n7. If we combine the information into one statement: The girl is angry and she tells other relatives the \"bad\" or \"truth\" when she gets home, we can understand that the girl shares a bad and unpleasant incident with her relative which she finds harmful to herself.\n8. Therefore, in this case, the right description of the girl's scenario is A: bad. The answer is B: bad.\nAnswer: B: bad \n\nInput: A frog is living the __________ of its life.

So between choice C, to feel humiliated, and E, to prepare to go, we cannot determine which one would more effectively lead to the person finding food to alleviate their hunger.\n9. This means if we exclude C and E from the options, we are left with A or B.  \n10.

What should the dog try doing? Choices:  B: growl C: leave D: whine E: bark\nRationales: The question states the dog is howling to attract the attention of the owner but does not get a response. \n1. If the dog does not get a response, it does not want to eat, sleep, or play, so it needs something more, that is to continue its howl. \n2. If we examine choice A and B, Growl and leave, they are similar. They imply that the dog gets the reaction it wants from the owner and then it continues to try something else. \n3. When answering options in this type of question, we can combine choices that perform similar actions. \n4. In regards to the actions of whine and bark, the dog still tries and receives a response. \n5. However, it doesn't seem reasonable that dog would bark to continue its howl as there is already one person at home. \n6. Therefore, it is better to combine whine and bark. \n7.

Choices: A: people are throwing away more B: companies are manufacturing junk C: it\u2019s your responsibility D: environmental concerns E: people are throwing away less\nRationales:  1. The question asks for a reason why garbage disposal has worsened. \n2. Looking at the choices, we consider what can be done with garbage, what can cause disposal of more garbage, and what environmental conditions lead to an increase in garbage.\n3. Choice A, \"people are throwing away more\", can be explained by the fact that it can be an individual behavior. \n4. But since disposal has gotten \"worse\", meaning people were already making a mess with it previously, then it's \"gotten worse\" because something else besides people throwing things away has changed.\n5. Choices B and D seem to indicate that the disposal situation has worsened because of external factors, meaning things external to an individual. Choice B implies that it's because of companies manufacturing junk to begin with, and choice D implies it's because of environmental concerns.\n6. However, the question specifically says that garbage disposal has been worsened recently, indicating the situation has gotten progressively worse recently. The word \"recently\" means that whatever has changed didn't happen suddenly.\n7. So, the answer must refer to a reason for garbage disposal to become worsened relatively quickly (such as within the past few years).\n8. Among the choices given, \"people are throwing less away\" can explain how the previous situation can rapidly transform from wasteful to environmentally-friendly in such a short time.

The government always makes the wrong decision. E. The tax on cheating will stop people from buying that food.\nRationales:\n1. The correct answer should focus on the government and its actions.\n2. Choice A: The sales tax will hurt poor people is incorrect. \n3. Choice B: The government is doing something wrong is incorrect.\n4.

Choices I: buns, II: muffins, and III: cookies are all referred to as breads. \n2. Choices IV: cakes and V: loaves, on the other hand, while they would most definitely be considered bread-related, would not be considered ingredients for the bread cost because they are not necessary needed for the baking process.\n3. The remaining choices are all referred to as \"other things\". \n4. Out of the given options, bread would definitely come from the four following ingredients: flour, water, salt, and yeast.\n5.

In the neolithic era, hunting alone was dangerous, so a solitary individual would not have been able to do this.\n6. Choice D: sleeping, while sometimes necessary for solving hunger, is not sufficient as the question mentions being hungry and alone. As a result, not being able to obtain immediate food from sleeping, someone might not last very long or survive at all without food.\n7. Finally, Choice E: preparing to go. This choice does not specify what needs to be done. Although it is plausible that preparation to go somewhere allows for obtaining food, it could mean a variety of things.\n8. Therefore, Choice E: prepare to go is not the answer as it does not directly relate to the procurement or acquisition of food. \n9. Thus, the answer is C, \"feel humiliated\".\n10. Feeling humiliated would cause the person to take action due to embarrassment or disappointment as seen in choices: D (hunt) and E (prepare).\n11.

Choices: A: action B: event C: phenomenon D: relationship E: interaction\nRationales: The question asks us a scenario where I ask someone for a pen and receive one. \n1. Interpreting \"if\" is to establish that an action is taking place in a certain conditions at a certain time.\n2. This action is asking for something, in this case, a pen.\n3. Receiving a pen can mean that action was completed successfully by the other person after hearing the question.\n4. Once the action is completed successfully, we can have the outcome or \"pen\" as an event. \n5. The question uses the word \"example\", which indicates that the answer can be considered a general concept that holds true for many actions or scenarios. \n6.

In addition, the option E being sleeping also implies the absence of activity which is not suitable for someone in their hunting activities.\n8.

The first choice given, A: More Fireflies, cannot be correct because a new moon would cause the opposite to happen. Additionally, since \u24fa is also the last option, the order of options cannot be helpful.\n2. The second choice, B: A Fog, is also incompatible because a fog would occur in addition to the bright weather.\n3.

Looking at the choices, we can conclude that feeling humiliated is irrelevant to this problem and thanking God or sleeping are not practical or plausible ways to get food. \n8. Choice D: hungry is not the right answer either because the question is about a solution to the problem, and this would just be a continuation of the person's suffering.\n9.

Where is the government increasing business taxes? Choices: 0.5: small business  0.2: large companies  0.8: individuals  0.3: banks  1: none\nRationales: The question asks about where business taxes will increase in the United States.\n1. First, analyze \"0.5\": 0.5 can be a percentage where the number before the percent sign is a fixed amount, like 0.5 dollars, where the number after the percent sign can change to indicate a percentage of this fixed amount, like in \"0.5\". So in this question, 0.5 represents a fixed amount and is equal to 0.5 percent.\n2. Then, analyze \"0.8\". 0.8 can also represent a fraction where the number before the slash is a fixed amount, 800, equal to 0.8, and the number after the slash is one-tenth of this fixed amount. In this question, 00.8 represents a fraction where the fixed amount is the same as the proportion of the number before the slash which is the tax rate and the number after it which is the amount the tax will increase by.\n3.

{"text": "as it fails to actively help the situation. So it does not fit the context.\n5. Choices B: hunt for, D: sleep, and E: prepare to go can all be seen to lead to finding food.\n6. Choice D: sleep does not directly lead to the procuremen of food. Sleeping results in a lack of productivity and a delay in finding food.\n7. Choice B: hunt for can be a means to finding food.\n8. However hunt for is only associated with hunting. The neolithic period began 11,000 years ago. Hunting as a main source of food is not feasible at this point in time as it's more likely that hunting provided a supplement to food.\n9. So we eliminate choice B: hunt for from the possibilities of actions required to obtain food. \n10. Choice E: prepare to go is similarly incompatible with neolithic society. People in the neolithic period tended to live together in villages and communities. \n11. Therefore, choice E: prepare to go does not make sense here.\n12. So the actions that we're left with in the question is B: hunt for and D: sleep.\n13. \"Hunting\" implies pursuing food, which is in line with the context as gathering food would not be a concern at this time.\n14. \"Sleep\" would also be a solution to this problem, but it does not directly lead to solving the problem as it is meant to heal mental and physical stress and not provide nourishment.\n15. This means that it may be an option, but it would be an indirect solution to the problem.\n16. However, a solution is needed that specifically leads to food, and this would be hunting.

However, one of the choices needs to be treated as all of their qualities are being denied them\nOut of the given choices, we can eliminate choices A and E because women in business are not being treated as what, but are being treated as professionals.\nWe can also eliminate choice B since being treated professionally and being treated as equals would result in both being treated equally if they are being treated professionally.\nFrom here, we go on to evaluate which of the remaining choices would be the most suitable choice out of all the others that can be applied to the given context to provide the most accurate answer. In this case, the phrase being treated equally and being treated as a professional is describing being treated equally and being professionally treated.\nTherefore, the answer would be one of the following:\nChoice C- To be professionally treated as equals.\nChoice D- To be professionally and equally treated as equals.\nIn conclusion, the answer is choice C\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: Who is likely to be an advocate for the reinstatement of the electric chair as a way of executing someone for the crime of murder?

Skateboarding 4. Hiking 5. Walking\nRationales: The question is asking about a less useful way of travelling. To determine the answers, we examine the attributes given in the problem: biking, boating, skateboarding, hiking and walking. \n1. Biking requires the use of a bicycle, which is useful for transportation.\n2. Boating requires a boat, which can be used for both transportation and recreation.\n3. Skateboard allows for both transportation and exercise.\n4. Hiking allows for both transportation around nature without vehicles while providing exercise.\n5. Walking only allows for transport, as it is an act of travelling on foot.\n6. Based on their descriptions, we can deduce that biking (1) and boating (2) offer the highest utility for travelling as they allow for both the means for travel and entertainment. \n7. We cannot determine which of the others provide the greatest utility without knowing the context of their use. For example, hiking may not be very useful if someone is travelling to a remote location while walking is best if someone is in a city.\n8. In this context, walking is the least useful way of travelling as it doesn't allow for activity during travel, and this option is not suitable for travelling in many situations.\nAnswer: D.

Since the question refers to the \"neolithic\" person, this era was characterized by the early development of agriculture, the primary method of acquiring food at the time. \n8. Therefore, the most likely solution to finding food for this person would be choice C (feeling humiliated). \n9.

The man goes to a what, which is a building where people go to do certain things.\n4. There are six what in the sentence, and four of them start with B: bar, baker, bank, and bedside, which are not what the old man needs as he is depressed.\n5.

Choices: A: young B: mature C: two D: three E: four\nRationales: The question describes that Diana's family was left by her father. The father here is assumed to be the man's father and the mother and children are the daughter's.\n1. When asked when Diana's father died, one can infer that this is an indication that he left the family earlier on, likely long before Diana came to being.\n2. A: young does not make sense, because young is a relative term referring to children and babies, so no one can be old when they are young.\n3. B: mature would be appropriate if the father was still present and the context of the question was asking the daughter's age when he was already dead. However, this is not the case here, so B can be ruled out.\n4. Choice C: two is correct as one could assume the father was divorced when Diana was two years old.\n5.

Choices:  A. entre sandwich B. sandwich entre C. sandwich inside D. sandwich outside\nRationales: Firstly, we need to look at the meaning of the verb 'to sandwich' to know if there is any relation to food.\nSecondly, the use of 'entre' is the main clue that this questions is about food as 'entre' translates to \"inside\" or \"between\" while \"sandwich\" translates to \"sandwich\".\nThirdly, 'outside\" and \"inside\" are mutually exclusive and cannot be applied to the same thing, so it is unlikely that both options B and D are applicable.\nThat leaves us only with options A and C\nLastly, there is an apostrophe mark at the end of the word 'entre' that makes the word be understood as a noun and not a verb.\nSo that means that option A and option C should be eliminated.\nThe question becomes whether 'a sandwich inside' and 'a sandwich outside' can represent the same food, which can be said to occur in options A and D but not B and C.\nOption D clearly states \"A sandwich out\" which means a sandwich outside and D does not have an apostrophe mark that makes it clear D is understood as a noun.\nSo the answer must be D.\nAnswer: D. sandwich outside.\n\n### Solution\nInput: Billy wants 12 cats as a pet.

This implies that the person may not have thought to pray or ask for divine intervention, as they would not have thought to do this for other, more attainable and practical needs and desires such as shelter and clothes. \n5. Since Choice A would not be a likely course of action, then we should look at what else the person could do to resolve the issue. \n6. Since they were hungry, they may consider choosing Option B: hunting for food or Option D: preparing to go.\n7. While Choice B: hunting for food may entail that the person leaves and comes back with food, it does not imply that the food was procured successfully, or that the person actually found food. \n8. Choice D: preparing to leave may have a similar connotation but on a practical level, it has less risk and no additional effort required.\n9. Therefore based on the available options, the most plausible choice to satisfy one's hunger is by simply leaving to seek food.\n10. Thus, the correct answer is E: \"prepare to go\".\nAnswer: E. Prepare to go\n\nInput: Danny is running very hard. He's getting very hungry, what is he likely to do? Choices:  B: sleep well  C: have a picnic  D: eat a lot E: eat a peanut \nRationales: The question asks if Danny is likely to do so and so based on a given predicate describing that he is running very hard and very hungry.\n1. The first step is knowing what to do based on the given predicate.\n2. When someone is running in a hard way, we can expect them to be exhausted but if they are getting hungry, we can expect that they will pause to eat; not to sleep well or to eat a lot. This is because they need a quick boost of energy which is not achieved by sleep or having a picnic but if it is a peanut; they won't even bother having a peanut.\n3. If they have food, they will eat it if they have a picnic. Otherwise, they will eat a lot. This happens because;\n4. People have a tendency to eat or drink a lot or eat what they are looking for the most or something that is most convenient.\n5. Therefore, the answer can", "answer": " 108"}

Choices:  a: people thought it was too good of an opportunity not to go to b: it was advertised highly c: people got together to work out ideas d: it required athletes to be in top shape e: people worked together to prepare for it\nRationales: Question: How did the greek Olympics become a huge success? The most reasonable answer is not choice (A) as they thought it was too good an opportunity to miss out on, since that would not be the primary reason for its popularity, but choice (D) as it is required for athletes to prepare for it. \nQuestion: What does it require for athletes to participate in the Greece Olympic Games? The answer required for the question is the preparation for the competition described in choice (D) given for the previous question. \nAnswer:D->E, and since not even choice (E) is adequate as such people work together to prepare for the olympic games, the best choice that can be made is choice (C) as choosing the most reasonable answer for the previous question and giving the correct answer to the current question requires the most reasonable action.

Choices:  Answers: * None (This is incorrect choice). * 2nd finger **Middle **3rd finger *** index finger \nRationales: It's very clear that we are not talking about one of the fingers. It's most probably a bone name in between the ring finger and the middle finger. The word'middle' in between is obvious.\nThe other choices, except None, are all the bones between Ring and Middle finger. They all are fingers in between but there is only one that has anatomical name middle finger and it's the second finger.

Choices:  a: kitchens from other establishments B: buffet caterers C: buffet restaurants D: kitchen trucks E: buffet suppliers\nRationales: Let's take a closer look at the words used in the question. \n1. It does not say anywhere that the food comes from the establishment's kitchen.  Instead, it says \"the food on a buffet\". This implies that the food isn't prepared by the establishment themselves, but rather obtained from somewhere else. \n2. Furthermore, the words \"a buffet table\" means that there is no kitchen on-site, but in other words that there is no catering service available there. If the establishment had its own kitchen, there would probably be food on a buffet from that location rather than a buffet table.\n3. Choice B suggests that these establishments buy food from buffet caterers.  However, the question asked, \"Where does the food on a (buffet) table come from?\"  Food from a buffet table is already there, it's not purchased after you have already arrived.\n4. Choice C seems to be a possibility since buffet caterers cater food to numerous different establishments. However, in this case, the establishments have food on the buffet.\n5.

Choice D: \"Sleep\" is a possible solution but it would only lead to satisfying hunger temporarily, as falling asleep does not allow us to find food or procure nourishment.\n8. Choice E is the most logical option that can be matched to the prompt.

Since feeling humiliated usually means not doing anything about the emotion, this choice is also ineligible.\n7. We can then determine that Choice D: sleep must be the answer, since sleeping would probably cause the hunger to go away when waking up afterward. \n8. As for Choice E: prepare to go, it might appear that it could be a solution to solving the hunger problem since leaving somewhere else might result in getting food to eat.

Choices: A: big B: small C: huge D: tiny E: minuscule\nRationales: One of the attributes of a computer is that it is the size of a large elephant. In order to determine the best quality of an elephant, we need to identify what the correct answer is regarding this question. The word'size' in this sentence represents the physical size of an elephant as opposed to the qualities of the elephant. The qualities of an elephant are instead represented by the attributes of the computer. To determine which option is most fitting to the computer's description, we need to consider what the qualities of an elefant are. If the computer's size suggests that it is a large elephant, we can deduce that this is referring to a large size. This is why option C is the best option to fill in'size'. \nAnswer: C: huge.

Choice C: feel humiliation is a logical response to hunger, but it is not an action that will help satiate their hunger pains.\n8. Therefore, the action that solves the problem is Choice B; in this case, we could identify hungry as the primary attribute of the person, while the action is hunting for food. \n9. In summary, since the neolithic is hungry, the action that would yield the solution of satiating their hunger is, Hunting for food.\n10.

We can eliminate option A. If we travel from the Sun, we would return after completing one orbit, taking 8 light minutes. So, we can eliminate options B and D. The answer is C.\nAnswer: C. 10 billion years.\n\nInput: I have a little red, What is it?

That is school of beauty. \n4. That is the answer of the second question. Now we find out why she looked like a new look. Why does she had a new look? Because she went to school of beauty! \n5. Layton had a nail surgery and she also had some new look on her make up! We know that because she's going to school of beauty!

{"text": "to a problem about food, as the individual is already hungry and has an urgent need for nourishment. \n5. This leaves us with the remaining choices: hunt for food, feel humiliated, sleep, or prepare to go. \n6. Feeling hungry and humiliated is a negative experience that can potentially lead to feeling sleepy. However, as the need for food is critical in this scenario, sleep is not an appropriate reaction and sleepiness is not a solution to the problem. \n7. This leaves \"hunt for food\" and \"prepare to go\". \n8. Hunting for food is the most applicable action given the context, and it would likely lead to acquiring nourishment.\n9. Therefore option B: hunt for some food is the most suitable action. So, the answer is B: hunt for something to eat.\nAnswer: B: hunt for *something* to eat\n\nInput: The sun is always shining, what is it like day after day? Choices:  sunny A: dark B: cloudy C: rainy D: sunny\nRationales:1. The sun is always shinning implies that the sun is not affected by any weather conditions and it always appears bright and cheerful.\n2. Weather is the state of the atmosphere and conditions that cause the sky to be what it is.\n3. To find the answer, we need to compare the descriptions of the day after day to the conditions in the previous part of the question.\n4. The sun is always bright and cheerful. We can deduce that the sky must be either sunny or always cloudy. \n5. Sunny refers to a day when the sky is bright and clear without any clouds.\n6. Cloudy could refer to a day when the sunlight appears dim because of the large number of clouds in the sky. \n7. Therefore, the answer has to be either day after day sunny weather or cloudy weather. \n8. Among the choices, a sunny day after day is not a plausible scenario given the previous description of the sun always being bright and cheerful. \n9. \"Rainy\" does not fit the description because the sun could still be bright even when it is raining. \n10. This leaves us with two options: cloudy and sunny. \n1", "answer": " 25"}

Lastly, choice E: prepare to leave indicates that there is some form of food around, which is implied by the question, as it refers to hunger. \n8.

Therefore, the answer to the given problem would be A: (hunt for food)\nAnswer: A: hunt for food\n\nInput: Which one of these food would be popular at a summer picnic? Choices:  I. A barbeque sandwich laden with cheese  II. An overfired hotdog with ketchup too  III. An all-American burger covered in onion rings  IV. A sweet fruit salad VI. Cool watermelon  V. Hot corn on the cob  VI. A slushy drink  VII. Juicy strawberry shortcake\nRationales: The author used the question to refer to the types of  food that  would be popular at summertime picnics. \n\n1. There is no wrong answer\n2. Examine each of the options carefully. \n3. Option `I` describes a sandwich covered in cheese that might be eaten during Summer picnics.  However, it is not the best option because the sandwich does not have summer food essence like watermelon, corn cob,  fruit salads, watermelon, shortcakes, etc. \n4. Option II described a overfired hotdog that covered in a very little amount of ketchup.  It is not better choice than the sandwich covered with lots of cheese.  Therefore, food number I should be the one to be eliminated.\n5. Option III is a burger covered with onion rings. It might be quite the summer dish with the fried onion and juicy meat with melted cheese. \n6.

Thus, the answer to this question is D: sleep. The person in this scenario would be tired and sleepy as they had not eaten anything for some time leading to this condition.

{"text": "- food is unlikely to appear if the person were to just thank god. Choices B and C are also unlikely to yield food, as you cannot hunt for food by just saying so, nor will it magically appear if you feel humiliated or are in a sleeping state.\n5. Only choice D: prepare to go presents anything that is likely to result in food. This option is the only plausible solution to food shortage as it implies that the person had to work for and find something to eat. \n6.

The sentence could be saying that Marketers and Sales Staff are interested in the product launch or the sentence could be saying someone very interested will be in the category of Marketers and Sales Staff. \nThe sentence as written does not imply anything about the Marketer and Sales Staff. They are not specifically stated to be very interested in the product launch. \nTherefor, it is not possible to determine from this information who is very interested in the product.  \nThis could be a subject or an object. So we do not know if someone interested in the product will be a Marketer or Sales Staff. \nWe are not even sure if Marketers are interested in the launch. They could be or could be not.

This demonstrates what? Choices: A: perfectionism B: dedication C: stubbornness D: progress E: motivation\nRationales:1. This context tells us a bit about Miley. She was a terrible violin player through high school, but she made progress in college.\n2. \u201cPerfectionism\u201d is the term used to describe an obsession with the need to be perfect. 3. \u201cProgress\u201d is the name given to the process of getting better. 4. This means the passage describes how Miley got better as a violin player.\n5. There are a number of other possibilities that could apply in this context. Perfectionism, dedication, stubbornness, and motivation could all relate to how Miley improved. 6. Perfectionism and motivation both describe an obsession with improving, so while they both fit the case, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a clear choice.\n7. Since only the student can make progress at college, and dedication and stubbornness are character traits rather than actions, progress is the only choice that fits.\nAnswer: EProgress.\n\nInput: You can use a drill to remove a broken pencil lead, but  You can't do it with a hammer.

Choice C: hunt for nuts, berries, and other wild edibles while the neolithic persons were hunter-gatherers themselves, that would've been their standard method of obtaining food.\n8. Choice E: prepare to go indicates that the neoliths left their home and went out in search of food, which also makes sense given their lifestyle. \n9.

Choice E: prepare to go does not mention how the person will find or procure food. Further, it is not a reliable solution to starvation since they wouldn't be able to find food immediately. Therefore, this choice doesn't satisfy the criteria.\n8. As such, this leaves us with Choice C where the person is said to feel humiliated. They feel a need to overcome this, which leads to them seeking out food. Choice C: feel humiliate is the solution the person could have chosen.\n9.

Finally, choosing C: feels humiliated refers to the possibility of the person feeling embarrassed by their situation, which is also not a direct means of obtaining food.\n8. Therefore, the most reasonable choice is B: to hunt for food as this would mean actively seeking out food rather than just resting passively or asking God.\n9.

Based on the context of the performance, it can be inferred that it is likely some sort of show or act.\n2. An \"angry adrenaline rushing rush\" is not fitting for a \"performance,\" which requires specific emotions such as excitement and joy.\n3.

A: having a short tail B: using its left front claw C: standing on its hind legs D: having four feet E: having a long tail\nRationales: The question is requesting a definition of the term \"biped\".\n1. It is crucial to understand the difference between a quadruped and a biped, as the question asks for a definition of the biped classification.\n2. Choices A and D both pertain to a quadruped, or a creature having four legs. Choices E, B, C, and F are about anatomy and biology, and thus not relevant to determining the definition of a biped.\n3. Since \"biped\" is a term used in biology and refers to the specific characteristics that qualify an organism as belonging to this classification, the answer must be about the biological and anatomical traits of a biped which leads us to C: using its left front leg.\n4. Therefore, the answer to the question is C: using its left-front claw.\nAnswer: C Using its Left Front Claw\n\nInput: We think our cat is a vegetarian, but she's actually a What?

Choices: A: cut down B: grow C: make more D: pick E: use F: water\nRationales: The following is an explanation of how to answer the question:\n1. The farmer is going harvest his crops, therefore, the issue is how to do it.\n2. He needs to have the right to do what to harvest his cropland.\n3. When deciding an option for the answer, it is important to understand the term 'the right to'.\n4. It does not mean 'permission' because that is another term the question uses in another context.\n5. Therefore, it will be helpful to define the word 'right' and use it in the context of the question.\n6. According to the Cambridge dictionary, the definition of the word right in this case is 'to have permission.'\n7. Based on this definition, the farmer's right to do something is nothing short of permission to do it.\n8. Now it is important to understand whether his permission would enable the act itself or merely make the doing of the act possible.\n9. It is possible that the farmers' right to harvest may allow him to do so.\n10. It's possible though unlikely that he was already allowed to do it before.\n11. Finally, the right to harvest implies he is not prohibited from doing so.\n12. Therefore, the choice that would best fit the question would be F: to use the cropland.\n13.

The options given are all places that one could shop for a phone.\n1. Let us analyze the different options given in the context of the question \n2. Choice A: a shopping mall - In a shopping mall, we do not buy phones specifically. There is no point in purchasing a phone in that location where we are also buying everyday necessities (like food)\n3. Choice B: online - She bought the first phone in a store. When she bought the second phone, did she travel to another country to buy it?\n4. Choice C: a phone dealer - There are some stores which buy and sell cell phones.

Choice D: sleeping would seem to require a certain amount of nourishment for survival and may leave the hypothetical person vulnerable to starvation.\n6. Choices B and E: hunt for food and prepare to go respectively, are two options related to finding food, but they may be too passive compared to the situation depicted in the question. \n7. Choice E: prepare to go indicates that the person will start looking for food rather than immediately acting to find it, it is thus a possibility, albeit unlikely. \n8. This leaves choice C: feel humiliation. \n9. Humiliation can mean a lack of confidence and could lead to the person becoming passive to their situation.\n10. This could suggest that they would feel ashamed about asking for food and not seek to obtain it.\n11. It is theoretically possible that the person could starve due to feeling too low to seek food. \n12. However, the implied tone of the question is sarcastic and suggests that there is no such thing as a neolithic person with \"huner pain\" for whom the solution to hunger is merely to pray to \"bread gods\". \n13. Therefore, since the question is not meant to be interpreted as a serious explanation of a scenario in history, choice C: feel humilliation is the answer. \n14.

However, the timeframe provided could not be interpreted as being at least three days later. \n6. This is due to the lack of time and resources present during the time of neolithic hunters and gatherers. \n7. Therefore, we can rule out choice B, which means that the other choices are likely to be true solutions to the problem of hunger.\n8. In this case, choices C, D and E all have some sort of action that may provide nourishment.\n9. In addition, choices C, D, and E all indicate that some form of preparation was made in planning to deal with hunger. This is consistent with the timeframe present in the problem. \n10. Choice D: prepare to go indicates that the person left the immediate area for a longer period of time while seeking food. Although this is plausible, based on the timeframe, we can't completely rule out the possibility that the preparation described in choice E was meant to stay longer. \n11. Therefore, in this case, our choices are reduced to either choice C or D. \n12. Now, let' see which action better describes the option that would lead to the neolithic hunter and gatherer solving their hunger problem: The question describes a situation where a neolithic person is hungry and wants to feed themselves.\n13. Therefore, choice D: prepare to go is not the best option to solve the hunger problem as someone is unlikely to prepare to leave an area for longer without eating first.\n14.

Choices: A: difficult B: tiresome C: strenuous D: long E: exhausting\nRationales: The question says we can describe an experience that is tiresome and long as what. To find this out we must find a noun which can be used to describe these two experiences. \nSo we must find a nounce which is both tiresome and long.\n1. An easy example would be a 12 hours flight, which is tiresome since it's long, or a one hour drive, which is tiresome because it's long and strenuous because you have to drive for an hour to get where you want. \n2. So we need to find a noun that's also long and tiresome, since arduous is an adjective.\n3. We need a noun to describe both experiences as adjective would modify the experience.\n4. A: difficult is both tiresome as long. \n5. B: tiresome does not have tiresome to it. \n6. C: strenuous is a noun which means doing physical labor and is mostly used to describe physical activities. \n7. Here we find that strenuous is not used to describe an experience. \n8. D: long is used to describe an experience, like long drive to a destination, but it is not tiresome.  E: The only remaining option that means tiresome, long, like a long flight is exhausting. \n9.

As part of the investigation, how should they  proceed? Choices:  a: stop b: stop and get help c: continue d: think about the problem for a week or two E: focus on the problem\nRationales: For the answer choice, it is important to break down the question, which starts with : A scientist needs to investigate the cause of the flu. The scientist needs this investigation as part of their investigation process. As a result they will focus on something which helps them. They will continue until they find what will work or until it stops.\nA: stop b: stop and get help c: continue\nSo this is important because stop can mean several things and one may be they will stop the investigation for more information. To continue they will need more information/research. Stop and get help will depend on what stops. Continue can mean more than one thing as well. So we will consider this next:\nStop, and get help: Can mean getting different opinions. Can indicate something else?\nContinue to investigate: Can mean several thing, we will focus on the process. They will continue to find what causes it, until what is causing it does not. To do that they may use other tools and methods. Also if it does not work.

A person may also want to get more training but it is not in the scope of the question; therefore we can eliminate this choice.\n3. So the other choices remain A: education, B: qualifications, C: certificates, and D: abilities.\n4. Of these, to get a better job we need more education or qualifications to be considered eligible for a better job.\n5. So the answer is B: qualifications.\n6. Qualifications refer to your skills, strengths, and talents as that makes you eligible for a particular job.\n7.

Choices:  C: calm A: happy D: patient B: peaceful\nRationales:  1. The given definition of Candy is \"Mild-tempered\" and one should find a supporting clue in the question to identify the correct answer.\n2. There are several relevant qualities of a person that can depict a gentle nature, but the question is asking about how.\n3. If we look back at the definition, we can consider three of the four provided descriptions to be supporting clues.\n4. Choice D: \"Patient\" may seem to represent Candy being mild-tempered. However, this is not the most relevant or descriptive answer. \n5. If we consider the question again, we can notice that Candy needs to be patient to exhibit that she is mild-tempered despite adversary.\n6. This is because she is likely to be met with harsh situations or problems throughout the course of the story.\n7. A patient person therefore would be an appropriate choice to explain a mild-tempered individual because it describes a person who is able to deal with these situations and not lose their temper.\n8.

Choices:  a: baking b: grinding c: raising d: proofing e: cooling\nRationales: Question: The bakery ordered bread. How do flour and Yeast come together?\n1. First, let us identify the phrasing used in the question. The question refers to \"how do flour and yeasts come together\"?\n2. When determining what \"together\" refers to here, it would be reasonable to think that the phrase \"together\" refers the same as \"coming together\" in terms of joining or combining together. \n3.. Therefore, it is necessary to find a way that flour and yeasts combine to create bread.\n4. Now, let' look through the choices provided and see if any of them match the definition of \"together\" in the question. \n5. Let's take a look at Choices A-D. The choices refer to specific aspects of producing the bread. For instance, Choice B refers to Baking, which would be the post-production of the bread after it's already combined.\n6. Choice B is thus discarded. \n7. Therefore, Choice E is the most likely answer since it refers to the coming together of raw flour and yeasts during the dough-making process.\n8. Therefore, the answer can be found in Choice E: \"Coming together\" is a good fit here since you combine the ingredients to make dough. This is also a reason that D can also fit: they mix the flour and the yeast to make the bread dough", "answer": " 60"}

Choices:  B: Walgreen's C: Walmart E: Office Depot  A: Staples D: Penny's\nRationales: First, Let's identify what is missing in the question: There is an incomplete sentence with a blank. The sentence starts after \"Where are we\". The next sentence is \"finding the best quality Pencils?\"\n2. The answer to this question is E: Office Depot.\nThe answer is an adjective \"best quality\" and the sentence starts with \"Where are we\".\nIt is not stated in the question, so any answer with adverbs like \"best quality\" or \"good quality\" is incorrect.\nExample: \"Where are we finding the best pens?\" would be incorrect.\n3. This means that the only answer is an adjective, and since the answer is \"best\", the blank should be filled in by an adjective that is used to describe the location.\n4. A place that is associated with quality is \"Office Depot\". Therefore, \"Office Depot\" is the correct answer.\n5. Another reason to choose \"Office Depot\" as the answer is that the other choices \"Walgreem's\", \"Walmart\", \"Penny's\", \"Staples\" do not describe a location. So they cannot be an adjective to fill the blank.\n\n#", "answer": " 6"}

This may result in an attempt to procure food. However, since we do not know which location they are in, it is not immediately clear what method of procurement would result.\n8. Among the remaining options, choice B expresses the most apt and beneficial action- \"hunting for food\".\n9. According to the question, the neolithic people were hungry and seeking food, so they should ideally perform an action that would lead them to hunting for food.\n10.

It is clearly hungry because it makes all kinds of howling noises.  What type of snake was seen here? Choices:  C: venomous D: nonvenomous E: bite-less\nRationales:\n1. The question is about identifying the type of snake seen in the movie.\n2. From the narration provided, we can deduce that the snake is hungry, making it possible to identify the animal.\n3. From the choices given, D (nonvenomous) is immediately eliminated as the animal.\n4. Choice B (stinging) refers to a snake's fangs which inject venom, not its snarling or hiss. It is not an accurate description of the noise the snake made in the movie.\n5. Choices A and E are also wrong based on the described behavior of the snakes.\n6. What remains is Choice C (venomous) which can be inferred from the statement that the snakes hisses and makes noises.\n7. The correct answer should be C", "answer": " 4"}

Therefore we must consider what action the person has to take to fix their hunger problem.  \n8. Based on reason 3 above, the person must go out and hunt for some type of food for themselves, which would help solve their hunger problem. \n9.

Choices: 12 A: 15 B: 12 C: 10 D: 20 E: 35\nRationales: The question indicates what the seventh term of an arithmetic sequence would be.\n4. From the given options, it is immediately apparent that choices E: 35 and B: 12 are far too large since the sequence starts at one, so the seventh term should be at most four units larger than one. \n5. However, this implies that the sequence ends after the seventh term has been counted, so the answer cannot be one. \n6. To determine the answer, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is An = a + (n \u2013 1)d.\n7. With the given information, a = 1, d = 3, and n = 7, we can then solve for An, which is An = 1 + 7 - 1 = 1+6=7, and since that is the smallest value for an, our answer is choice A: 12.\nAnswer: B: 12", "answer": " 6"}

Hence, in addition to not feeling hungry, the person would also most likely have the benefit of being well-fed.\n9. Consequently, the best choice of action would be D: prepare to go.\nAnswer: D : prepare to go.\n\nInput: If you are looking for a good deal on a used bike,  where is a good place to start? Choices: 1. A: a garage 2. B: a showroom 3. C: a pawnshop 4. D: a market\nRationales: First, look for the best deal with how much money they're offering for the bike.\n1. Since \"bike\" is generic, consider the other options (A: a garage) a \"bike shop\" (B and C: a showroom, a pawnshop).\n2. Pawnshop generally offers to buy/sell used items at lower prices than garages/showrooms 3. A bike sold at a pawnshop would not be in the best condition (see item 5)\n4. \"A garage\" seems to refer to a dealership, so if the person is looking for a used bike, they would likely prefer not to buy from a \"showroom\" (B: a showroom).\n5. A garage may have a pawn shop but would not sell items for very cheap.

Choice B: hunt for foood is the closest that could be matched with the neolithic period. During this period, hunting and farming were the primary sources of food; thus, this choice would be the most suitable answer.\nAnswer: B: hunt for Food\n\nInput: If I were a sharpening stone, I would sharpen a what? Choices: A: knife B: carvings C: tool D: chisel E: axe\nRationales: The question is asking about what a stone could sharpen if it were a sharpened stone. To answer it, we need to use a metaphor of the question to understand what the stone could realistically be used to sharpen. A stone can only be used to sharpe a dull object, such as a knife, a carving, or a tool. A stone cannot be used to sharpec an axe, and thus it would be reasonable to assume that a sharpeningstone can sharpen whatever object it comes into contact with. Now, consider the choices given. A sharpening stone cannot be used tosharpen an axe so E and D are ruled out. A sharpened stone comes into contact with whatever object is dull to sharpen it. Therefore, whatever object a stone comes into contact with will be sharpened and therefore D and E are removed. Out of the remaining choices,B is the most logical. The question is using the word tool instead of cutting knife, which would mean that it is asking what kind of tool a sharpening tool could sharpen. The answer is B.\nAnswer: B : knife\n\nInput: You have a 2D shape.  If it's not a cube you can always stretch it horizontally, which means it has something very special about it: it's what?

He's not always nice with his friend.\n5. These all come together to define him as an abberant individual.\n6. To give a description of his character, we use the options given.\n7. Bully best describes jack. \n8. We know that Jack is bully, so we don't need option D, braggart.\n9.

Choices: A: pizza B: food delivery C: homework D: schoolwork E: exercise\nRationales: One: The pizza delivery person is a hero (superlative): \"to call a person's heroic actions and achievements a hero is a sign of respect and admiration\" (Dictionary). It makes sense to mention someone is super in heroic actions to describe the extraordinary feats they achieve.\nThe question: \"They've been able to (has + infinitive) help more people get what?\" is what type of question: Choices: A: direct B: indirect C: active & passive D: yes-no It is a indirect question because of the use of the pronoun \"they've\", which does not necessarily correspond to a direct statement. To answer the question, we need to focus on the action in the statement, \"has been able to help\". It implies the answer is \"helped\" because \"having been able to do something\" does usually mean \"having done it\".  However, the answer is provided in the form of \"more people getting what\"? Because in the second phrase, the subject \"what\" is the most important; \"got\", \"get\" or \"pizza\" are secondary.  It is D.

Shoes, boots, socks and gloves, are not all kinds of footwear. Winter wear and boots are both kinds of footwear, but only winter wear is not a kind of shoe, and only boots are a kind of shoe. \n3. Choice A: shoes is incorrect as a choice because a pair of shoes does not always include boots.

He was a terrible what? Choices: A: dad B: father C: sibling D: parent E: friend\nRationales: This question is about assessing a man's actions with regards to fathering his children, we are evaluating his behavior as a father.\n1. Firstly, we assess the answer choices by asking ourselves if they make sense.\n2. In this case, choice C (sibling) makes no sense, since he was not his sibling and so cannot be an adequate replacement for a father.\n3. In addition, \"terrible\" implies that his behavior was not at an acceptable level, so choice D (parent) seems irrelevant as they are already a parent (to his children) and so his behavior was not at a terrible level.\n4. From this reasoning, choices A (dad), B (father) and E (friend) seem likely to be a more suitable answer for this question.\n5. However \"terrible\" implies an undesirable level of behavior, not a neutral one.\n6. Choices A and B refer to \"father figures\", an alternate term for someone who takes on a parental role for other people's children - which the man was not. \n7. Thus, Choice E: friend would make most sense, as the other answer choices are used to identify a type or quality of parent; Choice E is used to identify the person providing the role, be it a father, parent or friend (option D).\n8. In summary, it is the last answer choice that best captures the essence of the question and as such would be the correct one, so answer D: friend.\nAnswer: D.Friend\n\nInput: My daughter is very talented.

The final two options seem to be closely matched, but a closer examination reveals that choice D: go sleep would not necessarily contribute to procuring any food.\n7. This leaves the other two option which suggest that the hungry person in neolithic times would most likely choose choice B: hunt food or choice C: feel humilated, as these actions align with both their need and instinct to survive.\n8.

Choices:  [A]: talk [B]: communicate [C]: think [D]: speak [E]: listen\nRationales:1. The question gives two pieces of information about someone: they are articulate and they should do something.\n2. A person who is articulate \"shows a smooth flow of language\" and is \"clear in expression\". \n3. The question asks about something that should be done, which can be interpreted as a requirement or action step. \n4. Since \"talk\" and \"speak\" are verbs, they represent actions and are, therefore, acceptable. (This can be compared to the verbs \"think\" and \"listen\" which are not actions.) \n5. However, talking could be interpreted to mean in general, which would not necessarily be articulately, so we exclude this choice. \n6. While both speaking and talking can be done articulately, it is unclear which the question refers to, so we are required to identify an option that better conveys the intended meaning. \n7. We could rule out \"think\", \"listen\" and \"communicate\": \n-Thinking can be articulately expressed.\n-Listening can be articulately received.\n-Communicating can be done articulatively and requires both speaking and thinking.

These grade social events have specific names, such as concert, play, performance hall, choral hall, and auditorium.\n3. However, they are not mentioned in any order.\n4. As such, any of them could potentially be the event she is supposed to host.\n5. She is very fond of drama, which would make hosting a play or a performance the most fitting choice, since it is directly relevant to what she's passionate about.\n6. It should be noted that although there are other choices, such as concert and the choral hall, these options can either relate to music, so they wouldn't make sense, as her 8th grade academic record is not known.

The same could be the case for Choice C: feel humiliate as this is a type of action that might cause humiliation.\n8. Therefore, we can say that a more probable choice than A or B is D: (prepares to go).\n9.

{"text": "to the problem as it does not directly lead to getting food and may be considered a form of wishful thinking.\n5. Choice D: sleeping is not very likely given that the problem is stated as \"being\" hungry, rather than \"becoming\" hungry. This suggests that the person is already experiencing hunger and needs to find food right away.\n6. The other choices, A - E, could potentially be considered practical solutions to the problem, but choice B is unlikely to be a solution to the problem as the person needs to look for food to address \"hunger\", rather than \"go hunting\".\n7. Based on the reasons above, the only choice that makes sense to us is choice C that says \"Feel humiliated\".\n8. In the neolithic era, humiliation was associated with finding food. If someone finds food, they are likely to feel humbled because they have solved the problem of not having it.\n9. For this reason, feel humiliated is a realistic solution to the problem of being hungry presented in the question and the answer.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: A bird lives with a frog. When does the bird need to eat what? Choices: A: stinky food B: stinksy frog C: stinky fruit D: stinky feathers E: stinky worms\nRationales:\n1. We consider why a bird might live with a frog? It implies that the bird might seek shelter in an unstable natural environment, as frogs are used to wet tropical climates.\n2. A bird must eat in order to maintain its energy.\n3.

The question asks for two main groups of microbes and gives an option: \u201cnone of the above\u201d.\n2. Looking into the key phrases \u201cthe two\u201d and \u201cmain\u201d, we can figure there are two groups but one will be the main one.\n3. Now we\u2019ll be examining the options to determine the ones that qualify.\n4. Option A stands out since there are three main types of fungi which are yeasts, molds, and mushrooms so \u201cthe two main groups of fungi\u201d implies that yeasts will be the main group.\n5. Hence, the correct answer is A - fungi.\n6. If the answer was option B - bacteria or option C - viruses, both fungi/molds and bacteria/viruses would be included in \u201cthe two main groups\u201d\n7. Since answer A would exclude bacteria/virus the answer is A - fungus.\n8.

The question asks how you feel after being on leave from work, we can understand from the context that you are probably referring to a period of time at work that you would typically describe as busy and hectic. \n2. On leave means being away from work, and on this leave you feel the opposite emotions.\n3. We need to determine which of these emotions is most likely to be felt after being on leave. \n4. There is some overlap between the question and the choices given. For example, the emotions of D and E are both negative and are related to the notion of the word \"away\". \n5. Further, the emotions of A and E are positive. However, A is specifically expressed in terms of the context of being on leave. So the only options that can be discarded are B and D.\n6.

Choice C: feeling humiliated would not be a helpful solution because it would make the person lose self-confidence, not food.\n6. Choices B and D: hunting for food, preparing to go are both ways to find or obtain food. Out of these choices, D is better because to prepare to go, the person would have to search for something, or at least plan where to search, and option D is the best solution to a problem of being hungry.\n7.

Choices: A: being benevolent B: helping everyone C: being kind D: being cruel E: being good\nRationales: The question presents three attributes of the king of England: benevolent, kind, good.\nBenevolent means generous or kind. \nKind implies being pleasant or helpful.\nGood means being morally right or pleasing.\nThe question asks what the king will be remembered for.\nAmong the answer choices, helping everyone is most likely because being king of England entails the capacity to affect others and help them. \nBeing excellent and benevolent suggests excellent performance in something.\nBeing cruel is not likely because being cruel is not morally right or pleasurable.\n\nThis means that the other answer choices will describe qualities that go along with benevolence and excellence.\n\nBeing good is another adjective that describes benevolence and excellency, but this is a subjective perception. For example, someone may disagree with the King of England's idea of good.\n\nTherefore, the choice for being good is incorrect, but the answer to the question is benevolent, which describes the attribute of helping everyone. \nAnswer: Helping everyone\n\n### Test #5\n\nInput: The two main methods of planting seeds are sowing and what?

{"text": "to the problem of hunger. This option also refers to a specific individual, whereas the solution should be more general and applicable to people in general.\n5. Choice D: sleep refers to the person \"going to sleep\" rather than preparing or doing something to satisfy their hunger. 6. Choice B: hunt for nourishment is somewhat vague because it doesn't specify the type of nourishment or how it would be acquired. Although animals are a form of nourishment to humans, the context of this question does not indicate any animals being present or their role in the hunger mitigation.\n7. Choice E: prepare to go indicates that the solution is for the person to leave his habitat in search of food outside. However, this does not seem likely as the person is mentioned to be \"neolithic\".\n8. The question is about the neolithic period which refers to early homo sapiens that were transitioning from hunting and gathering to agriculture and livestock domestication.\n9. As such, it is reasonable to assume that this person would not have moved out of their habitat to seek food, but rather they would have used resources in their close environment to procure food within their habitat.\n10. Therefore, it is the action of \"preparing\" or \"doing something to satisfy their hungert that is the more accurate action to solve the problem of being hungry.

{"text": "to the problem since it would not do anything to solve the person's hunger.\n5. Choice C: feeling humiliated also does not suggest any potential food acquisition, however, it does involve some sort of personal difficulty or stress. The neolithic people may have felt humiliated at not having food.\n6. Of the remaining choices: hunting for food (choice B), preparing to go (choice E), or sleeping (choice D), we consider which option is a realistic solution to the hunger problem.\n7. Both hunting for food and sleeping are active actions related to attempting to find food. However, sleeping is not very likely to solve the problem of hunger since it would not be a quick process and sleep may not end immediately, meaning the person would wake up later without having gotten any food.\n8. Hunting for food can be an effective solution to the problem as it suggests actively searching for food, but the specific act of hunting can be dangerous since there might be animals that could attack or food that is inaccessible or not edible.\n9. Because of the uncertainty involved in hunting and the possible danger, this means it may take a long time or even not work.\n10. Therefore we must go with option B as the most viable solution for hunting for food. Since the person is hungry, the need for an immediate response is necessary, therefore, time will not matter. This also means that the action will result in the acquisition of food and not a result less tangible, such as the person feeling humiliated.\n11. Finally, the question is asking for what the neolithic people do to find food while being hungry. \n12. Therefore, the answer to the question is B: Hunting, as this is the only action that can actively do something to remedy the hunger problem.

Finally, choice E fits best because \"preparing to go\" is to leave a place to go somewhere else in search of food. Since the neolithic was hungry, they would have to go somewhere else to eat and option E is the action that fits that description.\n8.

Options may be determined from the question, or they can be implied from the question.\n2. For instance, the question mentions \"beneficial to the woman\".\n3. This means the options should relate to improving the woman's condition.\n4. The actions we consider are A: live longer, B: feel better, C: feel happier, D: feel less tired, E: relax more. \n5. Options B and D describe actions that would have a positive impact on the woman's mood, but they wouldn't necessarily benefit her.\n6. B: Feel better \"feeling better\" can have a positive impact on a women's mood. \n7. But does feeling happy increase the length of a person's life? No. \n8.

There is still a need for the person to prepare their meal, which is what we have in option E.\n8. Prepare to go is something that the hungry person can do before deciding whether or not to actually go hunting.\n9. This option would allow the person to have a backup plan when searching for food.

One has already been working at home, so there is no \"new culture\" to learn. In addition, there isn't any mention of learning in the question.\nOption B:  Work hard is not a good thing to do because when there are difficulties at work, people must be flexible and resourceful to find a solution. So if you work hard, you cannot solve problems, because if you work hard, it will be difficult to maintain a balance and be more flexible.\nOption C: Work efficiently can be a good thing to do, but according to the question, it does not match the keyword \"abroad\" - \"Efficiency\" means doing something fast and well, but working on the \"other side of the planet\" means that efficiency would be meaningless, since it won't make a difference.

People often use \"my or \"I\" in their first sentence because many people feel that doing so is proper English usage. However, this practice is unnecessary and repetitive, so we should use it less often \n2. Although the first sentence may feel grammatically correct, this does not necessarily mean that \"my\" or \"my is\" are used with any meaning. It might simply be a matter of preference, or they could be used to avoid being ambiguous or unclear when referring to yourself\n3. When examining whether to use \"I\" or \"me\" in a given sentence, context is key. We should bear in mind that using the appropriate word can convey a meaning that is otherwise impossible to communicate, such as possession, clarifying a verb, or a specific point in time or place.\n4. We should also consider whether the meaning conveyed by \"I\" or \"my\" is necessary given the intended audience and purpose of the speech. If the use of \"I\" or \"My\" is not essential to conveying the meaning of the sentence or communicating a specific point, then a third person pronoun should be used as an alternative.\n5. When making decisions regarding the appropriate usage of pronouns, keep in mind the desired impact on the audience. If we use \"my\" or 'I\" too often, the audience may be confused or feel bored by the repetition, in which case we would prefer to use a third person pronoun instead.\n6.

Choice E sounds like a command to go somewhere: a suggestion or instruction on how to solve the problem: that you should go somewhere to find food.\n10. Choice E, therefore, seems to have a better rationale for the solution. \n11. In conclusion, among the given choices of neolithic person's problem, we should choose option E (prepare to go) because it will most likely lead to a successful resolution of the problem.\nAnswer: E- prepare to go\n\n##### Explanation:", "answer": " 16"}

Choice E: preparing to go might be an action taken before the finding of food, but since it is stated that they are hungry, the immediate problem is finding food, not having the means to venture outside in search of it. Above all, the hungry person wants a food they can eat immediately and not something they need to prepare to consume.\n7.

What type of musician is performing with a symphony orcestra. This question suggests that we look at musicians and the type that are likely to be performing in this environment.\n\n3. What instruments do the musicians play? Do they perform music live, for example, playing piano?\n\n4. From the above question, we can eliminate the possibility of the choice of composer and conductor.  \n\n5. A composer is a musician who creates or writes music. This kind of musician is unlikely to perform with a symphonic orchestra as their job is to write the music.  \n\n6. A conductor directs an orchestra's musical performance and also adjusts the balance within the group's various sections. This is done by conducting- a gesture language. \n\n7.

This could be a solution to the problem the person faces, but it is vague as to how it actually solves the issue of being hungry.\n6. Choice D: humiliated could imply that the person might lose appetite after feeling humiliated. Although losing appetite can cause someone to stay hungry, it does not actually help solve the situation if the person is truly starving.\n7. We can rule out Choice B: hunt and Choice C: sleep because they do not directly relate to procuring food or meeting the requirement of the question.\n8. Therefore, we can find a suitable answer by comparing A: prepared to go against the rest of the choices given B: humiliated, C: sleep, D: hunt, and E: thank god.\n9. Clearly, A is the only choice that does not include a word that means losing appetite or not getting food. This rules out the choices that end with \"ed\", which are options B: hungry, C: slept, D: hunted. It is also the only choice that can be interpreted as getting involved in action or an activity, which is exactly what the person must do to get food. By preparing to go, she will likely get involved in something that will satisfy her hunger.\n10.

Choices: A: johnson B: miller C: smith D: walker E: wright\nRationales: Let's start off by analyzing the question,\n\"Mary has recently moved to a new region. Her last name is what?\"\n1. The question is presenting Mary as a person whose last name is something and who has recently moved to a region.\n2. This can suggest that there's a connection between the two items.\n3. We can interpret that the two items are likely to be some type of relation, maybe a relationship between a person and an area, or perhaps a person's name.\n4. We can analyze the options provided,\n5. A person who has a name \"JOHNSON\" is in some way related to the area named \"MILLER\".\n6. Since \"Johnson\" is a town in the state of Kansas, and Kansas is known for large-scale cattle ranches, there is a strong relationship between a town in Kansas named \"Johnson\" and the production of \"cattle\".\n7. A person who has the name \"MILLER\" also has a relationship with the state of Kansas. \"MILLER\" happens to be a town, county, and an indigenous tribe in Kansas.\n8. The people in Kansas are known to run large-scale cattle ranching operations. Hence, they would be familiar with the term \"Miller\"\n9.

Africa is still one of the most undeveloped what? Choices: A: areas B: nations C: countries D: continents E: nations\nRationales: Rationale: 1. It can be inferred that Africa has not been fully explored and, as a result, is still in its early stages of development.\n2. This leaves us with a choice C, which is Africa, being a continent, cannot be developed as people still need to explore it completely in order to benefit from its resources.\n2. Contrarily, choice D, which represents countries, can be under development as some countries such as Nigeria and Kenya might still be in the infant stages of development.\n1. On the other hand, choice A, which represents African areas, has already been explored extensively and it cannot be under development. \n2. Next, let's look at choices B, which stands for Nation, and E, which stands for Nation. \n3. Africa cannot be a nation because nations are usually made up of multiple countries, and Africa is a continent made up of several countries. \n4.

Furthermore, even if a person believes in god, they may feel ashamed and/or embarrassed and therefore they'd likely not make such a public show of their hunger.\n7. Therefore option E is the most feasible explanation since a hungry person would need to prepare to go somewhere for food.\n8. Given that the person is hungry and has to find food, they are likely not thinking about sleeping at the moment or feeling humiliated for any reason.\n9. Hence, the answer would be E: prepare to go.\nAnswer: E prepare to go\n\nInput: What will likely happen when light reflects from a puddle of water onto a rock? Choices: 1) A: The rock may become wet 2) B: Nothing may happen 3) C: The rock may fracture 4) D: The rock may break into many pieces 5) E: Water droplets may form on the rock\nRationales: We're given a scenario where light reflects off a pool of water onto a rock. The question asks what action is likely to occur.\n1. The rock may become wet implies that we should consider whether water would be present on the rock. However, this could happen only if water droplets form in the first place and the rocks is somehow able to sustain the water as a liquid.\n2. Thus, there would be a water component but not necessarily liquid water dripping on the rock.\n3. The rock may fractures means that a rock may split into several parts.\n4. The rock may break into pieces, which means that a rock would break into many parts.\n5. Therefore, option C: The rock may break or crack is the best answer\nAnswer: C: The rock may crack or break\n\nInput: The student who has done something naughty may get what?

The remaining options all relate to food.  Feeling humiliated or preparing to go to sleep might be actions that happen after eating food, however, they do not produce food, so they are irrelevant.\n7.

Choices:  I: less than seven II: Less than 13, more than 5 III: about 9\nRationales 1. The first thing to note is the question format, specifically that the question ends with the phrase \"how many people?\".\n2. In this prompt, the number of participants is of interest, so we must find the answer that best fits this role.\n3. In this context, the participants of a music concert have to be there physically, so they cannot be represented by the number of individuals that have bought tickets to the concert.\n4. Additionally, it only makes sense to answer \"how many people?\" when the number in question has an actual measurement, so answers that are comparative or non-quantitative cannot be chosen.\n5. Since the answer options given are numbers, it's important to evaluate each one to determine which is the best fit. \n6. The lowest out of all options is less than 7, which could possibly be the case if it is a small, intimate concert that does not have high attendance and no one in the audience is paying.\n7. To find the highest attendance, we add the numbers that are present, in this case, if there are less than 13 people, more than five participants will be there. \n8. Consequently, the answer to the question \"how many people?\" is option 2, as this is the number with the highest overall number of participants present.\n9.

We also know that rough implies unpleasant or difficult. One word that represents a situation that is unpleasant or difficult is tough. Therefore we can conclude that 202 was a tough year. People can say that a tough year has been good as it can teach us toughness.\nAnswer: D : A Good Year. \n\nInput: How can having a bad credit score affect a person?

Choice D: sleep would not help in this situation. If the hunter didn't find any food, he would still be hungry the next day, thus perpetuating the problem.\n7. Lastly, for choice E: prepare to go, the answer would be either A, B, C or D, as it depends on whether the person actually found food.\n8. Choices C and D are the only ones that allow the neolithic hunter to find food and feed themselves. Choice C is preferable over D as it's a more direct approach to the goal of finding food and satisfying the hunger.\n9.

Choices:  What:  A: old habits B: old lovers C: new friends D: old friends E: new cities\nRationales:\n1. The question asks what people often return to after a long absence. \n2. There could be multiple answers to this question: Old habits, old lovers, new friends, old friends or a new city.\n3. However, from the context of the question, the response options are likely to indicate something people return to after being away from it for a long time. \n4. For choice A: old habits: Old habits refer to a general or repeated behavior that a person tends to go back to regularly. \n5.

Choices: A: good buddies B: perfect matches C: like minded D: best friends E: best peosns\nRationales: The question asks about the relationship between two people, and the implication is that the feelings of both people are equally strong. \"Mutual\" means that both people feel strongly about their relationship, which suggests that they are on good terms and in a position to continue that relationship. \n1. A \"buddy\" is a person who is reliable, casual, and comfortable. This conveys a sense of friendship, indicating that the two people in the relationship are good friends.\n2. \"Perfect matches\" refer to two people that are perfectly matched with each other in terms of interests, values, and personalities, which suggests that they have harmonious traits that make them compatible.\n3. \"Like-minded\" is another option, it implies that the two people are similar in nature and views, expressing their beliefs and attitudes in the same way.\n4. \"Best friends\" refer to the best relationship someone can have with another person.

However, in my first year of university, what was I unable to do? Choices: A: Go to the gym B: Meet with friends C: Talk to people D: Order food E: Work out routines\nRationales:1. The question starts by presenting the reason for her wanting to learn Spanish: it was because she took an introductory course on Youtube. \n2. Then, the question describes the reason for her desire to learn Spanish again one year after her first year in university: she could no longer interact with people in Spanish.\n3. So we know she has completed at least one introductory course on Spanish, possibly at her university. \n4. The introductory course could be on Youtube or another online learning platform, or it could be at a designated classroom. \n5. The question mentions she could not interact with the people in Spanish. We know meeting people would not be a problem because of friendship and family. \n6. Therefore, it could mean she tried to talk to people, but she could not. However, ordering food would be possible as one can order online or by a phone call. \n7. The question states talking to people, therefore order food is more likely as a difficulty she faced while taking her introductory course. \n8. Also, talking to people implies talking to strangers.

This suggests that these are the types of actions that a person could take to obtain food. \n7. A person could hunt for food, but there is no inherent guarantee that the effort would work and food would be procured, unless they actually managed to find some. \n8.

The first two choices could imply the gathering of what is available, such as wild plants, berries, or roots, leading to choices B: hunt for or C: feel humiliate.\n7. The last choice, D: sleep, is more indicative of not seeking food because it would solve the problem temporarily, as it would mean the person's hunger would be relieved until they awoke.\n8.

Choices:  a) size b) diet c) color d) smell e) speed\nRationales: This question is an analogy, and when solving an analogy, we must recognize similarities and differences between two pairs of concepts to choose which pair logically corresponds to the one given.\n1. Analyzing this analogy, it is clear that it asks about the differences between a deer and rabbit, and the options given are: size, diet, color, smell, and speed.\n2. The first three options are similar as they relate to the physical (size), appearance (color), and odor (smell) of the deer and rabbit. Therefore, we can remove these options as a distractor.\n3. The remaining two options are related to deer and rabbit's characteristics regarding their diet. Since they both consume plants, we can eliminate option b.\n4. Since the choice c) color is not relevant, we can easily choose a).\n5. Once we eliminate these distractors, we need to think about what distinguishes deer and rabbit from each other.

Additionally, he had to make good decisions, indicating that he was a businessman.\nThe options given include good decisions, more mistakes, good friends, better decisions, or no mistakes.\n\nThe correct answer is E - no mistakes. This choice describes someone who is very confident and knows it, and must make good decisions, but doesn't make any mistakes.\n\nA: good decisions would imply that John was confident in the decisions that he makes. However, if he was confident in his decisions, then he would not be making any mistakes.\n\nB: more mistakes indicates that John was unsure of his decisions, and was likely making more mistakes. Again, it is unlikely that someone who is confident in their decisions is also making mistakes.\n\nC: good friends points to a lack of confidence. Making good decisions implies that one is confident in their decisons and knows that they will not make any mistakes, while having good friends suggests that someone may be confident in their decisions but still make mistakes.\n\nD: better decisions could be considered the correct answer, as making better decisions means being more confident in them.", "answer": " 7"}

He wanted a good way to keep what? Choices: A: his shirt dry B: his tie dry C: his shoes dry D: his socks dry E: his trousers dry\nRationales:\n1. The weather in New York, stated as quite damp, means that it is likely to be raining, misting, or generally unpleasant for activities involving going outside and being exposed to the elements.\n2. It is possible that the question pertains to an activity where clothing is removed.\n3.

Public transportation is the most cost effective means of travel from one state to another. There are a few reasons for this.\n1. Cars are expensive and maintaining them is expensive, which is partly what makes public transportation cheap.\n2. Cars take up a considerable amount of space, while a public transportation can move along with hundreds to millions of passengers in a given day, taking up considerably less space than a vehicle.\n3. Cars may have large costs regarding environmental damage, such as emitting harmful gases, but public transportation costs a lot less, making it much more environmentally friendly.\n4. Another factor to consider is that public transportation can move a greater volume of goods from one place to another.\n5.

Choices: 1. cruel 2. good at sports 3. strict 4. generous\nRationales: The question asks about the kind of teacher who is not a tyrant or hero. Tyrant and hero are opposite polarities. The three main characteristics of a tyrant are cruel, strict, and ungenerous. The two characteristics of a hero are good at sports and generous. To be a bad teacher but not a tyrant, one must have two opposite non-hero traits: cruel and ungenerous, and one opposite non-tyrant trait: strict or good at sports. Because strict and good at sports are similar types, we also check to see if one is one of a kind or the other. If not, strict and/or good at sports are two qualities that would not distinguish a bad teacher from a tyrant and a hero. Therefore, the answer must be in the remaining combination of two polarities of opposites that are different from strictly one and good at sports, cruel and ungenerous.\nAnswer: cruel and ungenerons\n\nInput: Which  is the correct method used for taking someone a survey?

Choice B: hunt for it refers to actively searching for options, such as going on a trip or pursuing a certain type of food.

The options given in regard to this context are: \"hunt for food\" and \"prepare to go\". This implies that they had an understanding of food hunting and traveling.\n14. Therefore, it makes sense that the neolithics would prepare to go to find food.

Choices B and C: hunting for food and feeling humiliated are both actions that could theoretically result in finding food but are too inefficient and risky, respectively, to be practical.\n6. Of the remaining choices, we need to identify an action that, through a series of smaller actions, has the potential to solve the problem.\n7. Choice D: prepare to go should be eliminated as it implies that it is a plan or a course of action that needs to be considered and carried out to solve the problem. A plan of this nature cannot be used to solve the presented problem, as the person is in a situation where there is no time or ability to do this. \n8. Hence, the only remaining option is choice E: prepare to go, which describes a plan of action that needs to take place over time and has a purpose. This describes a course of action that could serve to prepare someone to go out and obtain food, which would be practical in the situation of the provided problem where the neolithic man is in a hurry to find food.\n9.

Similarly, choice B: hunt for the food does not mean look for food on the ground; instead, it refers to seeking food outside the home or area, implying the action of seeking or searching. \n6. However, choosing a food option inside the home area is not feasible as the problem is a problem of being hungry, which indicates that the person has little to no food to eat in the first place. \n7. Hence, looking for food inside the home area is unnecessary as the person's problem is that there is nothing to eat in their home or near their vicinity.\n8.

We interpret \"really fun book\" to mean \"fun\" in the sense of entertaining and \"book\" to be referring to a text, such as a book, manual, report, or the like and since we are looking for an answer that relates to a text, book is our focal keyword.\n3. \"Share\" can be taken to imply that the text is meant to be read together by two people.\n4. \"Share it with me now\" is ambiguous, it can mean either that you're withholding the text from me in the sense that you aren't sharing it with me when you should be, or you're putting off sharing the text with me because you're saving it for a later occasion.\n5.

Some might be willing to risk life for the chance of food, but most of us would prefer a food item without the accompanying risk.\n7. Choice D: feeling humiliated is not a viable solution either, as it would lead to hunger rather than feeding them. Similarly, choice E: preparing to go would require physical and mental effort to make the preparations that would then lead to the person not being hungry. This does not answer the question, which is to find a way to be immediately fed.\n8. Therefore, the best solution is to choose option C: eating food.

In contrast, Choice C: feel humiliation seems to have enough relevance to the original problem. If this person was feeling desperate or sad because they were not able to find food, perhaps this emotional pain could lead to some form of action that produces food.\n8.

Typically, an individual with a deep-seated (irrational) fear will experience phobias.\n4. Phobias are extreme fears of a particular situation, object, or phenomenon which tends to interfere with the person's life and limit their daily functioning.\n5.

We are left with Choice E: prepare to go which is the solution that matches the provided details. The option states for a preparation to happen before finding food, which is an activity required to find food, thus leading to a solution for hunger.\n7. Based on the above, the correct choice to solve the problem of hunger presented in the question is Choice E: prepare before going.\n8. This option relates to the neolithic people who hunted for food by preparing for hunting and going to the hunt.\n9. Therefore the answer should be option E.\nAnswer: E.

Choices: a: a server b: a writer c: an engineer d: an investor e: a professor\nRationales:\n 1. A question is asking about a new job that will require focus on the task and avoid socializing.\n2. However, from the statement below, it is known that for any new job, it is best to keep it casual.\n3. A causal job would mean working in an office that does not have a strict dress code or formal requirements.\n4. There are several different occupations and roles that one can consider for a casual job. \n5. In this case, let\u2019s assume that the given choices are specific to a person holding a casual job.\n6. When a new job is obtained, it may require some social interaction and networking. \n7. However, the new candidate is asked to \u201cjust focus on your own work.\u201d\n8.

Choices: A: service B: food C: staff D: prices E: noise\nRationales: This task asks for the correct title that can be assigned to Mr Jones' complaint, choosing from A: service, B: food, C: staff, D: price, or E: noise.\n1. Let's start by determining what kind of situation Mr Jones is describing by parsing the phrase \"has come\", as this could refer to a visit, an arrival, or a situation.\n2. Mr Jones is not referred to as \"coming\" or \"having come\"; therefore, these suggestions cannot be used to interpret \"come\".\n3. We can, however, use the phrase \"come to your office\" to determine a location they are talking about.\n4. If Mr Jones has arrived at the office, that means he has been there multiple times.\n5. An office is where people work, which in turn, suggests that they have either been using it or have been serving some of its workers.\n6. By examining this information, we can infer that \"office\" is an institution that has been working for some time.\n7. In this situation, the word \"service\" would most likely fit the title given, as the person has been coming to the office to complain about a service he has been receiving/\nAnswer: A: Service\n\nInput: The most exciting part of shopping is being surrounded by what?

Similarly, Choice C: feeling humiliated makes little sense here as this is not likely to help the person find hunger.\n10. Choice B: hunt for sustenance is the one of the two possible logical choices that would make sense to a hungry person.\n11. However, we are looking for a \"what\" (i.e. a choice that does something) as opposed to a \"why\" (i.e choice that reveals a mindset).\n12.

First we look at the synonyms of kindness and respect.\n2. \"Respect\" may mean to express esteem of, honour, respect, to have regard for, venerate, reverence. \"Kindness\" means the action of being kind, the condition of being kind, benevolence, generosity.\n3. The synonyms of \"being kind\" is \"being kind, generosity, benevolent, loving, and tender-hearted.\" These words share the same root: love.\n4. Therefore, one could say that Sam has love.\n5.

We consider that choice E does not fit the problem because it is not a process, but only a state - sleeping is a temporary and passive state of no action.\n8.

{"text": "because it is the action of one's thoughts, not of their actions. \n5. Similarly, Choice B: hunt for some food is not a sensible option as the person is already too hungry to hunt for food, given the time constraints required to be neolithic, we reasonably infer that they would already have been unable to perform this action, in this scenario. \n6. Therefore, from the two choices, only choice C: feel humiliation is sensible. It is a choice that would lead to an action which may procure food.\n7. Feeling humiliated may lead to the person apologizing for their lack of food, which may generate an act of kindness from another person who will provide them food or help them procure food.\n8. The final choice given is E: prepare to go. Although they need to go somewhere to procure food, they would be doing so to find a source of food to prevent themselves from starving. So, this would be a last resort and not the most sensible course of action. Hence, it can be excluded, leaving Choices: A, B, C, D.\n9. We again infer that the person is too hungry to engage in action when it comes to food, except for making their last humble request, in the choice C. \n10. The choice that best fits this description is C: feel humiliate. This means a person may feel desperate or helpless enough to feel humiliated by their state of lack of food. \n11.

C: a good income D: a good relationship with the manager E: a good history in business\nRationales: Given that we are speaking about a loan from a bank, it is important to take into account bank conditions, to which the options should apply. \n1. A good credit history would likely mean that not only the borrower can pay back what they borrowed but also that they do not accrue very high charges or fees. This relates to Banks, as it means less risk for both parties involved.\n2. An official job indicates an obligation for the worker to pay", "answer": " 24"}

Choices: 1: Americans support their local sports teams. 2: We have to use something to fill up the extra space in our lives. 3: It's the only way to fill up our extra time during the day. 4: I think it's because, while there are sports channels, most people only watch them once or twice a year during the Super Bowl. 5: Americans like being entertained by things they do when they eat lunch or go to the bathroom.\nRationales: The correct answer would reflect the best reason behind why sports TV is the favorite entertainment from home for the majority of Americans.\n1. Choice 1 states that Americans like American football. This implies the reason why sports TV is the preferred entertainment in their homes is because they support their nearby teams. However, while sports channels may focus on American sports teams, not all sports TV shows are geared toward local sports teams.\n2. Choice 2 says \"We have to use something to use our times to fill up excess space at home\". This does not directly answer the question because it does not specify why Americans prefer sports TV over other forms of entertainment, but just says that they have to use something to support their extra time at home.\n3. Choice 3 implies that Americans like to fill up their spare time at home with sports TV instead of spending it on anything else, but this does not explain why it is the most popular form instead of other options.\n4.

Choices: \n< Choices start -\nA: Left\nB: Right\nC: Backwards\nA: Right\nB: Forward\nC: Backwards \n< Choices end >\n\nRationales:1. The question is about the direction in which a revolution is likely to go, with the choices given being left, right, backward and forward.\n2. The given choices can be understood by their context and each of them conveys a particular meaning in this context.\n3. Choice \u201cForward\u201d or \u201cBackward\u201d could imply that the revolution goes in the same or opposite directions as the ones shown in the given choices. \n4. If \u201cBackward\u201d is chosen, the sentence \u201cA great leader leads a revolution which direction is the revolution to go:\u2026\u201d would be misleading, as most revolutions try to move forward, not backward. Hence, the answer should be \u201cBackward\u201d and not \u201cBackward\u201d.\n5. Given the context, in which forward is implied as positive and backward is implied as negative, to get left, one has to turn left from the forward direction.

Choices: A: relax B: make conversation C: be alone D: do math E: stay calm\nRationales: The question asks about the nervous girl's situation and her friend who is helping her. \nFirst, it can be inferred that the girl must be new to a certain situation, like meeting a group of new people. \nIn such situations, it is common for new members to feel nervous and a bit lost.\nNext, the question asks about her friend who is helping. \nThe friend is described as someone with whom the new person feels comfortable. \nThey are good friends and know each other well. This implies that the friend's intention is to help the new person. \nChoices A (relax), B (make conversation), C (be alone), D (do math), and E (stay calm) might be considered options in this scenario.\n\nNow, it can be infered from the previous information that the new person can not relax (i.e. option A), talk (i.e. choice B) because they don't know what to say to the new people, be alone (i.e. Option C) because they might seem lonely or lost, and do math (Option E).\n\nFinally, option D, stay calm would be best because the girl is already calm, and the girl's friend is just being helpful, the girl friend is not supposed to be worried and the girl friend is always there when the girl friend needs anything.\nAnother factor that supports option D is the", "answer": " 18"}

Choice B: hunt for a food is the type of action that is needed to satisfy hunger and procure food.\n7. Lastly, we narrow down to the remaining choices and identify which option matches the context given by the question.\n8. The context of the question is about the action of neolithic people to solve their problems.\n9. Therefore we can eliminate choices by eliminating those actions that are not relevant to the context, only choices: A: thank god, C: feel humiliation, D: sleep.\n10. We can also eliminate choices that are not in line with the characteristics of the neolithic people. It is reasonable to assume that people from that era would find ways to satisfy their needs through procuring food, and not through praying to gods. \n11. This leaves us with one answer: Hunt for food.\n12. According to Merriam-Webster, a choice is an act of choosing or the result of one's choice. \n13. Hence, we can reason that \"hunt for food\" is the answer.  \nAnswer: Hunt for food\n\nInput: In the early ages,  people needed to gather their own clothing materials.

Choice B: hunt for is a verbal noun which requires a subject. Feel humiliated would require that the hungry person feels humiliated.  It wouldn't be practical for the person to decide to feel humiliated; thus the question is asking for a verb, not a noun.\n9. However, the problem does not require a subject. Therefore, the person, as an agent, would not be able to hunt, the object of the hunt.  This leaves us with choice C: hungry.\n10. Hungrily would mean feeling hungry.

Every year, there was a large surplus of  what? Choices: A: fishing B: animals C: fish D: plants E: crops\nRationales:1. The question asks us to name an ecological problem faced by a farmer that has a surplus of fish.\n2. Fishing is a common solution used for this ecological problem as fishing reduces the number of fish, providing a more balanced population in the environment.\n3. This means that to name a possible solution, we need to narrow down the choices to animals, fish, plants, and crops.\n4.

Her goal is to find a new friend with whom she could hang around and spend all her time.\n2. This way, we'll find a good match for Dot.\n3. Now that we have determined what we need, let's think about why she needs it. Dot thinks that friends' companionship and company have positive influence on one's social skills and life quality.\n4. This explains why she looks for a friend who could become a great companion.\n5. In case if it was a bad or fake friend, then the person would be exposed to their negative features and this would affect Dot.\n6.

Choices B: hunting for food and D: sleep can be possible options for finding food, but are unlikely to be feasible solutions since the neolithic period is a period where hunting was not a prominent way of obtaining food.\n6. There are no mentions of the person's access to tools or technology, so the actions that could be more plausible are C and E. \n7. Option C: feeling humiliated is not directly relevant to solving hunger, but perhaps it could lead to someone seeking help and obtaining food as a result.\n8. Option E: preparing to go seems like a logical course of action that a hungry individual would consider while looking for food. While traveling, the neolithic hunter could acquire the means to feed themselves.\n9. So out of the choices given, the most likely solution to the problem is E: preparing to travel and finding food from this journey. \n10.

There's more to this question than what? Choices: A: meets the eye, B: you look at, C: you see, D: the first look, E: everything you know\nRationales:  1. The question asks what there might be to a book cover that your dad mentions more than meets the eye.\n2. This implies that there is something more to the book cover than initially meets the eye, and your dad is hinting at that something.\n3. Out of all the options, only three seem relevant to this question: \"more to the first look\", \"more to what you see\", and \"more to a book cover than what you know\". \n4. Option A: \"more to meets the eye\" does not make sense in this context. The answer should be more general and not specific to the first look.\n5. Option B, \"more to what you look at\" doesn't make sense either. It's ambiguous in that it could refer to the cover, the inside of the book, or both.\n6.

{"text": "to the problem as it would not provide any immediate relief from hunger, and Choice B: hunting for food, implies actively pursuing and killing another animal. \n5. If the neolithic hunter only had what was necessary for survival, hunting must necessarily involve killing. Therefore, it would be impractical and insane to engage in hunting in this scenario.\n6. So the only choice that could lead to food for the neolithic huntsman is Choice C: feeling humiliated.\n7. Humiliation is defined as a strong feeling of embarrassment or shame. \n8. In order to get food which is the basis of the problem at hand, one needs empathy. \n9. The term empathy means the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. \n10.

There are times when the car is moving suddenly at a high speed, and the seat belt restrains the body.\n8. Choice C needs a careful thinker.\n9. There is a danger of collision with another car when the car stops suddenly.\n10. In order to minimize this danger, we may want to take off our seat belt, which will increase our reaction speed.\n11. We would need only to remove our seat belt then.\n12.

Choices:  B: money C: credit card D: card E: ticket, license\nRationales:1. The question provides a scenario where the police found a wallet, and the wallet was empty.\n2. It then asks which item was missing from the wallet. \n3. The first thing that comes to mind is the money, but we also need to look at the other possible items that could be missing.\n4. Choice B (money) is the most likely choice. The question is about what was taken from the wallet and choice B matches the description of what would be in the wallet.\n5. Money is the only thing from a wallet that would be considered valuable since it is something that one could actually steal out of the wallet.\n6. Choices A, C, D, E are not directly related to the missing wallet items, as they don\u2019t give a specific item that was stolen from a wallet.\n7. While a credit card and a driver's license could both be considered valuable, a stolen license isn\u2019t likely to make the news since it could still be used by others.\n8. Thus, we can rule out C (credit card) and E (ticket, license). Thus the answer is B: money.\nAnswer: B. Money\n\nInput: They had a special meal as part of the week's menu.

{"text": ", as it would only provide emotional relief and does not translate into actual food.\n5. Choice C: feelings of humiliation may be experienced by the person before, during, or after being hungry. However, feeling humiliated is not directly related to providing food.\n6. Choice D: sleeping is a possible solution due to decreased hunger, which may or may not induce the person to wake up to find food.\n7. Since the question is looking for a direct solution to satisfying hunger rather than a longer-term solution that would indirectly resolve hunger, choice E: prepare to go would be the most suitable choice.\n8. Choice E: prepare to go can be understood as a type of action, similar to what is expected from the hungry person.\n9. When one is hungry, one's immediate response is to locate food. Therefore, by choosing to prepare to go, the neolithic persona is most likely taking steps towards accomplishing the solution of finding food to satisfy the need for sustenance. \n10. Based on the analysis above, preparation to go is the solution the hungry person would undertake. So the answer is E: prepare to go.\nAnswer: E/17/prepare to go and E/1: prepare to go \nAnother way (using a different wording) to answer this is:\nE/11/prepare to go\nInput: The teacher asked the 7th graders to choose who they would like to be their principal.

{"text": "in this case and is unlikely to address the person's food problem. \n5. We can rule out Choice B: hunting for food because the person's solution shouldn't be dependent on lucky guesses or being lucky enough to find a catch.\n6. Choice D: sleeping, is not an action but a state of being and does not provide a solution with the right action to solve the problem.\n7. Finally we consider Choices C and E: feel humiliated and prepare to go. \n8. Both these choices could be possible solutions, however, we find they are not very feasible or practical solutions for the problem of hunger as a method to provide food.\n9. Choice C: feel humiliation is not a feasible method for getting food as it just leads to a downward spiral of negative feelings. \n10. Lastly, Choice E: prepare to go could mean finding food or just going away from the problem of hunger.\n11. In this case, preparing to go, might mean moving away from the area where the problem occurred and going to find food.\n12. Hence, the most relevant solution to this problem of finding food to solve ones' hunger is Choice E: prepare go. \n13.

This solution matches the problem and the actions which would be considered by a hungry person who knows that there is no other option. \n8. Therefore, the answer must be choice B: Hunting for food.\nAnswer: B: hunting for food\n\nInput: In what city does the best opera company perform? Choices:  F: A. Paris B. Chicago C. Berlin D. San Francisco E. New York\nRationales:1. The question provides an evaluation, asking which city performs the best opera.\n2. The best is usually associated with the absolute best.\n3. So the question suggests that the best opera company should be the top one in a city, \n4. We must then consider the given cities to determine the best one, which would then offer the best opera. \n5. For this reason, the choice F: A. Paris can be eliminated because although Paris is known for having a variety of interesting and diverse operas; \n6. There are numerous cities with more spectacular shows, as indicated by B. Chicago, C. Berlin, and D. San Francisco, all of which perform more elaborate and sophisticated opera than Paris.\n7. Choice E. New York is the only one left, which has been acknowledged as the best city in the world for opera. \n8.

Option B: hunting for food indicates that the neolithc person has enough courage, strength, and determination to be able to search for it. Hunting is therefore the most appropriate option.\n6. Options C and D indicate emotions, which do not help find food solutions.\n7. Option E: prepare to go sounds vague and does not specify the activity or action it implies. \n8. Finally, based on the reasons above, we choose B: hunting for food as the best option to solve the implied problem.\nAnswer: B: Hunting for food\n\nInput: How would someone be describing a person who is incredibly confident and doesn't care at all what people think of them? Choices: A: arrogant B: humble C: shy D: extroverted E: introverted\nRationales: The following information can be inferred from the context of the question:\n1. \"incredibly confident\" implies that the person has the ability to express themselves comfortably, without any fear.\n2. They also don't care about what other people think, indicating that they are unafraid to express their thoughts to an audience.\n3. In contrast, describing someone else as \"incredibly shy\" could mean that the person avoids having conversations in public or meeting new people because they get embarrassed easily.\n4. Therefore, the most appropriate adjective that could describe a person's behavior based on the given adjective is \"confident\", not the adjective given in the question. But we should be careful because the word choice could be too straightforward, hence we need to consider other options to provide a better explanation.\n5. Based on the discussion above, another adjective that could describe the same behavior is \"shy\", because it conveys similar but subtler aspects than \"incredibly shyness\" like awkwardness, timidity, self-consciousness, and withdrawing from attention.\n6. So, choosing adjectives that describe the personality is not straightforward, hence other options should be considered.\n7. The question is \"What adjectives would someone use to describe someone who is incredibly confident, but doesn't care at what people think of them\" and not \"What is a person who is", "answer": " 1050"}
{"text": "because this option assumes that the individual has faith in a higher being and is willing to accept that the god can provide food.\n5.

Next, Choice B: hunting for food, which is likely to occur in the event of people being hungry. However, this involves risking a life, and it requires knowledge or skill which might not be available to people from the Neolithic era who were primarily subsistence farmers.\n7. Next, Choice C: feeling humiliated would not be a solution because this was a form of punishment rather than a way to deal with a problem.\n8. Next, Choice D: sleeping might not be a solution either since it would simply prolong the period of time that the person is without food.\n9. Finally, the last option is Choice E: preparing to go, which simply means planning the future by making a certain move or setting off on a journey to find food. It could be that this was the case with the neolithic people who may have been hunter-gatherers during this time.\n10.

The question tells us that someone does what every night. It is important to note that the word \"when\" would imply that the person does what (or rather the action stated in this case: going to bed) every single night. Since going to bed is a night activity the correct answer would be C, or go to the bathroom, and D, or eat.\nAnswer: C or D\n\nInput: An adult has a lower metabolism than a teenager.

In other words, these two solutions only show that they act out a specific behaviour. \n7. Choice D: sleeping would not help the neolithic people solve their hungry problem as they would not be able to eat while sleeping. \n8.

The purpose of a Fiction Book is to entertain (it has an interesting story) and it's intended audience is a child or youth. \nIt's best sellers status is not important, as it's not necessary for a book to be a best seller to be a fiction book (think of a horror book for example); nor the purpose (think of fantasy books for example) or the intended audience (this changes from fiction to fiction).\nAlso, the fact that it's amazing is another clue that the book will be entertaining (that it will pass the time of the reader), as you can only expect amazing from entertaining fiction books.\nWith the previous, the type we will write on the answer will be C (Auto Biography).\nAnswer", "answer": " 304"}

From this information, one can reason that in addition to physically finding the food, he would also need a plan/strategy. \n6. However, Choice B: \"feel humiliated\" is not a plan that would lead to getting food. It is more of an emotional response to not having enough food to eat. He will likely feel discouraged about his current circumstances.\n7.

We have to consider all answers to see which one corresponds to the neolithic man's solution to the problem most accurately. \n9.

We can use the keywords \"making hats\" to narrow down our options.\n3. As a result, choices D and E, which are stores that sell hats, would be out of scope. \n4. From the remaining choices, the word \"boutique\" can be removed as an option since \"boutiques\" are not factories or warehouses where hats are made.\n5. After examining the remaining choices, the following are out.\n6. A: factory - The phrase \"specializes in making hats\" could suggest that the business has factories where they make the hats.\n7. C: shop - The phrase \"specialize in making hats\" does not describe shops that sell hats.\n8.

Choice: A: dentists B: beauticians C: doctors D: nurses E: cosmetologists\nRationales: In order to answer this question, the first thing that needs to be analysed is the differences between the professions that are being compared.\n\nBoth dentists and beauticians are involved in maintaining physical attractiveness. The former is concerned mainly with teeth, gums, and oral health in general, whereas the other is primarily responsible for the appearance of hair, skin, and nails.\n\nHowever, as can be seen from the options stated, there are more differences beyond physical appearance.\n\nFor instance, dentists can be differentiated from beauticians because of their medical background and specialised equipment; dentists require specialist training and usually work on a patient\u2019s oral structure. Beauticians, unlike dentists, do not rely on any medical equipment, and the treatments they usually do are aesthetically focused. As a result of their particular specialisation and educational backgrounds, beauticians have to study for longer than cosmetologists do.\n\nFurthermore, it can be inferred that dentists look after the health of their clients, whereas beauticians are concerned with the aspect of appearance.\n\nBeauticians are less likely, as is shown in the options, to have a medical background or to work with equipment as a dentist would, and they are more concerned with enhancing the appearance of their clients, as opposed to focusing on their health.\n\nHence, a person would have to be concerned with appearances beyond just physical health to be a beautician, indicating that", "answer": " 120"}

{"text": "to the problem of finding food as it is not a direct or actionable way to get food. \n5. So, we can reject choice A. \n6. Now, we consider the meaning of \"hunting\" and \"preparing to go\" to determine if these actions would be appropriate choices to solve the problem. \n7. \"Hunting\" usually involves searching for animals or tracking them down to capture and eat. This implies that the neolithical person would have to exert some sort of physical effort in order to procure food. \n8. However, since the neolithical age person was not able to survive by gathering food in the wild, we can assume that the person would not be able to find food by hunting. \n9. \"Preparing to go\" means getting ready to travel or go on some journey. This term itself does not necessarily indicate a pursuit of food. \n10. Finally, we consider the meaning and context of the term \"sleep\". In this case, it would probably refer to a period of unconsciousness or rest. \n11. However, there is no information in the question that suggests this is an appropriate response to hungry. \n12. Based on these criteria, we determine that this person would not use sleep to solve the food problem.\n13. Finally, since none of the remaining options satisfy the requirements or provide a plausible solution to the problem, we must conclude that \"hunting for food\" would likely be their solution.\n14.

Choices: A: a fresh pair of eyes B: a good book C: a new challenge D: to think more E: a vacation\nRationales:1. This problem statement asks the question to identify a way to overcome thinking that hasn't produced any creative ideas. The question asks for a particular type of thinking or way of getting ideas, rather than a method for generating ideas in general. \n2. It is important to read the question carefully in order to clearly understand the meaning of the concept. This is because the questions can take the form of \"how can I overcome thinking that hasn' have any creative ideas?\" or \"how can I overcome a shortage of ideas?\". \n3. In this case, the question is about overcoming thinking that have produced few or no creative ideas in some form. It may also be phrased: \"I have no creative ideas\"\n4. Let's analyze the statements given:\n5. \"A fresh pair of eyes\" refers to someone else who can look at a problem from a different perspective by providing a new set of perspectives from which to evaluate. A fresh pair of eyes does not contribute to ideas; it is only useful for identifying them. \n6. Instead of thinking of different ways to solve a problem, a \u201cgood book\u201d might inspire the creative thinker to think outside the box.\n7.

{"text": "because a person of this cultural era probably wouldn't know a lot about religion.\n5. In practice, religious sentiments typically don't directly generate resources for people to consume.\n6. Next, we consider Choice B: hunt for Food. This option is a reasonable solution to the problem because hunting is a commonly accepted cultural practice in prehistoric times, especially among the neolithic people.\n7. Choice B is thus the best answer to the problem, since a person in that era would hunt in order to find food.\n8. The other choices are either too far-fetched or don't explicitly relate to the problem.\n9. The choices D and E are not the best solution to the problem.\n10. Choice D: sleep could be a possible solution to the problem if the person is truly hungry. However, a prehistoric person would probably do more than just sleep.\n11. Choice E: prepare to go sounds like an action that would lead a person to find something to eat.\n12. However, the problem already states that the person is hungry, therefore, they'd need to wait until they get food rather than prepare to go.\n13. Choice C: feel humiliation doesn't match the situation in the question.

At first glance, we can see that the question is asking us to identify the most appropriate answer concerning the best driving force of successful entrepreneurs. 2. The answer given options suggest either \"motivation\", \"passion\", or \"patience\". 3. However, the most suitable answer does not belong to any of these three options, it is actually the fourth option: \"desire\". \n\nThis is because although each of the options presented is likely to be an asset of an entrepreneur, their importance varies depending on the specific person the question is asking about. \n\nFor example, a person may be very passionate about their dream, but their desire is not big enough to push them to action. \n\nAlternatively, they may lack motivation, but they still have enough desire to fulfill their dream. Similarly, their lack of patience may lead them to quit.\n\nSo, in order to determine which one of the given options holds the correct answer, the question needs to be more specific, and that is \"the most successful [entrepreneurs] are often driven by.\"\n\nAs we know, successful is an adjective that describes the highest level of achievement in something, therefore, it has to be applied to a noun that describes success; it is not related to passion, motivation, or desire;\n\nAs for what the question is in fact asking, we are presented with'most successful' and 'entrepreneurs',", "answer": " 100"}

Choices:  city street, expressway, interstate, superhighway\nRationales: The question states that the normal speed for cars on a road is 65 mph, and asks what type of highway that is. \n\n1. First, we need to identify the type of road that has a normal speed of 65 mph. The answer can be found in the choices given in the question.\n2. Examine the choices closely to find a road that is normally driven at a speed of 65mph.\n3. We recognize that choice B is an expressway, an urban highway with limited access points, not a normal place to drive at this speed.\n4. Hence, only the other three choices remain and we have to identify which one of them is most closely related to the normal speed of 60mph (65mph < 70mph)\n5. The other three choices are: interstate, superhighways, and city streets. Interstates and city streets are connected with the rest of the country, however, they are not limited access routes, as is choice B. Further, we know that interstate refers to a highway system with national connection, while city streets refer to local roads.\n6. From this, we see that superhighways stand out as the most likely answer. \n7. Superhighways are specifically roads used to transport goods via freight and are usually limited access roads with high speed limits. Hence, they are the best option for the speed limit mentioned in the question.\n8. The answer, therefore, is C: superhighway.\nAnswer: C", "answer": " 4"}

Choice E: prepare to go and go indicates a general response or direction that the person might take after being hungry, but this is not the only solution and may not necessarily provide a resolution to food problems.\n9. Meanwhile, option B: hunt for the food provides a more specific and practical method to resolve food scarcity.\n10. Therefor, this choice is the best one to solve the problem of hunger and the correct answer is B: hunt.\nAnswer: B: hunt\n\nInput: A man's eyes have what? Choices: A: water B: milk C: saliva D: tears E: blood\nRationales: First let's examine an important component that has to do with our eyes. This component is our tear or our \"tears\".\n1. According to the scientific classification of our \"tears\", they fall under mucosal secretions.\n2. From this definition, one may assume that our \"tears\" are not just made of water, but have at least some percentage of it in its composition.\n3. And this is evident in the question because our \"tears\" usually come out of our eyes when we are sad. \n4. We all shed \"tears\" from our eyes; however, this \"tear shedding\" process is not triggered by just the simple presence of water. \n5. There are also other elements that come into the equation that results in \"tear shedding\".\n6. And with the remaining options that are B, C, and E; it is clear that only D: tears matches the question's premise. In particular, E: blood is incorrect because blood is normally not present in our \"tears\", unlike tears.\n7. Therefore the answer must be D: tears.\nAnswer: D; tears\n\nInput: You can't do anything,  but what can you do? Choices: A", "answer": " 5"}

However it's questionable whether \"hunting\" is the best course of action, as hunting requires skill and the resources to obtain the food, thus not everyone has the ability to hunt.\n9. \"Prepare to go\" is more likely an appropriate wording as it indicates that they are going out to find food, not bringing food to them.\n10. The action which best matches with obtaining food on their own and is most realistic in the context of the problem is B: \"prepare to go\".\n11.

But what is involved in the \"hunting\" of food is not an action, but a task.\n7. A task is a sequence of steps that leads to a goal.\n8. Furthermore, there is no specific action involved in doing a task.\n9. Therefore B) Hunt for food and C) hunts for food cannot be the action that was performed to deal with hunger and are thus excluded.\n10. The remaining choices are A: Sleep and B: Prepare to go.\n11. However, \"sleeping\" can be an action or a behavior, but it does not directly solve a problem or attain a goal.\n12. So the options are left A: Sleep and Prepare to go,\n13. The term \"hunting\", as defined earlier, can mean different actions. Examples include making dinner, picking fruit from a tree, or gathering firewood.\n14. The action of \"Hunting\" can be categorized under \"Preparation\", the latter of which is a term with a wider meaning.\n15. In this context \"Preparing to go\" is the best choice because it involves the most actions that can lead to solving the problem.\n16.

Additionally, we consider the idea of preparing to go somewhere; although it may seem appropriate, there is no clear direction implied in this answer, and therefore, it does not appear feasible.\n6. Choice D: feel humiliated is something that would be experienced when going through a challenge, for example, feeling humiliated if one fails an exam. This does not refer to the act of finding food,  so it is eliminated.\n7. Hence the only answer that can possibly lead to a solution is choice E: prepare to go.\n8. The answer \"prepare to go\" describes an action plan that requires a specific effort, with the aim to collect food.\n9. It does not indicate where this effort might lead to but, since this person is neolithic, and lived in the era of gathering and hunting, we can rule out an idea of shopping in the supermarket as it is impractical.\n10. Therefore, we should take into consideration the ideas of gathering and hunting.\n11. This idea implies that gathering and hunting require planning and effort and are a common solution to satiate the lack of proper food.\n12. Based on the reasoning provided we can conclude that the best possible answer is E: prepare to go; the act of planning a trip and preparing to go hunting or gathering is the only way that the neolithical person could have satisfied their need for food.\nAnswer: E, prepare to go.\n\nInput: I have a problem.

Choices: 1) kill the killer 2) die a slow painful death 3) save a child 4) leave the house and call cops 5) live happily ever after\nRationales: One should identify the protagonist's goal or objective in the film.\n1. We see that the only character who is identified as a protagonist is Jane in the question. \n2. Jane's goal or objective is to protect the children and escape the house. \n3. Among the choices given, we see an action to help other people in choices 3), 5) and 4). Actions that help others are not aligned with Jane's goal.\n4. Choice 4) does not save any children as Jane is too late leaving the house.\n5. The choices not related to objective or goal will lead to unsatisfying ending. \n6. Among the choices that are related to achieving objective or goal, Choice 3) is most aligned.

However, the question mentions that the person is already hungry, implying that this is not a viable action. \n6. Thus, we are only left with two options: choice C: feeling humiliated and choice E: preparing to go. \n7. Now, let' see how these actions relate to the procurement and consumption of food. feeling humiliated would not yield food, while preparing to go might involve walking to seek food, which is not the answer.

Choices:  A. very dangerous B. dangerous C. harmless D: extremely dangerous E.  not dangerous\nRationales: The question states that the car accident is not at \"all\" dangerous.\n1. If something is at all, it is not completely or totally not possible.\n2. This can be seen through the following sentence \"I am not at all happy.\" In this case, it means that the person is not completely happy.\n3. This can also be expressed in numbers as \"1 is at most 25.\" This means that a minimum of 25 is 25 or greater.\n4. Similarly, we can conclude from the question if all is used to qualify a noun, it means that it is not true or it may result in a contradiction. So, the word all is the polar opposite of no.\n5. Therefore, we can assume something is \"non-dangerous\" if it is not at all.\n6. If the accident was \"dangerous\" it would result in \"danger\" if used as a noun. Danger means that there is some kind of risk or peril present.\n7. As we see, all is associated with non-dangerous or not dangerous while dangerous is associated with peril.\n8.

It means to yawn repeatedly, uncontrollably, or unintentionally.\n2. So, when someone is yawning out of controls, it would be considered a negative situation, because it doesn't look good and they are uncomfortable.\n3. Here are our options, A: yawn, B: stare, C: slap, D: Ignore, E: look away.\n4. A: yawn is the action of opening your mouth and breathing in or out deeply and inhiring while yawning. \n5. So, if someone is trying to yawn out of control, it would be strange to yawn back at them.\n6. B: stare is the act of looking fixedly, especially for a long time.\n7.

Furthermore, it would be unhealthy and unwise to dwell on one's own embarrassment rather than focusing on finding something to eat.\n8. Choice E: preparing to go looks like an incomplete choice, but could be taken to mean preparing to leave the situation that's causing the problem, like a dungeon or a jail.\n9. The other choices do not explicitly suggest some form of escape or exodus. The purpose behind such an act would be to remove oneself from the unfavorable circumstances.\n10. Lastly, choice E is the most practical and accurate option. \n11.

What will most likely happen to John tomorrow? Choices: \nA: become hungry B: gain weight C: get fat D: gain weight E: feel good\nRationales:  1. The question asks what will most likely happen to someone (John) who did not go to the\ngym. \n2. In this case, John is described as someone who did not go to gym. \n3. One may assume that because he did not go to the GYM, he probably did not do any exercise or was\nphysically inactive in general. \n4. If a person does not go to the gYM, he is more likely to become fat, not gain weight because gaining\nweight is a more general term not always associated with becoming fat.\n5.

Similarly, choice B hunt for food is unlikely to yield any results for the following reasons: \n6. first, if the neolithic hunts for food they would need some tools or weapons to do so, however, there is no indication in the question what tools the person has access to.\n7. Second, they may need to have some knowledge about hunting, but again, the question does not give us any information about the person's hunting skills.\n8. Therefore, this choice does not directly address the problem of being hungry.\n9.

Option B is to hunt for food, but this is assuming the person to be hunting game, which is most likely to be a hunter-gatherer who is hunting animals or fruits/vegetables.  \n6. There is a possibility that choice B refers to fishing, as \"neolithic\" refers to the period between the Stone Age and Iron Age, which would be roughly 4000-2000 BC.\n7. During this time period, many cultures practiced agriculture, which could mean the individual had access to food farming. In that case, this person may have simply had to \"prepare to go\", which is an action that requires the least amount of knowledge.\n8. Among all the options given in the question, it is the most logical as it is the most universally adaptable answer to the situation of looking for food.\n9. Moreover, the neolithic period lasted for approximately 4000 years, meaning that humans have been farming for long enough to have mastered the art.\n10.

Choices:  I: with great excitement A: with unwavering precision II: with extreme vigor B: with great pride, C: with great anxiety D: with great fear,\nRationales:1. First, we need to determine how we would use the term \"fantastic\" in the sentence. \n2. We could either use the word to express excitement, vigor, anxiety, or fear about something. \n3. Based on this, we need to find which of the given choices is most appropriate for expressing either excitement or anxiety. \n4. To be excited about something, one needs to believe or be hopeful that something positive or good is going to happen.\n5. However to be anxious, one needs to be worried because of a particular fear.\n6. Since we would not normally be anxious about a positive event or experience like going to take the exam, this rule applies with confidence.\n7. Therefore we need to find out what choices refer to positive anticipation or expectation.\n8. Among the given options, choice A: with unwaveraing precision, B: with great pride and C: with great fear, they are all positive traits. On the other hand, D: with great anxiety is not a positive trait, but we know that this is the one we cannot choose because it's not what \"fantastic\" would mean when describing students' feelings regarding an exam.\n9.

Choices:  F1 - front yard F2 - backyard F3 - inside F4 - balcony F5 - around house\nRationales: The question describes a specific type of flower that is being placed indoors.\n1. Since flowers are most often used to enhance the appearance of a garden or outside area, we will exclude options F5 and F4. Flowers are mainly used to beautify gardens or areas around a house like a balcony or patio, they would not go inside a house.\n2. It is more realistic to place this kind of flowers indoors, rather than in a yard or on a balcony.\n3. Options F2 and F3 give rise to two possibilities regarding where these flowers would go.\n4. F3 suggests that the flowers go outside. However, this is contrary since this type of flowers are supposed to be inside, not outside.\n5. Hence, the only remaining choice is F1 which states that these flowers can be put in front of one\u2019s yard. \n6.

The question leaves out Choices D: sleep and E: prepare to go, which implies that a choice needs to be made from the remaining options.\n8. When looking at Choices: prepare to go, we see that it is not clear from the context whether this action results in food. \n9. Hence we can rule out this option and move on to Choice D: sleep because this might be an option, but it is not explicitly stated in the context, and one can assume that sleeping only solves the problem temporarily.\n10. Finally, Choice E: food is not provided with an action. \"Preparing to go\" can be either food or an action to procure it. Therefore, we cannot use it to determine the answer.\n11.

This would require the person to engage in some sort of hunting, trapping, or stalking which is not only difficult considering hunter-gatherer lifestyles but also not guaranteed to lead to food discovery. \n6. Further, as hunting is a highly skilled occupation that requires equipment, this answer would be unlikely if we take into account the lack of technology available to the neolithic ancestor.\n7. Choice C: feel humiliation does not seem practically feasible. This action would most likely make this person feel bad and lead to less motivation rather than more likely to discover food, given the nature of the problem. \n8. Choice D: sleep is most likely not the solution. This would require either a large amount of food or a lengthy amount of time for someone with a lack of food to go without.\n9. Therefore choice E appears to be most plausibly the solution since it is a simple and straightforward step towards attaining sustenance.

Choices:  A : avenger's comic book B : avalanche's book C : bangor's book D: bangor's concert hall E: bangor' s concert hall\nRationales: The question: \"Where would you find the avengers? \" gives us some clues.\n1. Firstly it gives us the \"Avengers\" are a group of superhuman beings who operate together to fight crime. \n2. The clue indicates the \"Avengers' are beings of a superhuman order who operate together.\n3. Therefore from this clue we identify that the answer choice must be B. i.e Bangor's Comic Book as comic book refers to comics in Bangor. \n4. Comic books are a publication containing \ncartoon or fantasy stories, often illustrated, sometimes very violent. \n5. Therefore we find that the answer choice to the question would be B: Bangor's Comicon Book.\n6. In order to gain more information concerning the characters, it is useful to study the character's name as the first letter of their names usually indicates the first initial letter sound of their names, e.g: Ironman (iron, man)\n\nAnswer: Bangor's comic/Fantasy book\n\nInput: \"The __________ in Boston have gotten a big win over Miami. \" Choices :  A : home team B: miami C : miami C : mia D: miami D : boston\nRationales: Answer: The answer to this question is \"boston.\"", "answer": " 100"}

Also, we are seeking a solution, so choices B: hunt for and D: prepare to are not desirable since those would be proactive solutions that require initiative, \n6. and therefore would not apply to the situation where food may not be available immediately.\n7. As a result, the person may opt to sleep to pass the time and wait for food to be delivered, but this is unrealistic considering their lack of available food. \n8. Instead, choice C. Feel humiliated could be the best option to resolve the lack of food immediately, because the person can find food by offering another person something in exchange for it. \n9. Since it requires the least amount of actions and takes place mostly in a social environment, it seems plausible for the neolithic people to offer themselves in return for food.\n10. In this way, the person feels humiliated, but also acquires access to food. Choices B: hunt for, D: sleep and E: prepare to are not the most effective solutions for the problem, but choice C. feel humiliated could be suitable to resolve the problem of hunger.\nAnswer: C. feel humiliation\n\nInput: How does a plant react when it's touched? Choices:  a) It does not react b) It does not feel pain c) It turns to its side  d) a flower opens up e) it becomes excited\nRationales: Choices A: it does not react and E: it becomes excited are given as incorrect answers.\n1. According to the first choice, \"a plant does not react when touched.\"\n2. A plant does not react to touch, because it is not alive like animals. It does not feel pain like an animal.\n3. When touched, a plant will not turn to its side, but remains still.\n4. However, when a plant flower is touched, it may react by opening up in response to the touch.\n5. Therefore, from the given options, the choice that best fits the answer is B: \"A flower opens up\" which shows the most common reaction that the plant makes when it is touched.\n Answer: B: \"A flower is opened up\"\n\nInput: If you were a teacher, you would be responsible for the academic", "answer": " 54"}

Similarly, choice E: prepare to go, is a correct outcome, but it' not the solution to the given problem.\n8. The only choice that provides a solution to the problem is C: find food, which means feeling humiliated would be the most plausible reaction among the choices.\n9. Therefore the correct answer is B: feel humiliated.\nAnswer: B: feel humiliataed\n\nInput: There are many different species of bacteria, each with thier own unique _____. Choices:  A) type B) type C) form D) name E) name\nRationales: There are multiple species of bacteria. \nEach one has unique structures which define their species.\nThe bacterium is called a \"species\" in science because it has a unique type.\nA \"type\" is a specific part of the species.\nIt is the type that we can find in a specific individual. \nA group (like all the bacteria in the world) of the same type is called a \"form\".\nThose in the same form have a \"name\".\nTherefore Option E (Name) is the correct answer.\nAnswer: E.

{"text": "because it would only be a prayer or an expression of gratitude for which there is no action associated. \n5. The problem is to actually bring about food through some action. \n6. When we think about what actions the neolithic people may have performed to address their hunger, we see that hunting may have been one way of acquiring food.\n7. However, the person may have slept and prepared to go to hunt for food for two reasons: First, he may have been too tired to hunt effectively and may have decided to use tomorrow to hunt, when he will be well rested. \n8. Second, he may have wanted to preserve the source of his food, for example, a wild animal or fish, so he would be at a lesser risk of coming across predators or others who want that food for themselves.\n9. Choice D: feeling humiliated is not a solution to the problem of getting food as it is irrelevant to food acquisition.\n10. Finally, the two remaining choices are action-based.\n11. Therefore, we decide on choice B: hunt for nourishment. The person could potentially have hunted.\n12. So the answer is B: Hunt for food.\nAnswer: B: hunt for  food\n\nInput: Why did they go to the museum? To see what?

Choice B: hunting for food refers to the act of searching for animals and other edible entities. \n7. However, we can discern that this is not the best possible choice for the neolithic people because the options given does not represent all the choices available. \n8. This leaves us with the option C: feeling humiliated since this could have been a desperate act of procuring food. Feeling humiliated means feeling embarrassed or ashamed. As neolithic people likely did not value their feelings, they would have felt humiliated in order to obtain something to eat. Therefore, the answer has to be C: feel humiliate.\nAnswer: C feel humiliate\n\nInput: Money could be lost by a person who is what? Choices: A: irresponsible B: careless C: careful D: thoughtful E: thorough\nRationales: First, it is important to analyze the phrasing of the sentence. \"Money could be lost by someone who is\" indicates that we need to identify the person, and then figure out what would cause him to lose his money.\n1. Money could be lost is a suggestion that someone can lose their money, though this person is not specified.\n2. The phrasing of the sentence implies that the problem is the lack of responsibility or carelessness on the part of the person.\n3. Irresponsibility and carelessness are traits that describe someone who does not show concern for others or their actions.\n4. While thinking carefully and thoroughly can be helpful for tasks like completing a large project or completing difficult academic work, they do not necessarily relate to matters of money.\n5. Since the person mentioned in the title could lose his money, it is likely that he will do so because of poor judgment that results from irresponsibility or carelessness.\n6. Irresponsibility and/or carelessness are traps that will lead us to lose our money, this is because irresponsible and careless people are likely to take more risks since they do not care much about what happens to them.\n7.

Option E: preparing to go is not a solution to the problem, so option D: preparing to prepare is the optimal choice.\nThe person can use this preparation to find food in the future or deal with any other problems that might arise. \n9.

Choice C: feeling humiliated is a mental state that could cause the neolithic to stay hungry for a long period, as they are likely to feel too ashamed to leave their shelter in order to find food.\n6. Choice B: hunting for food refers to searching for prey or wild animals in order to provide sustenance.\n7. Choice D: sleep is out of the question. The neolithic hunt was conducted mostly when the sun went down.\n8. Therefore, Choice D alone is the one that is correct because it's the only option that describes the neolithic's actions.

Choices:  Lions of the diamond A: Bears from the wood B: Champions of baseball C: Heroes of our times D: Warriors of games E: Cats of baseball\nRationales: It is easy to understand the question. First, ask it how to make a poem title after the event of the baseball victory was done.\n1. The title should be a poem that celebrates the victory of baseball.\n2. The poem should have a title \"The Best Title For The Poem Written To Celebrate The Victory Of Baseball League\".\n3. To choose the answer, there must be six questions. To choose the answer to the sixth question, each question must have been answered.\n4. The sixth question tells us we must decide upon one choice, not all of them.\n5. Finally, we can see that the word \"best\" is in the question. And we have to choose one from five options, Lions of the diamonds, Bears from the wood, Champions of baseball, Heroes of our time, Warriors of games.\n6. The one thing about the title is to choose one. It is not possible to choose more than one, then there must be the word \"best\" in the title.\n7. The question must have only the first letter (no more, no less). This means that it is impossible to choose the whole question.", "answer": " 63"}

Choice B: hunt for some food implies that the person would search for and obtain food from their surroundings. Hunting refers to searching for and killing animals or gathering plants.\n7. Choice B is the most fitting option as it involves the procurement of nutrition by way of providing one's own food through gathering or hunting.\n8.

Choice D: sleeping is not a solution to this problem since the person wouldn't be able to get enough rest to stay awake and go hunting. \n6. Therefore, we can immediately eliminate D: sleep as an option.\n7. Choices B: hunt for Food and E: prepare to go would not help the person get food either. Hunting and gathering would require preparation which the person does not have, as he is hungry in the first place, and would not be able to go due to lack of energy.\n8. This leaves us with alternatives A: thank god and C: feel humiliate. Out of the two, we can argue that feeling humiliated would not help the hungry person; this would only increase his feeling of hunger.\n9. This is because feelings of discomfort, humiliation, and depression, are typically associated with the desire to find food. This would provide an additional incentive to the person to acquire food. Feeling bad would also be in conflict with feeling thankful to god, making the person less likely to thank him for something he would appreciate.\n10. Furthermore, feeling humiliation would also increase the feeling of hunger due to the feeling of shame, thus causing the desire to find food to double.\n11. The only remaining option is A: thank god. This is why we select this choice because it conveys the right feelings and attitude to get food.\n12. Therefore, the correct choice is A: thank god because being grateful would be the most effective way to attract god's blessings for getting food.\nAnswer: A. thank god\nInput: The man is a good leader for our team.

Choices:  A : He was very happy to win\nB: It was a boring match\nC:The other winners just left early\nD: He was very disappointed in his team\nE: He knew he was going to win the match\nRationales: We don't know who the winner of the game was, but we can use inductive reasoning to infer his/her state of mind.\n1. In order to accurately use inductive reasoning here, we would need to know the winner's emotions or state of mind before and after the final outcome of the sporting match.\n2. Based on the previous information in the question, the only emotional states that fit this pattern are happiness and disappointment, as it is unlikely for a winner to leave the match with a state of boredom or surprise.\n3. Therefore, the following sequence of emotions can be inferred from the given facts: \"win \u2192 happy \u2192 leave\".\n4. We know that the winner should have left the match with some level of happiness (either extreme or mild).\n5. Hence, the winner of the match must have been an extremely happy individual to be able to leave the match, as the other choices (b, c, and e) do not accurately describe the possible mood of the winner. \n6. Similarly, we know that the winner cannot have left the match \"disappointed in his/her team\" since after the match, he/she must have been happy because they won, which does not suggest a state of dissatisfaction.\n7.

C could be desirable, but it was previously proven that there will be religious conflicts as the two groups cannot live harmoniously. \n5. D cannot be the case as the area cannot be considered a peaceful community because the conflict between the two groups of people will still be there. \n5.

Similarly, Choice D: sleeping does not explicitly involve obtaining food, it's an outcome of being hungry. \n8.

Choices: \tA: don't go B: we can't talk anymore C: I was busy D: don't bother me E: you and I don't have anything to talk about\nRationales:\t1. The question talks about a person who decided not to speak to the one giving the question.\n2. The asker of the question is curious as to why the other person didn't want to talk to them.\n3. As such, there's nothing specific to say about what happened, so what we will be doing is figuring out why the person chose not to talk to the one who asked the question.\n4. The options can relate to the reason the person gave in either being rude or not wanting to bother the other person.\n5. If the other person was not rude, then \"don't go\", \"we can't talk anymore\", and \"don't bother me\" would make more sense because the person could be busy.\n6. \"I was busy\" does not make much sense because we would understand that the person is busy if we hear why they don't want to talk or what they were doing.\n7.

In this context, there is no need for a humiliation or emotional instability, because the question states they are just \"hungry\".\n7. Choice D: sleep would be a logical option if the person was too tired to go out and find food. However, this is not the case here, since the person is only \"hungry\". The word \"starving\" might imply that the person was extremely hungry, but that is not the case either, since \"hungry\" implies some amount of hunger and not starvation.\n8. Therefore, we can narrow down our options to choosing from Choices B: hunts for food or E: prepares to go, since these two options might lead to the acquisition of food.\n9. Since we have eliminated Choice C, we need to determine which of the two options leads to the procurement or acquisition of food. This can be done by determining whether both options have something to do with finding food.\n10. Choice B: hunts for Food is an action performed to obtain food. It involves actively seeking food in order to find food.\n11.

This indicates that the person is performing/learning well rather than casually or randomly as \"fine\", \"all right\", \"terrible\" and \"perfect\" would suggest.\n2. The expression \"at math class\" further reinforces this meaning, as it specifies which class or subject the person is referring to. \n3.

Therefore, this item is necessary for rides, regardless of whether or not the driver suspects that the tire pressure is low.\nSecond, the question indicates that this item is \"necessary for rides,\" so we can rule out items that do not pertain to transportation (e.g. a hat, gloves, or sunglasses).\nLastly, the \"tire pressure\" in the question is contextual to the item we need to be sure to keep in the car.\nBased on the above considerations, the correct answer is L - Tire gauge.\n\nInput: The word \"megalops\" is an archaic word for a type of what?

Choices: \nA: A person who practices law can be a lawyer, but a lawyer can't practice law.\nB: A lawyer may or may not practice law, but a person who practices law must be a lawyer.\nC: A person who practices land will always be a lawyer, but that's not the case for a lawyer.\nD: A lawyer is unable to practice law, whereas a person who practices law can do that.\nRationales:\n1. In order to understand the question, we first need to take into account a few common associations and interpret \"practice law\" accordingly.\n2. Typically, law is something that is practiced by lawyers.\n3. However, lawyers may not always deal with legal issues, but they are always practicing to perform specific tasks related to law.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that a person who practices law is a lawyer who has the skills, knowledge, and experience to deal with legal matters.\n5. In addition, lawyers and law clerks may also have duties that involve the legal aspects of a case or dispute.\n6. In our terms, a person who practices law implies a person who is both a lawyer and a law clerk.\n7. To verify this, let's look at the choices:\n8. Choice A: \"Person who practices law can be lawyer, but a lawyer cannot practice law.\"\n9. This choice is grammatically correct, however, its meaning does not align with the way we have interpreted the term \"practice law\".\n10. In other words, a person who practices \"law can be a", "answer": " 35"}

Similarly, choice B: hunt is not the best course of action because it indicates another person will have to hunt for food to satisfy the person's hunger.\n6. Choice D: sleep could potentially allow the person to survive until more food becomes available. However, their survival would be on the assumption that someone else has successfully provided for their needs.\n7. Choice E: prepare to go implies that the person needs to travel to find food.  While this would work, it lacks efficiency in comparison with other solutions.\n8. Additionally, the person could be unable to satisfy their hunger even after finding food. This leads us to choose C: feel humiliation. \n9. Firstly, this choice involves humiliation, which is a low-level emotion, so it would not be a solution to one's hunger. \n10. Secondly, it's a non-action, therefore it can't fix the problem. \n11. Thirdly, it's not logical to feel humiliation before feeling hunger. \n9. Therefore, the answer must be B: Hunt.\nAnswer: B: hunt\n\nInput: Who is smarter, you or Billy? Choices:  Your: A: Billy B: yourself C: yourself D: Bill E: Bill\nRationales:\n1.

Choices:  A : kitchen, ran in  B : bathroom, screamed  C : laundry, stopped to smell the flowers  D : bedroom, got ready for sleeping  E : guestroom, started looking \nRationales:\n\n1. The question is about someone who entered a room in his house and did something.\n2. The second blank indicates an action, such as running or getting ready for sleeping.\n3. The given choices do not provide enough information. \n4. Consider the options carefully to find an action that fits. One thing we know for sure is that the person who entered the room did not run or scream, making these choices eliminate. \n5. Only 3 of the choices could have been done in a bedroom: stopped to smell the flower, screamed, or getting ready for sleep. We can quickly eliminate the first one because the person entered the room, not stopped to smell the room. We can eliminate the second one since there is no word in the question to indicate that there was anything scary in the room after the person entered. \n6. Therefore, it must have been a \"nice\" type of room.\n7. This leaves us with 2 options: either a relaxing bedroom or a party-ready guestroom. \n8. Since a scream in the bedroom would cause confusion to its occupants and ruin their sleep, it is likely that the person who entered said room will not do anything that might affect the occupants while they are asleep.\n9. Hence, the answer has to be E: guestroom, started looking.\nAnswer: E : started looking in the guestroom \n\nInput: In the 21st", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "because it does not contain any actions or ideas to achieve the desired outcome.\n5. Choice C: feeling humiliated would not be an appropriate course of action as food is generally not obtained through these feelings.\n6. Similarly, Choices B and D: hunt for food and prepare to go respectively cannot be considered solutions for finding food, as they lack the ability to sustain the person and require further action.\n7. Therefore the only choice possible that could conceivably lead to finding food is Option A: hunt for food.\n8. Given that there is no explicit need to hunt down an animal or look for berries, the question is implying that food is scarce and may not be readily available in the environment.\n9. Hence, the solution to the problem of the neolithic man's hunger would be Choice A: hunt for Food.\nAnswer: A : hunt for food\n\nInput: A farmer wants the most fruit per tree.  He decides to make sure the trees get what? Choices: A: enough sunlight B:  good fertilizer C:  enough water D: good drainage E: plenty of light\nRationales: Considering that \"the most fruit per tree\" indicates that the farmer wants the trees to produce as much fruit as possible, we should choose the option that best fits a scenario where the trees produce as much fruit as they can. Out of all the options, only option A \"good fertilizer\" can be considered the cause of the trees' fruit production increase, as it is the only thing the farmer is giving the trees that can lead to an increase in harvest.\nAnswer: A Good Fertilizer\n\nInput: Which of these is a positive aspect of a person who is a workaholic?

So, out of all the given choice, we try to find out the positive aspect of this person. The answer is D, Workaholics have plenty of energy because the question talks about a", "answer": " 9"}

Choices:  a) buy a cheaper car b) buy a car with a lower insurance rate c) avoid buying a car at all d) save money by buying an expensive car\nRationales:1. The question is about good ways to save money.\n2. The most direct ways to save money are to buy cheaper products and reduce spending on services or goods that don't necessary help you achieve your goals.\n3. We can eliminate choices A (cheaper car), D (expensive car) straight away since this isn't about saving money but achieving other goals.\n4. The following four choices provide a good amount of information on how to economize.\n5. Choice (B) buy a car with lower insurance rate is not about money, it's about insurance which is a service that people pay for rather than purchase (except for a new car that doesn't yet have low insurance).\n6. Choices A, B, C, D mention cars. Cars don't make money they consume it. Hence, they're not related to saving money, and we rule them out.\n7. Car insurance is about money, it'll save you money by lowering your coverage and thus what you pay for it. That's how insurance works. So, as insurance can save you money the same can be said with buying a car with a lower rate of insurance. It'll save you money, but it's not about saving money.\n8. Choices A (bargain hunting) and D (buy expensive car) indicate that they're about what you get out rather than about saving.\n9. Therefore of the remaining three choices, we choose choice B which relates to both saving money and having it available, so it is the best way to save.\n10.", "answer": " 41"}

Choice D: sleep, is another emotional response to being hungry, and can certainly occur in addition to, or in tandem with, acquring food to alleviate hunger.\n9. The only remaining option is Choice E: \"prepare to go\" does not specify an act of acquiring food but it describes the intention to do so.

Choice D: sleep makes sense, as sleeping may be a solution after the body is satiated. \n6. However, sleep would not solve the hunger itself. Choice E: prepare to go is even less related to solving the hunger, because the preparation would likely be related to food and/or shelter from extreme weather, not specifically linked to food.\n7.

A butcher may also have been working in the kitchen for a long time. However, the chef will likely have a better sense of flavor and food production than a butcher.\n2. The chef has more time to cultivate the skills of taste, presentation, and quality control when compared to the other positions of the kitchen.\n3.

By contrast, choice B: distressed infers a state of high stress, worry, or concern which fits better with the situation at hand of a person expressing emotions after a job loss.\n    5.

E: \"I'm sorry.\"\nRationales: This is a question of interpersonal communication where we have to infer the actual meaning of the brother's message.\n\n1. Option A says \"I love you\". This is too plain to be the actual meaning of the message. \n\n2. B : \"You're OK\" - This seems to be the actual message of the brother. His brother said so more than words. This tells us clearly that the brother is feeling positive about him, and is trying to tell the brother to be relaxed or confident.\n\n3. Option C says \"I like you\". This suggests that if an individual likes someone, he or she will treat the others. For example, he or she will do favors. This is also plausible. \n\n4.

Similarly, Choice B: hunt for some food is not a good solution since there is no food or nourishment in the area the hunt may take them to.\n\n6. Choice D: sleep seems like a reasonable action to take since it's related to rest, which is a necessity that humans have as well as other animals.\n7. While we can say that food is also necessary to all animals, sleep is an aspect of human living that is not required.\n8. This is confirmed when looking at the definition of \"neolithic\" which means \"from the time when people began to use hardened stone rather than wood or bone tools\".\n9. In this context, the neolithic people were humans who lived in ancient times.\n10. Therefore, since food and sleep are human-related aspects, sleep is the most likely solution that a neolithic person can take.\n11.

Less C. about the same E. Not enough\nRationales:\n1. The context of the question suggests that Cathy is a person who is eating and touring the Great Wall at the same time.\n2. Given the context, we know that food is necessary to the person.\n3. Since Cathy is on the Great Wall, it could be assumed that she is physically active while she is touring, which could lead to a bigger expenditure of energy and thus the need for a greater amount of food.\n4. According to the choices given, the answer will be about  more food, since less food implies less and about the same could be either  about more or about less food.\n5. Although less food could be true, the answer should be about the same, given the context of the question, while we could rule out the other two options.\n6.

Choices: A: respectful B: encouraging C D E F\nRationales: The question asks for a quality that best describes the person who should try to encourage others.\nA: respectful - This is an important quality, but it doesn\u2019t directly describe an action, so it can\u2019t be an action that encourages others - the person who tries to encourage others should choose an appropriate quality.\nB: encouraging - This choice implies a positive encouragement, but it doesn'e include an action that other can actually choose, so another choice can be selected.\nC: D, E and F are all negative, which is in contradiction with what is needed.\nThe answer can be deduced by looking at what is not an option. A respectful person is not encouraging, and respect doesn't directly describe an action.\nTherefore, a respectful person is more important in this context than those who encourage, and the action that encourages others should be encouraging.\nThe action that encourages others is encouraging, and therefore the choice would be B: encouraging.\n\nAnswer: B: encouraging\n\nInput: A man is being tried for murder.

From the limited information given, we can infer that the carpenter intended to fix something that had already caused damage to the floor in the building they were working on.\n3.

The question asks us to choose the solution that a neolithic person would use to solve the problem.\n7. Therefore we consider what the person can do to acquire food, namely what solutions are they likely to use.\n8. Choices E: go and C: sleep are not feasible since we don't have an indication of why the person is hungry. It could be that the person has been working hard and is simply exhausted. In this case, going or sleeping would only exacerbate their problem as they need food not rest.\n9. Choice B: feels humiliated is an abstract concept. It implies the person feels ashamed due to being a failure or mistake, it does not relate to gathering food resources. \n10. Therefore, remaining the only option, which is feasible, is answer D: Prepare to go.\n11. This can be interpreted as the person gathering the necessary resources to venture on a path that will allow them to search for food.\n12.

The wording of the question implies that He left his home to go on a vacation or trip. We need to determine what he would be doing while traveling and when he would arrive at his destination. \n4. Answer E represents \"waiting\"; this would be a good indication that he would be at his destination.  Choice B \"departing\" could also mean that the person is traveling, however it could also mean that he is leaving in preparation for a trip. It does not specify whether he is traveling, so we cannot use it as a definitive answer.\n3. Choice D, \"enjoying himself\" indicates that he has actually arrived and is happily enjoying himself. \n2.

While you may think she is wrong to drink beer, you don't think she is righteus. This indicates that you think she must do something wrong. But while drinking beer might be wrong, the options also describe sinful or irreligious behaviors. Mary's father has not mentioned these behaviors, so they are not relevant to his approval or disapproval of her. Therefore, the only behavior Mary's father has specified is drinking beer.\n1. The first step after understanding the context is to see what is the specific behavior that Mary's father has given about her- that she drinks beer. \n2.

Choice D: sleep also would not help the person because they would wake up more hungry due to having gone without food for an extended period.\n7. Choice E: prepare to go might be a possible solution, even though they would just continue wandering with the same result. However, we are confident that preparing to go would be more effective because that gives a clear direction to the person and allows them to potentially achieve their goal.\n8. The answer is therefore: E: prepare to go.\nAnswer: E prepare to go\n\nInput: What did the ancient Romans usually drink?  Choices:  A. hot chocolate B. coffee C. tea D. beer E. wine\nRationales: From the choice: \"hot chocolate\" We can conclude that the ancient Romans had the drink on very cold and snowy days.\nChoice \"tea\" will be eliminated because it's a green tea which is the drink mostly prefered by today's people (the contemporary era), though we can say that the ancient Roman's liked it to due to the hotter, and drier climate of ancient italy.\nChoice \"Coffee\" from the text description of the options, we can conclude it was a drink that was made using the dried grains of coffee beans, or from the name: coffee, that was known throughout the whole world from the 15th century.\nChoice \"D: Beer\" From the ancient roman's diet, the food of the poor people was considered the beer because it was made with grains, which is also a kind of beer.\nChoice \"E: Wine\" was also a drink that was made by the wealthy ancient Roman's because wine was known to be used in almost every dinner and was drunk by rich people and the people who worked for them.", "answer": " 319"}

In this case, Choices B, C, D, and E don't make sense either because: \n6. Choices B and D are referring to hunt-related actions. However, in the context of the neolithic period, hunting was not the main activity for food procurement.\n7. Hunting has become the main way to collect food for our society due to scientific progress and new technological advancements.\n8. Therefore, an activity like hunting could only be seen as a type of food supply in the modern world but not in the era of the neolithics.\n9. Similarly, Choices C and E refer to different forms of sleep which are also ineffective to the present state problem.  \n10. The only remaining choice is C: feel humiliation. There is no definitive statement that this would solve the problem, but at this point of the answer, it is the most fitting.\n11. However, we can take this a step further and consider the actions that are followed after feeling humiliated.\n12. Choice D: prepare to go is the only suitable next step to solve the problem because the person should prepare to explore and discover more to find food.\n13. Therefore, the option that best suits the story problem is D: prepare to go.\nAnswer: D.

This sets the context of the elevator ride, where the rider is the last person and the sole occupant, meaning they would have been alone in the elevator with few people. \n3.

{"text": "in this context because there is no reason to believe the hunger would be resolved solely by prayer.\n5. Choice C: feeling humiliated cannot lead to the procuremnet of food because feeling ashamed would result in the person giving up and refraining from looking for food.\n6. Moreover, it is not clear what would result from feeling humiliated, and the word \"hunt\" does not appear among the given options. \n7. Although option B: hunt for the food might work, we need to remember that this person is neolithic, and would not have the relevant tools or technology to be able to perform the hunt properly and therefore catch any food successfully.\n8. Therefore, we should eliminate option B.\n9. This leaves us with option D: sleep.\n10. Sleeping would be suitable for this person because they would most likely be tired from searching for food, and in order to be able to continue, they would need to rest.\n11. In addition, the word \"prepare\" and the phrase \"prepare to go\" do not refer to sleep properly and are not connected with the given context.\n12. On the other hand, the word \"sleep\" is mentioned and its relevance to the situation would be to rest in order to continue searching for food. \n13. Furthermore, since we are not given any indication about what the person would be in, the term sleep and its use are the most appropriate words as the person would not be going anywhere.\n14.

Choice D: sleeping is not a direct solution to the problem because the person may need to get food later on.\n\n6. Choice E: prepare to go refers to a general action, but we cannot tell what the person would prepare in this case. There have been no other details provided that would clarify this. This choice may also indicate that preparation time would be a problem since the person may already be hungry. Hence, we can exclude this option.\n\n7. Choice C: feel humiliation is another general term that doesn't indicate any action or solution. \n\n8. We can rule out B: hunt for mood as it conveys action, yet we cannot know if the person is capable of finding food in this way.\n9. The only remaining option is choice B: hunt for fish, which is a direct action that shows the person's intention to go find food.\n10. This action should also satisfy their physical need, and it indicates that they wouldn't experience the problem of hunger for a short period of time. \n11.

Choice C: feel humiliate is a subjective and selfish reaction to being hungry and unsuccessful in obtaining food. \n6. This does not actually solve the problem or bring the person any closer to getting food.\n7. Choice E: prepare to go refers to leaving one's home to find food, but this action is not guaranteed to lead to finding something to eat.\n8. Since the question is about how the person solves the problem rather than their feelings about it, what's actually needed is an action that leads directly to obtaining food.\n9. Therefore we need to exclude other options and focus on Choices B and D. \n10. Choice B: hunt means looking for game or wild animals to hunt and is more likely to provide the person with food.\n11. Choice D: sleep is an action which does not directly provide food. \n12. Sleeping can help relieve stress but it does not guarantee food in this situation, while Choice B: hunting does directly ensure one person has food since they kill the animal.\n13. Therefore the most obvious action to take is to hunt an animal and get food, this solves the problem of being hungry directly and would be the most plausible answer.\n14.

Choice C: feeling humiliated is not an action, it is an emotion, and it is not a likely response that would lead to the solution of the problem.\n6. Similarly, Choice D: sleeping could be a potential solution, and many people end up eating food after they wake up from sleeping. \n7. The question is asking for a specific solution, and since sleeping is not a guaranteed method for acquiring food, it is not an appropriate choice.\n8. The remaining choices A: hunt for food B: prepare to go are both action-oriented and likely to be effective.\n9. Therefore the correct answer is B: prepare to go because \"prepare to go\" could entail hunting for food, cooking, or preparing different types of food.\n10. Prepare to go is a more flexible option that can be used as a means to various food acquisition processes.\n11. If the person is unable to find anything suitable to eat right away, they could also use the time to plan for future food needs, such as setting traps for fish or planting fruit trees.\n12.

Therefore all that is left are choices B (hunt for food), C ( feel humiliated), E (provisionally prepare to go).\n7. It could be argued that feeling humiliated could be a reasonable response if one's ego doesn't allow them to admit defeat and their efforts were fruitless.\n8. However feeling humiliated may also be seen as a negative reaction to the hungry situation, perhaps they should have felt a motivation to procure food.\n9. Choice E doesn't work either, as provisionally preparing to go means a temporary exit from the situation due to the impending scarcity of resources, which is the exact reason they are hungry and trying to solve the problem.\n10.

Choice D: sleep seems counterintuitive and would only create a hunger that would worsen the situation.\n8. Therefore, the only viable solution, out of the choices given, is Option E: prepare to go. This choice matches how to get food according to the situation as described in the question. The person's only option is to prepare to go, which is to hunt for food.

Put effort into it.\nB. Keep writing it down.\nC. Keep repeating it in your head.\nD. Keep trying until you get it.\nE. Look around for what's familiar to you.\nRationales:\n1. The phrase \"Put effort into it\" implies that it's crucial to keep working at it until you remember.\n2. \"Keeping writing it down\", as opposed to putting effort into it, emphasizes the importance of preparation in remembering things.\n3. Keep it on the tip of your tongue: keep repeating something over and over to yourself as you go about your activities.\n4. Keep trying to remember: this option echoes put effort into it.  They are both emphasizing the need to keep trying.\n5. Look around for what is familiar and comfortable: this means you keep a lookout for anything familiar to improve your remembrance: keep a lookout for what you will be able to recognize and relate to.\n6. The two options, keeping writing it down and keeping trying to remember, could go together in that one should keep repeating it over and over again.\n7. In this regard, one should have some form of methodology: use a mnemonic device or a technique, and keep repeating what you are trying to remember.\n8.

Choices B & C: imply a search for food and an attempt to satisfy the hunger in a practical way.\n7. \"Prepare to go\" (Choice E) is not a valid option for this problem. \"Go\" here refers to the location and does not directly relate to food. \n8. Only Choices B & C relate to the need for finding food to alleviate hunger, therefore either option is valid.\n9. However, an action that is more likely to be carried out in response to hunger is that the neolthic person would choose to do \"hunt for food\", based on the following reasons:\n10. Choice B: Hunt for food suggests searching for food in a proactive way, as opposed to Choice C: Feel humiliated, which is an apathetic approach implying that the person would feel they don't deserve food or be content with whatever they had. It could be inferred that feeling humiliated would impede someone from seeking food. \n11. Choice B also appears to more closely fit the time period as it relates to hunting, an activity typically associated with neolithic people.\n12. Therefore, an accurate answer choice for this question would be Choice B: HUNT FOR FOOD.\nAnswer: B: HUNT FOR A FOOD\n\nInput: The main character of the story is being forced to do something that doesn't sit well with his heart.

Forming lightning bolts\n5. Making the clouds darker\nRationales: The question is asking what a thunderstorm would be doing to a cloud. To answer this question we need to know what a thunderstrom is and how it works. \nA thunderstorm is a type of storm that occurs when hot, moist air rises rapidly, creating and updraft, and resulting in a big pocket of cool, moist air known as a cold pool. When these cold pools of air collide with the upward air they create thunder which is accompanied by lightning bolts. \n\nThere are a number of things that can be done to a cloud with a thunderstorm such as:\n\n1. The thunderstorm itself\n2. If the thunderstorm is very violent it can shake the cloud, knocking tiny flakes of ice from it.\n\n3. The rain cloud\n\n4. With a thunderstorm, clouds are more likely to create lightning.\n\nThe word \"it\" implies that it was referring to the cloud. \n\nTherefore, based on the question, all the options except 1 are likely to be happening. \nThe sentence that would best fit into the blank would be", "answer": " 50"}

It is first necessary to identify the keywords from the problem statement.\n2. Identifying the keywords, we see that we have a 'first semester' problem statement. We also know that the keywords in this instance are: 'involved, confused, enthusiastic, happy, uninterested, anxious.'\n3. Based on the problem statement of the first semester, we can eliminate options that do not involve being in the first semester and also options that do not match the keywords given.\n4. Since the problem is a first semester, option b: 'confused' does not make sense because first semester students should not be feeling confused.\n5. Option d: 'uninterested' does not make sense either, as students in first semester should be excited about their schooling.\n6. Option e: 'anxious' does not make sense as being anxious does not involve first semesters.\n7.

Choices: A: moving up B: moving down C: stable D: changing E: all these choices are correct\nRationales:1. The question asks about the prices of stocks when they are a great time to buy or sell, implying that they will generally increase, but potentially drop as well.\n2. A price is constant (stable/firm/fixed/constant/stable) when it does not change regardless of how it is affected by external factors, such as supply and demand. \n3. In the context of stocks, it would generally be considered a great time to buy when the prices move up, as this means prices are high and thus profits can be made by buying and selling at the higher prices.\n4. Prices will move up and down depending on supply and demand, and the higher the stock prices, the more profits can be made.\n5. Conversely, it would generally be a bad time to buy stocks when the prices move down, as this means that prices are low, indicating possible losses due to selling at these prices.\n6. Hence, among the given choices D: \"Change\" does not hold true in the context of buying and selling stocks, this occurs due to supply and demand factors, which is not the same as price changes for other products.\n7.

Choices:  a) at the beginning of a raining season B) the end of mid-aun C) the start of mid-autumn D) the end of the raining season E) the start of mid autumn\nRationales: The given options consist of the following:\n1. The phrase at the beginning of a rain season implies that frogs would be more active and would be easier to catch during this time.\n2. A raining season refers to the period when it rains consistently, typically from June to September in many parts of the world.\n3. However, frogs are known to become extremely active during this time, increasing their chances of getting caught.\n4. The phrase the end of mid-august also refers to the beginning of autumn, which is another reason why frogs become more active during this time of year, since there is a drop in temperature and an increase in frog activity.\n5.

Choices:  I: a space suit  II: a nice robe III: a bathing suit IV: a tunic  V:  jewels\nRationales: The question refers to going to mars and we should consider what one would like to wear as it would contribute to the trip.\n\n1. The options presented are: a space suit, a nice robe, a bathing suit, a tunic and jewels.\n\n2. A space suit is protective wear, usually with built-in air supply and is essential when travelling to Mars.\n\n3. A nice robe would be better in colder climates, but not always practical.\n\n4. A bathing suit is practical when visiting beaches or resorts, but not relevant to the trip and more suited to sunny or warm climates.\n\n5. A tunic would be more appropriate in the same situations as a bathing suit.\n\n6. A jewel is not a very practical item to wear when travelling or on a trip.\n\n7.

Gifts should be something special and different from what they already have. Some 8-year olds love technology, and gaming gadgets are a great idea.  What not to get would be a doll which seems too childish. Choices:  A. doll B. video game (or game) C. laptop D. phone E. camera\nRationales:    1. The question is about the best gift for an 18-year-old and we must decide on the most suitable answer based on the question given. \n2. Since the person is at the age of 8, we must consider which gifts are suitable for an 8 year old and which ones are not.\n3. When considering the gift that the 8 year old might want or like, the question includes several options that fall within the category of suitable gifts, which are a doll, a video game, a phone, and a laptop.\n4. A specific doll is not specifically mentioned in the question, however, it can be inferred that a doll is too childish for an 18 year old and not something that suits the age range.\n5. When considering the gift to avoid, we also deduce that video game, phone, and laptop are suitable for the person to have.\n6.

A helicopter landed nearby,  Which individual would be of least help to a fellow survivor? Choices: \tA: man B: boy C: woman D: helicopter pilot\nRationales:  1. The question presents a scenario where a man, woman, and boy are involved in a boating accidents.\n2. A helicopter lands nearby and is capable of providing assistance to the survivors.\n3. This situation suggests the presence of three available individuals and one pilot who, depending on the particular scenario, could potentially benefit the survivor.\n4. The pilot is specifically identified as the person who would be of least help. \n5. While a helicopter could indeed prove useful in finding and saving a fellow survivor, it seems most likely that the pilot would not know what to do in case of a rescue operation.\n6. Furthermore, the helicopter could be a resource for the other survivors. They could use it as a means of transportation to a safe place, the water, objects from the boat, and so on.\n7. Hence we conclude that the least helpful person, out of all the options given, is the helicopter pilot.

Choices:  the kind that is done underground at night  the kind that is built all year round  the kind who can work alone or with others  the kind who can use various tools  the kind who do a variety of jobs at various times of the day\nRationales: First, look at the answer choices.\n\n6. If you look at the question, it states that the carpenters had decided upon a specific plan, which is to build the cabin on a different side so that it could be properly exposed to sunshine during the day.\n7. This plan would result in a different kind of work compared to the traditional approach to building a cabin, which would involve working at night.\n8. Next, we look at the answer choices and narrow down the options that are likely related to the question.\n9. Choices one and two are definitely not related because they are about work that is done underground or throughout the year.\n10. Choices three and four only refer to the way that the work is done, whether alone or with others, which they could do both day and night.\n11.

B: a doctor visit makes less sense because if the doctor was not in his office, then he or she was not available to patients or patients would not be expected to make a doctor's visit to the doctor who was not around in the office at the time.\n3. C: a business call refers to when a doctor makes a call related to his or her practice. For example, the doctor may make a call to get a refill because he or she ran out or call to book a new appointment slot. However, this option makes no sense, as the doctor would be more concerned about being available", "answer": " 186"}
{"text": "to a hunger problem and would not be effective in getting food.\n5. Choice C: feeling humiliated does not logically lead to food. Humiliation can cause psychological distress, but it does not automatically lead to a solution for a physical problem.\n6. Choices B and D contain actions. So, let's see if they would naturally lead to food if our character wasn't already provided with any.\n7. If we hypothetically let the character sleep for long enough, food would be waiting for them in the morning. However, that is not an appropriate answer because a person experiencing hunger does not have the luxury to wait for food to appear. This is only a short-term solution, and it does not provide an effective long-term response that is required to solve the problem of hunger.\n8. Choice B: hunt for would is the most logical. \n9. A person hunted for food to survive during this time period. \n10. After identifying the correct answer, it is easy to conclude that the correct answer is D: Hunt.\nAnswer: D : Hunt.\n\nInput: When two forces work together, what happens? Choices: 1. A: The first is bigger 2. B: They cancel 3. C: They change direction 4. D: They equal out 5. E: They add up\nRationales: After careful analysis of the question, we find that the first choice that is not likely is (1) \u2013 The first is bigger. \n\n1. \n\nIn this question, choices A and B will not work because our body is on Earth, not in space. \n\n2. \n\nOption D is likely because our body is on the Earth. There isn\u2019t necessarily a gravitational pull from every planet. Gravity is what holds our body together; it would not be affected by any other planet that had a gravitational pull. When two forces work together to create a reaction, it would be normal for them to cancel out or simply not exist if only one force was present.\n\nHowever, there is no choice C either and it doesn\u2019t have any relation with the given information. It\u2019s a wrong answer.\n\nTherefore, option E is the best response.\n\nInput: There are five things that can cause constellations to be visible in", "answer": " 32"}

Choice C: feeling humiliated is likely not to be relevant to this scenario, as it would be an emotion associated with a very different problem.\n6. Choice D: sleeping does not necessarily mean finding food, and, as it is unlikely the person was physically unable to leave their home or camp to find food while they were sleeping, this is also unlikely to be the solution to the problem.\n7. There are two options that would seem to lead to finding food: \"hunt for food\" and \"prepare to go.\" \n8. Choice B: hunt for something to eat is an obvious solution, as a person needs to find food in order to end their hunger, and is plausible given the nature of neolithic living.\n9. As for choice E: prepare to go, this would not directly lead to finding food as the hungry person does not yet know where to find food. \n10. It appears that choice B is the answer, as it is an action that would satisfy the need for food as a result of the problem given.\nAnswer: B: hunt for a meal\n\nInput: If an object is moving faster than another that object has what type of motion? Choices: 1A: constant 2B: variable 3C: irregular 4D: cyclical E: none of the above\nRationales:\n1. The question is about objects moving faster than each other. \n2. The answer should describe a type of motion that an object can have when it is faster than another.\n3. The choices given are constant, variable, irregular, cyclical and none of the above.\n4. Constant, variable and irregular are types of motion that a simple object could have. \n5. However, cyclical is not a type of motion.\n6. Therefore the answer is not cyclical or any of the remaining choices.\n7. This means the answer is variable, which simply means an object can move faster than another based on a range of different speeds.\n8. Therefore, choice 2 is correct. \nAnswer: 2: variable\n\nInput: Which of the following is NOT a good way to show you are thinking about your decisions? Choices:", "answer": " 20"}

Choice C: feel humiliation can be considered a solution or the cause of the solution, in this case, it is considered a cause. It is associated with food as humiliation would incite action, which can be interpreted to be either finding food or preparing to go.\n6. However, preparing to go would not necessarily lead to the solution, it is merely indirect. Choices B and C do not directly lead to having sustenance. Choices A and E do not lead to receiving food at all. \n7. Choice D: sleep may lead to awakening the next day with a solution or not, making it indirect at best and most likely unnecessary. \n8.

{"text": ". This is because thanking god is an act of worship that involves praying and showing gratitude to religious forces. \n5. This is not an action that could directly lead to acquiring food for oneself.\n6. Choice B: hunting for food is an option that the neolithics may have relied on. Hunt for food refers to finding food sources, such as hunting animals or gathering plants while exploring the environment. It is a process that can take time and effort, but it can potentially lead to finding food sources. \n7. However, the question implies that the neolithical person had to find some sort of immediate solution to the hunger problem. Therefore, the action of hunt for food is impractical in this context. \n8. Additionally, Choice C and D: feeling humiliated and sleeping, are not direct actions suitable for solving this type of problem.\n9. This can be confirmed by interpreting the question as \"hungry>food>hunting>eating> solution\". \n10. This means a hunter that is \"hungry\" to go hunt for food in turn \"hunting\" the food will eventually end up \"eating\" the found food for a \"solution\" that would satisfy their hunger. \n11. Therefore, between the answers (A: thank god, B: hunt for the food, C: feel humiliation, D: sleep, E: prepare to go), we can determine the option that conveys the most direct action fitting for solving the hunger problem: Choice B: hunt for a food.\nAnswer: B: hunt for\n\nInput: You get this message when downloading an iOS device.

Both options involve actions that would enable the person to obtain food.\n8. However since A: prepare to go is a verbal expression which would not result in food.\n9. A: Hunt for would lead to food and it's the closest answer.\n10. So the best answer is B: hunt for in line with the meaning of the word that is hunt for food.\n11.

Choices:  An emotional reaction to starving himself of the beloved delicacy. Choices:  A) anger, B) sadness, C) relief, D) depression, E) hunger, F) obesity.\n\nRationales: Out of the above given choices, only 'B' and 'D' makes any sense. There's a clear pattern that all other choices are emotional reactions that are not directly related to the cause and result of the question. Also, 'Death' seems to be too extreme a possible reaction. Although 'Depression' is associated with 'death', neither word would seem to go with 'Dept of Health' in the beginning of the question. \n\nRationales:'C' would mean that the person is completely out of his mind with an extreme depression and would probably result in a breakdown while 'F' would mean that there was no connection to the cause and result, and hence would not make any sense.\n\nAnswer: Option B, D\n\nInput: He has to make a quick decision about a house to buy.

This leaves Choices C: feel humiliation and E: prepare to go, as they can both be considered actionable solutions to the problem of procuring food. \n7. However, feeling humiliation doesn't solve the actual problem, it's just a state of being, and doesn't ensure any particular action is taken.

{"text": "to eating hunger as it is not a finite resource like food.\n5. Choice C: feel humiliation is also unlikely to help solve the problem, as it is likely to cause the person to act in a way that would not lead to eating. Choice C can also be eliminated by looking at the other option words. \n6. The options remaining are A: Hunt for food, B: Sleep, and C: Prepare to go. Choice B: Sleep is not a good option to hunt for food even though it can help someone rest. \n7. So, we will examine choice words closely to examine the meaning that makes sense. The remaining choices use the \"to go\" word, which can apply only to traveling, not to solving a problem. \n8. Choice A: Hunt for Food may sound sensible for solving the problem, so we can eliminate choice B: Sleep.\n9. There are two definitions of \"hunt\" in a dictionary of the Oxford English. \n10. The first one of hunting for or catching an animal is suitable, as it is easy for the neolithic man to act and hunt as he can still survive. \n11. However, the second definition, hunting or searching for a person, is better for a hunter, it is likely a person hunting for food can still be \"surviving\".\n12. If it was about hunting for a person, that would have been a better option for solving the problem.\n13. So the most suitable choice is the first one, in other words Hunt for food is the most logical choice.\n14. The word \"hunting\" also has two definitions here, however, it has to be done for food to solve the problem, it will not be done to get a person as the problem is finding food, so these words can also be excluded.\n14.

Therefore, the most reasonable choice is option C: feel humiliation.\n8. Choice C suggests that the person is looking for food because they are already feeling humiliated.\n9. Feeling humiliated in a survival situation could lead to desperation and a feeling of panic, so the person would be more motivated to search for food.\n10.

We need to find out which of the given options is opposite to a person who's too serious.\n5. Choice C: confident is the right choice for this question, as confident people are not overly bothered with things or details and would be able to handle everything easier.\n6. A confident person's mind would not be overwhelmed by stress, or anything for that matter.\n7. Therefore a person who is confident would not have the same traits of a person who's serious and stressed.\n8. Hence, what happens when somebody is too serious about things is that their mind is likely to be overwhelmed, but a confident person would not be overwhlemd by anything.\n9. So the answer is C: confident.\nAnswer: C, confident\n\nInput: After being with their friend, they were feeling ___________.

Choices:  Mow the lawn regularly A: Keep the lawn mowed B: Keep it looking nice C: Get a new one D: Hire a gardener E: Keep it looking nice and clean\nRationales: Choices 1. Mow the lawn on a regular basis would be the best way to keep a lawn maintained. 2. To \"Keep the lawn mowed\" would require that the lawn is mowed on a regular basis. Similarly, \"Keep it looking nice\" would need to be done regularly. 3. Although \"Get a new one\" or \"Hire a gardener\" could potentially keep the lawn mowed and maintained, the question instead asks about the \"most effective\" way to keep it beautiful. These options might not be the most efficient. 4. The remaining options, \"Keep it nice and clean\" is a general term and does not provide a specific detail on how to keep the lawn beautiful. 5. Hence, the option that is \"most effective\" is \"Keep the la-wn mowed\".\n\nAnswer: A Keep the lawn mown\n\nInput: A: There will always be a way to get to where you want to go.

Finally, we look at the remaining choice, which is C: feel humiliation or feeling humiliated.\n8. The option refers to a state of mind, however, it is stated in the previous part of the question that the neolithi person was actually physically hungry.

What other words do the choices describe? Choices:  a) bargain  b) craft  c) art  d) artistic  e) style\nRationales: Analysis:\n\n1. First, examine the question: \"The teacher needs to find a good place where students can learn about hand-lettered signs\".\n2. We want to identify words that describe \"hand-lettered signs\". \n3. Looking through the options, we see words such as \"art, craft, style, and artistic\", and we note that these words are not used to describe \"hand-letter signs\".\n4. This leaves us with the choice between \"beautiful\", \"hand-lettered sign\", or combinations of the two.\n5. First, look through the choices for the word \"beautiful\". A dictionary definition of this word is \"having very desirable or attractive qualities\".\n6. This suggests that \"beautiful\" describes something that appears appealing or nice. The word \"beautiful\", however, does not mention \"hand-lettered\" or \"sign\". \n7. Next, we analyze the choice \"hand-lettered\", which means \"made by writing each letter individually\", according to a dictionary. This indicates that \"hand-lettered signed\" describes something", "answer": " 48"}

Likewise, options C and D, which suggest feeling humiliated and sleeping, respectively, are not related to acquiring food. \n7. This leaves option E, which refers to preparing to hunt for food. This is a viable solution to a hungry person because it involves using one's physical and mental faculties to obtain a necessary resource.

Choices: A: no energy left B: no resources C: nothing they could do about it D: it was over in the previous 665 problems E: too much to do\nRationales:  1. The question provides information about \"the problem that was the 668th one for them\" and that they thought they had \"no energy left\". \n2. There is a reference in the sentence to the previous problem (the 666th problem), which is not provided in the question. \n3. Considering this information, we look for an action that would be taken in such a situation. \n4. First, we identify the option that involves the least amount of effort, since this question indicates a lack of energy. \n5. That leaves options B C E as they are more effortful than the others. But they can also relate to the context. \n6. Based on this, we rule out option B as it indicates they were running out of energy. This relates to having \"no energy left\" which is not the context given in the question. 7. Options C and E also relate to this. However, to say they had \"nothing they could do about it\", or \"it was over in 665 problems\" is too pessimistic for a group of people. 8. Additionally, to say they had run out of energy was not the correct explanation to give for having no energy.

Choices B and C: go hunting and sleep are not applicable either since they are general actions related to survival that cannot easily be used as a solution for the problem.

However, feeling humiliated is not a possible solution either because feeling humiliated doesn't lead to any action besides being sad or experiencing anguish.\n7. This leaves us with choices D and E: feeling humiliated and preparing to go.\n8. Preparing to go involves making arrangements to go looking for food, such as packing some supplies, deciding on a route, or making arrangements with others. \n9. Feeling humiliated could lead to an action of going to look for food if the person feels sufficiently degraded and embarrassed by their situation, and enough to want to do something about it, which is what we need for the solution. \n10.

Choices B, C, and D refer to emotions that are plausible in a situation where a person is hungry. However, feeling humiliated, sleeping, or being prepared to go are not ways to get food, and are therefore inappropriate choices for the question.\n8. Hence, the only option that is appropriate is choice E, prepare to go, as this means physically going and looking for food rather than feeling humiliated, not sleeping or being prepared to go. \n9.

Choices: A: interesting story B: proper plot C: a name D: decent work E: a cover\nRationales: In order to make a book that is \"good\" the author needs to make sure they have a \"proper plot\", \"name\" and \"decent work\". \n1. There are many reasons why authors write.\n2. Some may write for entertainment, others for money while most do it to express themselves and their thoughts.\n3. In order for a book to be good, the author must write an \"interesting story\" and a \"proper plot\".\n4. The author must also give \"decent work\" as they must put effort into writing their book.\n5. The author must also provide \"a name\" to their book so that it can be identified as one they wrote.\n6. Finally, the author needs to ensure their story also has \"a cover\" so that the book looks good when presented to people.\n7. There is no reason to remove any of the options given, as each option contributes to the overall \"goodness\" of the book as a whole.\n8.

When considering what the bicycle owner did to keep her bicycle in good condition, we must take into account the context of the question. It mentions her actions which included riding it on a muddy Path.\n2. The phrase \"was very careless \"in fact gives us clues as to the proper and expected action she should have taken, considering the condition of her bike.\n\n3. It was careless to drive on a muddy path, so to keep in good condition, She should have repaired the bike if there was damage from the bike.\n\n4.

We can rule out hunt as it would not directly provide food for the person as it would involve them to share it with those they hunt, e.g. their family.\n8. Since the person is likely alone, this excludes \"family\" from the options.\n9. Choice C: feel humiliation does not directly provide or satisfy the hunger as it is an expression of emotion.\n10. Choice D: feeling sleepy does not necessarily cause nourishment to be delivered as people may not be well-fed enough to sleep as a result from lack of food.\n11. Choice E: preparing to travel would not be a solution to the problem of hunger as this would delay when one actually finds food (as it only involves preparation with no immediate action of delivery).\n12.

Therefore,  Let's begin by summarizing the question.\n2. The question is about a stereo set, so we will be looking for things that a stereo set would have in common.\n3. We know that, a stereo set is made up of different types of equipment such as a mixer, subwoofer, speakers, amplifier, and cords.\n4. So, we have narrowed it down to three options: Cords, Speaker, and Rack.\n5. However a Bluetooth is not included because this is a wire device that is used to link devices together, so an example for this option is the Bluetooth speaker.\n6.

Next, consider C (pronunciation of words). It is possible that the speaker could be struggling with pronouncing words in another language, causing them to get words wrong. However, this answer does not specifically mention pronunciation problems and also, there is no reason to assume that there would only be one type of word that she would struggle with.\n3. For example, if her problem was with the 'r' sound in words, she could struggle with the names Brandy and Jasmine.\n4.

As a result of this reasoning, choice B is the most appropriate, as it would require them to hunt for food, a logical solution for someone who is hungry.\n8. Therefore, the right answer is B: hunt for a solution, as it is the only feasible and practical option.\nAnswer: B: hunt for solution", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": "because it would not find food.\n5. Choice C: feeling humiliated also does not lead to the procurements of food. This is because a person being hungry is already a humbling situation, and further feelings of humiliation would not help the person, who is already humiliated. \n6. Since the person already feels humbly due to their hunger, they cannot be humbled further. \n7. Hence, option B: hunting for food is the only valid solution to the problem as it is the only one out of the choices that would provide food. \n8. The question is about the hungry person and what they might do given their state of hunger, so the answer cannot be option E: preparing to go because this action depends on the person going elsewhere. The person might have to go, but they will not be able to go when they are hungry because of the limited resources available to them. \n9. So, from the available options, the best solution to finding nourishment when the neolithic man is hungry is to hunt for food. \n10.

Choices:  a: before blooming B: after petal falling off D: a green bump c: as it blooms e: after stamen dies\nRationales:  1. The choice D: a green bum is the correct answer.\n2. The word \"After\" in the question refers to when \"a flowes\"s sepal \"appear\".\n3. From the choices given, the sentence only indicates the events that occur before a flowers seals appear.\n4. The choices that don't occur before the flower's seep appear are B: after petal \"falling of\"\", C: after the \"green\" bump appears\" and E: after \"stamen dies\".\n5.

However, it does not directly tell us that the person will find food. It can be possible that the person will hunt and fail to find any food. To clarify, the question asks for actions that would lead directly to the acquisition of food.\n8. A more logical choice is Choice E: prepare to go. This choice suggests an action, which does not necessarily lead to the finding of food, but is a prerequisite to finding any food.\n9.

We see that there are two opposing movements (go North and South) and two corresponding movements (go West and go East).\n\n1. Since a fence has to be made, it could only be going in one direction to make the farm bigger.\n2.

At a conference, the organizers ask speakers to write to the audience.\n2. In this sentence, a conference is a very general noun that refers to any gathering of people. It is difficult to know if there was one specific conference for which the speakers were writing or if they were asked to write in advance for multiple conferences.\n3. The organizers ask speakers is a vague sentence, so we need to analyze the context to understand the specific request in more detail. So far, we have learned that the organizers of a conference asked speakers to write.\n4.

He could also respond by saying \"I want to get to know you\" which implies he is interested in further developing their relationship, but does not yet know enough about her to say that he loves her.\n3. Additionally, he could say \"I have a crush on (you)\" which would indicate that he is attracted to her but not necessarily in love with her.\n4.

The question tells us that voting was not always allowed. So if we assume it was never allowed before, then how does it cause problems now. Voting now is allowed.\n2. In case it was allowed only recently, then how can it cause problems currently.

This question describes a scenario where a maid, named Diana, sleeps in her vanity and a person asks the best thing a maiden can do for her.\n2. After analyzing the question, the key words we need to focus on are: \"a maid did for\", \"vanity\", and \"best thing\"\n3. The word \"maid\" indicates that the maiden is Diana.\n4. Then, we need to look at the choices given to determine the activity of the maiden. \n5. The choice that best reflects this activity is the one that has the most beneficial effect on Diana.\n6. However, the question doesn't specify what effect the maiden's action will have on Diana.\n7.

Choices: 1) The forest 2) The pine grove 3) The mountain 4) The meadow 5) The cave\nRationales: This question asks about the behavior of a grizzly in hibernation. We have two choices: \n1. \"The meadow\" or \n2. \"The mountain\". \n3. The mountain implies a higher elevation, whereas the meadow suggests a lower one. \n4. It may seem that the mountain is more likely to be an appropriate habitat for hibernate bear, but the question states \"the grizzly bear\". \n5. This is a term used frequently for grizzly, as opposed to the meadow. \n6. Therefore, only if we select the options by their names can we conclude that \"the mountain\" is the best choice. \n7. To make this determination, we can compare the names of the locations. \n8. \"The meadow\", \"the pine grove\", \"the forest\", are all location names, but \"the mountain\" is a generic descriptor.\n9. This means that, although the meadow might be a better habitat for grizzly bear, the mountain is a much narrower term and would be more accurate. \n10.

Out of C, D, and, E, we see that none of them is a practical means of satisfying the need for food. For example, in Choice C: feeling humiliated, the person does not actually get anything to satisfy his hunger. He simply experiences an emotion, and Choice C may even exacerbate the problem of being hungry because he may experience a decrease in energy.\n8. Choice D, to sleep, is also not practical because the person is already hungry. He would feel worse after sleeping for a while because he will wake up hungry.\n9.

Hence we need to determine an alternative action that could be taken to obtain something to eat.\n8. The answer must be to prepare and go somewhere, as this is the choice that fits the question\u2019s context. \n9. In this scenario, the person with the hunger is a Neolithic person, living during the Stone Age. \n10.

Choice E: prepare to go indicates that the neolithi person plans to leave a certain situation where they might be lacking food, however, this does not directly solve the problem. \n6. As a result, we can infer the most suitable choice given the context of the question, is Choice C, which implies that the person will feel humiliated.\n7. Hunger is a state of inadequacy for nourishment, which can potentially be resolved through the humiliated person's efforts to procure food.\n8. Therefore, the most likely response to the problem is the person will feel humbled and attempt to find food. \n9.

His eyes seemed to pierce through her soul. What was he doing all this time? Choices: 1: laughing, 2: studying, 3: thinking, 4: swaying, 5: starring\nRationale: 1. The word \"pierce\" connotes a look that can penetrate someone's soul, which is what makes her feel awkward and nervous.\n2. Based on the context, \"studying\" is not a suitable answer because it doesn't align with the question's description and connotation of his look.\n3.

Option C: feeling humiliated is not a solution to hunger because it does not lead to finding any sort of food.\n7.

Choice D: sleep is not a solution since the question refers to finding food. As such, choice D is excluded.\n8.

For instance, being humiliated can be a result of having to beg, and going to sleep can be a way to postpone action to the next day. \n5.

Choices:  A; chain B; franchise C; branch D; store  E; shop\nRationales: Let's breakdown each choice.\n\nA: The word chain in the options given means all of the stores that will carry the products will be owned by the same company.\n\nB: Franchise means permission or authorisation to do something in a particular place or to trade in a particular product. \n\nC: Branch means an extended part from a main stem, division or department of a business or organisation which deals with a particular activity or business. \n\nD: This would usually mean a particular shop or store. \n\nE: A shop would be something like a convenience store, with only a few products in it, and a small space.\n\nTherefore as long as the company would not be going to \"branch\" out or \"franchise\" out, the option that fits the definition of the word is B. \nSince the company is selling their products in the \"store\" belonging to other businesses.

Which emotion is she feeling? Choices:  a: bitterness b: indignation c: frustration d: disappointment e: selfishness\nRationales: The choices given are: a - bitterness, b - indignation, c - frustration, d - disappointment, and e - selfishness.\n1. The first step is to analyze each word and determine if it reflects the emotions the teacher is feeling.\n2. Next, we use these words to determine which one is most fitting based on the given context of the question.\n3. In this context, the teacher's job as a teacher is highly important. The given context, further implies that she might not be getting enough recognition for being a teacher.\n4. When we do so we can identify that the best choice here is selfishness as selfishness has to do with one's sense of entitlement and one's focus of gaining more than what is due.\n5.

Only choice E: preparing to go would involve an actionable step towards finding food.\n8. The term neolithic can be defined as \"recently made, especially of stone tools or other objects.\"\n9. Therefore, the neolithic is a period of human history that revolved around the development and use of tools made from stone and other materials before the invention of metal.\n10.

The word used to tell us this is \"happy\" and we need to know why they may be happy.\n1. The person then looks to the other to see if they are also happy.  The word \"happy\" is repeated.\n2. We know that the question is being directed to the person addressed.\n3. Once we are given the knowledge that both the asker and the addressed are happy, we need to determine why.\n4. We note that the person being asked has already spoken thus the person cannot be thinking about a past event but must be thinking about the present.\n5. Once we have analyzed all this additional information, we can then answer the question by determining which choice out of four applies.\n6.

Five weeks and a day. How long did she work there? Choices:  E: 3 weeks and a day A: 5 weeks B: 9 weeks C: 5 days D: 1 full week\nRationales: Based on the question: How long did she Work at the firm? Five Weeks and a day. How Long did she work there? \n1. 5 weeks and a day means that she worked at the firm for 5 weeks and an extra day.\n2. A week contains 7 days and the day is the final or last of 7. So 5 weeks plus One day.\n3. Five weeks equal to 5 weeks = 5 weeks + 1 day.\n4. Then (5 weeks ) + (1 day ) = 6 week including the first day.\n5. 6 weeks is equal to 5 weeks + 6 days and the day is 1. Then 5 weeks + 7 days = 5 weeks + (E) 3 weeks and a Day.\n6. The answer 5 weeks + (3 weeks and a Day) can be interpreted as 5 weeks + 3 weeks.\n7. 3 weeks = 3 weeks including 3 weeks = 1 week.\n8.

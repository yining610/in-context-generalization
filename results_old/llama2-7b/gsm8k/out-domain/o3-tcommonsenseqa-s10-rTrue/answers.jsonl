How many lawns and driveways did tobias shovel?\n3\\. Find the total that Tobias made from mowing the 4 lawns.\n4\\. Find percentage of total money that goes to shoe purchase, in terms of the amount of allowance.\n\nRationales:\n1\\. By comparing Tobias's initial amount of money (195) to the amount of money he had left after buying the 95 shoes, he had 100 dollars and 15 cents of change.\n2\\. To find how many lawns and how many driveways Tobais shovelled, we add his allowence of 5 to the first amount he had of 195, which is 200, to find how many lawn and driveways Tobias shoved, which were 10 and 8 respectively.\n3\\. To find the total that Tobias earned from mowing the four lawns, we add the amount he received from mowing each lawn, which was $60, to determine the total he earned from the four lawns which was $240.\n4\\.

A week is defined as 7 days, so to find the answer to the given question we will take the sum of the amount of time Tim spending biking each of his 7 days.\n\n### Time spent biking per day\n1. 5 weekdays is given (418 miles / 5 = 83.6 miles per day).\n2. 1 weekend bike ride is 200 miles (1 / (200 / 5) = 0.8 hours per day).\n3.

{"text": "The top cost for each $65\n\n### Dem:  Answer:\n\n- First we gather information. Ann bought $25 for $7 each and $25 for $10 each in a clearance.\n- Next we have $100, so we get 20.\n- We know 20 equals ten and $7 to $10 equal $25, so with $100 you can get $25 from $7, $25 from $10, or $105.\n- The $105 means that each item is $15 or five plus five, and the $25. And we have to get rid of the 20 because the 20 doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\n### Rationale:\nIt will clear the table, will you be correct in this one, and you, okay. So the price of the tops is 5 times $7 equals to $35, and 70 is divided into 3 times $10 equals to $30. So the total value for the 20 is going to $50, and the price of the 20 is 5 plus $15 is $20.

Which of the following would you choose?\n\n### Cards A: 10 for 100, B: 5 for 20, C: 4 for 80, D: 2 for 20.\n\nThere are only two options that are logical choices. The first is the choice of 4 for 8 $100 because it divides the money equally, but it is not what you expect for the $100. The number is 10, which is the exact amount you are supposed to spend.  The other one can\u2019t divide it evenly. Dividing it by 2 would give you no money left over. The best options are 5 and 10. \n\n### Rationales:\nThe answer of course is the 10 that you buy for 100.

{"text": "**Step 1:** The student's grade is an integer, while the teacher's percentage is the word 'percent'. One needs to convert the 40% to its equivalent fraction, so the answer can be found.\n\n#### **Step 2:** Divide the given percentage by 100.\n* In this case, the 40% is `100\u00d7(40/100)` (where the left hand is 100 and the '\u00d7' is a multiplication sign).\n* The 60 students is `60\u00d7100=6000`.\n* From this, one can write:\n\n`\u27f9 100\u00d7(60/100) =100\u00d7(10/10) = 10000/1000000 =40/104 `\n* This is similar to the fractional value `3/4` and `9/10`. This is why 40% to fraction is `100/25`, or equivalently, `100\u00d725\u00f7100 = 25`.\n* Thus, the correct math problem is `60/(60\u00d740/10)` and the number of students above B is `60*(70%\u00f725%)= 60\u00d7 (70/25) = (60\u00d73)\u00f7(60\u00d72) = 180\u00f7120=1.5` so the number of students above grade B is 180.\n* This number of students is rounded with 7 decimal places.

If Gallon is per inch of fish or Gallon is per fish, then the same Gallon is being repeated in both the tanks or there should be more number of three-inch fish in there second tank. Hence from the above it is clear that we should multiply the water in the first tank with two for every three fish which means one gallon per inch of fish but two gallons per fish in second tank and it gives the answer, it should be 25%.", "answer": " 3"}
{"text": "The sentence 'After a meeting, she typed 18 minutes more' can help us understand the given problem. If we rearrange this, the problem becomes: After the meeting ended, Janice was able to type for 18 more minutes than she had yesterday.\n### Demontration: This tells us that, at first, Janice had typed 20 more minutes than yesterday. Subtracting this 20 minutes from 18 minutes gives us that Janice was able to write 2 more minutes in addition to her 18 minutes. This would indicate that the problem starts at 119 minutes and not at zero minutes.\n### Response: We can use this to find the number of sentences she had previously typed at the start of the day. We can do this by rearranging the final sentence,'Janice had 536 total sentences for the day.' The problem can be rearranged like so: 'She had 536 from the first 20 minutes added to the 18 more minutes that started after the meeting.' From the addition of these two numbers, we can conclude that she has typed 536 sentences for the first 20+18=20+18 = 38 minutes. This would mean that she had 6 sentences typed for the first 38 minutes, the time before the meeting. This concludes that the answer to our question is that she has written 6 sentences for the first period.\n### Answer: A.\n\n### Input : You are in Japan and decide to order 14 bento boxed lunches. How much total does it cost to order?\n### Response: The given question, 'How much total does it cost', is similar to 'How much is 14's total'. We can see that the question asks for total and is referring to a number. Because the question says 'How much does it cost' it can't refer to a person or an object.\nTherefore, 'total' can't refer to people. This means 'cost per unit', 'unit', and 'quantity' can't be people, so they must be numbers.\n'Cost/Cost of/Quantity of' questions can always be translated into 'How much'. So, we can rephrase the question as: How much cost/quantity/unit's total'? We", "answer": " 258"}
{"text": "Happy street has 100 cars pass per day.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The two options A: 150 cars and E: 150 + 20 are impossible because they are inconsistent with the question. If we assume that Option A is correct, according to the options, Happy Street is a place where cars pass every day, rather than every week.\n2. Since Monday, Wednesday and Friday all have between 10 to 12 cars, we add these together and round to the nearest integer to produce 33 cars.\n3. Using this information, we assume that the total number of Happy Street cars is Option B: 33 Monday through Sunday. This is the optimal answer according to data available in the question. \n4. However, we can always assume Option C: 16 Monday through Sunday because, even if we cannot reach a specific answer, we can always assume anything that makes a question seem easier than it is.\n4. Or, if we assume option E: 154 Monday to Sunday, we can still do so because Happy Street has \"very little\" cars, so Option E is likely to be correct.\n5.

Based on the context of this question, we can determine the first thing to remove as an option because it doesn\u2019t fit the context: skates.\n2.

There\u2019s no sense to have \u2018skiing\u2019 in the question if we are not going to use it to eliminate an option.\n4. Similarly, shoes that do not require boots (such as flip-floos (Option E/ Option D) tend not to be the most commonly worn pair of shoes for winter skiing.\n5. Thus the options that we are left with are C: boots and D: shoes.\n6. So we should answer C: boots.

So if we buy 4 cases, the total cost would be $36 at the bulk ware house ($7.20*4). But at the grocery the total cost would be 40 ($7.20*$12) and the difference the customer pays for cases is 6 cents.

Also you may have to check for some conditions or restrictions from the question of how do you know these input is valid?\n\n### Example:\n\n### Input\n1\n2\n\n## Example:\n### Instruction\nIf the number is negative, then the number is a negative multiple of ten. If the number is positive, the number is a positive multiple of ten.\n\n### Example\n### Instruction 1:\n1. Start reading the data. For this example, there is 1 input line. This tells us to read the first input line.\n2. The first line contains the first input data which in this case is '1'.\n\nNow, 1 - 10 = -9 and 10 - 1 = 9  and 10 * 1 = 10\n\nTherefore the first input data is negative.\n3. Repeat steps 2 and 3, for the line in the input data\n\n### Output\nThe output should be the result of the given instruction:\n\nIn the given input:\n\n1. We start reading the input by going to the first input line. The first line contains an input of '1'.\n2. The first input data is -9.\n3. To verify, it should be:\n   1. 1", "answer": " 42"}

X = 5\n2. 40% of X is 0.2x - 19\n3. 55% of X is 2.7x - 32.4\n4. Difference in % is 8.4\n5. 5x is 22\n6. 40% - (0.2x -19) = 0.4x - 15.8\n7. 55% - 2.7x is 37.5 - 15.6\n8. 22 - 15.something - and therefore 8.something is a percentage\n9. 8.something can be rounded to say it's exactly 8\n10. 5x is exactly 22\n11.

However, the terms opposite of left and right are used to describe directions, and vice versa, not words.\n\nVice versa is also not appropriate. Vice versa is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase \"secundum verum vocatum\" or \"called according to the truth\", meaning \"in the opposite order\", a short way of saying \"in the opposite order from that which was previously mentioned\" or \"in the opposite order one would expect\". Vice Verse means \"according to [the] opposite order of [the] true [way]\" and \"opposite of [the] usual [mode of] conduct or [action].\"\n\n### Rationales\nBecause there are many things that you can do. For example: forward, back, move, stop, stand, down, up.\n- You might get confused and choose the wrong antonym that has nothing to do with the original word or phrase.\n- The correct answer is the opposite of left, and the opposite of left means right.", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "She would pay $700 more for rent, $125 more for food, and $900 more for car insurance.\n\n### Rationale:\nThis rationale first outlines the question format and provides an example for comparison.\n\n* This question, like many questions that are multiple choice or similar, asks how much more the response answers rather than why one is chosen over another.\n* Thus, although it is helpful to understand why one choice is chosen over another, this is less important with multiple choice, open response style or similar questions. Instead, the focus is on figuring out a way to find the answer or the best answer.\n\nThis response then outlines all the details provided and points out what is relevant towards answering the question.\n\n* Since the question is about how much more she pays each comparison category of expense over the whole year, we need to find all the costs in the comparable expenses in the two years.\n* In the question, the costs for rent, food, and car insurance were provided for both years as a sum. This means we need to calculate how much each category has changed.\n* First, we need to find the total amount for each category to compare the answers. We need to find the year-to-year difference on the answer for each category, as follows. \n* The answer for overall expenses over the year is $11,450.\n\nNext, we find the total cost for each category which is $3,200 for rent, 2,400 for food, $450 for car insurance. These totals can be found by subtracting the original amount for each category from the total cost. Then, we subtract the old and new costs together to find the increase.\n\n* First, we subtract the current cost of $1000 from the original old cost of $1080. This gives us $80:\n\n$1070 - $1000 = $70\n\n* Then, we need to subtract the old amount for each category from their increased amount.\n\nNext, to find new cost for food, we subtract $150 and the amount we already got for rent.\n\n**$200- $150- $80 = $70**\n\n* Finally, all the increase answers together from all the categories", "answer": " 7200"}

{"text": "Solution:  Step 1.  First of all, we examine the available quantities.  We understand that Lily has 5 lotteries which she sells to the winner.  So she needs to find the quantity that she can keep as profit and give the remaining amount as the prize.  We do this by using the formula Q=P+V, where Q=Quantity, P=Profit and V=Variable.  Then the profit P is the remainder (the rest of the total) after we subtract the Quantity V (the total number of tickets sold).  In this example we are making the profit $4, while the total ticket sales is $5.  This means that to find the quantity the winner gets to sell to us, we need to divide the $4 by the $5.  This gives us the quantity V, which is $1 in this example.  The quantity Q (the profit) is then $4 minus 1, which is $3.  To find Q, we need to subtract Q from V and we get -$1.\n\n    > A) Quantity:4  Profit:3\n\n    > B) Quantity:5  Profit:2\n\n    > C) Quantity:6  Profit:1\n\n    > D) Quantity:7  Profit:0\n\n    > E) Quantity:8  Profit:-1\n\n### Answer:Solution:A: Quality: 4  Profit: 3", "answer": " 11"}

There is no ambiguity about the number of days. Given that there are 45 total days, there must be either no events, or 0 events. \n\n### Response\nIf all the days are labeled with events, that means there are no empty days. This is a contradiction, so it must be that every third day is labeled 'no events' and every two other days are labeled with an event. If there are 45 possible days, this would mean only 12 of the days have no events. 1 / 3 + 1 / 2 = 7 / 6, so there must be one event free day in every 6 days.

The key feature of the deductive system is that it is a process in which someone will assume information and then use it to produce answers to problems. As the name suggests, the deductive method involves deduction. It is a process in which several facts are combined to produce a conclusion. Conclusions are always accurate. The deductive method starts with a statement that is called a premise followed by other statements that are called assumptions. The goal of the deductive method is to examine the assumptions and make sure that each premise of the assumptions that we will use as the foundation of our conclusions.\n\n### Guided Response\nSolving Problem #1,  the first task is to find out the totals amount which she will use to buy cooking gear for her nieces. To accomplish this task we will take the total amount of money ($32)  and multiply it by 3 and subtract 32 from $40.\n\nNext we will divide the total amount that we found by 4 which is the ratio of the total amount of the cooking gear ($10/ 4 dollars for cooking utensils and 10 dollars for the set of 3 cooks utensils).

School bus can  be used for multiple purposes. \na) It can  be used to transport students, \nb) It can be used to take students on recreational  trips, \nand it can be also used to transport teachers,\nschool staff etc.\nThe variety of uses of the bus determines how the school bus will  be used.\nSince \"It depends on how\" is an independent choice, the answers \"C:  it depends on how\" and  \"D: It is the bus of your choice\" can be eliminated. \n3. \"Type of school\". This is an independent choice, \nand so it cannot be used to eliminate one more school bus.\n\n4. So among the options \"It is the bus with the  best seatbelts\", \"It is the bus you like\", and \"It  is the bus that runs smoothest\", \nit is the school bus that \"has the best gas mileage\" that is  the best choice.\n\n#### Input: What kind of fuel should be used for cooking, gardening or heating, if you want less smoke?\n\n1. When cooking or fumigating, you should use a wood fuel with no additives or smoke additives.\n2. When heating, you should use coal, which can produce smokeless heat.\n3. If you want", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "Wholesale price is $15.\n\n### Rationale:\nFrom the question we can tell that if the retail price of a pants would be $36, then the wholesale price should be less than that, and we can use that to solve the question.\nThis is because as we said, the retail price is $36 and the shop owner adds 80% on to this price, to that means that, the retail price should be more than a pants' wholesale price.\n\nNext we can figure out a formula, which is:\n\nWholesalePrice = RetailPrice * \\(\\frac{1}{0.8}\\)\n\nIf we substitute the values, using the values the question has provided about the retail price of $36 and 80% addition the retail price, we get:\n\nWholsealePrice = $15\n\n### Another Example\n\nInput: What time of day does an elephant usually eat its food? Choices: \nA: noon B: midnight C: 5pm D: none of these\nRationales:\n1. To solve this question, we need to be aware of the kind of animals involved. If we start thinking about it, elephants are definitely not nocturnal animals. We can say this because \"nocturnal\" means active at night, which would contradict the question.\n2. Likewise, \"midnight\" and \"5pm\", would not really make sense in terms of an elephant's eating schedule. If an animal is in the wild, the food schedule is usually a daily routine. \n3. Therefore, there is an implication that this is a zoo animal that the question is talking about, and so the options we need to look at are: \n\"A: noon\" and \"B: 5pm\". \n4. From the question, the answer is A: noon or 5pm. Choice A: noon is ruled out because, as we said above, an elephant is not the kind of animal that would act in a nocturnal way.\n5. Now, looking at the choice B: 5 pm, we can determine that the answer is B: 5pm since 4pm to 5pm is a normal noon meal time", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": "$785.00\nRationales:\n1. The key to answering this question is determining what each item cost and how this value is calculated.\n\n2. Since everything is in US dollars and we know that the amount of money is the same as the value of everything, converting each expense into monetary or numeric value is logical.\n\n3. To determine the cost of purchasing the piano, we first subtract the discount value of 25% from the total value of $500. Therefore, the cost of purchasing a piano is $375.\n\n4. Piano lessons cost $40 per lessons and the total number of piano lessons are 20.  The cost of piano lessons = $40 * 20 = $800.\n\n5. The total cost of purchasing the $500 piano and taking $800 in piano lessons is $2995.\n\n6. However, after $250 is taken off the total, the final cost of everything is $785.\n\n### Response\nAnswer: $785", "answer": " 1100"}

{"text": "|Option|Number|Amount left|\n|-------|------|----------|\n|A) Nellie|11|19|\n|B) Jacob|7|23|\n|C) Lana|5|27|\nAnswer: B: Jacob\n\n### Rationale:\nThe total number of candies eaten was 30. So, the options must be for the number of candies each of the three people will get. Here is a methodical breakdown of why the answer is 7:\n\nSince 30 has been eaten and the rest have been equally divided, each person get their remaining. There are only 30 candies left in the total.\n-For Nellie, 12* 30 = 360, so total left = 30 - 360 = -320\n-For Jacob, 6* 30 =180, so total left= 30 - 180 = 150\n-For Lana, 5*30 = 15, so total left=30 - 15 = 15\n\nHence, since 360, 150 and 15 all have negative values, the ones that are not negative will receive more candies = Jacob because he has a total of 7, but Nellie and Lana have a negative value. \n\nAnswer: B: 7", "answer": " 3"}

Assume that the money was added to the piggy bank once per month. The first month's money of $3,00 is added into the piggy.\n2. Assume that there is no $500 left after each deposit. By using the simple exponential formula, we can create the total amount that has been deposited in the 4 yrs. We can use the formula A=P*(1+i)t to get the amount. In this case t is 4 yrs. So, $3,00=P*(1+12.67%/12)t. P is the initial amount that Sheila had saved. When we apply the percentages from the problem, we get $7718. 12.67=i, meaning that the money is compounded monthly.\n3. The remaining money would be the sum of $3,025 which is the total deposited in the 1st year and the sum of $3854 which is the total deposit in the 2nd year.

As we have three batches of pizza in the oven, we can determine that each batch needs to be cooked for ninety minutes.\n\nInput: If the oven can only cook two pizzas at a given time, it will take eighteen batches, or ninety-three, before the pizzas are completed.\n\nInput: We can determine that it will take Camilla thirty minutes to finish making one batch, and eighteen batches to finish making the twelve pizzas total. This leaves us with (30/3.6)*18 hours or 3.6*18 or 60 hours, which is 3/4 of a day of one hundred sixty hours, or 3.6 days or about 120 hours. Camilla must continue working for another twenty six hours on top of the 60 hours so far.\n\nAnswer: 120 hours + 26 hours = 146 hours.\n\n### Input I: After a test is given in her high school class, a 15-year-old girl named Sophia finds that she scored higher than 48% and lower than 2%.

We have 6/x of the pineapple, which we can cut in half to get 6 / 2x of the pine apple. This gives us 2x for the total cuts of the original pineapple and 3x/2 for the cost of a half cut of the pineapple.

So, she could drive by 4 if she just goes at a safe speed because she can avoid skidding on ice or regaining control while driving. However, if the temperature drops below the safe point, then she needs to wait. As an example, if the temperature is 0 and the chance to skid and lose control is 50%, then the chances of her regaining control if she goes into skid is not likely. In this case, she won't drive.

The correct answer required understanding what was meant by \"combustion engines\".  Without careful analysis of such details, one can make incorrect assumptions about the answers. It is easy to become attached to our answers, even if the initial details of an inquiry or argument may seem to be pointing in a potentially contradictory direction. While this can be helpful to narrow down what we think the correct answer should be, it has no bearing on whether the answer we come up with is the one that the test wants. Therefore, it is important to always evaluate multiple possible answers and remain open to changing one's beliefs. We must be careful when responding to inquiries so that we do not confuse ourselves about what our original assumptions were.\n\nIn addition, the example above also showed that while being in the 'comfort' zone can be helpful in our personal lives, a similar dynamic is present in coding.

{"text": "4 years.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe first thing to notice is that there seems to be a lot of detergent pod.  So we'll start by counting the number of months in the year.  We know that the month is 30 days long, so that is the maximum number of detergent pod we need. \n1 year / 30 days = 360 packs.  However, our question is: \"How many packs of datergent pods will he  need *to do* a full year of laudry.\"  There is an emphasis on doing, implying that each of the three loads must be completed.  \n1 year = 365 days. As a load (and a wash) can only be done 1 at a time, we can subtract 1 day from each day.  That's why we get 360.  We can then figure out, as a result, the number of packs we need by dividing 1 by 360, giving 0.002778. To convert the decimal to a fraction, we put a 365/1000 over the 00277. \nIn the next step, we divide 39 by 0.000365, and get 1024.  As the number of pods a pack has, we take a full 1024 pods and use them for our year. \nThis means he will need 1024 packs to do his entire year's laundry.\n\n#### Input: How many feet of wire would be needed to connect the following circuits to a battery? 15 in total.\n\n### Respond:\n- 3 x 5: 9 feet - 3 feet between battery and first outlet\n- 4 x 6:10 feet - 3 feet\n-3 x 9: 27 feet - 3 feet left for a spare\n-6 x 7: 42 feet - 3 feet at first outlet\n\n### Explantation: This is the question: \"How many feet of wire would you need to connect the following circuts to a battery\". \"connect circuts to a battery\" and how many feet of wire would", "answer": " 4"}

He simply just let them go on for another turn.\n### What's more, the rollercoaster has a maximum capacity of 80, but at that time, all 7 cars are full.\n### We can calculate the maximum capacity per time the rider can use the rollercoaster. So at the time of this maximum capacity can be carried out 7 times of 84 the ride operator has to stop everytime he needs to run the rollercoswter that to give each queue a rider 1 turn.\n### So, the maximum number of times the rollercoaster can be operated for one turn to give each rider one and run again is 7.\n### Answer:\n### \n### B: the roller coaster has to be operated 7 times in order to let each rider to 1 turn. \n### Answer: B: 7\n\n### Inst", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "**1.** First, we must define that the tree is in an upright, vertical position.

While there are branches, the leaves cannot stick on the branches all of the time if they are falling off.\n2. **2.** This assumption stems from our initial assumption that leaves fall from a vertical tree downward. If we assume that leaves do fall off the tree or leaves fall off and then stop falling as they impact with the ground, we will end up with the correct answer.\n3. **3.** This assumption stemms from our initial assumptions and our definition of falling. If we assume leaves never fall off the tree, we end up with one falling leaf and one un-falling leaf.\n4. **4.** This is a consequence of definition of falling and of our initial assumption. If 4 leaves fall in two hours and 2 leaves fall in one hour, then 6 leaves would fall in total and thus 2 leaves per hour would average that time period.\n5. **5.** This is a logical conclusion of the given information and our initial assumptions. First, we assume that at least 4 leaves fell in two hours, therefore 4 leaves fell per hour. Secondly, we assume that 2 leaves fell in the third hour, so 2 leaves fell per hour (again).

The word \"I am not an...\" in the sentence indicates the person is trying to express what they do not like. Since Option B includes the negative word \"not\" it fits the context more closely.\n2. Option A expresses something the person does like instead of doesn't like. Since the person appears to not like exploring the forest, Options B seems more appropriate.\n3. Option C refers to exploring a forest by walking. Since the context of the question is specifically about what the person would prefer spending time doing, C cannot possibly be the best option. Additionally, to \"prefer\" something, the person must be thinking about what they would rather do, therefore the person in this context would rather spend time in town centres.\n4. In Option D, the verb \"to explore\" is in reference to going to a place, not exploring that place. Additionally, the person appears to not be the type of person to appreciate spending time in the forest as opposed to the town centre.

To determine fuel needed for 490 miles, it only needs that we multiply the latter result with 490.\n\nAnswer: 490 gallones.\n\n### Instr : In a country that is only one square mile in area, there are only 333 people. If each person owns exactly 1 horse, 10 sheep, and 20 cows, how many cows are in the country?\n\n### Instru : \n\nLet's see what the numbers given in the question are:\n- 333 people\n- 1 sheep\n- 1 cow\n\nThese are the available horses, sheep, and cows.\n\n### Response : We can define the variables as follows :\n```\nh = ( 1 horse / 1 person )\ns = ( 1 sheep / 333 people )\nc = (1 cow / 333)\n```\nThen according to the question\n```\n(h * s) + (c * c) = 20\n  ==> h * 20 = 2c\n```\n\nSo the answer is that \"There are 20 horses in a country that is only 1 square mile in area, while there", "answer": " 106000"}

Write a response that appropriatly completes the request. \n\n### Demostration: Answer: \n1. \"What did John want to do?\" is the primary question that requires an answer. Therefore you must first answer the question.\n2. In order to answer the question, you need to figure out why John built the rockets.\n3. John likely wanted to test how to best build rockets and test his skill on rockets.\n4. There would be multiple rockets but for the sake of simplicity he is testing 500ft and 2X200ft.\n5. John's goal can be stated as: \"John tests his own skill in building rockets.\"\n6. He isn't a professional rocket scientist, so he would want to test his own skill with rocketry.\n7. In conclusion: John built the rockets in order to test his own skills with a certain craft.\n8. Therefore the answer most definitely is: \"Figure out why John built the rocket.\"\n9. The goal of the rocket-building experiment is to test John's abilities.\n10. You are not being asked to speculate on the experiment or what John meant by it. You must ask yourself what they are trying to achieve.\n11. The goal of this experiment is to find how each rocket works, so they want to test their height.\n12. This means they can test two rocket's height by combining them.\n13. The first step would be to determine which answers are best. First you must find out what options can be taken. \n14. Once this has been done, you can apply your knowledge and come to a conclusion.\n15. This concludes the answer.\nAnswer:  \"Test rocket height\"\n\n# PART 1: \n## MATH\n*1.

Space Shuttle: Since a Space Shuttle is not a fixed structure on earth, a space walk done in it, would be done on earth and it would be a pointless exercise to have an astronaut perform a space walk in that room.\n\n2. International Space Station: The international Space Station is a huge station around the Earth that is manned by astronauts. However, this is not a space walk done in space nor would it be required to perform a space walk. Therefore, it does not fit the criterion mentioned in the question.\n\n3. Russian space station: Russian space station is a huge manned space station that orbits the earth. The Russian space station may be used for space walks performed by their astronauts, but this is not the only role played by the Russian space station. Therefore, this would not be classified as a room where an astronaut needs to do a space walk. While some space walks might be done by astronauts using the Russian space station(depending on location of the Russian space station), the Russian space station would not be a room where an astraught is said to have to do a space walk in its room\n\n4. Moon base: A moon base is a permanent setup that is found on Moon. Moon base is also located on another planet and therefore does not have all the necessary apparatus for performing a space walk outside of its environment.

{"text": "One of the best mathematical model in which parking lots are considered has only two locations, one that is very small and one that is very big. This model has a lot to do with the size of the parking lot and the number of people that are arriving to use it.\n```\nA vehicle arrives to park\nif (parking lot in use) then park in larger space.\nelse go to smaller space.\n```\nIf the larger space is filled, vehicles cannot park there. They can either park in the smaller space, where they may cause the small space to fill up too. So more than half the vehicles will park in the larger space.\nThis model can also be used to represent an actual parking lot. The only real difference is that the larger space is actually much bigger than the much smaller space.\nIf the smaller space is limited to whatever number the question requires, then the larger space may be assumed to be big enough to hold any number of vehicles.\nDuring a play, vehicles will arrive, then people will leave to go home. Once the play is over, any cars not at the play may return.\nThe question reads that total number of cars was 700. If a total of 100 cars were present at the starting of the play, then the starting number is 100, the average number at the end (no cars arriving or leaving) is 700/2 = 350.\nFor each additional car that stays during the play, we add the average of the number of new cars arriving. The average of the new cars arriving is equal to 700/3=233.3. Therefore, the cars added during the play is 350 + 233.3 = 583.3.\nSince the play has begun, we can conclude from this that the number of cars that arrive equals (100 + 583.2. Therefore, the number of cars added during the play.\nSo the answer is 583.\n\n### Output: The answer is 582.3 cars.\n### Rationale:  The question is asking for the sum of the cars that are going in the parking lot during a live play. To find the answer we need to define what a live play it to be.\n```\nA live play, in this context, means", "answer": " 300"}

There are multiple ways to do this, and the conversion needs to be made in order to get a single array instead of multiple lists.\n2. We first convert the numbers into an array using square-bracket notation, which means enclosing it in brackets and not using commas. \n3. We then convert the array to a list using the dot notation, which takes the array and passes the first value to it as an input.\n4. We then convert the list back into an array by using the same dot notation but with square brackets this time instead of the [] notation.\n5. Arrays are written with square brackets, which means we convert the array back to the original version by using the same [] notation.\n6. We can then display the array using the same method that is used to display a list, which is double-square-bracket notation.\n7. Therefore we can display an array by creating an array using the square brackets notation, converting it into a list using the dot-notation, converting it back to an array using the same dot-notation but with square brackets this second time, and finally displaying the array using the dot notation but with double brackets.\n8. The above is the order in which to do the computations in order to display the array.\n(Note that we could have followed a similar order to write the array instead of using the dot-notation to get the array back in the first place, which would skip these steps).", "answer": " 2,950"}

Then when Malcom \"has 8 more cards than brandon\", he now has a total of 28.\n4. He then proceeds to give half of his cards to an anonymous friend \"Mark\".\n5. Now, he has 14 cards left instead of 28. The sentence structure here implies that the total number is now below 28 instead of above. This implies that the number of cards has reduced.\n\n### Output:Malcom now has 14 baseball cards.\n\n----", "answer": " 14"}

The first two numbers come from the question's answer choices. Since \"Carl takes away 4 pinks hard hats and John takes away 4 pins hard hats,\" we can answer these two questions pretty quickly.\n2. John took away x number of greens, so Carls took away 2x number of greens.\n3.

{"text": "Each bird eats 108 beetles per day The question can be simplified and restated like this: The number of birds eaten by the jaguars each day is equal to the total number of jaguars divided by the number of times each jaguar eaten a bird. There are six jaguars, therefore, six divide by five is equal to one. This means that each jaguar ate one bird per day.

{"text": "Answer: $129\n\n### Rationales:\n1.The best way to figure out what this question is asking is to read the question several times to identify the key words.\n2.Once the key words have been identified, one needs to figure out what the question is asking.\n3.The key words that can be extracted from the question include: \"Ava's birthday\" for context, \"bought\" to indicate that something has changed.\n4.This means that Ava either didn't have a pi\u00f1ata before or she didn't have these treats before.\n\n5.Continuing on, one should read the phrase \"filled it with all of her favourite sweets\".\n6.As it refers to Ava having a favourite treat, it is safe to assume that she already has sweets, and the question asks about the quantity of sweets. \n7.Next, one should read the rest of the question.\n8.The key phrase in the question is found in the sentence \"For $13 and filled\".\n9.This suggests that $13 is for the pi\u00f1ata and whatever it is filled with cost $13 as well.\n10.So the total cost of the pi\u00f1ata would be $26.\n11.This is the first step in the reasoning behind our response.\n\n12.The next stage of reasoning is to figure out what exactly is being sold to Ava so that we can get an idea of what the total amount of treats is.\n13.This can be done by following the sequence of events in the passage: Ava's parents bought the unicorn pinata. Then they bought four bags of REEs, three bags of Snicks and five bags of Skitts'.\n14.The four bags of the Reeses cost $42 and it is implied that it's for the four bags of the Skittles.\n15.This is because one bag of Skittles costs $7 and the fifth bag has been bought. \n16.Similarly, the five bags of Skittle's cost $35.\n17.This is the second step in the reasoning behind the response.\n\n18.Now we have to piece together the total cost of what is being sold to Aver for her birth", "answer": " 99"}

Choices:  C: Jingles D: Jingle E: Jingles\nRationales: This is a simple question with a simple answer. We can just ascertain that option 'D' is probably a mistake.

Other sounds like 'd, s, g, z' could have been used and this does not appear to be the case.\n\nInput: At what time does a cow graze?

There is no specified day and time of the day. And, it doesn't make sense that a cow would only graze during 'night time', which would be the evening.\n\nInput: What did you use if your family has a barbecue?

{"text": "Krystian borrows a total of 30 books a week in the library.\nRationales:\n1. We know he borrowed an average of 4 books daily.\n2. For Friday he borrowed an average 5 books daily.\n3. Summing up the borrowed books for Monday through Friday we get 22 books which means that on Sundays he either borrowed zero books or did not borrow any.\n4. Subtracting the number of books borrowed by Friday gives us 40 books in the first place and hence the difference of 40 books on Monday.\n5. Therefore, with the same number of books borrowed for Monday to Friday we can deduce that the sum on a weekly basis is 30 books.\nKrystian works 234 hours per week. On weekends, he works only 120 hours out of 168. How many hours does he work in a month?\n\n### In response:\nHe works 313 hours in a month.\nRationales\n1. Krystian works only 60 minutes a week on Sunday. Monday through Saturday he works 720 minutes.\n2. This amounts to 12 hours per working day.\n3.

{"text": "James ends up spending $5,000 out of pocket. \n\n### Rationale:\nTo begin, we take the car $20,090 that James sold and subtract how much he sold it for ($16,000).  We know from the last step that he sold it for 80% so the difference between the two (the amount James got for his old car) is 20%. \n\nThe next thing we do is subtract the sticker price of the new car, which in this case is $30,090.  We know because we subtracted 80% from the old sticker of the car ($20,00).  We subtract $30,050 from $30,075 so that we have the number of dollars that he spent on the new car.\nThe amount of dollars James spent on his new car would be $5,050.  We add half the amount that he saved on his old car ($20,140 - $16,0090) to what he spent on his new car ($10,550). $30,140 + $11,550 is $41,790.  So, he bought his new car for 90%, which means that he saved $41,740 - $11,579. $41,759.  To get our answer, we add these two together for a total of $51,729.\n\nOur final answer will be $5,001.  This is the difference between the amount James is out of pocket with, which is $52,724 to $47,722.

Given our assumption that Captain America, Ironman and Thor represent the same characters portrayed in different movies/comic books, then Thor is 13 times over than Captain America in terms of age. This means that Captain America is 13 years younger than Thor.\n2. Additionally, we have learned that Peter Parker, also Ironman, is 32 years younger than Captain America.\n3. From this, it can be concluded that Peter Parker is the youngest among the characters while Captain America is the oldest, and Thor is somewhere in the middle.\n4. Now, we can use this information to solve the problem. The key insight is that Ironman is 31 years younger than Captain America (32 years-1 year). Therefore, Captain America is 42 years older than Ironman.\n5. Similarly, Thor is 13 years older than Captain America. This means that Captain is 32 years old.\n6. So, we're left with Ironman + 13 years = Captain America. Therefore, Thor = Captain America + 13 years.\n7. As Ironman is 3 years older than Peter Parker, Ironman needs to be 32 years old to make 50% older than Peter Parker. \n8.

{"text": "The number of dinner rolls still left after the party is A: 12\n\n### Demostration:\n1. We can solve this by making assumptions, starting from 2 points provided: \n    - The first half of the guests have an equation: (P*T)/2 = r\n    - The second half of the guests have another equation: (P*t)/2 = 0.5r\n2. Given that there is still an uneven portion of guests who have yet to finish their meal, so r > 0.5r,\n3. We can multiply both equations and see that: ((P*T)/2)*(0.5T)/2 + (P*T)/4 = r^2\n4. Now from the equation above, we set r^2 = r*T/4 by dividing two sides, whereby (t*(r^2)/2 - r*T/4) = 0. Thus, we get r^2 is equal to 2r*T/4 - 1, which is 2r*T (2r^2 - 1)/4 which is (( P*T)/2)^2 ( 2 - 1/4).\n5. From this, we can now determine the number of leftover dinner rolls as follows: 4 * [(( {P*T}/2)^2*(2-1/4})- (P*T/2)]=4((((P*T)/2)^(2)(2-1/4))) - (4*(P*T/2)).\n6. From the above, it is clear that the total number of leftovers is 4P^2T - 4P^2, where P is the number of people at the dinner party, T is the total number of dinner rolls brought.\n7. To find the number of remaining dinner rolls, we just subtract P^2T from 4P^2 and get the answer as A: 12. This is due to there being 4P^2 - 4P = P^2 remaining (4(25)) - (25) = 12.

{"text": "The number of Buicks is given below.\n\nAnswer: B: 46\n\n### Demostration:\nRules: 1. Given the context of the question(an individual collecting model cars), it is safe to make assumptions about collectors.\n2. A collector is by definition someone who makes a hobby of collecting objects, a collection can be of several things whether it is cars, stamps or anything else. The context also suggests that Jim collects model cars because otherwise the question would be: \"how many models does Jim have?\" \n3. One can reasonably assume that a person collecting car models would definitely have more model cars of each given brand than the number of another brand that they have. Otherwise it would not be worth collecting all those cars.\n4. Jim has 4 times more Buicks than the amount of Fords he has and 3 times more than twice the number he has of Chevys, this makes Buicks the most dominant brin of Jim's car collection, it is more likely that he has the most number of Buicks rather than any other given brand.\n5.

Given that one person spent 9.15 and it is given that each person spent as much money as they had, it means that they didn't spend all the money they brought and rather they have some amount of money left over.

{"text": "**Solution:**\n\nTo calculate the number of students who did not read anything, we first have to find out how many students read three or more books. To do this, we can subtract the percentage of students who read three or more novelties (1/6).

It is not clear if it has any meaning in this context and even if it does, 'irregardless' does not necessarily change the logic of solving such a problem (as we don't have any information about the number of people who took wine and soda).\n\nC: The number of people = 26+22+17 = 85\n\nD: The key words of the problem here are 'who took wine' and 'who took soda'. These phrases indicate the 'person' as an entity which is singular and thus can't have both, 'who took wine' + 'who took soda'. If we were to add 'water' to D then 'whatever someone at the gather took' is the same as taking them, and the logic doesn't change.\n\nE: The question is phrased ambiguously in that it says 'number of people'. We can only use this number for the total number of people present to make any statements if they took wine or soda or both.

However, as $150 * 150 = $31000 in total to have been paid for 150 piece of furniture in total.$31000 * 155 = $16790 $30000 - $16795 = $13205. This means that if you bought 155 furnitures, you would pay $3000 additional. Since you paid the entire balance of $20750, and you were suppose to have purchased 150 furnitures, the correct amount of return will be 155-150 = 5.

Hours is simply used to indicate that the Skipper traveled at a constant speed (or a constant speed and time) for 20 hours without changing paths.\n2.

{"text": "The answer is $305.50\n### Rationale:The only problem I faced on this question is that it is 3:00 pm and my head is about to fall off. Since it's such a simple question, I decided to just use a little bit of brute force to solve it and try not to think about it too much. But I'll try to explain how I got the answer.\n\nThe first thing to do is to write down each step of the question. This ensures that there are no silly typos. So, my steps were written below:\n\n> Monika spent $250 at the mall\n\n> She then spent $24 for 3 movies\n\n> She bought 20 bags or beans in the farmers market for $2.50\n\n> Now, add them up and we get $305.00.\n\n### The only thing that wasn't totally straightforward was determining how much Monika spent on the movies. I just assumed that she spent $24.\n\n### Now, I know I'm probably not going to get into college and I'm honestly getting pretty fed up from trying to remember every last detail from this damn test. But it was pretty interesting the way my mind began to work with these type of question. I found it almost comforting. And that's what stuck with me, the idea that these simple logic problems aren't just a waste of time but really were actually kind of fun to figure out. I guess that's why I got into programming in the first place anyway and not English. So I think that's the take away. You know, if you're a little nervous about the SAT, then remember to try and enjoy the little things because the end of the day, your English grade won't affect your chances at getting into College, but if you're good at solving logic games then colleges won't know what to do with you.", "answer": " 347"}

{"text": "Answer: A: 30\n\n### Explanation:The question clearly asks about the number of minutes where he worked on Wednesday exceeding the number of minutes where Matt worked on Tuesday. \nHence, given that Matt worked for 4.5 x 240 = 1080 minutes and 450 minutes respectively for Monday and Tuesday, the total number of minutes worked on both the days combined is 1080 + 450 = 1530. Here I am only taking the case of working hours on Monday and Tuesday and not the whole given day. Similarly, Matt worked for 6.5 x 220 = 1390 minutes and 150 minutes respectively for Wednesday and Tuesday, and the total number of minutes where he works on both the days combined become 1390 + 150 = 1740. \nHence Matt worked for 1530-1740 = -210 minutes. \nHence the required number of minutes is -210 + 1530 = 1320. And the required number of hours for -210 is H=1/60 x 1320 = 22. If we take each working hours separately, then the required number of hours on Wednesday becomes 1530 - 30, which is 1500 - 30 = 1470.  \nThe required number of hours on Tuesday is H = 1744 - 150 = -24\n. There fore H = -24 x 60 = -1440.Hence the required number hours on Tuesday - Wednesday becomes 22 + -1440 = (1462 + 22) hours\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following algebra question:\n\n### Input : Let r = 6 and n = 3.

{"text": "To correctly solve this question, one first needs to understand how Tonya is spending her money correctly. She has enough money to buy 4 dolls and 2 lego sets, which totals to three gifts per sister. She now needs to decide the amount to set aside for each gift since she intends to buy the exact same amount for each of her two sisters. \n\n### Demostration:\nThis is a good example of a \"how much left?\" type question where a student can use a number line. By using a number line, we can see that if she bought $30 worth of dolls and then $70 worth of Lego sets, she'll have $20 left over (because each legoset is $20).\n\n### Rationales: 1) Tonya buys four dolls for her younger sister, 2) After this, she is left with $40 total.\n2) Tonya wants to spend the exact amount of money on both her younger and older sister. (So, it is a requirement that she spend exactly $40 on each doll). We can therefore define that for Tonya to achieve her goal, she would need to buy 2 sets of Legos.\n3) As her younger sister is not yet old enough to have Lego sets, Tonya first opts to buy dolls for her youngest sister. She then has $40 left. \n4) From this amount, Tonya plans to buy 2 Lego sets to make sure that she spends equal amounts on both sisters, but 1 lego set is left. \n5) This means Tonya already has $20 left over and thus the amount of Lego sets she must buy equals two.

{"text": "48/3=16 containers of milk\n### Justification:\n1. We are only considering the number of containers of milk Emma buys \"in 3 weeks\".\n2. \"3 weeks\" is defined in terms of 7 days. The question implies that she goes to school every weekday, so that makes Monday-Friday the week. Therefore, the total number of days during 3 weeks should be 21.\n3. During these 21 days, Emma buys milk each day so it takes a total of 21 days to buy 2 containers.\n4. So, if Emma buys one container of milk each day during the weekdays, this means that she buys 2 containers during the weekdays.\n5.

That's important since it means Andy's remaining supply of tomatoes can't be represented as exactly 126 - 0 or 126 - n, where n is a certain number instead of the unknown quantity \"tomatoes remaining\". That's because of Andy's plan of harvesting plants in order and Andy's preference to harvest every tomato on a plant.

We know that the granddaughtre's mother is younger than she is, because Betty is older than her granddaugher.\n6. We conclude that Betty's age (mother of the granddaughtter) is 100 - [20/40] = 60 years old. So the mother of the granddaugther  is 60 years + X years = 60 years * (1 + [1/3]) * [1 - [1/40]] = 60 years + 20 years * [11/12] = 60 + 17.143... = 77, or, we can round it up to 80.\n7.

However, some of the hydrogen in crude oil is organically bound to hydrocarbons and cannot be separated into the hydrogen-rich fraction.\n\nCruse oil can be divided into many categories but the most important factors used to classify crude are: API Gravity, Density Gravity and Sulfur content.\n\nAPI gravity is a measure of the density (or lightness) of the petroleum. Crude oil has a lighter density than water, so the higher the API gravity number (for oil), the lighter the oil. It is the measure of the degree of lighter of the crude. Crude oil is categorized by API Gravity into three broad grades: Light, Medium, and Heavy. Each grade of crude oil is separated and stored to produce transportation and petroleum refinement for other products.\n\nDensity gravity of crude oil is the measure of the lightness or heaviness of the crude when it is at 60F. Crude oil densities range from 39.600 lb/gal (39.6 SG) to 73.500 lb/gal; therefore, it is categorized into densities: sweet (higher density or less light than water), intermediate or heavy (less density than water; these fractions are known as low specific gravity and high specific gravity).\n\nSulfur is an element found in petroleum that causes an aromatic and non-safety concerns of petroleum products. This causes negative health impact on individuals which consumes these products.\n\nDifferent categories are created for sulfur content and they can be divided into three (3) categories: low, medium and high.

Overall 3 sets in total. 3 x 40= 120 pairs of laces has been handed out. \n\n### Alternative Solution\n\n### Rational: Each team has 10 skaters\n\n**Each skater has a pair.** Each skater is given 3 sets of lace to make it 120 pairs. \n\nAnswer: 120 pairs\n\n### Input : There are 2 teams playing a basketball game. Both teams have 21 members each. There are 4 basketballs in total. \nAll players on both teams will take turns to throw the balls into the hoop, not at the same time. The team who accumulates the most points after ten throws will win the game. The winner will receive a trophy worth \u20b950K and all players on the winning team will be awarded \u20b950 per point they score. If the team is 21 members, then 10 members of the team can take turns each throwing 1 ball, scoring a total of 210 points, and receiving a \u20b950K trophy and 5k each from the \u20b950 each point awarded. With each member of the team being awarded \u20b930k, the team will receive a total of \u20b9770k.\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Rationale:\n\n**Number of teams = Number of players = 21**\n\n**Since team 1 has the same number of players as team 2, players in team 1 will also take turns to throw the ball into the hoop.**\n\n**Each team's players will take turns to throw 1 ball**\n### Number of balls = Total number of throws = Number of players\n\nWe can see that the number of throws equals the total number of balls used in the game.\n\n**Since team1 and team 2 will collectively throw 2", "answer": " 240"}
{"text": "To figure this out, we can work out what my current age is by looking at the statement: \"In ten years, I will be _ years old.\" and subtracting 10 from this, we can deduce my current age. So using this, we can work out the answer.\n\nFor the first part, we know that when we add the ages of our brother after 10 years, we will obtain the sum of our ages. However, we are given that we are twice his age, which would mean if his age is A, my age is 2A, and therefore the sum is 2(A+A).\n\nThe second part asks us to find the sum of our ages after 10 years. If we assume our brothers age to be B, then the sum is 2B+2B.\n\nTo find my current age, we simply subtract the sum of the ages in 10 years, from the sum of my age plus my brother's age in ten years. So:\n\nA-2(B+B)=0+2B which reduces to 2B=A which then simplifies to B=A/2.\n\nSubstituting this, we get my current age as half of my brother's age because I am twice the age of my brother.\n\nThis brings us to the conclusion that I am half of my brothers age.

Assuming this inaccuracy and going with the scenario it implies: \n2. We can identify several things related to the question that are used to find the answer. \n3. The snowdrift was initially 34 inch deep. \n4. The first day had precipitation, causing it to be half-melted (6 inches). \n5. Then the second day had precipitation again, with a total thickness of 18 inches.\n6. Therefore 6 inches of 34 inches were the snowdrift's initial thickness +  6 inch of 34 inches that were removed as part of the melting effect, + another  18 inches of 34 (snowfall on second day on an already half-melt precipitation), resulting in 0.34 (6/18) * 34.\n\n\n### Input : What does D mean when you see D on a phone?

The difference would be $17 - $10. Since the difference is 7 more than the original amount, it would not make an equal different.

{"text": "Answer by rationales:\n\n1. Since the girls brought fewer popsicle stix than the boys, we will subtract the total number of sticks from the boys to arrive at the answer.\nWe would first subtract 15 from Ten (the number of sticks the First boy brought) to arrive at 5 and then subtract 15 from 15 to arrive at 0.\nWe would next subtract 15 from Twelve (the number of stix the Second girl brought) to arrive at -3 and then subtract 12 from 12 to arrive at - 2.\nWe would then continue taking away the total number of stix (15) from the stix the boys brought (15), in steps until we arrive at the total difference between the boys and the girls.\n2. In this context, \"fewer\" means that it is one fewer than the previous number. It is in reference to quantities in the context of counting things that are less than specific numbers.\n3. From the statement, \"fewer\" is relative to the number of sticks the boys brought and since there are many boys, there will be many more sticks. So we would be subtracting the number of sticks from whatever boys brought. Since \"few\" is relative to the whole group, it is possible that the group has more or fewer sticks.\n4. So, we would subtract 15 from the 15.\n5. Then, we would subtract 5 from the 5 since we subtracted the total number of straws that the First boy brought \nfrom the original number of Popsicle sticks the boy brought (15). \n6.

(It seems like Sarah has the answer but how did she get it?) Toads is plural so Sarah must have twice as many toads by counting the toads. Sarah counted 1, 2, 3,.. 30, then Jim, and finally Sarah. So Sarah had 30 then Jim, and last Sarah has 20. Sarah is now half way down (Jim is twice as much as Sarah). Sarah has 20 more because Jim has 50 (half way between 30 and 50) \nSo from Jim, Sarah has 50 and that is twice as much as Jim. Sarah has 50/2 more (since Jim has 50) so Sarah has 25. That is Sarah's toads. (10, 20, 30,.. 30..50,..60.. 20 (half way), Sarah has 30 and Jim has 50). Sarah has 50 more than Jim has. Sarah is half way between Jim and 50. Then Sarah has 50. Sarah now has half of Jim's total. If you count down from 60 to 20 and have 25 (30) then Sarah has that many toads.

If 290 day lilies would be enough, how many tulips would the owner use if 330 flowers would be enough?\n\n### Demostrate & Rationalise:\nFor this task first divide total number of flower by amount of tulips. Here 330/290 is 1.15238095238. Which is less than 1. Let the amount of tulips needed is 1 so the amount of day lilies needed is 0.8*(330-290)=40/330.\n\nNow if the amount of day lilsies added is 1 less the number we found then for that we need 2 tulips. If day lilies added is 1 more than the number we found, for that we need 1 tulips. It is so by taking the absolute value of 1.66. It is also to be noted that here all calculations are in multiples of 1 flower.\n\n### Input answer: Option D is the correct answer.\n\nInput answer:\n\nThe amount of tulips is the same as the amount of day lillies i.e. 0.8*(290+130)/330*0.8=295/330. But here the amount of the day lillies not added is 290. So the amount of the daylilly to be used should be 295-(290=5. Therefore, Option D is the correct choice.\n\n### D&R answer\nInput: Which statement is true? 1) The square of an even number is odd. 2) The sum of an even integer and an odd integer is odd. 3) The square of an odd number is even.  4) The sum of an odd integer and an even integer is odd.\n\n### Demo:\nAssumption is based on the properties of integers i.e. property of being ODD OR EVEN.\nThe question states which statement is true.

However, it is safe to assume based on the question that each act is 15 minutes.\n\nThe main method for answering the question correctly is to use the formula for consecutive intervals by addition and to solve for the number of groups, \"g\". \n\nConsecutive intervals by addition: The total time required for the entire set of groups of actors is by multiplying all the times in total together:\n\n### Maths:\n\n15min * 5/g = 60min (min for each block)\n\n60min * 5/j = 60min * 4 = 240min\n\n240min * 5 = 1200min\n\nSince we subtracted off the individual group times from each consecutive interval times, we end up with the total minutes actors on the show in 60 minutes in 1.4 groups:\n\n1.4g = 60 min\n\ng = \u221b(3600/60) = 6 \n\nTherefore, there can be 6 groups of 5 actors in a show. This makes sense because 6 groups would have about a 10 minute gap between each group as the actors switch off, which is 10/5 * 5 min or 25 min.

To do this, I thought about the information and found that in the prompt, Ittymangnarks has already caught enough fish for 3 servings for himself so obviously the remaining two servings went to Oomyapeck and the fish was divided again by the dog and Oomyapeck who gives an eye to the dog and eats the remaining piece of fish.\n4.

We can calculate the number of the other vegetables similar to how we calculated the number of potatoes.\n\nFrom the question we know that the garden produced 238 potatoe, but 60 fewer cukes that's 238 - 60 = 168.\n\nThat 168 cukes is twice as many as 168 potatoe. Therefor, the number of cukes is 168 x 2 = 336.\n\nThat 336 cukes is the same as 238 plus 336 potatoe.

So if one gets this one right it should cost 4.50+9.50 so that makes $14.\nSince Henry took 9 pins and 4 pills cost him 1.50 and then the other 9 pins is $ 5.50 as 9 x $5.50 = 48.5 then the grand total is his $4.50 and 48.5 so that means $14.50. The answer here is $5.50 so that's how it is. But if it were 5.50 it makes more sense than 9.50 then it is $14. And then add the $4.50 to it makes $18.50 because you get Henry took 9 pats and 4 pins is $4.50 9 x $5 is $48.\nTotal sum of the answer is $4.5 + 48.5 $5.5 $ 159.5\n\n### Input :You paid for an item which costs 105.50. In that case how much should you pay so that you do have the exact change in your pocket and not a single cent?\n\n### Answer : $100\n\n### Demostration :\nIn order to have your change in the correct amount, you first subtract $100, which is your entire payment. \nNow, this leaves you with a difference of $5.50. You need to add $5.50 to this amount to get the total cost.\n\n$105.5-100=$5.5\n\nNow, you must add 5.50 to get change in your pocket.\n\n$0+5.50=$5.50\n\nTherefore, the amount you must pay in order to", "answer": " 41"}

{"text": "The answer to this math question is C: 16 ft\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. Since the second ball is three times bigger than the first ball, it would likely require three times more yarn than what is required to create the first ball. 16 feet of yarn is 3 times of that of the first ball. \n2. This assumes that the same quantity of yarn is being used to create each ball, which is the basis of this math question. \n3. Further, if three times the number of feet for ball one is required for ball two, this means that the third ball, which is 3 times bigger than the first two balls, would require 9 times the amount of yarn. The fact that 9 times the amount is used for the third ball implies that 3 times the amount of yamr would be needed for the second ball. \n4. In other words: we use 3 times the amount for ball two and 9 times the amount for ball three, the answer would be 16 feet for ball two. \n5. The amount required to create the third ball implies that the second ball must be three times bigger than this first ball. So it'd be logical to assume that 16 feet of this yarn would be used for the second ball, which is the best answer among the available options. \n6. Since we have successfully solved this math question, we can restate the process used to solve this:\n1. First: We determine the given relationship in the question: Balls 1 and 2 are directly proportional but balls 2 and 3 are inverse proportional.\n2. Second: We determine the quantity of yarns needed to create various balls, given that the dimensions of balls 1, 2, and 3 are related by ratios.\n3. Third: We determine the number of feet equivalent to the given quantity of yarn by dividing the number of yards by 36. \n4. And finally, we find that the number of feet of yarn used in the second ball is 16 ft", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "The answer is 28 sticks of wax.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\nTo answer this task, we need to apply a mathematical formula for solving the question using the given information.\n\nFirst, we have to work out the volume of wax needed to make a large animal. The volume of wax needed for a large animal is the sum of the volume of wax for the four sticks given to each large animal.\n\nLarge animals take four stakes of wax, each containing 25 cm3 of wax. Thus, the total volume of wax required to make a large wax animal is 100 cm3. \n\nThe number of large animals that Loraine made was equal to three times the number of small animals that she made. Therefore, the question can be rephrased like this:\n\n\"What is the volume of wax Loraine needed to make the large animals?\"\n\nAnswer: 100 x 3 = 300 cm3.\n\nThe total volume of wax Laraine used to make all the animals is 300 cm. Since the volume of wax required for a small animal is half the volume for a large animal, we can equate the number of large animals to the number of small animals.\n\nAnswer: 300/2 cm = 150 cm.\n\nNext, we work out how much of the volume of waxy that Loraine used to make both small and large animals.\n\nLoraine used 12 stakes of wax to make the small animals and 150 cm of wax to make all animals. In this case, she used 162 stakes in all. \n\nThe total volume that was used to make animals was 662 cm. Since the volume for small animals and large animals is equal to the volume of all animals, we can then subtract the portion of the amount of wax used for small animals from the volume required to make all animals. \n\nAnswer: 662 - 120 = 542.\n\nThe answer is 542 stakes of waxy.\n\n### Source: https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/math-1352, https://open.umn..edu/opentext", "answer": " 20"}

C: carnations: If 'Carnations' refers to 'previous sentence' rather than 'input', it doesn't make sense as we haven't been told that the 'previous sentence' is about a bouquet. As flowers are generally combined in a bouquet, it makes sense that it would have multiple words in it rather than just one word, like 'Carnations'.\n4. D: carnations: Just like 'carnations' in 'C: carnations', this sounds too specific. We shouldn't have to repeat the same word that was used in the previous sentence 2 times.\n5.

We know that the two gyms have a different membership charges, however, we do not know whether the difference in membership charges include the different gym fees.

Based on the information:\n\n\"The cheap one costs $110 per year, and has a sign up fee of $50.\"\n\"The second one is $40 a month, and has a sign-on fee of four months.\"\n\nWe can get the annual membership fees of the two gyms:\n\n1.

Choices: 1.A: sports car\n2.B: truck\n3.C: luxury car\n4.D: compact car\n5.E: midsize car \nRationales:\n\n1.  While it is possible for a sports car to have a high amount of miles, we are assuming that the question refers to the condition of the car rather than the value of the car. As such, the sports car is less likely than other cars described. Additionally, the given mileage being 113, 000 is fairly low for a sports car, which would imply that this car would be used as a daily driver, and sports cars are typically driven for leisure. The \nsecond car described, truck, is not an option here because that is not the type of vehicle that would be used as a day-to-day car.\n\n2. The midsize car fits the information provided. It is more likely than the compact car, as 113,200 miles seems like a high amount of mileage for a compact car, as these typically have mileage below 100k, in comparison to midsize cars that can have up to 200k. While it is possible for the fourth choice in the choices, luxury car, to be more appropriate, we can assume that this car was used as a daily driver based on the mileage given, thus it is more likely that it was considered a 'compact car' by the statement given.\n \n3. The compact car is the best fit. Compact cars, in comparison to mid-size cars, are designed to be used as daily drivers and should have low miles because of this.

{"text": "37.5\nWe can calculate the total minutes to wash everything by setting up a three-columned times table. The total number of minutes would be '1' - the number of minutes it takes to wash everything. We can fill the three columns with the times it takes to wash each type. First, the total number of minutes it takes is 16 minutes, the total times the type of wash is done is 7 and the types of wash are 'clothes','sheets' and 'towels'. Using the given clues we can start calculating how long it will take. The time it takes for the piles of clothes to wash is 15 x 30 minutes, which makes the total of 450 minutes. Next, for the pile of towels is 1 x 60 minutes, then 200 minutes. Finally, for the piles of sheets; 13 x 45 minutes, 57.5 minutes. So, the total times are; 450, 200, and 57.50 for the types 'clothes',\n'towels' and'sheets'. Using addition and subtraction we can sum up all these times. So, the total time is 450 + 200 + 57.5 which equals 707.5, which is less than 24 hours, which would mean that less than 24 minutes has passed and Naomi is still washing her things. Therefore, the number of minutes it will take to wash everything was exactly 1 which means that there is only 15 minutes left to wash everything. As there are a few minutes left in these 15 minutes then it will still be less than 3 hours to wash everything. So, the number of minutes was 35 hours, which is equivalent to 37.5 minutes.\n\n### Input:`You are playing the computer game, \"The Mighty Thumper\".

His brother shoots four long-shots, so he scores (10 points). Let us say, X is the points Reggie loses by.\n\n1. We know that his brother scored 10 points which means his shot is less by 10 points(since he lost points to Reggie).\n2. Let us say R=10 which means, Reggie's shots were more by R points. i.e. R>=0.\n3. Taking R!=0, R = 10. The points scored by each of them becomes R+P which means P should be -10. So, his points is more by -10 and we now know this, which means P=>-10 (Reggie lost by - 10 points).\n\nQ1:What must P < 3?\nA: P<=2, since Reggie scored 3 lay-ups.\n\nQ2: How many points must Reggie lost by to make the sum of their scores the same?\nWe know that both of them scored 20 points, which means now, R+(-10) makes the score 20( since both scored the same and one has no points if he doesn't shot at all).\n\n### Discussion:\nWe know that Reggie lost by -10 points, meaning he lost 10 points to his brother and that is why he got total score 20 with his brother.\n\nBoth of them scored same but Reggie lost points to his brother, and since his brother is better, he lost points by more than the opponent and his points will always be lesser than his brother's. But both of them scored 3 lay-up shots. So, Reggie lost by minimum -9 (since R >= 0, R=10 and P>=0, meaning P<(-9)(11)).", "answer": " 2"}

It also requires the reader to have the necessary skills to interpret the question and determine what is being asked of them.\nBelow are a few ways in which responses can be written.\n1. Use an explanatory technique, which offers a more lengthy response in the form of an explanation that can help elaborate the reasoning behind certain steps.\n2. Use a simple technique, which is typically a shorter response that is written in a straightforward manner, without attempting to explain the reasoning behind certain aspects of the response.\n3. Use a visual aid, such as a diagram or chart, to summarise and illustrate important parts of the response which makes it simpler for the reader to comprehend the main points.\nThe example below should help guide a response writing task.\n\n### Example:\nThe question is:\nWhere would he take the toddler?\nWhat answer is given?\nHe takes the toddler to a hospital.\n\n### Explanatory technique:\nThe answer can be explained first by using a simple technique that answers the simple part of the question. \n> Simple technique answer: He takes the toddler home. \nThis simple technique addresses the simple portion of the question, but does not address the complex part of the question that requires an explanation. \nNext, an explanatory technique could be applied. \nThe following answer uses an explanatory strategy which is much longer but gives us a fuller explanation. \n> Explanatory technique explanation: \nHe takes the tottler to a hospital, it's just that hospital is too busy and the toddler gets angry.", "answer": " 1825"}

To calculate it manually, we can plug the numbers into the formula and get:\n\n`2+(4)+(6)+(8)=2+(4)+6+(9)=34(34\u00f74=8.5)`\n\nSo, the correct answer is 8.5.\n\n### Response:- Let's say we put all the numbers in an array, we can then call the following line of code to get the average:\n\n`// calculate the sum of all elements`\n`var sum = a.reduce((function (x, y) {\n    return x + y;\n});)`,\n\n`// calculate average`\n`var average = sum / a.length;`,\n\nand use the following line of code:\n\n`var result = average;`\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following question\n\n### Demolition: (to destroy)\n\n### Input\nDuring the demolition, they needed to pull down the building by hand. How long did that take?\n\n### Solution\nThe answer depends on how you define \"pull down the building\". If we assume that all workers were doing it simultaneously, then the answer would be:\n\n\\`\\`a*b=15 seconds\\`.\nIf, however, you assume that they worked in shifts, the answer would be: \n\\`\\`3*15=45 seconds\\`.\n\n### Testing\n- The first scenario is likely the one that actually happens since the entire group pulled down the building. \nThe second scenario is only likely to happen", "answer": " 60"}
{"text": "Choose from among the choices or write your answer under the blank.\n\n### Choice: The difference between the number of pieces of stationery Lorene have and the number of pieces of\nstationery Georgia have is 5 more times as many pieces than Georgia has.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe key to answering this question is to find out how many fewer pieces of stationary than Georgia has Lorene has.\n7. From the provided question:\n\nWe can easily see that Georgia has 25 pieces, while Lorene has three (3) times as many as Georgia, i.e. 75 pieces. \n8. So the sum of the stationary of both Georgia and Lorene is 100. In other words, Lorene has 75 pieces more than George does.\n9. But then how many fewer pieces of George does Lorene have?\n10. By rearranging the given statement, we have\n\nLorene \u2013 Georgia _ 3 (for three times more) = 75 (for the difference).\n\nSo the question can be rephrased as\n\nHow many fewer pieces of stationer than Georgia have Lorene?\n11. Here Lorene has 7 fewer pieces than George.\n12. To show proof for part c) Lorene has 7 less stationery than Georgia's.\n\nAnswer: Choice: The difference that Lorene has fewer pieces stationery than Georgia has is 7 more times as many pieces as Georgia has.\n\nNotation: $\\leftarrow$ _n_ $ times$ $ \\leftarrow $ _m_ for $ \\leftarrow $ (for a mathematical term, $ \\leftarrow $ )", "answer": " 50"}

Finally, one must decide on an appropriate way to express the answer.\nThere is also an additional benefit of asking students to write an explanation as well as to write the answer. Writing in this fashion helps reinforce their understanding of the problem. Finally, it gives them an opportunity to write in general, a skill that is essential in the work place, communication and future academic success. \n\n### Input\n\nTwo white socks cost $16.55.

So, let's assume that the water is flowing out of the tub at the same rate if this assumption does not hold true, then the length of time it takes to fill the tub will be very long, so we need to assume so to answer the question.\n\nWe have the following information and relations:\n\n-  120 liters / minute flow rate of the tap\n-  12 liters / minute flow through the cap\n-  1 minute / water is run for\n-  1 minute = open water and 1 minute = closed water supply\n\nSo, we have the following information and relation:\n\n-   1 minute = 12 liters\n\nWith the above information, we can use all the information and relation from the question to solve for the answer:\n\n120 liters - 12 liters = 108 liters per minute\n\nIf we plug 108 litres per minute into the 1 minute = 108 relation of the question, we get the answer: 108 minutes.\n\n### Conclusion: I hope this helps!\n\n### Resources: https://www.freecodecamp.org/\n### Thanks for reading.", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "The area of the rectangle will be `r` on a perimeter basis, where `r = 100`. Since the length and width are equal, the length will be twice the width, or `2w`. Therefore, the length of a rectangle will be `l = 4w`, where `l = 8w`. Rearranging, we get `w = \\frac{l}{4}`. The length of the rectangle will be `(4 w)^2` or `20w^2`. Rearranging again yields \"w^2 = 20l\" or \"w^2 = l^2/40\", or \"w = \\sqrt{l^2/40}\". Subbing in our numbers, we get w = 4, or the correct length is 8m.\n\n### Input The length of a rectangle is 11 more than 3 times its width. What is the area of the rectangle?\nRationales:\n### Response: The simplest way to find the area of the rectangle is to first figure out the dimensions that will maximize the area. Let's call the length of the rectangle l and the width w. The equation for area is A = lw.\n### If the width is x, the length will be l = 11 + 3x. The width is w = x + \\sqrt{(l^2-11)/3}\n### The area of interest is A = 3w(11 + 3w) = 3lw(11 +3w). Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to w, will yield 110 - 11w + 6w^2. Setting this to zero yields 3w^2 = 11 - 6w + 1, which is w^2 - 4w - \\sqrt{35}. Now, we'll substitute for l and w, yielding 11w^2 - lw - 3l - \\sqrt{36}W.

A total of 27 pounds of food is eaten by dogs and pups, but we need to know how much each dog eats to find out the correct answer. There are 8 times as many pups as dogs so the dogs only eat 27 pounds of the 35 pounds of food.\nThe question asked how much food the dogs and pups eat in one day. There are more dogs than pups in the camp. Dogs need to eat twice as much as puppies do. But pups have three meals in a day. Dogs eat one time the amount pups eat or 3 times as much. 10 + 15 + 20 + 27 (8X) = 35 (C).

We know that, otherwise, this would not make much sense in the context of the story of Mason)\n  - Mason has 16 cars (From \"For 40 days\", we know that 40 days is a relatively long time and that at least 2 cars need to be filled with the squirrels' nuts, considering that there are 10 squirrells)\n* We first consider the number of squirrels in the vehicles of Mason, we know that there are 16 cars, each with at least 2 squirrels. From that, we know that there must be at least 30 squirrels stockpiling nuts in Mason'd vehicles.\n* 30 * 1 squirrel / car = 30 cars full with 1 squirrel\n* We know that there are 300 squirrels, so we know that there must also be at least 10 squirrls not in cars, which means we add 10 cars to the 30 that were filled with 1 busy squirrel each. Now there are 40 cars, and each has at least 2 squirsts, so we must add an extra 20 since we know that there are busy squirrels.\n* 40 * 1 squirl / car = 40 cars full with 2 squirrel/car\n* The squirrels cannot be in the same car, so we have a total of 40+20 = 60 full cars.

If there are any other possibilities, the question would say 'if the building has 13 floors, how' instead of 'the number of floors in the building'.\n3. The number of floors left for the elevator to reach the bottom are calculated by subtracting the two directions of the elevator's course in the original statement, i.e. floors it descends from the top floor and floors it ascends from the second-last. \n\nInput:A room is 30ft wide, 20ft deep and 15ft high.

To find how long it will take for Joy to read 121 pages, we need to figure that out first.\n3. As the question describes that Joy can read 121 page in about 361720 minutes.\n4. 1 page ~= 14 minuets based on average number of words per a page.\n5. Therefore, it wokls out that it takes about 279.56 hours for Joy to read 8 pages of an 86 page book.\n6. She takes 279.6 minutes to read 8 pages, so she will need 313 hours to read 122 pages. \n7. This means it takes Joy (313 hours / 122 pages) X 1 page to read 12 pages is (475 minutes) X 1 page is 475 minutes.\n8.

Bobbie\u2019s last three letters are x, y, and z, and Samantha\u2019s have less x, y, z than Bobbie\u2019s does. If we know the number of each letter in Bobbie\u2019s last, we can get the number of letters in Samantha\u2019 s name. Thus there are [xx ] x, [yy ] y and [zz ] z in Bobbie\u2019 s last name.\n\nNext, we want to find the name with [xx ] letters (i.e. y letters fewer than x letters), which means that there is a y:x relationship between the letters in Bobbie\u2019s and Samantha\u2019 s last names.\n\nNow we know how long Samantha\u2019s name is, we can take that and double it to find the number of letters in Jamie\u2019s last if Jamie\u2019s [xx ] = 2y, and Jamie is in fact called Jamie Grey, then we can infer that there are 2y letters in Jamie\u2019 s last name and there are [11 ] letters in Jamie\u2019S last name.  \n\nOur working can look like this:\n\n**If Bobbie\u2019s last has x letters**\n**and Samantha\u2019s has y letters**\n**and Jamie\u2019s has z letters**\n**then Jamie\u2019s will have 2y letters**\n\n(Bobbie\u2019s last has 3x -y letters)\n**(Samantha\u2019s has 2y -z letters)**\n\nSince Bobbie\u2019s last 2y + z = 2y letters, and Samantha has x \u2013 2y \u2013 z = _ letters left.\n**Then, Jamie\u2019s has**\n\n(2y + z) \u00d7 2 = 4y + z\n**(x - 2y - z) \u00d7 2**\n\nWe know how many letter Jamie\u2019s has, we can divide [48 ] by 2, to get Jamie\u2019s last is 48 letters long\n\nSince Samantha\u2019 last name is [13 ] letters, we multiply the two (in our terms [22 ], and [13]))", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": "I. The amount of water needed on the desert island, which is 2 liters, will give 55.55 grams of salt. If we want an estimate to this amount, we can use the ratio of the volume of evaporated water and the weight of the salt that will be formed\n\n\n\nII. To find the evaporation amount of water we need to find the mass of salt. To do this we need to use the formula m_r=m_v/V\nwhere m_r will be the salt's mass and m_v will be the salt'se amount in weight. \nV=the amount of water in grams\nThe amount of water is 500ml x 0.2=1000ml. The mass of salt is m_r=m/V=1000/500=2\nTherefore 1ml of salt equals 2 mg.\n\n\n\nIII. Now to calculate the amount of salt, we have to find m_r by using the formula:\nm_r= m_v/V=((2000 x 500)/500) x 2=100\n\nIV. Answer: I was able to get the ratio for salt to water to be 1 part salt with 20 parts water. We know that 1 gram of water corresponds to 625 micro-g of sodium chloride.\n\n### Response 2: The first thing we can do is find that, if there were 20% salt content, 20 parts water of 100 parts water is 125 mg/l.\n\n\n\nNext we can do:\nm_r=(20)/(125)= 16.3%\n\n### Rationales:\n\nI. To find a proportionality between salt and water, we first calculate how many liters of water in the bucket, which is 2. So:\nV=2 x 2/2= 1 l\nThe proportion is 555/125. The evaporated quantity of water to each gram of salt is 555.\n\nII. When calculating m_r, we calculate how much of the total mass of water is salt. To do so we can use 3", "answer": " 400"}

{"text": "He can determine the total amount by first calculating the average of the averages. We will use the formula:\nLet n represent the number of students. $2(1/3) = 6/3 = 2\nLet p represent the number of students who received $2/day. 60 > p\nLet r represent the number of students that received $4/day. r < 60\nTherefore, we need p + r = 60, and p + r*(2/60) = 2.\n\nRearranging: r*(1/2) = 2. So we have 30(1/2) = ~1.5 r = ~6\n\nSo p + 6/3 - 2 = 1.5 > 0.  Therefore, p = ~ 45.\n\nHence:  $2p + 4r = 60 * 2 = 120\n\nLet T be the total amount of money per day. $2p + 2r = T. Therefore, $2p + 10/3 = T.\n\nSimplified further, $2p + T/3 = T so that p + (T/3) = T.\n\nPlugging p into the equation, we get: $5 + (T/3, which gives us: $5 + T/3 = 1*T.  So T is equal to 45. Hence, T = 45 and the money that the students receive in a day is equal to 415.

{"text": "The number of members who attended the board meeting is 40.\n\n### Explanation:\nWe can simplify this question into two problems: counting the number of occupied chairs; and finding total possible seatings per chair.\n\nThe total seating per each chair is 2, i.e. 2 chairs per 1 person. So, to find the total number of seats for the meeting, we can add each of the 40 chairs together to get 40 x 2 = 80. Now, we want to know how many of all available seats were used from 80 total. The total available seats for the meeting are 100% of 80 because the available seats are all the 40 chaires. There's a total of 16 (40 x 2) places that can accommodate 2 people each, and in order to accommodate that many people, the available seats are only all 40 chairs. Therefore, the total seats used from all possible 16 (4 x 2 chairs each) seats is 80. We can express this as 80 / (4 x 2) == 100%, and can be simplified to 80 / 8 = 10 or 50%.\n\nSo, 2/5 of seats were used. There are a total of 2 seats left out of 8, which is two of out eight seats available (2/8). Now, each seat has 2 seats. We are comparing two seats to 8. And, 2 of 8 is equal to two out of twenty four, which is 1 in 24, or 4%, and not 50%. 50% means all seats are used and all four seats are missing.

Since she delivers 27 meals in total, this means she receives 8% of the 27 = 2.18 meal deliveries.\n\n### Input:[Sydney Australia] Alicia said she got the newest iPhone. I said it was older than that. She said the iPhone was first released. If it was first released, why would she have a new one?\n\n### Demostration:\nIf it was first released, she would not have a new one. Since it was first released, the question must be one of the other choice which means the newest. The oldest release date was June 29, 2007. The most recent release date was September 12, 2019.

He paid a total of $21.00, and wanted to know how much change he would receive back if he paid with a $ 50 bill.\n\n**Strategy:**\nIn order to determine the question, I would have to figure out what Simon's total bill was and find the least amount of money to pay it off. Once I pay the total amount in cash, I would have to receive change, since I already paid for  the amount of money needed for a $50 bill to cover the total cost. Therefore, the question is asking how much change I will receive.\n\n**Answer: Simon will receive $4.83 in change.**\n\n**Question breakdown:**\nLet's first find Simon's total bill. \nTotal Bill = $ 21.00 - ( $21.0 - $50)\n\nThe answer after calculating the total bill comes out to $4.83.

{"text": "$92.50\n\n### Rationale: 1. Since both Lisa and Carly spent half of Lisa's total t-shirt cost, both will get $20. \n\n2. Since Carly spent $20, she spent 3 times her amount on jeans. Therefore, Carly spent $60 on jeans.\n\n3. Given that $60 is divided by 4, the result is $15. \n\n4. Because Carly spent $15 on t-shirth, we can determine that Carly spent $182.50 in total\n\n5. Including Lisa's total cost, the result is $92.5.\n\n### Rationales: 1) We know Lisa spent $40 on tshirts\n\n2) Half of $40 is $20\n\n3) Lisa is buying jeans and Carly spends $20, so it makes sense Carly is buying jeans\n\n4) Since they both spent $40 on jeans, this means Lisa and Carly each bought the same amount\n\n5) Given Lisa costs $40 and she is buying twice as much as Carly (coats), it means Lisa is buying $80 on coats which in conjunction with the previous point (Lisa buys twice as much as Carley) makes sense as they spent $80 together\n\n6) Since Carly spent $40 on coats also, Carly spent $48\n\n7) Carly spends $48 on tshirts which means she spends $48 - $20 which is $28\n\n8) From $70, you can split it 4 times to get each $17,5. \n\n9) The sum of $92.5 can be achieved by adding Lisa's $40 and the total for Carly ($17,5+18,25)\n\n\n### Output\n\n### Instructions: Write a response that appropriated completes the request.

{"text": "110 minutes\n\n### Rationales:\n1. First of all, we are given information that Rosie runs 6 miles/hour, which tells us that she can run for 100 minutes, which is the equivalent to 6 miles. This information can help us to know that she runs for 100 mins and 50 mins for 2 days every week.\n2. Then, we are given information of how much Rosie runs for 5 days, which are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Since we can\u2019t tell the distance Rosie has reached using the info that we\u2019re been given, we try to make some guesses.\n3. To make a quick guess, let\u2019s assume Rosie can run for 2 hours on Monday, which can guarantee us a result of roughly 3 miles. However, we still need to adjust the result so that we can get exactly 30 minutes. To do this, I have decided to take 60 mins to divide by 2, which gives us 30 mins and the remainder of 30 mins, 30 \u2013 30mins = 0, which means we can eliminate the result of 120 mins.\n4. Since now we have already eliminated one part of the equation, let\u2019s take 50 mins to divide in 2, which gives a result of 25 mins. However we need to adjust this result, so we again set the remainder equal to 30 mins.\n5. To find the remainder part of the equation, we subtract the numbers, 60mins \u2013 25 mins = 35 mins, which is exactly the same as 35 mins \u2013 35 mins = 0 mins.\n6. At this point, we now have 2 results \u2013 25 mrs run on Monday and 35 mins run on Tuesday. \n\n11/2 mins = 1/6 days\nWe need to subtract 2 from the result because Rosie runs on Mondays and Tuesdays, therefore 2-2=0, which means that we can eliminate that result.\n7.

Building - E to get a haircut.\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nFor the program, Sam should use his ticket to enter the building. The first choice 'to check his luggage' is for an aircraft. We can ignore it. The second choice is 'to rent an apartment'. We can leave it because'renting an apartment' doesn't make sense when we take into account the requirement that 'Sam must enter a theatre.' The third choice 'to get onto a train'. We can also ignore it. The last 2 choices are 'board trip' and 'get a haircut', so we choose 'board trip' because it is the most applicable answer.\n\nAfter that, we consider where we have to enter a theatre. We need to enter a building and then enter a building does not mean to rent an apartment. It means to enter a museum. Finally, we choose 'to enter a museum' as the answer, 'to get a haircut'. \n\n\n### Example of the 5th question:\n\n### Instructiuion: Answer the following", "answer": " 360"}

There is one space between numbers and letters and the number will always be larger than the letter following. Example: 16 ___ Q\n\n### Rationales: Choice: code A Choice: code B Choice: code C Choice: code D Choice: code E\n\n### Rationale: 1. The question is asking how many times Jack's current number (current space) of apples can fit in Jill's basket.  It is implied that Jill has fewer apples, and Jack has more. We know that Jack's basket is currently full with 12 apples and has room for 4 more. We know that Jill's basket has twice as much space.  It is also assumed that apples may be able to fit in both baskets, in their appropriate space, so that they don't spill out.\n\n2. There are 2 spaces in Jill's as well as Jack's basket and to determine the answer, we will look at what number of apples in Jack's basket can fit in 1 of the spaces. By 1 of the spaces, we mean 1/2 of it, because 1 space is shared by the two baskets.\n3. According to the question, Jack's basket is at its fullest when it has 1 apple less than 2 full spaces in the basket. This means that we need to calculate what number of apples can fit into 1 of the two spaces. Because we know that Jack's space for apples is either full, or short of 1 apple and it can hold 4 apples, we can calculate the number of apples in 1 space.\n4. If we assume that a space can hold 2 apples, we get 2 as the answer. 2 apples may not always fit, but there's enough room.\n5. However, the question does not state that the number of apples will always fit in 1 space, but simply asks how many times. 4 apples can fit in 2 baskets. So by removing 1 apple from the basket, we can say that 4 apples still fit in the basket.\n\n6. But what if the answer is 5?", "answer": " 3"}

It is known not only by hockey players but also by many people. Moreover we need to find what is meaning of 'face off' on the puck. This should be not difficult: the process of starting a game in which two teams of eight players each skate at each other up and down a sheet of ice and attempt to throw a rubber disc between their legs to their opponent while skating.\nThen after we understand the definition of face off on the puck we need to understand the new rule and its effects. This means we need to know which teams will gain benefit from new rule.\nSo we should answer yes to the question by choosing A: only in playoff but no if we do not have enough information (D: only in Stanley Cup games or E: never).

{"text": "The answer is 8\n#### Demonstration: \nInput:The total number of boys on the minibus was 18. Now if we consider all the boys, we have 8 of them on the bus. This means that 8 boys were on the bus. Now if the number of girls on the bus was the same as the boys, then there were 8 more girls on the bus. This results in the total number of girls on the minibus being 16. But we were told that the total number of girls and boys on the bus was the  same. Thus 2 fewer girls than boys were on the bus which is our answer.\n\n#### Demonstrated answer:\nLet's find the number of girls and the number of boys not on the minibus. We know that the number of girls is `8+16 = 24` which leaves us with `24 - 8 = 16` girls that didn't join the field trip. We also know that the number boys on the minibus is `8`. The total number of not-on-the-bus is `8 + 16 = 25` boys, which indicates that `2+5 = 7` fewer boys are not on the minibus than girls. Our answer is `25 - 8 = 7` boys.\n\n#### Demostration Answer for the number of boys and girls on the bus:\nLet's calculate how many boys and girls were on the minibus.

{"text": "Barnyard owls makes 5 hoot sound per minute. Hoot sounds in a minute is 5 because no hoot sounds from owl takes less than a minute. Owls in the barnyard don't make any hoot sounds for 5 minutes. So, there is less than 5 minutes for 20 hoots since no owl makes any hoot for less than a minute. To know the 20 hoots in 5 less than 5 minutes means to know what is the no. of hoots they were making per minute. 20 hoot sounds = 20/5 hoots sounds = 4 hoots sounds in minute. Hence, there are 4 barnyard owls in the noisy barn making 5 hoot sounds.\n\nAnswer: The question states that, if five less than twenty hoots per minute are in all out from the barn, then how many barnyard owls are there?\n\nLet us begin by considering the number of barnyard owls that make five hoots per minute. So, there are fifty hoots per hour by one barnyard owl. \nHence, there are also 550 hoots per hour since 5 less than 40 hoots per minute is made by the owl.\n\nTherefore, if we take 5 less than the total number of hoots per minute given the number of owls that make the hoots per minute, then there are 550 hoot sounds in an hour.\nNow, we assume that each of these hoots last for one minute.\n\nSo, we use up 550 hoos per hour in one minute.\n\nFor twenty minutes, it is possible to have 11,000 hoots. \n\nNow, we assume the noise is caused by 550 hoops per hour in a minute.\n\nTherefore for 20 minutes, it is possible having 11,040 hoots.\n\nSo there are 551 hoots per hour for 20 minutes.\n\nSo, for twenty minutes, there are 11,080 hoots.\nFor 20 less than twenty minutes, it means we subtract 20 from 20 minutes.

{"text": "She would have 18 minutes left. To see her work, scroll down \n\n### Rationale:\nShe used 12 minutes so far. There's 58 more questions so there are 46 more minutes. Since she answered 23 questions in 12 minutes, she would need to answer 23 more questions in 34 minutes, or at an average of 48 seconds per answer (46/23*48 = 4)\n\n### Rationales:\n1. When considering the given information and logic, it is easy enough to calculate how many questions remain by dividing 62 into 80 if you consider the total number of questions to be 62, instead of 80 as given in the question.\n2. Then we can divide these answers by the given answers.\n\n\\[x = 62 \\div 23\\]\n\\[e = \\frac{48}{4.8}\\]\n\n### Rations:\n3. However, these answers are off.\n\n### Ratiocination:\n4. To determine why these values do not match, let us consider the context of the data.\n\n### Input 1: Jessica has answered 16 of 80 questions so far. According to the context given (that her pace so far was 48 seconds per question), we cannot assume that each answer she gave contained 48 seconds. This means there is no logical way to derive an answer which uses this information. Given this information, our only option is to simply compare the total number of unanswered questions (58) to the time Jessica has used so far, and compare it to the total number of questions (62).\n\n5. The answer is that she has used 18 minutes as she has used 12 of the 62 questions for a total of 12/60 questions that have been answered to her remaining 50 questions that can be answered in an additional 48 minutes. \n6.

There are other choices available but the border collie can only reach the ball with a certain speed. \nFrom Belinda's description, we know that it will take Belinda eight seconds to throw and reach the ball.\nBelinda's speed is not that high so the border collie will need to catch up in less than 5 minutes to avoid it being out of reach when Belinda reaches it. So, that leaves us with at most eight options for the border collie catching up to the ball. So, the total is 5*8=40 seconds which is less than two minutes. \nHowever, since the time is counted out in seconds and not minutes, we can conclude that the answer ranges from 1 to 41 seconds inclusive.\n\n\n### Instructions:Write an instruction for the above problem and have a demonstration.\n\n### A problem on the number of words in a phrase.\n\n### Input A phrase with at least 3 words: Choices:  A. less than 6 B. less than 10 C. between 8 and 12 D. between 12 and 14 E. between 16 and 90\n\n### Demostration: 8\n\n### Procedure: Input at least 3 words.

In mathematics, regular polygon means the generalization of triangles in which all sides and angles are equal. We can call this the base length of our regular triangle \"x.\"\n\n### 2. The base length of Zion\u2019s friend's house will be half of \"x.\" We can call this base length of our regular triangles that is inscribed inside their friend's house \"y.\"\n\n### Let us assume that there are two houses in the first group: A and B. Now we will determine the total area of the two houses \"A\" and \"B\".\n\n### 3. First we will determine the base length of Regular Triangle A. The base length of Regular triangle A would be x/2 cm and the height would be y/2 cm.\n\n### Thus, the area of regular triangle A would be 1/2 * x / 2 * y / 2 = 1/4 * x * y / 4 = x/2 * y / 4 cm.\n\n## \nSo, the area of regular triangles A and B together would be  1/4 * x / 2*y / 4 + 1/4 * y/2 * x/4 = (1/4 * x*y / 4) + (1/4 * y*x / 4) = 1/2 * (x*y / 4).\n\n### Concluding, the total area of the first two houses that Zion built would be 1/4 * (x/2 * y/2).  \n\n### Note: if we make all these assumptions we can solve this problem. \n\n## \n## \n### 4. In the next two steps, we will determine the base lengths for the remaining two houses. Let us call the base length of house C \"c\" and the base length of house D \"d\".", "answer": " 1200"}

There were 25 candies of another particular colour (yellow).\n    3. There were 20 candies of yet another particular colour (blue).\n\nDemonstration:\n    1. From the given information, we can easily determine there were 10 candies of the third particular colour (blue). (20 less than 3 times as many yellow candles as red candles)\n    2. If Carlos ate all the yellow candies, then all the red candies remain.\n        1. If two thirds of the remaining red candies were yellow candies, then there were 75 candies after Carlos ate the yellow candies.\n        2. After subtracting 10 blue candies from there are, we can conclude there are 65 left. \n        3.

{"text": "First, we need to determine the lengths that he threw the javelins.\nThe question states, In the last Olympics, [Javier] threw the javelin [three] times. The [first] throw, he threw the [javelin] twice as far as he [threw the javelin] on his second throw, [with] only [half as far as] he [threw it] the third throw. If [the sum of all three throws] was 105cm, then [how far, in meters,] did he [throw the javelin]on his first [throw]?\nTherefore, based on these instructions the only answer options for the lengths of each throw are 2x 575cm + 0.5 x 575cm (the sum is 586.46cm, which is 100cm less than the given answer) and 2x 650cm + 0.x 1130cm (the sum is over 1800cm, which is more than 100cm too long.)  Therefore, our options 2x 586.56cm or 1x 650 cm need to be eliminated. \n\n### Rationale:When we determine that our options must be 2x 625cm + 0x 1135cm, there are two methods we can use determine the answer.\n\n### One can use logic to eliminate the options.\nThe correct answer needs to be 670.133 cm.

Thus, these choices cannot be the right answer.\n\n## Rationale:\nThe other method of determining the answer is through algebra.\n\n### Algebraic Method\nFirst we multiply the first x by 625cm then -0.5 x by 2 and then x by 886.59cm.\nThen, we add all the terms together and subtract 487.1053 to get the final answer of 4", "answer": " 300"}

{"text": "In order to make the rope, Tony will tie the ropes together. The problem is that one knot makes a rope shorter by 1.2 ft. This means that he will need to rewind if the rope is too short to tie knot. How to start determining the answer is to examine the available size of each rope.\n\nFirst, the question specifies that there are 8-foot ropes. There are also 3 2-foot ropes and a 7-ft rope given the length of its rope, Tony will only be able to use those ropes, he cannot use the 20-ft rope as it will be too long.\n\nThe next step is to start calculating the lengths without taking into the other information about the ropes. From the start, we know that there are 8ft ropes. When we sum them up, the result will be 24ft. If we add all the 2ft ropes, the answers will be 6ft. When we add the 2ft rope sum with the 24ft from a 8ft rope, it will be 22ft. When we add that 2ft rope again, the sum will be 20ft. So, what we know is that Tony will be using three 2ft ropes and one 8ft rope.\n\nIn order to tie them all together, Tony will need to make the rope into sections. We can determine the size of one section by adding the length of each 2-ft rope together. When adding two 8ft ropes is possible to do, but when it cannot, he needs to make a bigger section by combining two sections. If 2 sections is too small, he needs to combine 3 sections. In turn, that will make the length of the section equal 3 feet.\n\nThe final step is to determine how many ties there are. We need to know the number of ties in order to determine the length of the rope. The 8-ft rope needs 8 ties to make it 24 ft. Therefore, we know that that 8tie will happen twice in every 8ft rope section. Adding twice the number of ties is exactly 13 ties. The rest of the ties needed to combine the sections into one is 16.

{"text": "Since, we are just working with this single question and the number of piglets is known, you may just say the piglets all eat an equal number of sticks, which is an unambiguous statement for the last option. The question asks for how many straws each piglet ate and we're given the number of pigets and the number of straws eaten by each piglet. The answer is 20. To find the answer one must divide the number of sticks by the number of piglet. \n\n### Input-Answer: What is the solution for the given system?\n\nInput-A: 2x - 8 = 3\nInput-B: x - 2 = 4\nRationales: The answer is -1\n1. 2x-8=3; it means 2 times x is equal to 8 minus 3. In plain language it means 2 times 3 is equal to 8 subtracted 3 or 2 times 5.\n2. x-2=4: it means x is equal to 4 minus 2. In plain language it mean x is equal to 2 subtracting 4.\n3. In order to solve this you have to first add equations together or subtract equations together. 2x-4=2 or subtract both equation and get this 2x-2x=0 or 2x=0; you will have 2x is equal to 0. Now to solve this equation divide both side of the equation by 2 and get this x/2=0; this mean x=0.\n4. You have 2 equations with 1 variable so in order to find x you must solve for y. In order to do this the trick is to take your first equation then set it equal to your second equation. You get this, 2x-8=-3; x=3. Then to check you can say is this negative or is it posative; in order to do this you multiply and subtract 3. You get this, -3+-3=-8; thus x=-8. you get this, 2=-8; 2 times -4 is a negative number. To get the final answer you multiply by 2=-8; x=16. The answer is x=-16\n\n### Input and answer:\nInput:", "answer": " 6"}

There was no evidence to suggest how they were planning to divide the muffins.\n9. As per our rationales 1-4, we can safely conclude that the 40 muffin assumption may or may not be accurate.\n10. So, Jessie and her guests are still unknown and the 20 mffins is still too vague.\n11. In conclusion, the final answer remains to be...\n\n5.\n\n### Notes:\n1. In the following scenario, there is no 'Answer:'. Since there is no given solution or specific instructions, just an unlimited number of choices, there is no single solution that will work. There is no 'Answer'. It is just a list of valid choices.\n2. The question may be open-ended, meaning that it is only about gathering basic information or it may be closed-ended which means that the question may be either open-ended or closed-ended. If open-ended, then you are looking for your own answer.\n3. 'A': and 'D': must not provide options that are impossible", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "There are two possible options: D: 19 and E: Cannot be Determined. We'll have to answer based on whether these choices are the only options, or if it's a set of possible options.\n\nA: 100\n\nLet's determine an easy solution to determine the correct answer.\n\nWe know there are 110 an ants,  _ _ of them being female worker ants, and 50% are worker ants.\n\nThis tells us there are in total 240 worker ants. Since 20% are male worker ants, this leaves us with 190 male worker ants.\nHowever, this means it's not 50% male worker ants nor 50% female worker ants.\nThere have to be extra ants in there to make up for it.\n\nSo there's either 70 ants (50% of 135 male ants + extra 45 female workers) or 90 ants (45 extra male ants).\n\nLet's do one of them to solve the question:\n\n45 + 35 = 190 of the 240 or 80% of the 242 ants.\n\n70 additional male worker ants. \n\nTherefore, 190-70 = 120 female worker ants.   \n\nOur answer is: A: 190 ants.  \n\nHowever, if we assume that the question is actually an unspecified set of options, there's no way to know if female worker ants will overlap with 20% of worker population. So we could possibly answer  E: Cannot be Determanied to be the correct answer. \n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThere a few ways to tackle the task, and the conclusion depends on the specific options provided to be the answer to the question.", "answer": " 44"}

{"text": "$70, assuming she is paid only for the hours she actually spent.\n\n### Rationale: Given the following information:\n* Grace started her own landscaper\n* Grace charges $6 an hour to mow the lawn\n* Grace charges $11 an hour to pull the weeds\n* Grace charges $9 an hour to put down the mulch\n* Grace mowed 63 hours\n* Grace pulled the weeds 9 hours\n* Grace put down the mulch 10 hours\n* Grace earned $70 in total in September\n\nBased on the above information, Grace may be paid for working more than 8 hours per day.\nWe see that her earnings are not limited purely to the hours she physically worked. Instead, the income was based on the hours she worked on each task. For example, she earned $6 an hour for physically mowing lawn but $11 an hour for pulling the weeds.\nSince Grace is doing the majority of work for lawnmowing and pulling weeds, which both pay $6 an hour, she likely charges her own business an hourly rate for those two tasks. Thus, Grace made most of her earnings based on the time spent doing those two tasks.\n\nTo determine Grace's total earnings, we add up all the amounts she charges her business per hour for mowing and pulling weed, then multiply by the total number of hours she spent on each task. This means that we need to apply her hourly rate for each task to the total number of hours spent doing each task. \nThus, Grace mowed lawn for 63 hours and earned $6 a hour, pulling the weeds for 9 hour and charging $11 per hour, putting down the mulch for 1 hours and earning $9 an hour, adding up to $105 in total. To this $103 we then multiply by the number of hours she physically worked to get $70. Since many people get paid for 40 hours a week for their job which usually consists of about 20 hours of work, she likely makes $10 for doing these other jobs based on her hourly rate.  \nBased on the additional information given above we can get a fair estimate as to how much Grace actually earned without having to directly look at the total number of hours as the total", "answer": " 567"}

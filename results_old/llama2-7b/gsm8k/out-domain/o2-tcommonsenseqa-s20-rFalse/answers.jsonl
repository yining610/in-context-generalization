If she had done her shopping only at one shop she wouldn't need to pay $23 of it. The question had two parts: the payment the money before the next shopping and the amount of the credit need to pay. So I tried to calculate the difference between the amount of the credit used in the two days and her own payment, if I solved it I could know the credit need in the next shopping. The answer of the difference of the amount of the credit and the payment of the second day is $81, it is the correct answer, so I am happy and I know that I did really it.\n\n### Feedback:\n\nWhen I have more ideas to solve a calculus problem I like to use pen and paper to write an algorithm that is useful to keep the track and explain the choices and the rules.\n\n### Improvement:", "answer": " 62"}

If the Science Centre charges tax, each bag of marbles costs 36 cents more than a bag of buttons, and the tax rate is 10%. How much money does the Science Centre make on each bag of marbles?\n\n### Solution:This question is like the last question, we need to decide how much money each marble and button cost.\n\nThe marble costs $0.50 and the button costs $0.28. The tax adds another 0.56, the bag of marbles is $1.06 and each marble cost $0.05. The buttton bag cost $0.28 and each button cost $0.028.\n\n### Solution(2):The problem tells us to multiply $0.28 with 0.56 and the result is $0.16.\n\nThe tax is 16 cents and the other 94 cents is covered by the cost of the marbles.\n\n### Soliton(3):If you were to buy 35 marbles without the tax, how many marbles would you get for that price?\n\nThe same as before, we start with the cost of the marble. The cost of each marble is $0.26. We add 0.26 to $0.28 which is 0.54 which is the cost of a marble. Therefore if we buy 35 marble, the price will be 0.54 x 35 which is $18.60.", "answer": " 60"}

Note that it returns the index of the specified value (not necessarily the first time you enter it in the array) - the first time you put 3 in an array, it returns 0 and doesn't check for the second one. You then have to loop around the array to check if the next number is the same, but the function provides you with the index of that value, which is what you need in order to find 3 again.

{"text": "The answer is 10 pounds.\n\n### Reason: Harry has 4 blue weights. These weigh 2 pounds each, giving him 8 pounds total. Harry also has 5 green weights. These weigh each 3 pounds, giving him a total of 15 pounds. To get the total amount of weight Harry will have, add the pounds from the blue weights, and the pounds from the green weights. So Harry will have 23 pounds total. To get Harry's custom creation, divide the answer by two because they have to subtract the 2 lbs it weighs from the bar for the total amount of pounds of all his weights. So Harry's custom creation weighs 23/2=11 pounds with 2 pounds less than that of the actual weight of Harry's weight. Harry has 23 pounds total and subtract the bar's 2 pounds = Harry's custom creation is 21 pounds.", "answer": " 25"}

{"text": "Answer: John's speed is the quotient of his velocity when he is dragged by his dog. John's velocity is 6 miles per hour. But when John is alone, his velocity is 4 miles per hour. Since, John's velocity cannot go to zero, it has to approach zero when his dog is dragging him. Therefore, John's speed is 10 times the quotient of 6 (his velocity when the dog is dragging him) and 4 (his self velocity). His speed is equal to 1310 feet.\n\n**Note:** If the instructions are unclear, or don't make you feel confident, follow-up with the [support site](https://code.academy.com/questions).", "answer": " 5"}

Weight of the cow is 400 when it is purchased and there are two options:\n\n1) We increase the weight by 1.5 times\n\n400 * 1.5 = 600\n\nWhich then we take the price per pound, which is $3 and take the total cost, which will be 600 *  3 =  1800.\n\nOR\n\nWe can consider the cow weighs 70 before it was sold i.e.\n\n500 * 1 =  500\n\n$3 * 500 = 1500\n\nSo John will have two additional $1500.\n\n### Comments\n\nThe task description and response should be posted as answers, not as comments.

{"text": "I got the solution of the question 0.2.\n\n### Explanation:\nFor  to reach an answer we have firstly to express the number of meows through formulas.\nIn order to do so, I used the following formula for the first cat:\n\n\\[3cats * 3meows/hour =3meows/minute\\];\\\n\nwhere we use the convention that one cat has 3 meows per hour.\n\nAfter that, since is the second cat twice as frequent we have to multiply cats with 2 and multiply meows with 2. After that we get two formulas for one cat:\n\n\\(2cats * 3\\frac{meows}{minute} \\times 2 =\\frac{6meows}{minute}\\);\n\nand for the third cat is just like that:\n\n\\(cats * 3*(2\\frac{meows }{per minute} * 2) =6\\frac{meows/per minute}\\);\n\nNow, according to the question we have to sum all the meow that cats make in \n5 minutes. For that, we will multiply the 3 first cat by the first time, then by the second, and third, we will multiply the two by two first cat, then two by the second and the two first by two by the third, that will result in the final number.\n\nAfter that we sum all the meow per minute:\n\n\\[5\\frac{minutes * the number of meow of every cat}\\];\nTherefore, it is clear that the answer is 60.", "answer": " 55"}

We can say that 25/100 goldfish are at the service and the rest at the depth of the pond. If we multiply the part at the surface with 50%, the number of goldish at the service will be 25% of 50% or 5% of the goldish in the pond. So, the number of goldfish below the surface is 95% of the pond.

{"text": "Let N represent the amount of money that we take. We need to find the amount of money that Emily spends that she would have taken away, so multiply the amount she takes out of her salary by N. This can be done by subtracting 1,000 * N from 1,001,000 and taking the remainder. The remainder is $100,00 which equals $100, since $100 is less than the remainder, but greater than $0, so we can say $100 is taken out. Now we multiply $100 * N to get the amount of money Emily spends. The answer is $10,000.\n\n### Output:Let N(x) be our function, then we have the following properties:\n\n1. If $x=n, then $N(x)=n\n2. if $N(x) <= $y then $ N(y) >= $N(x)\n3. for any two $a $and $b, N(a)=N(b) implies a=b \n\n### Output Demonstration:To satisfy those relationships in the output section, we create an array with a function that takes as its first argument the value N, and takes 2 arguments, the first being the current value in the array and the second being its corresponding index.\n\n### Explanation:When given the function, we can use that with a for loop to increment the index to the next number after N. The function will then evaluate that number's index to return a new value(a-1).\n\n### Assignment:When running this output, make sure to pass in \"4\" for N.

The total is 70x miles for all the additional fuel needed. The plane travels 20x miles to refill the fuel with 5x of the plane crew, so the total refuel cost is 20x miles + 5x + 70x = 120x miles. The 30 passengers add up for 60x miles for the additional fuel, the total for all 35 passengers with bags equals 100x miles.

{"text": "The answer is 20. Let k1 be the age of Katie's daughter, k2 be that of Lavenia's son, and t be that of Lavenias daughter.\n\nk1 = (t + 2x) * (x - 2x/y) = t*(x - x/y) = t(x - 1)/y = t * (x - 1)/x = t*x/(x - 1) = (t*x)/(x - 1)\nAs the variables stay the same for the second formula, multiply by 2. (t*x)/x = 2(t*x)/(2 * x - 1);\n\nt*x/(x -1)/(x - 2x) = -1.

{"text": "In order to solve this problem, we must first understand the question. The question indicates that we must solve a mathematical problem with the following information: \n- Troy had 30/10 straws (100)\n- Troy fed an amount of straws to each type of pig (piglets and adult pigs)\n- The number of piglets was 20\n\nThe next step is to rephrase the problem by simplifying it into a mathematical expression. For the expression to represent the problem completely, the quantities should be divided between each other so that each quantity represents a specific set of pigs. In this case, the adult pigs do not have a number and the piglets have a number, so dividing the number of pigs will also give us 2/10 pigs on each side.\n\nThe question specifies that Troy fed 3/5 (3/5) (60) straws per kind of pig. So, in order to determine how many adult pigs got 60 straws, we must divide 60 by 3/5. Therefore, 60 divided by 3/5 or 30 straws were fed to the adult pigs. Next, we must take 60 divided by the total number of pigs which is 40. Therefore, we need to divide 60 by a number, which is 40 because we need to count by 10. The answer is 5.\n\nWe continue this process until each numerical value used for counting has been taken into consideration. So, in order that Troy could feed 20 piglet pigs, he needed to multiply 120 (20 x 6) divided by 2 pigs. Therefore, the correct answer is 60. However, to make the answer clearer after dividing the pigs by 2, we round it to 60. As a result, there were 60 straw in each piglet's mouth when Troy was done dividing the total amount of straws into 20 pigments each.\n\nThank you for your assistance.

{"text": "There are a total of 26 pink hats, 10 green hats, and 15 yellow hats. John removes a total of 10 pink hats, and John and Carl's total removed is 10. There are a total of only 16 yellow hats left because John only removes twice as many green hats as he takes away pink hats, but Carl does not remove any green hats. There are now 10 hats left.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nCarl adds 250, subtracts 38, and multiplies 6 to account for every green hat he takes away. 636, the number of hard hats left in the truck, is equal to 10 because the sum of every green hat was 2 + 6 = 8.  This is why John is taking away more hard hats than Carl is.\nCarl removes three green hard hats and two pink hard hats with a total of 5 hard hats left.  John, on the other hand, takes away one pink hard hat in addition to two green hard hats, giving him a total of 3 hard hats taken away.  Therefore, John has more hard hard hat removal than Carl and there are only 10 hard hats left in total to have a total of 16 remaining hats.\n\n### Challenge:\n\nFind all of the hard hats remaining after removing all of them.\n### Explanations:\nThis is the answer to the question:\n\nInput: There are 56 tacos.

{"text": "The height of the screen is 137 cm.\n\n### Reasoning:In the given question, the height of the screen is given as 137 cm, it is evident that the height of the screen exceeds 177 cm, and the perimeter of a square paper is also 20 cm shorter. Therefore the height of the screen must be less than 177 cm. The question asked for the height of the screen, therefore, after calculation it is evident that the screen height is less than 17.7 cm. If we make a calculation by using our knowledge that the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all four sides, then we must subtract the sides from each other, 20cm +20cm=40cm+40cm/2+40cm/4=40+20/2=40cm. Therefore, the perimeter is 20cm. If the height is 20cm, then the perimeter is not 137cm.\nBy solving the given question using the perimeter in a square paper of 20cm, it is evident that if the height of the screen does not exceed 177cm, then it cannot exceed the perimeter of a paper of 20 cm. Since the screen height is lesser than 17.65cm, the screen height is not 177 cm and the only option that is lesser than 20cm is 137cm, the given height of the screen.", "answer": " 100"}

{"text": "Kyle must make at least 105 origami stars to fill all the glass containers he bought to start. He can then buy 16 stars for each container and fill them up.\n\n### Input\nKyle purchased some paper and started crafting some cool stuff. This started as a 4x5  piece of paper for an origami star. He needed to fill his glass bottles however. He bought some pretty expensive glass bottles, but they look really nice. He purchased 2 glass bottles. Kyle then bought another 3 bottles that were exactly the same as the other 3. He needs to fill them all.\n\n### Response\nKyle wasted time and money crafting stars. He can make at least 4 stars with one square inch of paper. That is 15 stars for each square inch of paper he has. He has used 4x5 inches of paper for his star, meaning each paper can make 15 stars. He has to make 105 stars. At this rate it will take him much longer to get 326 stars, this is even after he buys more paper. His best bet is to buy more glass bottles as opposed to crafting more stars. He can buy 16 stars and fill each container, then if he has room crafts more stars. This method would also cut down crafting cost, only 9 stars would have to be purchased, after this though you must make room for the bottles, you still would need to make 107 stars, which is a waste of time and paper. Kyle does not need to keep making stars if he wastes all the paper to fill bottles.\n\n### Grading guidelines\n\n* Each task must be completed in a paragraph.\n* Complete the request.

The first thing I took away from this is the fact that it states \u201che loses 60 percent of them into the street.\" This states that you lose 60 percent of your items. I interpreted this to mean that you lost half of your marbles. After the question states \"he loses half down a drain\" but it then states that \"he has 20 left.\" Which means that he had 20 marbles remaining. Then 60 percent went down the drain, which leaves you with 10 marbles remaining.\n\n### Question:\nYou have $120 in the bank. You take away $72 leaving you with $48. You deposit $20, in the next 2 years you save $192 and take out $81. How much money do you have?\n\n### Answer:\nI first thought that this question was related to taxes and the fact that there is so much math being done, but I realized that the question is actually asking how much money the person has. For example, if the person had $120 and then took out $81; the amount of money that was taken out is higher than what was left, which means that the person had $39 and not the $120 that $192 dollars had been deposited into that over two years.\n\n### Input\nYou have seven identical pig shaped candies: one for each day of the week.

The first thing I thought was that you had them all already and that you were starting each day with the last day's candies. From what I understand, these pig-shaped candy candies were all at random but you only have seven days of them.

Limestone is a sedimentary rock that is made of the remnants of other sediment such as fish scales and crushed corals. The other 20 layers each contain a different type of rock. Let\u2019s say each of thos 20 layers contans two types of rock \u2014 some rocks appear to have formed at a different time than the other. Therefore, each of the remaining layers has 20 rocks. Two of the final 22 layered rocks must be limestone.\n 3. To calculate the number of rocks, 20 rocks must be added to the 5 limestones, and half (10 rocks) must be sandstone. The final number of limestones must be four, therefore 22 must be added to the sandstone, which adds up to 12 which must be quartz. To get 22, one more of quartz must be added, and eight which must be shale. The final number is 21, that makes 22. Because two of the 21 other rocks are limestone, 22 are the final number as the challenge describes.", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "Lizzie has 12 crayons.\n\n### Explanation:Let X represents the crayons that Lizzie has. From the second sentence, Bobbie has 3X = 3*12 = 36 crayons. And Billie has 12X = 12*18 = 216 crayons. So, 36/12 = 30/18 = 15 15/12 = 57/24 = 18 18/12 = 15/6 = 6 6/12 =.5 12*.5 = 6.\n\nLizzie has 6 crayons.\nWe are given three statements and our job is to solve equations using our math skills to show that we can fill in the answers correctly.\n\n### Input.\n\nEight of a dozen donuts are left. Nine of the sliced bread are cut. Seventeen of a dozen donuts were left.\n\n\n### Demostration.\n\nFor the first sentence, we know that we subtract eight from twelve and we get four as the number of donuts left.We know that we take 9 of a dozen means that ten donuts remain, we write this as 10\u20139 = 1.For the second statement, we know that we take away a dozen donuts from 17 and we\u2019ll get four remaining, so 17-12 = 5.So, eight \u2013 nine(8-9)=four(12 - 9) = four; nine \u2013 10 = 1\n\nWe have four donuts left and we also have one donut that gets cut for every 12 donuts baked, and so 10/12 =.833, so we cut one. So, four \u2013.833 =.567\n\nNow, we have six donuts left. Seven, for every dozen, equals 0.583 of a donut. Six \u2013.583 =.617\n\n### Final Answer.\n\nSeven of a dozen donuts, were left, and a quarter of a dozen to be cut to leave 7.777 donuts", "answer": " 27"}

{"text": "Jason goes 30 times to library in 4 weeks.\n\n### Output: 60/2x\n\n### Explanation:\nThe first statement reads that the library is visited 4 more times than William visits it.  As this is 4 more times as opposed to 4 less which in this case would be 4/6 times.  the answer must be 4/6, or 3/2 times.\nThe second statement reads William goes every Tuesday.  This means that William goes 2 times a week with each time in a different week in succession.  This gives us 2x.  The final statement is to add or multiply the previous statement together which yields 4/6x.\nWe can go a step back to the previous set of statements to look at the first instance of the word \"visit\" and replace 4 in the fraction 6/4 with 2x which is 2 times the amount of times that William visits the library.  Finally, we will see that 2 times every Tuesday is the same as every Tuesday (1x) which yields a fraction of 3/2.  Put them together to get this problem solved.\n\n### Input and Output Example:\n#### Input:\nThe pencil is in the cup.\nThe pencil has the eraser on it.\nThe pencils are in the drawer.\nThe penciles have a yellow colour.\nThe pencile is in the cup in the draw.\nWhere is the pencil?\n\n#### Output:\nThe pencils have a yellow colour. The penciles have a brown colour.\n\n#### Explanation:\nThere are 4 sets of pencils in the statement. From the first statement we know that one of these pencils that is mentioned in the second set of statements has an eraser on it.  This tells us that the first two sets of pencils are out of the drawer as it says in the latter set of statements.  From the former statement, we can say that the penciles are in the drawer (the second set of statements) while the first set tells us that the eraser must be on the final pen in the fourth set.  This is why this pencil is in a cup in the drawer.", "answer": " 32"}

{"text": "The answer to the question is 4. He has four months of baseball season. In four months at $10,he has earned $40. To make up the $100 needed for the season, he needs to make $200 more. If he earns $200 more, it means he has $100 left over for the actual baseball season. That means that once he has saved $100, he won't need to save more. But his season will be 4 months long, which means he needs to do 2 months worth of shoveling, 2 months worth of mowing, and 2 months worth of raking. That means he does $10 for each month of shoveling, $10 for each months worth of mow, and $10 for each mow month of raking. To make the $100, Gerald will need $40 in savings over the 2 months of shoveling, and $60 over the 2 months with the $10 for mow and the $10 for raking.

{"text": "There were 40 chairs total with a capacity of 80 people (2 people on each.). There were 2/5 of those chairs that were not occupied. The remaining chairs held 2 people each. We can use the Fundamental Counting Principle formula to find the number of board members. There were 80 people in all (40 chairs x 2 people on each), and there were 2/5 unoccupied chairs. 2/5 is a fraction of 1, which means 2/5 of 80 is 16 which is \u00bc.

However, in the end it is not required that he wash all of the 4 windows, because by washing 4 of the 64 windows it just takes 10 minutes. We can just multiply 10 by the number of windows to get the answer. For example:\n\n4*(64/0.4) = 64\n\nBecause 4*0.4 is just 4/4th of 8 windows. It will take 4/4ths or 4 minutes to wash the 4 windows. By multiplying 4 by 64, we just multiply by the whole number of windows(4).\n\n## Requirements\n\n1.

Fractions are the amount of the things needed to be done, this means that the recipe for a brownie has a total of 1.0 cup water.\n\n###  Step 2: Add like denominators to write an equivalent fraction. The fraction.62 will now be 1. This means that for every one cup of flour; we also need.62 cups of sugar,.62 cups water,.62 cupeas, and.62 cups salt.\n\n### Summary: Using the total of the things needed to complete a brownie recipe, we will see that we should add two fractions (two cups, two fractions) into one.

This is done by dividing the whole by the same denominator and doing subtraction.\n\nStep 2: After you divide the whole by the same fraction, you do subtraction in order to find out the fraction that you need. A whole of 2.3 will mean to divide it by.62 so 2.3 \u00f7.62 = 3.66 This means that out of one.62, we now find out that we need to have.66 of the whole because the 3.66 will now equal.66.\n\n### Input 1: What is the sum of 2.6 +.4 + 3.8?\n\n### Input Response:\n$$\\frac{2.6+3.8}{2}$$\n\n### Input response:\n$$\\begin{align}1\\end{align}$$\n\n### Instructor's feedback :\n\nGood, a + and the remainder.\n\n### Learner's feedback:\n\nW", "answer": " 180"}

{"text": "```\nChang's Garden received $40 from their sales. Chang has 3 kinds of apples, sweet, sour and unidentified. He received $40 from his sales, which is less than the total he spent. $40 - $5 = $35 spent. $35 spent on (3 types) sweet apples, sour apples and unidentified apples. We know the total sweet apples he receives is 75% of his total apples, since only 1/4 of his total apples are sour, he gets 75% sweet apples. $0.5 = $.48 75% is equal to $0.4 = $0.33 25% is equal to $.18. \nUsing the fact that there's 3 different types of apples, we can say that Chang Garden earns $-2.93, for their expenses. Now, using the same logic, if Chang can only sell one type of apple, he should receive $12.50 from his sales. If Chang doesn't sell his unidentified apples to us for $0 then he will still get $-2.93 in expenses. \nNow, all we have to do is plug in the amounts from before to reach the desired answer. \n$35 spent on (identified type of apples) = $.33 earned \n$40 minus.33 = $36.67 earned\n$35 spent = $36.50 earned  \n$36.67 -$35 = $1.67 +$1.00 = 2.67 = $.48 \n```", "answer": " 100"}

For this reason, in order to allow us to focus our efforts on those whose orders are less time sensitive, we are changing our standard shipping date to the second week of May.\n\nI want you to take your time making a new selection that makes sense for you, and we'll be happy to try to make it happen for you as soon as the product is available.\n\nFinally, let me take a moment to thank you for your business.

In the instruction, it says that after deleting 70% of the original files and downloading 800 new ones, after deleting 3/5 of the new ones, how many files are left with in the end. There is a lot of information but the key to solving it was to know that we have to figure out how many files we start out with (70%) because that's the base number that we have to subtract when we go through it on the second round, since 800 - 70% we will start with 200 which then become 300 when we delete the 3/5 of those. At this point, the instruction doesn't give any indication otherwise so simply multiplying the 200/3 becomes 66.7% which means we will have 66.7 of the files left over.", "answer": " 400"}

In this scenario, the application did not recognize the input or gave an invalid instruction, and thus the instruction was completed with an invalid response. There are multiple ways to correct a failing test so I will be addressing how to correct the problem and what could have gone wrong to make this the case.\n\n- The first thing I would do if I had a failing test would be to run the application in debug mode and investigate what is happening with the application. The application may be working exactly as expected but for some reason, it is not recognizing the input properly and giving a response. In this scenario, I would run the application and run the steps over and keep running the test until I finally got the output that I expected. Usually, running the application in debug mode will allow you to see that there was some sort of error, but if this is not the case, then I would check the input to verify that the application can read the steps properly. \n- The second thing that I would do if the application was not reading the steps would be to verify that the step had been loaded correctly into the application in the first place.  Whenever you add a step into the application, there is a check that gets performed to validate if there is an error within the instruction. The problem that I often run into is that the instruction may be very vague and not necessarily follow the rules of writing the instruction given on", "answer": " 12"}

If we use a different example with three students in the class there are two ways that we can describe the number of student in the class when two students leave the class.\n\n### A: We have a situation where there were three students in a class with two of them leaving. That would leave only one student in the class.\nB: There are two solutions to the problem in which two students leave the classroom. We could either say that if we have the two students leaving and add that onto to the original number of students in the class there will no longer be three students remaining in the classroom.\n\n### We could also say there is a situation where two students are leaving the class and the new total number of students in the room will be the other students minus those who were leaving.\n\n### In both situations you may notice that when you are taking away students from the classroom the remaining set will increase.  However in one case it is through addition and in the other solution it is through subtraction.\n\n### The number of students we are working with in this problem will always add in the second scenario. That means that the number of students in the final set will be the total minus the number we start with.\n\n### What is the solution to our new problem?\n\n### In a case with three students adding a student in the classroom will never make the total number of students go from being three students to four students.  However in the second case with subtracting one student from the classroom that number would change to being three minus one or two students remaining in the class.\n\n```\nResponse There are two solutions to this problem.\nThe first solution has us taking away two students from the original classroom,", "answer": " 37"}

Therefore, there will be 8 meters moved between each unicorn and the unicorn next to him (13) meters altogether.

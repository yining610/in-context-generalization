If he could climb the rope 4 meters higher each second, how long would it take him to descend the rope?\"\n\n### Response :\nThe answer is 15 seconds.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. First, understand the question. Here, the climb up the rope has been mentioned in 7 seconds. \n\n2. Then, answer based on the question. This question was asking about the man's ability to climb and descend the rope in a sequential and faster process. \n\n- Climb up the rope to a certain height(10 meters) is possible but descend in 3 seconds can only be done if the rope is lowered to another height. The only way to do this is when the man is still on top of the rope and lowering the rope to another height by himself. \n- Once he is on the ground and starts to climb up, the rope now remains the same with the height of 4 meters. After climbing to that length the rope will automatically drop/descend with a certain weight. \n- This would require two more seconds so altogether 5 seconds. \n- To descend the entire rope the man will be taking 7 seconds and climbing to the top is taking 10 seconds. \n\n3: The answer is 15(7 seconds + 5 seconds to reach the top)+(10 seconds to climb down + 5 seconds to descent = 15 seconds).\n\n- If we consider this in another way, if we are able to climb to a certain height say 10 meters more in 1 second it will take the person to climb the rope in 10 seconds. In 1 second he climbed to 2*10 meters=20 meters. The rope was reduced by 20 meters which means it would take", "answer": " 42"}

(r) here refers to the deal price at grocery store and (t) refers to the deal at tailor shop. r, g are given in the question. \n\n1. If we assume that t=12 cans and r=12 cans, we get the prices of tailor shop can (t) = $12.0 and grocery store can (r) =$6.0. Now, by definition we know that t =r/12. Hence, we have 12t=12r/12. Hence if 12t=r, we get t=r/12. We get 12(r/12)=r. Or, r =12. We get r=12. And, this means that t=12. Hence, the cost per can at tailor shop is $12.\n\n2. If we assume that r=t=12, we get the equation 12=12. This equation has no solution, so this cannot be the answer.\n3. Let m be the minimum number of cans we want at tailor shop and p be the maximum number we want at grocery store. Since we want 48 cans in total we know p=12. Also, we want fewer cans in comparison to grocery store at tailor shop. Hence, m <p. Here, we have t=rn. Now, t =r/m, and m=12. We get t = r/12. We have 12t(r/12) = r. By putting r=12 in the equation, we see we get 12*12t=144 which we don't have at all. Hence, the answer is not p =12.\n\n4.

The second cat made meows at double the frequency of first cat.  )\n\n1. Break down the words into numbers and evaluate each number independently. \n2. The expression \"the first cat meowed, 3 times per minute\" can be rephrased as \"at the frequency of 3 per minute\".\n\nNow, 3 can be replaced by a number \"x\". So, \"the first cat meows at the frequency of x\"\n\n3. Now, break the second sentence similarly to write it in the form: ( 2 * the frequency of 1, which is x = 3 )\n\n\"the second cat made meows twice at the frequency of 3 \"\n\n4. Now using addition and multiplication, substitute numbers for letters so that we get: 2 * (3 times x), which is ( 6/ x )\n\n\"the first cat meows 3 times per minute, that is 6/ x\n\n5. Using multiplication and division, substitute for x by 5, and replace the fraction by (6/ 5)\n\n(6/ 5) times 2, which is ((6/ 5) / 2)\n\n6.

Write a response below to demonstrate how the task is to be done.\n\n### Input (2): There are 100 rabbits and 30 deersthats are living in a field. Three hunters will hunt them. The three hunters will hunt a total of thirtysix deer and will kill 75% of the total. How many surviving rabbits and deer are there?\n\n### Solution: In the question, we know that it is about hunting deer. So, first we identify where the deer are hiding. From the question, we know there are 80 living deer, which is equivalent to 100 deer minus 30 deer that hunters kill.\n\n1. Now we need to identify how many surviving deer there will be after the 3 hunters are finished with the hunting. From the data, we know that each hunter kills a total of 36 deer. This means they kill 12 deer between the three hunters (each hunter kills a 4th of deer).\n2. Now, we know there is a total of 80 deer alive, out of 100. That means only 1/20th would survive after hunting is completed (3 hunters hunted a total of 3 hunters, which is equivalent to a total of 12 kills divided by 3 hunters). \n\n3. Using this information, we conclude that even after hunting the deer, there will be a total of 48 deers survive. \n\n4. Now, the final step we need to identify is there is how many rabbits being hunted in the background. From the question, it mentions that the 3 hunters will hunt 36 deers, which is equivalent to hunt total of rabbits, multiplied by 3 deer per hunter. That means, there are 120 rabbits. \n\n5-9.

{"text": "Input: Jessica paid $1,000 for rent each month, $200 each month for food, and $285 each month for car insurance the past year. This year her rent increase by 30%, her food costs increase by 150%, and car insurance increase by 215% because she was at fault of an accident. To calculate the total cost for food, we take the total cost of food, 50% the total cost for rent, and the amount that was spent on car insurance. Therefore, that year's total expenses came out to $5340. Since her food costs doubled, her total expenses increased by two times $5340 to the next year. We then take this number and subtract the previous year's expenses. This yields us the answer of $6,860 is how much more Jessica pays for her expenses over that of the previous year.\n\n### Input (2):The difference between $387 and the smaller number is 23. What is the smallest number?\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The rule of exponents is used to solve this problem. The exponents in the problem are raised to the highest power and then subtracted to give the answer.\n\n2. Look at one of the two numbers $387.\n\n3. Notice that the number $387 is written as $387 to the first power of 2. For example, we have $387 to 2nd power = $387\n\n4. Now, compare $387 and $387 raised to the 2nd power.\n\n5. Now we see that $387 raised up to the 2nd-power means adding 2 to the end of the number $38.\n\n6. So $387 to first power = $38 7 or $387\n7. $387 = 387 or 38\n\n8. $387 x 38 = $ 387 x 2 = $774\n\n9.

How many are in that class?\n\nAnswer: The question can be phrased in various ways. However, the important takeaway is to have a firm understanding of the given information. Specifically, the information given states that \"40% of the total students are in class A.\" (Refer to the bold highlighted words.) This means for every 100 total students (in the school), 40 are in class A. It's important to understand this concept because it will be used throughout the problem.\n\nNext, it states that \"class B has 26 fewer students than class A.\" As we know that class A is composed of 40% of all the students, we can say that class A needs to hold at least 54% of total students. If class B only holds 26 students fewer than class A, then there must be less than 66% students in class B. Thus, class B must hold fewer than 66% of total students.\n\nAfter understanding all of this information, all that is left is to solve the problem. To do so, it helps to write an expression based on the given information. \n\nClass A:  \\({{{.4}} \\over {100}} = {{.4}}*100\\approx 40\\text{ students}\\)\n\nClass B:  \\({{{40 -.26}} \\over {1 -.26}} = {{40 -.21}} \\over {0.79}\\approx 26\\text{ students}\\) (It's important to note that the class size in class B drops by \\([{{0.26}} \\over 100] =.026\\cdot 100 = 2.6 \\) students. )\n\nClass C:  \\({{100-26-40} \\over {10}} = {{40} \\over 84} = {{44} \\over {84}}\\text{ students}\\)\nTo get these values, start by taking the entire population of students in the school, multiply by 1/100 to get whole number of students per", "answer": " 37"}

This is evident if we notice how $30k increased as follows:\n\nGretel's $30k a yr increased to $33k since she received a 15 % raise.\nThis means Gretel's new wage was obtained by multiplying $30k by 10/100, which is 3000 * 1.15.\n\nHansel's $39.8k a yr increased by a rate of (1*10/10)=10% which is equivalent to 1000. \n\n### Question Answer\nQuestion:  How many marbles are in 1.4 pounds?\n\n### Solution\n\n### Solution:\nA number can have more than 1 answer depending on the interpretation. But here we have to consider the numbers in pounds and marbles as weight.\n\nMarbles and pounds are units of weights and not 2 quantities therefore in context they are comparable. But in the solution, 1.4 pounds is converted to kg (kilograms) and then 1/48000kg is obtained as the required amount of marbles, which is $1.4/16kg = $0.09kg. \n\nThis value was obtained using this sequence of methods.\n\n(1 lb = 0.45kg). Since 1.4 pounds = 0.436kg, multiply this result by 81.6gr to get 35 (1.4lb)kg.\n\n1/35kg = 0.09kg\n\nThe total number of marbles that are equal to 1/35kg is 9\n\nThe solution to this equation is $0.45 x 81.6g = $3.73g, which we divided into 35 parts to obtain 0.09 kg\n\nThis is the final value given for the number of marbles.\n\n### Input\n\nQuestion: How much money did Nora have?\n\n##", "answer": " 1500"}

The $1 in Lily's possession after the sale of four tickets represents the number of tickets on which the total number of tickets, 5, has been divided by 4, and hence the resultant is $1.\n8.

Each of the instructions should be addressed in a paragraph or a part of a question or a part of it. \n\nTony didn't work the entire day: It doesn't tell us the time of day that Tony helped with assembling widgets. So since we have a fixed number of hours between Sam, Jack and Tony working and the number of widgets completed, we can deduce that Tony didn't work for the full 8 hours (he worked for a little less than the 8 hours).\n\nTo make the scenario clear: \n\nLet's assume Tony worked from 9 AM - 2 PM, and for the rest of the day, he just did supervisory duties and made sure that the other 2 workers were helping with assembling. Even if we assume he spent every moment of his 8 hours helping with assembling, he wouldn't have been able to assemble as many widgets as Sam and Jack.\n\nSo, Tony didn't assemble 8 widgets, but let's say he helped Sam and Jack assemble 4 widgets each, which sums up to just 12 widgets. (Tony did more than this, but to simplify the scenario, we'll make Tony help with 4 widgets each).\n\nWe know that for the entire day, they were able to assemble 68 widgets, and that Sam and Jack worked for a total of 10 hours. \n\nSo, if we assume Tony worked for 8 hours, that means he contributed just 24 widgets towards the 68 completed widgets. Hence, this means that, taking into account all 3 contributors, each contributor completed 12.25 widgets (68 divided by 5): Sam: 10.5, Jack: 14, and Tony: 12.28.\n\nHence from here we can deduce that, if Tony takes the full 8 hours, he can assemble 12 widgets in a day.\n\n### Inputs: A student is studying algebra.

{"text": "Answer:A: The average number of pages Yasna must read per day is 30 pages.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. First, determine from the instructions, what is being asked at every given day and what is given. \n\n2. Based on the information, we need to understand how long it will take to finish the two books. If Yasna has to read both books in two weeks, two weeks = 14 days. One book in 180 pages. The other book is 140 pages. Divide the number of pages into the number of days. 180 pages into 14 days would give us 13 pages per day. 140 pages into 13 days would give us 5 pages per day. So, in 14 days we would read 38 pages and in 13 days, we would read 15 pages. So, the average of the two days would be 30 pages.  (13pages + 15 pages = 38 pages; 15pages + 5pages = 20 pages; (13+15)/2 = 12.5; (38+20)/5 = 18; 18 divided by 2 = 9 pages. Then 9 pages = 18; and 18/2 = 9 pages)\n\n3.

Find a way to organize information that's being asked about. For instance, there's a count of 39 per pack.\n\n3. For a) loads he does, it could be either 3 or 4. So, if loads per day are 4, then loads which would be a week are 4.  Given this number, there are multiple options that could help us arrive at the correct answer. \n\n4. For b), find how many years there are in a day, in a month, or in a year.  For example, we have a day, then there are 30 days in a month, and 365 in a year. So, for this one, year equals 365 days. \n\n5 For c) calculate how many packs there are per year, where packs= 39. We know the units (a), where year=365, therefore, we will multiply 365 with 39 and find it is 1345. \n\n6.

For choice C: This method is not suitable here where the division method would not work as we calculate the middle and then subtract the amount from the total giving 40 - 12 = 28 which again would have to be evenly divided in half making these sliced equal to 14 each. Thus, the options A and C are not relevant here.\n\n6. For the choice D: This method would have to evenly divide each of the whole slices of peppered pizza in half making 2 slices equal to 4 each.

{"text": "The method that can be used to calculate the birth year is to substitute the birth year in each term of the equation in the question and subtract the value from the year. So, 9 + 4, i.e., 9 plus 13, becomes 22. By subtracting this from the year, we get 14, thus the year of birth is 1914. Also, one can think of doing the following: \n\n1. By process of elimination, we can determine that the answer is not equal to the year 1976 because the number of siblings and the distance between the grandmother's birth year and that of Connie's great-great grandmother is more than 20. And if we set the years of the siblings as follows: 1914 = GM, 1945 = older brother, \n\nand 1976 = older sister, the only two possible combinations are GM=1932 and GM=1975.\n\n2. As the distance between the two siblings is 1+18+19+26+14 =41 years, they are separated by 40 years, so, the gap between one sibling and the other is 1932 - 1975 + 1 = 15 years.\n3. The age of elder sister can be calculated by subtracting their ages in 1935, which gives 20+4-34=20.\n\nTo see which equation is feasible, consider the gap between the three siblings and the two equations. \n\n1. If you set the equation for GM=1914 and GM=108, the gap between the two is 84, which is greater than 40. Hence, option A cannot be the correct choice.\n\n2. If you set the equations for GM=107 and GM=122, the gap between the siblings is 14, which is less than the gap that is required, 40. Hence option B cannot be the correct choice either. \n\n3.*If you set the equation for the older brother's birth year as GM=1945 and set the equation for older sister as GM=1", "answer": " 1944"}

{"text": "To complete the instruction and answer the required question, we must first identify key concepts in the instruction and then analyze them.\n\n### Summarization: \n1. Instruction: Melanie is making meatball, and for the recipe, she requires breadcrumbs. \n\n2. Demonstration: As per the instructions, we understand that Melanie is required to prepare breadcrumbs. So, the first step is to obtain bread pieces, which would involve cutting the bread slices. We will start our calculation by first finding the number of bread slice Melanie is required to cut.\n\n3. Instruction: Meliane cuts an entire loaf of bread. She tears each one slice into half, and then she tears those halves in halves.\n\n4. Demonstration (Rationales): In the instruction, we see that Melanie is using her entire loaf of bread to prepare meatball. This means that she tears a bread loaf into sections and then tears those sections into smaller pieces, each time reducing the size of the cut pieces by half.\n\n5. Response: So, the first bread cutting involves tearing 1 loaf of bread into 2 slices each. This means that Melanie ends up cutting 2 bread slices.\n\n6. Next, she tears each 2 slices in half and then tears each half in half, which results in 4 small pieces or 2 halves of 2 halves. This leads to 4 bread pieces that Melanie will require for preparing breadcrumbs.\n\n7. Answer: Melanie will need 4 bread pieces.\n\n8. Finally, we will use the addition concept of a half + another half + and another half + yet another half = 1 piece. We end up getting 4 pieces, which equals 2 halves from 2 halves of two halves. A total of four equal 4 pieces. \n\n### Remediation: If the answer or response is not satisfactory, the remediation instruction should follow the incorrect response with a reiteration of the right answer.\n\n\n## 4.3.1- Analyzing Task, Reliable Assessment, Writing \nHere is the instructions.

{"text": "Input: Marcos has to get across the lake in his speed boat in 10 minutes.\nRationales: The task of a data analyst is to determine the right solution to a question or problem.\nSo, how does one determine the answer? First, we need to understand the problem or question. \n\n- We look at input and output. For the question in the example above, the input is \"Marcos has to get the lake in his speedboats\".\n- However, \"10 minutes\" is the output we are looking for. \n\nSecond, understand exactly what the input and output mean. \n\n- \"Marcos\" may mean the boat that is going to be used to transport him across.\n- \"Fast\" means how fast would the boat have to travel to make it in time to reach work. \n\nThird, look at choice A - 25 mph for the boat in order to make it in time. \n\n- Marcos also said that he needed to make it to work in no more than 10 minutes so that he doesn't lose his job. But, \"in no more than 1 minute\" means his boat can't have a speed of 25 mph since it's a bit too fast.\n- \"In a speed boat\", for this instance, meant a boat that uses fast motors or engines to keep the boat steady and moving. \n- So, since \"in a speedboat\" has a limit of 25 mhp, \"25 mph\" can't be the right answer. \n\nFourth, look at choice B - 18 mph or 18 miles per hour. This answer seems much more reasonable since \"fast\" means it needs to be 25 mph but it can't be above a certain limit and also, the time is 10 minutes which is less than 25 mph.

{"text": "He ate 1 sandwich more on Monday than Tuesay\n\n### Rationale:From the statement, the only variable values are \"lunch\" and \"dinner\", we need to understand how the statements are presented. Lunch is 3, and the dinner is twice the values of \"lunch\". So, the total meals Samson ate on Monday would be 6.\n\nThe next morning, he felt so sick from eating all the sandwiches, so Samson ate one sandwich less than on Monday. So, the total he ate on Tuesday is 5.\n\nThen, we have to figure out how \"Monday\" and \"Tuesday\" add up. \"lunch\" could be 6, and \"dinner\" is twice the values of lunch. If we use Tuesday for dinner, the equation can be represented as 6 = 2(x). Therefore, we get x = 3.\n\nSo if we take Monday to represent lunch, if we subtract x from it, and it gives you dinner = 3. If we use Tueuday for dinner, it would mean that the remaining would be x - 3. We can use substitution of Monday to represent \"a lunch\" with the value of 3, and \"Tuesday\", the dinner, is 2(3), which is 6.\n\nHere, we have Monday for lunch, and Tuesday for dinner. After taking breakfast. So the final total would be \"lunch\" + \"dinner\" - \"breakfast\". Hence, it remains 5 + 3 - 1 = 5.", "answer": " 8"}

This means each item represents (1/5) = 0.2 unit.\n\nLet T be the total number of items (bags) that need to be purchased. This can be given by n - 4 where n is the total number of students in the class and 4 represents the number of bags for each student as indicated in the question. n = 25 - 4 = 21. In this case m < 21 so we know there is a set maximum of bags that can be purchased (m bags are available for purchase). \n\nSince we know that only m bags are available, we have a constraint on bags that need to be purchased as per the set limit.\n\nSo far, we have the total number of students and the total available bags. We also know the value of required budget (as indicated by m) and the cost associated with each bag. To determine the least number of bags to be purchased by the teacher, we need to find the best set of m such that 1. the total cost of all the bags purchased is the minimum and 2. The value of purchased bags is the minimum (number of bags being the minimum). Based on the given conditions, we can determine that m should be 11. Thus, the teacher will be required to purchase 11 bags or packs so that the cost spent per unit value is minimum and thus the total cost of the bags purchased per student is minimum as well (as we have 11 students at the end).\n\nHence the final answer will be as per the condition given (m should be 11).\n\n### Source:TED: The Official TED Website\n\n### Instructions:How is the brain affected when a person engages in a conversation?", "answer": " 17"}

{"text": "Input:A car is drivingthrough a tunnel with many turns\n\nRationales:\n1. First, analyze what information is already given, and what information is being asked for.\n\n2. In this case, the question is seeking the distance as measured on a clock from the 3rd turn to the car's 4th turn.\n\n3. Recall that on a clock, one turn clockwise can be written as 1 clock tick. As such, a \"right-hand turn\" amounts to 1/4 of a rotation of the clock, to be precise, the 90-degree angle formed by 12 'o'clock to 3 'o'clock.\n\n4. Here, the task refers to 4 \"right-hand turns\", which adds up to 1/2 rotation of the clock.\n \n5. The starting position is at a distance of 23 meters. To understand which distance the car is after the 4th turn (also known as the 7th 180-degree turn), the car can be rotated (clockwise) 1/2 rotation and then move counter-clockwise by 1/4 rotation, for a total of 7 1/4 turn.\n\n6. As the car makes a total of 7 turns, 7 1/3 meters will be added to the \"distance\" as measured on a clock.

{"text": "Choice A Choice C Choice E\n\nRationale:  \n1. \tFirst, understand the question properly, so you know what you are asked to find in the problem. \n\n2. \tIn this problem, it says that for the whole week, the three teens together earned $60. The total amount they earned cannot be divided by more than two because $60 is the total that the three earned for the entire week.\n\n3.\t3. It is given that half of the $660 was earned by \"Lisa\". It further states that \"Tommy earned half of what Lisa\" earned. Now, we cannot calculate the amount that Tommy earned as the division has to be done by the total amount among the three teens. \n\n4.\tHowever, since \"Tommy earned half as much as Lisa\", then we can infer that the total amount that the three of them earned is $60. \n\n5 Since half of $60 is $30, and $30 was earned by \"Tommy\", we can further infer that Lisa earned exactly twice the amount that Tommy earned. \n\n6\tSo, the amount Lisa earned can be calculated by subtracting $30 from $60, giving us $30 difference. \n\n7\tThus, Lisa earned $30 (half of $60) more than Tommy.\nAnswer choice A\n\n### Input\nCatherine likes to exercise.

{"text": "Rationales:\n\n1. First you have to clearly understand the question. For this, understand that the part of assignment is the time that will be taken for completion in every part.\n\n2. Also, understand that the first part took 25 minutes to complete. And when the second part was taken, \"he took twice as long to finish\".\n\n3. \"Twice as long\" means that the second part of the assignment took 40 minutes to complete.\n\n4. Once both the terms \"part\" and \"time taken\" are clarified in our mind, we proceed to the answer part to get the final solution.\n\n5. We already know that if the first part took 1/3rd of the total time taken for the entire assignment, then 2/3rds of the total time is taken for other two parts. \n\n6 and 4/3rds respectively. And the time for all the 3 parts sums to make 70 minutes. \n\n7.

{"text": "Answer A: 9 feet\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nFollowing line of reasoning is how I arrive at my response. Please see how you can derive this logic from me as well : \n\nInput: Let X be the first ball of yarn. \n\nX = 0.5 X\n\nX = 3/2 X\n\nThen, X is the size of the second yarn.\n\nAssume the size of each ball to be 10 feet or simply 10.\n\nY = X\n\nX = first ball\n\nY = first ball\n\nX = second ball\n\nY = second ball\n\nX = third ball\n\nY = third ball\n\nX = 27 feet\n\nY = 9 feet\n\nX/Y --> 27/9 = 3 --> answer is C = 3.\n\n### Note:\nThese are some hints in the problem, which we use to decide which method to use when solving a task.\n\n1. I identify the 27 feet as the variable of volume X and the 9 feet as the variable Y.\n\n2. Each time the ball doubles in size, we add two to the total of feet it'd take to make the ball. By adding 2 to the total of feet for each ball, we find out which ball the yarn went to and which number represents the total feet. \n\n3, We apply the same number to the rest of the other balls.\n\n4. This helps us to know our answer.\n\n5. Notice how each time the ball doubles in volume, it doubles in yarn use as well!\n\n6. When the first ball doubles to account for the second, we add 2 to the variable that is also used to account for the 27 feet. \nThis helps us to answer which 3rd ball and which 27 feet.\n\n7. Once we know that ball, applying the same 3 in our formula, we simply use 9 for the number of feet needed to complete our 2nd ball!\n\n  \n  ### Input:A certain number is multiplied by 49, subtracted by 6, then subtracted by the remainder when 224 is divided by 123.

{"text": "The principal can book as many rooms as she needs to meet the class requirement.  The total number of booked rooms will be equal to the total number of students in the class.  So, to meet this requirement, the principal should book at least 30 rooms; no matter how big or small the class is, this will be the right number.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. First, understand the question properly.  It is a bit confusing because of the structure of the paragraph and the way the answer is described.  The sentence \"How many rooms does the principal...\" seems to indicate that the response has more than one correct answer, such as \"20, 25, 30, etc\" but the next sentence clarifies that the correct answer is actually \"30.\" So this sentence has to be ignored or disregarded.  All other sentences are correct and only present information about the type of rooms to be booked.\n\n2. There are two types of rooms: Queen size beds and Pull-out couches.  Queen rooms can be made up of two students each, while the couch can only make one student sit on it; either way it may not completely fit all the students.  Also, the total number of students to make up the class is 30; hence, the principal must book at least 3 rooms.\n\n3. The last sentence states that the principal has to book as many rooms as needed; even if there is just one student in the entire field trip, the principal should book 30 rooms.  So, the only way to solve the problem is the book 30 rooms, no matter what the class size is.\n\n### Input 1: I want to make dinner tonight, what ingredients do I need?

{"text": "Input: The owner of a Turkish restaurant...\nRationales:\n1. First, understand the information in the question and establish an idea. Here, we are told that a Turkish restaurant owned by someone ordered four-pound packages of ground beef from three butchers. The butchers deliver meat packages to the restaurant in two days, and on two different times. Then, it was specified that a delivery of 10 four-pound packages was delivered by the first butcher on the morning. Later, 7 four-pound packages were delivered by the second butcher. Lastly, the third butcher delivered 84 pounds of ground beef, packed in 26 four-pound packages. Hence, the last butcher is most likely to arrive the latest.\n2. Choice A - 15: This is incorrect since it can be eliminated from the three initial butchers who delivered meat. The idea is to eliminate a \"wrong\" or \"incorrect\" choice.\n3. Choice B - 14 \nThis can be eliminated since it can't be a correct answer because it is lower than choice C and D which are correct. It is incorrect/wrong. Hence, it can be eliminated.\n4. Choice C - 104: This is the most obvious and correct answer since it has two four-pound packages each from all three butchers. Since all the \"other\" choices don't make sense, which is a reason to eliminate them from the given choices, the correct answer here is answer choice C.\nRationales: By process of elimination, the most probable answer remains choice C. However, it is also possible to reach choice C by process of addition. In this case, 10 four-packages are added to 7 four-packages, and 84 pounds can be divided by 104 pounds. Hence, 84 pounds is equal to 104 pounds of ground meat.\n\n### Input\nI own a carpet store selling rugs in many different shapes and sizes.

{"text": "Input:A car uses 16 gallons of gas to go 400 miles and holds 8 gallons. \n\nFirst, understand the question thoroughly. \"Back and forth\" should be noted clearly. This means that we need to determine how many miles can be traveled with the eight gallons.\n\nLet x represent the number of gallons in the tank now. Then, consider the total miles that must be traveled.\n\nIf x gallons remains, then we will have x + 400 miles left. Since the \"600 miles back and forth\" is needed, the first 400 miles must be traveled and then return again to cover 200 miles. \nHence, we have two parts to cover 600 miles: First 400 miles (initial travel) and the second - 200 miles (return trip). \nSo, x + 40% = 62% is our basic formula.\n\nChoices:   \n\"A: 4,300 miles\" : 4,30 gallons since 4300/8 = 537 is the answer. \n\n\"B: 2,940 miles\" : since 2940/8 = 367 and the original number was 400, it should be \"B\" \n\n\"C: 1,470 miles\" : 1470 = 220 and \"traveling\" is mentioned in the question.

Find the greatest speed of a ball thrown upward.\n\n### Response:(a)\nA ball is thrown at an upward direction with  a speed of 30 m/s (a = 30m/s). The ball will travel upwards for a certain distance and will stop after falling at a certain distance. The ball can be assumed to have elongated parabola motion path on the upward direction. Hence, since, it is not thrown in a horizontal direction, it cannot fall on the ball at any angle perpendicular to the direction.\n\n### (b)\nA ball is throw at an angle of 045 degree upward with a speed of 62 m/s (a=62m/s).

{"text": "The fox would run 4000 meters within 120 minutes\n### Rationales:\n 1. Observe the question. The maximum speed at which a fox can run is 50 kilometers an hour. Since, \"running\" at a constant speed, the fox will run for an entire 120 minutes.\n\n2. Now, let us understand what the question is asking. The question wants the distance, i.e. 4000meters is the required answer.\n\n3. In order to find a distance, let us first get a rate to understand the distance covered in 1 hour. In order to find this, we divide the speed by time.\n      The speed required for 1 hour = speed/ Hour = 50/60 = (50/60) kilometers/hour = 16.666 Kilometers/hour \n\n4. Now, divide 60/ Hour= 60/60 = 1 hour. Hence, 1 hour is equal to 1(Hour) so, 1 hour = 1 hour. \n\n5- So, now, we have a rate of 16.6 kilometers an hour. We want to know the distance made by the fox in 120 minutes, so we divide the rate by time.\n\nThe distance covered in 120 Min = Rate/ Time = 16. 6/120 = 0.1333/ 120. Hence, 133 meters would be covered by the fox within 120 Minutes.\nTherefore, The distance covered would be 133 m * 120 min = 16,000 m = 16 Km\nTherefore, The fox would be able to run 16 Km within 120 min.\nThe correct answer to the question is A: 16 Km.\n\n### Commentary:\nLet us focus on the first few instructions of this section.\n\n1.

{"text": "The question first needs to be dissected to understand the context. First of all, we are clear from the question that Miriam spent a total of two years doing all these household activities. Hence, we'll call \"two hours\" as T.\n\nSecondly, the question informs that Miriam spent ___ amount of time doing laundry in the earlier portion of the question. This can be expressed as T = [time spent on laundry] + [time spent cleaning bathroom] + [time spent doing homework] + ___ (not specified in the question). For brevity, let's call that T\u2081.\n\nLastly, the question asks the time spent cleaning the room. It is obvious that one of the two activities must occur before cleaning her room i.e. Miriam either did laundry and cleaned the room or homework, and then did laundry and also cleaned the room. Let's call the total time spent on doing this two activities as T\u2082.\n\nNext, the question asks us to answer the question if she spent a total of 2 hours on all these activities. This is where it could not be figured out that she performed a task which is not mentioned explicitly in the question. But, if one of these two activities is done before the cleaning of the room or laundry, then it clearly shows that T\u2082 = T\u2212T\u2081. \n\nAlso, Miriam spends more time on laundry, followed by cleaning the bathroom and homework, followed by cleaning her room. Hence, T\u2081 < T\u2082 < T3 which can be used again in the answer to provide insight.\n\nHence, the answer will be of one of these three: T\u2082 = T\u2081 - T\u2083, T\u2082 = T\u2083 - T\u2081, and T\u2082 = T\u2083.", "answer": " 35"}

The first thing that we do is get a clear understanding on the given data. We see that Reggie makes three layups, two free shots, and one long shot and that his brother only shoots long ones. Reggie is also the one who loses 10 points.\n\n2. Now, the questions states that \"Reggie makes 3 lay ups, two free shots and one long shot\" and that his brother shoots long shots. Based on this, we can determine that Reggie's shots are lay ups and free throw.\n\n3. Next, we note that everything which isn't a lay up in this game is a long shot.\n\n4. So, Reggie's first free throw is a 2 points shot, so it's a long shot that he has lost a point over. The second free throw would also be a 2 points shot since it is the 2nd one, hence Reggie has lost another point over. In the end, Reggie has lost two points. It is also evident that Reggie has won one point.\n\n5. So, we now have something like this:\n\n- Reggie's first shot is 5 points,\n- Reggie' summary score would be 3 points if only he has 1 free throw remaining for 2 points.\n\n\nWe can now proceed to determine what would be Reggie's actual loss of points. Let us take a look.\n\n- His summary score is 3 points + 1 free throw remaining.\n- In a game like the above shot, we know that the shots he takes would be like this. (If he misses, then each shot would result in Reggie losing a point).\n\n|Points|Layups|Free Throws|Long Shots|\n|:-:|:-:|:-|:-:|\n|Reggie|3|2|1|\n\n\nSo, Reggie's remaining Free Throw is the only shot he has which hasn't been taken yet, which means that if he wins it then his score would be one point higher.

Now, let's assume x1 to be 100 and so on. \n\nNext, Let's say that y=10,xxxx, then x+y=10+4.\nFinally, 10 = 100*(1+4/100). 4/(100) =. 04 (4/100 reduced to fraction)\n04 =. 04 multiplied by a number between 1 to 100 or a percentage between 0-4% (using decimal reduction).\n04=. 04 *.04 =.016\nAs x1 is 100, now multiply.16 by 100 (value of x1).

We can conclude the following possible values of $S$:\n\nSince S must be greater than 0 but less than or equal to the value of J, there doesn't seem to be any negative value of J thus $\\mathbb{I}:=\\mathbb{N}$ thus $J\\in \\mathbb{I}$ and hence $J\\in \\left \\{ 0,1,2,3,\\cdots\\right\\}$ then it must be possible for this sequence to take any positive value less than or equal to 5 i.e. $\\mathbb{I}:=(0,5)$ then $S\\in \\left (0,5\\right)$ and $J\\in \\{(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),\\cdots\\}$\n\nSubstituting these values and solving $f:T\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n$$f:T\\rightarrow S\\rightarrow J\\rightarrow \\left \\{ (0,-1, -1), (6", "answer": " 504"}

{"text": "From September to February, Sam is able to work only for 8 hours. However, he managed to work for 23 hours earlier. Since Sam is saving up to purchase a video game, he needs to work for 15 hours more.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe first thing that we needed to understand is the 23 hours, which is specified as a sub-question. It is given that, Sam did 23 hours of work before the month of September, but did he worked for only 8 hours in the other months.\n\nNow, we need to find out two things:\n- How much money was earned in the first part of the job done (March to August).\n- How much money is spent during the later part of the job (September to February).\nIn March to August Sam earned $460 from 23 hours of labour. That is equivalent to $19.7 per hour.\n\nIn September, Sam was unable to continue with his work which is stated to be in the months of September to February. It can be assumed that he worked for 8 hours every month during this period. Since he is working for 8 hours a month, in a year it amounts to 96 hours. He spent $340 for the repair to his car.\nSo, he can earn only $620. Subtract the $340 spent to repair the car = $280\n\n$280/23 hours = $12 per hour. So, for 96 hours in a year you can earn $12*96 = $1152.\n\nNow, Sam is saving up to make a purchase of a video game console which costs $600. Hence, we require a sum of at least $400 to compensate for the difference. So, Sam needs to earn at least $1552.\n\n$1552+ $260 (earned from the first part of the work) = $1812 < $1812+$ 340(spent on cars) = $2152\n\nSo, the answer is $ 340.\n\n### Input\nIn what language, country, and date was the last episode of the original series of Doctor Who first broadcast?\n\n### Demost", "answer": " 16"}

The question implies that James drives for half an hour with speed 30 mph and during the second half, he doubled his speed per hour.\n\n2. If the time taken is 30 minutes during the first half, and the speed is 30 mph, then the total distance covered is 30 m/h x (30/60) = 6 km. \n\n3, The time for second half is 2 (3x) hours, and the speed is twice of that. Since, the time is twixed of original speed, then the speed for the second half is twice of that ie., 60 mph. \nFor this half, the distance covered is 60 m/h x 2(3x)hrs = 60 x 2 x 3 = 180 km.\n\n4. Since the distance covered in first half is 6 km, and in second half is 180 km, the total distance covered is, (6+ 180) = (186 km). \n\n5.

For the \"+\", use the following example. \n\n1. If we have three numbers, add each other.\n\n2. If we have two numbers, add first with the negative of the other.\n\n3. If we have two negatives, multiply each by 1.\n\n4. If we have two multiplications, use parentheses.\n\nFor this question, the rule of operation is:\n\n1. \"thrice as many\" the unicorn cakes compared to the witch is:\n\n3 \u00d7 number of votes for unicorn cake\n\n2. So, the number of votes for witch is:\n3 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 number of votes)\n\n3. Dividing by three, we get\n1/3 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 the number of votes) = the votes cast\n\n4. The number of votes cast is (1/3 \u00d7 (three times the number of votes for uncorn + times the witch + one fifth times the votes of dragon))\n\n5. So, 7 people voted for witch.

This means the text or document which is supposed to be typed is measured with respect to number of words per minute\n2. Next, identify the second variable in the problem by understanding what is being asked. Here, the second variable is the typing speed (words per minute) of his right hand. \n\n3, This means after an accident, Mike has been using his left hand to type and his right hand is not working for the time being. \n\n4. There is a third variable in the problem which is the type of document that needs to be typed which has 810 words. Hence, understand the problem statement and identify all variables.\n5. Let us assume Mike will take time (a variable) and can types as much as he can per minute (b variable).\n\n6. The first thing to try is to express the variable in terms of some other variable:\nTo begin with, let us consider speed with respect to time.\n\nLet a denote the typing speed (65 words per minute (variable)) in terms of time (t variable).\n7. Substitute time (t) with (810 words / typing speed (a) per minute. Therefore, t may be written as:\n\n\\(t =(810 /a)\\)\n\n8. Next, let us consider typing speed with respect to speed, i.e. the value expressed in \"b\". For speed, we know the value is 65 words per (65) while for typing speed, the value is time/s. Thus, the value of typing speed is t divided by time.\n\nSubstitute the typing speed with the value of \\(810 /t\\).\n\n\\(810 /t = 65\\)\n\n8. Substitute the typing speed now with \\(810 /(810 / t) = t = 810\\). This means 65 words per time is the typing speed for his right hand. 810 is the typing speed for the right hand.\n\n9.

The choices that will give us the total amount of these friends' money need to be combined to get the total.\n\n3. Start calculating Cecil's money first. According to the choices, Cecil's money is $600. Cecil has $250 more than twice as much as another friend, who has $600 as well. So, the friend only has $350. Since both Cecil and the friend have $350 as per the instructions, both of them have the remainder of $600. So, how much do they have altogether now? The answer is $900.\n\n4. Now, consider the third friend. According to the instruction, she has $50 more only than Cecil's money, which means she isn't as rich as Cecil. Her money amount is $350 lesser than Cecil's. The sum of her and Cecil's money total is $900 altogether. Now, the question is how much more do they have altogether. \n\n5.\"they [her, Cecil, and the third friend] have $50 more only as Cecil\", implies that they have the $50 more as the sum of their money.\n\n\n6.

And there is a cumulative probability that each pair will be able to reproduce when they copulate, and that is 1/(1*(128/32)). If we denote 1/(1* (128/3)) as a single number pf then that means there are 32 options to combine the four animals on their 1 to 4 scale (each number can be paired with each number and that leaves 16 options to choose from). Now each couple has their probability of reproducing but that only applies to the pairing. 16 unique pairs implies there are then 16 chances for each couple to reproduce.\n\nFrom there, we know the probability per panda to reproduce is:\n```\n    1/((1 * (128/ 32))= 1/16\n```\nNow when each pair has an equal opportunity to reproduce, there is a 1/16 chance of any of the 16 panda pairs reproducing, making the total panda births 9.\n\n\n## More Info (Sources)\n### https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/cc-6th-probability-distributions/cc-6thgrade-probability/e/probability-word-problems\n### https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37575249/python-probability-find-the-probability-of-selecting-a-couple-in-a-given-pool-of", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "In this question, we have to determine the amount of discount that Clark obtains for purchasing 7 of that specific auto parts.\n\n1. Understand the variables and identifiables to be used in the question. Here we can determine that \"Clark\" could be the customer, \"part\" could be the product or auto parts that he needs, and \"auto shop\" could be any retail store that sells the specific product that is required by Clark. \"Discount\" could be the amount of money that is deducted from the original amount (\"439\") for any purchases. \n\n2. So, the question as a whole can be framed as: How much Clark got as a discount for purchasing 7 parts?\n\n3. The first step is to identify the units of the variables so that the calculations are easier. In this case, we have a quantity of $80 (a part), so the units of \"80\" will have to be determined. Here, the denominator of the quantities is different between the options for discount and purchase. Hence, we need to convert units from (parts) to (dollars) and vice-versa, for simplification of calculations.\n\n4. Next step, identify the relevant ratios. In this case, 7 parts are bought by Clark and he needs to calculate the fraction that was obtained as a discount on the 7 parts. To find the fraction, we can cross-multiply the price of each part ($ 80) multiplied by 7. To obtain the discount, we can use the following equation: [(Price of the item) * (No. of items) (Discount %) / 100]. Applying the above formula, we get the following. \n\n[(80 * 7) * 10 / 100 = 56]\n\nThe $56 is Clark's discount.\n\nAnswer: The amount of discount is $56.\n\n### Input:`Hector is 3 times as heavy as Kyle` how much is Kyle`s weight?\n\n### Demostration:\n1.

Which means that salt is also needed so that pizza can be made. Since we are calculating for half the salt which would amount to 5 teaspoons, multiply it by the total flour and water to find the required quantity \n\n- The amount we need to use is 1.5 x 5 =7.5.\n\n- And finally add the entire calculated quantity to find the total,\n\n- Kimber would require 160 + 128 + 338 + 7.5 = 631.5 oz of water, flour & salt, which roughly weighs 3 kg.\n\nHere, the correct responses are B and C, respectively and the most appropriate answer is C.

Firstly, we note that  the amount of weight that the bear needs to gain and the weight that it had from berry feast in summer. It had gained a fifth of the needed weight before autumn. This amount of weight is (1/5 of the needed weight) which can be calculated as (1/5) *1000 = 200.\n\n4. At the end of autumn, it gained another amount of weight. i.e., (1/2) of the needed weight - so here it had gained twice(2xs) this amount it was supposed to gain during autumn.\nSo, from autumn it had gained ((1/2) of 1000) + 200 = 1400.\n\n5. Now based on the above facts - what is the weight it had gained in total by the end of autumn.\n\n6. So, the answer: 1400 + 200 (which makes 1700 pounds) + 500(since small animals gave 1/5 of the weight it needed) = 2700 pounds.\n\n7. Subtracting the amount of weight(2000) it had gained through the berry feasting during summer = 270 - 2000 gives us remainder(700).

{"text": "The competition is split into four rounds with the first round containing 1 more skip than the second round, the second round with 3 fewer skips than the third round, the third round with 4 more skips than the second round, and the last with only half the number of skipping as the first round.\nWe can see that the rounds are consecutive and that the number of skips in each round increases by 4.\n\nLet's call the number before an increase by 4 the baseline round. So the baseline round has the number of skips before the first competition. Then the first round has 4 units above the original level, the second round has 8 units above, the third round has 12 above, and the last round has 14 units above. We can say that the rounds start with baseline of 0, then goes from 4 to 8 to 12 to 16 and end on 20 (which is 14+4).\nNow we can look at how many skips we want the average to be. First, we must get the total number of skips done in each round.\nTo get for a starting point, we subtract 16 from the number of skips done.\nRound 1 is -16 + 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 = 66 skips\nRound 2 is -16 +4 + 8 +12 + 14 = 58 skips\nRound Three is -16 +1 + 2 + 5 + 7 = 25 skis\nRound 4 is -16 = 0 skis\nTo get the total number of times Jeff skipped, we must sum all these values together.\nSince we only have Jeff skipping, we can simply get the total by how many rounds Jeff could skip in. Since Jeff only completed half the rounds as Sam, we get 4/6 in total.\nIf we had Sam skipping, the total would be 2.\nNow that the total number of times was calculated, we must take the mean.\nBy the end of the competition, Jeff skipped, 66+58+25+16+4+1 = 192 times.\nTo get the mean, we get 192/4 = 4", "answer": " 14"}

{"text": "Firstly, understand what is being given in the question. Here we are required to determine the total number of goats both Paddington and Washington own after adding a number.\n\n1. There are two questions to solve in this question: the first question determines the total number of goat's they own in the first place and the second part is based on this total number.\n\n2. Read the question.\n  \n3. Analyze and understand the relationships between variables. Here, one variable is called \"goats\" and the other is called \"total number of goats of Paddington and Washington\". \n\n4. For the second question, it is clear that Washington has less than or more than a total number of goats. Since the goat's Washington have is less than the total number of goad's that other two have, the question can be reduced.\n  \n5. It can also be simplified as follows: Total number of goat in Paddington's possession, 40 + 140/give in Washington's possession.\n  \n6. Now, we know that Paddington has 140 less than Washington's goats. Now, we need to know the difference between two total numbers to find the total number of both the users.\n  \n7. It can be done as follows: Total number = 140 + 100\n  \n8. Now that the total answer has been arrived at, substitute the values of 40 and 100 into the equation to get the final result.\n  \n9.

We need a third of total clownish to go to their first tank.\n\n10. For Choices C this can't be the case because it states that all the clownfish go to the tank even though the blowfish is greater. So, choice C is discarded.\n\n11. For choice B, all the blowfish enter the tank. Again, this can't happen because all clownish can't join the display tank.\n\n12. Choice B is discarded.\n13.

Answer:\n\n> Streptomyces is a genus of bacteria, first discovered in Japan in the laboratory of Sadao Matsushima in 1922, that produces many medically useful antibiotics. Streptomyces species are Gram-positive bacteria, characterized by branching, multilayered filaments with a diameter up to 100 micrometers. They are considered as a major part of the natural environment, being one of the most abundant organisms in soils. They are important components of the soil's food chain, consuming other microorganisms and releasing nutrients to the soil.\n\n2. Explanation:\n\n>The first discovery was the antibiotic streptomycin, by Selman Waksman in 1943. The genus Streptomyces is composed of over 370 species, which are the major source of over 50% of the currently used antibiotics. The genus is a rich source of secondary metabolites, which are biosynthesized during bacterial growth, often inhibiting other bacteria and fungi.\n\n### Task: The task requires a response that is written like the provided response.

Water consumption of heavy cycle = 20 gallons; light cycle = 2 gallons; regular cycle = 10 gallons; bleach cycle = 1 light cycle\n2. Total water consumption, when all cycles are run is 20+10+1+2+1+21+1; The total volume of water used in a single load is 42 gallons.\n3. In a set of two heavy loads, it means 84 gallons used.\n4. In a set of three regular loads it means 30 gallons are used.\n5. For one bleached load, 2 additional gallons of water are added.\n6.

A quick count will show that she bought 15 chocolates in the entire month and not 7 or 14.\n\nNow, lets see what kind of calculations are needed. We can first figure out how many chocolatest Kantana bought every month. For that, we know that she buys 2 chcolates in the first weekend and 1 chocolate in every subsequent saturdays.

You'd further realize that there is a mention of \"11 blue balls\".\n\n### Demanding evidence:\nLook at Ryan's number of balls in orange colour under \"balls\". And also observe that he has 40 balls in his possession. \"Ryan has 4 balls in each colour except for green\" under \"colours\".\n\n### Identifying the request:\nWhen one has \"40 balls in all\" and \"4 balls in each colour\" other than the rest is \"green\". Since, \"the rest is green\", we'd know that \"the rest have 40 balls combined\". (Note: It's not mandatory that you come up with such conclusions by yourself for each question as you go along).\n\n### The rationale:\nCombining all the above information and logic, we can determine that \"The rest have 16 balls each\". Then, we know \"The rest have 32 balls altogether\". If we further subtract 40 from 40, we get 0 as the quotient because 40 + 16 = 56. Hence, the number of balls that Ryan has excluding red and blue balls is \"zero\".\n\n### The Rationale of Identifying the Correct Answer in one step:\nIn this case, you'd identify the correct answer (in yellow) by noticing the number of ball combinations as in the rationale of the question. It's not required that you have to explicitly list all the possible combinations to solve this question.\n\n## Outputs:\nBased on the logic and calculations above, the actual number is 20. Then, the total number of balls in all is 40 to conclude that \"The rest have at least 5 green balls\".

For instance, the input can be: the cost per bound manuscript X is 10 and the number of copies required Y is 10.\n\n### (3) The solution/ output will be a positive integer. The cost of copying and binding per manuscript will depend on the number of copies and the binding cost per manuscript. So, for 10 copies, the cost of copying and 10 copies would be Y x X = 10 X.  But, the cost of binding 10 copies will be 10Y, so, the cost of the 10th manuscript would be 10X + Y.

In other words, we need to determine the value of Ali to find out the amount owned by James: $40. So, Ali is half of the total amount they own.\n\n1.  First, take  $250 into consideration which is the amount that is owned by both. Write the amount as -  $250.\n\n2.  Next, find out \"Ali's portion\". In this problem statement, \"James\" owns $40  additional funds as compared to Ali's funds. Hence, half of the $250 amount is $125.\n\n3.  Now, \"subtract\" the value of \"Ali's\" from $250 and take it as the \"James' portion\". The value of \"James' portion\" is $125 -  $125, which is  $0.\n\n4.  Finally, James'  value is $125, the \"extra amount\" he possesses.

{"text": "1. Before actually finding the answer to the question, we have to first understand what a cheetah is and what a gazelle is. After that, we need to understand what a cheet will be doing and what a gazelle will be doing in this specific scenario.\n\n2. A cheetah is a small predator and can kill its prey swiftly using its powerful claws and speed. \n\n3-4. If one mile per hour equals about 1.5 meters per second, then to travel 1 kilometer, the cheetah would have to travel at least 15 minutes.\n\n5. After understanding the basics about the cheetah and gazelle, now it is possible to arrive at the answer to this problem. In this case, both animals are on their feet and traveling in the same direction.\n\n6. The cheetah's speed of 60 miles per hour is calculated by: mph = ft/sec 1 mile per hour = 1 mile x 5, 280 feet = 5, 2 80 feet = 1, 000 feet per mile per hour. \n\n7. The Gazelle's speed of 40 miles per second is calculated by: mps = feet/sec 1 mile second = 1 mile x (5, 282 feet/mile) = 1, 111 feet per mile/hour.\n8. 1 mile equals: 1 mile x ft/mi x (5, 528 feet/mi/hour) = 1609.344 feet per mile.\n9. Therefore, the actual distance the animals are from each other would be 210 ft = 210 ft of the cheetah. From 210 feet to speed 60 miles per second is about 20 minutes. This means that the cheetah will almost catch up to the gazelle by the time the gazelle has traveled 5 miles (5, 597 feet) in the same direction for 20 minutes.\n\n10. For gazelle speed, 22 miles per second is: 22 mps = 2, 200 5, 598 feet per mile per hour, which results in 1 second to travel 2 hours.", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "Answer: 1900.\n\n### Answer explanation:\nFirstly, count the number of soccer-camp kids. Thus, this number of kids is equal to half of the kids which is 50%, and 50% of 750 k is 375. Hence, 750-375=375 which is half of the kids in soccer camp. Next, we discard the kids in s.camp, and add an additional 1/4 of soccer camp kids that went in the morning, so we have a total of 900 children in camp. Lastly, the other group which is 1000 k. is not required for this problem, because their number is already known to the questioner. \n\nAnswer explanation is correct. Here is a way to solve it: \n\n1. Number of kids in morning: 1/4 kids going to s.camp:  750*1/4=187.5\n2. Total kids in morning: add morning with night: 187.5+750 = 937.5\n3. Half of k.in morning and night:  937.5*(0.5)/2 = 975\n4. Total kids in s. camp: 375 + 975 = 1350\n5. Total kids: 190 more kids in s. & 1000 from other group.\n\n### Input 2:There are some k in camp.

How many k in camp?\n\n### Answer\nAnswer: 1312\n\n### Answer Justification:\nFirst, determine the denominator by adding 7/8 of the children that go to soccer camp, which is equal to 1/8. Then, the denominator or the total number of kids going to camp is then (1/8+7/8)(1/8) which equals to 1/8x(1/8), and then multiplied by 1", "answer": " 2000"}

So, the first car started at 8.14 and the other car started at 8:30 and reached at 9:30 am. Thus, there is a total of 8 hours.\n\nGiven: x = time remaining for the journey and y = miles/hour.\n\n$$x = \\frac{(369 * y) *3}{42}$$ and by substituting for x, we get y = 91. \nThe second part of question states that Amoli drove for three hours, so x = 3. \nBy the law of sines, $\\sin A = \\frac{y}{91}$. Thus, $y = 91 * \\sin A$\n\n$$\\begin{cases} y = \\sin A * 91 \\\\ [6px] \\Leftrightarrow \\sin (A - x) = \\sin A * \\frac{369/42(y)}{3}\\\\ [12px] \\Leftrightarrowequals \\end{cases}$$\n\nTherefore, we know that the total amount of miles for both cars is $\\sin A * 94, \\cos (A - x) * 91.$\n\nTo verify that all these are in tandem from our question.

{"text": "I will not use any formulas. I will do long division to solve for the weekly expenditure of the coffee.\n\nLet`s do it!\n\nFirst, to get the total amount of coffee that Maddie purchases in a week, we multiply the number of cups of coffee that she drinks to the amount of each cup. So, in a week, Maddie makes 4 cups of coffee. Let's say the coffee has 10 ounces of coffee (each half a gallon of milk does not contain 20 ounces of milk). So, in a week Maddie makes 14 cups of coffee and uses the entire bag of coffee 4 time (i.e. 14 * 10 of beans = 140 oz). Now, we see that 140 ounces of beings makes up for 10.5 oz per bag. So, by knowing this let's calculate the number of bags that Maddie uses in a year.\n\nShe uses 1.5 ounce of coffee in each cup, which means that she uses approximately 4 bags for 140 ounce of beans. She spends one-fifth for one cup of coffee. She drinks two cups daily. So, she spends four-fifth for one month.\n\nNow, to find out how much of coffee her mom spends on each week, we use the following formula: \n\nLet`s try it!\n\nHere, `C1C` represents the total number of one-fifth of one bag of beans and `C2C` represents the number of bags of beans per week.\n\nLet us now write down the formula for finding out how many bags of beans that she uses for one cup of one-fifth.\n\nRewrite the formula to get into the form `C2*C1/5 =C1`.\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by `C2` and then solving for `C1`\n\n`4C2/5*C1 =C1`\n\nNow, if we multiply this equation by 4 we get\n\n `4C2/5 = 1`\n\nMultiplying both sides by `4` we get\n\n`4*4", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "She remains with 89 dogs.\n\n### Explanation:\nInput: Heloise has dogs and cater in ratio of 10 17, with the total number of pet s being 189. If she gives 1 0 dog s to her friend Janet, how many dog s does she remain with overall?\nFirst, we'll determine the total number of pots Heloise remains with. We know that, since there are 189 pets in total, ${{n_{189}}}=10$ dogs. After giving $10$ dogs to her friend, we know that, there are $10$ fewer dogs than what Heloise originally had. That is, ${{n-}_{10}}=189$. Therefore, ${{(\\text{number of dogs Heloise has })(\\text{after giving 10 dogs away }) = 189 }}$.

{"text": "Five actors is the best answer.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nTo determine the number of actors, we need to consider the following factors.\n\n1. We know that each actor does 15 minutes on the show. \n\n2. We also know that every 5 minutes, the actors are replaced with 5 new actors. \n\n3 We also are told, a total of 1 hour is required to complete the show.\n\n4. If 5 people come every 5 minutes, we need to add 5 5s to get the total number of people who go on the show.\n\n5. We also need to see how many people are coming on the show. 5 people come on every 5 minutes and that means 20 minutes out of the hour. We just add 5 5's to that, to see how much time is left. 75 minutes minus 20 minutes = 55 minutes = 75 minutes - 20 minutes = total 55 minutes.\n\n6. We can see that there will be a total of 155 individual performances in 55 minutes for 5 different actors. That gives us 2.8 actors per minute and 155 new performers every hour.\n\n7. So the answer is 5 to get 155 people to change each minute over and over.\n\n### Input:\"Amy\" should be able to spell \"beautiful\" if it's spelled as \"B-E-A-U-T-I-F-L\"\n\n### Response:\"Amy\" could be able to spell beautiful if it's spelt in this way.\n\n### Test-Driven Development\n- Below is an instruction.

For example: In the example given, total time= 8x(hours)= 24(hours)\n\nWhen x1+x2+x3 = 24(h)\n\nOr, x1+x2-2x3 = 2(h)\n\nx1 + 2x2 -2x3 = 8\n\nx1 + x1 + x3 = 21\n\nx1 = 9\n\nThen, total hours= 24\n\nCustomer count= x(h) = x1 = 9\n= 9(customers)\n\nAnswer: Ann, Becky and Julia work at the pharmacy for 8 hrs each for a total of 24 hrs.

{"text": "The first part of the input, \"John climbs 3\" states that he climbs 3 stairs. By analysing and using reasoning, we can know that he climbs 2 and 3 staircases and 6 as a whole. \nIn the next part, the input states that the number of stairs in the first step equals 20. This information helps us know that staircase no. 1 has 20 steps and the climber, John, climbs 3 steps. In essence, he climbs 3 and 20 steps on that step. That brings up to (3+20) = 23 steps for John on staircase 1.\nThe next part states that the number of steps in staircase no 2 is twice as much as that of the previous staircase. This implies that this staircase must have 2 times of staircase 1 - that is 46 steps. Thus, a total of 69 (23+23+46) steps are climbed by John on the 2 staircases together.\nThe final part states that staircase 3 has 10 fewer stairs than staircase 2. This implies that staircase 2 has 56 steps.\n\nThus John climbs a total of 6 staircases together which amount to 69 stairs. The number of feet climbed by him is therefore 6*(0.5) feet, which equals 34.5 feet.\n\nAnswer: 34.5 ft", "answer": " 45"}

{"text": "1. First, determine the information that is required from the statement of the problem.\n2. The first statement: \"... Wanda weighs 40 pounds more than  Yola currently.\" is the correct statement in the problem. It gives us an indication that whatever is being asked is a problem based on addition, i.e. Wanda weighs more than Yola in pounds.\n\n3. The second statement:... \"...Wanda also weighs more than  Yola did x years ago...\" also gives the idea that wharever we are being asked, whatever problem it is being framed on will involve one or more statements of the type \"*x years ago\", where x is likely to be 1 or 2 and not 3, 4, 5 etc.\n4. The third statement: \"... How much did Yola actually weigh 2 years  ago?\", indicates that whatever problem it is being asked will involve Yola's weight in pounds.\n5. The key to solving the given problem is to relate all the pieces of information given in the different statements. This can be done by observing that both Wanda's and Yola's weight are considered and in both the problems, Yola is weighter, i.e. weighs more than Wanda. Hence, Wanda weighs only 50 pounds less than Yola, which means that (Wanda - 50) + 2 yrs =... (Yola - 50), hence, Yola's weight 2 years ago is 170 pounds.\n\n```\nWanda x years ago - 50 = Yola x years ago\nWanda(2-x) = Yola(2-x)\nWanda = Yola *  2\nWanda =2* Yola\n```\n\nIn this case, Wanda's weight (220) has to be dived by 2 = Yola's weight. Hence, Yola's  weight 2 years ago 240 pounds. \n\nAnswer: Yola's weight two years ago = 240 pounds", "answer": " 170"}

The third letter of Bobby's last name is a \"y.\" Bobby is a boy. How old is Bobby?\n\n### Rationale: We use the information that is clearly provided to answer the question. By analyzing the choices we must use the information given to us and eliminate all choices that can be ruled out. \n\nThere are letters in the color blue, that is why Bobby's favorite color is given as blue rather than stating green or red. Therefore we can conclude, from the choices there are only blue and green in all the choices provided. \n\nUsing information we have read, the three letter word \"boy\" has to be the right choice in this scenario as the other options are either girls or don't have a third or fourth letter. \n\nTherefore the answer is **8**.", "answer": " 7"}

'Monkeys' could be a family who could have a group of 12 members, including both males and females.\nAlso, monkey's is a type of fun loving animals and have a tendency to get angry too, if disturbed.

So, each month he isn't playing baseball; he needs to work to cover his expenses. He earns $12 per hour which equates to $180 per month. \n\n3.`Roughly, to save $180 per months, he needs to earn $180. Since Gerald wants to save enough money to cover his monthly expenses, he first needs to find out how many money he needs to save. Answer: He needs to save $120 per months which equates to $600.\n\n4. Since, he can't work for 4 months to earn $600. Therefore, he can only rake 16 hours, shovel 8 hours and mow lawns 6 hours, which is $144 per months.\n\n5. Answer: At first, Gerald needs to save $600.

Here, Tara wants to buy expensive product which costs  $1000, and is making a $20 down payment, and paying in $65 installments.\n\n2. The last installment is not specified, so we assume it to be 4 months, thus there are 4 installments.\n\n3. We assume Tara did not pay extra $20 for down payment, as it wasn't necessary.\n\n4. According to the rules of the shop, Tara is making a 20% of $1000 down payment, which equals to $200.\n\n5. Thus, Tara needs to find out how much is going to be her last installment's balance, i.e. we are going to find out what her installments are, by subtracting the $200 down payment from $1000 total cost.\n\n6. By this way, it can be concluded that her total installments' cost will be $690 (i.e. 65*4), and the final installment's balance is going to be $130 (i.e $1000-$200-(4*$65)).\n\n7.

{"text": "Harry has 24 apples.\n\n### Rationale: To begin with, examine the first part of the question. \"Tim has 30...\" indicates that he has a number of apples equal to 30. To calculate Tim's number of apples, take his number of apples in the second part of the question.\n\n1. Harry's number of appled as \"half as many as\" Tim's number of apps. So \"5 as many as Tim has\" can be used as a shortcut (in the case of having \"as many as\" in the question). \"30\" x 5 is 150 and half of 150 is 75. \n\n2. Since \"Tim has 75\", \"75\" x 5 is \"375\", which means Harry has fewer number of apples than \"Tim has\". That's why the final rationale is \"Harry has 24 appels\".\n\n### Input 1: 276 people are present in a crowd. 57 of them are women. If 31% are women, what % of the people are men?\n### Response: 69%.\n\n### Rationales:\nFirst, we need to determine the percentage of women in the crowd.\n\n1. By process of elimination, it can be seen that choice E doesn't give a suitable answer i.e. 43% (57/133).\n\n2. Choice A says that \"31% are women\". This means that 13% (31/133) of the participants are women.\n\n3. Choice B has the most suitable answer that gives 31 as the percentage of female participants in the crowd. Thus, 31% is a suitable answer.\n    \nSo, the final conclusion is: \"31% women = 31 / 133 = 22.919% women. 69% men = 1 - 22.92 = 76.195% men.\" \n\n### Input : There are 4 boys and 5 girls in class 3-6.

The first step to this is to read the problem thoroughly and understand all the steps and directions it contains.\n\n3. There are three pieces of information that will aid the reader to understand the question better:\n\n  a. \"In a conference room,... chairs with a capacity... were arranged in rows in prep...\"\n\n  b. \"If 2/5... were not occupied...\"\n\n  c. \"and rest each had two people...\"\n\n4.

The second paragraph can be interpreted as, \"After the chairs in the conference room were arranged in rows, the attendance of the members was 5 chairs per member.

After applying the third piece of information, a simple interpretation could be, \"Let p be the number of members, then p=5.\"\n\n7. The question then asks us to find the number of members who did not attend the board meeting.\n\n8. To do so, we will have to plug in the number of members to the equation.\n\n9. This is because,\n\n10. We will also have to fill in the appropriate value for \"occupied\" so that we can compute the \"unoccupied\" cases.\n\n11.

To calculate the answer, we can consider 5 lion cubs are born per month (assuming the first month includes 5 lion cub births only). This would be roughly equal to 60 lion cubs born in 60 months (which is 5 * 60 = 300). So, the sum of lion births in the year would be 60 + 5*12 = 300 and the sum of the lion cubs deaths would be 1 * 60 = (1 * 60) = 60. \n\n4. By subtracting the lion deaths (60) from lion births (300), we get 240 lion cubs in a year. \n\nNote: The lion cubs born can be calculated as 5 * 6 =30 lion cubs per month and we can subtract 5 to get, the lion cub death: death of 30 will increase 60 so that, death by (60 -30) = 340. \n\n5) So, we can answer the question as the difference between lion births and lion death in the year (60 + 5 * 12 - 340 ) \n\nTherefore, we can conclude after one year, there are (60 + 240) lions will be alive and the answer to the question would be ((60 + 230)/12) lions.", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "By the given question, this task may need simple calculations to complete this task.\n\n##### Example Input: Bobby has 16 toys, and every year the number of toys he has increases by 16% each year. After how many years will the number of toys be equal to twenty?\n##### Solution:\n1. Let's first understand the question.\n2. First, add all the choices to find the total number of cars Bobby has now. This number can be calculated using the formula.\n            N(A) = N(a1*x) + N(a2*x) + N (a3*x), where N is total number of cars, and A is all the variables of the question. \n            (a1 = 16,  a2 = 50%, and  a3 = 3 years)\n       3. N (A) = 16*1.50 = 24 cars  So, Bobby's number of cars now is 24. \n       4. Now, divide both the sides by 24 to get rid of the percent,   (24/1.50) = 16. A, which is 16 cars\n       5. Now, multiply both the sides by 100 to get rid of the decimal form,    100*(16/1.50)=16 x 99.4, which is 1584 years. So, the number of years it takes to get 20 toys.\n       6.

For starters, if plates are 10.0, how can they be weighed at 30.0? Next, the wording states that the 10.0 plates weigh more as they are being dropped. But, this can mean they weigh more than they actually weigh as 10.0 since they are being dropped. What does this mean? It means that we have to consider that the question is not asking how much each plate weights. Instead, the wording is asking about how much each plate feels, not how much each one weighs.\n\n### Example Response:\nWhen asked how heavy the weights are as they are being dropped down to the floor, the implication is for the weights to stay the same weight. So, the weights would be 30.0 when they are dropped down to the floor. However, since they are dropped down to floor, and since they weigh 10.0 each when they are on a rack, they feel heavy at this point. The wording states to make the 10% heaviness, so that means we should not multiply each of the plates by 1.1 to account for. Instead, we can subtract 20% and arrive at the correct weight of 23.0 (rounded).\n\n### Demons:\n\n### Demoni Response:\nWhen Tom uses 10 weight plate each weighing 20 pounds, how heavy did the weights feel.\n\n### Response\nSince 20% of each weight is heavier on the lower portion of the lift, there will be an amount of the", "answer": " 360"}
{"text": "Rationales:\n\n1. Let 'x' be the time spent to search the parking lot. When we use x, we're just replacing the word \"Minutes\" in the title of the question.\n\n2. The input question begins by introducing a situation where \"Nate got lost looking...\" and we get the information about the number of rows in Sect. G and Section H.\n\n3. The input has introduced a unit of measure (time) and the goal of \"finding\" his car. We have been asked to answer this in \"how many minutes?\" So, we need to determine how long the search took.\n\n4. Let us try and simplify the wording of the question to get its logical meaning. So, \"walk past\" could actually mean \"cover\". In the input question, we are asked to \"cover every section\" which has 15 rows in Section G and 20 rows in Section H. Therefore, it is possible that by walking through every section x times, we may cover every section once and hence find the car.\n\n5. Let us use this information and simplify the answer by writing 15x + 20x = Rows to be done in Sect. G + Section H. So, the total count of Rows would be the summation of both sections which is x (the total number of rows walked). But, we already have information about the total number of rows walked in both the sections. So, it is easy for us to determine the number of minutes spent looking for his car which could be computed as 'x' - (summation of both sections, i.e) x/15 (Section G) + x/20 (Section H). \n\n6.

In this question, it is stated that employees work for 8 hours per day for 25 days a Month. \n\n4. FOURTH: We can also infer from the question that a total of 200 hours of work per month are being performed by employees for one month.\n\n5. FIFTH: We can determine how much should be spent on FICA Tax for one month. To determine this, we can refer to the wage rate of each employee as given in the question. The question states that the wage of a warehouse worker is $15/hour and Manager's wage is $20/hour (i.e., $1,750 for two of them). \n\n6. SIXTH: The question shows that Janet has to pay FICA taxes on the wage of four warehouse workers and two managers for one month only.\n\n7. SEVENTH: Therefore, we need to determine how much Janet has to pay as FICA tax to the government for her six employees.\n\n8. The total pay after FICA tax to be paid to the six employees for the month of ten working days would be $4,325. Since there are two categories of employees, managers and warehouse workers, the FICA tax amount for each. \n\n9. Hence, FICA tax for four warehouse employee and two managers is $3,52 for one month.\n10. ANSWER: According to this question, the total amount that Janet has to spend for the FICA tax in one month is $3,500.", "answer": " 22000"}

First, understand the basic premise of the problem. Two workers work at the construction site - one climbed a 3 0 feet ladder 20 times and the other climbed a ladder shorter than the first ladder 15 X times.\n\n2. The next step is to understand where the two workers work. They are both working at the same site; therefore, these people are probably working on the same project.\n\n3. The final step is finding out what's the total length to which all the ladders climbed by both the workers added?\n\nChoice of Methods:\n\nThree methods were considered to solve this problem.\n\n### Method 1: Subtraction Method\n\nKeaton climbed 20 times. Hence multiply with 30.\n\n| 20 x 30 = 600 feet|\n\nReece climbed 15 times. Hence multiply with the shorter ladder (4)\n| 15 x 4 = 60 feet|\n\nThe total is 660 feet for Reece and 660 feet in total.\n\n### Rationale for Method 1:\n\nFirst, add all the steps taken by both the workers in total - this is where subtraction comes into play, where we subtract the ladder length of 20 by the ladder length of Reece (4). We end up with 20 - 4, i.e., 16 feet, which isn't much, right? So, you don't necessarily need this method to solve the problem.\n\n## \n\n### Method2: Division Method\n\nTotal steps of Keaton =20\n\nTotal steps of Reece =15\n\nSo, Reece climbed 25% (15/20) of Keaton's steps.\n\nNext, Keaton's lad is height = 30 feet. \n\nSo, for 25% of Keaton", "answer": " 11880"}

{"text": "It should take him 4.96 hours to set the new record.\n\n### Explanation:To set the new record for most consecutive rope jumps, Mark will need to jump 54,068 times. Mark can do this 3 times every second and 24 times each minute. Since he jumps 3 times a second and he can jump 24 times, we get 3.6 in minutes, 252 seconds for every jump. Since he jumps every second, we have around 24 minutes per jump. 252 jumped every hour, and since there are 60 minutes in every hour, that accounts into around 4.33 hours. To meet the record of 54,036 jumps, he will have to jump rope for around 4.35 hours. But he wants to set a new record, so he has to set his limit a higher value than the current one.

{"text": "John drinks 12 ounces of a soda that has caffeine 250 mg/oz.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. What the question wants: We want to analyze the entire quantity of caffeine that John consumed, which can be the sum of 250gm + 150gm +150gm.\n\n2. What is being asked in the problem: The problem asks to find that quantity of caffeines John consumed.\n\n3. Analyzing the options: We will have to find the options that make us add up the quantities of caffeines that John drank.\n\n4. Let's pick the choice A:250 gm/oz is 2 drinks. It can be combined to answer this.\n\n5. Let's pick choice B: 150 gm for each 3 oz. So, it can be combined if we pick option C:150 gm/2.5 oz, that is, 60gm caffeines for 2.5 ounces.\n\n6. Choice D: 150gms/2.5 ounse can be combined with B which says 60 gms/2.5 ozs.\n\n7. Now, we have all the options combined. It means that we get a total of 310 gms of caffeine in each ounces of a drink, each of which weighs 2.5 ounce.\n\n8. Then, we have to sum up the quantities of cafeteries since we have to determine the quantity of cafeteries John consumed by multiplying the quantities of cafetieries to the volume.\n\n9. Therefore, caffeine consumed: 310 gm x 6 oz= 310 g m x 32= 310 x32= 10160 gms.\n\n### Submission Information:\n\n### What is this?\n\nExplanation: We are trying to find what the problem asks, which is \"How much caffeine does John consume?\".

There are 6 people going to trip and each person will have 5 bags. In total, that results in 30 bags. Each of these bags has to be within the restricted weight limit so it is 50 pounds maximum. Therefore, all 30 bags total to 1500 pounds. The question states that the plane itself can hold 6000. In this case, adding the bags to the plane itself, the plane can hold 7500. This means that the plane can hold 2500 more pounds of materials. If each person's luggage weighs 50 pounds, 2500 divided into 50 is 50 bags. This means that the airplane can carry a total of 90 bags.", "answer": " 90"}

For the big box, we can find a formula where there are a total of 2.5 times the number of green marble and $4 \\times 1.5$ times the number of red marbles. This gives the total as $157.5$.  A general formula for the total amount in the box is given as:\n$$ Totalnumberofmarbles = 4 \\times \\left(\\frac{greenmarbles}{4}\\right) + 4 \\times \\frac{redmarbles}{4} + 0.5 \\times \\left(\\left(\\frac{numberofgreenmarbles}{4} - \\frac{numberofredmarbles}{4}\\times 4\\right)\\times numberofgreenmarbles\\right)$$\n2. The box has three times the number of green than red marbles. Thus, subtracting $4$ times the number of green from the total tells us that red and green marbles are $4$ times the green marbles, making up $80\\%$ of the box.\n\n```\n3. Using the formula, we can say that $4$ times the blue marbles is $60$, and $4$ times the yellow marbles is $30$.\n\n```\n4. Subtracting $60$ from $157.3$ gives $97.30.$ Divide $97.3$ by $180$ and we get the answer as $0.5354$ or $30/60*3 =3$.\\[\\Therefore \\; \\color{red}{answer = 3}\\]", "answer": " 88"}

{"text": "### Rationale :\n1. The task is to calculate how many minutes will be needed to cover the rest of the exam in 50 minutes.\n\n2. The first step to solving the problem is to identify the quantity that needs to be calculated.\nIn this question, we are calculating how many minutes will be available if Jessica finishes the exam and covers the rest of it.\n\n3. The second step is to find out the relationships between variables present in the situation. For this question, we already have the variable of interest (Jessica's time remaining in minutes) in our scenario.\n\n4. After knowing the relationships, we have to find what is variable of interest, and all the other variables that are known. Variables are generally given in such a way to give an insight into the situation (e.g, when an hour is needed to cover an exam, the exam has 80 questions, then how many minutes will be used to take that exam...).\n\n5. Next, we need to find the unknown variables' values. We need to fill the unknowns with values such that the value that is to be calculated is obtained.\n\n\t6. Finally, we solve for the remaining variables using equation substitution. We can use the value given in the situation to substitute for it. So, when Jessica finishes answering 16 out of the 80 questions, we know that she has 12 minutes left to take the remaining 50 questions. We should substitute the time as the variable that we want to calculate the number of remaining min for.\nIn the process of finding the answer, we need to find how many remaining questions do you need to answer to use only 50 minutes to finish the 80 question exam. We can calculate this by dividing 50 by 80. This is because a math exam question is likely to take some fixed number of minutes to answer.\nFrom the question stem, we already know that Jessica is answering at the rate of 1 minute per 80 questions.

{"text": "There are 2400 imported wine bottles to start with. In addition, half as many bottles are imported as the number of bottles are imported (1:2) which means 1200 wine bottles are imported. For the guests drank, 1(3)/4th bottles are imported and remaining number are domestics wine bottles. When all bottles are consumed, we have 1(2)/3rd of imported bottles left in cellar (600/2400). But the 2400 number, 600 is multiplied by 2 and the remainder is divided by 2 to get the final answer. (1200*2=2400 remainder 1600/2=800), so the final answer would be 2400 - 800=1600.\n### Explanation:\nInput: Jose has 2400 of imported wine bottles. After guests drink one-third (33.33%) of all wine (half are imported, one-third = 1(3:2) = 1666.6666\u2026\u2026.), the remainder in case are 600 of imported bottles and 800 of domestics bottles.\n\nOutput: We have (2400-600)/3 = 1166.66\u2026\u2026..(remainder) and the remaining 800 which is remainder for the case divided by 2 since it must be whole number, we get 400 bottles.\nOutput: (2400 -600)/3=1166.7\u2026\u2026and after we take remainder 400 / 2 = 200.

Here, we can assume that sweet apples = 75% and sour apples = 25%. Sweet apples are the primary source of revenue, as they are sold at $.5 per apple, while sour apples fetch $.1 per apple. This gives us a general idea that he would make $40 every month but it may not.

{"text": "For James to know how much he is out of pocket for all the products he bought from Amazon, his expenses should be calculated. \n\n1. To do so, we should first solve for the total cost of what James purchased from Amazon. We can note that James returned a TV which cost $700. So, the new total cost for what he purchased before returning the TV is $3,000 - $700 = $2,300.\n\n2. Now, we should focus on the purchase of the bike, a toaster, and the return of another bike. For the bike, James' original purchase was $3,003,000 and the return value for the bike is $2000. Hence, the new total cost of bikes would be $2,000 + $2,003,200 - 2000 = $2700.\n\n3. We can calculate the total price of the item for the return of what he purchased for himself by simply subtracting the price of the toaster ($100) from the price of the toasted item i.e $2700 - $100 = $2600.\n\n4. Therefore, the total value of James' purchase from Amazon is 2703.00 + 2600 = 5303.00.\n\n5. Hence by solving for the purchase price of James and subtracting the expenses from it, we get that he is $5303.50 in the red. \n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following grade math equation\n\nDemostration:\n\nInput 1: a + b = 25 \n\na: 8\n\nb:  17\n\nOutput: a + b =25\n\nRationales:\n\n1) At first, we should understand what's being asked in the question, which is to determine the sum of two values.\n\n2) After that, we should understand what the given values are and what they equate to as whole numbers, i.e., 8 and 17 respectively, with respect to the given equation.\n\n3) Here, we can then write down what the output of the equation is as a whole number", "answer": " 2020"}

In the question, we see the number of candies as the common variables, so we have information about \"yellow candies\" and \"red candies\", but the other quantities are irrelevant, so discard them immediately.\n\n1. In A: the number of red candies is unknown, so discard \"four times as many yellow candied\".\n\n2. In B: the number of blue candies isn't required.\n\n3. In C: the number of candies is 20 candies less than three times as much as yellow. However, this information doesn't help us in solving the problem. So, discard it. \n\n4.In D: 40 red + 20 less than 3 times red + half blue - yellow + yellow = 40 - 20 + 16. Hence, we have the relation:  \"16 = 40 -20 + 1/2 (40 -20) - 5\"\n\n5.

Understand what is being asked in regards to the question. In this question, we are required to figure out the number of biscuits that are able to be made with a certain dough sheet of a certain size. \n\n2. Analyze the size of the dough. First off, we can see that the length and width of dough is 12 inches. Then, divide 12 by two to get 6. Then multiply 3 by 6 and we get a total of 18. Therefore, we can find out that Unique will be able to make 18 biscuits with the dough sheet. \n\n31. Analyze the length and width of a biscuit. In the question, the length and width is mentioned twice which could be very confusing. To understand this better, divide 3 by two to get 1.5, then multiply this times the width 12 to get a total of 2, which would also be the same for for the length. Then, multiply 1.5 by 1.5 to get a total of two and a half. Now, we can subtract the length by the width, since we know that they are equal, to get 1. So, now we have a total of 1 that goes with the width and length of a single biscuit. \n\n4. Analyze size of each biscui and multiply by 1.5: The length and width of the biscuits is mentioned as 3 by 3, or 9 inches. For this, we divide 9 by two to get 4 five eights, and again to get half. Then, multiply 4 five eights by half", "answer": " 16"}

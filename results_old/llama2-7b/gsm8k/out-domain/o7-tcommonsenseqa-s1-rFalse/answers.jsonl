Each night there will be 5 room, but the students won't all sleep that night.  So, if 15 would be able to sleep during the 100 nights, 15 nights will be spent on each bed and couch in each room.  So, 2 will be spent sleeping in a bed and 1 will be spent sleeping on the couch.  So, 15 night will be spent in a bed or couch by each student.  If the room is 2 beds, then 1 night out of 10 nights will be spent sleeping.  Each night there is 2 * 1 night on each bed.  So, 5 rooms will need to be given out.", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "The answer here would be C: 9 tires.\n\n### Input/Response:\nA young woman visits a bookstore and plans to purchase a book, a movie, and a novelty item. The book and movie are sold at the same price and must be taken without damage. She also plans to spend at least 75% of her money on these two items if possible. If she must spend less than 75% on these two items, she will spend what is left on the novelty item. She has a $35 budget. How much is probably available for the novelty item?\nThe book costs $15, the movie costs $12, and the novelty item costs $5.  This is the problem with the young woman.  If she does not want to spend less than 76.3% of her money, she can spend 1/3 of her money on the book and movie (or $15 + $12).  From that she gets $27 left to spend on the novelty item (1/3 * amount of money remaining after 75%, which is 3/4).  $5.17 + the amount of her 75% (3/4, which is 0.75) she spent on the book and movie = $5.17, which is the amount she can use at her leisure on the novelty item, which is the bookstore's profit.\n### Discussion:\nHow did you solve this problem?

I was to do the math problem in 5 hours and 15 minutes of time. That is because at 5 hours and 0 minutes, I ride for a quarter of time. At that point, I can use 40 minutes. That means I divide the minutes I ride for by the amount of time that it takes me to ride for a quarter of its time. In doing that, I end up with 10, since you have one quarter of a half hour.

The cow leaps 7 feet high and crashes through the top passenger window of the truck's compartment, killing the two men inside. Then the cow is hit by the lion, which crashes through the trailer and eats the cow, leaving the cow carcass on the pavement. Later on, a motorcyclist comes through the intersection and sees an open window and an easy meal. The motorcyclist drives through the window and grabs the cow carcass, taking it off to a nearby farm, where he leaves the carcass. Soon, some farmers show up to move their horse-drawn plow and see the cow carcass there. The two of them move it out of the way and proceed to farm, when one of the farmers steps in the cow carcass and accidentally breaks his leg. He goes to a hospital and receives an x-ray, after which the orthopedic surgeon who took over from Andy walks through the hospital lobby and sees the x-ray machine.

The retail price is 75 cents for 52 cents worth of milk, and 25 cents for a can of soda that's worth $2.50. \n\n### What should be the correct response?\nAn answer that is correct is  $8\n\n### Explain: The store owner buys clothes from a clothing manufacturer for $12 for a pair of pant and add 80% to it, then the retail price would be $16 for a pair of pantalones. The owner would make $16-12 = $4.\nIn the next question, if the owner's profit margin is 40%, then the owner would make $4 *.4 = $1.6 on the sale of 1 pair of pant and $1.6 on 2 pair of pants.\n\n### Answer:\nIf the store owner will pay 40% of the retail price as his profit, and he will buy the wholesale price for $11 then the profit is $16-11 =$5 \nSo his profit percentage for a pair of pantomes is 50%, so his gross revenue for 1 pair of panticlothes is $16 and $32 for two pair of pant.\nThen $32 for two pants will gross $64 and to 64 is x and 48 to x = $160\nSo the answer is $160.", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "The average age of the three is 18 years and 5 months.\n\n### Explanation: Using the knowledge found in the previous answers. Omi is twice as old is Kimiko Kimiko is already 28 years old. So, Kimiko must be 14 years old. So, KImiko is 56/2 -14 = 32 years and arlett is 3/4 arlett's age, which is 91/4(age of arlette) = 91/4*32 = 19 years and 7 months old for Arlette. so, the total combined age would be (28+14+19+7 months = 69 and remainder 12.666666 = 70 years old. So, 70 divided by 3 = 23 months old to be added to each persons age for 2/3 is 1+2/3=6 months + 2+1/3 = 10 months + 1+1/3 =13 months = 1+1/2= 10 months and 10+1 = 11 months to Kimiko added = (14 years +11 months= 25 years 6 months old to Omi. So, 25+14 (Kimiko) +19 + 11(Omi) = 59 years old.) So, divide the sum by 5, 60 divided by 5 = 10.80000 = 11 years and 5 months old.)So, to find the average age of the 3, we need to take all the individual ages and divide by 3 and then the remainder is the average. Using the formula: (11+32+19+10+59)/3, we will get (96)/3= 32 (remainder =12 and we must add this value to the 1/3(12 = 3+1/3= 4 years old to each person and add these ages together: 3+14+11+25+15 = 89+1= 90 years old.

With only 18 total cuprs, if this is used to make\none drink this leaves 17 1/4 cups of tea and lemonade left over. The\nremaining cups of tea and drink left over are in 4 cups of each.\n\n### Output:\n\nCups of lemonade remaining are 6.25 cups\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIn the example, we only have 18 cups of tea and lemonaid. If we use 1/4 of\na cup of tea and 1 1/4 cuprs of lemonade to create one serving, we only have 7\ncups worth of lemonade and tea left over. If we subtract 7 from the initial\ntotal cups, we are left with (18 - 7) = 11 cups. If we divide 11 into the\nnumber of teas and lemonaid, we get 11/1/4 which is equivalent to 1 1/2 cups of\nlemonaid and tea. From there, we can use the remainder (4) to count it as 1\nfor each cup so there are 4 servings of lemonade for each cup of lemonade\nremaining.", "answer": " 15"}

If I had to explain why 6x7 was not being used, I would say that it would take 1 extra step. Since you needed to make sure that 6x7 was a number that fits in your equation you had to take 7x6. Since you know that you have to make sure that these numbers fit in your equation, multiplying six times 7 would be faster. In this case, there are 7 steps to solving the example.\n\nOne way that I can see that this is important is that I did not think about the multiplication side of the problem as far as doing it that way, because the multiplication in most problems does not have to go that way. It is not always necessary to take a step that has less work involved with the end result being the same. Since there are multiple ways to do the same process, it is important that you know all of the options of how to work out an equation.

We know how many miles he covers by running but we only care about the total number of yards so we subtract the number of miles covered swimming by 90 - 2 = 88 miles. The run took 90 minutes with the last hour at 4 times the regular speed and running for an hour so 1/4 of that means 1/12 so we multiply by 1/12 which means that the man ran for 23 and a half miles. One mile is equal 2000 yards. So in the last hour he runs for 23.5 thousand miles which equals to 23500 yards. When we add back the 2000 for the swim we have 23501 which rounded up to the nearest whole number is 23502. This means that he swims a total of 977 miles or 153555.6 yards. When we subtract 977 from 2350 we get 13523.4 which is 23512.4 which is 124.4. Multiplying by 124 then results in 16,061.44 or 16061 yards.\n\n### Input\nSam and Alex are moving as fast as a snail.

Here is her age: Anna = 30\n\n### Input   :If Josh's age when he married Anna added to her age 30 years ago is equal to their combined ages 30 years from now, what should Anna do?\n\n###Response: Anna should marry Josh because with that math that is exactly what would happen in a relationship with a couple that has been together as long as Josh and Anna have. In Josh and Anna, their ages are exactly the same, while in my relationship for example their ages are off by 3 years, so he is closer to 40 so it shows that Anna is happier than she has ever been.  \n\n### Input    : If the woman is from the UK and she is married to the man then it should also show she would happily stay with a man after she got divorced if he is now 35.\n\n###Response\nThe marriage of a man and a woman is special in the United States, if the woman is from the United Kingdom and the man is from the United Kingdom then the relationship would be strong and long.

You can't drink while you're driving because it would cause accidents. People will get hurt because of this. If you drink in your car you risk dying on the spot because alcohol levels are in your breath and can't go any faster than that. So if you think if you drink fast enough you'll lose your breath fast enough to stop driving on the spot, but with the police, you won't be able to do it that well unless you can drink 3 times as fast and you'll get arrested.

This does benefit our community in that the colors can be seen easier at night when there is a lack of light elsewhere. However, the same could be said for a green-blue color scheme on the road, as there is currently no other colors in use in the surrounding area. In addition, there has been several cases of fatalities where people have turned onto a road that was painted a different color, that is, green versus blue. It would be helpful for the town to implement a change like this, as it would prevent these kinds of accidents, prevent loss of life as well as promote a healthier traffic flow through our streets.Thank you, James\n\n### Input\n\n```python\n#import requests lib\n\n#get response from api, and store that in response variable\nr = requests.request(method = 'GET', url = 'https://random.lol/?type=answer&prompt=Question:The man walked down a street which had a row of white buildings, one after the other.

After subtracting the additional snow from the first day and fourth day, the final length of the snowdrift was found to be 10 inches.  Therefore, the snowdrift measured 10 inches tall at the end of the second day, then rose in height an additional 18 inches with the additional snowfall from the third day and the total snowfall on the second day.

Which brand do you think is the best value if John wants to buy 122 cards and wants as little change as possible?\n\n### Demostration:\n\nAs you can see from the table given below, \"The Munsters cards\" will give John the most card count as compared to price, which is 322 cards for $1.94 which is $0.08 cheaper than Wizard of Oz which is 296 cards for $2.36 which is 0.24 cents.\n\n|        No. of cards                                     |  No. of Decks   | Price                                                                                                  |  Change for card  |  Change for Deck\n|---------------------------------------------------------:| :-------------------:|  :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "answer": " 200"}
{"text": "It would take 35.59 seconds for a cheetah to catch up to a fleet-footed gazelle.\n\n### Input:-210 + 32 = -178\n\n### Response:-178\n\n\n### Demostration:\n\n#### Step #1:\n\n#### Step#2:In the first step, we identified a problem, and came up with a request for a given person/group. The second step is where we use \"if\" and \"else\" to give our algorithm a branch like structure. The first is the conditional, the part that looks like: \"if( (something) < 35 \" and the else part is what will happen if the answer is either greater or equal than 35.  The syntax is just like a boolean statement like \"myName =  (something) <= 35\". The if's condition is the first part of the if statement, and a boolean expression which checks if the result of the expression is less than 35, where as the else expression is just the inverse which would be >= 35.  Another way to think of it is to think of the conditional statement as \"if I know this to be true\", and the else statement would be \"then do this\".  With this, we will be able to determine how to process a number.  We should follow some rules when coding though. Always put comments so you can clearly understand what the code is doing.  Also, I tend to give my variables generic names so they're easier to understand.  This way if the else statement contains a statement that goes \"someVariable = 5,\" which is how we want the user to respond in the else statement, you know it will be a number that doesn't equal 5. \n\n#### Step #2:\n\n#### Step3:In the third step, I use the user input to determine an answer.  With a if statement and an else statement. If the answer is less than 30, the answer is a negative number (because you don't know if the number is negative or positive, the number could be -3, and you want to return it as a negative number) so return -answer. Elseif, the user input is greater than or equal to 30, you would return a positive answer.  This is good practice for determining logic when people are confused", "answer": " 7"}

Test your function and it has to return the answer\n\n### How did we make it work?\n\nThe function takes the string (the question) and the string (the answer). `answer` will be split into two. Then the function will take the first string and find the \" \" (space) character (first parameter of `indexOf()`) and subtract `1`. So we will then have \"a: oil refineries\" and the second parameter is the string to search for, and the third is the starting character. When `indexOf` returns `0`, it means there is nothing to compare because no `space` character was found, so the function returns the whole string. Otherwise, we will have the index of the first `space` character, we take that number and subtract `1`. After that, we check if the number we have is above zero or not. If is negative we will then have a string longer than the input. In this case, we need to subtract the input string by one. We repeat the process until the number is higher than or equal to the string length and return the answer.\n\n### Credits:\n\n### Nastasios", "answer": " 27"}

Out of the pay, they paid for the materials used and deducted the total cost of the project, in order to raise enough funds to pay the remainder of the bill. When the amount was given to the client, what was the overall cost of the project?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput:The total price of the project cost $150,000.00 and took around 150,033 hours to finish. There were 12 months during which the people worked on the project, so that's around 1000 hours per month. The total time spent working totalled to 120,033, or 120,330 minutes. At the rate of 1000, they would have a minimum of 20,030 or max of 22,030 hours used for work.

The pine trees were the closest source of wood. But the truck can hold only six pieces of wood, which is not enough for a one-piece board. \n\n1.\tHow can they make the board?\n\n2.\tHow much wood would be needed for it?\n\n3.\tWould it be cheaper to make half a board? Explain.\n\n4.\tWould it make a difference if they could take all the wood in one piece out of the tree trunks? Explain.\n#### Demonstration\nThe carpenters should use glue to join the pieces of the board. Each six pieces would also need six pieces of wood to glue, for a total of 96 pieces of wood. To make it easier to work with the wood, they can cut each piece to half its length. For the length of the board, they will still need 6 pieces of wood. The total amount of wood they will need in the end for the board, is 120 pieces.\n\nThere has to be a point where it is cheaper to make more than one board of half its length. The carpenters should make the board of one-quarter length first. They cut that board and join it with the other two boards of half its length together. This way, they will save money, and the wood will not be wasted. The total amount of money they spend after making the board is 108. The cheapest way to make the board would be to use 6 pieces of wood instead of 12 pieces. \n\nIf they could take all the pieces of wood from a tree trunk with one go and avoid cutting them with a saw, they probably would need a lot fewer wood.\n\n### Input\nWhat are the three types of variables?\n\n### Demostration\nA number that is not subject to change is the constant. \n\nThe variable that is used to record observations about the same event more than once is called the dependent variable. \n\nWhen the variable is changed through an experiment, it is called the explanatory variable.", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "How can I help?\n\n### Explanation:When given the challenge of solving this problem, think about what information you know.\n\n* Samantha: 3 lower letters than Bobbie\n* Bobbie: 3 letters of Bobbie's last name, twice as long as Jamie's \n* Jamie: Jamie's last name is Jamie Grey\nThis combination of information can be rephrased as this: A letter in Samantha\u2019[s last name is twice that of Jamie as a letter in Bobbie\u2019s last names is 3 less than Samantha\u2019s.\n\n* If Bobbie took two of her letters off her last name then her last name is twice as long as Jamies. From Samantha\u2019s information, a letter that is in her last name will half as long as a letter in two from Bobbie\u2019s lasted name.\n* Using this information, the letters in Bobbie\u2019s name and the length of Jamies name is all that is needed to calculate Samantha\u2019s  number of letters. \n\n* In Bobbie\u2019s name, the letters in Bobbi\u2019s name and 1 letter from Jamies.\n\n* In Bobbi\u2019s name, the length of Bobbie\u2019s name plus length of the letters from Jamies\n\n* Bobbi\u2019s last name has 5 letters. \n\nSo we have: \n\n* 3 letters that are half the length of the longest of Jamie's letters\n\n* 5 letters that are 3 times the length of Jamies single letter.\n\nThis leaves the 4th of Bobbie\u2019s letters that has the same length as Jamies 1st 2 letters plus the length of Bobbie's name is twice as long \n\nUsing this information on the 4'th letter of Bobbie\u2019s long name and that the 5th letter is 3 times as long as the other 4, the 4th and 5th letters must be E as E is the name of Bobbie\u2019s last \n\nFrom this we know that 3/13 letters are present in Bobbie\u2019s long last name so the  number of letters in Samantha's last name is 3/12 letters. This is because the 13th letter is in Jamies name.", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "### Explanation:\nFirst, since Roselyn gave Mara three times as much, that means she gave Mara 3x as many. Roselyn gave Maral 60 books, which means she had 60 books left in all. Roselyn gave Rebecca 10 books more than Maral, because she gave Mara 60 books, and kept with 60, Rebecca received 50 books. Since Roselyn kept 60, and gave Maral and Rebecca 60 then Roselyn had 100 books left over, which means 3x as much as the 10 books. Roselyn had 60 books, so she now had 6x as much as the original 10 books (65 books). Roselyn then left 60 with 65 + some extra, Roselyn had 75 books.

You can't have 50 buyers with only 3 days in a row, so you start with the day before and say that there were only 50 buyers the day before. \n\nYou can't subtract from 50. To solve this we'll have to make some assumptions. \n\nWe can assume that there were no buyers for the first day. Say that there was a 50% chance there was a buyer or not. We can also assume that each day has a 1/40 chance of being the first day, multiplied by 1/30, etc. so the probability of a visitor being on a specific day is equal to (3/50)*(3/50).\n\nThere is a 50% possibility of a visitor each day, so the probability will total 1/50 on the day before, and 1/30 on the day before the day before, and so on. \n\nThe sum of those probabilities is 1, so 1/50+(1/30)+(1/30)+... + (1/50)= 1/50*(40), meaning that the probability of a visitor is 1/(40)=1/20 and hence 20 total buyers in 3 days.", "answer": " 140"}

We start filling this with water at 2 liters per minute and when it reaches the 125 cm mark the ice starts to freeze which will reduce the flow of water.  Once it freezes the entire 125 cm the flow will slow to 1 liter per minute and stay that way until it has all frozen.  It will take 60 minutes to freeze all the way.  However, once it freezes it takes 66 minutes to melt all the way, which is 44 minutes more than it took to freeze.  This means the water will stay in the spout 24 minutes longer than it took to freeeze.  44 minutes for the water to melt would take 9.8 liters of water and 2 liters per hour would take about the same for half of that, which is 4.9 liters per hour.  If we divide 125 by 4.9 we get about 25.4 liters.\n\n\n### Instructions:\n\nDemonstrate the output of this problem by setting up your response in a form similar to this.\n\n\n## Hints:\n\n\n1) For each input, create an empty paragraph and begin writing a response by describing a mathematical scenario.

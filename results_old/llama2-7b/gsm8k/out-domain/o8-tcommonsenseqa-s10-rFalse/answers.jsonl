I'm not sure what grade it is referring to. If we do go with the idea that this is grade is a grade in some college level course, the grade is a score or a mark given to a student. So, you can't get a grade above 100%. I'd say the grade is a B since the options given are between A to E and a B is the lowest grade that's given. The options given for the \"which grade is higher\" option are:A is the grade that is higher that a 5.

{"text": "The correct answer is 388 books because for:60% of these 2300 books = 1420 only 60% = 846 books were published in the same country. Since 80% of the books are in English then 846 books that were published in the country were in English and only 79% of these 846 books are English language books which means there are 667 English-language books published in the same country, next we multiply them by 2 which is the total amount of books and get 1334 books. Since 1334 times.80 is way higher than the total of the books in the school library then we subtract that from our total and we get 1134 books.

{"text": "In a compound, the total number of dogs plus cats plus frogs must be equal to the total number of animals in the compound. (160 + 48 = 208) Since the number of dogs plus the number of cats equals the number of frogs plus 208 we can rewrite:\n\n(160 + 208) = (48+160)\n\nIn the second equation, we can rearrange 208 in the denominator and use the distributive property to get a simplified form of the third equation. Notice we can rewrite the variable for the number of frogs. We can say x = (160+60) so now we can remove the variable from the equation altogether. So we get x= 228\n\nSo the total number of animals is: \n(160+48)+(48 + 48) = Total number of animals =  (160+40) = 200\n\nAnd since there are twice that number of frogs in the compound, there is another 100 frogs!\n\n### Input:\"The square footage of your house.\"\n\n### Response:\"The number of square feet of your house.\"", "answer": " 304"}

My initial assumption was this was what they originally meant to ask, they just forgot the word 11.\n\nIf they had 5 pounds of bread that would mean they would make 4 loaves with 5 pounds of flour.

{"text": "The answer is 4 key chains\n\n### Justification:\nWe have $50 and we have to buy 4 pieces of key chains, so first we have to buy at a rate of 4. We have a total of $50, so we can buy 4 times $1, which means $4, so $4 x 4 is equal to $16. $4 for each item, so this means to bring it to $50 we have to buy 2 more items. So we can buy 2 times $1, which is $2.\n\n### Demo:\nThe key chains are of value $2 each, but the other stuff is more expensive or has value more than $2, so we have to buy 1 for $2, and 1 more for $8\nSo 1 + 1 = 2, we are missing 2. So buy 2 more items, and so you would buy 2 at $8 and 2 at $4 each.\nSo you are making the total $8 + 4 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20, then 20 is less that 49, means you can buy 2 more items to make 2 and 4, so your next total will be 20 + 22 = 42, means you can buy more.\n\n\n### How to approach (Solution Technique):", "answer": " 21"}

The rule for starting is the same as the rule for ending a round: Each person is asked to do only as many sit-ups as the difference in the number of sit-ups the two people did in the previous round. After the couple does 20 sit-ups, the husband is told to do how many sit-ups more than the wife did in the last round.\n\n### Response2: The answer is 14; the number of sit-outs the husband will have to perform if they both did a total of 20. The original numbers were 6 for the husband and 8 for the wife, and after the first round of 20 sit-outs, the wife did 2 and the husband did 8.

{"text": "The distance of Veronica's flash light to Freddie's flash light is 1000 + 1000/3, therefore from this we should have 1076 feet. Velma's flash light was seen at a distance of 1200 feet less than five times farther than Freddy's flash light. So 1200/5 = 240, so 1200-240 = 960 feet. Therefore Velma's flash will be seen at a distance of approximately 2990 feet. As for Veronica we have 1070 feet. In the end it's approximately Veronica's flash will be 1070 - 2990 = -1920 feet. So we multiply it by 2 which is a factor of Veronica's light; 1920 * 2 = -3842 feet from Veronica's light in the opposing direction. The answer is approximately -3842.\n\n### Input :  A man who was 1 foot 2 inches tall and weighing 260 pounds was riding in a 13-foot-long boat with a 6-foot-radius. When the man and boat were on the shore, there were 4 feet \nof water under the boat.

This years sales they sold 53 for small children, 35 older kids, 75 adults, and 37 seniors! To figure out how many omelettes they need to buy, they estimate a kid can eat 1 omelette, elder can eat 1 omeelette, adult will eat two, and seniors will only eat 1/2! Since they are being safe and getting enough omelet just in case people eat more, they will get 25 extra eggs. They will use 2 eggs for every 1 omelette. To get to their answer, multiply the price level by how much the person/can eat. Then add those times by 2. Since there are 4 levels, you would do 25 x 1 x 1/2 =62.5 eggs. But the person needs 2 eggs for every omelette. You will do 25 eggs for each 1/2 omelette.

{"text": "To start, the days should be multiplied by 8 or 8 hours. So if someone uses 7 days in a year, that person would have 7 * 8 = 56 hours = 2.52 days worth of days. If they use 8 days in a year, they would have 8 *8 = 64 hours = 3.00 days. To start, you must multiply everything by 8. Then, each day is 8 hours long, and each sick day is 10. Then, each vacation day is 8 * 10 = 80.\n\nSo an employee using 10 sick days in a year would be equal to a sick vacation = (10 * 8) = 80. An employee using 5 sick days in a year = 5 * 8 = 40. An employee using half his sick vacation is 5 * 8 / 2 = 20.\n\nSo let's say you are an employee with 100 sick days in a school year. That number is 100 * 8 and since we know that 8 is 10, to find the answer the answer can be found like this: (100 * 10) * 8 * 8 = 16,000.\n\n### Input :\nLet's say a restaurant has several employees that worked for the same amount of time.\nOne employee worked there for\n 7\ny\nhours\n,\nanother one worked\n 6\nhours,\nand\n 5\n employees worked there\n\n### Response :\nTo start, you should find the total amount of hours the worked.

{"text": "The answer to this question is $103.1250 which is the amount of pay he earns per overtime hours that he works. This is because he worked 72 overtime hours, meaning that he actually worked 114 hours. He normally earns 12, or dollar 48 every 60 minutes. Therefore, he has earned 21 times $48 (the first 48 times) meaning that he has earned $984. To make the equation more clear, $984 x 5.00 is equal to $4920. Therefore, this is the first multiplicative operation performed on the two expressions. Afterwards, multiply $4920 by 1.60 which is the normal price per hr. To make this calculation more clear, the answer is 78320 + $299.

While there are many examples of excessive loss in daily life, in this problem, we will only present one of them which involves the loss of a car. If a person had a new car and wanted to increase its value, so he has decided to take all the accessories and change those accessories for high-quality accessories so that the car value can increase many times when he sells it in the future. What I mentioned before is the excessive car loss which is done by many people all over the world. This process may be useful for people who are trying to increase the value of a car in the future, and I could say that it is not a good action to do. This excessive loss may happen to a person whenever he tries to increase the amount of value of an asset just to increase its value. It is better for him to do the action gradually and carefully.\n\n### Answer:\nThe person took a car from his home and went for changing it to another car. After some time he had a new car, and what he did on his old car which is taking the accessories and putting high-quality accessories instead of his old accessories. That means his old accessories are not the accessories of his new car and also his old car is not anymore on the way where he left it. That is excessive loss.\n\n#### Bigger than Life\nI consider a story bigger than life when it includes a life challenge, a life goal, or a life story that involves someone facing a challenge.

{"text": "### Input\n\nYou can't really have 0/0, so Gracie is 78 inches tall.\n\n### Output\n\nGracie is 75 inches \n\n### Demostration\n\nIn this section, the prompt describes a person, Gracie, who is 7 inches shorter than her boyfriend, Grayson. Grayson is 2 inches taller then Griffin. Griffin, who is 76 inches tall, is Gracie's boyfriend.\n\n### Solution\n\nGracie and Grayson have to be equal length apart except for Grayson. In general, the formula from math for the height of someone being x feet short of someone of height y, would be (y-x), which is (72-78) which is 25 inches.\n\nGrayson had 2 more inches, so you multiply both sides by 2 to end up with Gracie having 50 inches. Griffin was 250+50=300 inches tall, which means that Gracie is 25-300=275 inches. When you use the 2 digit math, 6 tens becomes 7 tens, which you add 51 to get 86 5 tens. 7 tens means an addition of 10 so you would get 76. 86+29 is 116, so that Gracie is the person that is 115 inches tall.

{"text": "The answer of this answer should be 445\n\n### Justification:\nThis answer can be made in 2 ways:\n\n> 445 = 58 + 59 + 51 + 31\n\n> 4 = 43 + 8\n\nYou can see that the second equation has more steps, with more information, but the first equation produces 445.\n\n### Justify:\nThis is why I think this answer can be produced in this way:\n\nWe start by using this information: \n```\nTotal spots on each level = 100\nSpots filled on each level = Open spaces - 58\nFull spots in the garage = Total spots - Open Spaces \n```\nWe then set up a system:\n```\nOpen Spaces = 4 - 58 - x( 59 - 43) - y(51 - 8) - z(31 - 31) - xy - xz - yz\n```\nWe know that x + y + z = 0 in this case, and we also know that there will be 1 less of each x, y, and z, so we have:\n```\n2x + 2y + 2z = 0\n\n2(20 - 58) + 2(59 - 44) + 2(43 - 44) = 0\n\n44 + 2(58) + 8 = 0\n\n 58 = 0\n```\nGiven that information, we also know that there are 2(58), or 116 more open spaces than taken. If we then add that to the 100 from the last row of the chart we have:\n``` \n100 + 116 = 216\n```\nIf we subtract a portion of the first line of the chart 4 times, we get the result of 412 we are trying to find:\n```\n\n100 - 58 - 59 = 3\n3 - 43 = 1\n19 - 4 = 15\n12 - 8 = 4\n\n216 - (15 + 1 +", "answer": " 186"}

{"text": "Jerry's two daughters play soft ball on different teams. They have 8 games. I assume it\u2019s same number days per week. I'll give you a hint about an assumption. I'll use it for both answers. This field only has 8 hours in a day. It wastes less than an hour each game. So, it only takes up less than half of the day when they both play their games. They practice 4 hours for their team. They all have 2 hours game. If Jerry is at home and watch their game then it should be 2 hours that too. It means that it should be 12 hours. You should remember that you can't be at two places at the same time. So, when both sister is playing game at one time you need to find out how many games there is to see you daughter play the game and then spend 12 hours divided by that number in the field.  This means that they play their games at different times and for different teams. They also have 4 hours in a practice too except when they both don't play the same game. Practice happens the same way for two hours. This is only 2 games in a week. They both play 8 games each week except when they both are on the same team and play. In that case they play 2 game one for each of them. If they play 2 game while they are in the same team there is only one game day because it takes each one 2 hours. If both play in the same team and one of their game is in daytime and other is in night time on the same day then they only play 2 games on that day because it take each one 2 hours to play it. It means that when they play on the same team there only one game day. They all have 3 games on Sunday. It means that they play Sunday too. That's one game per weekday and Sunday game. It should be 1 game per team 4 games per each daughter. That's 12 games per week. It means that there is total of 24 game day.

You must first know the two properties of median in data set before you can use it.\nFirst, a median is a score that separates your data into two equal groups. Second, the median is the\nnumber that is in the middle of your data set. In this article, I will show you how to find the\nmedian for given data in one variable. Also, I will show you where you could use median in the real-\nworld. Finally, I will show you a real-life and a mathematical example on how to find median.\n### Response- Finding the median of numbers is a fundamental skill in math. When you can find the\nmedian easily, you can apply this skill to real life. When we talk about median, we will talk about\nthe middle number in any data set. In other words, this is the average of the middle half of any set\nof numbers. Let's find the median of the following data: 9, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 12, 17, 13, 18. Find the\nmiddle number that is equal to half of each number in our set. This means, we are looking for the\n14th number, 13, to find the median. That's all you need to know.\n\n### Examples:\n\n### Input:- What is your favorite type of weather?\n\n### Repons-Rain\n\n### Explinations:\nInput: \"What is your favorite type of the weather?\"\nAnswer: A: Rain\n\nInput:\nWhat kind of weather do you like?\nAnswer: A: Snow\n\nInput: What type of weather has the same color every day?\nAnswer: B: cloudy\n### Input: How many inches of rain fell in 2016?\n\nAnswer: A: 32 in.", "answer": " 20"}

His coworker, Mark, recommends that Ryan contact a licensed insurance broker about insuring his family. \n\n\"So, my coworker is recommending that I should get an insurance broker, but I'm not sure what that is. Can you explain?\" \n\n### Response:\"Sure! An insurance broker is someone who has a lot of knowledge about the different types of health insurance available on the market. They know what plans are available and the advantages/disadvantages of each plan.\n\nWhen an agent recommends a plan, it's because they think that will be the least expensive plan that meets the consumer's needs.\n\nBrokers and agents are often employed by large insurance companies. They can also be compensated in different ways. They can either be paid commission based on the enrollment levels they achieve, or they can be paid a salary plus bonus.\n\n**What type of insurance brokers are there?** \n\nA broker is a licensed expert in a lot of different types of insurance. They may be an expert in cars, or renters or homeowners insurance.\n\nAgents know about many different types of insurances, but not all of them in depth.\n\n**What you need to know before working with an insurance broker?**\n\n*You need to make sure that they are licensed in your state", "answer": " 2"}

If the distance is less than 5 blocks, the answer is the distance\n\n2. If the distance is greater than 5 blocks, we need to add 5 minutes to the answer for each block, including the 1 block it takes her to finish her bike 5 miles \n\n**Time to go the distance**\n```\nYolenda's time is 10/60 = 0.167\nHer husband's time is 40/30 = 1\n```  \nHer time would be 1 + 5 + 5 = 7 minutes  \nHer husband's would be 128/100 = 1.28 + 5 minuts= 17.28 \n\n```\nThe time it takes her husband to turn around is subtracted from his total time\nTime for husband is 40/45 -  1.28 =.28  subtracted from total 17.2 = 17.2 - 0.28 = 16.92 \n```\n\nSo after her husband turns around we have 5 minutes and then he drives at 45 miles to meet her.  \n\n```\nAfter we calculate her time we use those times to add to the total. The difference between the times, 1.28 - 0.168 = 0.112, is 1 extra minute \nThe time is 7 min+16 min= 23 min + 1.28 = 24.28 min + 1.112 = 25.39 + 0.11 * 16 = 25.4912 minutes```\n\n### Source:\n[You can see it here](https://youtu.be/R0DY", "answer": " 15"}

She took $23 and bought a pair off earrings. Then she took $80 and purchased a necklace. $80 was the entire amount of money she saved.\n\n### Inputs\n\nThis is a math problem.\n\n### Responses\n\nThis equation is a little too tough, but I'll be happy to do it. So let's start we're the first equation is x plus 3x plus 7 is equal to negative 45. So that's how I would start to solve for the first one. x plus 3x+ 7 or that's equal to negative 4x plus 42, to solve that in standard method and I'll try to remember this. So I need to solve, I need to solve for the, the minus sign and the minus sign goes on top right, my brain knows that. So 4x plus 3x equals 42, I need to get this on the left hand side negative. So I could multiply by negative 1 and go negative 4x. And it still equals 42, but I need to bring it down to the zero and you solve for x. So we got minus 4x equals 42/1, it's just one minus 4x is 42 minus 4. That's not going to work because it's plus 4 and it's minus 4x I couldn't get that out, the answer is gonna be zero, I'll have to put this over and we'll have that when I factor out the minus 4 x. So I would say that this is the answer, that we can't solve it, they are using x to solve their equation.\n\n### Challenge:Write the response below in standard mode.\n\n### Task\n\nI can't seem to figure this out, so how do I say it's a math problem and how would I do the right of way.\n\n### Rubric:\n\n###", "answer": " 9"}

So you must multiply the starting and ending floors. In this case 9 and 16. That gives you 9 x 16 = 144 and then the ending value was 16 x 8 = 128. Therefore, you get 19 which is the answer.|", "answer": " 13"}

Choices:  Things that we need to stay  healthy\n\nAnswer: Food, water, exercise and air.\n\nInput:\"Climate Change Impacts: The burning of fossil fuels is releasing increasing amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) is into the atmosphere. This is increasing the concentration of CO2. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased 40% since the industrial era. Since the Earth has limited CO2 carrying capacity (the so  called atmospheric saturation state), the higher level of CO2 in the air will cause the Earth\u2019s temperature to rise. Higher temperatures lead to further increases in CO2 levels and an accelerating, self-reinforcing cycle. To prevent global temperature from rising further, we must urgently and drastically reduce emissions of CO2 and other high  carbon compounds to near zero. The longer we do nothing, the more likely it will be  that dangerous tipping points will be reached, leading to a self  reinforcing cycle which will be very hard to reverse.  The Earth\u2019s natural climate is controlled by a \u2018thermostat\u2019 which keeps global warming, over periods of many hundreds", "answer": " 15"}

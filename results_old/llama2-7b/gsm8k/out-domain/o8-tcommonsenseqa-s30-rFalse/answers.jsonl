{"text": "If there are 3, and we consider the possibility of sharing between siblings, each child who has a chance at a banana, and each child will get 10/12 of the bananas each, it would be 25/12 or 2\n\n### Input : A group of 13 monkeys collected 7 piles of bananas, with each pile having bananas, some piles had no monkeys on it, leaving a total of 6 piles had on them. After 6 monkeys split the banana equally amongst themselves, how many bananas were there?\n### Demonstartion\n\n-   The number of bananas for each monkey is 21/3\n-   The number will be 20 if all of monkeys eat the same number of bananas.\n-   The answer if 20, because the number is not 7/3 because the the two bananas that are left is not divided between two people.\n### Conclusion\nThe best approach to solving this maths is dividing 7 and 13 in half to two thirds and then dividing the two thirds equally amongst themselves.The approach could lead to 7/3 as the total number of piles monkeys ate from, and 13/3 left behind after the first division. 6 of 7 thirds were left behind, and 7 of the third left was ate. This answer would be wrong since the left behind part of 1/3 was not 4/3 divided. This shows that the total of 10/3 is less than the total of 20/3.If you were to divide 13 by both 2 and 3, you will see that 13 cannot be divided by 2 because of the remainder, and it cannot be divided properly by 3 because the remainder is again one. 7/13 is the remainder when the fraction 7 into 13 is done.\n### Summary\nThe best approach to diving by 3 or 5 digits into a 3-digit or 5-digit number is by using an empty slot to fill the place. If you choose a number for the empty slot, you may then divide it into 3 or 5 digit numbers. Suppose you choose as the number of digits in the number; then, we divide", "answer": " 99"}
{"text": "Carolyn practices for 20 minutes per day on the piano and the same for the violin, since that amounts to 24 hours of practicing a month, since the month has 7680mins. So, the math is: ( 24 * 6 ) * 7680 = 70760mins\n\n* If she practices six days a week, then divide 7680 by 6. So, Carolyn will practice violin and piano for 5,850mins a week. Or, ( 5,85) * 6 = 34,950mins in a month.\n\n### Detailed Solution:\n\nFor the duration of the 6 days of the week, she practices violin for 481,600 minutes. That's (481600mins / 6) = 802,666666mins, per day. So, if this goes on for the entire month, then the total would be 241600m / 6 = 4026666m.

{"text": "Glenn does not necessarily spend $30 ($60 - $20 = $40 + $30) if the prices are $5 on Monday, twice as much as Monday on Wednesday, and 5 times as much as Monday. Let d be the price on the day Glenn goes to the movies. Since the prices increase by $2 each week, and $5, the next prices after the current day are d + 2 and d + 3.  The cost of going to the movies on $2 days are given by the equation C = 10d.  Glenn goes to the theater on a 5 day and a 2 day, so that means his total cost is 10d + 5d + 10d + (d + 2) + (d+3) = 40.

If the car is traveling less than 20 miles per hour, what will be the speed of the car?\n\n### Demostration:\n\nGiven that X + Y = Z and X + Y + Z = 45, we can see that Z is equal to the remaining digits of X + Y and thus 45 can be represented by Y. Plugging this into the original equations, we obtain: (X*Y) is equal to X and Y is equal to Z.  Thus, the car is traveling as fast as X*Y.\n\n### Response\nGiven that the car\u2019s license plate contains the digits 4 and 5, the car is travel less than 20 mph.

You also can assume that all answer have the 'correctness' and are correct. All that is left is the actual answer, given the question.\n\nFirst thing to do is make a list. I think the question is probably a string/word. So the question is a string. Now we need to make a list with a size so we can find the index of the answer. We also need every answer in sequence. What you didn't specify would mean that we only want one answer. So we need a list with 1 index and 1 string.

(b) The jar was not measured at the start of the experiment so there is no initial number of beans in the jar.  How many beans are in the jar?\n\n### Dem:In order to solve this problem, the scientist will need to write and hypothesis to guide the experiment.

{"text": "He profited $2000\n\n### Output:If all the lottery tickets were the same amount, then this would apply to each individual ticket purchased. However, we know that the probability of winning the lottery is very low. We can use the following formula:\n\n\n\n\tP(x)=1/20\n\n\tP(w)=1/16\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x dollars and P(w) is the probability of winning w dollars.\n\nThe first formula describes the probability of one winning 2 dollars while the second describes the probability of any winning at least 5 dollars. The key phrase here is \"at least\", which tells us what to do after we calculate either formula.\n\nThus we can simply take P(x) times the number of lottery tickets purchased. However, note that there is no prize with a value of exactly 5 dollars. Therefore, we use the average amount of the remaining prizes, that is, the average of 10 dollars.\n\nThe last step is to use our knowledge from above to calculate the number of lottery winners (winners have a value of 5 dollars or greater). We can do this by taking the inverse-function of P(x) and multiplying that times itself which equals:\n\n\n\n  !($5*P(5))/0.2\n\nThus James wins around $18,000.\n\n### Input 1:Ann sells 100 hamburgers and 200 hot dogs for $5.00. 2% of the hamburgers were not sold. 10% of the hot dogs were returned by the customer.

First you need to remember the question says that she made three times as many animals. This is easy and since she has a large, medium, and small animal all it needs is that 3 x = 3. The three means that you multiply 3 by each animal. However, to do this you need to count so if large = 4 small =2. So Large multiplied by 3 would be...\n3 x 4 = 12\n\nYou have 12 sticks for the animals so...\n\nMedium = 3 Small = 4\n\nThree times Medium as Small = 12 / 6 = 2 sticks\n\nThe rest she can just give us.\n\n12 - 2 = 10 sticks.", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "5\n### Justification:\nIn this case, I had been given a solution. First of all i had been taught in school what is simple interest. Simple interest is the amount of interest earned on a deposit over a specified period, without adding any additional money to the original deposit. So simple interest is the amount of money earned by depositing an amount of money at interest rate for a certain period.\n\nIn addition to, in this case there is a question which makes the scientists to check the results. So the scientist will come out with a calculation to come with a better understanding of the results. So if the rate is r, then the amount of money earned is (r*10,000) so 5 rounds is 5*r*10, 000 and the rounds for each ceiling is (5/28). If the rate per ceiling is 4%, then the earnings per ceiling is (4*10, 2.000*10 0.800*10, 6.000*4, 0.240). After calculations i found the earnings as ( 0.80, 0 * (5*10) ). So, as the scientist i will be earning of 400,000*28, which is a total of $2,280,000.\n\nIn the question that is, Michelangelo had painting 12 ceilings. But the next week it is going to be halved. I had been given the solution that this can only mean a certain number, and if it is more than the answer will be no and the answer will be negative (-).\n\nThe next answer is 14 ceilings, which means Michelangelo had been painting 14 of the ceilings and then after next week, there will be 4 left to paint.\n\n### Reflection:\nThere was two questions but I had understood one and the other one i had not yet understood.

And its order is the same as that of the sentence with the adverbial time expression.\n\n> When\nThere are many different meanings of the word \u201cwhen.\u201d In some sentences, when means \u201cnot till when,\u201d indicating a specific time [e.g., \u201cHe'll do it when he gets there.\u201d \u201cEveryone will come when they've finished their work.\u201d]\n\n#### Examples:\nThe event occurred", "answer": " 40"}

There are a total of 41 available bedrooms in the two hotels she has chosen, Alice gets the same number from both places. However, the hotels use different price rules. One asks for $25 to occupy a room and charges the same no matter how many people are in the room. The other place asks $40 for one of the available bedroom. For each room, there is a limit of four people, so no more than two of the rooms in the hotel may be occupied. If the hotel is full, the reservation must be put on a wait list. However, the wait list has 160 people all with reservations at 8:00 AM tomorrow, and the hotel expects a 20% cancellation rate. So, people who are still on the waitlist get their rooms at $30 each as long as the remaining rooms do not stay empty. If there are no other rooms available, the people will be put on the next day's (9:00 AM) reservation list.

{"text": "If you were to look at one 1 hour time period, 25 ants would be in the jar. The number would double each time period, meaning that 50 ants would be in it after one hour. Therefore if you look at 5 time periods, that would mean that 125 ants would have accumulated in the jar. You would need to divide the 125 and the original start number 50 to get that number. After this you will now have the answer 5. This is to represent the original start. When you divide the initial start number which is 50 with the total number of ants which is 125 you get.5 which is rounded down to 0.5 which is then divided by 125 which should give you the answer which is 0.04. If you were to multiply the one number by the other, which would be 50 with 125, that would give you 625 which should be divided to 0.625 which would mean that you would be left with 75.125 which would be rounded down to 75 which should be your desired answer for this sum.", "answer": " 1600"}

{"text": "319\n\n### Rationale:  Let's first find that the final weight is 167 pounds.  3 pounds is half of 6 pounds, so 3 pounds must be half of the weight of the package.  2 pounds is 1 pound less than (the other part) half of the weight of package, so 2 pounds must be half of (the other part) of half the weight.  So the weight is 6 pounds.  Next, the weight tripled, so 6 becomes 18 pounds.  2 pounds is half (the other part) 18, but the other part of 18 is 9 so 2 pounds is also 9 pounds, so now the weight is 9 pounds.  2 pounds will bring the weight to 11 pounds, but already it is 9 pounds, so only 2 pounds must be added, causing the weight to be 11 pounds.  2 pounds causes the weight to triple again, so it is now 33 pounds.  Since there are 9 pounds left, a double means 90 pounds.  Now, there are only 10 pounds left, 69 pounds to be exact, so another 2 pounds will cause the weight to be 71 pounds.\n\n### Input:[830 to 970] = [1500]\n### Response:[1050 to 1140] = [90]\n### Rationale:(850 to 975) = (125) so 1500 = 650 + 850 + 90 + (35 + 45) = 1140\n\n### Input:(1250 to 1396] = [146]\n\n### Rational:\n850 = (300 - 6)\n986 = (30 + 18)\n1428 = (179 + 28 + 46)\n1567 = (30 + (3 + 12 + 17))\n\n### Input:: 2:3 = 1 : 2\n### Response:\n7 : 9 = [7, 2, 5]\n#### Rationale: 6", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "Five people travel from Monday through Sunday.\n\n### Rationale:Let S represent week with total cars is 5.\nS=[5,5,6,6,7,5]\n\n### Explanation:First of all, we can get all the possible combinations and count the frequency of each possible combination on Monday through Sunday, which can be represented by [Cm,Ct,Ct+1,..,...,C5].  Next, we need to find out how many combinations on each weekday can meet the requirement to Monday through Sunday. The answer is 0 on Monday because at least one car is lost on Monday. We can choose the other five cars to replace the previous car. In other words, if Monday cars are Cm-1, Cm-2, Cm-3,....., Cm-2 cars, the combination is impossible because the last car Cm-2+1 is not greater than 5. At this time, we find that we will start with Monday cars at Cm-1, and we can meet the demands. So, we can find out how many combinations that we can pass for Monday through Sunday on Monday to find each possible combination of cars.\nNext, we can continue the process to find out the possible combinations on Thursday and Friday. We always start from Wednesday. We can find out how many possible combinations that we can select five cars from Wednesday through Sunday. In this way, we can continue the following rules till Sunday. We can make a matrix with total cars, each possible combinations of cars, with its number of cars.\nNext step, we can draw the total cars in the matrix and draw the number of combinations with each number of cars on each day. \nNext step, we add the row vectors and column vectors of the matrix. Then we can find out  how many vectors are equal to 5.\n\n\n### Input:\"Who is smarter, the average intelligence or the person who can tell you anything about it?\"\n\n### Response:\"The person who is the average intelligence.\"\n\n### Rational: \n\n### Explantion: \n\n## Input:How can the number line be used to solve the real life situations as in the case of a person who is 42?

In regards to the weasels, you must subtract the foxes, 3 foxes, 3 x 5 = 15, then you multiply that by your original number which leaves you with 85.

So 3 weeks later \u2013 3 foxes \u2013 405 rabbits = -390, which leaves you -390 rabbits. So a total of 390 rabbits are left.\n\n### Input : There are 20 students at a party. Five are wearing black dresses, 5 are wearing shirts, while the rest are wearing both black dress and black shirts. If 2 of the students are selected at random, then what is the probability that all 2 are wearing black clothing?\n\n### Demostration:\nIn this situation i took the 20 students in the party, and after that i separated them into 3 different types, because the problem said that they were separated in black shirt/dress, shirts/no black dress and shirt and black dress. I did this by taking five students from the first section and they wore black dresses, 1 student from the second section wore a shirt and then all the ones with the black dresses added up to 5, then took 5 students with shirts on (in this scenario) and they added up to 5. Then the ones with the black shirts and black dresses had a total of 0. That way you can know what the total number of the dresses and shirts are out of 20 people.\n\n### Then i used conditional probability to get to the answer,", "answer": " 96"}

The formula to multiply a quadratic polynomial is found by multiplying its factors as follows: a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = (a + b) (a - b)\n\nIn other words to multiply x ^ 2 + 3 x + 4 by the factor x^2 - 1 and b^2-3b+1, we substitute x for 2 and b for 1 to get x 2 \u2013 2 and b 2 \u2013 2. \t\n\nTherefore b ^ 2 = 1 + 1 or b = 2; b ^ 2 - 2 = 1-2 or 1. \n\nTherefore b = -1 to get (x + 2) (x - 1)\n\nDividing (x \u2013 0 \u2013 1)^2 by (0-1), we get x^2 \u2013 2.\nDividing (2 + 1)^2 by 2, we get 3.\nThis process is the same for the other quantity but when we multiply it 2x \u2013 1 = x^2 \u2013 1, and 3x + 4 = 2x^3 \u2013 3x^2\u2009+\u20094x.

{"text": "$2989\n\n### Expectation: The question states that Salvador earned $1950. If Santo earned half of what Salvador earned, then he must have earned an amount half the value of the other which is $1950, which means together the two men should have earned $3900. However, this calculation is not what was requested. The question is requesting that you find out how much money the two men earned together. To do this we must figure out the two men earned together which can be found out by taking the amount one man earned and dividing it by 2. Since the person earned $1000 Salvador earned half of that which is $500 and Santo earned half of that to make a total of $3900 since Salvador earned the original amount.\n\n### Response1: Salvador earned $100, Santo earned $100\n\n### Expected: Since the question was simply about money, and does not request any form of identification, I was able to conclude that it was irrelevant to the question and thus not necessary in the response.\n\nResponse1: Salvador earned $400, Santo earned nothing\n\n### Exact: Using this way of reasoning it is logical to think that $400-$1956 is $2054. Because $2054 is twice the amount of money that Santo earned, it means it took two people working together that earned $1955 for one to make the extra money Santo earned. So if two people combined their earnings the result would be twice as much as $400, which is also $800.\n\nResponse2: Salvador earned $1900, Santo earned $-506\n\n### Explanation: In this solution I was able to add the same type of reasoning that I did in the previous solution to find the value of the whole amount to find the value of each individual amount. I then did the arithmetic operation inverse of the one I used before but in a reversed order that is because instead of having the two values divided by two, I had to subtract 1 from the result. Lastly I had to add $49 to Santo's value to find the full amount since the question asked for the individual amount to add together, and that makes no sense since there is no need to add something to $800.", "answer": " 2934"}

First things first, students should fill in the proper variables to correctly solve the problem.  In this case, 30 X 4 = 120, and we add the numbers of students in each 5th grade class to get the total students.  So in the end, there would be 30 X 3 = 90, 30 X1 = 30, 30 + 4 = 34, 34 X 4 = 30 + 2 = 17, and finally we add all of these together: $2.10 + $0.50 + $0.10 = $2.60 = $1.70.\n\nWe should always try to avoid spending all of our time answering questions incorrectly in order to maximize our time on the assessment.  In this case it is clear the student is not on the right track.  They need to double check the math is right before moving forward.  They may want to try and get some extra help during the test.  Or they may want to do some practice tests on the web to find more strategies to answer these types of questions!\n\nIn this scenario, the student used this wrong math equations to justify their answer choice.\n\nAnswer: $2.25$\n\nThis is wrong because adding $120 \\times 4$ = $480$ and then adding $4 \\times 6$ = $24$ is $504$, not $500$.\n\n$273.2$\n\nThis is too big!  In this problem, you just need to find $90+17+4$ which equals $111$, not $120$.  (Sorry to sound so rude but a little math is too much to ask for this level of logic!  I wonder how well you will do when you can't rely on Google to tell you if you're wrong or not!)\n\n$0$\n\nThe explanation from the student is too short, missing most of", "answer": " 1036"}

{"text": "The lake is 5 miles long, and Marcos has 10 minutes to make it to work. The question asks how fast he must travel to make it in 10 minutes.\n\nThe way to solve this is as follows. Multiply the distance of 10 with the unit of time 10 minutes. This results in the 10 minute block of time as equaling 0.2 unit of time. Convert the result 0.2 into miles per hours and divide it by 8, 8 being the miles travelled in the given time per hour. To finish the math, 0.2 divided by 8 equals 0.025 miles per hour, which is equal to 1/40th of a mile per hour.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nWe learned through this exercise to follow this guide:\n\n1.

A tree, then, can't grow faster than 10% a year. It grew by at least 20 meters each year from 2013 to 2016. Growth slowed in 2017 to at most 10% a little, and then slowed a little more in 2018. When it finally had only grown 100 meters in 2019, it would have grown between 106.9 meters (assuming no growth in the second half of the year) and 107.35 meters (assuming that it had been growing at 10% a month). This means it grew by anywhere between 10 and 10.2, which can also be thought of as between 1000 and 1002. So total growth from 2016 to 2019 was between 1090 and 1102 meters.

A boat 3 feet wide will have 2 feet of space between each boat. \n\n### Solution:\n\nInput:\n\nA boat is a square with one side being 3 feet long. It needs 2 feet to be between the boat and the shoreline because it has to pass through the other boat.\n\nThis will allow 3 boats fit on a side that is 42 ft/3 = 14 ft. 14 ft * 3 = 42 ft\n\nIf I take 1 row of 3 and they all fit in the 42 feet of space, it only takes one row. Then, in a second row, all 3 fit. Then, in a third row and fourth and so on.\n\n### Input-2:\n\nA river is to be use for a boat race.\n\nIf each boat is 3 ft across and they must have 2 ft between them at least or else, they will hit the shore.\n\nThen how many rows do you have to make to use all 42 ft space?\n\n### Solution-2:\n\nEach row is made up of 3 feet wide boats.

{"text": "Carla should spend $63.75 gas money.\n\nCalculation: The distance between the school and soccer practice is twice the length between the school and picking up the kids. Therefore, the distance between the school and the car washing place= (the distance between the school x 2)+ (the distance between picking up the kiddos x 2)= 10 miles. \n\nFirst Carla is traveling from the grocery store to school and the grocery store is 8 miles from home.  The total distance to get to the school is 8+10+8= 26 miles. The next step would be to fill the gas tank that has a fuel capacity of 17.5 gallons.  When Carla is traveling 26 miles her car will only use about 2.5 gallons of gas. This means that there are 8.5 miles left to travel.  There is a problem with the last few minutes.  There is an additional 4 miles to add to the total, which means that she will be using approximately another 1.5 gallons of fuel, which would equal 10 miles and would be using almost all of her gas left.\n\nCarla is traveling from Grocery store to school then from school to soccer practice.  From the grocery store and school it needs to travel back to get all the kids to the soccer practice and then from the practice to the house.   If it travels the same 10 miles one way, then that would amount to 20 miles.  Then there is another 20 miles one way to get from the grocery story to the house.  The total to travel from home to the grocery and back is 44 miles.  This travel is in addition to 20 miles to travel from the school to the soccer place and back. Thus far, there is a total of 64 miles.\n\nTotal travel time is 2(school to soccer) + 2(school to grocery + soccer to garage.)= 36 miles  \nThis all makes about 2 gallons since this total will use 8.5 since that was the 1st stop.

We end up needing to measure 101.5. Secondly, we need to measure my daughters height by 12. She is 4'7\", which means we need to measure 57. After we have measures the two heights, we simply take the first and subtract the second. In this simple example we end up with 44.6 inches difference. After we have measured the two heights, now it is just a simple matter of dividing the original number by 44.6. Since 6 + 44.6 = 50.6, this means that I am only 4 percent taller than my daughter, and my daughter happens to be four percent shorter than me.\n\n### Demo:\nInput: Dividing the distance into two ways ( 762 / 14 )\nOutput\nAnswer: 55\n\n### Demo answer:", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "18 total\n\nWe will get into the steps I took to solve this problem in a few moments.  First, I should point out that I solved this problem using a technique from combinatorics called permutations. Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics dedicated to counting, not a skill that is required to build an app for Instructables.  Using this technique is helpful for any problem where you have to arrange elements in some order, such as choosing colors in a rainbow.\n\nThe basic principle is pretty simple: if I had 24 puppies and I wanted to arrange them in order, I could do it in multiple ways.\n\nHere is an explicit method for solving a problem where each possible arrangement is called a permutation,\n\n    A = 6!  --   This is because I have 6 options per position in the sequence, so using the factorial we have,  6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1\n\n    A = A0!\n\n    B = B1!\n\n    B0 + B1 means:\n    The first time there are no options, so the number of arrangements is 1!\n\n    The second time, there is 1 option, and that's 1!\n\nRepeating this same method will give you the total number of permutations.\n\nLet's try to use permutations to find the number of dogs walking in 18 leashes.\n\nThe number of dogs walking in two leashes is\n\n    2!\n\nThe number of ways of selecting first and second dogs walking is:\n\n    3!\n\nNow, the order they walk in isn't important, so we'll use the symbol for \"random\".\n\nTotal combinations, number of dogs that could end up walking in first and second leash:\n\n     3!\n\nNow consider the third leash...\n\n    3! * (number of ways to pick first and second in that order)\n\nThat 3! is the permutation of only two elements we took care of earlier, so we could also just use 2! again to count permutations.\n\nHowever, not every arrangement of leashes contains a valid arrangement of dogs, so we shouldn't just multiply the number of dogs in the leashes by the number of possible combinations.", "answer": " 5"}

How many weeks do I need to work before I can get my new phone?\n\nIf we let x be the number of babysitting we need to work, then $240 = $800 + x. Now we can set this equal to x and solve for \"x\". $800+x = x. $800 = x.

She decided to solve this question by starting by finding the day of the week that was Diane's birthday, because she knew that this was always the day of the week she started any work involving something from her life, and then she would multiply her birthday by 10, to the next higher value of 10, and then adding 4. The value she obtained in this way was 500. Can you help Diane solve for the number of days it will take her to finish building her doghouse?\n\n## Solution\n\nLet's assume birthday is an integer, the date is in the format dd/mm/yyyy, the number of days from Diane's birth to the first day of building the doghouse is in the range [0,500], so day of the month is in the range [1,12].\n\nIf days from the birth is 500 is the birthday is July 2,2010, Diane is counting from July 2,2100 to July 4,2010 including July 4,2100.\n\n2.\nAssuming the birthday is, as in the day of the week. Let's assume the days of the week is: 1~Sunday,2~Monday,... 7~Saturday.

Diane is counting from Monday,2010 to Sunday,2010.\n\n3.\nAssuming the day of the month, we only need to count 1~12, so we only need to take integer values of day of the month from 1~12.\nDiane is counting from 1,2010 (1st day is Saturday in the julian calendar) to 1,2009 (2009 0th month is January, 0th day is 1", "answer": " 325"}
